<span class="headword">Jourdain,  (Emily) Margaret</span>  (1876&#150;1951), <span class="occ">historian of English furniture and decoration</span>, was born on 15 August 1876 in Derwent, Derbyshire, the eighth of ten children of the Revd Francis Jourdain (1834&#150;1898) and his wife, Emily, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5558/', "Charles Clay")</script>, a Manchester surgeon. As the hard-up daughter of a hard-up country parson, surrounded by caustic and highly competitive siblings, Margaret grew up sardonic, independent, and unorthodox. She rejected Christianity at an early age, declaring firmly to her governess, &#145;I don't want to hear any more about that poor man&#146;  (Spurling, <span class="italic">Ivy when Young</span>, 1.260).<br>
<br>Margaret shared her scholarly approach with her eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34245/', "Francis Charles Robert Jourdain")</script>&#151;himself a comparable pioneer in the field of ornithology&#151;and her refusal to acknowledge sexual restrictions with her eldest sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48446/', "Eleanor Frances Jourdain")</script>, principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford (and author, with C. A. E. Moberly, of <span class="italic">An Adventure</span>, 1911). Another brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51747/', "Philip Edward Bertrand Jourdain")</script>, historian of mathematics and logic. Margaret herself read classics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, left with a third-class degree in 1897, and afterwards earned a precarious living as editor, translator, and book reviewer. Her chief patron was Lord Alfred Douglas, who, as editor of <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, published her collection of prose poems, <span class="italic">An Outdoor Breviary</span>, in 1909.<br>
<br>But literary ambition was overtaken by a growing interest in the still virtually unexplored history of interior decoration and furnishing. In the early years of the century Margaret began writing up her researches in a steady stream of articles covering the field from chintzes to Chinese wallpapers, stumpwork to samplers, tea caddies, knife cases, card tables, and cradles. It was her knowledgeable and authoritative contributions that helped transform <span class="italic">Country Life</span> from a relatively lightweight, romantic magazine into what Walter Runciman called &#145;the keeper of the architectural conscience of the nation&#146;  (Spurling, <span class="italic">Secrets of a Woman's Heart</span>, 90). She spearheaded a shift in taste away from Victorian ostentation, fussiness, and clutter to an earlier simplicity and severity. In <span class="italic">Furniture in England from 1660 to 1760</span> (1914), together with its companion volume on decoration, she was the first to rediscover English Palladian design, to insist on the importance of historical context, and to rehabilitate the virtually forgotten William Kent (her monograph, <span class="italic">The Work of William Kent</span>, appeared in 1948).<br>
<br>Margaret Jourdain published her first two furniture books under the name of the fashionable interior decorator Francis Lenygon, and her <span class="italic">Decorative Arts in England (1760&#150;1880)</span> under the name of a Birmingham coach builder called H. H. Mulliner. Both men profited from her literary abilities, providing her in return with a practical expertise that she could have got nowhere else. In the furniture world she had, in the words of Ralph Edwards, keeper of the Victoria and Albert Museum's woodwork department, &#145;few rivals and no superiors&#146;  (private information). Edwards was one of a whole generation of young men, trained by Margaret in the 1920s and 1930s, who went on to fill major posts in the national museums, the National Trust, and the great London auction houses. Younger women whose careers blossomed under her guidance included Joan Evans, Freya Stark, and Ivy Compton-Burnett.<br>
<br>Margaret Jourdain set up house in 1919 with Ivy Compton-Burnett, who published the first of her singular novels six years later. Contemporaries maintained that Ivy owed much as a novelist to Margaret's dry, deflationary wit and profoundly sceptical intelligence. Margaret's own books remained erudite, austerely factual, and frequently first in the field. She was one of ten contributors to the three-volume <span class="italic">Dictionary of English Furniture</span> (1924&#150;7), edited by Edwards and Percy Macquoid, and her <span class="italic">Georgian Cabinet-Makers</span> (1944), written with Edwards, gave long overdue recognition to designers other than Thomas Chippendale, George Hepplewhite, and Thomas Sheraton.<br>
<br>Margaret Jourdain in her prime inspired terror, awe, and in some bold spirits affection. Squat, broad, and plain, she wore dashing plumed hats, lace jabots, feather boas, and a Georgian spyglass on a gold chain. Teatime anecdotes from the hospitable table she and Ivy kept at their flat in South Kensington have passed into London literary legend. Margaret never married for the same reasons as the character in one of Ivy Compton-Burnett's novels, who said, when asked if she would not have liked a full, normal life, &#145;No. I don't want the things it would be full of&#146;  (I. Compton-Burnett, <span class="italic">Parents and Children</span>, 1972, 86). Margaret Jourdain died from heart failure on 6 April 1951 in Charing Cross Hospital, London.<br>
