<span class="headword">Roberts,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1722&#150;1748), <span class="occ">actor</span>, is of unknown parents or upbringing. By 1724 he was married to an actress, known only as Mrs John Roberts, who predeceased him. No image survives but accounts emphasize Roberts's serious demeanour. In 1733 Aaron Hill advised that while &#145;nobody speaks with more weight and significance&#146;, Roberts might &#145;quicken and inspirit the solemnity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.169). Although Roberts played a variety of roles, including comic ones, as early as 1728, he was cast as Gloucester in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> and often portrayed sombre characters.<br>
<br>Roberts's earliest recorded performance was on 19 February 1722 at Drury Lane, where he remained through the season of 1723&#150;4. He and his wife were removed from that theatre's payroll on 9 September 1726, and both disappeared from the records until John returned to Drury Lane two years later in more significant roles. Roberts and his wife appeared at Richmond in the summer of 1724, and regularly performed at Southwark and Bartholomew fairs.<br>
<br>In 1729 Roberts published <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr Pope's Preface to Shakespear</span> refuting Pope's attacks on actors as the source of errors in the bard's texts. His arguments reveal an extensive knowledge of theatrical history, and precede similar points made by Lewis Theobald in the preface to his edition of Shakespeare (1733). He also drew two sketches of a performance in 1738 of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> that record the essential conservatism of eighteenth-century staging.<br>
<br>Although Roberts was in the Fleet in late January 1732, his career recovered and he played leading roles in provincial performances in Canterbury (Macbeth and Lear, 1733) and Norwich (Balance in Farquhar's <span class="italic">Recruiting Officer</span> and Othello, 1735). He shifted his London activities to Covent Garden, where he closed with a benefit performance on 14 May 1742. He appeared as Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> at Goodmans' Fields Theatre in 1745, and may have been active in York <i>c</i>.1748, but was referred to as &#145;the late Mr. <i>John Roberts</i>&#146; in 1755, when Charlotte Charke praised his depiction of Husband opposite her Wife in Lillo's <span class="italic">Fatal Curiosity</span>  (Charke, 64&#150;5).<br>
