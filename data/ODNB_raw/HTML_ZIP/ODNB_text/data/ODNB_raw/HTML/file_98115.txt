<span class="headword">Prichard,  Hesketh Vernon  Hesketh-</span>  (1876&#150;1922), <span class="occ">explorer and marksman</span>, was born at Jhansi, India, on 17 November 1876, the son of Lieutenant Hesketh Brodrick Prichard (1851&#150;1876) of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, and his wife, Katherine O'Brien, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ryall (1852&#150;1935). On the premature death of his father (six weeks before his son was born) he was brought to Britain, where he attended preparatory schools at Gorey in Jersey, Rugby, and Nuneaton, from where he won a scholarship to Fettes College. His intention was to pursue a career in the army, but he was prevented from doing so by the discovery that he had a weak heart. He was, however, outwardly fit, notably tall (6 feet 4 inches&#151;2 inches less than his father) and a fine sportsman. After making a start at studying law he began the shooting and exploring expeditions, and the writing, that brought him worldwide fame.<br>
<br>From 1897 Hesketh-Prichard was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, forming a close friendship with the magazine's editor, Reginald Smith. Much of his writing was undertaken in an unusual literary partnership with his mother, Katherine (or Kate) O'Brien Hesketh-Prichard. Together they wrote a series of swashbuckling stories, published in the <span class="italic">Badminton Magazine</span> from 1898 and accumulated in <span class="italic">The Chronicles of Don Q</span> (1904), a Zorro-like Spanish brigand. Mother and son, who sometimes wrote as E. and H. Heron, also contributed twelve ghost stories to <span class="italic">Pearson's Monthly Magazine</span>, published as a book in 1899. In 1913 he was chairman of the Authors' Society.<br>
<br>Hesketh-Prichard's early travel writing was undertaken on behalf of Arthur Pearson, the owner of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. <span class="italic">Where Black Rules White: a Journey Across and About Hayti</span> (1900), described his observation of vaudoux (voodoo) rites on the island, whose economic decline and political corruption he discussed in terms of the unfitness of its inhabitants for self-government. Pearson next sent him on an expedition to Patagonia (1900&#150;01) to look for a reported giant ground sloth, the mylodon. He penetrated the Andes further than any western explorer to date, but found no sign of the creature. His experiences, which inspired parts of Arthur Conan Doyle's <span class="italic">Lost World</span>, were recounted in <span class="italic">Through the Heart of Patagonia</span> (1902).<br>
<br>An extremely accomplished rifle shot and noted big-game hunter, Hesketh-Prichard travelled widely on shooting expeditions, including Newfoundland and Labrador with John Guile Millais in 1903 and E. G. Wynyard in 1904 to hunt caribou. A subsequent expedition to the interior of Labrador with Alfred and Geoffrey Gathorne-Hardy, through regions where previous explorers had perished, was described in <span class="italic">Through Trackless Labrador</span> (1911). He also hunted elk in Norway and moufflon in Sardinia. He married, on 1 June 1908, Lady Elizabeth Grimston (1885&#150;1975), daughter of James Walter Grimston, third earl of Verulam, and with whom he had a daughter and two sons. Part of their honeymoon was spent in hunting a bull grey seal. He nevertheless deplored the indiscriminate clubbing of seals, for negligible commercial benefit, that had brought them to the verge of extinction in the Outer Hebrides, and was a prime mover in securing the <span class="roman">Grey Seals Protection Act</span> of 1914, legislation that forbade the killing of seals during the breeding season. He was also a keen ornithologist, and promoted legislation to protect wild birds by forbidding the importation of feathers and bird skins for use in the fashion industry. He was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>Hesketh-Prichard was also a handy amateur county cricketer, playing for Hampshire from 1900 to 1913, as a fast bowler with an average of just under twenty runs per wicket. He took 339 first-class wickets. During his best period he was selected three years running (1903&#150;5) for the Gentlemen against the Players.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war, aged thirty-seven, Hesketh-Prichard immediately offered his services to the army but could only secure a commission on the special list as an assistant press officer on the general staff. He made his first visit to the western front in March 1915, and reported on the clear domination of German sniping over the British lines, demoralizing trench-bound forces by inflicting steady losses. He was attached to general headquarters British expeditionary force in May 1915, working in the intelligence department as an officer in charge of war correspondents. In this free-ranging capacity he was able to observe the sniping efforts of several British units in the days before there were any &#145;sniping officers&#146;. Carrying with him several excellent rifles and telescopic sights of his own, he began by offering to correct the telescopic sights then widely misused by otherwise good marksmen. The improvement in sniping was so marked that he came to the attention of a series of far-sighted commanders who wanted to make use of his skill. Sir Charles Monro, general officer commanding the Third Army, was one of the first to employ him. After some time attached to the 7th corps, he went to the 10th corps, where Colonel Langford Lloyd had started a telescopic sight school. His friend John Buchan enlisted the help of such influential figures as Lord Haldane and John St Loe Strachey, editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, to raise funds for the purchase of sights and rifles for use at the front.<br>
<br>Working out of several brigade headquarters, Hesketh-Prichard encouraged the forming of sniping sections, where snipers and observers were paired to work together. The rapid improvement in the sniping skills of the Third Army led Lieutenant-General Haking, general officer commanding the 11th corps, First Army, to ask for his services, to lecture his officers on the subject and to correct the telescopic sights in the corps. As a result the first proper School of Sniping, Observation, and Scouting was set up by the First Army at Linghem in France. Hesketh-Prichard had a staff of six, and trained officers as instructors to return to their units and spread the doctrine. The school was officially recognized by the War Office, with a proper establishment of instructors and craftsmen, on 24 November 1916. The staff of the school were themselves regularly sent into the front-line trenches so that their work was kept acutely relevant at all times.<br>
<br>The important work done in collecting intelligence of a generally useful nature by the observers working with snipers came to be recognized. Special classes were developed to extend these skills. The smallest anomaly could reveal something important. In one famous incident the presence of a particularly contented cat helped to identify a German unit headquarters, which was duly shelled to destruction.<br>
<br>By the middle of the war the whole business of sniping in the British expeditionary force had been placed on such professional lines that it is generally acknowledged that the erstwhile German superiority in that field of activity was overturned. The development of the role of observer and scout contributed to British successes in patrol work, both in dominating no man's land between the trenches and when the war of movement was restored in 1918.<br>
<br>For his own sniping work Hesketh-Prichard was awarded the Military Cross in October 1916; for his work in running the First Army school he was appointed DSO; for his work in training some good sniper teams in the Portuguese corps he was awarded the military order of Avis. He was twice mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted major in November 1916. The excessive overwork damaged his health, and illness took its toll in 1917&#150;18. He told the story of his methods in <span class="italic">Sniping in France</span> (1920).<br>
<br>Hesketh-Prichard died at Gorhambury, St Albans, Hertfordshire, on 14 June 1922, almost certainly from blood poisoning picked up during his war service. His funeral took place at St Albans; after cremation at Golders Green his ashes were placed in the Grimston family vault at St Michael's, St Albans. His widow became woman of the bedchamber to Queen Mary (1924&#150;36), and married in 1927 Major Thomas Augustus Motion, master of foxhounds. The stories he had written with his mother (who outlived him) were made into a film, <span class="italic">Don Q Son of Zorro</span> (1925) starring Douglas Fairbanks. His son Alfgar Cecil Giles Hesketh-Prichard (1916&#150;1944) inherited his sense of adventure and, serving with the Special Operations Executive, died during a mission in Austria in December 1944.<br>
