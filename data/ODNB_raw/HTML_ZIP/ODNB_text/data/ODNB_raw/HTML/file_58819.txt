<span class="headword">MacDiarmada,  Se&aacute;n</span> <span class="st"> [John MacDermott]</span>  (1883&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Irish revolutionary</span>, was born in Kiltyclogher, co. Leitrim, probably on 26 January 1884 (his birth was officially registered as 29 March, but his baptism is recorded as having taken place on 29 January), the son of Daniel MacDermott (<i>d</i>. 1913), a farmer, and his wife, Mary McMorrow. He was educated at Corradoona national school and, having twice failed to get into teacher training college, spent some time working in Scotland before returning to Ireland, where he learned bookkeeping and Irish at night school in Tullynamoyle, co. Cavan.<br>
<br>In 1905 MacDiarmada moved to Belfast, where he worked as a tram conductor and barman and became active in politics, joining the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Gaelic League. He helped to organize the Dungannon clubs, the precursors to Sinn F&eacute;in; for the latter he was party organizer in its (unsuccessful) campaign in the 1908 North Leitrim by-election. About this time he was drawn to the revived Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). It is possible that he was sworn into the organization while still living at home, as his father was a member. He became a full-time organizer for the IRB in Dublin and enjoyed a strong friendship with Tom Clarke, alongside whom he was a prime mover in the power struggle for the leadership of the supreme council of the organization that took place in 1910&#150;11. This battle was also over control of the IRB's journal, <span class="italic">Irish Freedom</span>, of which MacDiarmada became manager. This role, together with his secretaryship of the IRB and&#151;of most significance&#151;his membership, with Clarke, of its all-important three-man executive, put him in a powerful position. He and Clarke were responsible for creating the IRB military council, which planned the 1916 rising&#151;plans that were unknown even to the brotherhood's supreme council.<br>
<br>In 1911 MacDiarmada organized demonstrations against loyalist displays during the king's visit. The following year he was left partially disabled by an illness often identified as polio, but which may have been tuberculosis of the right hip. His incapacity&#151;he walked with a stick thereafter&#151;was said to have sharpened his sense of purpose. He was instrumental in bringing the Gaelic League under the control of advanced nationalists in 1915, and his commitment to revolution received another boost when he was handed a four-month prison sentence with hard labour for his campaign against the recruitment of soldiers in Ireland for the British army in the First World War.<br>
<br>MacDiarmada's highest profile in Irish nationalism was achieved as an organizer of and participant in the Easter rising of 1916; he was one of the seven signatories of the proclamation of the provisional government of the Irish republic. The nationalism which he had always believed in and promoted was that of active revolution and the &#145;blood sacrifice&#146; approach of Padraic Pearse; in a speech to members of the IRB in co. Kerry in 1914 MacDiarmada declared that &#145;Irish patriotic spirit will die forever unless a blood sacrifice is made in the next few years&#146;  (Boyce, 308), with the clear inference that some would have to offer themselves as martyrs. At the Dublin post office in 1916, injuries to others left the direction of the fight in his hands, and the final dispatch from the garrison has been attributed to him. After surrender he was singled out for particular ill treatment by certain guards, and was fatalistic: &#145;There will be executions; I suppose I will be shot; but the executions will create a reaction in this country that will wipe out the slavish pro-English spirit&#146;  (Travers, 37). He was duly executed by firing squad at Kilmainham gaol on 12 May, thus gaining martyrdom status; he was unmarried. His grave is in Arbour Hill cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>MacDiarmada was a popular figure, and an able recruiting sergeant for both the IRB and for the Irish Volunteers. He has been described as a man of charm, enthusiasm, and good looks, &#145;of average height, with strong, dark hair [and] well marked eyebrows over dark blue eyes&#146;  (Travers, 4). Latterly he wore a beard, but he reputedly borrowed a razor to shave with from a British soldier during his final incarceration, telling him, &#145;I have to make a nice corpse, you know&#146;  (Maclochlainn, 167). Appropriately for a former transport worker, the bus depot at Store Street, Dublin, was named after him in recognition of his role in 1916, though a full reappraisal of his significance had to wait until the 1960s when, in a series of radio lectures, F. X. Martin identified him as the &#145;mainspring&#146; of the rising  (Travers, 39). While the importance of his role in turning the IRB into a revolutionary unit was no longer in doubt by the early twenty-first century, he still awaited a full biographical study.<br>
