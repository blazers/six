<span class="headword">McGurk,  John</span>  (1874&#150;1944), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born at Hoyle Mill, Barnsley, on 17 September 1874, the eldest of fifteen children of John McGurk, a miner, and his wife, Hannah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lord). Six months later the family moved to Pendlebury, near Manchester, and at the age of twelve McGurk went to work in a local colliery. He soon began to be active in the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Federation, and secured election as delegate to the federation's monthly conference, and then to its executive.<br>
<br>On 22 February 1908 McGurk was elected to the full-time post of miners' agent covering pits in north-east Lancashire from Oldham round to Burnley and Accrington. His prominence within the coalfield grew; in 1912, he sat as its representative on the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), a position he held on five later occasions. Like almost all miners' officials he was a strong supporter of the allies during the First World War.<br>
<br>McGurk was typical of his generation of mining trade union officials in seeing a commitment to the Labour Party as an integral element in his work. In the general election of December 1918 he stood as the Labour Party candidate in Darwen, sponsored by the miners. His line was firmly patriotic: Germany should be made to pay and the Kaiser should be punished. Yet his revanchism incorporated a class antagonism&#151;&#145;it would not surprise him &hellip; to see the late heads of the German people being entertained at Buckingham Palace before twelve months was over&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northern Daily Telegraph</span>, 9 Dec 1918). McGurk finished third in the poll, as he did again in the contest of November 1922. He fought no further parliamentary contests; his one successful electoral campaign was for a seat on the Bury town council.<br>
<br>McGurk's address from the chair at the Labour Party conference in June 1919 involved an attack on &#145;direct action&#146; and a presentation of the Labour Party and parliament as the way forward. This intervention was particularly significant in the context of debates about the use of industrial methods for political objectives. McGurk's counsel of caution came at a moment of optimism for the MFGB; two years later the federation fought a three-month lock-out in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to protect wartime and immediate post-war gains. During this 1921 struggle, McGurk became a controversial figure with his public assertion that the MFGB had no hope of obtaining one of its principal objects, the national profits pool.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Lancashire as a declining coalfield could be militant on industrial issues and McGurk appeared sometimes within the MFGB as the advocate of a more forward policy. During the 1926 dispute, he played the leading part in the attempt by some of the miners' delegation at that year's TUC to shout down the locomotive men's leader, John Bromley (1876&#150;1945), who had been critical of the MFGB leaders.<br>
<br>After the 1926 defeat McGurk played his part in attempting to maintain effective trade unionism in the depressed Lancashire coalfield; he also stood with the other Lancashire officials to block attempts by the Communist Party to expand their influence in Lancashire. In April 1929 he became Lancashire president; in 1932&#150;3 he sat on the general council of the TUC.<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of war in 1939, McGurk's health began to deteriorate. He resigned the Lancashire presidency in January 1944 and his agent's post eight months later. He died at his home, 92 Haig Road, in Bury, on 22 November 1944. His wife, Eliza, an active member of the Labour Party, had died in July 1943. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>McGurk was a characteristic miners' leader of his generation, a hard but flexible negotiator, a thorough opponent of the left who viewed the Labour Party as the custodian of trade union interests. This pragmatic bargainer was known for his quick temper; Lancashire conferences could be subjected to what one critic described as &#145;language not becoming to a person of his standing&#146;  (<span class="italic">DLB</span>). His power base in a decentralized federation lay in a specific coalfield and his attitudes were influenced by its priorities.<br>
