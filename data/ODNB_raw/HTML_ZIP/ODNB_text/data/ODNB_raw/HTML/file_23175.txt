<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ravis,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1560, <em>d.</em> 1609), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was born at Malden, Surrey, probably the son of Thomas Ravis and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Lisle of Reigate and widow of Robert Benson. Educated at Westminster School, he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, on 6 July 1575. When the college at first refused him entry, alleging that Westminster scholars, though well grounded in grammar, were less proficient in logic than other candidates, Ravis wrote an appeal to Lord Burghley, whose patronage secured his admission. He duly graduated BA on 12 November 1578, and proceeded MA on 3 March 1582, and BD on 6 July 1589. He served as proctor in 1588 and vice-chancellor in 1596/7 and 1597/8. He had been ordained in 1582 and spent some years preaching in and around Oxford, but no benefice is recorded until he obtained the rectory of Merstham, Surrey, in 1591, and the London vicarage of All Hallows Barking by the Tower, on 27 December the same year (vacating in May 1598). On 20 February 1593 he was installed as canon of Westminster, a post he retained until 1607 (his successor being installed on 10 May). He served as chapter treasurer in 1593/4 and for three other yearly terms, and as steward in 1595/6.<br>
<br>After gaining the DD in 1595, Ravis was, on 19 June 1596, appointed to the deanery of Christ Church at the request of Lord Buckhurst, who, as chancellor of Oxford University, felt entitled to exercise the crown's patronage. Ravis's nomination was also supported by Sir Robert Cecil against a nominee of the earl of Essex. Ravis at once introduced unpopular reforms, replacing traditional commons allowances with cash payments. Dudley Carleton, reporting the dean's &#145;great tyranny&#146;, said that Ravis had the support of Archbishop Whitgift, and that some of the college had been sent before the privy council, others imprisoned  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 361). Carleton was still at odds with the dean over his own income in 1603.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1598 Ravis was presented by the dean and chapter of Westminster to their prime living, the vicarage of Islip, Oxfordshire, to which he was instituted on 7 July. On 19 October that year he also became vicar of Wittenham Abbas, Berkshire. Before 11 October 1602 he had married Alice, later wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2909/', "Sir John Borlase")</script>, master of the ordnance of Ireland. He was suggested for the bishopric of Norwich by Whitgift in October 1602, but it was still as a dean that Ravis attended the Hampton Court conference in 1604. His notes were used by Bishop Barlow in his published account of the proceedings. Subsequently Ravis sat on the committee which translated the gospels, the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span>, and the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> for the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was also prolocutor of the lower house of the convocation of Canterbury in 1604, being confirmed as such on 23 March. On 30 May he claimed he had been maliciously subpoenaed by those whose real target was Bancroft; his accusers were themselves promptly arrested by the crown's officers. When in September 1604 it became known that Ravis was to be made bishop of Gloucester and might be allowed to retain his deanery <i>in commendam</i>, the canons of Christ Church protested strongly that their head of house ought to be permanently resident. Nevertheless on 15 February 1605 Ravis duly received licence to hold his deanery, canonry of Westminster, and livings of Islip and Wittenham along with his bishopric. He was consecrated on 17 March and, notwithstanding his dispensation, resigned the deanery of Christ Church (to which a successor was appointed on 1 August 1605). He retained the canonry of Westminster: the prebendal house was a valuable perquisite for a bishop without an official London residence. On 24 March 1606 he preached the accession day sermon at Paul's Cross. His translation to bishop of London was anticipated (suit being made for his Islip living) on 10 April 1607, and came with election on 29 April and confirmation on 18 May.<br>
<br>In his successive episcopates Ravis was a diligent administrator; though an unreconstructed Calvinist, he was a scourge of nonconforming clergy. At Gloucester he won the respect of clerical and county society with his hospitality and careful ministry, at his primary visitation in 1605 reserving almost fifty cases for further consideration. Three nonconformist clergy were eventually ejected. He later rarely missed sessions of his consistory court, save in parliament time; he brought sanitation and other improvements to the episcopal residences, and at London personally examined ordinands and encouraged training for non-preaching clergy, sending at least a dozen to the archdeacons for this purpose. He continued to press for conformity, and reported the worst cases to the high commission. &#145;By the help of Jesu&#146;, he told Richard Rogers, &#145;I will not leave one preacher in my dioces that doth not subscribe&#146;  (Knappen, 31). Five lecturers were suspended, and as many beneficed clergy deprived.<br>
<br>Ravis's wife was the sole executor named in his will of 12 November 1609; the overseers were his brother-in-law, Thomas Edwardes LLD, and Nicholas Kempe. Ravis died on 14 November 1609, probably in London, and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
