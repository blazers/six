<span class="headword">Bishop,  John</span>  (1664/5&#150;1737), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was seventy-two at the time of his death, and so was probably born in late 1664 or in 1665, quite possibly in Gloucester, where from 1679 to 1685 he was a chorister at the cathedral. Nothing is known of his parents. According to Hawkins, Bishop was a pupil of Daniel Roseingrave, but if so, it would have to have been during the period 1679&#150;81, when Roseingrave was organist of Gloucester and not, as Hawkins says, Salisbury, which latter post he held from 1692 to 1698.<br>
<br>In 1687 Bishop became a lay clerk at King's College, Cambridge, and, within a year, master of the choristers as well. In 1696 he was appointed organist of Winchester College in succession to Jeremiah Clarke, and, in June 1697, he also became a lay vicar at the cathedral. Some thirty years later, on 29 June 1729, he succeeded Vaughan Richardson as organist and master of the choristers, holding both posts, together with that at the college, until his death. Though he evidently faced a younger and better player (James Kent) in the competition for this latter appointment, it was, said Hayes, his &#145;age and amiable disposition&#146;, not to mention &#145;some misfortunes in his family&#146;, which &#145;inclined the Dean and Chapter to decide the contest wholly in his favour&#146;  (Hayes, v).<br>
<br>As a composer Bishop is of no great interest, and much of his music (almost entirely sacred) survives only in manuscript. His most substantial work, a service in D, is to be found complete only in Christ Church, Oxford, but there are copies of the morning canticles elsewhere. A <span class="italic">Sett of New Psalm Tunes</span> first printed in 1710 was clearly intended for parish use; reissued &#145;with variety of anthems&#146; in 1722 and again in 1730, it also has a 1725 supplement containing another twelve similar pieces. His Latin graces for the use of Winchester College were published by Hayes in 1780. His only instrumental music, a set of airs and sonatas for two flutes printed for the author in December 1700, does not survive. Bishop died in Winchester on 19 December 1737 and was buried on 22 December on the west side of the college cloister, where his memorial (transcribed by Hayes) speaks of an honest and upright life, his gentle manners, and faithful service over forty years.<br>
