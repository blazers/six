<span class="headword">Blackner,  John</span>  (1770?&#150;1816), <span class="occ">radical and county historian</span>, was born in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. He served an apprenticeship to a stocking maker in his native town, and there married Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown, sister of a &#145;respectable&#146; farmer in Kirk Hallam, Derbyshire, with whom he had four sons and three daughters. Illiterate at the time of his marriage, he taught himself to read and write soon after moving to Nottingham in 1792, where he found profitable work as a lace maker. He was of &#145;tall and commanding&#146; physique, had natural eloquence, and though mild in private conversation was boisterous, even overbearing, in public. He enjoyed society, and for a time lived a dissipated life of public houses and poaching. He emerged, though, as a leading voice among Nottingham's radical artisan community, publishing political pamphlets, notably <span class="italic">A Few Reflections on the Corn Laws</span> (1805), and from 1808 contributing regularly to the editorial comment of the <span class="italic">Nottingham Review</span>, which was unwavering in its opposition to the war with France. In 1810 Blackner was at the centre of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> when he was sentenced, with three others, to a month's imprisonment for conspiring to resist wage reductions in the lace trade. His close association with the framework-knitters' cause may thereafter have implicated him in Luddism. In July 1812 he was engaged as editor of <span class="italic">The Statesman</span>, a radical London evening paper, but he soon returned to Nottingham, apparently on account of failing health associated with heavy drinking. The following year he became landlord of a public house, which he renamed the Rancliffe Arms in honour of the town's radical MP Lord Rancliffe, whose candidacy in 1812 Blackner had helped bring about. In 1815 he published his substantial <span class="italic">History of Nottingham</span>, a valuable reference work and a contemporary record of the political controversies aroused by the French Revolution. Blackner was both a chronicler of and a participant in these disputes, firmly identifying with the &#145;democrat&#146; party against the &#145;aristocrat&#146;. For this partisanship his history has been criticized. Blackner was a radical patriot, who advocated the &#145;rights of man&#146; but defended government by the social &eacute;lite. A professed deist for much of his life, he turned to Christianity in his declining years, and died in Nottingham on 22 December 1816, survived by his wife.<br>
