<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stuart,  Gilbert Charles</span>  (1755&#150;1828), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 3 December 1755 near Saunderstown, Rhode Island, USA, the youngest of the three children of Gilbert Stewart, later Stuart (<i>c</i>.1718&#150;1793), inventor and snuff-mill operator, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1810), daughter of Albro Anthony. The artist's father, the son of a Presbyterian minister from Perth, was supposedly present at the battle of Culloden and it has been suggested that his emigration in the late 1740s was to avoid persecution. Stuart's maternal grandfather, of English descent, was a landowner and disciple of Bishop Berkeley. Stuart spent his youth in Newport as a charity scholar at the parochial school of Trinity Church, founded by Berkeley, where he received a liberal education. His aptitude for drawing caused him in 1769 to be taken on as an assistant and pupil of the Scottish portraitist Cosmo Alexander, then working in Newport, eventually sailing with him to Scotland <i>c</i>.1772. Alexander died shortly after their arrival and accounts differ as to whether Stuart then studied at the University of Glasgow; he was back in Newport by 1774, where he attempted to make a living painting portraits. Those that survive are stiff in manner. At some point after his return from Scotland Stuart saw the work of Copley, and realized that he needed to be in London in order to succeed as an artist. He arrived in London late in 1775 with little money and few prospects. By December 1776 Stuart was living on one meal a day and finally wrote for assistance to Benjamin West, who hired him to finish portraits and as a drapery painter for half a guinea a week.<br>
<br>Stuart's exposure to West's successful studio and practice caused his work to improve dramatically and he exhibited a portrait (now unidentified) in the Royal Academy exhibition of 1777. His work took on a new sophistication that owed as much to the work of George Romney and Gainsborough as it did to West's. Stuart remained &#145;wretchedly poor&#146; according to the painter John Trumbull  (Evans, 128, n. 19), but he exhibited portraits again at the Royal Academy in 1779. In 1781 he received published reviews for the first time and painted his celebrated portrait of William Grant ice skating (National Gallery of Art, Washington), which was extremely well received, both as a good likeness and as an inventive composition. Despite his success at the Royal Academy in 1782, Stuart exhibited at the Incorporated Society of Artists only in 1783, not at all in 1784, sent three pictures to the Royal Academy in 1785, and never exhibited again in Britain. John Boydell commissioned him to paint fifteen portraits of his associates, which included Reynolds (National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the engraver William Woollett (Tate collection), and which Boydell displayed in his gallery along with John Singleton Copley's <span class="italic">Death of Major Peirson</span>. Lord Percy, later second duke of Northumberland, who had served in America during the American War of Independence, commissioned at least three pictures from Stuart in 1783&#150;7 (all priv. coll.). Stuart gained a reputation for exceptional likenesses, in which he was aided by the use of life masks. Stuart moved to fashionable (and expensive) lodgings in New Burlington Street, London, in 1784. On 10 May 1786 he married Charlotte Coates (1767/8&#150;1845), with whom he had twelve children (one of whom published the first accounts of her father's life); they lived prodigally and Thomas Lawrence recalled that Stuart was imprisoned for debt. In 1787 Stuart moved to Dublin, accepting a commission from Charles Manners, fourth duke of Rutland, to paint his portrait as viceroy of Ireland. He returned to London at least twice but, having received several commissions in Ireland and considering his financial troubles in England, settled there. He was again imprisoned for debt in 1789, and in 1793 returned to what had become the United States.<br>
<br>Stuart worked in New York until early 1795, when he moved to the American capital, Philadelphia. In London he had received commissions from Americans as early as 1784, and on his repatriation he used these connections to obtain an introduction to George Washington, whom he painted for the first time early in 1795 (the &#145;Vaughan&#146; portrait; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC). A second sitting about March 1796 produced the unfinished &#145;Athenaeum&#146; portrait (National Portrait Gallery, Washington, DC, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) which, engraved in reverse, is the iconic image of Washington seen on the United States $1 bill. The Athenaeum portrait was the preparatory study for the full-length &#145;Lansdowne&#146; portrait, commissioned as a gift to William Petty, the first marquess of Lansdowne, and for which Washington sat one further time in April 1796 (National Portrait Gallery, Washington, DC). Stuart kept the Athenaeum portrait (and a similarly unfinished pendant of Mrs Washington) and used it as the model for over 100 autograph replicas.<br>
<br>Stuart always intended to return to London but his chronic insolvency meant that he could not raise the fare and he remained in the United States for the rest of his life. He followed the seat of government from Philadelphia to the new District of Columbia in 1803, and moved finally, in 1805, to Boston, where he lived at 101 Essex Street. Stuart painted most of the important figures of the early republic including much of Philadelphia and Boston society. His American-period portraits are flashier in execution than the subtle portraits of his London years, are of consistently high quality, and influenced portrait painting in America late into the nineteenth century. Throughout his life Stuart was known for his intelligence; he was well-read, cultured, and had a good sense of humour. However, in addition to gout and asthma, he suffered from fluctuations in mood and extended periods of lethargy and inactivity; a recent biographer suggested he displayed symptoms of manic depression  (Evans, 118). The left side of his face and part of his left arm were paralysed in 1825. He died on 9 July 1828 at his home in Boston, and was buried in the central burial-ground on Boston Common.<br>
