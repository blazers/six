<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seymour, Sir  Edward</span>, fourth baronet  (1633&#150;1708), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Edward Seymour, third baronet (1610&#150;1688), politician, of Berry Pomeroy in Devon, and Anne, daughter of Sir John Portman, first baronet. Seymour's father was the royalist governor of Dartmouth in 1643&#150;5 and a direct descendant of Edward Seymour, Protector Somerset. Little is known of Seymour's early life until he entered parliament in 1661 at a by-election for Hindon, close to the family's Wiltshire estate at Maiden Bradley. However, it may be assumed that the Seymours shared the privations of other sequestered royalists. Resentment at such early experiences, exacerbated by an almost pathological pride in ancestry, may have been responsible for the abrasiveness and arrogance that were features of Seymour's personality. Not even his family were spared. During the negotiations for his first marriage he quarrelled violently with his uncle Henry, causing his father to complain bitterly of Edward's &#145;pride and undutifulness&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 3.412). On 7 December 1661 he married Margaret, daughter and coheir of the London merchant Sir William Wale.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentaryapprentice"></a>Parliamentary apprentice</h2>Seymour took to the House of Commons like a duck to water, and was soon speaking regularly in support of the court. Sometimes his bold and aggressive style led him into indiscretion, and on one occasion he &#145;affronted the Speaker most peremptorily&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 3.413), but it was useful politically. Although he had served briefly as a gentleman of the privy chamber at the Restoration, his first significant office was as a subcommissioner for prizes in London during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. He also involved himself in various trading companies, in particular the Royal Fishing Company, and the Royal Adventurers into Africa. His aspirations were far from satisfied, however, and by 1665 he had shifted over to opposition. Two years later he was sufficiently prominent to be selected to open the debate on the earl of Clarendon's impeachment and to carry the impeachment up to the Lords.<br>
<br>By this time Seymour may be identified as a client of George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, and in this context should be read his arguments in favour of toleration in 1668, and his opposition in the following year to the <span class="roman">Conventicles Bill</span>, which he likened to the Spanish Inquisition. The parliamentary diarist John Milward observed cynically that in these speeches Seymour &#145;drives at an interest more than at religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Milward</span>, 221), and certainly this liberal interlude sits oddly with Seymour's cavalier background and later reputation as a staunch high-churchman. It may also be significant that he was not prepared to suffer long for these beliefs. A punitive dismissal from the commission of the peace served to concentrate his mind and in November 1670, allegedly on the advice of the duchess of York, he turned his coat: in Marvell's words, Seymour and others &#145;took their leave of their former party and fell to head the King's business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell</span>, ed. H. M. Margoliouth, 2 vols., 1952, 2.305).<h2>
<a name="Speakerofthehouse"></a>Speaker of the house</h2>As a ministerial spokesman in the Commons, Seymour proved a great success: busy, ingenious at procedural manipulation, a good manager, and forceful orator. By 1672 he had received a place on the Navy Board, and the following year he was considered as a potential candidate for the speakership. Although he had broken with Buckingham, shades of his former patron's influence may be detected in his vehement enmity towards France, and perhaps in his defence of the declaration of indulgence in parliament in 1673, although this latter intervention also did him no harm at court and may have helped his advance to the chair in February of that year. Seymour was in some respects an unusual choice as speaker, because of his lack of legal training (a deficiency of which he was acutely conscious himself), although on the credit side he had served as chairman of the important committees of supply and ways and means. As far as the court was concerned, he was an ideal choice. Bishop Burnet described him as:<blockquote>the most assuming Speaker that ever sat in the chair. He knew the House and every man in it so well that by looking about he could tell the fate of every question. So if anything was put when the court party were not well gathered together, he would have held the House from doing anything by wilful mistaking or mis-stating the question. (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.80)</blockquote>In April 1673 Seymour was sworn a privy councillor, and was then made treasurer of the navy, at a salary of &pound;3800. If rumour is to be believed, the money was badly needed; he is said to have told the king that were it not for the allowance of &pound;1500 per session he would not have been able to take the speakership.<br>
<br>Seymour soon became a <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of the opposition, and as early as the autumn of 1673 an attempt was made to remove him from the chair because, it was said, his frequent visits to brothels and gaming-houses lowered the reputation of parliament. On one occasion, old friendships were remembered: he was accused of partiality towards Buckingham when his former patron appeared before the Commons in January 1674. Otherwise he proved a strong speaker, unconstrained by constitutional niceties when a firm hand was required. His high-handedness and ignorance of the law exposed him to criticism; on the other hand, members seem to have appreciated that his powerful personality lent authority to the office. During the winter of 1677&#150;8 his arrogance led him into dangerous territory. Four times he adjourned the house by the king's command without putting the question, and in April 1678, to avoid a formal censure, he had to feign a diplomatic illness. When he eventually returned to the chair, however, he showed that he had lost none of his self-confidence, as his interventions strained the speaker's authority to new heights.<br>
<br>By this time Seymour's relations with Lord Treasurer Danby had deteriorated badly. The disclosure of the Popish Plot coincided with the final rupture. Even though in private Seymour did not believe in the veracity of the plot, he none the less acted as though he did, speaking strongly against popery and being the first to recommend limitations on a Catholic monarch. After the election of the first Exclusion Parliament in February 1679, to which he had been returned as knight of the shire for Devon, Seymour was in a difficult position, but his attacks on popery in the preceding session made him popular, despite the enmity which Lord Shaftesbury, his former ally in the Buckingham faction, entertained for him. Thus he was twice elected speaker against a court nominee, only for Charles II to reject him; and it was only in his absence that an alternative candidate was finally accepted by the Commons.<h2>
<a name="Courtandcountrypolitics"></a>Court and country politics</h2>Returned to the ranks of ordinary members, Seymour at first proceeded with caution, taking a moderate line on the plot. His popularity proved short-lived, the more so after he had voted against the first <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. However, this step restored him to favour at court, and especially with the duke of York. For someone as proud as Seymour of the part played by his family in promoting the Reformation in England, and with a long record of opposition to popery, it must have been galling to be accused of sympathy for the Catholic cause. Nevertheless, in November 1680, he made a powerful speech against the second <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, raising the spectre of another civil war which would entail the destruction of English liberties. So effective was his intervention that opposition members manufactured an impeachment against him for alleged malversation of naval funds. Seymour justified himself in a long speech in which he recalled the several occasions on which he had defended the privileges of the house, even resisting royal commands, and had refused a bribe. Such was the level of animosity against him that the motion for impeachment passed, only for the snap dissolution to put a stop to proceedings.<br>
<br>Seymour did not stand for election to the Oxford parliament but attended its meetings as a royal adviser. He was now at the brief zenith of his political power, directing appointments and dismissals (and prompting Dryden to write <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span>). His hauteur became unbearable, and when he quarrelled openly with Lord Halifax he finally overstepped the mark. He was removed from office, essentially on personal grounds although some historians have suggested, charitably, that his subsequent withdrawal from public affairs was also prompted by dislike of the shift in royal policy towards France, and a suspicion of Catholic influence at court. Whether or not it was of his own volition, he did not participate in the &#145;Stuart revenge&#146; of 1681&#150;5, and when he was returned to James II's parliament he denounced royal policy towards the boroughs, warned against the standing army and its Catholic officers, and even referred to the dangers of introducing the &#145;papist religion and unconstitutional government&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 3.418). His first wife having died, on 11 August 1685 Seymour married Letitia (<i>d</i>. 1729), daughter of Sir Francis Popham of Littlecote, Wiltshire. They had six sons and one daughter.<h2>
<a name="Williamitetory"></a>Williamite tory</h2>In 1687 Seymour was dismissed from his local offices, though remaining a privy councillor. He played no part in the opposition to James II in the country, but when the prince of Orange landed he responded quickly, joining William at Exeter, and drafting the local association in support of the Orangist cause and in defence of the protestant religion, the liberty of the subject, and the rule of law. His example was decisive in rallying west-country tories, and the prince made him governor of Exeter. But Seymour could not remain remote from the centre of events and hurried to London. He was especially concerned at the favour being shown to nonconformists, a revealing contrast to his previous public utterances, and further evidence, perhaps, that his political standpoint on religious questions was essentially opportunist. Certainly he was no exemplar of Anglican piety. But he was convinced that churchmen constituted &#145;the most considerable and most substantial body of the nation&#146;, and if the church were not supported &#145;we should run into a commonwealth and all would be ruined&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Henry Hyde</span>, 2.238). Thus reasons of principle, avoiding a recurrence of the upheavals of the 1640s, combined with an awareness of the political advantages to be gained by espousing the interest of the majority of the political nation, determined him to seek his following among tory squires. Moreover, despite the assistance he had given William, he found himself out of favour, possibly because of Danby's influence. Thus he voted in the Convention against the motion that the throne was vacant, and declared his unhappiness at the constitutional implications of the revolution, even if prepared to accept the new regime on pragmatic grounds. Tactlessly, he also gave vent to his natural dislike of the Dutch, in complaints at the behaviour of William's troops in the west country, and complained ceaselessly of mismanagements in the prosecution of the war. This oppositionist stance was continued into the 1690 parliament, in which Seymour appeared as one of the leading &#145;country tories&#146;, pressing inquiries into estimates and expenditure, and missing no opportunity to strike at his personal enemies, Danby and Halifax. With his former colleague from the &#145;country&#146; opposition in James II's parliament, Sir Christopher Musgrave, he developed a tory critique of the conduct of the war, as benefiting only the Dutch at England's expense, and argued for a greater concentration on naval operations. He also began to make overtures to discontented whigs, like Paul Foley and Robert Harley, in order to develop a combined &#145;country&#146; opposition.<br>
<br>At this point Seymour found himself badly in need of friends, of any political complexion: his accounts as treasurer of the navy remained unaudited, and he was also vulnerable because of incidental contacts with Jacobite conspirators like Lord Preston. So when he received overtures from a more sympathetic tory minister, Lord Nottingham, he responded positively (whether from fear of exposure or hope of gain), shifting around to a more moderate position. As a result, in the spring of 1692 he was reappointed to the privy council, from which he had been excluded in 1689, and was made a lord of the treasury. He then promptly reversed his former positions on a whole variety of issues&#151;accounts, expenditure, war strategy, naval administration&#151;though remaining consistent on one subject: trade, and in particular his involvement with the affairs of the East India Company. He was a close friend of the interloping merchant Thomas Coulson, whom he brought into parliament for the Devon borough of Totnes.<br>
<br>Seymour's identification with the court did not last long, for the rise to power of the whig junto made it necessary for him to rebuild former friendships and to restore his credit both with high-church back-benchers and &#145;country&#146; whigs. The crisis came in 1694 when his critical speeches on naval failures provoked the chancellor of the exchequer, Charles Montagu, to a savage response, which for once rendered Seymour speechless. Soon afterwards Seymour was dismissed from the treasury. In opposition once more, he did not find it easy to re-establish his former position. Younger men like Foley and Harley were coming to the fore. Seymour's integrity had been compromised by his several voltes-face, and more harm was to come to his reputation as his misplaced confidence as an oracle of parliamentary procedure drew him into blunders, and investigations into parliamentary corruption over East Indian affairs threatened to implicate him. He even lost his seat at Exeter in 1695 and was obliged to fall back on the less &#145;popular&#146; constituency of Totnes.<h2>
<a name="Highchurchchampion"></a>High-church champion</h2>Seymour's response to these setbacks was to re-emphasize his own tory credentials, opposing the association of 1696 and the attainder of the Jacobite Sir John Fenwick, and exploiting tory xenophobia by further attacks on the Dutch and on Huguenot refugees. His aversion to government was completed by the foundation of the new East India Company in 1697, which left his own connections out in the cold, and he identified firmly with the old company in its struggle to recover its position. At the same time he was also emphasizing his Devonian roots, showing himself to be a strenuous advocate of local commercial and manufacturing interests. He promoted bills to restrict the export of Irish woollen goods, to benefit the Devon and Somerset cloth industries. His intention was to establish himself as the leader of the high tories in the Commons, with a strong local power base. So while Harley and Foley made the running in the &#145;new country party&#146; opposition, Seymour settled into a subordinate position at the head of a &#145;western empire&#146; of tories.<br>
<br>The limits to Seymour's parliamentary influence were clearly seen in 1698, when his vanity persuaded him to stand once again for the speakership, only to be disappointed. He recovered some ground through the virulence of his attacks on the junto ministers, especially over corruption (a charge from which he was himself not entirely safe). But it was Harley rather than Seymour to whom the king turned in the winter of 1700&#150;01 to manage the Commons for the new tory ministry. Although due deference was paid to Seymour he was given no office, and in the 1701 parliament inevitably became restive. Denouncing the old ministry by exposing the secret partition treaty reinforced his position as a tory hero, but embarrassed the king. Indeed, Seymour overplayed his hand to such an extent that, despite his support for the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span>, and for a generous settlement of the civil list, William not only refused to restore him to office but turned against the tories as a party.<h2>
<a name="Lastcampaigns"></a>Last campaigns</h2>It was only after the accession of Queen Anne that Seymour was restored to power, as comptroller of the household in the Godolphin&#150;Marlborough administration. However, his self-appointed role as leader of the tory interest in the Commons now determined his political stance and he was much less flexible in old age than he had been even in the early 1690s. He never entirely accepted the strategic imperatives imposed by Marlborough, hankering after a &#145;blue-water&#146; policy of naval rather than land warfare. Worse still, he indulged himself in a display of the full spectrum of tory prejudices, ranting against foreign army officers, union with Scotland, and especially the practice of occasional conformity by which dissenters evaded the requirements of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>. The dismissal of Lord Rochester in 1703, and the consequent reconstruction of the ministry, left Seymour and Nottingham isolated, and when Nottingham departed in 1704 Seymour inevitably followed.<br>
<br>Dismissal from office signalled the end of Seymour's political career. He began to admit the weaknesses of age, and talk of handing the torch to younger men. Reports of decrepitude were briefly disproved at the beginning of the 1705 parliament when he made a number of vigorous speeches, but by late 1706 he had convinced himself, and his physician, that he was dying. Ironically, it was at this point he finally succeeded in clearing his debts as treasurer of the navy. In the event, he survived until 18 February 1708, when he died at Maiden Bradley. He was buried at Maiden Bradley.<br>
<br>Of Seymour's two sons from his first marriage, the elder, Edward, succeeded him in the baronetcy; the younger, William, enjoyed a military career. The eldest son of Seymour's second marriage, Popham Seymour-Conway, succeeded to the considerable estates of his mother's cousin the earl of Conway, in Ireland and England, but was killed in a duel in 1699, so the fortune passed to the next brother, Francis, who assumed the name Conway and was created Baron Conway in 1703. He was the father of the first marquess of Hertford.<br>
