<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pearsall,  William Harold</span>  (1891&#150;1964), <span class="occ">ecologist and botanist</span>, was born at Stourbridge, Worcestershire, on 23 July 1891, the only son and second of the three children of William Harrison Pearsall, schoolmaster and Methodist lay preacher, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Green, of Earl Shilton, Leicester. The family moved to Dalton in Furness when Pearsall was quite young; his father had been appointed headmaster of Broughton Road School in that town. Pearsall attended his father's school until 1905 and then went to Ulverston grammar school. In 1909 he was admitted to the University of Manchester to read chemistry. However, after his first year he changed to botany, graduating with first-class honours in 1913. From his earliest days he had accompanied his father, a keen amateur naturalist with whom he later co-authored several scientific papers, on frequent excursions into the Lake District, where they had searched for water plants using a home-made boat launched dredger. A university graduate scholarship enabled him to devote himself to a systematic study of the distribution of aquatic plants in the English lakes. He was awarded his MSc in 1915 and in the following year he joined the Royal Garrison Artillery and saw active service in France, returning to civilian life in 1919 with troublesome hearing loss.<br>
<br>During the war, in 1917, Pearsall married Marjory Stewart, second child of Robert Peter George Williamson, director of education, of Stoke-on-Trent. She was herself a first-class honours graduate in botany of Manchester, where she was a fellow student of Pearsall's, and later lecturer in botany at Birmingham and then at Leeds. There were two sons, Alan William Halliday Pearsall (1925&#150;2006), naval historian, and Ian Stewart Pearsall (1928&#150;1982), engineer.<br>
<br>In 1919 Pearsall became an assistant lecturer under Professor J. H. Priestley at Leeds University. In the following year he was promoted to a full lectureship and was awarded a DSc by Manchester University for his researches on the English lakes. In 1922 he was made reader in botany at Leeds and in 1938 he was appointed professor of botany at Sheffield University. He was elected FRS in 1940 and in 1944 succeeded E. J. Salisbury in the Quain chair of botany at University College, London, retaining it until his retirement in 1957. He was well regarded at University College for both his teaching and his administrative flair, and many of his students acquired from his field excursions a lasting interest in the countryside.<br>
<br>Pearsall's earliest scientific publications (1917&#150;21) related to his postgraduate studies of lakes and their vegetation. Consideration of the mode of erosion of wave exposed shores, and of the redeposition of the removed material, enabled him to explain the distribution of plant communities in and around Esthwaite Water. The shore vegetation at the north end of the lake was of special interest because it changed with distance from the mouth of the inflow stream which carried most of the incoming silt. Pearsall carefully mapped the plant communities, showing their relation to the water margin and to the fineness and chemical content of the accumulating sediments. When he remapped the area in 1929 all the zones had advanced into or towards the open water. The general interest aroused by this direct demonstration of plant succession led to the declaration of the North Fen as a national nature reserve in 1954 and to a further mapping in 1967&#150;9 by a group from Lancaster University.<br>
<br>Pearsall next looked at the lakes as a whole in an attempt to account for differences between them. Since all occupy ice deepened rock basins which became ice free at much the same time, he argued that their present differences must have arisen from differing rates of subsequent change. The rocky lakes like Wastwater and Ennerdale must be relatively primitive, the much silted lakes like Windermere and Esthwaite must therefore be more advanced. The rocky lakes have very clear water, poor in dissolved substances, scanty vegetation, and trout as the most abundant fish. The silted lakes have water less clear but richer in plant nutrients, much more vegetation, and perch, pike, and eels as the typical fish. The publication in 1921 reporting these findings is typical of both the boldness of Pearsall's inferences from a large body of fieldwork and the simplicity of his resulting synthesis. Pearsall's work stimulated much further research, but doubts arose later when the analysis of deep lake sediments showed that there had in fact been great variations in rates of change and some reversals of direction. However, these ultimately proved explicable in the light of ideas largely suggested by Pearsall himself, resulting in a less simple, but more ecologically interesting, story.<br>
<br>From 1937 Pearsall's research included work on the ecological significance of the electric potentials of natural soils, which he interpreted as oxidation-reduction potentials. There were further valuable contributions on soils and studies on bogs. In his presidential address to section K of the British Association in 1954 he drew attention to the increasingly urgent problems of world food production. There followed a series of papers by himself and former pupils on production ecology which undoubtedly influenced the choice of biological productivity as one of two major topics for the International Biological Programme.<br>
<br>In 1950 Pearsall published <span class="italic">Mountains and Moorlands</span>, a work in which he drew on all his vast knowledge of Britain's highland zone and on his capacity for creative imagination and lucid writing. Although written primarily for the amateur naturalist, it nevertheless provided the university student with an unrivalled introduction to the scientific analysis of familiar ecological phenomena. His <span class="italic">Report on an Ecological Survey of Serengeti National Park, Tanganyika</span> (1956) was a classic of ecological literature.<br>
<br>Pearsall was one of three biologists principally involved in seeking to establish a British centre for lake research, efforts which led to the foundation of the Freshwater Biological Association in 1929. Pearsall was closely involved from the start in the development of the association's research, playing a very active role in guiding, encouraging, and inspiring the research workers until the end of his life.<br>
<br>Pearsall joined the British Ecological Society soon after its foundation and began his term as president in 1936. From 1937 to 1947 he edited the society's <span class="italic">Journal of Ecology</span>. His presidential address on &#145;The soil complex in relation to plant communities&#146; was one of his most lauded achievements. He was editor of <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> from 1948 to 1961 and at the time of his death he was secretary of the Annals of Botany Company. He had a vision of the need for the conservation of nature long before it became fashionable and, with other prominent naturalists, played an important part in the creation of the Nature Conservancy, which was established in 1949, becoming a charter member. He was chairman of its scientific policy committee from 1953 to 1963. This enabled him to exert a powerful influence for the application of critical scientific thought to problems of nature conservation.<br>
<br>A number of academic and other honours came to Pearsall. He was honorary DSc of Durham (1958) and Birmingham (1963) universities and received the Linnean Society's gold medal for botany in 1963. He was made an honorary member of the British Ecological Society and the Society for Experimental Biology, and a foreign member of the Swedish Phytogeographical Society. He was a fellow of the Institute of Biology and its president in 1957&#150;8.<br>
<br>Pearsall was of tall and slender but athletic build and, with a small close clipped moustache, had something of the military in his aspect. He was blue eyed, with fair hair and a pale skin. He always appeared vigorous and purposeful, most so, perhaps, when he was striding with obvious enjoyment across a moor or up a mountain, his companions trailing behind him. Those who met him for the first time were at once impressed by his wide knowledge and capacity for penetrating analysis, but they soon discovered his modesty and humanity and an endearing gaiety of spirit. He enjoyed fly-fishing, drawing in pen and ink or watercolour, and golf.<br>
<br>Pearsall died at the Victoria Hospital, Morecambe and Heysham, on 14 October 1964 of a brain tumour. His wife and sons survived him.<br>
