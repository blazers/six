<span class="headword">Evans,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1652&#150;1724), <span class="occ">East India Company chaplain and Church of Ireland bishop of Meath</span>, was born into a Welsh-speaking family at Plas-du, Llanarmon, Caernarvonshire. Although the precise details of his parentage and early life remain obscure, it seems most likely that he was the son of Ynyr Evans of Plas-du, and that he was the John, son of Bonner (an Anglicization of ab Ynyr or Bynyr), who matriculated at Gloucester Hall, Oxford, in 1668 (when his age was given as sixteen), but left the university without taking a degree.<br>
<br>After ordination Evans served as a curate at St Magnus the Martyr, Thames Street, London, and then at Isleworth in Middlesex, where he came to the attention of Sir Joseph Ashe, first baronet, governor of the East India Company. Through Ashe's recommendation Evans was appointed in 1678 as the company's first chaplain in India, at &pound;100 a year. On 13 February 1679 he married Elizabeth Trenchfield, sister of the interloping merchant Richard Trenchfield, and himself became drawn into the interloping trade. He thus attracted the unwelcome attentions of William Hedges, the agent sent out by the company in 1682, who reported that Evans &#145;busies himself too much in trade and merchandise for a man of his coat, being certainly one of the greatest traders in Hugli&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of William Hedges</span>, 1.140). Furthermore, Evans was regarded by those who had business dealings with him as a &#145;great knave&#146;  (ibid.). In consequence, Evans lost the trust of the company directors, who disparaged him as &#145;the quondam minister but late great merchant&#146;, and as the &#145;politic padre&#146;  (ibid.), and he was eventually dismissed from the chaplaincy in 1692. He made his own way back to England, took his bachelor's and doctor's degrees in divinity at Oxford in 1695, and secured a parish in his native county, though whether his advancement was the product of political influence or a tribute to the power of his money is unclear. He was certainly wealthy enough from his trading days to maintain a residence in Bloomsbury, Middlesex (which suggests that he may well have been an absentee rector), and he kept up his contacts with East India merchants.<br>
<br>In 1699 Evans was said to be actively soliciting the likely vacancy in the bishopric of St David's, and in 1701 he succeeded in obtaining Bangor. A staunch whig, Evans soon showed his party colours in convocation, where in 1702 he caused a minor furore by accusing the leading high churchman Francis Atterbury of lying, in return for which Atterbury's high-church friends maliciously questioned the legitimacy of Evans's own summons. In the Lords he was a reliable junto whig and he regularly subscribed to partisan protests. He was also a founder member of the Most Honourable and Loyal Society of Ancient Britons, the first Welsh club to be established in London, which had a strong party-political bias. His active involvement in the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and in the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel is evidence that he was more than a political prelate, but it was undoubtedly his whiggism that earned him translation to the lucrative Irish see of Meath in 1716, at a time when he supposedly had his pick of several vacancies. In Ireland as in England Evans did not flinch from political controversy; he became a prominent spokesman for the English interest in the Irish House of Lords, in particular over the issue of the appellate jurisdiction of the house.<br>
<br>Evans's correspondence with William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, reveals him to be not only a man of firm principles and unquenchable loyalty to administration, but one of passionate temper. Evans felt keenly his political isolation in Ireland, where he and a coterie of like-minded bishops, including his old friend William Nicolson of Derry, took prime responsibility for the defence of the ministry's position in parliament, and his often querulous commentary on the intrigues of his &#145;patriot&#146; opponents, imputing to them the most extreme views (extending as far as the contemplation of armed rebellion in support of Irish legislative independence), sometimes suggests an imbalance in his own psychology. He carried his political vendettas over into ecclesiastical affairs, especially in his quarrel with Jonathan Swift, who held a living in Evans's diocese. At an episcopal visitation in 1718 words passed between the two men which resulted in Swift reminding his bishop that he was speaking to a clergyman and not a footman. When Swift did not attend subsequent visitations Evans petulantly refused to accept his proxy. Swift's letters of self-justification included the memorable reproof: &#145;I am only sorry that you, who are of a country famed for good nature, have found a way to unite the hasty passion of your own countrymen, with the long, sedate resentment of the Spaniard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 2.388&#150;90). At the same time, however, Evans showed himself to be a determined opponent of clerical absenteeism (which again involved him in conflicts with Swift), and a surprisingly disinterested steward of the material interests of the church. His energetic pursuit of a legal case against an influential tenant, Henry St George, for the renegotiation of an over-indulgent lease eventually provoked Irish MPs to introduce a bill to preserve the rights of tenants at the expense of the church, which the bishop duly opposed in the Lords.<br>
<br>Evans died suddenly in Dublin on 2 March 1724, after having been &#145;afflicted with a violent fit of the gout about ten days&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 6116, fol. 132), and was buried in the churchyard of &#145;Little St George's&#146; Chapel in Temple Street in Dublin. His wife evidently outlived him, but there is no mention in contemporary correspondence of any surviving children, although at least one son (John) had been born in India. In his will, described by Swift as the &#145;wise&#146; act of a &#145;fool&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.11), he bequeathed &pound;1000 for the building of an episcopal palace at Ardbraccan in co. Meath (which was completed only in 1776), a much smaller sum of money to endow his first rectory in Caernarvonshire, and the residue of his personal estate for the benefit of poorer clergy in England and the churches of his Irish diocese.<br>
