<span class="headword">Percy, Sir  Ralph</span>  (1425&#150;1464), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son (probably the seventh) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21933/', "Henry Percy, second earl of Northumberland (1394&#150;1455)")</script>, and Eleanor (<i>d</i>. after 1465), widow of Richard Despenser, styled Lord Despenser, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19951/', "Ralph Neville, first earl of Westmorland")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53026/', "Joan Beaufort")</script>. He was born on 11 August 1425 at Leconfield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He spent his life in support of his family and of the house of Lancaster. He was active on commissions in Northumberland, being on the commissions of the peace there in 1447, 1455, and 1460, and on various other commissions in the 1440s and 1450s, including the commission of array in December 1459. He was knighted between July 1448 and April 1449, and was steward of his father's court in Northumberland in 1450. He took a leading part with his brothers in the rivalry between the Nevilles and Percys and was commanded with his eldest brother, Lord Poynings, to appear before the king's council in May 1454 to answer for his part in disturbances in Yorkshire (although this letter was never sent:  (<span class="italic">Proceedings &hellip; of the Privy Council</span>, 6.179)). With his brother Richard he pledged himself in the sum of 2000 marks for offences against the duke of York and his associates in March 1458. Before this he fought at the first battle of St Albans in May 1455. He also fought at the battle of Wakefield and was afterwards named as one of those responsible for the death of the duke of York.<br>
<br>Sir Ralph married, before about 1452, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. after 1498), daughter of Lawrence Acton, of Acton, Northumberland, and his wife, Matilda. They had three sons, Sir Henry (<i>d</i>. 1486), Sir Ralph (<i>d</i>. after 1489), and George (<i>d</i>. 1500), and probably one daughter, Margaret.<br>
<br>In 1457 Percy was appointed constable of the castle of Dunstanburgh, although he had apparently been living there as deputy constable, possibly from 1451, and the last few years of his life were spent in and around the castles on the north-east coast. He does not appear to have fought at the battle of Towton, since he was not attainted afterwards. He surrendered Dunstanburgh at Michaelmas 1461 and was allowed to hold it for Edward IV. In October 1462, however, when Margaret of Anjou landed with a small army on the north-east coast, Sir Ralph Percy surrendered Dunstanburgh to her and with others was placed by her in command of Bamburgh Castle. By December, Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh were under siege by the earl of Warwick and on 27 December, Percy reversed his loyalties again and surrendered on condition that if he swore allegiance to Edward IV, he would be given back command of Bamburgh, as was done. To show his trust, on 17 March, Edward further granted Percy authority to receive unattainted repentant rebels into the king's grace, at Percy's discretion. At about the same time Percy reversed his allegiance for the last time and allowed the Scottish and French supporters of Margaret of Anjou to occupy the two castles of Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh.<br>
<br>By December 1463 Percy had been joined in Bamburgh by the duke of Somerset and Henry VI. In the early months of 1464 Percy and Somerset were raiding in Northumberland and further afield and, having learnt that Lord Montagu, with a small force, was travelling to the Scottish border to escort Scottish ambassadors, attempted to intercept him. Montagu was warned in time to avoid ambush but was attacked at Hedgeley Moor by Percy and his forces on or about 25 April 1464. Percy's force was routed and he himself killed. Traditionally, as he lay dying he cried out that he had &#145;saved the bird in his bosom&#146;  (Hall, 260), said to mean that he had kept his oath to Henry VI&#151;a rather strange meaning if true, given his disloyalty to both sides. A column called Percy's Cross still stands on the traditional spot where Sir Ralph fell. He was attainted in parliament in 1465.<br>
