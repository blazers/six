<span class="headword">Cobbold <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Knipe; <em>other married name </em>Clarke]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1765&#150;1824), <span class="occ">poet and artist in cut paper</span>, was born on 11 February 1765 and baptized at St Olave, Silver Street, London, on 6 March 1765. Her parents, Robert Knipe (<i>c</i>.1731&#150;1801) and Alice Waller (<i>c</i>.1737&#150;1797), were married at St Lawrence Jewry on 20 April 1758. In 1783 the family was in Manchester and Elizabeth's first collection of poetry was published there. She met Sir Joshua Reynolds in a London bookshop and dedicated her third work, <span class="italic">Six Narrative Poems</span>, to him in 1787; four years later, when her fourth work appeared, the Knipes were at Liverpool and there Elizabeth married William Clarke (<i>bap</i>. 1731, <i>d</i>. 1791) at St Ann's Church on 16 November 1790. Clarke, an ailing sixty year old, was comptroller of customs at Ipswich, a portman who had been five times bailiff (joint mayor) there. Elizabeth was new to Ipswich and had only three months to taste the nonconformist and whig world that her husband inhabited before he died on 28 February 1791. She had less than six months to adapt to the idea of marrying again on 7 August 1791, but there was time that year for a two-volume novel, <span class="italic">The Sword</span> by Eliza Clarke, to be published in Liverpool. Her second husband, John Cobbold (1746&#150;1835), was a prosperous Ipswich brewer and banker, a pillar of the established church and the blue party and only twenty years her senior. Elizabeth was the ideal person to take on his fifteen children aged under seventeen from a first marriage and they had six more sons and a daughter over the next ten years. Her hands were too full for much writing, but for Ann Candler's benefit, she did edit <span class="italic">Poetical Attempts</span>, with a memoir, in 1803. Recognizing a rare vocal talent, she encouraged the Ipswich girl Mary Ann Goward, later Mrs Robert Keeley, to a successful stage career. She corresponded with the Bonapartist Capel Lofft and with Sir J. E. Smith PLS over his <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span>; George Sowerby the elder named a &#145;rare, and withal, elegant shell&#146;  (G. Sowerby, <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology</span>, 2.177, pl. 180) from the cragpits of the Suffolk coast <span class="italic">Nucula Cobboldiae</span>.<br>
<br>The Cobbolds moved from the Manor House on St Margaret's Green in Ipswich (where Margaret Catchpole served them) to Cliff House beside the brewery on the Orwell by 1798, then in 1814 to Holywells, newly built in the park whose healing springs fed the brewery below. At all their homes Elizabeth and the family entertained a wide circle of friends, generally including officers from the garrison&#151;especially the King's German Legion commanded by her friend Count Linsingen&#151;with genuine warmth and generosity. She wrote several dramatic pieces for the children (and even the officers) to perform, but none was published. An engaging speaker, Elizabeth founded, presided over, and raised funds for her Ipswich charities: the lying-in charity, the Society for Clothing the Infant Poor, and the annual charity bazaar.<br>
<br>From 1806 the highlight of each year at Cliff House was the valentine party for which Cobbold employed her greatest skill in advance: designing and making up to eighty scissors-cut valentines to present to each of the unmarried guests and mounting them with an appropriate poem on red or blue paper. By folding the paper first she could make two or three copies at once; one always went into albums for eventual presentation to her own children. There is a collection of thirty-six of her designs from 1811 in the Suffolk Record Office, and the recently discovered albums that she made for her sons Robert Knipe and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5738/', "Richard Cobbold")</script>, each containing over a hundred examples, display great dexterity and originality.<br>
<br>The valentine parties ran until 1822 when Elizabeth Cobbold was prevented by illness from holding one as usual, and two years later she was struck down by &#145;an alarming illness&#146; in July, which, returning in October, rendered her unconscious for the week before she died on 17 October 1824. She was interred six days later in the Cobbold vault in St Clement's Church, but subscribers paid for an imposing mural monument in the civic church, St Mary le Tower, as &#145;a public testimony of respect for exalted talents and unwearied exertion in the cause of benevolence and charity&#146;. Her <span class="italic">Cliff Valentines</span> (poems only) for 1813 and 1814 were published in those years, and her &#145;Ode to Waterloo&#146; in 1815. A memoir by Laetitia Jermyn (later the wife of James Ford) prefaces the posthumously collected <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1825), which includes many unpublished pieces, to which members of the family added poorly etched reproductions of some of her cuts. Her prolific writings, often witty and generally addressed to a friend on a particular occasion, illuminate the provincial social scene in which she was such a genial and romantic influence. Much of her verse stoops to doggerel, only inappropriate when she attempted epic subjects. Her son Richard, curate to his uncle Thomas Cobbold at the Tower church, continued to organize exhibitions of his mother's valentines as well as public dinners and balls to raise funds for her charities; his own illustrated <span class="italic">Valentine Verses</span> (1827) was published to promote the work further. Elizabeth's portrait conveys a comfortable, lovable personality; posthumous tributes praised her very diverse skills, but it is only the productions of her scissors that have enduring merit.<br>
