<span class="headword">Pye,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1609/10), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Darlaston near Wednesbury in Staffordshire. According to Anthony Wood, Pye was &#145;educated for the most part in logicals and philosophicals in Merton college, [Oxford], of which he became one of the chaplains in 1581, being then esteemed among the learned to be one of them&#146;; he graduated BTh on 21 June 1585, winning a reputation as &#145;an eminent linguist, excellent in sacred chronology, in ecclesiastical histories and polemical divinity&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 59). He translated as <span class="italic">Solomons Sermon</span> (1586) a work by the catechist Antonio del Corro, whom he praised highly.<br>
<br>From 1577 until 1589 Pye was rector of Newton Toney in Wiltshire, from where evidence emerged of his sympathy with puritan positions; in 1584&#150;5 it was reported that he did not wear a surplice and refused to baptize with the sign of the cross. In 1586 he was instituted as rector of Earnley-with-Almodington, Sussex. On 5 December 1587 he was collated to the prebend of Selsey in the diocese of Chichester. About 1590 he became vicar and schoolmaster of Bexhill near Hastings in Sussex. For many years during his mastership, Pye was also rector of nearby Brightling, from where he reported in 1603, that &#145;there is no man or woman recusant or backwards in religion and there is none that doth not receive the communion orderly&#146;  (<span class="italic">VCH Sussex</span>, 9.228). Pye was sufficiently reconciled to the establishment to preface his book <span class="italic">An Hourglasse Containing a Computation from the Beginning of Time to Christ by X Articles</span> (1597) to Archbishop Whitgift, but advised the primate of his alarm at the prospects for godly protestantism, during the &#145;very dogdaies of the church and religion, which now lie together in a desperate paroxism and most dangerous fitte, jointly shaken and assaulted by popery and atheism&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1602&#150;3 Pye became engaged in a controversy with Bishop John Howson of Oxford. Pye thought it lawful for a man to divorce an adulterous wife, and then to remarry, and in January 1603 he signed <span class="italic">Epistola ad ornatissimum virum D. Johannem Housonum</span>, a short refutation of theses on such matters which Howson had published the previous year. Pye also prepared a much fuller statement of his position and sent it to John Rainolds, president of Corpus Christi College, who in 1597 had set down similar views on the issue (issued posthumously in 1609). Rainolds replied that he liked Pye's work and wished it could be published, but pointed out that when he had sought permission to publish his own views on the same subject, Archbishop Whitgift had given his opinion that this was inappropriate owing to the dangerous freedoms they encouraged. Rainolds counselled against Pye's explicit defence of his 1597 views, and advised against the violence of some of his strictures against Howson. He proffered detailed and sympathetic suggestions for toning down the book for publication. Whether or not Pye took the advice, his work was refused a licence. A Latin account of the controversy appears, with Rainolds's letter appended, in <span class="italic">Uxore dissmissa &hellip; tertia thesis Johannis Howsoni</span> (1606).<br>
<br>In 1606, when Pye returned to Darlaston to visit his family, &#145;some of his servants went to ring in the old steeple, which was of wood, and much decayed, so that their lives were in danger&#146;; Pye therefore &#145;proffered the town, that in case they would be at the charge of bringing stone, he would find workmanship, and build them a tower, which accordingly he did&#146;  (Plot, 297). On the outside of the tower an inscription was cut&#151;&#145;Pietati et Priis. Vive pius, et moriere pius&#146;&#151;a pun on the benefactor's name, which may be translated &#145;By piety and pious deeds, Pious live and pious die&#146;. Pye died three years later at Bexhill. In his will dated 20 December 1609 he desired that his body might be buried in the schoolhouse at Bexhill, which he had recently had repaired and repaved. He mentioned three sons, Nicholas, George, and Hennege, all under age, and a brother, Richard Pye of Porlaston, Staffordshire. The inclusion of Sir Nicholas Parker and Thomas Pelham esquire among his overseers hints at his patrons. The will was proved by his widow and executor, Ellynor or Elianore (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hennege?) on 20 March 1610.<br>
