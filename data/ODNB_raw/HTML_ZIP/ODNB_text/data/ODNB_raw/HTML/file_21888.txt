<span class="headword">Penrose, Sir  Charles Vinicombe</span>  (1759&#150;1830), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in the parish of St Gluvias near Penryn on 20 June 1759, the youngest of seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70345/', "John Penrose (1713&#150;1776)")</script>, vicar of St Gluvias and letter writer, and his wife, Elizabeth (1718&#150;1782), daughter of the Revd John Vinicombe. In February 1772 he was admitted to the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth, and, after the full course of three years, he joined the frigate <i>Levant</i> (Captain the Hon. George Murray), in which he served for four years in the Mediterranean. In August 1779 he was promoted lieutenant and in November he joined the frigate <i>Cleopatra</i>, again under Murray. The vessel served in the North Sea for the remainder of the war, Penrose, by then her first lieutenant, suffering severely from hypothermia during the winter of 1780&#150;81. He participated in the action off the Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781, and afterwards wrote a critical account of Sir Hyde Parker's conduct.<br>
<br>In January 1783 the <i>Cleopatra</i> was paid off and for the next seven years Penrose was ashore. Nevertheless he rejected an offer by some of the burgesses of Penryn to use their political influence to secure him promotion provided he became a voter in the borough. On 2 January 1787 he married Elizabeth Trevenen (1749/50&#150;1832); the couple had three daughters, and during their early married life lived at Breage, near Helston. Penrose's refusal to advance his career through politics meant that he was still a lieutenant in 1790 when, again under Murray, he served in the <i>Defence</i> during the Spanish armament. In 1793 he joined the <i>Duke</i>, serving under Murray at the capture of Martinique in June, and later he followed his captain into the <i>Glory</i> and then the <i>Resolution</i>. In April 1794 Murray was promoted rear-admiral and given command of the North American station: Penrose too was promoted and followed his patron as commander of the <i>Lynx</i>. Further advancement was quickly forthcoming when he was posted into the <i>Cleopatra</i> in October; and he was briefly Murray's flag-captain in the <i>Resolution</i> in 1795 before returning to the <i>Cleopatra</i> the following year. Penrose returned home with Murray in June 1796 after the admiral had suffered a stroke. After extensive repairs the <i>Cleopatra</i> then served in the channel, though ill health obliged Penrose to leave her in July 1797. From 1799 he once again served in the West Indies, successively in the <i>Sans Pareil</i> and the <i>Carnatic</i>, before coming home with sunstroke in July 1802.<br>
<br>Between 1804 and 1810 Penrose commanded the sea-fencibles in the Padstow district. He was then appointed commodore for port duties at Gibraltar; in that responsible position he played an important role in helping Spanish forces fighting the French and also in the defence of Tarifa. In January 1813 his health again forced him home but he was able to participate in a small commission revising the establishment of stores in Plymouth Dockyard. On 4 December he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral and placed in command of a small squadron operating off northern Spain and south-western France. This force distinguished itself in constructing a bridge across the Adour River in February 1814 and by clearing the Gironde of all French warships during March and April.<br>
<br>Upon Penrose's return to Plymouth in the autumn he was made commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, this lasting until May 1815 when Lord Exmouth, the fleet's former commander, resumed his position. Penrose remained as his second until again becoming overall commander when Exmouth went home in May 1816. In August Penrose was furious to learn of the expedition against Algiers, about which the Admiralty had sent him no word and of which he heard only by chance. He was even angrier to discover that a junior admiral, a stranger to the station, had been made the expedition's second-in-command. Exmouth was able to soothe Penrose's understandably hurt feelings and to persuade him to handle the concluding negotiations with the dey of Algiers. After this he resumed his sole command in the Mediterranean until returning home in 1819. On 19 July 1821 he was advanced to the rank of vice-admiral, having been made a KCB on 3 January 1816 and a KGCMG on 27 April 1818; he saw no further service.<br>
<br>Penrose retired to his home at Ethy, near Lostwithiel. Between 1804 and 1810 he had contributed to the <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span> under the signatures A. F. Y. and E. F. G., and also to an account of Cornish agriculture published in 1811. He later wrote some pamphlets on naval matters and penned a memoir of his brother-in-law, Captain James Trevenen of the Russian navy, which was published by his nephew, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21891/', "Revd John Penrose")</script>. Charles Penrose died at Ethy, probably of a stroke, on 1 January 1830, and was buried in the churchyard at St Winnow. He was survived by his wife, who died on 3 April 1832.<br>
