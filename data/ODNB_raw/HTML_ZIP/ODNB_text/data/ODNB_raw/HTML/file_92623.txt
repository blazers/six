<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brymer,  John Alexander <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1915&#150;2003), <span class="occ">clarinettist</span>, was born on 27 January 1915 at 92 South Woodbine Street, South Shields, co. Durham, son of John Alexander Brymer, builder, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dixon. An autodidact, he became interested in the clarinet at the age of four, after finding one of his father's old instruments lying around the house. With his father's music-making in his ears, he progressed quickly and played with a military band when he was eleven. While still at South Shields grammar school he came under the spell of the oboist Leon Goossens, whose approach to vibrato later influenced his clarinet sound. In 1933 he moved south and enrolled as a trainee teacher at Goldsmiths' College, University of London. There he met his future wife, Joan Richardson, a violinist and viola player, also training to be a teacher. She was the daughter of John Richardson. They married at the parish church of St Andrew, Eastbourne, on 21 October 1939, when both were aged twenty-four. They had one son, Timothy.<br>
<br>At Goldsmiths' College Brymer developed as an orchestral player by joining the Goldsmiths' Evening Institute Orchestra and the Ernest Read Symphony Orchestra. But he did not intend to pursue a career in music at that time, and accepted a post as a schoolmaster at Heath Clark School, Croydon, in 1935. Although he taught general subjects, he specialized in music and continued to be active as an amateur musician. In later life he argued that no musician was completely self-taught and recalled that he supplemented his knowledge of the art by attending performances of leading clarinettists, including Charles Draper, Haydn Draper, Frederick Thurston, and Reginald Kell. After Heath Clark School was evacuated to Eastbourne at the beginning of the war, and later to Llanelli, Brymer joined the Royal Air Force in 1940. On completing his basic training at Uxbridge he was deployed to Morecambe as a physical training instructor with the rank of corporal. At Morecambe he continued to pursue his interest in music and could be seen playing in the Morecambe Central Pier dance band dressed in his RAF uniform.<br>
<br>After demobilization Brymer returned to teaching at Croydon in 1945. But during his time in the RAF he had met the horn-player Dennis Brain, who recommended him to Sir Thomas Beecham as a possible replacement for Reginald Kell as principal clarinettist of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Beecham acted on Brain's suggestion and, in July 1947, unexpectedly telephoned Brymer to invite him to audition. Within days of that audition, Brymer was engaged as Kell's replacement and soon became one of Beecham's most devoted acolytes. He remained with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra until 1963 and considered his days in the orchestra and his relationship with Beecham as high points in his career. He continued to admire Beecham for the rest of his life, and of particular significance to him was his recording of Mozart's clarinet concerto that he made with the conductor in 1958. Although he made two further recordings of the work, with Sir Neville Marriner and Sir Colin Davis, it was his recording with Beecham that was admired most.<br>
<br>With the death of Beecham in 1961 Brymer became increasingly dissatisfied with life in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and, when William Glock invited him to join the BBC Symphony Orchestra as co-principal clarinettist with Colin Bradbury in 1963, he leapt at the chance. But when Pierre Boulez was appointed conductor of the orchestra in 1969 it soon became clear that Brymer's warm sound was at odds with Boulez's vision for the orchestra. Brymer decided therefore to leave the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1972 to become co-principal clarinettist of the London Symphony Orchestra, with Gervase de Peyer. He remained with that orchestra until 1985, when the orchestra honoured him with a seventieth birthday concert (an unusual tribute to an orchestral player). Ten years later the English Chamber Orchestra marked his eightieth birthday with a celebratory concert at which he played Mozart's clarinet concerto, the same composer's clarinet quintet (with the Medici Quartet), and Weber's clarinet concerto in F minor.<br>
<br>Although Brymer was an outstanding orchestral musician and solo clarinettist, he was also a distinguished chamber musician, jazz player, teacher, writer, and broadcaster. He was a founder-member of the Wigmore, Prometheus, and London Baroque ensembles, was the director of the London Wind Soloists and the Michael Krein Saxophone Quartet (later the London Saxophone Quartet), and was a member of the Tuckwell Wind Quartet and the Robles Ensemble. He played jazz with leading jazz musicians throughout the United States, and recorded the jazz-inspired clarinet concerto by the American composer Elie Siegmeister. He taught at the Royal Academy of Music between 1950 and 1958, the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall, between 1969 and 1973, and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1981. His three books&#151;<span class="italic">The Clarinet</span> (1976), <span class="italic">From Where I Sit</span> (1979), and <span class="italic">In the Orchestra</span> (1987)&#151;were well received, and his easy manner before the microphone meant that the radio programmes that he presented for the BBC, such as <span class="italic">At Home</span>, were popular favourites. A well-rounded person, he was a keen rugby player in his youth and enjoyed gardening and carpentry. He was honoured widely during his career and was, <i>inter alia</i>, made an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in 1955 and OBE in 1960, and received honorary degrees from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne and Kingston and De Montfort universities. He died of septicaemia and a urinary tract infection at East Surrey Hospital, Redhill, on 16 September 2003. He was survived by his wife and son.<br>
