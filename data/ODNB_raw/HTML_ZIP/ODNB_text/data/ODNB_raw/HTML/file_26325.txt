<span class="headword">Staunton, Sir  George Thomas</span>, second baronet  (1781&#150;1859), <span class="occ">Sinologist and politician</span>, was born on 26 May 1781 at Milford House, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, only surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26324/', "Sir George Leonard Staunton (1737&#150;1801)")</script>, diplomatist, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Collins (1753&#150;1823). His father imposed peculiar educational notions on the boy; he was educated at home under his father's eye and lived entirely in adult society, developing precocious abilities at languages and natural history. In 1792 he attended the turbulent national assembly in Paris while accompanying his father to Naples to recruit Chinese interpreters. He was instructed in Chinese by two native missionaries, these lessons continuing on his voyage with his father later in 1792 as part of Lord Macartney's diplomatic mission to China. Staunton, who was nominally a page to the ambassador, was able to write Chinese characters, and was the only member of the embassy who could speak Chinese to the emperor.<br>
<br>In 1797 Staunton was entered as a fellow&#150;commoner of Trinity College, Cambridge, but his father soon withdrew his name in disgust at the supposed injustice of the college examinations. He then obtained his son's appointment as a writer in the East India Company's factory at Canton (Guangzhou) (1798). Staunton returned to China in 1799 to endure the two gloomiest years of his life. He inherited his father's baronetcy in 1801, and advanced to be supercargo (1804) and chief interpreter (1808) at Canton. He was the first Englishman at the factory to have studied Chinese. The climate, business life, and his companions were all irksome to Staunton, but he devised for himself constructive avocations. He translated into Chinese and printed George Pearson's treatise on vaccination (1805) and translated China's penal code (published London, 1810). He was disappointed when his proposed appointment as ambassador to Peking (Beijing) was abandoned in 1809.<br>
<br>In January 1816 Staunton was promoted to be chief of the Canton factory, and in July was appointed to accompany Lord Amherst's embassy to Peking. It was intended to protest to the emperor at the mandarins' conduct towards the Canton merchants, but the embassy returned in January 1817 without obtaining an imperial interview. Staunton was delicate and incapable of great physical exertion, but displayed courage and determination on various occasions: despite being threatened with detention by the Chinese he insisted to Amherst that the British envoys must not <i>kowtow</i> before the emperor. &#145;Having accomplished my favourite object, of revisiting Pekin in a diplomatic capacity; and, having accumulated a competent fortune in addition to my patrimonial inheritance &hellip; I rejoiced to find myself able to terminate the period of my banishment, at the early age of six-and-thirty&#146;  (Staunton, 73&#150;4). He reached England in June 1817.<br>
<br>Staunton, a liberal tory, was elected MP for the close borough of Mitchell, Cornwall, in 1818, but left the borough in 1826 after differences with its patron over Roman Catholic emancipation, which Staunton supported. He was returned for Heytesbury, Wiltshire, in 1830 and 1831. Following parliamentary reform, he was elected with Palmerston in 1832 for the new constituency of South Hampshire, but was defeated there in 1835 and 1837. He finally represented Portsmouth through three parliaments (1838&#150;52). Staunton was a Canningite until 1827, and generally supported Lord Liverpool, but opposed ultra-tories upon the Roman Catholic question. After Wellington's declaration of opposition to parliamentary reform (1830), he gave independent support to the Liberals. He was nominated to the East India committee (1830) and tea duties committee (1834) of the House of Commons. He supported Ashley's motion against the opium trade (1843) and spoke on colonial issues.<br>
<br>Staunton's life in England was contented, though he desired government employment and felt aggrieved at not being promoted to the privy council. He had inherited 1200 acres at Clydagh in Galway, but seldom visited Ireland, and bought Leigh Park in Hampshire in 1819. He added a &#145;gothick&#146; library to the house, and constructed hothouses for his rare flowers and exotic fruits. Between 1818 and 1850 he travelled extensively in Europe. Staunton was FRS (1803), DCL of Oxford (1818), and sometime foreign secretary of the Royal Academy, parliamentary trustee of the Hunterian collection, and vice-president of the British Association of Science. In 1823 he was a founder of the Royal Asiatic Society, to which he presented his collection of 3000 Chinese volumes. His <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Notices Relating to China</span> (1822) contains interesting if digressive accounts of the Canton factory and Amherst's embassy. Among other scholarly publications he edited a history of China for the Hakluyt Society (1853). Staunton was modest and amiable, with shy, awkward manners; his memoirs were privately printed in 1856. Staunton died, unmarried, after several paralytic seizures, on 10 August 1859, at his London home, 17 Devonshire Street, Marylebone and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery; his baronetcy then became extinct.<br>
