<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whetstone,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1550, <em>d.</em> 1587), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London, where he was baptized at St Lawrence, Old Jewry, on 27 July 1550, the third son of Robert Whetstone (<i>d</i>. 1557), a wealthy merchant and haberdasher, and Margaret, daughter of Philip Barnard of Suffolk. Whetstone's father had been imprisoned in the Tower in 1554 after acting as foreman of the Guildhall jury which had refused to find Sir Nicholas Throckmorton guilty of treason after his part in Wyatt's rebellion, as reported in Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. He was fined &pound;2000 for his conduct, but released from seven months' imprisonment after paying about a tenth of this sum.<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlyyears"></a>Family and early years</h2>On their father's death, estates in Essex, Leicestershire, Middlesex, Kent, Suffolk, and Yorkshire were part of the Whetstone children's patrimony: George received from his father's estate London houses in Cheapside and Gutter Lane later valued at &pound;23 a year. Despite coming of age in 1571, he did not receive his inheritance until 1573, signing the receipt &#145;Per me Georgium Whetstonn&#146;. Throughout the 1570s there were legal battles over the children's inheritance following Margaret Whetstone's remarriage to Robert Browne of Northamptonshire. Browne was a neighbour of Sir Thomas Cecil, and Cecil's kindness to the family was acknowledged by Whetstone in his dedication to &#145;The Orchard of Repentance&#146; in <span class="italic">The Rocke of Regarde</span> (1576):<blockquote>righte worshipfull, waying howe deepely bothe my good mother and all her children are bounde unto you for received friendships, among the rest (acknowledging your desire of my well doing) I have sought howe (for suche benefites) to avoyde the vile vice of ingratitude.</blockquote>After Browne's death in 1572 his widow married Francis Ashby of a Leicestershire family. As a child, Whetstone probably lived in Cheapside with his stepfather and mother, although he may have spent time on Browne's estate at Walcot. He did not, unlike some of his brothers, attend university until his inheritance from his father in 1573, after which he registered to study law at Furnival's Inn. He addresses a poem in <span class="italic">The Rocke of Regarde</span>, &#145;written from my lodging in Holborne&#146; to &#145;my friends and companions at Furnival's Inn&#146;.<br>
<br>Accounts of Whetstone's life at this period have tended, in the absence of much hard evidence, to take for truth a colourful and supposedly autobiographical section of <span class="italic">The Rocke of Regarde</span>, in which the young hero seeks preferment at court but is unsuccessful and, having spent his inheritance on dissolute living, becomes an officer in the army and serves in the Low Countries. There is, however, nothing to corroborate this account of Whetstone's career, and, indeed, he denies in his later work <span class="italic">The Honorable Reputation of a Soldier</span> (1586) that he had had any military experience before going to the Netherlands with his older brother Barnard in 1585&#150;6. The autobiographical application of <span class="italic">The Rocke of Regarde</span> cannot, however, be entirely resisted. At the end of his <span class="italic">A Touchstone for the Time</span> (1584), Whetstone asserts that the earlier work was indeed true:<blockquote>no man was ever assaulted with a more daungerous strategeme of cosonage than my selfe, with which my life &amp; living was hardly beset. No man has more cause to thanke God for a free delivery than my self, nor anie man ever sawe, more suddaine vengeance inflicted upon his adversaries, than I my selfe of mine: as lively appeareth in the ende of my booke intituled <span class="italic">The Rocke of Regarde</span>.</blockquote>This allusion is to the legal battle which lasted some three years in the Star Chamber, and its fictionalized counterpart in the section of <span class="italic">The Rocke of Regarde</span> entitled &#145;The Invention of P. Plasmos&#146;. From these accounts, it seems that in a complicated fraud, Whetstone was tricked into signing over his property to four acquaintances who then tried to implicate him in violent quarrels so that he would be killed and thus the property would revert to them. Whetstone took the four to court to get redress: the outcome of the lengthy process is not known.<br>
<br>Perhaps this experience stirred the interest in social and legal reform which characterizes much of Whetstone's diverse literary output. His literary career may have received its initial stimulus from the group of writers associated with the inns of court, and many of his early poems are enmeshed in personal networks of friendship and obligation: his first published verse was in commendation of George Gascoigne's <span class="italic">Flowers</span>, published in 1575, and in 1577 Whetstone was to begin his career as an elegist with a volume of poetry entitled <span class="italic">A Remembraunce of the Wel Imployed Life and Godly End of George Gaskoigne</span>, claiming to have been an eyewitness to the poet's death while Gascoigne was staying at Whetstone's house in Stamford, Lincolnshire. His further elegies commemorating Sir Nicholas Bacon (1579), Sir James Dyer (1582), Thomas Radcliffe, earl of Sussex (1583), and Francis Russell, earl of Bedford (1585), culminated in his verse life of Sir Philip Sidney in 1587, of whose death at Zutphen he may have heard from Barnard Whetstone, who also provided an account of Sidney's funeral published with the elegy. In his poem, George Whetstone likens himself to a Homer praising an English Alexander, and his apparently carefully researched biography takes Sidney from childhood virtue and education, via his travels in Europe from which he returned untainted by foreign influences, his courtliness, his manly courage in the Netherlands, to his eloquent death speech. Whetstone is little concerned with Sidney as a writer, although he does mention the <span class="italic">Arcadia</span> as &#145;unmacht for sweete devise&#146;. Sidney's death predated Whetstone's own by almost a year, but the two events have some curious connections. Whetstone's death was publicly announced by his publisher, Thomas Cadman, in an epistle to the reader of <span class="italic">Sir Phillip Sidney, his Honorable Life, his Valiant Death, and True Virtues</span>; and it seems likely that the Captain Edmond Uvedall or Udall at whose hand Whetstone met his own death was the same person that he had praised in his elegy on Sidney. It is not clear that Whetstone knew the subjects of his elegies personally, but he was conscious that, as the elegy on Sussex puts it, &#145;some skill I have on good men's tombs to write&#146; and ever aware of the classical ideas of fame and posterity through verse. In his apparent care to ascertain detailed information about his subjects, he has a claim to be called the first professional biographer.<h2>
<a name="PromosandCassandraandotherworks"></a>Promos and Cassandra and other works</h2>Whetstone's most famous work, an apparently unperformed two-part play called <span class="italic">Promos and Cassandra</span> (1578), is his best-known because it is a major source for Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span> (1604). Its title-page suggests the proximity of the two stories: &#145;In the fyrste parte is showne, the unsufferable abuse, of a lewde Magistrate: the virtuous behaviours of a chaste Ladye: the uncontrowled leawdenes of a favoured Curtisan. And the undeserved estimation of a pernicious Parasyte&#146;. Whetstone's tale of urban low life was dedicated &#145;to his worshipfull friende and Kinseman William Fleetewoode Esquier, Recorder of London&#146;. This dedication, like the rest of the play, shows his abiding interest in civic life and morals, and his depiction of the underworld urban characters in <span class="italic">Promos and Cassandra</span> adds a distinctly contemporary feel to his Italian source. Promos is the equivalent of Shakespeare's Angelo, a deputy left in charge of Julio, a city in Hungary; Cassandra is the Isabella figure who comes to plead for her brother's life. Whetstone's additions and alterations to his source material are taken up by Shakespeare in a number of ways: Whetstone's sense of the urban moral landscape, his stress on the emotional relationships between the characters, and his tempering of the crime of his Claudio, here called Andrugio, from rape to pre-marital but mutual sexual intercourse all reappear in Shakespeare's play. Like Philip Sidney in his <span class="italic">Defence of Poesy</span>, Whetstone stresses that the function of dramatic literature is didactic: &#145;the conclusion showes, the confusion of Vice, and the cherising of Vertue&#146;. He decries the fashion for transgressing the dramatic unities, arguing that it is the particular fault of the English playwright that &#145;he fyrst groundes his worke on impossibilities&#146;, and also condemns generic mingling, explaining to Fleetwood that it is &#145;decorum&#146;, derived from the authority of Plato, which has encouraged him to divide the play into two parts so as to separate out its divergent generic trajectories.<br>
<br>The dedication to <span class="italic">Promos and Cassandra</span> explains that the author has not had time to correct his work, because he has &#145;resolved to accompane, the adventurous Capraie, Syr Humfrey Gylbert, in his honorable voiadge&#146;. Whetstone travelled on the <i>Hope</i> under the command of Gilbert's half-brother Carew Ralegh, on an expedition beset by bad winds and ship defects which seems never to have got beyond the west coast of Ireland. After his return to England, he travelled in Italy during 1580, visiting Rome, Naples, and Ravenna. It seems unlikely, given the tenor of his published opinions, that he was the &#145;Whetstonn&#146; listed among supposed English Catholics remaining in France in April 1580  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1579&#150;80</i>, 279).<br>
<br>In 1582 Whetstone published the main literary fruits of his Italian tour, his <span class="italic">Heptameron of Civill Discourses</span>, a series of courtly Italianate romance stories. He dedicated the work to Sir Christopher Hatton and, in his epistle, mentions in veiled terms the Italian nobleman shadowed as Phyloxenus, the originator of the stories. T. W.'s dedicatory poem gives an indication of Whetstone's didactic literary aims, announcing that:<blockquote>
<div>Morall Whetstone, to his Countrey doth impart,<br>
</div>
<div>A Worke of worth.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>The collection is particularly concerned with the condition of marriage, and different stories illustrate the folly of forced or hasty marriages, ways of maintaining love within marriage, and general precepts for married and unmarried alike. A prose version of <span class="italic">Promos and Cassandra</span> is included. The <span class="italic">Heptameron</span> was reprinted under the title <span class="italic">Aurelia, the Paragon of Pleasure and Princely Delights</span>, in 1593.<br>
<br>In 1584 Whetstone published the moralistic collection <span class="italic">A Mirror for Magistrates</span>, dedicated to the mayor, aldermen, and recorder of London and expounding the example of the Roman emperor Severus in suppressing urban vices such as insanitary conditions, prostitution, usury, and gambling. This classical precedent was given a more local application in <span class="italic">A Touchstone for the Time</span> (1584), which comprises a detailed discussion of the London underworld with suggestions for civic reform, including the suppression of prostitution and the closing of taverns and gaming houses. In a similar vein <span class="italic">The English Myrror</span> was published in 1586. Its detailed title-page gives an indication of its tone and content:<blockquote>A regard wherein al estates may behold the Conquests of Envy: containing the ruine of common weales, murther of Princes, causes of heresies, and in all ages, spoile of devine and humane blessings [&hellip;] publishing the peaceable victories obtained by the Queenes most excellent Majesty, against this mortall enimie of publicke peace and prosperitie.</blockquote>This compendium of historical narrative, proverbial wisdom, and patriotic encomium combines the moralistic concerns of his earlier works and makes explicit the protestant fervour which had underlined them. Unlike other near contemporaries such as Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, or Thomas Dekker, Whetstone's anatomization of urban failings does not slip into cynicism, nor does he take an obvious vicarious enjoyment in the vices he describes. By contrast with these other writers, his didacticism is apparently sincerely felt.<br>
<br>The same tone is evident in <span class="italic">The Censure of a Loyall Subject</span>, published in 1587 with a second edition in quick succession to take account of the execution of Mary, queen of Scots. The book takes the form of a dialogue between three interlocutors about the hanging of those implicated in the Babington conspiracy in 1586. It has been suggested that the character of &#145;Weston&#146;, who has not witnessed the executions, is a figure for the author  (Izard, 221). His conduct book for soldiers <span class="italic">Honourable Reputation of a Soldier</span> was published in London in 1585, and in Leiden the following year with a parallel Dutch translation and vocabulary and pronunciation appendices designed to help Dutch readers learn English. The book is less concerned with military strategy than with personal conduct, stressing the importance of religious preparation as well as courage and mercy in warfare.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>In 1587 Whetstone got a fatal taste of warfare. At the instigation of Burghley, to whom he had dedicated <span class="italic">The Censure of a Loyall Subject</span>, he was appointed &#145;commissary of musters&#146;  (Eccles, &#145;Whetstone's death&#146;, 648) under the mustermaster-general, the mathematician Thomas Digges, in the Low Countries. He was killed in a duel outside the garrison town of Bergen-op-Zoom in September 1587, having accused his adversary Udall of financial abuses. Digges wrote that Whetstone died &#145;no doubt because he could not be corrupted&#146;  (ibid.); the comment draws together Whetstone's life and his work in a way he, as a biographer, would have admired, and suggests that he died by the principles of honesty and uprightness his work had consistently advocated as the proper conduct of rulers, citizens, and nations. Udall was acquitted of his murder by a military court who judged that he had acted in defence of his reputation. Whetstone's wife, Anne, of whom no more is known, was named in letters of administration regarding his will in January 1580.<br>
<br>Whetstone's literary reputation has left some traces. Francis Meres, in his <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> (1598), included him with &#145;the most passionate among us to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of love&#146;, although it is not clear from his extant work that he is primarily a love-poet. In 1586 William Webbe identified him as one worthy to &#145;weare the Lawrell wreathe &hellip; a man singularly well skyld in his faculty of Poetrie&#146;  (E. Arber, ed., <span class="italic">A Discourse of English Poetrie</span>, 1871, 35). Neither of these comments captures the ceaseless and earnest didacticism about individual and civic behaviour which is so characteristic of Whetstone's writing.<br>
