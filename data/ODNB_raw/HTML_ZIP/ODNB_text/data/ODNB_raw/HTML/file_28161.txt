<span class="headword">Vaux,  Laurence</span>  (1519&#150;1585), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born in Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire. He appears from the similarity in their coats of arms to have been distantly related to the Vaux family of Harrowden. He seems to have moved from Manchester grammar school to Queen's College, Oxford, and then to Corpus Christi College, where he attracted the attention of James Brooks, who was a fellow of the college and was bishop of Gloucester in Mary's reign, when Vaux served him as a chaplain. Cuthbert Scott, the bishop of Chester, ordained him priest in the collegiate church at Manchester on 24 September 1542. With the Edwardian dissolution of the college Vaux received a pension of &pound;8 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. In 1548 he was listed as a curate of Manchester church with a yearly salary of &pound;12 19<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. In 1556 he was admitted BTh at Oxford. In 1558 he became warden of the refounded collegiate church at Manchester. Towards the end of Mary's reign the college was used as a prison for protestants, but Vaux was never accused of cruelty.<br>
<br>After Elizabeth's first parliament passed the <span class="roman">Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy</span>, Vaux fled Manchester and took with him some of the college plate and vestments. Dodd reports that he went to Ireland where he fell in among brigands who robbed him of all his substance. Vaux himself did not mention the loss of the college plate, however, and he left some of it in his will. Vaux gave no indication why he had gone to Ireland, but his stay there was short, because he was hiding in Lancashire in 1561. His religious work came to the attention of the council who ordered him to remain in Worcestershire. Shortly after this Vaux left England and settled in Louvain, where he found his former bishop, Cuthbert Scott, who died on 3 October 1564. Vaux seems to have kept a school there.<br>
<br>During Vaux's stay in Louvain, Pope Pius V appointed Thomas Harding and Nicholas Sander apostolic delegates for England with faculties to be communicated to priests in England. The pope also forbade English Catholics to attend services in the Church of England. In 1566 Vaux visited Rome and was present at a papal consistory where the pope explained the faculties he had granted to Harding and Sander; Vaux was to communicate that explanation to them. After Vaux told Sander and Harding of the pope's directives they suggested that Vaux and William Allen return to England to announce the papal ban on attending the Church of England. They could not go themselves because they were involved in a pamphlet war with protestant divines which would make them marked men in England. Sander wrote a pastoral letter announcing the papal ban which Vaux and Allen were to circulate among their friends. Sander's letter does not survive, but Vaux also wrote a letter which preserved Sander's principal points. Vaux's work in Lancashire spreading the news of the papal prohibition again attracted the attention of the government, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.<br>
<br>Vaux was back in Louvain in 1567, having left England at the same time as Allen. While teaching at his school Vaux wrote a catechism for his students which he had printed as <span class="italic">A Catechisme, or Christian Doctrine, Necessary for Children and Ignorant People</span> (Louvain, 1567). It was his only publication, although another edition appeared at Antwerp in 1574, and two further editions in 1583. While similar in some ways to Bonner's 1555 <span class="italic">A Profitable and Necessary Doctrine</span>, the catechism differed in others. Vaux, like Bonner, avoided some controversial topics such as saints, purgatory, transubstantiation, and indulgences. Where Bonner's catechism treated holy water simply as a reminder of baptism, Vaux endowed it with apotropaic powers. The most significant difference between Bonner and Vaux is that Vaux defined salvation as resulting from faith and works as distinct from the Marian position, which cited faith alone joined with charity. Vaux's catechism also reproduced the medieval canon law for marriage. On 10 August 1572, the feast of St Laurence, he became a novice in the canons regular of St Augustine. Upon his entrance he received a letter from Thomas Goldwell, Marian bishop of St Asaph and a religious exile in Rome. Before taking his religious vows on 3 May 1573 he executed legal documents to preserve the Manchester plate and property &#145;until such time as the college should be restored to the Catholic faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Vaux was later elected sub-prior and may have returned to England to seek vocations for the foundation of an English community.<br>
<br>In 1580 William Allen persuaded the superior-general of the Society of Jesus to begin an English mission. Gregory XIII realized that the only Catholic bishop left in England was Bishop Watson, who had been in confinement for years. He decided to send Bishop Goldwell back to England and with him his friend Laurence Vaux; Goldwell's presence in England would restore regular ecclesiastical government, and may have been based on the hope of limited toleration that was expected to result from the negotiations for the French match. By the time that the party of missionaries left Rome the negotiations had failed. Because of the publicity attending the departure of Campion and Persons for England, Goldwell did not leave the continent; Vaux, however, did. Upon his arrival he and another priest were turned over to the English by a French spy who had sailed the channel with them. After his initial examination Vaux was imprisoned at the Gatehouse at Westminster where the conditions were not bad. His letters describe the neat room he had and the quality of the food, all of which cost him &pound;16 per year. In April 1584 Vaux was moved to the less comfortable Clink, apparently because copies of his catechism began circulating in the Manchester area. In 1585 he appeared before John Aylmer, bishop of London, and other royal commissioners. Aylmer asked Vaux if he were any relation to the Vaux who had written the popish catechism; Vaux admitted that the catechism was his. The bishop thought that Vaux should be executed, but Lord Burghley seems to have intervened for him. He died in the Clink some time in 1585. The cause of death is unknown. The Jesuit John Gibbons lists him as a martyr in his <span class="italic">Concertatio</span>, but that term is not normally used to describe those who died for their faith while in prison. The chronicle of the convent of St Martin in Louvain claimed that he was &#145;famished to death&#146;  (Gibson, 187).<br>
