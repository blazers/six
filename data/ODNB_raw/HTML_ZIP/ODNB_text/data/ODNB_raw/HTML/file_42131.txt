<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Haggar,  (Arthur) William</span>  (1851&#150;1925), <span class="occ">travelling showman and film-maker</span>, was born in Stratford Road, Dedham, Essex, on 10 March 1851, the son of an unknown father and Mary Elizabeth Hagger (<i>b</i>. 1830). He had a hard childhood, despised for his illegitimacy, and brought up by various distant and uncaring relatives. He gained skills in carpentry through his employment in a sawmill, then when aged twenty he joined a touring theatrical troupe, encouraged by Sarah Hemming (1851&#150;1909) of the Walton Theatre Company, whom he married at Fakenham, Norfolk, on 31 March 1871. They had eleven children, eight of whom survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>The Haggars eked out a precarious existence touring the country with such everlasting productions as <span class="italic">East Lynne</span> and <span class="italic">Maria Marten</span>. William hawked picture frames when dates dried up, or put on puppet shows when he could not afford to hire actors. The family's fortunes turned when they moved to south Wales in 1890, where the swelling population brought about by the coal-mining boom brought them sufficient audiences to merit establishing a second portable theatre. Late in 1897 he purchased a cinematograph and magic lantern outfit from a dealer in Exeter, complete with a handful of films and slides, for the considerable sum of &pound;80. He took his &#145;bioscope&#146; film show around the fairgrounds of Wales. After a faltering start, when the show was threatened by a coal strike, the audience's unfamiliarity with what a cinematograph show actually was, and a serious fire, Haggar attracted increasing audiences. This allowed for investment in an electricity generator which added greatly to the professionalism of the bioscope show. Fairgrounds were the breeding ground of cinema exhibition in the UK, and for Haggar the route to fortune after a lifetime of hard travelling, penury, and at times near starvation.<br>
<br>Haggar moved into film production in 1901 initially to provide his Welsh audiences with topical films of local news and sporting events. It was when he combined film-making with his theatrical inheritance that his great contribution to the early history of Welsh and British cinema was made. Between 1903 and 1908 he made around sixty films, including such titles as <span class="italic">The Sign of the Cross</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The Life of Charles Peace</span> (1905), <span class="italic">A Message from the Sea</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">The Dumb Man of Manchester</span> (1908). The cast were members of his extended family, the subjects either abbreviated versions of dramas they had performed on tour or knockabout comedies, the locations invariably in the open air (the peripatetic Haggars had no studio). The vigorous style of these multi-scene dramas showed a real understanding of the particular power of cinema, and of the tastes of his working-class audience. Haggar's theatrical background could have led him to produce photographic facsimiles of these works with a static camera, but instead he showed an instinctive grasp of cutting, action, and variety of shot as being the lifeblood of cinema. At least ten of his films are known to survive (some incomplete), among which <span class="italic">The Life of Charles Peace</span>, which illustrates the career of the famed burglar and murderer, concluding with a graphic enactment of his hanging, has been particularly admired for its vitality of theme and technique.<br>
<br>Haggar toured with the films around the fairgrounds of Wales, his bioscope show now transported by steam traction engine and accompanied by an elaborate organ, with a troupe of dancing girls to attract custom. But the films were seen far beyond their south Wales base, being handled by the Warwick Trading Company and then by Gaumont. His exciting 1903 drama <span class="italic">A Desperate Poaching Affray</span> sold the huge number of 480 copies and was distributed in America (as <span class="italic">The Poachers</span>) where it proved influential in helping create the taste for chase films.<br>
<br>After 1908 Haggar retired from fiction film production, as more polished productions from American and European studios found greater favour with audiences. A few topical films were produced, but mostly the Haggars' show now featured films made by others. In 1914, however, his eldest son William (1871&#150;1935) persuaded his father to help produce a feature-length version of <span class="italic">The Maid of Cefn Ydfa</span>, a work previously filmed by the Haggars and particularly popular with local audiences. The incoherent, stage-bound interiors (directed by the son) contrasted awkwardly with the livelier exteriors (directed by the father), and in any case the Haggar style was unsuited to the narrative demands of longer films.<br>
<br>Haggar moved from fairgrounds to cinemas, setting up a small chain of cinemas in Wales from 1910, including the Kosy cinema in Aberdare (opened August 1915), where he finally settled down after a lifetime on the road. His wife, Sarah, had died in 1909, and on 19 March 1912 he married Mary Jane (May) Davies (1884&#150;1924) in Aberdare&#151;the groom was sixty-one, the bride twenty-eight. He became a poor law guardian and local councillor. His second wife died, aged just forty, in 1924, and William died soon after, in Aberdare, on 4 February 1925. He was buried in Aberdare cemetery. A number of his large family followed him into cinema management.<br>
<br>William Haggar was of the people and made films for the people. His surviving work captures the spirit of the fairground bioscope, where enthusiastic audiences booed the figures of authority and cheered the escaping renegades. The films were as rough-and-ready as their audiences, and to experience them now is to feel a great sympathy for those for whom they were made and to understand a little of how those people could, for a brief time, escape the hard times in which they lived.<br>
