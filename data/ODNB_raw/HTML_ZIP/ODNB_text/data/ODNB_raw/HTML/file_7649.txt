<span class="headword">Dillingham,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Deane, Bedfordshire. He matriculated as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, in June 1583, graduating BA early in 1587 and proceeding MA in 1590. From 1594 he was a fellow of the college, resigning in 1599, the year of his admission to the degree of BD. Fuller reports his father's testimony that Dillingham was:<blockquote>an excellent linguist and subtle disputant &hellip; a Greek act was kept, between him and William Alabaster of Trinity College, to their mutual commendation; a disputation so famous that it served for an era or epoch for the scholars in that age thence to date their seniority. (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 1.170&#150;71)</blockquote>Ordained priest by Bishop Wickham of Lincoln, Dillingham was instituted in 1601, on the presentation of a gentleman, John Roult, to the rectory of Wilden, Bedfordshire, which had been rated in the <i>valor ecclesiasticus</i> at the large annual sum of &pound;18 7<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>Dillingham was a prolific writer on religious themes. The frequency of his publications, and the dedications to prominent men and women which so often preface them, suggest that he was well connected as well as prosperous. In <span class="italic">A Disswasive from Poperie</span> (1599) the author recalls, in his dedication to Oliver Lord St John, his &#145;honourable and singular favour towards me and all my friends&#146;. By 1617, in <span class="italic">Enchiridion Chrisianae</span> [<i>sic</i>], the even greater eminence of Archbishop Abbot appears as the object of Dillingham's prefatory obsequies. He was chosen to work on the translation of the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> published in 1611. It is clear, however, that Dillingham was acutely aware that few clergymen were as comfortably placed as himself, and that he hoped for reforms. Dedicating <span class="italic">A Silver Locke</span> (1611) to Lady Sara Hastings he laments the times, with their &#145;deluge and flood of iniquity &hellip; a great and main cause thereof no doubt, is the example of great men&#146;, and asks whether they are &#145;to be laughed at, or rather to be pitied, who are puffed up with their greatness, and have no religion in them, which is the greatest jewel in the world&#146;  (Dillingham). A second epistle directs to William Barlow, bishop of Lincoln, some outspoken criticism of the meanness of lay patrons, a chief cause of clerical impoverishment; also included in the book is a long attack on simoniacal practices in the church.<br>
<br>It has been plausibly suggested that Dillingham remained unmarried, and his will (dated 14 January 1625 and proved at the Bedford archdeaconry court on 21 May) mentions neither wife nor children. But he left substantial sums to various members of the Selby family, much larger than the bequests to his own four sisters, and this may hint at an earlier marital link with that family. Dillingham named as executor and residual legatee his brother Thomas, probably the man of Jesus College, Cambridge, who was rector of Deane, Bedfordshire, between 1603 and 1632, who died there on 10 December 1647, and who was father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7650/', "Theophilus Dillingham (1613&#150;1678)")</script>. Francis Dillingham himself died at Wilden and was buried in the parish on 24 February 1625.<br>
