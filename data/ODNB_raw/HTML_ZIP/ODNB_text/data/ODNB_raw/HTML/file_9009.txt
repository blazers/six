<span class="headword">Ewald,  Ferdinand Christian</span>  (1802&#150;1874), <span class="occ">Christian missionary to the Jews</span>, was born of Jewish parentage near Bamberg, and joined the Christian faith in 1822. As a Lutheran minister he came under the aegis of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews and studied at its seminary at Palestine House, Bethnal Green, before entering the society's service in 1832. He worked for a decade among the oppressed and lowly communities of north Africa, selling bibles and distributing tracts, preaching and persuading. In 1836 he was ordained by the bishop of London, and returned to the Mediterranean coast until repeated attacks of ophthalmia forced him to return to London in 1841. He was then appointed chaplain to Michael Solomon Alexander, first Anglican bishop of Jerusalem and, like Ewald, a convert, and wrote of their work in <span class="italic">The Journal of Missionary Labours in Jerusalem, 1842&#150;1844</span> (1846). Continued ill health obliged him to return home again in 1851, when he became head of the society's London mission. He was employed there until 1870. During that time hundreds of Jews were baptized out of the thousands he had instructed, and he helped the society to set up a &#145;Wanderers' Home&#146; for the assimilation of convert Jews into their new community.<br>
<br>Ewald published in 1856 a German translation of the Talmudic treatise <span class="italic">Abodah Sarah</span> (&#145;Idolatrous worship&#146;), for which he was awarded a doctorate of philosophy by the University of Erlangen. In 1872 he was awarded by Archbishop Tait the Lambeth degree of bachelor of divinity, in recognition of his proficiency in Hebrew and oriental learning, as well as for his prominent services to the society. He died at his home, 14 Woodside Villas, Gipsy Hill, Upper Norwood, London, on 9 August 1874.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_9008"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Charles Ewald</span>  (1842&#150;1891), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in Jerusalem in 1842. He was educated abroad and appointed by open competition to a clerkship in the Public Record Office in August 1860; he was promoted senior clerk in 1872. His main responsibility was the completion of Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy's work of calendaring the Norman rolls of Henry V; Ewald's calendars were printed in the deputy keeper's reports (vols. 61&#150;2, 1880 and 1881); Ewald also prepared for this pr&eacute;cis the glossary of French words. Within the Public Record Office he was left behind in an increasingly competitive and professionalized service, but found his m&eacute;tier by writing for a wider public a great many popular works of biographical and historical character. Compilations of general English history and constitutional development were followed by <span class="italic">Our Public Records: a Brief Handbook to the National Archives</span> (1873), a serviceable but inadequate introduction. A life of Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, first published in 1875 (and apparently written partly in official time), enjoyed minor reputation, and among other works Ewald prepared a two-volume biographical compilation on Disraeli (1883) and a life of Sir Joseph Napier, the Irish lord chancellor (1887; rev. edn, 1892). Scarcely anything from his extensive literary output is worthy of remembrance, however, not even <span class="italic">How to Pass: a Civil Service Textbook</span> (1867). A pseudonymous novel, <span class="italic">Harry Disney: an Autobiography</span> by Atholl de Walden (3 vols., 1871), is attributed to him.<br>
<br>Ewald is reported to have been in line for promotion in his department at the time of his premature death at his home, 31 Victoria Road, Upper Norwood, on 20 June 1891. He was survived by his wife, Amelia Isabella.<br>
