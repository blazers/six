<span class="headword">Moulton,  James Louis</span>  (1906&#150;1993), <span class="occ">marine officer and military historian</span>, was born on 3 June 1906 at The Terrace, His Majesty's Dockyard, Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, the son of John Davis Moulton (<i>d</i>. 1921), staff captain in the Royal Navy (also JP for Kingston, Jamaica, and later harbour master, Pembroke dockyard), and his wife, Beatrice Nutter, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox. He was educated at Sutton Valence School before being commissioned into the Royal Marines in 1923. After further education at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and initial service in battleships, in 1930 he trained as a pilot and from 1930 to 1935 served in aircraft-carriers. On 19 June 1937 he married Barbara Aline (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of John Melville Coode, of independent means. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Prior to the Second World War, Moulton was a student at the army Staff College, Camberley, and then in 1940 served on the staff of the British expeditionary force in France. He was one of the last officers to be evacuated from Dunkirk. After serving with the Royal Marine division in the seizure of Madagascar and with the directorate of combined operations, he assumed command of the newly raised 48 Royal Marines commando in March 1944, and led it during the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later during the combined assault on Walcheren Island in the autumn of that year. At the end of the war he commanded 4 commando brigade. Wounded in action (1944), he was appointed DSO (1944) and mentioned in dispatches (1946, for service with the British army of the Rhine). After the war his career continued to focus on amphibious operations. He was commanding officer of the commando school (1947&#150;9) and of 3 commando brigade (1952&#150;4, serving in the Middle East), and was chief of amphibious warfare from 1957 until his retirement in 1961; he also served as assistant chief of staff to the commandant-general, Royal Marines and as major-general, Royal Marines, Portsmouth (1954&#150;7). He was made OBE in 1950 and CB in 1956.<br>
<br>Moulton was an officer of diverse experiences, including sea duty, flying, and commanding infantry. This perspective proved invaluable in his later career, when he recognized that the amphibious assault was a truly joint and combined endeavour, requiring doctrine, training, and specialized shipping and equipment, such as helicopters and appropriate carriers for ship-to-shore movement. Stated another way, such operations could not be unique to or dominated by any single service, nor planned and executed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner. Although he served as chief of amphibious warfare between 1957 and 1961, a quarter of a century later he was credited with having ensured that Britain had the amphibious shipping necessary to conduct operations in the south Atlantic in 1981, during the Falklands War with Argentina.<br>
<br>After his retirement, Moulton became a military analyst, historian, and editor. For two years (1966&#150;8), he served as defence correspondent for the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>. More important, he was first naval editor (1964&#150;9) and then overall editor (1969&#150;73) of <span class="italic">Brassey's Annual</span>; under his name, he penned ten articles and three editorial forewords in this annual defence publication. He also wrote six books. <span class="italic">Haste to Battle</span> (1963) told the story of wartime commando operations from the perspective of the commander of 48 Royal Marines commando, while also conveying the spirit of a combat unit. In <span class="italic">A Study of War in Three Dimensions: the Norwegian Campaign of 1940</span> (1967), he analysed both joint and amphibious operations, candidly noting what the British did wrong in both approach and execution, and what the Germans did right. In <span class="italic">Battle for Antwerp: the Liberation of the City and the Opening of the Scheldt</span> (1978), he described the joint and combined assault on Walcheren Island and the operations for the vital port of Antwerp, all placed within a larger strategic context. In <span class="italic">Defence in a Changing World</span> (1964) he addressed the need to assess realistically what is in a nation's interest and to concentrate on the essentials, to have balanced forces, and to retain tradition and overseas commitments only if such are valid. Then, as Britain's role in the world changed and her military power declined, he analysed the NATO alliance, and within it the role and capability of the United Kingdom and the Royal Navy, in <span class="italic">British Maritime Strategy in the 70s</span> (1969). Moulton also wrote an overview history of his corps, <span class="italic">The Royal Marines</span> (1972, 2nd edn, 1981). Amid these diverse writings, his analyses remained relevant at the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first centuries.<br>
<br>Moulton was born while the British empire was still in its ascendancy, was commissioned into the Royal Marines at its greatest height, and commenced his military career in an era still dominated by the big gun battleship. By the end of his military career, the empire was gone, Britain's commitments overseas continued to dwindle, and the naval services were a shadow of their former strength. Throughout all of this he was a consummate professional military officer, an exemplary leader of men in combat and peace, and a realist in assessing international affairs and supporting strategies, in recognizing the possibilities of harnessing technological change to military needs, and in comprehending the need for joint (multiservice) and combined (multinational) operations. He was an excellent example of the experienced, reflective professional which all armed forces need to accomplish effectively the tasks their political leaders assign to them. He represented at its best the dedication and professionalism of the British military officer corps. He died of cancer at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, on 22 November 1993, and was survived by his wife and two children.<br>
