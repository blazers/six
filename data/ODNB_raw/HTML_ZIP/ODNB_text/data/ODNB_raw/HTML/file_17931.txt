<span class="headword">Mangey,  Thomas</span>  (1683/4&#150;1755), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and classical scholar</span>, was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of Arthur Mangey, a goldsmith of Leeds. He was educated at the Leeds Free School, then entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1704, graduating BA in 1708 and MA in 1711. In 1715 he was granted a fellowship at St John's, which he resigned in 1718. He proceeded LLD in 1719, and in 1725 he was one of the seven who received a doctorate at the hands of Dr Bentley, when the latter delivered the famous oration subsequently prefixed to his edition of Terence.<br>
<br>Mangey received deacon's orders on 5 March 1710 and was ordained to the priesthood in November 1711. He held the rectory of Stanfield, Norfolk, in 1711&#150;12, and that of St Nicholas's, Guildford, from 1717 to 1720. Subsequently he was presented with the vicarage of Ealing, Middlesex, which he resigned in 1754, and the rectory of St Mildred's, Bread Street, London, which he retained until his death. He became chaplain to the bishop of London, John Robinson, no later than 1719. When Robinson, at the request of Bishop Crew, consecrated Sunderland church, on 4 September 1719, Mangey preached the sermon &#145;The holiness of Christian churches&#146;, for which he may have been rewarded with a promotion to the fifth stall in Durham Cathedral in 1721, whence he moved to the first stall in January 1722. When treasurer of the chapter at Durham, he greatly advanced the fines upon the tenants, and improved the rents of his prebendal lands by nearly &pound;100 a year. He married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1780), one of the daughters of John Sharp, archbishop of York, and they had a son, John, who was to enter the church too and be collated to the vicarage of Dunmow, Essex, by Bishop Secker. Thomas Mangey died at Durham on 6 March 1755, and was buried five days later in the east transept of the cathedral, where a monument stands to his memory. His epitaph was composed by John Sharp, his nephew by marriage, then official to the archdeaconry of Northumberland, who was to become a fully-fledged archdeacon, and a prebendary of Durham in his turn.<br>
<br>Mangey was an erudite philologist and a prolific writer. His great work was his bilingual edition, in Latin and Greek, of <span class="italic">Philonis Judaei opera</span>, with a copious critical footnote apparatus and a long preface in Latin (2 vols., 1742), which Edward Harwood considered as &#145;magnificent&#146; even though he detected &#145;a very considerable number of inaccuracies&#146;  (Harwood, 76). The voluminous manuscript materials collected by Mangey for this edition, together with his collations of the different readings of scriptural and classical texts and his commonplace book, mostly written in Latin and Greek, bear witness to his meticulous scholarship.<br>
<br>Mangey's other printed works included polemical anti-deistic pamphlets. His <span class="italic">Remarks upon Nazarenus</span> (1718; 2nd edn, 1719) called forth John Toland's reply in the latter's <span class="italic">Tetradymus</span> (1720). Similarly, Mangey's anti-Socinian sermon <span class="italic">The Eternal Existence of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (1719) was challenged by an opponent writing under the pseudonym of Phileleutherus Cantabrigiensis, who was promptly identified as Thomas Herne. Mangey's other published sermons, many of which were preached to prestigious audiences at Whitehall, before the House of Commons, or at the anniversary meetings of famous charities, either pursued an explicitly apologetic aim or dealt with the commonplace theme of benevolence and philanthropy.<br>
