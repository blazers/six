<span class="headword">Manners,  John</span>, first duke of Rutland  (1638&#150;1711), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was born on 29 May 1638 at Boughton, Northamptonshire, the third and only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17956/', "Sir John Manners (1604&#150;1679)")</script> of Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, and Frances (1613&#150;1671), daughter of Edward, first Baron Montagu of Boughton, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19034/', "William Montagu (1618/19&#150;1706)")</script>. Manners's father became eighth earl of Rutland and inherited Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, in 1641, following the failure of the senior Manners line. Manners's childhood was disrupted by the civil war. His father was a &#145;lukewarm Parliamentarian&#146;  (Stone, <span class="italic">Family</span>, 200) but Belvoir was first a royalist then a parliamentary garrison. The old castle was demolished in 1649 and rebuilt 1654&#150;68.<br>
<br>Manners (known as Lord Roos) married three times: first, on 13 July 1658, Lady Anne Pierrepoint (<i>bap</i>. 1631, <i>d</i>. 1697), daughter and coheir of Henry, first marquess of Dorchester. The total failure of this marriage had legal and potentially dynastic implications. There was at this time no legal divorce, and Manners's quarrel with his first wife initiated a legal process of separation and remarriage for the few who could afford it. Manners was granted judicial separation from bed and board in the ecclesiastical court in 1663 because of Anne's adultery. To protect the succession to his estates, Manners then obtained private acts, that of 8 February 1667 bastardizing Anne's children born since 1659 and that of 11 April 1670 granting him permission to remarry. The ensuing parliamentary debates attracted disproportionate attention because of revelations about Anne's sexual promiscuity, the challenge to beliefs about the indissolubility of marriage, and suggestions that the process could be adopted by Charles II to divorce his barren wife, Catherine of Braganza. Manners married second, on 10 November 1671, Lady Diana Bruce, daughter of Robert, first earl of Ailesbury, and widow of Sir Seymour Shirley; she died in childbirth on 15 July 1672. Manners's third marriage, on 8 January 1674, to Catherine (1657&#150;1733), sixteen-year-old daughter of Baptist Noel, third Viscount Campden, was successful. Two sons and two daughters were born to this marriage.<br>
<br>Manners was a rather inactive MP for Leicestershire from 1661 until 1679, when he entered the House of Lords. He supported the whigs in the exclusion crisis and in the revolution of 1688&#150;9. He never visited London after the coronation of William and Mary in 1689, pleading ill health and leaving his wife and two sons to represent him at court while he indulged his preference for country life and local politics. From 1668 to 1701 he lived at Belvoir or Haddon, and after 1701 solely at Belvoir. Manners replaced his father as lord lieutenant of Leicestershire and recorder of Grantham in 1677, and enjoyed his aristocratic role exercising local social and political power on behalf of the crown. He was generally effective, but suffered a few failures in this local authority. He influenced local elections, maintained order, and sought out illegal arms. He upset the local gentry in 1679 by inviting a second aristocrat to stand with him in the parliamentary election, contrary to the tradition of one aristocratic and one gentry candidate. Manners's election was disallowed by the Commons: he was created Baron Manners of Haddon with a seat in the House of Lords four months before his father died, when he succeeded as ninth earl. He retained the lord lieutenancy in 1681, despite supporting the whigs in the exclusion crisis, but was replaced in 1687 when James II filled offices with his supporters. He was reappointed in 1689 after the revolution, but resigned in 1702 after failing to secure his son's re-election to the Commons, and in protest at government interference in Leicestershire promoting tory interests. He was reappointed lord lieutenant from 1706 to 1711.<br>
<br>Rutland's heir, John, married on 17 August 1693 Katherine, second daughter of William, Lord Russell, the whig magnate beheaded in 1683 for participating in the Rye House plot. On 29 March 1703, partly as a result of Russell influence, the earl was created duke of Rutland and marquess of Granby, in recognition of lifetime support for whig government. Rutland died on 10 January 1711 at Belvoir Castle, and was buried on 23 February at Bottesford church, near Belvoir.<br>
