<span class="headword">Armstrong,  John <span class="st"> [Johnnie]</span>, of Gilnockie</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1530), <span class="occ">gang leader</span>, is recorded as brother to Thomas Armstrong, laird of Mangerton, and so was presumably a younger son of this branch of the Armstrongs. He lived in Canonbie parish, which was then within the notorious &#145;debatable land&#146; of the western Anglo-Scottish frontier and is now in Dumfriesshire. Two tower houses are associated with him&#151;Hollows and Gilnockie. Although his landed status in the ballad which relates his death comes from the latter stronghold (now demolished), his principal residence was probably Hollows Tower near Canonbie. He was also known as Armstrong of Staplegordon, which is situated north-west of Langholm.<br>
<br>In 1525 Armstrong bound himself in manrent to Robert, fifth Lord Maxwell. This bond gave Armstrong a substantial lease of lands in Eskdale in return for pledging that he, his heirs, kin, friends, and servants would be obliged to Maxwell in perpetuity. Bonds of manrent defined social superiority, yet their terms usually invoked mutual defence and maintenance. This doubtless explains why Armstrong's escheat was freely gifted to Lord Maxwell shortly after his execution in 1530. Maxwell may well have been a caretaker of these estates for Armstrong's young heir, Christopher. Armstrong signed the bond &#145;with my hand at the pen&#146;, indicating that he could not write  (W. Fraser, 2.462&#150;63). There is no indication of his having a formal education, but this was no disadvantage to his later criminal career.<br>
<br>There is much inconsistency between Johnnie Armstrong the notorious reiver and the folk hero of the famous &#145;Armstrang&#146; ballad. According to contemporary accounts Armstrong terrorized much of the English borderland during the 1520s. He frequently extorted blackmail, stole goods, burned houses, and kept a well-armed company of thieves to assist him in these nefarious activities. He was contemptuous of border laws and English border officials, sometimes escaping their clutches by sheer bravado. Lord Maxwell, as warden of the Scottish west march, refused to arrest any of his Armstrong clientele. This incensed the opposite English wardens, who tried to oust the Armstrongs from the debatable land in 1527. The Armstrongs retaliated by burning Netherby in the English west march. When no redress was forthcoming Lord Dacre took matters into his own hands and burned Armstrong's &#145;Hole House at Cannonby&#146; in March 1528  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4, no. 1782). This served only to inflame an already volatile situation. English complaints to the earl of Angus, as head of the Scottish administration, made him attempt a &#145;road&#146; (expedition) against the Armstrongs in April 1528. Although this came to nothing, having failed to muster sufficient local support, Angus none the less declared the Armstrongs to be rebels. This probably led to their excommunication by the archbishop of Glasgow, which made any form of contact with the Armstrongs illegal. However, the chronicler Pitscottie noted Johnnie as a good Christian before his downfall.<br>
<br>When James V ousted Angus and assumed his personal rule of Scotland, there was no change of policy concerning outlaws. The king was impatient with Lord Maxwell for not apprehending the Armstrongs and demonstrated his new authority by warding many border chiefs, including Maxwell himself, in the spring of 1530. In July he then mustered many lowland and border Scots to lead another expedition to the frontier. James was determined to rid the borders of the Armstrong problem when he reached Caerlanrig in Teviotdale on 5 July 1530. It was at this fateful place that Johnnie Armstrong and his band of followers met their end after answering the king's summons. Later historians, notably Pitscottie, have left vivid descriptions of the famous encounter, at which Armstrong and his men presented themselves in fine attire before the king, only to be greeted with the question: &#145;What wants that knave that a king suld have?&#146; Ordered to the gallows forthwith, his pleas for mercy disregarded, Armstrong retorted contemptuously, &#145;I have asked grace at a graceless face&#146;  (Scott). Many still debate the circumstances surrounding what amounted to a mass execution of terrorists. James had the right to apprehend undischarged rebels who were coincidentally seriously undermining Anglo-Scottish relations. Armstrong was specifically &#145;deid for thrift committit be him&#146;  (Fleming, 87). The men hanged with him numbered either twenty-four (Pitscottie) or forty-eight (Leslie), though they are noted only as his &#145;gallant companie&#146; near the end of the ballad. Leslie records that Armstrong's brother Geordie was spared to warn others of the fate awaiting persistent thieves. Royal authority had triumphed and the executed men were allegedly buried in a deserted churchyard.<br>
<br>Johnnie Armstrong's posthumous reputation as a hero, rather than a villain, owes much to the romanticism of Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span> (1802). Sir Herbert Maxwell's <span class="italic">History of Dumfries and Galloway</span> (1896) also shifts the blame to James V's Machiavellian tactics, alleging that Armstrong never molested any Scots, preferring to attack and terrorize only the English. In the later twentieth century, however, James V's determination to enforce law and order has been praised rather than derided by historians. Nevertheless, the enduring image of Johnnie Armstrong is of Scott's roguish gentleman who, according to the ballad &#145;Johnie Armstrang&#146;,<blockquote>
<div>wore a girdle about his middle,<br>
</div>
<div>imbroider'd ower wi' burning gold.<br>
</div> (Scott)</blockquote>He supposedly pleaded for his life with the king by offering that &#145;all between heir and Newcastle town sall pay their yeirly rent to thee&#146;, but to no avail: he was &#145;murdered at Carlinrigg&#146;. The ballad of &#145;Johnie Armstrang&#146; remains a well-composed elegy that still captivates readers regardless of its historical inaccuracies.<br>
