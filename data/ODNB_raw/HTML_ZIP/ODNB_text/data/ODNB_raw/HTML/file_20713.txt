<span class="headword">Oliphant,  Thomas</span>  (1799&#150;1873), <span class="occ">music editor and cataloguer</span>, was born on 25 December 1799 at Condie, Perthshire, in the house of his father, Ebenezer Oliphant. His mother, Mary, was the third daughter of Sir William Stirling, bt, of Ardoch, Perthshire. After being educated at Winchester College and by private tutors, he became for a short time a member of the London stock exchange, but soon relinquished commerce to devote himself to literature and music. In 1830 he was admitted to the Madrigal Society and remained an active member until his death, becoming honorary secretary in 1832, vice-president in 1871, and president in 1872. He adapted English words to a considerable number of Italian madrigals (in some cases writing his own verses, in others by merely translating the original texts) for the use of the society's members; his work amounted to some fifty English and Italian works in popular editions as well as several compilations.<br>
<br>In 1834 Oliphant took part in the chorus, as a bass, in the great Handel festival held in Westminster Abbey, and in the same year published, under the pseudonym Solomon Sackbut, <span class="italic">Comments of a Chorus Singer at the Royal Musical Festival in Westminster Abbey</span>. He also published <span class="italic">A Brief Account of the Madrigal Society</span> (1835), <span class="italic">A Short Account of Madrigals</span> (1836), and <span class="italic">La musa madrigalesca</span> (1837), a volume containing the words of nearly 400 &#145;madrigals, ballets, roundelays &amp;c. chiefly of the Elizabethan age&#146;. In 1837 he composed the words and music of a madrigal, &#145;Stay one moment, gentle sires&#146;, which he produced as the work of an unknown seventeenth-century composer, Blasio Tomasi. It was performed as such at the anniversary festival of the Madrigal Society. He wrote English versions of Beethoven's <span class="italic">Fidelio</span> and <span class="italic">The Mount of Olives</span>, and the words for numerous songs by John Hatton and other composers.<br>
<br>Oliphant was employed from November 1841 to July 1850 as a temporary assistant cataloguing the music in the British Museum. There was initial criticism of his appointment, but during his time there he cleared the backlog of uncatalogued music and also laid the foundations for the collection's expansion. He completed a catalogue of the manuscript music in 1842 and then, with the support of Antonio Panizzi, the keeper of printed books, began the process of providing a comprehensive catalogue of printed music. He resigned in 1850 following the rejection by the trustees of his memorandum for the development of music in the collections.<br>
<br>Oliphant occasionally lectured in public on musical subjects, and was requested by the directors of the Philharmonic Society to translate portions of Wagner's opera <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span>, which were performed by the society's orchestra and chorus, the composer conducting, at the Hanover Square Rooms in March 1855. Oliphant died, unmarried, on 9 March 1873, at his home, 35 Great Marlborough Street, London, and the following month his valuable private music library, which included many first and early editions of madrigals, was auctioned by Puttick and Simpson.<br>
