<span class="headword">Arundell, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1502&#150;1552), <span class="occ">administrator and convicted conspirator</span>, was the younger son of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, Cornwall (<i>c</i>.1474&#150;1545), and his first wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. by December 1503), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11560/', "Thomas Grey, first marquess of Dorset (c.1455&#150;1501)")</script>. He had one brother, Sir John Arundell (<i>c</i>.1500&#150;1557); three sisters: Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1516&times;24), who married Sir Richard Edgcumbe (<i>d</i>. 1561/2); Jane (<i>d</i>. 1577); and Eleanor; and a half-sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/723/', "Mary Arundell, countess of Sussex and Arundel (d. 1557)")</script>. In 1530 he married Margaret Howard (<i>d</i>. 1571), sister of Katherine, Henry VIII's fifth queen, and daughter of Lord Edmund Howard (<i>d</i>. 1538) and Joyce Culpeper. They had two sons, Matthew (1535&#150;1598) and Charles (<i>d</i>. 1587), and three daughters, Margaret, Dorothy (<i>c</i>.1535&#150;<i>c</i>.1578), and Jane (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1536).<br>
<br>Arundell began his career in the household of Cardinal Wolsey, for whom he became a gentleman of the privy chamber. His working relationship with Thomas Cromwell ranged from their days as contemporaries in Wolsey's household to Arundell's appointment as the first receiver of the court of augmentations for Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, and Dorset. Two months after succeeding his father in 1533 as receiver-general of the duchy of Cornwall, Arundell was created a knight of the Bath at Anne Boleyn's coronation. He served both Henry VIII and Edward VI as a JP for Cornwall, Dorset, and Somerset, and was appointed to commissions for gaol delivery, oyer and terminer, and the defence of the western coastline. During the Pilgrimage of Grace and the king's French expedition in 1544 Sir Thomas commanded the Dorset militia. His cousin Henry Grey, third marquess of Dorset, employed him in estate management and he was general receiver for the earl of Northumberland. For the town of Salisbury he was high bailiff, and he was keeper of royal parks in Dorset and twice sheriff of Dorset and Somerset. In 1539 he sat on the council of the west with his father. He served as receiver to Anne of Cleves and chancellor to Katherine Parr, and was appointed to survey the ordnance in the Tower. His pedigree, marriage, and developing service to the government undoubtedly enabled him greatly to increase his wealth through the acquisition of former religious properties. In 1547 he purchased Wardour Castle in Wiltshire, thus establishing what became the most enduring and important branch of the great Cornish Arundell family; Henry VIII had been considering Sir Thomas for a barony at his death. He sat as knight of the shire for Dorset in 1545 and 1547.<br>
<br>Birth and marriage connected Arundell to the crown and to many of the most important families in England. By the reign of Edward VI he was one of the most experienced government officers in the country. However, his name was removed from the late king's list of proposed honours, reflecting the new regime's concern with Arundell's connections, experience, and importance. Sir Thomas had the means, status, and skills to unnerve both those in power and those who sought power. Further, he and his family, the &#145;great&#146; Arundells of Lanherne, remained devoted to traditional religion. In a volatile political and religious climate he could not avoid being embroiled in the continual struggle for control of the government, and was a vulnerable target for those who feared his prominent status and opposed his religious beliefs. Consequently, vague and unproven suggestions of complicity in the 1549 south-western rebellion were directed at him and his brother. Those accusations led to the imprisonment of both men in 1550 and again in 1551, and marked the end of Sir Thomas's career. His temporary alignment with the duke of Somerset in late 1551 then made him a victim of the earl of Warwick's putsch. Arundell was arrested and charged with conspiring both to overthrow the government and to murder the earl. Warwick's government undoubtedly coerced the inquest into making a conviction. Arundell consistently professed his innocence.<br>
<br>During Somerset's protectorate Arundell was not an ambitious power seeker. He was an intelligent and experienced politician with decades of proven loyalty to the Tudor crown; though he had ample opportunity, there was no hint of a dangerously ambitious man. His loyalty to the king remained intact. However, he was embroiled in circumstances beyond his control, and his political and religious status played against him in a struggle that he lost. He was beheaded on Tower Hill on 26 February 1552 and buried in the church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. His property was swiftly confiscated, but in June 1552 the crown began its restoration to his widow and, from 1553, to his children.<br>
