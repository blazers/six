<span class="headword">Clare,  Bogo  de</span>  (1248&#150;1294), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and figure of scandal</span>, was born on 21 July 1248, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5448/', "Richard de Clare, earl of Gloucester and Hertford (1222&#150;1262)")</script>, and his second wife, Maud (<i>d</i>. 1288/9), daughter of John de Lacy, earl of Lincoln. As a younger son he was intended for the church from a very early age. His father secured a dispensation for him to hold two livings, and also presented him to the church of Callan, Kilkenny, in May 1255, when Bogo was not yet seven; he became a papal chaplain in the same year. By 1257 he was studying in Oxford, and stayed there until at least November 1259, living in some style, thanks to royal gifts of venison and firewood. The pattern of his early years, of advancement through family patronage, along paths that were further smoothed by links with the court, was to be maintained for the rest of his life, above all in his ecclesiastical career, as he built up the collection of benefices for which he became notorious.<br>
<br>In 1283 Archbishop Wickwane (<i>d</i>. 1285) of York demanded that Bogo de Clare be ordained priest. There is no evidence that he complied, but he continued to add to his assemblage of churches and offices, acquiring his twentieth living during that year. It is not easy to tell exactly how many benefices Bogo held during his career, since he resigned some and exchanged others, but the most reliable estimate suggests that the rectorships of thirty-one churches, or parts of churches, came into his hands between 1255 and 1294, giving him a stake in all but four of the dioceses of England. He also held prebends in the cathedrals of Exeter, Wells, Lichfield, Chichester (where he was precentor), Llandaff (where he was chancellor), and York, where in 1285 he became treasurer. Claims on other livings could not be substantiated, notwithstanding a taste for litigation which in 1282 earned him a rebuke from Archbishop John Pecham&#151;a dispute over the Yorkshire church of Adlingfleet, to which he was presented by his mother in 1268, lasted for nearly twenty years, and ended in Bogo's defeat. An absentee pluralist on a grand scale, he farmed out his livings, usually for much more than their nominal value, and supervised them through agents. His cathedral offices he usually exercised through deputies, who seem to have been under no supervision at all. In 1283 or 1284 the dean and chapter of York complained to him about the behaviour of the men he had deputed to perform the functions of treasurer there, of their negligence, violence, and misuse of minster furnishings, but their employer took no notice, and seldom if ever visited York in person.<br>
<br>Bogo de Clare was clearly <i>persona grata</i> at court, able to extract favours from both Henry III and Edward I, and apparently a friend of Eleanor of Castile; in 1291, shortly after her death, Edward I pardoned Bogo 200 marks of queen's gold &#145;in consideration of the good affection that the queen bore towards him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1288&#150;1296</span>, 158). But his closest links were with his own family, for which he was even prepared to risk offending the king. When his sister Margaret fell out with her husband, the king's cousin Edmund, earl of Cornwall, Bogo tried to negotiate a reconciliation, and, when that failed, had a writ served on Edmund as he made his way to a meeting of the king's council, citing him to appear in the archbishop of Canterbury's court. Edward I was furious, and Bogo was remanded to the Tower of London, but bought his way out with a fine of 2000 marks to the king (later reduced to 1000 marks), and &pound;100 to the earl. He used his position as chancellor of Llandaff, too, to his family's advantage, between 1287 and 1294 consistently thwarting efforts to install a bishop in that see where his brother, the earl of Gloucester, wanted no episcopal rival.<br>
<br>But it is hard to feel that Bogo de Clare often thought of anybody save himself. Neglecting his churches, he spent much time in London, probably in a house near Holy Trinity, Aldgate, or moving around the home counties. His wardrobe accounts show that he lived well, regularly outspending his income in the process. He bought wine and cloth from Gascon and Italian merchants, purchased considerable quantities of meat, fish, and spices, and entertained lavishly. His guests included members of the court and aristocracy, and also several justices and exchequer clerks, who might be given gold rings or silver goblets. Consistently stingy with alms, which he doled out in sums much smaller than the 12<i>d</i>. that he regularly paid for washing his head, he maintained a substantial household, on some days paying wages to twenty-seven grooms and three pages, and employing several clerks. His servants were capable of showing a violent loyalty to him&#151;on a notorious occasion in 1290 they compelled one of the archbishop of Canterbury's clerks to eat the summons he had attempted to serve on their lord&#151;but Bogo did not always respond in kind; his steward Walter de Reygni was harried for two years in the exchequer of pleas for money and jewels for which he had already accounted. Bogo de Clare died suddenly in October 1294. His passing was noticed by several chroniclers, always unfavourably. The Worcester annalist commented that &#145;God only knows if his life was worthy of praise, but no-one thought it worthy of imitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 4.517); his verdict, on a singularly unedifying representative of the medieval English church, is one that posterity has never looked likely to reverse.<br>
