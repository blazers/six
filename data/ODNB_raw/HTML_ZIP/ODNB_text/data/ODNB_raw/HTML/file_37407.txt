<span class="headword">Fairbank,  Alfred John</span>  (1895&#150;1982), <span class="occ">calligrapher</span>, was born on 12 July 1895 in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, the elder of the two sons of Alfred John Fairbank (1868&#150;1953), engine fitter, and his wife, Emma Greetham (1863&#150;1929), a Salvation Army officer. His parents moved to Gillingham, Kent, when his father became a chargeman of engine fitters in Chatham Dockyard. He was educated at the Wesleyan higher grade school, Gillingham, and at Chatham Dockyard school.<br>
<br>When fifteen Fairbank joined the dockyard as a boy writer. It was a modest beginning to a career culminating in the rank of senior executive officer, but it was a family triumph in 1911. Competition for civil service entry was stiff: success depended on good handwriting. Thus Fairbank developed the interest and skill which led the first Baron Bridges to write of him when seventy &#145;No man of our time has done more for good handwriting, whether for the individual or the community, than Alfred Fairbank&#146;  (Osley, ix). On 2 April 1919 he married Elsie (1893&#150;1987), daughter of George Kneeshaw, master bricklayer. They had one son, John, a chartered civil engineer, and one daughter, who died as an infant in 1922.<br>
<br>A dockyard colleague introduced Fairbank to the arts and crafts movement and calligraphy. William Morris was especially influential through his manuscript books and his copies of italic writing manuals. Transfer to the Admiralty enabled him in 1920 to attend evening classes in writing and illuminating at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London. He met Edward Johnston who came to regard him highly and whose seminal book, <span class="italic">Writing and Illuminating and Lettering</span> (1906), stimulated his study of Renaissance handwriting and of palaeography&#151;the inspiration for the italic script and type associated with his name.<br>
<br>In the inter-war years Fairbank established a reputation in both calligraphy and type design. Notable examples were his text in roman script of <span class="italic">Ecclesiasticus</span> (1929) and his type design, narrow Bembo italic (1928). A founding member of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators (SSI), he became honorary secretary in 1931 and its first president twenty years later. After 1945 his fame as a calligrapher grew, marked by the success of <span class="italic">A Book of Scripts</span>, the Penguin book of the year in 1949. He was appointed CBE in 1951. During his twelve years as SSI president (1951&#150;63) he completed the best-known of his many calligraphy projects, the design and direction of the RAF book of remembrance at St Clement Danes, London.<br>
<br>Fairbank's contribution to handwriting made him known to a larger public. In 1932 the Dryad Press published <span class="italic">A Handwriting Manual</span> and also his writing cards for schools. The <span class="italic">Beacon Writing Books</span>, a collaborative work with Charlotte Stone and Winifred Hooper, followed after the Second World War. The adoption of the italic script by many schools and a wider interest in the reform of handwriting encouraged him to initiate the founding of the Society for Italic Handwriting in 1952, with a director of education, Joseph Compton, as chairman; it soon had more than 500 members. Fairbank's later books included <span class="italic">Renaissance Handwriting: an Anthology of Italic Scripts</span>, with Berthold Wolpe (1960), <span class="italic">A Roman Script for Schools</span> (1961), and <span class="italic">The Story of Handwriting</span> (1970).<br>
<br>Fairbank's personality reflected wide cultural interests and a gift for friendship. He was an influential figure in the field of calligraphy&#151;tall and spare, exacting and conservative in his craft, but with a sense of humour and a love of beauty which his colleagues and pupils relished. His fame may, however, rest primarily on his own writing and texts as a scholar penman. He described handwriting as a &#145;dance of the pen&#146;: so it was when he himself wrote.<br>
<br>Fairbank retired from the Admiralty to Hove. He died on 14 March 1982 at 4 Preston Park Avenue, Brighton. His remains were cremated on the 18th at Woodvale, Brighton, and his ashes scattered on Ditchling Beacon, Sussex, on 10 April.<br>
