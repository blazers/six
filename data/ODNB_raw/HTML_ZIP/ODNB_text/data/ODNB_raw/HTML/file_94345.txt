<span class="headword">Hopcraft,  Arthur Edward</span>  (1932&#150;2004), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 29 November 1932 at 60 High Street, Shoeburyness, Essex, the youngest of three children of Arthur Hopcraft, grocer, and his wife, Bertha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bates, both from Fritwell, Oxfordshire. When he was a small boy the family moved to the mining village of Blackfords, near Cannock, Staffordshire, where his father managed a bread and grocery store. With a brother and a sister, respectively seven years and a year and a half older, they formed a close, respectable lower middle-class family. They were &#145;Methodist, and prominently so&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Great Apple Raid</span>, 5): his father was a lay preacher and Sunday school teacher. He grew up amid the poverty and grime of industrial Staffordshire, attending the local primary school with the sons of miners who told him &#145;yo talk posh&#146;  (ibid., 9). From the start football was a passion, the best way to make friends and find a way of belonging. His love of the game continued through his isolated adolescence as a scholarship boy at the rugby-playing King Edward VI Grammar School, Lichfield.<br>
<br>From school Hopcraft went straight into the local paper, the <span class="italic">Stafford Newsletter</span>. At sixteen he was writing match reports, first watching Stafford Rangers, a team he followed all his life, and then reporting the triumphs of the team he had dreamed of playing for as a child, Wolverhampton Wanderers, now managed by Stan Cullis. From the midlands he went to work in the north-east and then on the <span class="italic">Barnsley Chronicle</span> with the young Michael Parkinson. &#145;He was the first reporter I encountered who wore a bow tie, which took courage in Barnsley in the 1950s&#146;, Parkinson remembered, adding how they both already considered themselves &#145;football writers rather than football reporters&#146;  (A. Hopcraft, <span class="italic">The Football Man</span>, 2006 edn, vii). Hopcraft went on to write for the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> before going freelance in 1964, working for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> with Hugh McIlvanney, with whom he produced books on the 1966 and 1970 world cups, as well as for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, <span class="italic">The Sun</span>, and other papers.<br>
<br>In 1968 Hopcraft published the work that made him famous. <span class="italic">The Football Man: People and Passions in Soccer</span> drew on material he had published in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times Magazine</span>, expanded and reworked. A book of biographical essays, it was mainly devoted to the players themselves, but with sections on managers, directors, referees, fans, and the press. Hopcraft's chief fascination was with the footballers themselves rather than the teams. Written with economy and a judicious empathy, <span class="italic">The Football Man</span> explored the personalities behind the performances and fitted the footballers into their localities and social landscapes, evoking a sport still rooted in the class relations and attitudes of an earlier age now confronting a new world of affluence and media-driven glamour. The description of Stanley Matthews's &#145;sadly impassive face, with its high cheek bones, pale lips and hooded eyes &hellip; a worker's face, like a miner's, never really young, tight against a brutal world even in repose&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Football Man</span>, 29), or of Derek Dooley growing up in Sheffield &#145;where the city meanders in a smoky, greasy straggle of workshops into Rotherham&#146; and learning to play football on &#145;patches of grit and oily grass, hemmed in by the crouched streets&#146;  (ibid., 58) were typical of the style of the book&#151;evocative, deeply felt, and with a command of language that hinted at the creative writing career that was to come.<br>
<br>Also in 1968 Hopcraft published another book, <span class="italic">Born to Hunger</span>, an indictment of third world poverty, and the result of travelling over 45,000 miles in South America, Africa, and Asia on behalf of the United Nations. It was &#145;largely a travel book&#146; about the people he met  (<span class="italic">Born to Hunger</span>, 4), a compelling and painful account of &#145;the physical condition of being underdeveloped&#146;  (ibid.), which was far from &#145;the mild shortage of material comfort which the euphemism suggests&#146;  (ibid., 2). Now set on a career as a writer, in 1970 Hopcraft published a memoir of his early life, <span class="italic">The Great Apple Raid and Other Encounters of a Tin Chapel Tiro</span>, drawing on autobiographical pieces he had written for <span class="italic">Nova</span> magazine. The book sharply catches the scholarship boy's sense of displacement, uneasy in both the pit village and the grammar school, grateful to his parents&#151;the book is dedicated to them&#151;but anxious to get away.<br>
<br>Increasingly claustrophobic, uncomfortable in large crowds, and loathing the London Underground, Hopcraft went to live in rural Derbyshire in 1973. By then he had embarked on a new career as a scriptwriter, having taken up a chance offer to write drama for Granada Television. His first play, <span class="italic">Cyril and the Sex Kittens</span>, was quickly followed by several others, including <span class="italic">The Mosedale Horseshoe</span> (1971), which drew on his fondness for hill walking, and <span class="italic">The Reporters</span> (1972), in which a thrusting young reporter on the way up meets a jaundiced older man on the way down. <span class="italic">The Nearly Man</span> followed a Labour MP's struggle for ministerial power, appeared to critical acclaim in 1974, and was extended to seven episodes the next year. From being a football writer Hopcraft had become a household name in television drama. &#145;Is there any television playwright who can catch Alan Bennett&#146;, wondered the critic Stanley Reynolds in 1978. &#145;Perhaps Arthur Hopcraft might do it. The two have the same still voice, they deal with everyday sort of subjects &hellip; they are unmistakeably English&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Jan 1978).<br>
<br>Just as his life as a dramatist began to flourish Hopcraft's career took a new turn as a screenwriter with a commission from Granada to adapt <span class="italic">Hard Times</span> (1977). Later adaptations included <span class="italic">Bleak House</span> (1985), <span class="italic">A Tale of Two Cities</span> (1989), and <span class="italic">Rebecca</span> (1997). His greatest triumph, however, was John le Carr&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</span> in 1979. Alec Guinness took the part of George Smiley after reading Hopcraft's screenplay, which simplified the complex plot, delighting not only the actors and the audience but the author himself. In 1982 he published his own novel, <span class="italic">Mid-Century Men</span>, which opens with a writer recovering from a hangover in his London home and follows a trail of political corruption in the north-east. <span class="italic">The Times</span> called it &#145;a rich and satisfying first novel&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 March 1982), but he did not pursue novel writing.<br>
<br>As time passed Hopcraft increasingly divided his time between his &#145;semi&#146; in Twickenham and a house near Grasse in Provence, where he could enjoy his love of good food and wine and watch English football thanks to a satellite link. He lived, as Julie Welch observed, &#145;like the surviving half of an elderly couple&#146;; &#145;I've tried both sexes&#146;, he said, &#145;and ended up wishing they would always just go away&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 26 Nov 2004). He was a man who inspired affection and admiration in equal measure and he had a circle of close friends to whom he was deeply attached. Nevertheless his sense of being outside and alone persisted, pushing him in mid-life from the gregariousness of the sports desk into the solitary life of the creative writer. He died, after a heart attack following a kidney infection, at Kingston Hospital, Kingston upon Thames, on 22 November 2004.<br>
