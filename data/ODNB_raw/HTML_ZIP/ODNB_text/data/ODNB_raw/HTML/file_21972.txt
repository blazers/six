<span class="headword">Perkins,  Loftus</span>  (1834&#150;1891), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born on 8 May 1834 in Great Coram Street, London, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21967/', "Angier March Perkins (1799&#150;1881)")</script>, engineer, and his wife, Julia Georgiana Brown. Probably apprenticed in 1848 to his father, in 1853&#150;4 he went to New York to practise on his own account. (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53952/', "Jacob Perkins")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21967/', "Perkins, Angier March")</script>], Loftus's grandfather, had come from New England and the Perkins family was still numerous in that area.) After returning to England he remained with his father until 1862, then spent four years in business at Hamburg and Berlin, designing and executing heating installations for buildings in various parts of the continent. He again returned to England in 1866 and entered into partnership with his father, trading as A. M. Perkins &amp; Son, a style which continued until his father's death.<br>
<br>Perkins inherited his grandfather's inventive brilliance, plus a greater appreciation of the practical difficulties involved in high-pressure engineering. He took out a large number of patents, the first, in 1859, relating to a steam engine designed to operate at 600 lb per square inch. His 1872 patent for gunmetal piston rings was a most important advance for engineering. By 1874 the British army had fifty-six of Perkins's horse-drawn mobile steam ovens to feed troops on the march; these were known to the soldiers as &#145;Polly Perkins&#146;. His commercial baking ovens based on his steam heating system, &#145;the stopped-end tube&#146;, were widely used in bakeries. In 1871&#150;3 Perkins made successful trials with a tractor powered by high-pressure steam, and at the 1873 International Exhibition in London he demonstrated his noiseless road engine which travelled at 8 m.p.h. His 70 ton yacht <i>Anthracite</i>, driven by engines working with steam at 500 lb pressure, travelled across the Atlantic and back in 1880, consuming only 25 tons of coal. In 1883 Mrs Perkins launched the steamship <i>Express</i> on the Thames; 160 feet in length, with a Perkins 800 hp quadruple compound engine and speed of 14 knots, it was licensed to carry 677 passengers on the river and 345 at sea. Many engineers came to inspect it. <i>Express</i> was later sold for midnight sun cruises in Norway, proof that high-pressure steam was both safe and economical.<br>
<br>Perkins's experiments in refrigeration led him to design and patent in 1888 his Arktos cold chamber, suitable for preserving meat and other foodstuffs. It functioned entirely without moving parts or valves by what is now known as the automatic ammonia absorption system. This was his last major achievement, and the long hours through which he nursed it to perfection contributed to the breakdown of his health. Perkins became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1861 and of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1881. His wife, Emily Patton (<i>b</i>. 1837/8), came from New York; their sons Loftus Patton Perkins (<i>b</i>. 1867) and Ludlow Patton Perkins (1872&#150;1928) joined their father in business. The firm passed from family control after Perkins's death and subsequently amalgamated with Joseph Baker, Sons &amp; Co., as Baker Perkins. Perkins died on 27 April 1891 at his home, 148 Abbey Road, Kilburn, London, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 1 May. He was survived by his wife.<br>
