<span class="headword">Willement,  Thomas</span>  (1786&#150;1871), <span class="occ">writer on heraldry and stained-glass artist</span>, was baptized at St Marylebone Church, Marylebone, Middlesex, on 15 August 1786, the son of Thomas Willement, coach, herald, and house painter and artist to his royal highness the duke of York, and his wife, Hariett. His formative years were very likely spent helping in his father's business at 25 Green Street, Grosvenor Square, London&#151;the premises were subsequently leased to him in 1822&#151;where his artistic ability and interest in heraldry would have developed. He married Katherine Griffith (1796&#150;1852), the daughter of Thomas Griffith, master of the Sadlers' Company, some time before 1833. Their son, Arthur Thomas, died at Oxford, on 5 June 1854 in his twenty-first year.<br>
<br>Willement was pre-eminent among a small group of stained-glass artists, who, in the early nineteenth century, utilized the medieval method of making a stained-glass window from separate pieces of coloured glass bound together with lead strips, rather than, as with eighteenth-century artists, using coloured enamels to paint pictures on glass. Where he received his training is not known but his first window, as recorded in his manuscript &#145;Chronological list of the principal works in stained glass&#146; (British Library, London), was made in 1812 for J. T. Trevanion's house, Caerhays, in Cornwall. As with the bulk of his work until the 1840s it was heraldic in character, reflecting an absorbing interest underlined by the publications he produced in the same period, which included: <span class="italic">Regal heraldry: the armorial insignia of the kings and queens of England, from coeval authorities</span> (1821); <span class="italic">Heraldic Notices of Canterbury Cathedral; with Genealogical and Topographical Notes</span> (1827); <span class="italic">Fac simile of a contemporary roll with the names and the arms of the sovereign and of the spiritual and temporal peers who sat in parliament held at Westminster AD1515</span> (1829); and <span class="italic">A Roll of Arms of the Reign of Richard the Second</span> (1834). At some time Willement was appointed heraldic artist to George IV and in 1832 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. According to Clive Wainwright  (Wainwright, 16 Dec 1971, 1716), he was involved with two other members of the society, Henry Shaw and Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, in the publication of <span class="italic">Specimens of Ancient Furniture</span> (1836) and he certainly provided material for one of the plates in Shaw's <span class="italic">Details of Elizabethan Architecture</span> (1839). He had already made windows in 1829, for Meyrick's country house, Goodrich Court, in Herefordshire, a building designed by the architect Edward Blore, someone he was to work with on a number of future occasions, including at St George's Chapel, Windsor, and at Hampton Court Palace. Country houses were to be a significant source of employment. In 1831 when work was completed at Charlecote Park, Warwickshire, for George Lucy, Willement's records noted: &#145;The whole of the ancient stained glass in the windows of the great hall repaired and releaded. Eight additional panels executed to complete the series of descents. Very considerable painted decorations through the whole mansion&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 52413). The following year saw him working with the architect Anthony Salvin at Mamhead in Devon, where he was engaged in plumbing, painting, and stained glass&#151;again he continued the association in later years at Rufford Abbey, Nottinghamshire, Scotney Castle, Kent, and Harlaxton, Lincolnshire&#151;while in 1833 he was at Alton Towers, Staffordshire, supplying windows and decorating the interior for the earl of Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>Royal commissions followed and with them the appellation &#145;artist in stained glass to Queen Victoria&#146;. In 1840 four heraldic windows were ordered for the choir clerestory of St George's Chapel, Windsor&#151;ultimately the work extended to the choir aisles, the Beaufort and Lincoln chapels, and the chapter room, with restorations to heraldic decoration, monuments, and furnishings, all of which took until 1861 to complete&#151;and in 1843 an armorial window for the great hall at Hampton Court. A description of the early work, including the restoration of the great west window at St George's Chapel, was published by Willement in his <span class="italic">An account of the restorations of the collegiate chapel of St George, Windsor, with some particulars of the heraldic ornaments of the edifice</span> (1844). Church windows also came within Willement's compass, examples including: Epsom church, Surrey (1824); St Peter, Hampton Lucy, Warwickshire, (1837); and the cathedral of Barbados (1838).<br>
<br>In 1840 Willement joined A. W. N. Pugin, the driving force behind the revival of the medieval principles of stained-glass design, to make the east window of the Convent of Our Lady of Mercy, Handsworth, Birmingham. Pugin was extremely put out by Willement's &#145;stupid mistake about the hand of the Blessed Virgin&#146;  (Parl. Arch., historical collection No. 339, letter 71) and this perhaps was in his mind when he wrote to Lord Shrewsbury, stressing the control he exercised over the designs for the windows made by Willement in 1841, for the Chapel and School of the Hospital of St John, Alton, Staffordshire: &#145;The figures too are very devotional &amp; well drawn I made full sized drawings of every detail so there is great variety&#146;  (P. Stanton, &#145;Welby Pugin and the Gothic Revival&#146;, PhD thesis, University of London, 1950, appendix 8). Willement's retention in his papers of two of Pugin's sketches  (BL, Add. MS 34873) is perhaps an indication of his regard for the latter's ability and ideas. Pugin, however, tired of the association, wrote to Lord Shrewsbury in February 1842: &#145;I believe that Willement thinks only of making money &hellip; I will never work with Willement again for I have had immense trouble drawn everything out in detail and then at the last he charges twice as much as anybody&#146;  (A. Wedgwood, <span class="italic">Catalogue of Drawings in the Victoria and Albert Museum, A. W. N. Pugin and the Pugin Family</span>, 1985, 105, letter 24).<br>
<br>In 1842 Willement worked on the restoration of the Temple Church in London, together with the architects Sydney Smirke and Decimus Burton. He provided figured medallions on a mosaic ground for the three lancet windows at the east end and ornamental painting for the walls, reredos, and all the vaulting. Although deemed a &#145;memorable restoration&#146; by <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span>  (2.98), the journal of the Cambridge Camden Society, the publication nevertheless made a long list of complaints against the internal arrangements. Willement's work, however, must have given satisfaction, for he was engaged by the society to produce the stained-glass windows for the church of the Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge, which Salvin restored during 1841&#150;3, and in 1845 he carried out the polychrome decoration at Kilndown church, Kent, for the leading ecclesiologist A. J. Beresford-Hope.<br>
<br>That same year, Willement purchased Davington Priory, Faversham, Kent, which was to be his home until his death in 1871. The church and domestic buildings were badly in need of restoration. Willement's contributions included polychromatic painted decoration, stained glass, and designs for encaustic tiles, together with purchases of furniture and fittings, to give an authentic medieval character to the interiors. The restoration is described in his <span class="italic">Historical Sketch of the Parish of Davington, in the County of Kent and of the Priory there</span> (1862). In 1845 he also painted the ceiling of the chapter house at York Minster and the vault of the lady chapel of Wells Cathedral. Additionally, he releaded the centre window of the lady chapel and provided for it several new figures of prophets. Praise for Willement's polychromatic painting of the apses, chancel roof, and aisles and organ of St Mary and St Nicholas, Wilton, Wiltshire, appeared in <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> (November 1846, 173) and in the same and the following year, Willement supplied windows, including the main east window, for R. C. Carpenter's restoration of St Nicholas, Kemerton, Gloucestershire. Willement's prolific output continued into the 1850s and 1860s and included windows for St Luke's, Chelsea; St Lawrence, Ludlow, Shropshire; the continuation of the work at St George's Chapel, Windsor; and other windows and painted decoration at Windsor Castle. His last work, windows and painted decoration for the royal chapel of the Savoy, London, was completed in 1865. He died on 10 March 1871 at Davington Priory, and was buried, six days later, in the sacristy vault of the priory church of St Mary Magdalene.<br>
<br>If Willement led the way, in the nineteenth century, in the design and execution of heraldic stained glass, he was less convincing in his figure windows. Unlike Pugin, who sought to emulate the medieval masters through a complete understanding of their principles of design, Willement adopted an imitative approach, looking to create medieval effects by reproducing directly from ancient models or their likenesses. Nevertheless, he did much to advance the cause of English Gothic revival stained glass, through his influential patrons, the widespread distribution of his works, and the tutelage of two window makers, William Warrington (1786&#150;1869) and Michael O'Connor (1801&#150;1867).<br>
