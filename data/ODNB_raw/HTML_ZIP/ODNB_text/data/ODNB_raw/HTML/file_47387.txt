<span class="headword">Davies,  Francis Thomas</span>  (1906&#150;1988), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and industrialist</span>, was born on 9 December 1906 at 39 Melville Street, Edinburgh, the son of General Sir Francis John Davies (1864&#150;1948) and his wife, Madalen Augusta Lavinia Scott. The family home was Elmley Castle, near Pershore, Worcestershire. He was educated at Broadstairs and at Eton College, which he entered in the lowest form. When he departed his house captain wrote that Davies:<blockquote>was a very good footballer, immensely strong and quite unstoppable when really roused &hellip; He has left rather young to go into an Insurance office. Though not brilliant in work, we feel sure that he will have a great aptitude for persuading people to insure their lives, for his harrowing tales of various deceases [<i>sic</i>] were enough to terrify anyone. (private information, Eton College archivist)</blockquote>Davies worked for different firms in France, Germany, and London before joining Courtaulds Ltd in 1929, where he became a director in 1937, with responsibility for exports and for factories in France and Germany. In September 1938 he wrote to the under-secretary of state for war, volunteering for intelligence work. He was interviewed in the War Office and asked to report on Germany's economic preparations for war. This led to espionage within Germany on behalf of the War Office and section D of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). During 1939 he was drawn into the work of a new War Office department, military intelligence (research), known as MI(R). On 7 August 1940 he married Eileen Cynthia Millicent Eva (<i>b</i>. 1912), daughter of Henry Charles Brougham, third Baron Brougham and Vaux. They had at least one child.<br>
<br>In August 1939, while training with the 1st battalion, Grenadier Guards, Davies was called up from the Territorial Army reserve to serve as a staff officer in the British military mission to Poland. A colleague recalled how Davies &#145;in a Brigade of Guard's tie, stood disapproving and aloof&#146; amid the hearty m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of departing officers at Victoria Station  (Wilkinson, 68). Early in September 1939 General Adrian Carton de Wiart, the head of mission, sent Davies back to Britain with urgent requests for assistance in view of the disastrous situation developing in Poland. Davies left Poland on 5 September in a civil aircraft that was fired at by both Germans and Poles during its journey. On arrival in London he summarized Carton de Wiart's concerns in a report discussed by the chiefs of staff at their meeting on 9 September. Carton de Wiart urgently requested sufficient fighter aircraft to ward off the German medium bombers that prevented the Poles from mustering formations to carry out counter-attacks. Carton de Wiart also wanted light machine-guns and ammunition forwarded immediately before Poland's frontiers were sealed off. Davies reported that &#145;General Carton de Wiart asked me to impress upon everybody I met the absolute urgency for immediate action; there must be no delay&#146;  (Davies). But the concern and energy of Carton de Wiart and Davies could achieve virtually nothing for the Poles in the face of British impotence and inertia.<br>
<br>Davies resumed work for MI(R) and travelled widely to seize objects of economic value in Europe before the Nazis marched in. Perhaps his most notable mission came in May 1940, when he made a hurried trip to Amsterdam and successfully removed or destroyed securities held in the national bank. Later in 1940 staff from MI(R) were absorbed into a new organization, the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Labour minister Hugh Dalton was chairman; he chose Sir Frank Nelson as his executive director and was given Gladwyn Jebb, by the Foreign Office, as chief executive officer. In his diary entry for 25 July Dalton noted that he saw Davies, &#145;who makes a good impression on me &hellip; [he] says there has been a lack of drive and direction. He obviously wants me to begin to supply these deficiencies&#146;  (<span class="italic">War Diary</span>, 65). Davies joined SOE on 23 September 1940 as personal assistant to Nelson, with the remit of advising his chief on SOE's resources of staff and supplies. On 12 October he completed a report on training that established a programme for the provision of schools. His plan envisaged four stages: preliminary schools, where agents would be assessed without taking them very far into the secrets of the organization; paramilitary schools; finishing schools, which were to teach subversive warfare and would hold agents until required for operations; and lastly the final briefing of agents in London flats.<br>
<br>Davies was the first to see the need for SOE representation in America. This was duly achieved through the British security co-ordination (BSC), under Sir William Stephenson, established in December 1940 to represent British intelligence in North America. BSC became important as a source of supplies, recruits, and training facilities for SOE&#151;matters at the core of Davies's role in the organization. In September 1941 Davies visited the USA for discussions with Colonel Donovan, head of the office for strategic services (OSS), the new American organization for subversion and espionage overseas. This crucial meeting established friendly relations and the basis for a relatively free exchange of information and facilities between SOE and OSS. Davies committed SOE to establishing a school in Canada to train both British and American personnel, and in return Donovan promised SOE supplies of materials and staff. In autumn 1941 Davies became director of research and supply, and held that post until the end of his SOE career. It gave him considerable influence behind the scenes, not least during the SOE palace revolution of 1942. In February of that year Lord Wolmer succeeded Dalton as minister for SOE, and the involuntary departure of Gladwyn Jebb soon followed. Dalton believed that Davies threw his weight in the scales against Jebb, who was resented by some SOE staff due to a tactless deployment of superior intellect&#151;an unfortunate trait that he shared with Dalton. In contrast, according to one contemporary, &#145;Davies didn't have much upstairs&#146;  (private information). Indeed he was a man of action rather than an intellectual, and so worked easily with the business and military men who formed the core of SOE. He was appraised by Colin Gubbins as &#145;an officer of great drive and personality, most efficient in his duties. He has any amount of initiative and willingly accepts responsibility &hellip; An outstanding officer&#146;  (private information, SOE adviser). Davies's work for SOE was not as adventurous as his earlier role in MI(R); rather, he played a vital part in strengthening the logistics of a new and sometimes chaotic organization. This was the most important contribution that he made during a life that was vigorous, versatile, and effective.<br>
<br>In May 1945 Davies left SOE and returned to the business world. He rejoined the board of Courtaulds and, together with its chairman, Sir John Hanbury-Williams, was largely responsible for re-establishing its prestige overseas, especially in the USA. From 1948 he spent much of his time in the United States, overseeing projects there. At Courtaulds he was always referred to as Colonel Davies; he has been described by the company's historian as &#145;a vigorous and assertive man who liked issuing orders and getting things done&#146;  (Coleman, 88) and had a reputation for plunging in without thinking a problem out. An overseas business acquaintance described him as &#145;tr&egrave;s bousculant&#146;  (ibid.). Ill health forced him to resign from Courtaulds in January 1954 but he later served as a director of Gulf Oil (GB) and as chairman of British Enkalon. He died on 8 September 1988 at his home, Hill House Farm, Elmley Castle.<br>
