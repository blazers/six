<span class="headword">Low,  David</span>  (1786&#150;1859), <span class="occ">agricultural economist</span>, was born on 25 November 1786, probably at Woodend, Berwickshire, the eldest son of Alexander Low, land agent, of Laws, Berwickshire, and his wife, Susan Anderson. He was educated at Perth Academy and the University of Edinburgh. He assisted his father on his farms, and soon showed special aptitude as a land agent and valuer. In 1817 he published <span class="italic">Observations on the present state of landed property, and on the prospects of the landholder and the farmer</span>, dealing with the slump which followed the battle of Waterloo (1815). In 1825 he settled in Edinburgh, and in the following year the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Agriculture</span> was established at his suggestion; he edited it from 1828 to 1832.<br>
<br>On the death of Professor Andrew Coventry in 1831 Low was appointed professor of agriculture in the University of Edinburgh. His first step was to urge on the government the necessity of forming an agricultural museum, for which the chancellor of the exchequer, Thomas Spring-Rice, consented in 1833 to allow &pound;300 a year. Low also contributed collections of his own, and employed the artist William Shiels to travel, taking portraits of the best specimens of different breeds of animals. Altogether &pound;3000 was expended on the museum&#151;&pound;1500 from the government, &pound;300 from the Reid fund, and the rest from the professor's private resources. The museum led to increased attendance in the class of agriculture.<br>
<br>In 1834 Low published <span class="italic">Elements of Practical Agriculture</span> (4th edn, 1843); it was translated into French and German. In 1842 he brought out a splendid work in two volumes, <span class="italic">The Breeds of the Domestic Animals of the British Islands</span>, with coloured plates. This was translated for the French government immediately on its appearance. Two years later he published <span class="italic">On Landed Property and the Economy of Estates</span>, and in 1850 an <span class="italic">Appeal to the Common Sense of the Country Regarding the Condition of the Working Classes</span>. He was also much devoted to chemistry and had a private laboratory. His controversial work <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature of the Simple Bodies of Chemistry</span> (1844) suggested that carbon and hydrogen were the only fundamental chemical elements, and opposed the atomic theory of John Dalton. It provoked a reply from J. J. Berzelius.<br>
<br>Low resigned his chair in 1854, and died, unmarried, at Mayfield, Edinburgh on 7 January 1859. He was buried at the Edinburgh cemetery, Warriston.<br>
