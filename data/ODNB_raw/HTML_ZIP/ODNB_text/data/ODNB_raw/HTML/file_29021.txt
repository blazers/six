<span class="headword">Wells,  William Frederick</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1764, <em>d.</em> 1836), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was baptized at Chislehurst, Kent, on 24 April 1764, the son of William Wells (<i>d</i>. in or after 1815) and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1815). He was educated at Robert Harper's school in Queen Anne Street, London&#151;premises later owned by J. M. W. Turner&#151;and by the age of eleven he was being taught drawing by either John James Barralet or his brother John Melchior Barralet. Wells married his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1807), about 1786 and lived for a period in Northampton, where four of his nine children (three sons and six daughters) were born; two children died in infancy. By 1795 he had returned to London and was living at 34 Mount Street. In 1796 he published <span class="italic">A New and Compendious Treatise of Anatomy</span>, &#145;designed principally for &hellip; ladies&#146;. A set of studies of female heads, by Wells, was engraved by George Townley Stubbs in 1800; between 1802 and 1805 Wells and the artist John Laporte made a series of seventy-two etchings after drawings by Thomas Gainsborough; and about 1809&#150;10 Wells etched the Revd Joseph Wilkinson's views of the Lake District.<br>
<br>Wells was a successful drawing-master; his pupils included two of the daughters of the duke of Clarence (later William IV). In 1792 a former pupil, Robert Ker Porter, introduced Wells to Turner, who was then aged about seventeen, and the two became intimate friends. Wells's daughter Clara recalled: &#145;Turner loved my father with a son's affection&#151;to me he was an elder brother&#146;  (Hamilton, 41). It was Wells who, in 1806, suggested to Turner the idea for the <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span>, which Turner began at the cottage that Wells owned at Knockholt in Kent. Wells travelled extensively, his pictures including English, Scottish, and Welsh scenes; after the peace of Amiens, in 1802, which made it possible to travel abroad again, he went on a sketching tour of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, an undertaking which was exceptional at the time.<br>
<br>Wells was &#145;a sound though not brilliant painter&#146;  (Hardie, 3.132); his drawings were nearly all landscapes in the tradition of Claude, and show a feeling for nature but his work is marred by poorly drawn figure groups. The Victoria and Albert Museum holds four of his works, two signed W. F. Wells. Wells is more significant as the instigator, in 1804, of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96320', "Society of Painters in Water Colours")</script>, which he founded in an effort to raise the status of watercolour painting, since drawings in the medium were poorly presented at Royal Academy exhibitions. He served from 1806 to 1807 as its second president, but resigned from the society in 1813, when its exhibition began to include oil paintings. In all Wells exhibited ninety-one pictures with the society (thirty-seven of Scandinavian scenes) and, between 1795 and 1813, forty-two drawings at the Royal Academy. His pictures were priced from 2 to 15 guineas.<br>
<br>In 1813 Wells was appointed the first drawing-master for the East India Company's cadets at Addiscombe College, near Croydon in Surrey; it was said that he had difficulty in controlling his students. Portraits of Wells from middle age show a round-faced, genial man, clean-shaven, his domed head nearly bald. The Italian poet Ugo Foscolo wrote that he had seen Wells in a blue overcoat, <i>habill&eacute; en dandy</i>  (Wheeler, <span class="italic">Old Water-Colour Society</span>, 1971, 18). Highly hospitable, Wells frequently hosted parties, often fancy dress ones. The Revd Robert Finch recorded in his diary that he had &#145;Conversed upon the subject of <span class="roman">Twelfth Night</span> at Wells's. He [Wells] will support the characters of a Chinese Mandarin, Mr. Noodle or Doodle, and a Beau of Fashion&#146;  (Wheeler, <span class="italic">Old Water-Colour Society</span>, 1971, 14). Wells also gave music lessons and played the piano and the &#145;harmonica&#146; (or musical glasses).<br>
<br>Wells moved from 33 York Buildings to a house on Mitcham Common in 1819. In 1829 he was commissioned by Finch to do a series of drawings of English scenery (now mostly lost), and in 1832 he made a sketching tour of Jersey. He died, at his home, on 16 November 1836 and was buried in Mitcham churchyard. To the elder of his sons he left only 5<i>s</i>. and the hope &#145;that he would see the error of his ways&#146;; each of Wells's three surviving daughters was bequeathed &pound;100 by Turner on his death in 1851.<br>
