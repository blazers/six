<span class="headword">Bowle,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1637), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born in Lancashire. His father, Richard Bowle (<i>d</i>. 1626), auditor to the earl of Bedford, settled at Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where his wife, Marie, died in 1607. John was sent to Westminster School; from there he was elected head of his year to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1593, matriculating and becoming a scholar in 1594. He graduated BA in 1598 and proceeded MA in 1601, BD in 1608, and DD in 1613, incorporating at Oxford in 1605 and 1615. He became chaplain to Lord Treasurer Salisbury, whose last illness in 1612 he attended and chronicled, and was rector of St Michael-le-Querne, London, from 1 March 1608, vacating by 2 April 1619. On 1 June 1609 he was dispensed to hold additionally the rectory of Upminster, Essex. He acquired the Berkshire rectories of Bradfield and Tilehurst in 1613, and that of Eynsford, Kent, in 1614.<br>
<br>From 1610 Bowle was a regular Lent preacher at court, and in 1615 and 1616 published sermons preached respectively at the funeral of Henry Grey, earl of Kent, and at the request of Sir Richard Blount. His appointment as dean of Salisbury was known by 20 March 1620; he was instituted on 28 July. That September he was a royal chaplain-in-waiting, and the following year published an address to the convocation of Canterbury. Advancement to the see of Rochester was predicted on 16 November 1629; Bowle having meanwhile successfully petitioned to retain Tilehurst, assent was given to his election on 8 January 1630 and he was consecrated on 7 February.<br>
<br>During Bowle's first summer as bishop he was forced by plague to vacate the episcopal seat at Bromley, retreating to Berkshire. In 1631 and 1632 he sat frequently in the court of high commission. Concerned at this time to maintain clerical control of church furnishings, he warned that provision of church seating would &#145;hatche a lay presbyterye&#146;  (Gardiner, 307), although his father had made just such improvements to Chesham church. Bishop Bowle promoted the erection of altar rails but he was a resolute protestant, to whom the pope was &#145;vicar of hell&#146;  (ibid., 227). The papal agent Panzani judged him &#145;puritanissimo&#146;  (Albion, 414). In October 1632 it was rumoured that Bowle would be translated to Lichfield. He preached at Archbishop Abbot's funeral at Croydon on 3 September 1633. He was prompt to commend the 1633 reissue of the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>, and suspended clergy who would not read it, but told Laud later that year that his visitation of Rochester Cathedral had been impeded by the dean and chapter on a technicality. The remaining years of his episcopate were inactive through illness, described by Laud as &#145;palsy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.324, 345). One Edward Parsons repeatedly abused him as &#145;a sot&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1631&#150;3</i>, 460, 467).<br>
<br>Bowle and his wife, Bridget, sister of Sir George Coppin, had several children including Richard and Mary, and probably also George, Brigitt, and Anne, buried at Chesham within a fortnight in 1614. Bowle promoted his nephew Richard Chase to two of the richest livings in his diocese, later regretting his generosity. He died in London on 9 October 1637 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
