<span class="headword">Butler <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ramsay]</span>,  Agnata Frances</span>  (1867&#150;1931), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 28 January 1867 at 13 Upper Seymour Street, Marylebone, London, the third and youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35662/', "Sir James Henry Ramsay, tenth baronet (1832&#150;1925)")</script>, of Bamff, historian, and his first wife, Elizabeth Mary Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1868), daughter of William Scott-Kerr of Sunlaws. She was brought up in Perthshire in a distinguished family of Scottish academics, her uncle George Ramsay holding the chair of humanity at Glasgow in succession to his uncle, William Ramsay. Educated at St Leonards School, St Andrews, in which her father took a particular interest, she went to Girton College, Cambridge, in 1884.<br>
<br>Agnata Ramsay was remembered for her remarkable tripos result in 1887. Women students were officially allowed to enter the university examinations only in 1881, following the success of another Girtonian, Charlotte Angas Scott (1858&#150;1931), who had been ranked as equal to the eighth wrangler in the mathematical tripos in 1880 (her scripts having been informally marked &#145;by courtesy&#146;). Agnata Ramsay was therefore among the first generation of women students at Cambridge to take the classical tripos, and her achievement in being placed in division one of the first class in 1887 was unequalled by any man in that year. But for her gender, she would have received the accolade of senior classic. <span class="italic">Punch</span> marked her supremacy with a famous cartoon in which Mr Punch ushered a gowned female into a first-class railway compartment labelled Ladies Only with the text &#145;Honour to Agnata Frances Ramsay&#146;  (2 July 1887). She, and those who followed her, such as Phillipa Fawcett of Newnham College, who was placed above the senior wrangler in 1890, and Margaret Alford (<i>b</i>. 1868) of Girton, who, also in 1890, was bracketed with the senior classic, demonstrated that women could benefit from Cambridge and were entitled to be admitted to the same courses and examinations as men.<br>
<br>Agnata Ramsay subsequently disproved the then commonly held contention that women who undertook rigorous academic study would be unattractive to potential husbands. Remaining in Cambridge to work on an edition of Herodotus, she &#145;captured&#146; the master of Trinity College, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32213/', "Henry Montagu Butler (1833&#150;1918)")</script>, a widower of fifty-seven whom she had met in November 1887 at a production of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Oedipus Rex</span>. They married on 9 August 1888. He claimed &#145;It is her goodness, not her Greek and Latin, which have stolen my heart&#146;, but on their honeymoon they &#145;read a great deal of Greek together&#146;  (Butler, 30, 32). Marrying the master of Trinity at the age of twenty-one, she stepped at once into the demanding role of the leading hostess in Cambridge. For thirty years, in spite of her retiring disposition, she fulfilled the heavy duties expected of her with poise and dignity. She bore three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30884/', "James Ramsay Montagu Butler")</script> (later regius professor of modern history at Cambridge) in 1889, Gordon in 1891, and Nevile in 1893. The publication of her edition of the seventh book of Herodotus' <span class="italic">History</span> in the same year as the birth of her first son provoked a further <span class="italic">Punch</span> cartoon, punning on &#145;a crib for Herodotus&#146;  (7 Dec 1889). After her husband's death in 1918 she remained in Cambridge, where she played an active part in the life of the local Christian Science church, which she had helped to found. Agnata Butler died at Sunny Lodge, Mount Park, Harrow, Middlesex, on 27 May 1931.<br>
