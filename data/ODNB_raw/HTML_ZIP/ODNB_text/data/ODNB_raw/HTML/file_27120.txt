<span class="headword">Temple, Sir  Thomas</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1614, <em>d.</em> 1674), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and baptized there on 10 January 1614, the second son of Sir John Temple of Stanton Bury, Buckinghamshire, and his first wife, Dorothy Lee (<i>d</i>. 1625). A member of a prestigious but chronically indebted gentry family, he fought as an officer on the parliamentary side during the civil war, although he claimed after the Restoration that he disapproved of the imprisonment of Charles I and had participated in efforts to set the king free.<br>
<br>During the interregnum a family connection with William Fiennes, Viscount Saye and Sele, was crucial in gaining for Temple and two partners a Cromwellian grant of &#145;the Contrie and Territories called Laccady and that part of the Country Called Nova Scotia&#146;, recently captured from the French, by patent dated 9 August 1656  (TNA: PRO, CO 1/13, no. 11). Temple was named to govern Nova Scotia and set out in 1657 for Boston, where he would in fact reside for most of the rest of his life, with only occasional visits to Nova Scotia, as in the spring and summer of 1659, and London. The seeming grandeur of his position and pretensions was, in reality, a poor disguise for the fragility of his circumstances, and he faced serious rivals for both the contested territory and the trade of Acadia, or Nova Scotia. The fiction of English control was based on a superficial conquest of Acadian settlements in 1654, and the population remained overwhelmingly American Indian, while the small colonial presence consisted mainly of Acadian French. French military and diplomatic rejoinders, while intermittent, always posed a threat, while rivals also existed in England, especially during the two years immediately following the Restoration. Temple had returned to London by February 1662 to defend his interests, and there secured elevation to the rank of baronet on 7 July 1662 and a new proprietary grant with a royal commission as governor of the notional colony.<br>
<br>Temple then returned to Boston to enjoy for a few more years whatever proceeds he could realize from the Acadian fur trade, offset by an annual payment of &pound;600 by which a powerful English rival had to be bought off. Trading arrangements had depended on English investors, for whom he initially acted as a glorified agent. In New England, however, his commercial na&iuml;vety contrasted with the acumen of the Boston merchants, who were glad to use his English connections for their own profit. Advancing him loans, the merchants used their status as his creditors to lay claim to consignments of furs, the principal commodity yielded by the Nova Scotia trade. By about 1667 a succinct contemporary verdict of his position was that &#145;T. Temple dwells idly at Boston and is fooled by them&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 1/21, no. 174).<br>
<br>Temple also bore the expense of defending Nova Scotia during the Anglo-French war of 1666&#150;7, and suffered a disastrous blow when the crown agreed by the treaty of Breda 1667 to restore the territory to France. He delayed the hand-over effectively enough that he was reportedly described by Charles II, to a French diplomat, as &#145;un coquin&#146;, a rogue  (Colbert de Terron to Louis XIV, 24 Jan 1669, Archives du Minist&egrave;re des Affaires &Eacute;trang&egrave;res, correspondance politique, Angleterre, 94, fols. 28&#150;9), but surrendered his interests in 1670. In Boston he had become a substantial property owner and a prominent member of the Congregational North Church. For the puritan divine Cotton Mather, Temple was &#145;as fine a Gentleman as ever set foot on the American strand&#146;  (Mather, 103). Now, however, he was harassed by creditors and had to sell off his properties. He eventually returned to London, where he died on 27 March 1674, leaving an insolvent estate. He was buried the next day at Ealing, Middlesex. Temple's efforts to rescue his persistently chaotic financial affairs had seemed to be verging on success by 1666, but ultimately fell victim to the characteristic uncertainties of imperial enterprise in the disputed territories of north-eastern North America.<br>
