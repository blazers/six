<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thompson,  Edward Palmer</span>  (1924&#150;1993), <span class="occ">historian, writer, and political activist</span>, was born at Boars Hill, Oxford, on 3 February 1924, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36487/', "Edward John Thompson (1886&#150;1946)")</script>, teacher and writer, and his wife, Theodosia Jessup (1892&#150;1970).<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandeducationto1948"></a>Childhood and education to 1948</h2>At the time of E. P. Thompson's birth (he was often known by his initials), his father taught Bengali at Oxford University, having returned to England in the previous year from west Bengal, where he had been a Methodist missionary. Far removed from the stereotype of the proselytizing Christian missionary, Edward John Thompson's life was pervaded by unresolved contradictions and tensions. A Methodist by birth, upbringing, vocation, and education, he was in most respects an instinctive humanist and believer in the possibility of human betterment. Unable completely to shake off the legacy of paternalism in British India, E. J. Thompson nevertheless became&#151;as did his wife&#151;a strong critic of imperialism. Leading Indian intellectuals were among his friends. These included the Nobel prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore, of whom he was a translator, and the rising politician Jawaharlal Nehru, whom E. P. Thompson remembered as a visitor to the family home. To E. P. Thompson the ambiguities of his father's intellectual positions became of great interest, and at the end of his own life he published <span class="italic">Alien Homage: Edward Thompson and Rabindranath Tagore</span> (1993). He especially remembered from his youth the general atmosphere and tone which stemmed from his parents' radical-Liberal rejection of imperialism and which passed to him the belief that governments were &#145;mendacious and imperialist&#146; and that &#145;one's stance ought to be hostile to government&#146;  (Merrill, 11). He persisted in that belief and stance throughout his life.<br>
<br>Edward and his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75593/', "(William) Frank Thompson (1920&#150;1944)")</script>, attended the highly regarded Dragon preparatory school in Oxford. Frank went on to become a star pupil at Winchester College, but Edward was enrolled at his father's old school, the Methodist-founded Kingswood School, near Bath. He left little comment on experiences there, although the harsh attack on Methodists in his best-known book suggests that Kingswood did nothing to attract him to the church of his father and grandfather. In fact the Kingswood regime in Thompson's time there was remarkably open. Under the headship of A. B. Sackett, wide-ranging debate on political and cultural matters was characteristic. Thompson recalled that as a sixth former in 1940, reading the early work on the English civil war of the Marxist historian Christopher Hill and the seventeenth-century Leveller writings to which it led him, was a &#145;breakthrough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essential E. P. Thompson</span>, 491). At eighteen he followed the example of his brother and joined the Communist Party.<br>
<br>At that age too Thompson began his military service with the army in north Africa and Italy, becoming a tank commander and taking part in the battle of Cassino in 1944. Although his own war experiences were significant, a greater impact on Thompson was made by his brother's death. Frank, a brilliant linguist, was recruited by the Special Operations Executive and dropped into Bulgaria to work with the partisans. Captured by the fascist government, he was shot along with the men he was leading. Frank's vision of a united socialist Europe stayed powerfully with Edward. After visiting Bulgaria with his mother, he wrote with her <span class="italic">There is a Spirit in Europe: a Memoir of Major Frank Thompson</span> (1947). His brother's vision fed into Edward's own later persistent political imagining of European possibilities: in his despising, for example, of the narrowing concept of Europe represented by the European Common Market (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 27 August 1975). His last vigorous political commitment was to European Nuclear Disarmament, of which he was a founder, with its aim of bridging the peace movements of eastern and western Europe. The official obstruction and evasion which he encountered when he tried after the war to find out the truth about his brother's mission reinforced his lifelong suspicion of the power of the &#145;secret state&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Afterthewar19461956"></a>After the war, 1946&#150;1956</h2>Late in 1945 Thompson returned to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, to complete the history degree he had started in 1942. Wartime regulations allowed him his BA on a two-year part one. His first-class result brought him a scholarship with which he was able to finance a third year of extensive individual study of literature, which was probably then his first love. When he entered on his first teaching post, he taught both literature and history.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Thompson re-joined the Communist Party, his formal membership having lapsed during the war. In the party there he met Dorothy Katharine Gane Towers [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103564/', "Thompson, Dorothy (1923&#150;2011)")</script>], who was completing her history degree after war service in industry. She and Edward began to live together in 1945 and married on 16 December 1948. Until ended by Edward's death, it was a remarkable partnership of almost fifty years. The Thompsons then had no inclination to pursue academic careers, and had already decided to move to the north of England, when Edward was offered a teaching post in the extra-mural department at Leeds University. Before taking up this post he and Dorothy had been involved with a volunteer international youth group in building a railway in Yugoslavia, another reinforcement of an internationalism that remained essential in his thinking, and which qualifies overdone attempts to portray him as a quintessentially English radical. The Thompsons moved to Halifax in 1948, shortly before their eldest son, Ben, was born. They lived there for seventeen years, and two more children, Mark and Kate, were born.<br>
<br>Thompson was perhaps fortunate to secure a post when doors were being closed against known communists. He did not see eye to eye on many things with the head of the department, S. G. Raybould, a noted writer on adult education with strong ideas of his own, but from all accounts Thompson was a successful teacher. Departmental records show him to have been committed and thoughtful, expecting a significant input from his students, many of whom were from working-class backgrounds. In later interviews several remembered him as an inspirational teacher. Thompson, in turn, felt that he had much to learn from the life experiences of his working-class students. The whole tone of his most celebrated work, <span class="italic">The Making of the English Working Class</span> (1963), which made his reputation, testifies to this. It was fittingly dedicated to one of these students, and for all its international success it is impossible not to sense that the audience he felt himself to be addressing was a wider one than that of the academy.<br>
<br>The Thompsons' Halifax household was busy: Dorothy remembered it as a &#145;shambles&#146;. With three children she restricted herself to part-time work. At the beginning of <span class="italic">The Making of the English Working Class</span> Edward emphasized his debt to her: &#145;her collaboration is to be found, not in this or that particular, but in the way the whole problem is seen&#146;  (preface, 14&#150;15). They never collaborated in co-writing historical works in the manner of the Hammonds or the Webbs. They wrote separately, but with the same initial interest in working-class history, and as they worked they tended to develop the same approach to writing history, achieving much the same balance between theory and evidence. Although neither had served a formal postgraduate apprenticeship, they later imparted to their research students a sense of the rigour required in the production of written history. Clearly Edward's work took precedence in the Halifax years. Later feminist assertions that this amounted to exploitation gained some credence from the very rapid rise to pre-eminence as a historian of Chartism made by Dorothy once she became a full-time academic from 1968, but she has strongly rejected these allegations  (Thompson, <span class="italic">Outsiders</span>, 9&#150;10).<br>
<br>While teaching at Leeds University, Thompson wrote two books of formidable length. The first, a study of William Morris, <span class="italic">William Morris: Romantic to Revolutionary</span>, was published in 1955. The date is significant, for in the following year he broke with the Communist Party, later remarking that it was only in his thirty-third year that he had &#145;commenced to reason&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Poverty of Theory</span>, 1978, i). The study of Morris displayed some signs that its author was still operating within the orthodoxies of official communism. Reviewers certainly read it in that way. Thompson's reclaiming of Morris from woolly-thinking artist to committed and original socialist seemed in places to be implying that the nineteenth-century artist and writer would have approved of Stalin's Soviet Union: &#145;Visitors return from the Soviet Union with stories of the poet's dream [factory] already fulfilled&#146;  (1955 edn, 844). When he revised the work in 1977 Thompson confessed that he had allowed &#145;a few Stalinist pieties &hellip; to intrude upon the text&#146; and that he had then held to &#145;a somewhat reverent notion of Marxism as a received orthodoxy, and my pages included some passages of polemic&#146;. A different reading is now suggested. Thompson, viewing the book from his post-1956 perspective, suggested that discerning readers might have been able to detect in his stress on Morris's genius as a moralist, &#145;a submerged argument within the orthodoxy to which I then belonged&#146;. The truth is that Morris, as Thompson became immersed in his life and works, began to speak to him in the silent spaces of received Marxism. His biography, he suggested, was one of &#145;muffled revisionism&#146; and when his disagreement with orthodoxy became explicit in 1956, he recalled that he had been much sustained by what he had learnt &#145;in those years of close company with Morris&#146;  (1977 edn, 769&#150;70, 810).<br>
<br>In 1956 Edward and Dorothy Thompson were among 7000 members, including many prominent activists, who left the British Communist Party. The tremors had begun following Khrushchov's secret speech to the twentieth Soviet congress in February. Its revelations of Stalinism's atrocities soon became known outside the Soviet Union. A crisis of belief and of adherence began, which became an outflow by October when Soviet tanks entered Budapest to suppress the Hungarian rising. Explanations of why Thompson and others had remained in the British Communist Party over years when doubts had already been developing are complex. His generation had fought the war against fascism to a victory in which the Red Army had been decisive. They saw no other organization than the party which could provide the support and comradeship for those in whom anti-fascism was combined with a socialist vision. That vision had seemed part of a re-awakening at which many thought they had been present as the war in Europe came towards its end. In the resistance to fascism Thompson's own brother had become a communist martyr. The spirit of that moment was however an interlude of hope which had been crushed with the deadening imposition of the cold war.<br>
<br>Against such a background it is not surprising that Thompson through most of 1956 believed that something positive might still emerge which would allow British communism to develop the moral strength to survive as a legitimate political force, allowing more democratic processes and broader and freer discussion. To this end Thompson and fellow historian John Saville began to produce the critical, but internally directed, journal <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>. The party was unwilling to allow even this form of dissidence and ordered publication to cease. Refusal brought the suspension of Thompson and Saville and, with the invasion of Hungary, they resigned.<br>
<br>The events of 1956 were decisive for Thompson and for many others on the left. But what he wrote against Stalinism in the third issue of <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span> in November hardly reads simply as an immediate response to a present crisis:<blockquote>the subordination of the moral and imaginative faculties to political and administrative authority is wrong: the elimination of moral criteria from political judgement is wrong: the fear of independent thought, the deliberate encouragement of anti-intellectual trends among the people is wrong; the mechanical personification of unconscious class forces, the belittling of the conscious process of intellectual and spiritual conflict, all this is wrong. (&#145;Through the smoke of Budapest&#146;, <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>, 3, 1956, 3)</blockquote>Here, although still in a journal addressing its argument to the morally moribund British Communist Party, is already indicated a challenge to old communist thinking from the mobilizing vision: of the &#145;socialist humanism&#146;, of which Thompson was to be, through his writings, the most prominent proselytizer.<h2>
<a name="Thefirstnewleft"></a>The first new left</h2>Socialist humanism would, Thompson hoped, provide the liberating approach around which a new left movement could emerge. In simple terms it would restore to the Marxist tradition (after 1956 Thompson tended to describe himself as a historian working in the Marxist tradition), the dimension which had been partly lost by Marx himself as he moved on from the writings of his youth to the economic certainties of <span class="italic">Capital</span>. It had certainly been lost from the Soviet version of communism. Later Thompson recalled his sense of a &#145;real silence&#146; in Marx, lying in the &#145;area that anthropologists would call value systems&#146;. The &#145;degeneration of the theoretical vocabulary of mainstream Marxism&#146; had led to a desensitization of human qualities such as imagination and passion. Marx may have replaced the classical economists' economic man with &#145;revolutionary economic man&#146;, but the injury lay in defining man as essentially economic in the first place  (D. Thompson, viii&#150;ix).<br>
<br>From 1956 to the ending of its first phase in 1962, the Thompsons strove to further the dream of a new left. Its formative journal <span class="italic">The New Reasoner</span> was edited and distributed from their Halifax home and in its pages were contained the defining texts of the &#145;socialist humanist&#146; vision. The first new left, however, amounted to more than a journal: it was a campaign to mobilize manifold voices of protest into a movement. Notably it was strong in its support for the nascent Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament from 1957, something which of itself was a breakaway from the official communist line of the nuclear-armed Soviet Union. Running a national journal was inevitably burdensome, and in 1959 <span class="italic">The New Reasoner</span> merged with the <span class="italic">Universities and Left Review</span> to become the <span class="italic">New Left Review</span>.<br>
<br>The two journals came from different backgrounds. That of the <span class="italic">New Reasoner</span> was unashamedly provincial, committed to a belief in the revolutionary potential of a medley of protest mobilizations and retaining some hopes of the British labour movement with a belief in the value of the traditions of protest embedded in a long history from peasants in revolt, through Levellers and Luddites to the Chartists and beyond. Based in London and dominated by young Oxbridge socialists, the partner journal, however, was more self-consciously theoretical. It was this approach which came to characterize the <span class="italic">New Left Review</span>, when, following an editorial coup in 1962, Thompson and his associates were ousted from their various positions on the journal by a group of younger men led by Perry Anderson. This was more than a generational change. It was a fundamental shift in perspective and in the form of socialist vision. As Thompson saw things, it was a displacement of the first new left with a second, which attached no immediacy to mobilizing the diverse protest forces on the left, but rather saw the British working class as hopelessly compromised and supine in its relationship with capitalism. The function of left intellectuals, in its view, was to provide and refine the energizing socialist theory which history had thus far denied it. In short, the first and the second new lefts read British, and especially English, history in fundamentally different ways. That divergence prompted in the mid-1960s a rigorous and at times savage debate, with the lone voice of Thompson embattled against Anderson and his co-editor, Tom Nairn. Ironically in 1963, at the very moment when Thompson was at his most detached from formal association with a socialist organization, his greatest work was published, which brought his writing to a much wider audience.<h2>
<a name="Themakingofahistorianfrom1963"></a>The making of a historian from 1963</h2>During the early 1960s Thompson had been engaged on what was quickly recognized as a book of monumental importance. The appearance of <span class="italic">The Making of the English Working Class</span> was a transforming event in twentieth-century historiography. More than 800 pages long and priced accordingly, it did not at first suggest an impact on historical scholarship which has been described as &#145;truly alchemic&#146;  (Eastwood, 637). By 1968 when it appeared in its first British paperback edition, it had already become an established classic. In a work which has come to be seen as the single most influential work of English history of the post-war period, Thompson set out to demonstrate how between 1790 and 1832, under the joint pressures of political oppression and economic exploitation, English working men came to see themselves as a class: a class both made by the changing circumstances in which they laboured and lived, and self-making in terms of the responses they made to this experience. By the time of the crisis over parliamentary reform in 1830&#150;32, a form of working-class consciousness had emerged, drawing on past traditions of resistance and rights as well as on present experiences. Further, Thompson argued, against generations of traditional conservative writing, that consciousness included the possibility of political revolution, which came very close at more than one moment.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the twenty-first century the book remains in print with its main text hardly changed. Its narrative and conclusion are hardly now accepted in all their detail by historians of the period, but the influence of <span class="italic">The Making</span> has not depended on that. In its preface, which has become a key historiographical text in its own right, Thompson made the defining statement of &#145;history from below&#146;. He wrote of seeking to rescue groups of dissenting working people, like the Luddites, from &#145;the enormous condescension of posterity&#146;, putting them back into the history which they had made with their own life experiences. Also in that preface is his now classic definition of class and how it eventuates in history. Class, he argued, could not be understood in purely structural terms, be they those of twentieth-century sociology or those of later Marxist orthodoxy: &#145;class happens when some men, as a result of common experiences &hellip; feel and articulate the identity of their interests as between themselves, and as against other men, whose interests are different from (and usually opposed to) theirs&#146;. The class experience may have been largely determined by the productive relations into which men were born or entered, but class consciousness, the way in which these experiences were handled in cultural terms, in traditions, value systems, and institutions, was not so determined: &#145;Consciousness of class arises in the same way in different times and places, but never in <i>just</i> the same way&#146;. The book is the most significant exposition of socialist humanism in actual historical writing with its insistence that class was defined by men &#145;as they live their own history&#146;  (preface, 9&#150;13). Written with passion and commitment, <span class="italic">The Making</span> freed the historical imagination, redefined the subject matter of social and labour history, and pushed open more than one door of historical closure.<br>
<br>Thompson's rocketing reputation took him in 1965 to the directorship of the Centre for the Study of Social History at the newly opened University of Warwick and the family moved to Leamington Spa. Then at the beginning of his forties, he was an imposing figure. Tall and sparely built, his craggily handsome features were topped by an unusually thick head of hair, which flopped uncontrollably over his forehead. He had no particular affectation in dress, unless smoking small cigarettes alternately with hardly larger cheroots counts as such. The intensity of his gaze could be at first disconcerting, but it was his habit to listen properly to those who were speaking, for except in moments of anger he was not an interrupter.<br>
<br>Thompson's Warwick experience was mixed. With his postgraduate students his relationship was excellent. They remember with affection a painstaking and inspiring mentor, and most became lifelong friends. With the university itself relations were more strained. Resources for the centre were short of his expectation; undergraduate teaching took up much time, as did boards and meetings, leading him to complain that little time was left for writing. His writing was itself undergoing a shift. <span class="italic">The Making</span> carried marks of having been written by someone not fully bound by academic conventions. Its invective, for example in its infamously hostile depiction of Methodism as &#145;ritual psychic masturbation&#146;, could be immoderate. He had a blind spot when it came to quantification, and a glimpse of his feelings towards some academic tendencies is exemplified in a passage which summarizes the average worker's share in the benefits of the industrial revolution as: &#145;more potatoes, a few articles of cotton clothing for his family, soap and candles, some tea and sugar, and a great many articles in the <span class="italic">Economic History Review</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Making</span>, 1968 edn, 351).<br>
<br>From the mid-1960s Thompson's own historical essays began to appear in leading journals. Two appeared in <span class="italic">Past and Present</span>, whose editorial board he joined in 1969. &#145;Time, work-discipline and industrial capitalism&#146; (1967) and &#145;The moral economy of the English crowd in the eighteenth century&#146; (1971) became classics, and, especially the second, have been internationally influential on how the processes of resistance and adaptation to capitalism have become understood. These articles are part of a body of work centring on the eighteenth century, now most accessible through the collection <span class="italic">Customs in Common</span> (1991). At Warwick too he developed an interest in the history of crime and the criminal law. <span class="italic">Albion's Fatal Tree: Crime and Society in Eighteenth-Century England</span> (D. Hay and others, eds., 1975) was a pioneering joint production with several of his research students, while the single-authored <span class="italic">Whigs and Hunters</span> (1975), a study of the power exercised through the law, is remarkable for a conclusion which recognizes the dichotomous significance of the law as a force which not only empowers but restricts the actions of the empowered. Increasingly Thompson's work showed enriching but cautiously employed inputs from disciplines like anthropology and folklore as he tackled subjects like wife-selling and &#145;rough music&#146;. In the mid-1960s too he had continued the debate with Anderson and Nairn and <span class="italic">The New Left Review</span>. Most notably he produced in &#145;The peculiarities of the English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Socialist Register</span>, 1965, 311&#150;62) a challenging over-arching interpretation of the course of English history rescuing it, as he saw things, from the distortions of the continental Marxisms of the &#145;lumpen intelligentsia&#146;.<br>
<br>Thompson's final quarrel with the university's authorities was a public one. In 1970 students occupying the registry discovered files revealing a close and secret involvement of the university with prominent industrialists in its region, which included spying upon and informing on the activities of students and academics viewed as political dissidents, unfriendly to industrial capitalism. Thompson became the most conspicuous of those who publicized these revelations. With astonishing speed he edited a volume which situated Warwick as symptomatic of a threatened higher educational system in which values and freedoms were being lost in an increasing subordination to the requirements of industrial capitalism (<span class="italic">Warwick University Limited</span>, 1970).<br>
<br>Thompson left Warwick in 1971 to become a full-time writer. Dorothy had begun a period as a full-time university teacher at the University of Birmingham in 1968. For almost a decade from the new family home, Wick Episcopi, a splendid Georgian house on the outskirts of Worcester, he furthered his eighteenth-century project and wrote a number of political essays, often concerned with the defence of liberties against the state. In an earlier part of his life most of his essays and reviews had tended to appear in journals little read outside the left, but from the later 1960s they were appearing in periodicals such as <span class="italic">New Society</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, and in the quality newspapers. Many of these essays, alongside some earlier ones, were reprinted in <span class="italic">Writing by Candlelight</span> (1980) and <span class="italic">The Heavy Dancers</span> (1985). Much of Thompson's writing, especially within arguments on the left, is bitter and unforgiving, but several of the essays of this period reveal how capable he was of using humour to make his points. He could, as in the essay &#145;Writing by candlelight&#146;, produced at a time when strikes were resulting in power cuts, and parodying the uncomprehending attitude of the upper and middle classes to it, produce very effective satire.<br>
<br>An early critic of the &#145;betrayal&#146; of socialism by the Labour governments of Harold Wilson, Thompson was, with Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall, an editor of the <span class="italic">Mayday Manifesto</span> in 1967, which explicitly sought to present a socialist alternative  (R. Williams, ed., <span class="italic">Mayday Manifesto, 1968</span>, 1968, 9). Yet he retained a belief that the Labour Party, as the outcome of the history of British workers' struggles, still possessed a potential at least to contribute to a political transformation. As late as 1979 he was stating this view in a defence of the role of Marxists within the party (&#145;The acceptable faces of Marxism&#146;, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 5 Feb 1979). The world of contingencies inhabited by party politics was alien to the stances adopted by a man who could not accommodate moral relativism. Something of a sense of isolation, a tendency to see himself as a lone battler on the left, had surfaced in him at various times from at least the collapse of the first new left. It was in such a mood and driven by a sense of its real potential to do harm that in 1978, in <span class="italic">The Poverty of Theory</span>, he took on the then fashionable French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, whose denial of individual agency and dismissal of morality he perceived as a form of neo-Stalinism. In this book Thompson made his most deliberate defence of history as a discipline with a distinguishing epistemology and methodologies. It lost him some friends on the left, who considered his stance arrogant and self-centred, and his language extreme. His apparent refusal to debate the issue of theory in moderate and open terms at an Oxford history workshop session in 1979 has entered the collective memory of the British left, although it has been suggested that he had assumed a sense of irony which his audience seemingly lacked  (R&eacute;e, 19).<h2>
<a name="Peacecampaigningfrom1980"></a>Peace campaigning from 1980</h2>The Thompson angered by the closed thinking of French structuralism was a man becoming increasingly concerned with the threat of nuclear war. At the beginning of the 1980s he put aside his &#145;trade&#146; as a historian to devote himself to the campaign against nuclear weapons. He believed that in the Reagan&#150;Thatcher era the cold war was entering a phase in which nuclear conflict was becoming probable. In 1980 with Dan Smith he wrote <span class="italic">Protest and Survive</span>, a pamphlet which did more than any other to revive interest in the peace movement, while his &#145;Notes on exterminism, the last stage of civilization&#146; (<span class="italic">New Left Review</span>, 1980) provided a significant analysis of the stage the arms race had by then reached. It had become a self-sustaining system propelled by an internal dynamic and a reciprocal logic. Against this process the Thompsons and their associates pitted their resisting energies for the next several years. Most importantly, in that year he drafted the European Nuclear Disarmament appeal, the mobilizing document which added a new dimension to the peace movement in insisting on the responsibility of both sides for the intensifying arms race and calling for a European movement of protest and resistance. It established the non-alignment of the peace movement as it opened contacts between east and west, associating the campaign for peace with the movement for democracy in Eastern Europe. Thompson was its most prominent public figure, becoming familiar to television audiences and newspaper readers and continuing to write articles and pamphlets, which showed &#145;how to attack not just a wrong but the official discourse which says that wrong is inevitable&#146;  (N. Ascherson, &#145;E. P. Thompson: defender of the faithful few&#146;, <span class="italic">Independent on Sunday</span>, 5 Sept 1993).<br>
<br>The contribution made by the peace movement to the ending of the cold war is a matter of continuing debate. Thompson considered it significant. In 1990 he remarked that he had no regrets at having been turned aside from his writing, because he was &#145;convinced that the peace movement made a major contribution to dispersing the cold war, which had descended like a polluting cloud on every field of political and intellectual life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Customs in Common</span>, ix). A co-founder of European Nuclear Disarmament, Mary Kaldor, predicted that in time Thompson would be viewed, along with Mikhail Gorbachov and V&aacute;clav Havel, as &#145;one of the key individuals who influenced the course of events in the 1980s&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 30 Aug 1993). Many would agree, but there is no likelihood of a consensus: students of international relations are reluctant to acknowledge the efficacy of a moral crusade, while conservative historians continue to stress the firmness of the West's leaders in outfacing their cold-war enemy to the point of climb-down and ultimate collapse.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears19881993andassessment"></a>Last years, 1988&#150;1993, and assessment</h2>With the ending of the arms race Thompson returned to his &#145;trade&#146;. The long-delayed <span class="italic">Customs in Common</span> appeared in 1991 bringing together the essays which had given a new shape to the history of eighteenth-century England. His study of his father's relationship with Tagore came two years later, while progress was made on other projects: notably the completion of his major work on William Blake (<span class="italic">Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law</span>, 1993). Sadly that book, which meant so much to him, appeared shortly after his death. Thompson's last years were a five-year battle with a series of debilitating illnesses. He was very ill indeed, and what he accomplished in those years was remarkable, but finally on 28 August 1993 he died peacefully with Dorothy at his side in his garden at Wick Episcopi.<br>
<br>E. P. Thompson was one of the most prominent of twentieth-century British intellectuals working within the Marxist tradition. While he was best known for his historical writing and peace campaigning, these did not represent the whole of his intellectual activity. His significance in both roles owed most to his power as a writer, and as a writer his output was prolific and varied. He published poetry from an early age and in 1988 in his mid-sixties he published a satirical novel: <span class="italic">The Sykaos Papers</span>. His intellectual and writing skills were also displayed in the field of English literature, perhaps most noticeably in his study of William Blake. As a political essayist his was the most distinctive pen from the British left, writing with a passion, polemical verve, and remorseless reasoning which compares with the radical journalists and pamphleteers of the early nineteenth century, whom he much admired.<br>
<br>Had he not been otherwise preoccupied, Thompson would have found himself in the 1980s increasingly responding to critiques of his work. These began even before the collapse of communism influenced all who worked in the Marxist tradition and made &#145;class&#146; an unfashionable concept around which to organize a historical narrative. The rise of women's history brought comment on what was perceived as a silence about gender in <span class="italic">The Making</span>; an increasing concern with ethnicity noted that, too, as a silence. The rise of post-modernism and the so-called &#145;linguistic turn&#146; directed attack on to most existing forms of historical practice. It is a measure of Thompson's stature that his work attracted and continues to attract more critical attention than that of any other historian of his generation. The academic establishment was reluctant to accord him the recognition he merited, the British Academy electing him to a fellowship only in 1992. As the leading British historian Eric Hobsbawm has explained, he was a very special historian:<blockquote>He had the capacity to produce something qualitatively different from the rest of us, not to be measured on the same scale. Let us simply call it genius &hellip; None of his mature work could have been written by anyone else. (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 30 April 1993)</blockquote>
