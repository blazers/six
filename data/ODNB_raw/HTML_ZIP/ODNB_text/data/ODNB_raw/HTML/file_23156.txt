<span class="headword">Ratcliffe,  John</span>  (1707&#150;1776), <span class="occ">book collector</span>, was born at Bermondsey on 20 November 1707, the son of Thomas Ratcliffe, a victualler of the parish of St Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey, and his wife, Ann. He was baptized on 7 December at St Mary Magdalen. Little is known of his life, but an account derived mainly from T. F. Dibdin and printed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1812, and later augmented by John Nichols in his <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>, claims that Ratcliffe's love of books was kindled by studying the leaves and scraps of books which, as a chandler, he purchased as waste paper, or which were brought into his Bermondsey shop for his use in wrapping cheese. These sources, too, paint a curious picture of him later in life: corpulent, with very thick legs, walking very slowly from his house in East Lane, Rotherhithe, to the Presbyterian chapel in Jamaica Road when Dr Roger Flexman was the minister there, wearing:<blockquote>a fine coat, either red or brown, with gold lace buttons, and a fine silk embroidered waistcoat, of scarlet with gold lace, and a large and well-powdered wig. With his hat in one hand and a gold-headed cane in the other, he marched royally along, and not unfrequently followed by a parcel of children, wondering who the stately man could be.</blockquote>Ratcliffe evidently prospered in his trade; he married (though the identity of his wife is not known) and had two children, who both died young. He found himself able to indulge his passion for books, spending days at a time in the warehouses of booksellers, sending out for food at intervals. In his last thirty years he amassed in his house a formidable collection, which included some very rare items. On Thursday mornings he would show his latest acquisitions to other book and print collectors of the day, such as James West, Anthony Askew, and Topham Beauclerk.<br>
<br>Ratcliffe died early in 1776 and was buried on 3 February in the great vault of the church of St Andrew by the Wardrobe, in the City of London, which also contained the bodies of his two children. His will, made in 1770, contained elaborate and detailed arrangements for his interment, and probate was granted in the prerogative court of Canterbury five days before his funeral. The will makes clear that he held leasehold property in Shoe Lane, off Fleet Street. His widow was well provided for, as were other relatives and friends&#151;but, curiously, his library was not mentioned. The entire collection was sold by Christies on nine successive evenings, beginning on 27 May 1776. Entitled by the catalogue <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Ratcliffiana</span> and described as &#145;the elegant and truly valuable library of John Ratcliffe, Esq &hellip; collected with great judgment and expence during the last thirty years of his life&#146;, the library was sold in 1675 lots, many of them comprising up to 100 items. It was particularly strong in the productions of early English printers and in books of the sixteenth century. At least 100 incunables are individually mentioned, including forty-eight Caxtons, twenty of which were acquired by George III. There were also many manuscripts including (lot no. 1674) Ratcliffe's own four-volume catalogue &#145;of the rare old black letter, and other curious and uncommon books&#146;. Copies of the sale catalogue, with prices, exist in both the British Library and the Bodleian. They show that one of the highest-priced lots (no. 1373), at &pound;9, was the dedication manuscript copy, made for Humfrey, duke of Gloucester, of the English verse translation of Palladius, <span class="italic">Opus agriculturae</span>, with, fixed to its upper cover, a painted enamel miniature purporting to be a portrait of Duke Humfrey's wife, Jacqueline of Hainault (Bodl. Oxf., MS Duke Humfrey d. 2). Ratcliffe's books, though now scattered, can often be identified by collation and other notes in his hand on the flyleaves.<br>
