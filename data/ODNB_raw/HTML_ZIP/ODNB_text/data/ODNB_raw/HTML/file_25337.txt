<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Richard Herne</span>  (1840&#150;1895), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, born at 20 Marlborough Square, Chelsea, on 5 April 1840, was a younger son of Samuel Shepherd FSA (1798/9&#150;1856), and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyer. His grandfather Richard Herne Shepherd (1775&#150;1850) was from 1818 to 1848 a well-known revivalist preacher at the Ranelagh Chapel, Chelsea, and published, besides sermons and devotional works, a volume of verse entitled <span class="italic">Gatherings of Fifty Years</span> (1843).<br>
<br>The younger Richard was educated largely at home, developed a taste for literature, and in 1858 published verses entitled <span class="italic">Annus moriens</span>. In 1861 he issued an essay on <span class="italic">The School of Pantagruel</span>, in which he traced &#145;Pantagruelism&#146; in England from the earl of Rochester to Laurence Sterne. Subsequently he edited booksellers' editions of the classics, including Blake's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1868 and 1874), Shelley's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1871), Charles Lamb's <span class="italic">Poetry for Children</span> (1872 and 1878), Chapman's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1873), Lamb's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1875), Ebenezer Jones's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1879), Poe's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1884), Dickens's <span class="italic">Speeches</span> (1870), Dickens's <span class="italic">Plays and Poems</span> (1885), and Shelley's <span class="italic">Prose Works</span> (1888). In 1869 he published <span class="italic">Translations from C. Baudelaire with a Few Original Poems</span> (reissued 1879); in 1873 he printed, with notes, Coleridge's forgotten <span class="italic">Osorio: a Tragedy</span>, and in 1875 &#145;The Lover's Tale&#146; (of 1833) and other early uncollected poems of Tennyson, unearthed from albums and periodicals. Fifty copies were privately printed in 1875, but the volume was suppressed by injunction in the court of chancery. In 1878 he published Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <span class="italic">Earlier Poems</span> without the assent of the writer's living representatives, who warmly resented his action. Continuing his career as a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles, he prepared editions in the same year of the juvenilia of H. W. Longfellow and Moore; and <span class="italic">Sultan Stork</span>, a volume of early pieces by W. M. Thackeray, in 1887. In 1878 there also appeared an agreeable confection of biographical and bibliographical gossip in his <span class="italic">Waltoniana</span>. The following year Shepherd obtained &pound;150 damages from the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> newspaper for an &#145;injurious review&#146; of his revised edition of Lamb's <span class="italic">Poetry for Children</span>. In 1881 he published a dull <span class="italic">Memoir of the Life and Writings of Thomas Carlyle</span>, some passages of which had to be cancelled.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Shepherd studied modern bibliography, preparing bibliographical accounts of Ruskin (1879), Dickens (1880; rev. edn, 1885), Thackeray (1881; rev. 1887 and appended to <span class="italic">Sultan Stork</span>), Carlyle (1881), Swinburne (1883, 1884, and 1887), and Tennyson; the last-named was published posthumously in 1896, as an expansion of Shepherd's earlier <span class="italic">Tennysoniana</span> (1866, and 1879). Some of these works were published by Shepherd's brother, who, under the name of Frank Hollings, ran a bookshop in Holborn.<br>
<br>Shepherd was a heavy drinker and lived for many years at the Bald-faced Stag, an inn in Putney. A vivid impression of him is given by W. Partington, who described him as:<blockquote>a tall angular man, often shabbily dressed, with shoulders rounded from long nights of poring over books. He was remarkable for the possession of a most beautiful voice and gentle manners. One of his idiosyncrasies was his persistence in walking always in the middle of the street&#151;in defiance of the shouting and gesticulating jehus of London's cabs &hellip; (Partington, 200)</blockquote>Shepherd died in Camberwell House Lunatic Asylum, London, on 15 July 1895. At the time of his death he was preparing a bibliography of Coleridge for <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, to which he was a frequent contributor.<br>
<br>Shepherd's editorial work was extensive but more notable for dogged perseverance than discrimination. However, he never descended to forgery as was falsely alleged, long after his death, by T. J. Wise.<br>
