<span class="headword">Barking,  Clemence  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1163&#150;<em>c.</em>1200), <span class="occ">Benedictine nun and hagiographer, of Barking Abbey</span>, was responsible for an Anglo-Norman life of St Catherine of Alexandria which is the only life of this saint known to have been written by a woman in medieval Britain. Of Clemence's own life as much or as little is known as of that of her famous contemporary Marie de France (<i>fl</i>. 1154&#150;1189): both women name themselves in their texts, and this, together with the texts themselves, is the basis for knowledge of them. The earliest extant manuscript of Clemence's <span class="italic">La vie de Sainte Catherine</span> dates from <i>c</i>.1200. A learned woman at Barking Abbey in this period is likely to have been from noble or at least gentry stock, and although unprofessed women sometimes spent time in such convents, Clemence, on her own testimony, was a nun. She chose a virgin martyr and patron saint of female learning as the subject of the life for which she claimed authorship, and the <span class="italic">Vie de Sainte Catherine</span> emphasizes the superiority of the saint's life as bride of Christ to that of the married life of the emperor Maxentius's wife (whom Catherine converts).<br>
<br>Learning among the women of Barking is witnessed in the seventh century and from the tenth century to the dissolution, making the abbey perhaps the longest-lived, albeit not continuously recorded, institutional centre of literary culture for women in British history. Clemence's Latin, like that of some other women at Barking in the twelfth century, seems to have been good: her life of Catherine is a skilful translation from the most ornate and learned of the Latin lives of St Catherine (the longer, so-called &#145;vulgate&#146; version). The translation was probably made for a double audience: Clemence names herself as the translator and says that her poem was undertaken &#145;for love of Barking&#146;  (Clemence of Barking, verses 2690&#150;2), but within the poem she also addresses the audience as <i>segnurs</i>  (ibid., verse 1159). This suggests that in addition to the nuns of Barking and, perhaps, other conventual audiences, Clemence had a court audience in mind. As one of the old Benedictine royal nunneries, Barking was a cultivated and aristocratic milieu which remained closely connected with the Anglo-Norman court. An Anglo-Norman verse life of Edward the Confessor, underlining both his virgin sanctity and the legitimacy of the Anglo-Norman succession, was produced by an anonymous nun of Barking between 1163 and 1189. Clemence has been thought, though not proven, to have been its composer.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">La vie de Sainte Catherine</span> is written in accomplished Anglo-Norman octosyllabics, and draws on liturgical, devotional, and romance registers in elaborating its source material. The poem alludes extensively to the Anglo-Norman <span class="italic">Tristan</span> as part of its comparison of courtly and marital love with the love experienced by the celibate woman as a bride of Christ. It may also owe something to Anselm's thought on God's nature and power.<br>
<br>An elegant and powerful hagiography, the poem is of particular value as a twelfth-century woman writer's account of the emotional and intellectual value of a life vowed to virginity. In addition to extended treatment of Catherine's debate with fifty pagan philosophers, the life contains much narratorial commentary and reflection. Like all medieval women and medieval laymen, enclosed nuns were forbidden preaching (and many other forms of public speaking such as university <i>disputatio</i>), but Clemence used the hagiographic legend as a vehicle for addressing the concerns of her own community and of the society in which she lived.<br>
<br>The manuscript evidence suggests that her voice, in so far as it is represented by her <span class="italic">Vie de Sainte Catherine</span>, did not go unheard. While some Anglo-Norman hagiography survives only in a single holograph, Clemence's text is extant in three manuscripts (two insular, one continental), and it is also quoted in a large insular preaching compilation of the late thirteenth or fourteenth century. The life also has echoes and analogies in other Anglo-Norman hagiographic works, though the significance of these textual connections is not yet fully established. The possibilities of mutual influence between Clemence and the other named women writers of post-conquest Britain&#151;Marie de France; Marie, who may have been a nun of Chatteris, author of the Anglo-Norman life of St &AElig;thelthryth; the Marie who wrote the <span class="italic">Espurgatoire Seint Patrice</span>; and the writer of the Barking <span class="italic">Edouard</span>, if this was not Clemence herself&#151;also have yet to be fully investigated.<br>
