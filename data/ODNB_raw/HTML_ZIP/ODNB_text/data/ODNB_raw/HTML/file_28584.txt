<span class="headword">Wallop,  Robert</span>  (1601&#150;1667), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 20 July 1601, the only son of Sir Henry Wallop (1568&#150;1642) of Farleigh Wallop in Hampshire, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter and heir of Robert Corbet of Morton Corbet in Shropshire. Sir Henry, one of the wealthiest members of the Hampshire gentry, and many times an MP, was heir to the substantial Irish estates acquired by his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28580/', "Sir Henry Wallop")</script>, vice-treasurer and lord justice in Ireland. The family's status ensured that Robert, who matriculated from Hart Hall, Oxford, on 5 May 1615, was certain to assume an important role in his native county, and he did so even during his father's lifetime. He was returned to parliament for Andover in 1621, 1624, and 1628, and as a knight of the shire for Hampshire in 1625 and 1626, and, having been given permission to chose his bride, was able to secure a prestigious match in the shape of Anne (<i>d</i>. 1662), daughter of Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton.<br>
<br>By 1640 Wallop was probably identified with the opposition to Charles I, having offered resistance to certain government policies. He delayed paying the forced loan, refused to compound for his knighthood, and declined to contribute to the first bishops' war (1639). Returned to both the Short and Long parliaments for Andover, he made no immediate impression but became an important figure on committees relating to Ireland once the rebellion there threatened his estates in Wexford. Thereafter, Irish affairs became one of his abiding concerns, although his support for parliament rested on more than self-interest. After 1642 he also became a linchpin of the parliamentarian war effort and administration in Hampshire, and by February 1644 was sufficiently influential to secure nomination to the committee of both kingdoms, and became deeply involved in negotiations with the Scots, and in preparing for negotiations with the king at Uxbridge in early 1645. He supported those who sought a harsh settlement, and who masterminded the self-denying ordinance, and he was a stalwart of those committees on Irish affairs instigated by the Independents rather than the presbyterians. It was as an Independent that he was involved in the increasingly tense negotiations with the Scots in late 1646, culminating in the treaty whereby the king was handed over to parliament (January 1647).<br>
<br>Wallop became less prominent at Westminster after the presbyterian &#145;counter-revolution&#146; in the summer of 1647, perhaps because of the growing need to oversee the security of Hampshire, although he was a member of the Derby House committee during 1648. He was willing to sit in the Rump after Pride's Purge, and was made a commissioner for the high court of justice to try the king. Although he attended two meetings of the commissioners and two days of the trial, he was absent at the sentencing on 27 January, and did not sign the death warrant. He remained willing to serve the republic, however, and was probably perceived to be a zealous advocate of the new regime. He was named to the first council of state (14 January 1649), and took the engagement (19 February). He claimed to have lost &pound;50,000 through the war and his services to the parliamentarian cause were rewarded with the grant of &pound;10,000 out of the estate of the marquess of Winchester. Although increasingly inactive, Wallop secured nomination to the second council of state (12 February 1650), and to its most important subcommittees. He was not elected again in February 1651, but was emphatically restored to the council in the poll held on 25 November, on the back of a tide of republican fervour after the army's success at Worcester. His attendance in council was becoming erratic, however, and his interests were apparently limited to the affairs of Ireland and Scotland. He was re-elected to the council of state in November 1652 but by then he was probably growing disillusioned with the drift of political events, and the growing influence of the army.<br>
<br>Wallop was prepared to accommodate the protectorate, although he probably opposed its establishment. He was able to secure election for Hampshire to both the 1654 and 1656 parliaments despite rumours of his involvement in a plot against Cromwell. His active participation in national affairs only resumed, however, as a &#145;commonwealthsman&#146; during the elections for the protectoral parliament of Richard Cromwell, to which he was himself returned for Hampshire, and in which he sought to assert the power of the Commons over the protector and the &#145;other house&#146;. During the restored Rump in the summer of 1659 he was chosen for the council of state, although he withdrew from Westminster in the face of growing pressure from the army, until he was able to help secure the Rump's second restoration in December 1659. Thereafter he returned to the Commons and council of state, until retiring once again with the readmission of the secluded members in February 1660.<br>
<br>Although he assisted the escape of some regicides, Wallop saw no reason to flee as the Restoration approached, and even secured election to the Convention Parliament, for Whitchurch, although he was quickly made incapable of sitting. He did not face trial in 1660, since he was neither a signatory of the king's death warrant, nor accounted a regicide for having been present when the sentence was read. Nevertheless, at some point before July 1661 he was imprisoned for his part in the proceedings, having failed to secure a pardon. He protested that he &#145;ever did and doth from his soul abhor and detest that most horrid and execrable murder&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 151), and that he had attended the trial at the behest of prominent royalists, in order to help the king. His ill fortune may have been linked to his great wealth, and a concerted attempt was clearly made to take control of his estate. His property was eventually protected by his brother-in-law, the earl of Southampton, on behalf of the family, while he himself languished in prison, to be subjected to ritual punishment each January. Despite his illness and imprisonment, he was able to marry twice following the death of his first wife in 1662. On 16 February 1663 he married Mary, daughter of the parliamentarian general John Lambert, and on 16 May 1666 he married one Elizabeth Thompson, who was granted permission to remain with him in the Tower until his death on 16 November 1667; his body was released for burial at Farleigh Wallop, on 7 January 1668. Wallop's widow, who married one Robert Needham in May 1669, was eventually awarded portions of the Irish estate, while his son Henry Wallop sat for Whitchurch in the Cavalier Parliament. Wallop's great-grandson, John Wallop, was created earl of Portsmouth in 1743.<br>
