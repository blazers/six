<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas</span>  (1661?&#150;1734?), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, is believed to have been born in 1661; but so far no clues to his birthplace or parentage have emerged. He was trained to draw by the elder William Faithorne, foremost portrait engraver of his day, whose sensitive touch was to influence Hill's own manner. Hill studied painting under the Dutch history painter Dirk Freres, whom Sir Peter Lely had encouraged to come to England. That Hill also received a liberal general education is evinced by his letters to Humfrey Wanley and the memoranda occasionally sent to George Vertue for his <span class="italic">Note Books</span>.<br>
<br>Hill emerged as an independent portrait painter about 1694. He had lodgings in London (in 1720, in York Buildings, off the Strand), but relished country visits to paint congenial sitters. Hill's portrait manner is graceful and unpompous. He liked to depict children out of doors, with swags of flowers or beside garden ornaments with curious antique reliefs, often with tall cypresses in the background. Waterhouse singled out <span class="italic">Susannah Strangways</span> (a young girl with a dove, <i>c</i>.1705; priv. coll.) as having a &#145;gentleness and refinement hardly to be found in any other portrait painter of the time&#146;  (Waterhouse, <span class="italic">Painting in Britain</span>, 95).<br>
<br>A beguiling portrait of the young actress Letitia Cross (known as &#145;The girl&#146;) was engraved by John Smith <i>c</i>.1700. Most of Hill's adult commissions were engraved; they include <span class="italic">Sir Henry Goodricke</span>, master of the ordnance (in cuirass), and <span class="italic">Lady Goodricke</span>, and several portraits of bishops, including <span class="italic">Philip Bisse, Bishop of Hereford</span> (New College, Oxford; engraved by Vertue, 1719); <span class="italic">George Hooper, Bishop of Bath and Wells</span> (1723; Wells Cathedral; engraved by G. White); and <span class="italic">William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury</span> (NPG).<br>
<br>Hill's most congenial commissions came from the Strangways family (later Fox-Strangways, and from 1741 earls of Ilchester), of Melbury House, Dorset. Hill's most inventive work there was a large family group (on canvas) for the grand staircase wall. Perhaps begun towards the end of the 1690s, after the old Tudor house had been enlarged and its garden redesigned, it depicts ten members of the intermarried Hornor and Strangways families in the garden at Melbury, Erato with her lyre presiding in stone, and a complete view of the house in the background. On the right, new lovers plight their troth (his hand delicately clasping hers) and, unusually for the times, Hill introduced an additional figure of a manservant, discreetly separated by drapery, bringing them a letter of congratulation.<br>
<br>From Melbury, on a later visit, Hill reported to Wanley:<blockquote>I was received perfectly friendly, like a Relation, as one of the family &hellip; How shall I doe to leave a fine seat, a Coach and six to take the air in, a great deal of good Company, a table with ten or fourteen dishes of meat &hellip; to come home to my poor station in Yorke buildings, considering a cloudy, heavy, stifled air must be my Lott? Why I shall now and then meet my friend Mr. Wanley and others such, and desire no more. (letter of 10 Sept 1720, Goulding and Adams, 449)</blockquote>Hill was a long-standing friend of the eminent scholar Humfrey Wanley. In 1708 Wanley became librarian to Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, and began to build up one of the finest collections of manuscripts ever assembled. Wanley was chiefly based at Wimpole Hall, where Hill was a welcome visitor, executing numerous commissions for the earl of Oxford; as well as copies of family portraits, these included portraits of members of Lord Oxford's circle of antiquarians, including <span class="italic">James Anderson</span> (&#145;Mr Anderson the famous Scots antiquarian&#146;), <span class="italic">Solomon Negri</span>, Hebrew scholar (a head, painted in 1717), and <span class="italic">John Daniel Schumacher</span>, 1722, curator of the tsar's books and antiquities, then on a visit to Wimpole. Lord Oxford also commissioned a half-length self-portrait of Hill. All these were dispersed in the late Lord Oxford's sale in 1742 (and are now untraced).<br>
<br>Hill painted three different portraits of Humfrey Wanley. The original of the first portrait (dated 1711, with the sitter displaying a large Greek text) is in the collection of the Society of Antiquaries of London (with a version in the Bodleian Library, Oxford). A second portrait, dated 1717, was presented to Oxford University by the second earl of Oxford in 1740 (Bodl. Oxf.); a replica is in the National Portrait Gallery. Hill's last, unique three-quarter-length portrait of his friend, painted in 1722 (and now in the British Museum), is the finest and most fully characterized of all his works. Wanley himself recognized this, writing to Schumacher that the portrait &#145;will be his Master-piece&#146;  (letter of 26 May 1722, P. L. Heyworth, ed., <span class="italic">The Letters of Humfrey Wanley</span>, 1966, 444&#150;5). It depicts Wanley virtually full-face and nearly full-length, sitting at ease in a many-buttoned velvet coat, one arm held over a larger than life-size brass head of the emperor Hadrian, the latest antiquity to enter the collections which he had the honour to curate. In its reflection of a life well spent, Hill's portrait of Humfrey Wanley anticipated Hogarth's <span class="italic">Captain Coram</span> by twenty years.<br>
<br>Wanley died in 1726. Hill may by then have retired from painting; one of Vertue's notes in 1725 refers briefly to &#145;Mr Tho Hills (painter) sale of pictures drawings plaster moulds and prints&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.8). Seemingly not recorded elsewhere, this may have been a private studio sale open only to Hill's associates. Vertue stated that Hill died at Mitcham in 1734; but his death cannot be traced there in or about that date; nor is it known whether he was married. If documentation of his life remains elusive and his self-portrait is lost, his work stands, in Ellis Waterhouse's words, as &#145;original and refreshing in a stereotyped age&#146;  (Waterhouse, <span class="italic">Painting in Britain</span>, 95).<br>
