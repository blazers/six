<span class="headword">O'Neill, Sir  Neil <span class="st"> [Niall]</span></span>, second baronet  (1657/8&#150;1690), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born late in December 1657 or early in 1658, and was the eldest son of Sir Henry O'Neill (<i>b</i>. 1625) of Shane's Castle, co. Antrim, who was created baronet, of Killelagh, on 23 February 1666, and his wife, Eleanor Talbot, sister of Richard Talbot, earl of Tyrconnell. O'Neill married in January 1677 Frances Molyneux (<i>d</i>. 1732), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18919/', "Caryll Molyneux, third Viscount Molyneux of Maryborough")</script>, with whom he had four or five daughters.<br>
<br>When Tyrconnell became lord deputy of Ireland in 1687, O'Neill received from his uncle first a captain's commission taken from Lord Kingston, and then the colonelcy of a regiment of dragoons. He was in France at the time of the revolution in England. In March 1689 he sailed with the French fleet that brought King James to Ireland. He was present at the siege of Londonderry, where on 13 July he was one of the six commissioners chosen to treat with the garrison. The siege was raised before any agreement was reached. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Armagh, a county then under Williamite occupation, and his regiment served under Patrick Sarsfield in the expedition to Sligo in October 1689. At the end of that year O'Neill tried unsuccessfully to muster recruits to go to France in a proposed Irish brigade.<br>
<br>At the battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690) O'Neill was placed with his dragoons on the extreme left of King James's army to guard the ford at Rosnaree. With his 500 men he &#145;did wonders&#146;  (Gilbert, 100) in preventing the 10,000 commanded by Meinhard, Count Schomberg from crossing for an hour. O'Neill was forced to withdraw by the arrival of the enemy's artillery and during the fighting he was shot in the thigh. The wound proved fatal. He died in Waterford eight days later and was buried in the Franciscan convent there.<br>
<br>He was succeeded to the baronetcy by his brother Sir Daniel O'Neill, who had been one of the members for Belfast in the Irish parliament of 1689. The title and estates became forfeit by a posthumous act of attainder in 1691. On petitioning the government, Sir Neil's widow was granted a forty-one-year lease on the Killelagh estate in 1700, which she sold the following year. Lady O'Neill died in 1732.<br>
