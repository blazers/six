<span class="headword">Westmacott,  Richard</span>  (1799&#150;1872), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Grosvenor Square, London, the eldest of the eight children of the sculptor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29114/', "Sir Richard Westmacott (1775&#150;1856)")</script> and Dorothy Margaret Wilkinson (<i>d</i>. 1834), the daughter of a Dr Wilkinson of Jamaica. He attended Ealing School, near London, from the age of nine. He originally wanted to become a barrister but yielded to his father's wish that he should enter his studio and be trained as a sculptor, and in 1818 he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools. In 1820 his father sent him to Italy, where he remained six years, studying ancient sculpture and its history. In Rome he received a few commissions, including a tomb monument for Rosa Bathurst (1824, protestant cemetery, Rome) and a marble figure of Diana for William Morritt (date unknown, Rokeby Park, co. Durham).<br>
<br>On his return to London, Westmacott resided in his father's house, 14 South Audley Street, until 1830, when he moved to 21 Wilton Place. In 1827 he exhibited his first sculpture at the Royal Academy, <span class="italic">Girl with a Bird</span>. During his career he exhibited eighty-two marble figures, reliefs, and busts at the Royal Academy and four works at the British Institution; most of these sculptures are now lost. In the 1830s he executed several important classicizing figures and reliefs, notably <span class="italic">Venus Carrying off Ascantus</span> (exh. RA, 1831) and <span class="italic">Venus Instructing Cupid</span> (exh. RA, 1838) for Francis Egerton, the earl of Ellesmere. His <span class="italic">Cymbal Player</span> (exh. RA, 1838; Chatsworth, Derbyshire) was purchased by the sixth duke of Devonshire, who commissioned Westmacott to make a chimney-piece (<i>c</i>.1833) for the dining-room at Chatsworth. For Henry Petty, the marquess of Lansdowne, he carved two reliefs, <span class="italic">Mercury Presenting Pandora to Prometheus</span> (exh. RA, 1837; priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Paolo and Francesca</span> (exh. RA, 1838; plaster version ex Sothebys, London, 12 May 1995).<br>
<br>In 1838 Westmacott was elected an ARA and became a full member in 1849, when he presented the relief <span class="italic">Go and Sin No More</span> as his diploma piece (Royal Academy, London). From 1840 until he retired in 1855 he executed mainly portrait busts and funerary monuments. One of his most accomplished busts portrays John Henry Newman (exh. RA, 1841; Birmingham Oratory), the future cardinal and his childhood friend from Ealing School. His greatest tomb monuments are those raised to Charles Hussey Packe (<i>c</i>.1842, Prestwold, Leicestershire), Philip Yorke, third earl of Hardwicke (<i>c</i>.1845, Wimpole, Cambridgeshire), and Charlotte Egerton (1847, Rostherne, Cheshire). He also made a commemorative memorial to the Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin (1859, Royal Naval College chapel, Greenwich). His only important public work in London was the sculpture in the pediment of the west front of the Royal Exchange, erected 1842&#150;4. On 26 June 1845 he married Caroline Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Harry Edgell of Cadogan Place, London; the couple had several children.<br>
<br>In 1857 Westmacott succeeded his father as professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy, an office which he held until 1867. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, to which he was elected on 25 May 1837. Well known as a writer and lecturer on art, he contributed articles on sculpture to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>, the <span class="italic">English Encyclopaedia</span>, and the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span> and published <span class="italic">The Handbook of Ancient and Modern Sculpture</span> in 1864. In addition, in 1839, he designed eight engraved illustrations and wrote the text to a moral allegory <span class="italic">The Fighte of Freewille</span>. Richard Westmacott retired from the Royal Academy about a year before his death, which took place at his home at 1 Kensington Gate, Hyde Park, London, on 19 April 1872.<br>
