<span class="headword">Atkyns,  Richard</span>  (1615&#150;1677), <span class="occ">army officer and writer on printing</span>, was the only child of Richard Atkyns (1584&#150;1636/7) of Tuffley, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Mary, second daughter of Sir Edwin Sandys, of Latimer, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Sandys, of The Vyne, Hampshire. He was educated at home by two cruel and incompetent tutors before attending grammar school in Gloucester, but was withdrawn after contracting smallpox. In 1629 he entered Balliol College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, remaining there for two years without taking a degree. He proceeded to Lincoln's Inn, where his grandfather Richard Atkyns had been a noted judge and his uncle Edward was a governor. However, &#145;upon some disgust in my entrance&#146;, he was recalled to join his grandmother at The Vyne  (Atkyns, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 3&#150;4).<br>
<br>About 1635 Atkyns embarked upon a continental tour with the Catholic son of Thomas, second Baron Arundell of Wardour, with separate protestant and Catholic tutors. The young men visited Calais and Douai before travelling to Paris, where his companion contracted a fever and died. Atkyns returned to England and managed his father's estate on the outskirts of Gloucester, which he inherited soon after coming of age in 1636. He then travelled to London, where he joined the court, taking part in a royal masque and following the extravagant lifestyle of a minor courtier. Considering himself &#145;guilty of three imperfections, that would hinder my preferment there: a blushing modesty, a flexible disposition, and no great diligence&#146;, he returned to Gloucestershire, but found &#145;my house was burn'd down, and the place as a seat spoil'd by the long inhabiting of tenants&#146;  (Atkyns, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 9).<br>
<br>In March 1640 Atkyns married Martha, the young widow of Sir Patrick Acheson and daughter of John More. More had in 1618 been granted a lucrative patent for publishing texts and abridgements of the statutes and books of common law for forty years from March 1629. More immediately assigned his rights to the booksellers Miles Flesher, John Haviland, and Robert Young for an annual payment of &pound;60 and a third of the profits, which was left to his daughter in 1638. However, the partners sought to evade paying the annuity, purchasing instead the stock and premises of More's son Charles in 1639. Atkyns and his wife brought an action for recovery of this money, which was interrupted by the civil war. In the meantime Atkyns became involved with ill-advised financial transactions involving members of his mother's family which, together with his own and his wife's extravagance and the mismanagement of their estates, would ultimately contribute to his ruin.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war Atkyns accepted a commission under George Brydges, and raised a troop of sixty men, incurring substantial personal expense in the process. The troop later transferred into Prince Maurice's regiment. In May 1643 his regiment was detached to join the western army. He served with gallantry and distinction seeing action at the battles of Lansdown and Roundway Down, where he was adjutant-general of the horse. Following the royalist capture of Bristol in September 1645, he was offered several good commands but refused them and retired initially to his estate and then to Oxford. He left vivid descriptions of the fighting in his autobiographical <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, which was written in 1669 partly to answer accusations that he deserted the royalist cause after the war.<br>
<br>Atkyns's estates were sequestrated, and upon his return to London about 1645 he was imprisoned by both parliament and his creditors for the non-payment of debts undertaken before the war. He was initially fined &pound;500 for taking arms against parliament but this was reduced to &pound;140 on 3 February 1646, &#145;most of his estate being extended for debt, except &pound;130 a year in right of his wife&#146;  (Green). He also spent more than a year imprisoned in the Poultry and king's bench while his wife raised money to clear his debts. Thus on 22 September 1645 he sold the manor of Brickhampton to his uncle Sir Edward Atkyns for &pound;2500, and likewise on 1 September 1646 sold the manors of Morcote and Boyfield to him for a similar sum. (He also sold the manor of Hempstead for &pound;4400 to his cousin Robert Atkyns on 10 July 1655.) Richard and Martha retired to Tuffley, &#145;where we found the common fate of a sequestered estate; not only a ruin'd house, but gardens and orchards plough'd to the very doors&#146;  (Atkyns, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 50), and where they renewed their lease and repaired the property.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Atkyns was made a deputy lieutenant of Gloucestershire, and appointed justice of the peace. He also sought to restore his shattered fortunes by exploiting More's law patent. In November 1660 Charles II extended the privilege to Atkyns's cousin Edward, acting on his behalf, for a further forty years from its expiry in 1669. Atkyns and his wife also recommenced their action against Miles Flesher (the only survivor of More's original assignment), and in 1664 Flesher was compelled to pay all arrears up to 1643 and from the Restoration onwards. However, anticipating the recommencement of this suit, Flesher had sold the remaining rights to the Company of Stationers for &pound;200 in 1661, which sought to establish its own rights in respect of printing legal texts, above those of royal patentees.<br>
<br>Atkyns therefore entered into a complex series of actions against the company between 1661 and 1669, which are said to have cost him more than &pound;1000. He did so in alliance with the bookseller John Streater who, with Henry Twyford and James Flesher, had agreed to pay &pound;100 a year each to Atkyns to print the titles covered in the privilege. Atkyns and Streater were ultimately successful in their objectives: the company renounced all claim, and in mid-1675 it passed &#145;Coll. Atkins Byelaw&#146; acknowledging his patent in their regulations  (Johns, 318). Yet the costs incurred ruined both men, and Atkyns was again imprisoned for debt in the Marshalsea prison about 1667, several years before the matter was finally resolved. His relationship with his wife had also irretrievably broken down, as is apparent from the publication in 1669 of his curious <span class="italic">Vindication of Richard Atkyns &hellip; with certain sighs or ejaculations at the end of every chapter</span>, written while he was in prison and from which much of his biography is derived. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>As a part of his campaign to assert the royal prerogative to grant patents for printing, Atkyns published a broadside entitled <span class="italic">The Original and Growth of Printing</span>, about 1660. This claimed that printing had been introduced to England at Oxford in 1468, by Frederick Corsellis, formerly from Gutenberg's workshop, at the instigation of Archbishop Thomas Bourchier and at the expense of Henry VI. The evidence for this was the recent discovery of Rufinus's <span class="italic">Exposicio sancti Jeronimo</span> (1468; later shown to have been misdated for 1478), together with the alleged existence of documentation supporting this claim in the Lambeth Palace archives. Herman de la Fontaine Verwey suggests that the account may have been linked with a rich Flemish merchant called Nicholas Corcellis who was resident in London at that time and whom Atkyns may have known. The assertion was reiterated in 1664 in an enlarged quarto edition of the work, &#145;wherein is also demonstrated that printing appertaineth to the <i>Prerogative Royal</i>; and is a Flower of the <i>Crown of England</i>&#146;, dedicated to Charles II. A further quarto tract, <span class="italic">The Kings Grant of Privilege for Sole Printing Common-Law-Books, Defended</span> (1669), is also attributed to Atkyns. These were not serious attempts at charting the history of printing so much as diatribes against the Stationers' Company which had &#145;turn'd this famous <span class="smallcap">ART</span> [of printing] into a Mechanick Trade for a Livelyhood&#146;  (Atkyns, <span class="italic">Original</span>, 1664, 7). Yet Atkyns's account of the origins of English printing was widely accepted for seventy-five years and repeated in Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford</span> (1674) and Joseph Moxon's <span class="italic">Mechanick Exercises on the Whole Art of Printing</span> (1683). It only began to be questioned in Conyers Middleton's <span class="italic">Dissertation Concerning the Origin of Printing in England</span> (1735) but the &#145;imaginary Corsellis haunted our histories of printing, in the face of mounting disbelief, until he was dismissed as &#147;pure invention&#148; by A. C. Ducarel&#146; in 1765  (Carter, 12).<br>
<br>Atkyns describes himself in middle age as fat, sweaty, and suffering from gout, but denied his wife's accusations that he was &#145;a great Swearer, a Drunkard, &amp;c.&#146;  (Atkyns, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 71), or that he had been unfaithful. According to <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span> (1747&#150;66), he was &#145;an ingenious and observing man, who saw the vanity of this world sooner than others tho' of elder years&#146;  (vol. 1, pp. 255&#150;6), but the entry for William Caxton is less charitable about him, accusing Atkyns of telling an improbable tale:<blockquote>not heeding therein how slavishly for a little private and pecuniary advantage he undermined the liberties of his countrymen, how rancorously he vilified the Stationers, as a swarm of drones, who lived upon the labours of the painful Printers, and how unwarrantably he robbed Master Caxton of the honour wherewith he had long been by the suffrage of all learned men, undeniably invested. (vol. 2, p. 1226)</blockquote>Atkyns remained in prison until his death on 14 September 1677. He was buried two days later in the church of St George the Martyr, Southwark, London, at the expense of his cousins and executors, Sir Robert and Sir Edward Atkyns. His will, which Atkyns appears to have drawn up before his final imprisonment, was proved on 22 January 1678. Legal texts continued to be printed by &#145;the assigns of Edward and Richard Atkyns Esqs.&#146; until 1708.<br>
