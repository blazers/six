<span class="headword">Davidson,  Andrew Bruce</span>  (1831&#150;1902), <span class="occ">Hebraist and theologian</span>, was born on 25 April 1831 in the farmstead at Ellon, north Aberdeenshire, the son of Andrew Davidson (<i>d</i>. 1863) and Helen Bruce (<i>d</i>. 1876). His parents were keenly interested in the ecclesiastical and theological controversies that were to lead to the Disruption of 1843 and the founding of the Free Church of Scotland, and Davidson was consequently brought up, from the age of twelve, in the Free Church, which he served for the whole of his life. He went to Aberdeen grammar school in 1845, and in 1846 he entered Marischal College, Aberdeen; he graduated in 1849.<br>
<br>After teaching at the Free Church school in Ellon, Davidson entered the Free Church college in Edinburgh, New College, in 1852, and during his four years there he visited the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where he studied under H. G. A. Ewald. In 1856 he was licensed as a preacher and in 1858 he became an assistant at New College to the professor of Hebrew, John Duncan (1796&#150;1870), whom he succeeded as professor of Hebrew and oriental languages in 1863. He held the post until his death. From 1870 to 1884 he was a member of the committee that produced the Revised Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His scholarship was recognized by the award of several honorary degrees: LLD, Aberdeen (1868); DD, Edinburgh (1868) and Glasgow (1901); and LittD, Cambridge (1900).<br>
<br>While in some ways enigmatic, Davidson was an important transitional figure in the history of biblical scholarship in Britain. His views on critical matters were sufficiently traditional and orthodox in their account of recent criticism to allay any suspicions about his suitability for the chair at New College. At the same time he did not close the door to biblical criticism, and the first volume of his commentary on <span class="roman">Job</span> (1862) was a landmark in British scholarship. It was a profound exegesis of the text rather than a doctrinal tract, and it was mildly critical in tone. However, the rapidly moving tide of criticism in the 1860s and 1870s raised considerable problems for Davidson, who was quoted as saying, &#145;I dislike the old, I distrust the new&#146;  (Strahan, 108).<br>
<br>Several of Davidson's pupils published the notes taken at his lectures, but the most interesting are the unpublished notes of his most distinguished and most controversial pupil, William Robertson Smith. These show that in 1868&#150;9 Davidson was combining elements of traditional Scottish orthodoxy with the mildly critical positions of German scholars such as G. F. Oehler and F. A. G. Tholuck. Davidson also mentioned more radical critical views and clearly kept in touch with the latest developments, but he taught within a theological framework shared by Oehler, Tholuck, and his teacher, Ewald. This presented the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> as a record of God's progressive self-revelation, each stage of which was suited to the receptive ability of the Israelites. However, the version of this position adopted by Davidson could not easily contain the radical implications of the theories of K. H. Graf and Abraham Kuenen, and, later, Julius Wellhausen, which placed the prophets before the law, and when Robertson Smith was put on trial by the Free Church for advocating such views Davidson failed to declare himself openly to be on Smith's side.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Davidson became cautiously more critical, especially in articles for James Hastings's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span>; but by then the critical cause had been largely won. Davidson's apparent ambivalence has occasioned sharply differing verdicts. To some he was a disappointment, left behind by the tide of criticism that he had helped to begin. For others his caution in distrusting the new was justified, and he was praised for having helped to produce a generation of younger critical scholars.<br>
<br>Davidson was a consummate Hebraist and his <span class="italic">Introductory Hebrew Grammar</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">Hebrew Syntax</span> (1894) have taught generations of students, with revised editions, for more than a hundred years. His great love of Hebrew prophecy was exemplified in his commentaries on <span class="roman">Ezekiel</span> (1892), <span class="roman">Nahum</span>, <span class="roman">Habakkuk</span>, and <span class="roman">Zephaniah</span> (1896), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">Old Testament Prophecy</span> (1903). This last work, together with his <span class="italic">Theology of the Old Testament</span> (1904), was not prepared for publication by Davidson himself, and the value of these as a guide to his thought has been disputed.<br>
<br>In appearance Davidson was small and slight, needing spectacles for long distances and able without them to read the smallest print. His genuine modesty was epitomized by the fact that he constantly reminded his friends that he was not the great Dr Samuel Davidson but only A. B. Davidson of New College, Edinburgh. However, for all his modesty and his undemonstrative nature he was a riveting lecturer, and in his quiet, unassuming way he helped to change the face of <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> scholarship in Britain. He died, unmarried, in Edinburgh, on 20 January 1902.<br>
