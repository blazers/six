<span class="headword">Symson <span class="st"> [Simson]</span>,  Andrew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1638&#150;1712), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and printer</span>, was the youngest son of Andrew Symson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1601), author of a <span class="italic">Lexicon Anglo-Graeco-Latinum</span> (1658) and of several Biblical commentaries. Probably born in England, Symson attended the high school of Edinburgh and graduated MA from the University of Edinburgh on 19 July 1661. After teaching as Latin master at the high school of Stirling, he was licensed to preach by the bishop of Edinburgh on 23 January 1663 and dispatched to south-west Scotland to fill one of the numerous vacancies that had arisen following controversial legislation passed in 1662 obliging all established clergy to seek gentry patronage and episcopal collation.<br>
<br>Although Symson described his own entry to the parish of Kirkinner in Wigtownshire as &#145;so peaceable, so orderly &amp; so generally assented to&#146; that he encountered little initial opposition  (Symson, <span class="italic">Tripatriarchicon</span>, preface, sig. A4<i>r</i>), Galloway remained the geographical focus for sectarian division and presbyterian nonconformist disaffection throughout the Restoration. In 1679, for example, when &#145;things were come to that hight, that the publick owning of us, was almost look'd on as a crime&#146;  (ibid., 6), Symson acknowledged his good fortune in receiving protection from one of his former fellow university students, Alexander Stewart, third earl of Galloway. As civil unrest continued, Symson was also obliged to supply the government with lists of the &#145;disorderly&#146; in his parish, which in 1684 included the name of Margaret Lauchlinson, one of the notorious &#145;Wigtown Martyrs&#146;. At the beginning of 1686 he left Kirkinner and was admitted to the parish of Douglas.<br>
<br>In response to Sir Robert Sibbald's appeal for assistance in the production of a Scottish atlas, Symson had earlier begun work on his &#145;Large description of Galloway&#146;. Obliged to leave Douglas during the revolution of 1689, Symson settled at Dalclithick, in Glenartney, Perthshire, where he found &#145;time and leasure enough&#146; in 1692 to revise the work  (Symson, <span class="italic">Large Description</span>, preface), effectively producing a miniature statistical account of the region, recording, <i>inter alia</i>, supernatural phenomena alongside traditional farming methods. Although Sibbald later acknowledged his satisfaction with Symson's &#145;full acount&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 76), it was not until 1823 that the work was first edited and published.<br>
<br>Relinquishing the ministry after the re-establishment of presbyterianism, Symson moved to Edinburgh where he set up a printing house in the Cowgate. Acknowledging that books were &#145;my delight, my heart, worth nectar and ambrosia&#146;, he claimed in 1696 that surrounded &#145;with walls of books on all sides, I dwell safe as in a fortress&#146;  (Symson, <span class="italic">Octupla</span>, preface). In 1699 he arranged the publication of the second edition of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh's <span class="italic">Laws and Customs of Scotland in Matters Criminal</span>, having formerly acted as Mackenzie's amanuensis when the work was first published in 1678. In addition to presenting books to the university libraries of Glasgow and Edinburgh, he welcomed the recent foundation of the Faculty of Advocates' library, promising that if he came across volumes of particular interest, he would &#145;have them transplanted from my obscure Nursery to your more publick and pleasant Garden&#146;  (Symson, &#145;Preface&#146;, sig. A2<i>r</i>). In 1705 Symson published his <span class="italic">Tripatriarchicon</span>, an epic poem of over 4000 lines which incorporated an allegorical account of his time in Galloway within its narrative of the lives of the three Jewish patriarchs. Together with the <span class="italic">Tripatriarchicon</span>, which he hoped would &#145;pass among the judicious for a tolerably good trotting poem&#146;  (Symson, <span class="italic">Tripatriarchicon</span>, sig. A<i>v</i>), Symson also published elegies on notable Galloway personages, including Mrs Janet Dalrymple, Lady Baldone, who later inspired the character of Lucy Ashton in Sir Walter Scott's novel, <span class="italic">The Bride of Lammermoor</span>, as well as on the murdered Archbishop Sharp, and on the vigorous anti-covenanter Sir George Mackenzie.<br>
<br>By his marriage to Jane Inglis, Symson had three sons, the second of whom, David, was appointed historiographer royal for Scotland in 1708, while the youngest, Matthias, worked with his father as a printer before becoming successively rector of Moorby and canon of Lincoln, as well as the author of several works on geographical, religious, and historical subjects. Symson died on 20 January 1712 in Edinburgh and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard. Following the publication of a catalogue entitled <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Symsoniana</span>, his collection of over 4000 books was sold by lottery and auction.<br>
