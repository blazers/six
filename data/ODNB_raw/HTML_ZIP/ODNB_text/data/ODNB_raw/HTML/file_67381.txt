<span class="headword">Shepherd,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1677&#150;1694), <span class="occ">merchant and conspirator</span>, was active in the City of London from at least 1677. Nothing is known of Shepherd's origins or family. A liveryman of the Mercers' Company, he imported wine from Portugal and the Canary Islands, and linen and whale products from Hamburg.<br>
<br>Shepherd was an Independent in religion, probably a follower of the Independent divine Robert Ferguson. His signature on the May 1679 London petition on behalf of a protestant succession appeared adjacent to those of fellow Independent merchants George Boddington and Edward Bushell. By 1680&#150;81 he was &#145;looked upon as a man of the greatest interest in the City&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 327). His substantial residence in London's Abchurch Lane was a frequent whig meeting-place, and he also possessed a country seat at Bromley. Shepherd served on the common council for Candlewick ward in 1681, and in May of that year he offered to serve as sheriff of London and Middlesex. When the civic electorate chose other whig sheriffs for 1681&#150;2, Shepherd was instead elected city bridgemaster. He was impanelled with whig colleagues for the London grand jury in August 1681, and he served on the special jury that rejected the government's treason case against the earl of Shaftesbury in November of that year.<br>
<br>When Shaftesbury and other leading whigs plotted against Charles II in autumn 1682, they turned to Shepherd as their principal city agent. He may have been a relative of the earl's gentleman servant, Anthony Shepherd. He helped Shaftesbury find secret lodging when the earl went underground, and he was regarded as &#145;the only honest man in London to be entrusted with a bank of money&#146; to finance a rebellion  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683&#150;4</i>, 227). A critical meeting of the duke of Monmouth, Lord William Russell, Ford, Lord Grey, Sir Thomas Armstrong, Colonel John Rumsey, and Robert Ferguson took place at Shepherd's city house in early November 1682. According to Grey and Ferguson, those in attendance agreed to stage an insurrection on 19 November to check what they perceived as a drift towards arbitrary rule. Grey recalled that Shepherd was helpful in identifying places in the city that would need to be secured. During the evening Alderman Henry Cornish, a cloth factor with whom Shepherd regularly did business, made a brief appearance. These plans for revolt came to nothing, however, when a second gathering at Shepherd's house concluded that preparations could not be completed in time.<br>
<br>Shepherd remained a pivotal figure in the plotting that continued on the margins of the London whig movement until June 1683. He was in touch with Algernon Sidney and a group of whig grandees who conspired against Charles, beginning in January 1683. After receiving a letter from Shepherd, Robert Ferguson, who had fled with Shaftesbury to the Netherlands, returned to England and to plotting. Shepherd was intimate with attorney Robert West's conspiratorial cabal: they divulged to him their plan to assassinate Charles at the Rye House in Hertfordshire. Shepherd claimed to have discouraged this design out of respect for Monmouth, who may have desired the throne, but who did not desire his father's death. Shepherd also acted as intermediary between Monmouth and a group of disaffected Scotsmen, including the earl of Argyll, who hoped to organize a Scottish rebellion. They intended to lodge their funds with Shepherd, but Shepherd later denied having received any money from them. Lord Grey, on the other hand, subsequently suggested that Shepherd had received money from Russell that was intended for Argyll. Indeed, Grey thought Shepherd had raised money from Cornish and other citizens by threatening to accuse them unless they contributed.<br>
<br>After the disclosure of whig plotting to the government, Shepherd surrendered. He utilized his loyalist kinsman Sir Nathaniel Johnson to intercede for a pardon in exchange for his testimony, said to have been &#145;the most particular account&#146; among the early confessions  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>Jan&#150;June 1683</i>, 348). Shepherd gave evidence about Lord Russell's presence at his house during the plotting of November 1682. As a business acquaintance of Algernon Sidney, he was called upon to verify that the manuscript of the <span class="italic">Discourses Concerning Government</span> was in Sidney's hand. He also provided a deposition for the Scottish trial of Robert Baillie of Jerviswood.<br>
<br>Contemporary characterizations of Shepherd's role in the whig treason trials differ. Gilbert Burnet was highly critical of Shepherd's testimony about Lord Russell, and Colonel Thomas Walcott blamed his capture and death on Shepherd. Roger North remembered that Shepherd had been rebuffed by Charles II in offering to spy on his former associates on condition that his co-operation with the government was kept secret  (North, 383). On the other hand, Lord Grey, who may have been involved in a plan to silence Shepherd by having him murdered, also credited Shepherd with not fully divulging evidence against &#145;several of our best and ablest friends&#146;  (Grey, 74). In fact, the government suspected that Shepherd had not been fully forthcoming. He appeared on behalf of Henry Cornish in the alderman's 1685 trial and insisted, despite close questioning, that Cornish had been unaware of the plotting underway during his visit to Shepherd's house in November 1682.<br>
<br>Shepherd continued to trade after the whig treason trials, but he was much less visible in the city. He was confined with other leading London whigs and dissenters at the time of Monmouth's rebellion, but quickly released upon the order of James II. In 1689 he was among those London citizens who lent money to William of Orange, both before and after William's elevation to the English throne. He was probably the Thomas Shepherd who purchased &pound;2000 of the original stock of the Bank of England in 1694 and who also owned some &pound;4000 of East India Company stock. Shepherd is untraceable thereafter.<br>
