<span class="headword">George III,  daughters of</span>  (<em>act. </em>1766&#150;1857), <span class="occ"></span>were born over a period of seventeen years to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10540/', "George III (1738&#150;1820)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5162/', "Queen Charlotte (1744&#150;1818)")</script>. The six daughters in the family of fifteen children lived predominantly secluded and undistinguished lives; the reluctance of their parents to allow them to marry denied them even the dynastic significance generally accorded to the daughters of royal houses.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_5161"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Augusta Matilda</span>, princess royal  (1766&#150;1828), <span class="occ">queen of W&uuml;rttemberg, consort of Friedrich I</span>, was the eldest daughter and fourth child, born at Buckingham House, London, on 29 September 1766.

In the next five years Queen Charlotte bore three sons; <a name="cosubject_18254"></a><span class="headword">Princess Mary</span>, duchess of Gloucester  (1776&#150;1857)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 25 April 1776, <a name="cosubject_42012"></a><span class="headword">Princess Sophia</span>  (1777&#150;1848)<span class="occ"></span>, the next year, on 3 November. <a name="cosubject_437"></a><span class="headword">Princess Amelia</span>  (1783&#150;1810)<span class="occ"></span>, the youngest daughter and last child, made her appearance on 7 August 1783, between the deaths of her two youngest brothers, Alfred (1780&#150;1782) and Octavius (1779&#150;1783).<h2>
<a name="Familylife"></a>Family life</h2>The family life of the daughters of George III was not, prior to the king's first serious illness in 1788, an unhappy one. They were spared the strict educational regime and harsh discipline which fell to the lot of their brothers, and under the supervision of a well-loved governess, Lady Charlotte Finch, received lessons in English, French, geography, music, and art. In art Princess Elizabeth shone: her series of pictures &#145;The Birth and Triumph of Cupid&#146; (1795) was engraved by Tomkins and published at the king's expense, and reissued as &#145;The Birth and Triumph of Love&#146; in 1796. Twenty-four of her sketches, &#145;The Power and Progress of Genius&#146;, were issued in 1806. The princesses were allowed to play sports and boisterous games with their brothers, to whom they were close: the prince of Wales in particular was idolized by his sisters, and he was to prove their lifelong friend and protector.<br>
<br>Despite (or perhaps because of) the size of her family Queen Charlotte was not benignly maternal, and her daughters were scared of her, while the king was highly emotionally attached to them, preferring them to his sons, and was reluctant for them to marry and leave home. The king's illness in 1788&#150;9, which resulted in frightening bouts of mental aberration and delusions, cast a long shadow over the lives of the young princesses. He was to experience further attacks in 1801 and 1804, and it became increasingly difficult for the question of the marriage of any of his daughters to be broached. The queen feared that any such discussion would precipitate a breakdown in his health, and she was herself determined to keep her daughters about her. Thus it was that the sisters, eager to marry and attractive in youth (the elder three inherited the family tendency to corpulence), were kept at home in the &#145;Nunnery&#146;.<h2>
<a name="EscapingtheNunnery"></a>Escaping the Nunnery</h2>A succession of foreign princes made tentative attempts to become suitors to the princesses, but most of their offers were repelled by the queen, and many were not even passed on to the potential brides. Charlotte, the princess royal, whom the queen held responsible for the conduct of her sisters (who in turn regarded her as a &#145;tell-tale&#146;), was the first to succeed in marrying. In 1796 an offer was made by Prince Friedrich of W&uuml;rttemberg (1754&#150;1816), a 42-year-old widower whose first wife had died in suspicious circumstances; the king gave reluctant consent to the match, and the wedding took place on 18 May 1797. The groom was extremely fat, and the wits and cartoonists of the day had great fun with the &#145;Great Belly-gerent&#146; and his plump bride. The marriage was happy, but the only child, a daughter, was stillborn. Friedrich succeeded as duke of W&uuml;rttemberg later in 1797, and assumed the title of elector in 1803 and king in 1806: Charlotte enjoyed her new status as consort to a ruler, addressing her mother as &#145;Ma tr&egrave;s ch&egrave;re M&egrave;re et Soeur&#146; (&#145;My dearest Mother and Sister&#146;), to her mother's horror as W&uuml;rttemberg's promotions were the result of support for Napoleonic France. When W&uuml;rttemberg became a satellite of the French empire its queen was technically an enemy of her native country until her husband adroitly, if belatedly, switched sides again in December 1813.<br>
<br>The princess royal's escape from the Nunnery did not open the way to marriages for her sisters. As all, except perhaps Princess Mary, were warmly sexual by nature, and wished for children, their position was unenviable. In their confined world they sought romance with the few men that they met frequently, principally courtiers and equerries. A pattern developed of clandestine love affairs, which caused rumours of secret marriages and illegitimate children. Having seen her potential suitors turned away, Princess Augusta, the most extrovert of the sisters, fell in love with an equerry, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26116/', "Major-General Sir Brent Spencer (1760&#150;1828)")</script>; she revealed her feelings to the prince of Wales, and in 1812, after he had become regent, attempted to gain his support for a private marriage. It has been suggested that this marriage did take place, but there is no evidence supporting the assertion. Princess Amelia, the king's favourite daughter, was always in poor health: from the age of fifteen it was clear that she had tuberculosis. In 1801 she was sent to Weymouth for her health; there she was attended by another of the king's equerries, Colonel Charles Fitzroy (1762&#150;1831), second son of Lord Southampton. She quickly fell in love with him, and thereafter never gave up hope of marrying him. She told her brother, the duke of York, that she considered herself married, and took to using the initials A. F. R. (Amelia FitzRoy). Her own death intervened to thwart her plan of marrying Fitzroy after the king's death.<br>
<br>Princess Sophia, denied the opportunity to marry, became greatly attached to yet another equerry, Major-General Thomas Garth (1744&#150;1829). He was aged fifty-six, and his face was disfigured by a large purple birthmark, leading him to be called unkindly &#145;the purple light of love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, 3.465) by her sister Mary. It is possible that they went through some form of marriage, but they never lived together openly; a child was born to Sophia late in the summer of 1800. There were also allegations that the child was the result of an incestuous union with Sophia's brother Ernest, duke of Cumberland, used in the press to denounce the unpopular duke. The child, also called Thomas Garth, was brought up by Garth at Weymouth. In 1828&#150;9 the son attempted to blackmail the royal family by producing incriminating papers he had obtained from his father. He died in 1875.<br>
<br>The stout Princess Elizabeth (known to her sisters as Fatima), whose great love of children made it all the more sad that she did not marry until she was forty-eight, sought the support of George, prince of Wales [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10541/', "George IV")</script>] in her desire to marry and escape her family. In 1808 she desperately wanted to accept the offer of marriage made by the duke of Orl&eacute;ans (later King Louis Philippe of France), but her hopes were confounded by his Catholicism and the queen's opposition.<h2>
<a name="Regencyandrevolt"></a>Regency and revolt</h2>The sisters frequently called on the prince of Wales to assist them in finding husbands, in marrying their lovers, or simply in escaping from the confined life they lived in the queen's household. The help he could offer was limited before the regency: Princess Amelia's death after two years of permanent invalidity on 2 November 1810 came too early for him to be able to help her marry Colonel Fitzroy. (Indeed, it was the harrowing news of his daughter's last illness and death which seems to have contributed to the final collapse of the king's health, thus precipitating the regency.) On becoming regent the prince of Wales improved the position of his four remaining unmarried sisters by increasing their allowances, and supporting their wish to be allowed out into society. The princesses themselves planned a revolt against their restricted way of life under their mother's authority: Princess Augusta took the lead in April 1812 when they sent four letters to their mother asking for more freedom. The queen's reaction was one of horror and outrage, and it took all the prince regent's tact to effect a reconciliation between mother and daughters which gave the latter some degree of independence.<br>
<br>This enhanced independence resulted in two further marriages, those of Mary and Elizabeth. Princess Mary was perhaps the most physically attractive of the sisters, with an affectionate, rather than an actively sexual, nature. &#145;Dearest Minny&#146; had been the devoted nurse and companion of Princess Amelia during her last illness, and no rumours or scandals had attached themselves to her name. Like her sisters she resented the restrictions of her mother's household, and her marriage on 22 July 1816 to her cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29457/', "Prince William Frederick, second duke of Gloucester (1776&#150;1834)")</script>, should be seen in this light. Despite early assurances from the princess that she was content, their married life at Bagshot Park does not seem to have been entirely happy. Gloucester proved to be something of a domestic tyrant, while his political radicalism made relations with Mary's beloved brother, the regent, difficult. They had no children. Marriage for Princess Elizabeth in 1818 seemed unlikely; but in that year she was informed of an offer made by Prince Friedrich of Hesse-Homburg (1769&#150;1829) (he had been suggested as a husband for Princess Augusta fourteen years earlier). She could no longer hope for children, but wished to have her own home, and thankfully accepted the prince, although he was a less than prepossessing figure. Queen Charlotte, after much grumbling, ungraciously gave her consent, and the wedding took place on 7 April 1818 at St James's Palace. The marriage appears to have been a great success. The princess's jointure enabled the couple to repair the dilapidated castles of Hesse-Homburg, and in 1820 Friedrich succeeded his father as landgrave.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>The death of Queen Charlotte in November 1818 liberated her two remaining unmarried daughters, Augusta and Sophia, but their freedom came too late, and neither married. Augusta attended her mother during her final illness, and on her father's death she moved into Frogmore House, near Windsor, which she had been given. She remained close to her brothers, frequently visiting both <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10541/', "George IV")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29451/', "William IV")</script>, and was a companion to the latter's wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/162/', "Adelaide")</script>, during the early years of her widowhood. Princess Augusta lived into the reign of her niece <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36652/', "Victoria")</script>, who spoke affectionately of her. She died at Clarence House, St James's, on 22 September 1840. Princess Sophia lived in Kensington Palace after Queen Charlotte's death, in close proximity to the duchess of Kent and the young Princess Victoria. Like the duchess she fell under the influence of Sir John Conroy, who took over her finances; this friendship alienated her from Victoria, who thought her a spy. Following her death at her house in Vicarage Place, Kensington, on 27 May 1848, it became apparent that Conroy had embezzled most of her money. She was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>The married sisters, Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Mary, all survived their husbands by some years. The king of W&uuml;rttemberg died in 1816, and the Dowager Queen Charlotte remained in his kingdom, visiting England only in 1827, when, grotesquely fat, she came in search of medical treatment for dropsy, and was entertained by George IV at Windsor. She died in W&uuml;rttemberg, at Ludwigsburg, on 6 October 1828, of an apoplectic seizure. The landgrave of Hesse-Homburg died in 1829, and his widow, Elizabeth, thereafter divided her time between Homburg and Hanover; she visited England in 1835&#150;6, and in her last years spent much of her time at spas. She died at Frankfurt am Main on 10 January 1840. Princess Mary, the duchess of Gloucester, was the last survivor of George III's children, living on until 30 April 1857. Following her death at Gloucester House, Piccadilly, Queen Victoria wrote: &#145;Her age, and her being a link with bygone times and generations &hellip; rendered her more and more dear and precious to us all, and we all looked upon her as a sort of grandmother&#146;  (Martin, 4.27).<br>
<br>The lives of these unexceptional but warm-hearted sisters had undoubtedly been marred by the possessiveness of George III, by the family calamity of his long illness, and by the selfishness of their mother, Queen Charlotte. Members of a family and social structure which gave them the sole function of marriage and childbirth, between them the six sisters produced only one living child, and he was illegitimate. The dull misery caused by the restriction of their lives at Windsor was summed up by Princess Elizabeth, on a kindness from the regent: &#145;tho' I do not expect to be <i>happy</i>, believe me, I shall be <i>content</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, 8.317).<br>
