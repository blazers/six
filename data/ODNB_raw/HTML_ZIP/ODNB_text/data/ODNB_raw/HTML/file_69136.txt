<span class="headword">Barnes,  Joseph</span>  (1549/50&#150;1618), <span class="occ">bookseller and printer</span>, was the son of Thomas Barnes, a husbandman of Long Wittenham, Berkshire. In 1562 he was apprenticed for ten years to Garbrand Harkes, a Dutch-born bookseller, vintner, and mercer in Oxford; Harkes was both a privileged member of the University of Oxford and (unusually for a member of the book trade) a freeman of the city. Barnes's apprenticeship was enrolled in the city's records rather than the university's, but he never took up city freedom, and was admitted as a bookseller by the university on 8 September 1573. Two years later he was granted a university licence to sell wine, and maintained both occupations throughout his career.<br>
<br>There had been a few short-lived attempts to establish printing at Oxford but, by the time that Barnes became a bookseller, no book had been printed in the city for over fifty years. Moreover, since 1557, printing in England had been restricted to members of the London Stationers' Company and those who held patents for printing from the crown. The University of Cambridge had received a grant in 1534 but Oxford could claim no such right. However, in 1584&#151;a year after Cambridge appointed a new university printer&#151;a draft petition was submitted to Oxford's chancellor, the earl of Leicester, in a bid to secure a privilege from the crown. It named Barnes as &#145;a substantial bookseller&#146; who was willing to print on behalf of the university if he were granted some specific privileges in his own right and the opportunity to sell his publications abroad  (Carter, 20). No privilege was forthcoming. None the less, the university believed it should proceed: in August Barnes was loaned &pound;100 to establish a press; in December a supervisory delegacy of scholars was appointed; and in January 1585 a single leaf, <span class="italic">In aduentum illustrissimi Lecestrensis comitis ad Collegium Lincolniense</span>, was printed by Barnes. The university's right to print was tacitly endorsed by a Star Chamber decree of 1586, which listed it and Cambridge as the only places where printing was allowed outside London; it was also reflected in a privy council action about the same time against London printers who had pirated an Oxford publication.<br>
<br>Barnes's printing house was not a &#145;university press&#146; in a modern sense. He styled himself &#145;printer to the university&#146; but the epithet appears on relatively few of his more than 260 imprints. The university offered no direct support, despite the fact that the &pound;100 loan was clearly inadequate for his needs. None the less, Barnes was &#145;an excellent printer&#146;: &#145;Oxford could not again until very recent times boast such a beautiful equipment of type&#146;  (Carter, 21). The absence of black letter and the inclusion of Greek type evidently reflected Barnes's humanist aspirations, and he published works by John Case and Alberico Gentili, both of whom had an international readership; Case's <span class="italic">Speculum quaestionum moralium</span> (1585) was advertised at the Frankfurt book fair. However, the economics of printing and Barnes's international inexperience limited such ambitions and, although there were classical publications, there were far more university verses and sermons. Barnes published the first printed catalogue of the Bodleian Library in 1605, but the experience was not a happy one; the Hebrew was inaccurate and poor, and the catalogue appeared with an errata list compiled by the professor of Hebrew at Leiden.<br>
<br>Barnes apprenticed his son, John, to a London bookseller in 1594 and, after John's freedom in 1601, he took advantage of his son's membership of the Stationers' Company to secure his rights over certain works. On 7 June 1602 John entered twelve items into the Stationers' register; one of them was Thomas Rider's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca scholastica</span>, an English&#150;Latin dictionary that Barnes had published in 1589. In December this work was re-entered on condition that it was only printed in London, and the following month John assigned it over to Cuthbert Burby. Another edition was published in Oxford in 1612, and in 1616 a chancery suit was brought to clarify that assignment of 1603. In November 1618, barely weeks before Barnes's death, father and son relinquished all claim to the work in return for &pound;60.<br>
<br>Barnes was married at least twice: Anne or Anna was buried in All Saints' Church in 1603; Barbara executed his will. He had at least three children: Robert, born in either 1576 or 1577, who became an Oxfordshire rector; John; and Anne, who married a physician and was buried in the same grave as her father in 1657. His brother Roger was a notable Oxford bookbinder.<br>
<br>Barnes held leases for a number of properties on Oxford's High Street. In 1601 he leased a tenement next to Brasenose College that would remain in the family until 1652. An inventory made at his death records two rooms for printing, one for storing paper, and a fourth for wine. It appears, though, that he had a separate bookshop and warehouse. In the late seventeenth century John Aubrey reported that college fellows used to go &#145;every satterday night &hellip; to Joseph Barnes shop the bookseller (opposite the west end of St Marys) where the Newes was brought from London&#146;  (Bennett, 51).<br>
<br>Barnes retired in January 1617, and was succeeded by William Wrench and John Lichfield. He died in Oxford on 6 December 1618, and was buried on 17 December in St Mary's Church, where Wood records a memorial. Barnes's age was there given as seventy-two, but university depositions from the 1570s onwards suggest he was born in 1549 or 1550. Barnes's will was proved in January 1619, and left money to the Bodleian Library and to Brasenose and Magdalen colleges. An inventory indicates a substantial estate of &pound;1128 2<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., including &pound;300 in bound and unbound books. However, Barnes's debts were even greater: between February 1619 and February 1621 his son John sold over a dozen of his father's &#145;copies&#146; to various members of the Stationers' Company, and in 1624 his widow and daughter were granted a university licence to sell wine.<br>
