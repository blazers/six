<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Muhammad Ali Khan Walahjah</span>  (<em>c.</em>1717&#150;1795), <span class="occ">nawab of Arcot</span>, was born the third of five sons of <a name="cosubject_75521"></a><span class="headword">Anwar ud-Din Khan</span>  (1674?&#150;1749)<span class="occ"></span>, whom Asaf Jah, the Mughal <i>subahdar</i> of the Deccan and first nizam of Hyderabad, appointed nawab (deputy) of his subordinate <i>subha</i> (province) of Arcot in 1743. But it was not an appointment which Anwar ud-Din or, later, his son ever found easy to hold.<br>
<br>Mughal imperial power had come late to the Deccan and peninsular India, following the conquests by the emperor Aurangzeb of the Bijapur and Golconda sultanates in 1685 and 1687 respectively. It rested uncomfortably on top of the locally constituted authority of a myriad of Hindu kings and chieftains, who continued to resist it. In addition, it faced rivalry from the expansion of the Maratha empire to the west, whose military forces regularly ravaged the region and, in 1689, conquered the Hindu kingdom of Tanjore to the south. A further problem arose after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, when the Mughal empire went into decline and many provincial governors asserted their autonomy from imperial control. Asaf Jah himself followed this course and attempted to establish Hyderabad as an independent regional state. But so, too, did the family of the original nawabs of Arcot. In 1710 Saadatullah Khan had been appointed nawab, and he subsequently struggled against the Marathas and local chieftains until his death in battle in 1732. Thereafter his extended family repudiated the Hyderabad connection and squabbled among themselves for succession to his office. In 1743 Asaf Jah marched south with a large army to restore order. He dismissed the various claimants from Saadatullah's line and appointed instead Anwar ud-Din Khan, who had distinguished himself previously in the nizam's service as a soldier and administrator and as nawab of Chicacole.<br>
<br>However, after Asaf Jah and his army returned north, Anwar ud-Din encountered serious difficulties in securing his authority. Saadatullah had been a Dakhni-speaking Muslim, drawn from the local Navaiyat community which had Shi&#145;i leanings and had long served the courts of Bijapur and Golconda. His relatives continued to hold many key military and civil positions. Anwar ud-Din, by contrast, was an Urdu-speaking Sunni Muslim from north India, whose strong connections among the pan-Indian Mughal &eacute;lite belied his isolation in the south. Revolt stirred quickly and came to centre on the person of Saadatullah's son-in-law Shams ud-Daula Husain Dost Khan, otherwise known as Chanda Sahib. Widely regarded as the most able general of his times, in 1749 Chanda Sahib put together an army of 40,000 men and laid claim to Arcot. During the resultant battle of Ambur, Chander received the support of the French under the governor of their East India Company at Pondicherry, Joseph-Fran&ccedil;ois, marquis de Dupleix. In opposition, the British&#151;albeit somewhat reluctantly&#151;found themselves supporting Anwar ud-Din. For the two contenders to the nawabi, the attraction of a European connection lay in the access which it provided to new military technologies, particularly those of disciplined musketry and rapid-fire field cannon, which initially proved devastating against Indian cavalry formations. Anwar ud-Din himself was killed in the battle on 3 August, leaving his son Muhammad Ali a very doubtful inheritance.<br>
<br>At first it scarcely seemed as if Anwar ud-Din and his lineage had chosen the right side. After their victory at Ambur, Chanda Sahib and the French were in the ascendant. In 1751 Muhammad Ali, who now laid claim to his father's title, was besieged at Trichinopoly and in imminent danger of defeat. However, in a manoeuvre of fateful import, the British then launched a diversionary expedition from Madras under the then little-known captain Robert Clive to attack Chander's capital at Arcot and force him to lift the Trichinopoly siege. Clive further proceeded to hold Arcot against Chander's counter-attack for sufficiently long both to establish his own military reputation and to allow the British time to recruit a broad compact of Indian allies against Chander. From that point the tide of war turned and Chanda Sahib was eventually run to ground and murdered at Trichinopoly in 1752.<br>
<br>So far as rival claimants from Saadatullah's line were concerned, Nawab Muhammad Ali was now secure in his occupation of Arcot. However, this scarcely put an end to his troubles. Two of his four brothers launched their own claims to the succession. More seriously, the authority of his regime continued to be resisted by the numerous petty Hindu chiefs (known to the British as &#145;poligars&#146;) who dominated the interior districts. Progress in bringing them to heel was slow and sometimes produced unforeseen consequences. From 1756 Muhammad Ali's leading general Yusuf Khan&#151;himself a convert to Islam from a poligar clan&#151;appeared to have gained the upper hand. But in 1760 Yusuf proclaimed himself independent of Arcot and attempted to set up his own kingdom centred on the ancient Hindu capital of Madura. This necessitated the sending of a second nawabi army to defeat Yusuf's first. It was not until after Muhammad Ali's death that the southern poligars were finally subjugated.<br>
<br>Externally, periodic threats continued to come from the Marathas and from Hyderabad. But greater and more persistent dangers were posed by the French and by the expansive claims of a revitalized Mysore state. Although French influence on the Coromandel coast was substantially reduced after the victory of Sir Eyre Coote at Wandiwash in 1760, it remained significant to the west, whence it was felt through the emergence of Mysore as an expansionary power. In 1758 the Hindu Wodeyar dynastic rulers of Mysore were displaced by their principal military commander, Haidar Ali Khan, who proclaimed himself sultan. Haidar and his son and successor Tipu Sultan, with great energy and ability, set about modernizing the Mysore regime and establishing it as a rising force in south India. From the first they looked to the Europeans for help, and initially turned towards the British. But the British company's servants at Madras were by now strongly committed to Muhammad Ali. Having been spurned, Haidar turned to the French. Mysore, with its French connections, now became the deadly rival of Arcot, with its British foundations. In Muhammad Ali's time the two states fought three major wars (1767&#150;9, 1780&#150;83, 1790&#150;92), in the first two of which Arcot came off very much the worse.<br>
<br>In the face of these vicissitudes, Muhammad Ali's simple expedient was to rely ever more heavily on the support of the British for arms and cash. The company supplied him with the bulk of his army, which consisted of British-trained mercenaries, and the company servants advanced him loans. However, these services came at a high price, which bore heavily on his revenues, themselves depleted by the political turmoil. He was also obliged to grant the company and its servants extensive trading privileges. Inevitably he fell into arrears, leading to the company's taking over direct administration of his domains. In 1763 he was obliged to grant the company a <i>jagir</i> (revenue assignment) for the Chingleput district surrounding Madras. After the disaster of the Second Anglo-Mysore War the revenues of other and larger stretches of territory were assigned, albeit supposedly on a temporary basis. In effect, the Arcot state became a puppet regime, notionally under the authority of its nawab but <i>de facto</i> administered by company officials. This situation lasted throughout the later stages of Muhammad Ali's reign, which ended with his death at Madras on 13 October 1795, and even the reign of his son and successor, Umdat al-Umara (<i>d</i>. 1801).<br>
<br>Muhammad Ali's bid to succeed his father as nawab of Arcot concluded in the establishment of the rule of the English East India Company in south India. In consequence he has frequently been portrayed as the victim of European imperialism&#151;which undoubtedly, in many ways, he was. However, a historical status merely as victim might obscure his own achievements both as a politician and as a practitioner of Indian statecraft. Given his alien origins and the turbulence of the times, it was remarkable that he should have established a state in south India at all, still less one which survived for fifty years and imprinted itself on cultural memory for very much longer. The nawabs of Bengal, who found themselves in a very similar political situation, were consigned to history as early as 1765. And the Walahjah family name continues to convey royal prestige in south Indian society today.<br>
<br>Muhammad Ali's rare survival owed much to his shrewd manipulation of the English company's administration, where he helped to create one of the greatest British political scandals of the later eighteenth century and for a long time to paralyse the ability of the nascent British imperial state to dispose of him. Beginning in the 1750s, in order to finance the heavy demands on him for cash, he took to borrowing money&#151;albeit at exorbitant rates of interest&#151;from the company's own servants in their &#145;private&#146; trading capacities. This created among company officials a network of interest in his own preservation, if only to ensure that they might get their money back, and revealed a major contradiction in the organization of the company's government between private and public policy.<br>
<br>The network also provided means by which Muhammad Ali was able to influence politics in London. Between 1771 and 1773 his agents among the company's servants in Madras were active in gaining initial support for a conquest of the neighbouring friendly state of Tanjore, simply to lay hand on its revenues and, in 1776, for arresting and imprisoning the Madras governor, Lord Pigot, who was charged by the directors with rescinding the conquest. Later still they entrapped Governor Sir Thomas Rumbold in a web of corruption and rendered the reform policies of Governor Lord Macartney largely ineffective. While the eventual rescinding of the Tanjore conquest perhaps shows the limits of Muhammad Ali's influence, the case also suggested the breadth of his connections. He was said to have had at least six members of parliament, associated with his creditors, firmly in his camp. The scandal of the Arcot debts was finally resolved only in 1805 when a parliamentary inquiry committee knocked down the creditors' claims from &pound;30 million to &pound;2.5 million. The inquiry followed the dynasty's eclipse, which itself reflected a stronger assertion of metropolitan authority in the context of the French revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. But Muhammad Ali was by then dead, having used the pressure of the debts to preserve his patrimony for nearly half a century, and, at his demise, still leaving his creditors largely unpaid. This might be regarded as a considerable triumph, albeit of a curious kind.<br>
<br>Less curious, however, was the way in which Muhammad Ali pursued the strategy of a post-Mughal state builder and fulfilled the aims of every founder of an Indian dynasty to establish the glory and prestige of his family name. Much of the cash, which he gleaned from his creditors, was used not to pay the company's demands, but to invest in cultural projects. At both Arcot and Madras he demonstrated his association with the new power of the Europeans by building magnificent palaces in the European style, drawing especially on the skills of Paul Benfield, who was a military architect and merchant&#151;and also his principal creditor. Muhammad Ali further employed a range of celebrated European artists resident in India, including George Willison. His address to local Muslim and Hindu audiences was more traditional. He distributed a lavish patronage to found mosques and attract Islamic scholars and he resolved the tensions with the Navaiyat community by (possibly in 1747) taking as his principal wife Khadija Begum, a Shi&#145;i from a highly respected Bijapur family. Their son Umdat al-Umara, who also professed Shi&#145;ism, was his anointed heir. With regard to his Hindu subjects, he followed the long-established conventions of south Indian kingship in protecting and endowing Hindu temples. His name became closely associated with the great temples of Tirupati and Rameswaram and with that of Sri Parthasarathi at Madras. In terms of Indian statecraft, he was supremely successful at securing the honour of his dynasty, which continued long after 1801 and even 1855, when, according to the British, the family lost its claim to all government revenues and to a royal title. As late as 1996 his descendants continued to open major religious festivals at the Sri Parthasarathi temple. Far from being merely a victim of European imperialism, Muhammad Ali used his European connections to gain immortality for his family name.<br>
