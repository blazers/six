<span class="headword">Throgmorton family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1409&#150;1518), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, held land at Fladbury in Throckmorton, Worcestershire, from the late twelfth century. They remained, however, no more than farmers from the bishopric of Worcester until the marriage in 1409 of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27392/', "John Throgmorton (d. 1445)")</script> to the coheir of Guy Spine of Coughton, west Warwickshire, greatly enhanced the family's standing. By this match the Throgmortons acquired the manor of Coughton, their first fee simple estate and their first Warwickshire property, and further land in Worcestershire. For much of the fifteenth century the family's history was bound up with that of the earls of Warwick, whose estate, like the Throgmortons', was centred on Warwickshire and Worcestershire. John's father, <a name="cosubject_63914"></a><span class="headword">Thomas (I) Throgmorton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1411)<span class="occ"></span>, and Thomas's father-in-law, Alexander Besford of Besford, Worcestershire, had both served Thomas Beauchamp, the appellant earl of Warwick, as had John's father-in-law, Guy Spine, and it may well have been the Warwick connection that secured the Spine match for John. But none of the family was ever to be as close or important to the earls as John was to Richard Beauchamp from 1416 to the earl's death in 1439. John's son and heir, <a name="cosubject_63915"></a><span class="headword">Thomas (II) Throgmorton</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1472)<span class="occ"></span>, was a life annuitant and officer of Richard Neville, the eventual heir to the Warwick earldom, but he retained the connections with lords Sudeley and Beauchamp of Powick that his father had forged during the period of Beauchamp minorities from 1439 to 1449, while Thomas (II)'s son and heir, <a name="cosubject_63916"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Throgmorton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1451&#150;1518)<span class="occ"></span>, never formalized ties with George, duke of Clarence, the last effective earl of Warwick. While none of John's successors seems to have had the professional legal training that enabled John to found the family's fortunes, both Thomas (II) and Robert apparently knew enough law to be valued as agents by their noble, clerical, and gentry neighbours. In particular, like other associates of the earls of Warwick from the west midlands, members of the family acted as officials to the bishops of Worcester for much of the century.<br>
<br>Whether close or not to the earls of Warwick, the Throgmortons played a central role in the networks of west-midland gentry which, although they had their own internal dynamics, tended to look to the earls for leadership and then to the earls' successors, the crown. Throgmortons often intermarried with other midland families, like Russell, Gifford, Knightley, and Peyto. Thomas (II) married Margaret, daughter and heir of Robert Onley of Birdingbury, Warwickshire, and Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire, and, although Robert married Katherine, daughter of William Marrowe, alderman of London, it is significant that Katherine's brother had already married the heiress of another Warwickshire family.<br>
<br>The family was buying land all through the fifteenth century. John's several purchases included the Warwickshire manor of Spernall in 1441&#150;3, and he was able to secure recognition of the title to Throckmorton as a hereditary fee-farm by the bishop in 1418. Thomas (II)'s most notable purchase was the other half of Coughton from the coheirs, the Tracys, in 1449. By Thomas's death the family owned property in a large number of places in Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Buckinghamshire. Although Robert Onley outlived Thomas (II), Robert Throgmorton was eventually to inherit the Onley estates. Despite the importance of Coughton in the family's rise, the greater part of the estate lay in Worcestershire and so, although Throgmortons held all the significant local offices, they tended to serve more often in Worcestershire than Warwickshire until the time of Robert. In 1474 Robert effected a rearrangement with his widowed mother of the lands willed to her for life by his father. By this, he transferred the weight of his interests to Warwickshire and it is no accident that he was the first of the family to serve the king predominantly in Warwickshire nor that he reputedly undertook the substantial rebuilding of Coughton which occurred in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.<br>
<br>Despite the Throgmortons' high profile in local office and local politics, they contrived to remain largely unscathed by the traumas of fifteenth-century local and national politics. Chiefly this was because they were adept at keeping sufficiently broad connections with the local nobility to be able to find a bolt-hole in times of national trouble and because they were usually remarkably good at keeping out of local disputes in the periods of local disorder caused by weak kingship, ineffective noble leadership, or both. In the late 1450s, when the connection with the earl of Warwick was becoming dangerous, Thomas (II) managed to exploit his link to Sudeley and Beauchamp of Powick to keep in with those around Henry VI and was even made attorney to the prince of Wales in 1457. He was then able to use the Warwick connection to escape any vengeance from the triumphant Yorkists; by 1464 he had been restored to the Worcestershire commission of the peace and in 1465 became a JP in Warwickshire. He evaded official duty during the readeption, while his son managed to serve Edward IV, Richard III, and Henry VII as local officer in quick succession&#151;and was indeed Henry's first sheriff in Warwickshire. Characteristically avoiding more than a passing implication in the disputes which increasingly convulsed Warwickshire in the first ten years of Henry VII [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52788/', "Mountford family")</script>], Robert eventually became closer to the inner circles of Henry's court than almost any of his west midland neighbours. He was made KB at the creation of the duke of York in 1494 (the first of the family to be knighted), turned out for the king to resist Perkin Warbeck at Blackheath in 1497, and was the recipient of a certain amount of royal favour in the last decade of the reign. The obverse was that, from 1502, he was also caught up in Henry's notorious system of bonds and recognizances. Both the greater proximity to the king and the recognizances are partly attributable to the match made in 1501 for Robert's son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38067/', "George Throckmorton or Throgmorton")</script>, with Katherine, the heir apparent of Sir Nicholas Vaux, one of Henry's closer associates. It was a cadet branch, the Throgmortons of Haresfield, Gloucestershire, that lacked the political acumen of the main line: John (i), Thomas (II)'s younger brother, was executed after fighting for the Lancastrians at Mortimer's Cross in 1461, while John (i)'s son and heir, John (ii), fought for the Lancastrians at Tewkesbury but was later pardoned.<br>
<br>The Throgmortons' religious dispositions followed the pattern of their political and official activities: concentration on Worcestershire until Robert and thereafter on Coughton. The family burials and chantry at Fladbury [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27392/', "Throgmorton, John")</script>] were complemented by the annuities for chantry priests that Thomas (II) and his widowed mother gave to Evesham and Pershore abbeys in 1448. Robert was probably the first of the family to wish to be buried at Coughton. The chancel of Coughton parish church was under reconstruction when he died and in his will he left precise instructions for the glazing of the east windows. The centrepiece of this detailed and fairly lavish will was a chantry in the church, which was to double as a school to teach the children of Robert's tenants. An elaborate tomb had been prepared for him in Coughton but he died in Rome on his way to the Holy Land.<br>
<br>The Throgmortons have left little evidence of their estate management but enough to see that they were probably as careful in this as in their other enterprises. Although Thomas (I) bought a salt pit in Worcestershire in 1402 and Thomas (II) enclosed some pasture, the family seems to have operated a mainly <i>rentier</i> economy for most of the century. It helped that, as valued officials of the bishops of Worcester, they were able to build up &pound;240 of rent arrears to the bishopric between 1440 and 1470, nearly all of which was eventually cancelled. It was Robert who was apparently the first to exploit the growing market for wool in the later fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. The exchange with his mother gave him a compact estate, suitable for sheep farming; he added to it by further purchases and exchanges and enclosed pastures as well as woods and parkland.<br>
<br>Throughout the century the Throgmortons evinced a combination of enterprise and circumspection more readily associated at this time with gentry families in the process of establishing themselves than with those that were already among the leaders of local society, as the family certainly was by the time of John's death. This explains why, unusually, they were able to continue their rise without set-back through three generations in a period that was politically dangerous and, until the late fifteenth century, economically unpromising. It was in the sixteenth century that they lost their ability to keep on the winning side: two sons of Robert, who had been with him in Rome at his death, died at the battle of Pavia in 1525; the family remained steadfastly Catholic after the Reformation and their seat of Coughton was sacked twice during the upheavals of the seventeenth century. Nevertheless, they continued owners of Coughton until the National Trust acquired the house in 1948. The Throgmorton arms were gules, a chevron argent, with three gimel bars sable thereon.<br>
