<span class="headword">Season,  Henry</span>  (1693&#150;1775), <span class="occ">almanac writer and medical practitioner</span>, was born on 23 January 1693, in the village of Broomham (now Bromham), near Chippenham in Wiltshire. His mother died in childbirth, and he was raised by his maternal grandmother, who also provided his early education. By the age of five he was reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but he was not able to enter into full-time education, being obliged to earn a living early on. By the age of eleven he was employed in &#145;a mechanick business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span>, 1734, A2<i>r</i>), spending his spare time reading in divinity, history, and philosophy, and writing poetry. At seventeen he joined his father in London for four months, working as an assistant funeral undertaker. However, he disliked metropolitan life and soon returned to settle in Bones Lane, Broomham. By now, encouraged by the local squire, John Nicholson, he was studying physic and astronomy, to which he then added astrology.<br>
<br>Season described himself as a &#145;licenced Physician and surgeon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span>, 1751, title-page). It seems that about 1721 he agreed (though not without initial misgivings) to take over from the deceased local physician. He found that it suited him, and maintained for the rest of his life an evidently successful medical practice which included the sale of various powders, tinctures, and remedies. For purposes of both diagnosis and prescription, he availed himself of the ancient tradition of medical, herbal, and humoral astrology, thus integrating his studies of astronomy and cosmology with those of physic. Of more recent authorities, he drew some comfort and sanction from the theories of Richard Mead concerning planetary effects, via the earth's atmosphere, on disease.<br>
<br>Season combined his medical practice with that of straightforward judicial astrologer, giving astral advice on personal problems. In that role he was respected and feared by the village commoners as a cunning- or wise-man, or &#145;conjurer&#146;&#151;an appellation that irritated Season, who saw his astrology as perfectly consistent with Anglican Christianity and reason. While admitting that the superstition of both some astrologers and their clients had resulted in casting magic spells and the like&#151;while many others &#145;do ridicule an Art they are entirely ignorant of&#146;&#151;he stoutly maintained that &#145;The ancient Astrology is a Branch of natural Philosophy, no way inconsistent or impugned by Scripture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span>, 1774, C2<i>r</i>&#150;3<i>r</i>). He thus rejected the more openly divinatory and inexplicable practices such as elections (choosing the most propitious time to begin an enterprise) and horary judgements (answering a query on the basis of the planetary positions at the time of its asking, or reception by the astrologer), and derided overly precise predictions as crude and illegitimate. Thanks to such degeneracy, he complained, astrologers now were &#145;scarce ever half so much rewarded or regarded as a French Cook, Italian Songster, or even an English Dapper-witted Dancing-master&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span>, 1751, A2).<br>
<br>In 1732 Season was offered the editorship of an annual almanac, hitherto produced by Thomas Lane, called <span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span>. He accepted, and from his first issue (for 1733) until his last (for 1774) stamped his own distinctive personality on a frequently bland and repetitive medium in a way that is the reason why he still has, and deserves, our attention. It certainly seems to have received that of his contemporaries, including the back-handed compliment of an abusive attack on &#145;Nostradamus Season&#146;, as &#145;an illiterate scurrilous Quack&#146;, in the 1756 edition of the anti-astrological almanac <span class="italic">Poor Robin</span>.<br>
<br>The typical <span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span> consisted principally of a rather idiosyncratic chronology, from ancient times until the present; an &#145;Enigma&#146;, challenging readers for its resolution, with successful answers to be carried the next year; a section in which the astronomical and astrological phenomena for each day of the year were presented, and their implications, whether social or natural, briefly discussed; and a few pages devoted to a topic of Season's choice. The whole was leavened with his forceful reflections and assertions. In religion, he was vigorously Anglican. This adherence entailed no contradiction with his astrology: &#145;All Eclipses, great Conjunctions, Comets and Configurations of Planets, are all Oracles of Divine Providence; which, whosoever despiseth, contemneth the Admonitions of God&#146;, he wrote  (<span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span>, 1774, C3<i>r</i>). His Anglicanism also overlapped with a firm conviction of English national superiority. He thus lashed out at papists, Jews, and atheists as corrupting foreign influences, and bewailed the corruption of morals resulting from the decline in attendance at church and observation of the Sabbath.<br>
<br>Season also repeatedly denounced the vices of smoking, snuff, and gambling, and especially the availability of cheap liquor. This low opinion of people's natural probity applied equally to their intelligence. On non-compliers with the new-style calendar, for example, who felt that they were being cheated of eleven days, Season remarked contemptuously that &#145;some such Apes we have in my own Parish, who are altogether incorrigible, and whose Understanding is scarce a degree above that of a Hottentot&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span>, 1761, 2&#150;3). (His opinion of other races may also be inferred.)<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Season could not afford entirely to do without the rural poor. Indeed, in one year, in an effort to render his almanac more readily comprehensible to his semi-literate readers, he replaced the symbols of moon's signs with drawings of the corresponding parts of the body (the head for Aries, and so on). His contempt coexisted, however paradoxically, with a genuine concern for their welfare, just as his patriotism was of the progressive kind. His radical politics, evident in his constant urging of reforms to help the common people and criticizing the government for its corruption, was a dominant theme in his almanac. He was a friend of the earl of Shelburne, the radical whig leader, and of Sir Edward Holt, MP for Chippenham. He extolled Shelburne, Pitt, and especially John Wilkes for championing English liberty and justice.<br>
<br>Season died on 10 November 1775. There is a plaque on the wall of the parish church of St Nicholas, Bromham, commemorating him. Thomas Wright, in Leicestershire, took over editing the <span class="italic">Speculum Anni</span> with the issue of 1775, but failed to maintain its interest.<br>
