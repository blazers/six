<span class="headword">McCrone,  Guy Fulton</span>  (1898&#150;1977), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 13 September 1898 at 93 Westbourne Road, Birkenhead, the elder son of Robert McCrone, margarine manufacturer from Ayrshire, and his wife, Jane, daughter of Hugh Osborne, cheese merchant. The family moved to Glasgow where McCrone was educated at Glasgow Academy. He graduated in economics at Pembroke College, Cambridge, before studying singing in Vienna under Jean de Reske. He married Sylvia Louise Shanks (<i>b</i>. 1899/1900) on 30 April 1931.<br>
<br>McCrone took an active part in Glasgow musical life, being a member of the local grand opera and chamber music societies. He sang Aeneas in a Glasgow production of Berlioz's <span class="italic">Les Troyens</span> in 1935, the first British performance of the complete opera. With his cousin the playwright Osborne Henry Mavor (James Bridie) he was involved in founding Glasgow Citizens' Theatre in 1943, being at different periods business manager and managing director. McCrone had no experience in theatre management but, a colleague later wrote, &#145;Bridie had decided that Mr McCrone would somehow rise to the occasion &hellip; [He] settled nobly to his pioneer task &hellip; when he might have been writing [a best-selling novel] like his <span class="italic">Wax Fruit</span>&#146;  (Bannister, 208&#150;9).<br>
<br>McCrone's first novel, <span class="italic">The Striped Umbrellas</span>, was published in 1937. He began to write <span class="italic">Antimacassar City</span>, which later became part 1 of <span class="italic">Wax Fruit</span>, before the outbreak of the Second World War and finished it during the spare moments of his wartime job as an air-raid warden. Published in 1940, it was always planned as the first part of a trilogy about a middle-class family of provision merchants in Victorian Glasgow, but the second and third parts, <span class="italic">The Philistines</span> and <span class="italic">The Puritans</span>, were not published separately at that time. All three appeared in one volume as <span class="italic">Wax Fruit: the Story of the Moorhouse Family</span> (1947), the novel for which McCrone remains best known. Because of paper rationing the original print run was fairly small, but the novel was chosen as a book of the month in America and became a best-seller. It was later translated into French and German. By the time of McCrone's death it had sold 1 million copies.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Wax Fruit</span> was especially popular with Glasgow readers and there was a persistent belief that it was possible to identify the real-life originals of the characters. McCrone explicitly denied this in dedicating <span class="italic">Wax Fruit</span> to &#145;Glasgow readers&#146;: &#145;No. You must forgive me. But I did not have the impertinence to draw for you portraits of your grandparents and their friends&#146;. The novel and its sequels <span class="italic">Aunt Bel</span> (1949) and <span class="italic">The Hayburn Family</span> (1952), which together cover the period 1870&#150;1901, are, however, the product of considerable research into Glasgow social history. McCrone wrote: &#145;It is fleeting detail that matters to the novelist and gives him his background. In the newspapers, it is not the great things that are remembered to this day. It is such things as the advertisement columns&#146;  (McCrone). Guy McCrone retired to the Lake District with his wife in 1965 and died of heart disease at his home, Brackenmere, Birthwaite Road, Windermere, on 30 May 1977. He was survived by his wife.<br>
