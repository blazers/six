<span class="headword">Randall,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1802), <span class="occ">shipbuilder</span>, was the son of John Randall, shipbuilder, of Rotherhithe. He received a classical education. On the death of his father, about 1776, he successfully continued the shipbuilding business, applying himself at the same time to the study of mathematics and the principles of naval construction. In the course of his career, as well as building a large number of ships for the mercantile marine and the East India Company, he built over forty for the government, including several 74-gun ships and large frigates. He took a prominent part in founding the Society of Naval Architects, and collected materials for a treatise on naval architecture, which he abandoned on the publication of some French works.<br>
<br>Randall died at his house in Great Cumberland Street, Hyde Park, London, in 1802. His death occurred towards the end of a strike by shipwrights, who worked along the Thames, against a reduction of their wages from a war to a peace rate. It was alleged that he died from a fever resulting from a slight wound incurred in his attempt to quell a riot. However, the charge of wounding him was denied by a spokesman for the shipwrights, who claimed he was highly respected by his employees as more of a parent than a master. Randall was survived by his wife and children.<br>
