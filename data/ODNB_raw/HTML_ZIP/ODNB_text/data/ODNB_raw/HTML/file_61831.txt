<span class="headword">Penhaligon,  David Charles</span>  (1944&#150;1986), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 6 June 1944 at Truro Nursing Home, the eldest son of Robert Charles Penhaligon (1903&#150;1975), owner of a caravan park, and his wife, Sadie Jewell (<i>b</i>. 1913). Educated at Bosvigo primary school and Truro School, Penhaligon joined the Camborne engineering firm Holman Bros in 1962, studying towards a higher national diploma in engineering at Cornwall Technical College at the same time. As a chartered engineer he specialized in the research and development of rock-drilling equipment.<br>
<br>Although his parents were Conservatives, Penhaligon was inspired to join the Liberal Party after acting as a witness in a murder trial in 1963, in which his evidence failed to prevent both defendants from being hanged. Truro Liberal Association was then one of Cornwall's weakest, but Penhaligon's flair for organization and leadership fashioned the Young Liberals into a powerful force in the district. He swiftly assumed positions of prominence within the regional and national Young Liberal organizations, but his ambition to contest the Truro parliamentary seat in 1966 was thwarted. He was also rejected for the Falmouth and Camborne constituency in 1968, partly because of his youth but also because his thick Cornish burr was deemed unsuitable for a Westminster candidate.<br>
<br>Undaunted, Penhaligon was adopted as Liberal candidate for Totnes in 1970, finishing third in a disappointing election for the party. He was adopted, with little resistance, for Truro in 1971 and, inspired by the impact Wallace Lawler had made in Birmingham, revolutionized electioneering in the constituency. Liberal candidates were encouraged to stand in local elections for the first time as Penhaligon worked tirelessly to promote the Liberal cause, appealing in particular to the staunchly Labour clay workers in the east of the constituency. Narrowing the Conservative majority to 2561 in February 1974, he bucked the national trend to win by 464 votes eight months later.<br>
<br>Penhaligon had married Annette Lidgey (<i>b</i>. 1946), a fellow Young Liberal, on 6 January 1968 and at the time of his election they ran the post office at Chacewater. They had a son and a daughter. His immediate impact in the House of Commons was as a champion of Cornish interests, often working across party lines with fellow MPs for the county. He cultivated the image of a political outsider, deploying humour and common sense to confound his opponents and to appeal to people, Liberal or otherwise, both within his constituency and beyond. He increased his majority substantially in the elections of 1979 and 1983.<br>
<br>Initially speaking for the Liberal Party on employment matters, Penhaligon was later spokesman for energy and industry, before becoming the party's Treasury spokesman in 1985. Throughout his political career he championed industrial profit-sharing schemes and worker participation in the management of companies. Decentralization of power was another consistent theme, and Penhaligon argued against the establishment of bodies representing the south-west of England but based in distant Bristol. He was a critic of the civil uses of nuclear power, but at the 1980 Liberal assembly told delegates that proponents of a non-nuclear defence policy were &#145;advocating surrender&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 Dec 86). No financial expert, he initially struggled with the high-profile Treasury brief, with which he was becoming more comfortable at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Behind his affable charm Penhaligon was a sharp political operator. Although not an enthusiastic supporter of the Lib&#150;Lab pact, he worked well with Bill Rodgers on environmental matters, but less well with Tony Benn on energy. His speech to the special Liberal assembly of January 1978 made a significant contribution to the continuation of the pact. He played a key role in the allocation of constituencies to be fought by Liberal and Social Democrat candidates, before both 1983 and 1987 general elections, again working in tandem with Rodgers. He headed the Liberal by-election unit from 1983 to 1985.<br>
<br>A favourite of Liberal activists, he was the only sitting MP ever to be elected president of the party, in 1985. Above all, however, he was a politician who related to the lives of ordinary people, as was shown by the reaction to his death in a car crash at Truck Fork, near Probus, on the road between Truro and St Austell, on 22 December 1986. Thousands of people thronged the streets of Truro for a service of thanksgiving for his life at the city's cathedral on 10 January 1987 and supported a memorial fund set up in his name. David Steel described Penhaligon as &#145;an instinctive Liberal of the old school&#146;  (Penhaligon, 122) and his contribution to Liberalism was sorely missed in the years of turbulence which affected the Liberal Party and its successor in the years after his death. Penhaligon was buried on 30 December 1986 at All Hallows Church, St Kea, Truro, and was survived by his wife.<br>
