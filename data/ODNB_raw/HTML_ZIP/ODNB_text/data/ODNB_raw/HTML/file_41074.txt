<span class="headword">Brock family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1895&#150;1960), <span class="occ">illustrators and painters</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_41074"></a><span class="headword">Charles Edmund Brock</span>  (1870&#150;1938)<span class="occ"></span>. Born in London on 5 February 1870, the son of Edmund Brock (1841&#150;1921), a scholar in medieval and oriental languages and a reader at the Cambridge University Press, and his wife, Mary Ann Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pegram (1836&#150;1914), he was the eldest of a large family of which two other sons were also to make their living from their art. <a name="cosubject_69386"></a><span class="headword">Richard Henry Brock</span>  (<em>b. </em>early 1870s), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was also born in London, before the family moved to Cambridge where Thomas Alfred Brock, mathematician, was born, followed by <a name="cosubject_69385"></a><span class="headword">Henry Matthew Brock</span>  (1875&#150;1960)<span class="occ"></span> on 11 July 1875.<br>
<br>H. M. Brock, as he was to sign his work, described himself as an illustrator and watercolour artist. From 1895 until the outbreak of the First World War, Charles and Harry, as he was known to the family, were in the front rank of British book and magazine illustrators, with Charles also becoming established as a portrait painter. In order to avoid confusion with the unrelated homonymous portrait painter who was the son of the sculptor Sir Thomas Brock, Charles dropped his second forename in signing his work. His initial training was largely in the studio of the Cambridge sculptor Henry Wiles. Charles Brock came to public notice as an illustrator in the &#145;black and white&#146; school led by Hugh Thomson with 130 pen drawings for Thomas Hood's <span class="italic">Humorous Poems</span>, published in Macmillan's attractive <span class="roman">Cranford</span> series in 1893. His wash drawings for the Tyneside publisher Walter Scott, who brought out <span class="italic">The Humour of Germany</span> and <span class="italic">The Humour of America</span> in that year, made less impact. In 1894 Macmillan printed a further 100 of Charles's pen drawings in an edition of Swift's <span class="italic">Gulliver's Travels</span>, also in the <span class="roman">Cranford</span> series. In the following year Macmillan published Galt's <span class="italic">Annals of the Parish</span> and Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span>, both in its <span class="roman">Illustrated Standard Novels</span> series. By this time, Charles was in great demand and was working for other publishers, including Service and Paton, who published his illustrations to Scott's <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1897) and Goldsmith's <span class="italic">Vicar of Wakefield</span> (1898). A high point of his work for Macmillan came in 1896 with a two-volume edition of Charles Kingsley's <span class="italic">Westward Ho!</span>.<br>
<br>The same publisher also brought H. M. Brock to prominence with Captain Marryat's stories, <span class="italic">Jacob Faithful</span> and <span class="italic">Japhet in Search of a Father</span>, both issued in the <span class="roman">Illustrated Standard Novels</span> series in 1895. In the following year Harry produced over 100 pen drawings for Cassell's edition of W. M. Thackeray's <span class="italic">Ballads and Songs</span> and in 1898 illustrated Elizabeth Gaskell's <span class="italic">Cranford</span> for Service and Paton. Later reprints of this title carried colour plates from his watercolours. In 1898 he illustrated <span class="italic">Scenes of Child Life</span>, by Lady Frazer. This was the first of a number of school texts in French to be illustrated by H. M. Brock, Siepmann's <span class="italic">Primary French Course</span> following in 1902 and H. F. Collins's <span class="italic">French Course for Schools</span> in 1929&#150;30, all published by Macmillan. Harry's pen drawings, which were much more forceful than those of his brother, gave a convincing, if imaginary, picture of French life. In 1928, when the opportunity to illustrate standard novels was almost non-existent, Harry painted thirty-two watercolours for G. Bell &amp; Sons' <span class="italic">New French Picture Cards</span>, published to accompany textbooks by Marc Ceppi. Before the end of the First World War, the brothers contributed to <span class="italic">Punch</span>, and over seventy articles and stories in the <span class="italic">Strand Magazine</span> carried their illustrations.<br>
<br>Both Harry and Charles Brock benefited greatly from their introduction to the fledgeling London publisher J. M. Dent, for whom they jointly provided watercolour drawings for a set of Jane Austen's novels in 1898. Both were attracted to the architecture, furniture, and costume of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and set about gathering period artefacts for their studio, which they shared with Richard, although his interests did not lie in period illustration. Notable examples of Charles's work are the watercolours he provided for Dent's <span class="roman">English Idylls</span> series (1904&#150;9) and <span class="roman">English Essayists</span> series, where his pen drawings are to be found in two volumes of Lamb's <span class="italic">Essays of Elia</span>. Harry's major contribution to this series was in the three-volume <span class="italic">Breakfast Table</span> essays of Oliver Wendell Holmes of 1902, which led to a series of well-known posters for Chivers, the Cambridgeshire jam manufacturers. He also provided the drawings for <span class="italic">Essays of Leigh Hunt</span> and <span class="italic">Essays of Douglas Jerrold</span> (both 1903), and <span class="italic">Sir Roger de Coverley and other Papers from The Spectator</span> (1905). The strength of Harry's drawing is particularly obvious in W. E. Mallett's <span class="italic">Introduction to Old English Furniture</span>, issued by Newnes in 1906.<br>
<br>Because of their versatility and willingness to take on such a wide variety of work, it is believed that the Brocks did not command the respect publishers accorded Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac, who were much less prolific. As a result, they did not have the opportunity to work on the lavish picture books issued by such publishers as Heinemann and Hodder and Stoughton between the turn of the century and 1914. Charles's best opportunity was to contribute coloured illustrations for Sampson Low's boxed, limited issues of Blackmore's <span class="italic">Lorna Doone</span> (1910) and three of Jeffrey Farnol's popular historical novels. Harry's finest colour work came in the large-format books of fairy tales published in 1913 and 1914 by Frederick Warne. Unlike his brothers, Richard Brock illustrated few standard novels. His work was published in such annuals as <span class="italic">The Prize</span> and <span class="italic">Chatterbox</span> and, in general, restricted to the illustration of children's stories, where his drawings appear weak when compared with those of Harry, who illustrated the popular school stories of Desmond Coke.<br>
<br>Much of the Brock brothers' later income came from uninspiring periodicals, children's annuals and the cheap &#145;budget&#146; books sold in chain stores. Charles was also in demand in Cambridge as a portrait painter specializing in college and local dignitaries, and Richard apparently made a modest income from paintings, mainly in oils, of the local landscape. Both Charles and Harry were interested in the theatre: with Russell Flint, Charles illustrated <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">The Yeomen of the Guard</span> (1929), while Harry produced posters for the D'Oyly Carte Company and large coloured illustrations which appeared in the Christmas numbers of <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, <span class="italic">Holly Leaves</span>, and <span class="italic">The Sphere</span>. He also provided a large number of attractive watercolour drawings of Gilbert and Sullivan characters for cigarette cards issued by John Player &amp; Sons in 1925 and 1926.<br>
<br>The depressed years of the 1930s severely curtailed the market for illustration. Richard illustrated girls' stories for Blackie &amp; Sons while Charles provided watercolours for Harrap's handsome editions of Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span>, <span class="italic">Christmas Tales</span>, <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span>, and <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> (1930&#150;32). His best work of this period is in Annie and Eliza Keary's <span class="italic">The Heroes of Asgard</span> (1930) and Mrs Molesworth's <span class="italic">The Cuckoo Clock</span> (1931), both published by Macmillan. Charles provided spirited colour work for the book jackets of Jeffrey Farnol's novels, a task subsequently taken over by Harry after 1938. All three brothers exhibited at the Royal Academy and also at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, Harry being elected to the Royal Institute in 1906 and Charles in 1908. Charles, who had married Annie Dudley Smith, died in Cambridge on 28 February 1938. The couple had no children. Harry Brock died in Cambridge on 21 July 1960, survived by his widow, the former Doris Joan Pegram, and his children Margaret, Joan, and Bevis. It is not known where or when Richard died.<br>
