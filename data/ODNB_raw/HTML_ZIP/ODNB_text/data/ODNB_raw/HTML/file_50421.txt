<span class="headword">Stead,  Patrick</span>  (1788&#150;1869), <span class="occ">maltster</span>, was born at Stead's Place, Leith Walk, Edinburgh, the son and probably the only child of David Stead, merchant and card manufacturer. Stead was educated at Perth Academy and afterwards trained with a London grain merchant. His work involved supplying barley to the brewers, Truman, Hanbury, and Buxton, thus beginning a relationship which was to have a decisive influence on his future. He began his career as a corn merchant and factor at Great Yarmouth, initially working with two Scottish partners, Thomas MacKenzie and John Robinson; but Stead continued the business after 1832 as sole proprietor. The partners soon began malting; by the 1820s they were renting maltings scattered throughout Norfolk and Suffolk, and exporting substantial quantities of malt and barley to London, Liverpool, and Hull. Stead quickly acquired a fine reputation as a maltster, giving evidence to the select committee on the sale of corn in 1834 and in the same year representing the region's maltsters at the excise enquiry on malt. Twelve years later he told the select committee on railway bills that he believed he was almost the largest maltster in the country.<br>
<br>For thirty years Stead supplied malt to Trumans, becoming their foremost East Anglian maltster. His expertise was also recognized by the great brewer, Michael Bass, who considered him to be the best maltster in England, and in 1842 paid for him to visit Munich to study German malting methods. Four years earlier Stead had moved his headquarters from Yarmouth to Halesworth, Suffolk, where he built a large complex of seven new maltings. Here he developed a revolutionary malting system using steam and hot air to control germination and kilning. Patented in 1842, and described in White's 1844 <span class="italic">Directory of Suffolk</span>, it was in many respects the prototype of modern-day mechanical malting. Although the equipment subsequently failed, for four years Stead supplied large amounts of steam malt to Trumans. Not until the 1870s was pneumatic malting successfully developed on a commercial scale, an indication, in a highly conservative industry, of Stead's originality.<br>
<br>Patrick Stead was a thrusting, self-confident Scot. A whig and devout disciple of Bentham, he tackled with great enthusiasm any constraints to the progress of his business. The Yarmouth historian, C. J. Palmer, noted in particular his active promotion of &#145;mercantile improvements&#146;  (Palmer, 275). His efforts to modernize the neglected harbours and navigations upon which his trade depended were frustrated by those whose interests and philosophy opposed his own. At Halesworth, he resolved the problem when in 1826 he became a commissioner of the River Blyth Navigation. But at Southwold, where his ships were frequently confined, he faced the full force of the landed interest, which, under the chair of the earl of Stradbroke, dominated the harbour commission. For years Stead fought for the merchants and shipowners to be fairly represented. Twice he took his case to Westminster: in 1830, when a new harbour bill was passed, and in 1845, when the tidal harbour commission reported on Southwold. On both occasions, despite the support of his close friend, the radical reformer, Joseph Hume, he was defeated. Sensing a new era of competition, Stead was among the first directors of the East Suffolk Railway Company. Finally, in 1849 he agreed to sell his business to Trumans for &pound;18,000.<br>
<br>Stead married a Scot, Susan (1796&#150;1875), the eldest daughter of Fulton Alexander. There were no children, and when in 1851 Stead retired, the couple returned to Scotland and settled at Lansdown Park, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, where they had family connections. Stead retained a deep affection for Halesworth; he had served as an overseer and regularly attended vestry and parish meetings, and in his will left more than &pound;25,000 in trust to build and endow the Patrick Stead Hospital. Stead died suddenly on 28 June 1869 at Birnam, Dunkeld, while on a visit undertaken to restore his failing health. He was buried at the parish church of Helensburgh, where he had worshipped, and was survived by his wife. He left an estate valued at &pound;55,826.<br>
