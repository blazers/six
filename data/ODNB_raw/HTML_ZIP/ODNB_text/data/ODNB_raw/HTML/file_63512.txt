<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hastings,  Marian</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Anna Maria Apollonia Chapuset; <em>other married name </em>Marian  von Imhoff, Baroness von Imhoff]</span>  (1747&#150;1837), <span class="occ">wife of Warren Hastings</span>, was, on the evidence of the act granting her British nationality in 1796, born in Nuremberg. No date is stated, but a secondary source indicates 2 February 1747. Her grandfather was Charles Chapuset de St Valentin, protestant officer in the household troops of the king of France, who was obliged to go into exile following the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. He went to Berlin as a teacher of languages and of dancing but finally settled at Altdorf, near Nuremberg, where, as a widower, he married Katharina Maria M&uuml;ller, a clergyman's daughter, in 1693. They had two sons. Another son was born from a third marriage. This last son, Johann Jakob, married Caroline Friederike Grundgeiger or Krongeiger (<i>b</i>. 1720) at Karlsruhe. He is said to have died in 1758, leaving a widow and two children, Anna Maria Apollonia, the future Mrs Hastings, and Johann Paul Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1749).<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Anna Maria Chapuset's childhood and adolescence, and the place and date of her marriage to Baron Christoph Carl Adam von Imhoff (<i>c</i>.1734&#150;<i>c</i>.1802) are uncertain. Nuremberg, Stuttgart, and Strelitz have all been advanced as hypothetical venues and the years from 1765 to 1768 as likely dates. Imhoff was an officer in the W&uuml;rttemberg army left unemployed by the end of the Seven Years' War. Some sources maintain that he met his future wife in Nuremberg; others argue for Strelitz, where she was said to be a maid of honour at the court of the duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Imhoffs and their two sons, Charles and Julius, moved to England in 1768 through the good offices of Elizabeth Schwellenberg, Queen Charlotte's mistress of the robes. Imhoff soon obtained a cadetship in the East India Company's Madras army but, as an accomplished miniature portraitist, he no doubt also saw a market for his artistic skills in India. Early in 1769, accompanied by his wife and elder child, he embarked for Madras in the <i>Duke of Grafton</i>. Among the passengers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12587/', "Warren Hastings (1732&#150;1818)")</script>, then a widower of thirty-seven, returning to India. The baroness took Hastings under her care when he fell ill and a shipboard romance blossomed. Imhoff lived in Madras with his wife until the latter part of 1770, when, having resigned his army commission, he moved to Calcutta in search of a wider clientele for his portraits. His wife remained in Madras, for part of the time at least, a resident in Hastings's house. She joined her husband in Calcutta in October 1771. Hastings followed in February 1772 on taking up his new appointment as governor of Bengal. In a company general letter to Madras dated 25 March 1772 Imhoff was ordered to return to Europe for declining military service. He arrived back in September 1773 and, presumably, started divorce proceedings.<br>
<br>Many questions remain unanswered regarding the course of events that led up to the marriage of Warren Hastings and the former Baroness von Imhoff in Calcutta on 8 August 1777. It is supposed that she lived in Hastings's house at Alipore or one nearby. Suggestions by Macaulay and Wraxall that Hastings simply paid Imhoff a large sum of money to divorce his wife oversimplify more sophisticated transactions. Hastings undertook to adopt the Imhoffs' two boys and almost certainly made funds available for legal and other expenses which probably erred on the side of generosity. However Hastings and the baroness may have lived before their marriage, discretion prevailed. Philip Francis, Hastings's severest political foe, mocked the liaison but never seriously traduced it. In fact he wrote of Marian Hastings as &#145;accomplished&#146; and deserving of &#145;every mark of respect&#146;  (Parkes and Merivale, 2.96). Relations between Imhoff, his former wife, and Hastings remained amicable during and after the divorce proceedings.<br>
<br>A decree of divorce, dated Weimar, 1 June 1776, was granted by the duke of Saxony on Imhoff's petition that he considered himself &#145;an abandoned conjugal mate&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 39903, fol. 65). It did not reach Calcutta until July 1777, where its validity was confirmed by an English missionary. The baroness reverted to her maiden name, and a marriage licence was issued on 5 August 1777 in which she was described as a &#145;singlewoman&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 39904<span class="smallcap">A</span>). The wedding took place three days later. The marriage brought enduring happiness to both parties, but also regrets that there were no children. Marian Hastings, as she became known, sailed to England for her health in 1784. Hastings left India in 1785, and they eventually settled at Daylesford in Worcestershire, where Hastings built a new house on his ancestral estate. Marian continued to live there after her husband's death in 1818.<br>
<br>Hastings took his wife into his confidence over political affairs, but Wraxall exaggerated when he wrote that Marian &#145;invariably maintained her ascendancy over his [Hastings's] mind as well as his affections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical and Posthumous Memoirs</span>, 4.17&#150;18). Certainly Hastings indulged her and she had influence, but ultimately he kept his mind his own. In their personal financial affairs Marian's prudence contrasted with Hastings's extravagance. In a statement to the East India Company in 1795 Hastings declared his wife's fortune to be &pound;40,000, her marriage settlement accounting for the greater part of the total. However, it has since been estimated that &#145;at the time she actually possessed at least &pound;107,725&#146;  (Marshall, 252). Marian's financial affairs in India remain an enigma and she appears to have concealed her wealth from her husband. She palpably suffered a substantial loss in 1797 when one of her bankers stopped payments.<br>
<br>Marian's jewel-bedecked figure dazzled society in London and Calcutta. It was a gift to caricaturists and satirists, and a general source of amusement or concern. &#145;Our weather remains unparagoned&#146;, wrote Horace Walpole. &#145;Mrs. Hastings is not more brilliant&#146;  (Walpole to Mary Berry, 7 Nov 1793, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 12.55). Fanny Burney complained that she made everyone else look underdressed and thought that &#145;a modest &amp; quiet appearance &amp; demeanour&#146; would be more becoming during Hastings's trial  (<span class="italic">The Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney (Madame D'Arblay)</span>, ed. J. Hemlow, 1, 1972, 25 May 1792, 165&#150;6). In spite of this, Burney thought well of Marian Hastings. She was indeed an agreeable and handsome woman with especially beautiful hair, which she wore loose and unpowdered. Her imperfect command of English, in speech and in writing, perhaps added to her distinctly exotic air. She died at Daylesford House on 29 March 1837 and was buried in the churchyard close to her husband on 7 April 1837.<br>
