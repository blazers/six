<span class="headword">Power,  Marguerite Agnes</span>  (1815?&#150;1867), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was a daughter of Colonel Robert Power (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1792), and his wife, Agnes Brooke, and niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2640/', "Marguerite Gardiner, countess of Blessington (1789&#150;1849)")</script>. Little is known about her childhood, which was probably spent in Ireland. Her mother was the daughter of Thomas Brooke, first member of council at St Helena. Her father had an army career, and afterwards became agent for the Blessington estates in co. Tyrone. He was later given a posting in Canada by Lord Durham. In 1839 Marguerite Power and her sister Ellen moved to London to live permanently with Lady Blessington at Gore House. As a result of her aunt's extensive literary connections, Marguerite Power became a friend of many of the most influential people of the day, including Walter Savage Landor, Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, Prince Louis Napoleon, and Benjamin Disraeli. During the 1840s she was a regular contributor to the annuals, particularly <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> and Heath's <span class="italic">Book of Beauty</span>. After the breakup at Gore House in April 1849, Marguerite Power and her sister accompanied their aunt to Paris. Marguerite Power wrote a memoir of Lady Blessington, prefixed to Lady Blessington's novel <span class="italic">Country Quarters</span> (1850) and reprinted in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron with the Countess of Blessington</span> (1893).<br>
<br>After Lady Blessington's death in June 1849, Marguerite Power remained in Paris, supporting herself as a journalist and novelist. From 1851 to 1857 she edited <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span>, to which Dickens contributed &#145;To be Read at Dusk&#146; in 1852. The annual's folding came as a great financial blow and, despite an extensive literary output, she struggled financially for the rest of her life. She continued to write for periodicals and annuals, including four stories and a poem for <span class="italic">Household Words</span>, and miscellaneous pieces for <span class="italic">Once a Week</span>, the <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span>, the <span class="italic">Irish Metropolitan Magazine</span>, and <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span>. In 1853, at Thackeray's recommendation, she was given the job as Paris correspondent for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. According to Charles Mackay, this was something of a sympathy posting, but he noted that she distinguished herself well in the position, becoming the first journalist to announce the engagement of Louis Napoleon  (Mackay, 2.296).<br>
<br>Marguerite Power published her first novel, <span class="italic">Evelyn Forester</span>, in 1856; it was favourably compared to the works of Lady Blessington. This was followed by <span class="italic">The Foresters</span> (1858), the pseudonymous <span class="italic">Letters of a Betrothed</span> (1858, signed Honoria), <span class="italic">Nelly Carew</span> (1859), and <span class="italic">Sweethearts and Wives</span> (1861).<br>
<br>In 1857 Dickens, Thackeray, and John Forster raised a subscription of &pound;200 for her from among the old friends of Lady Blessington  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 8.497). Later, Dickens helped secure a publisher for her final book. In 1860 she published a poem, &#145;Virginia's Hand&#146;, dedicated to John Forster. It was evidently written under the influence of Mrs Browning's <span class="italic">Aurora Leigh</span>. Landor highly praised her poetical efforts, especially a poem written by her in Heath's <span class="italic">Book of Beauty</span>. Her last publication was an account of a winter's residence in Egypt, entitled <span class="italic">Arabian Days and Nights, or, Rays from the East</span> (1863). It is dedicated to Janet and Henry Ross, with whom she stayed at Alexandria. A fall from a horse caused a severe spinal injury from which she never fully recovered. She died at Bushey Heath, Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 1 July 1867 after a long battle with cancer.<br>
<br>In its obituary notice, the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> faults Marguerite Power's writing for a lack of &#145;literary individuality or merit&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 266). However, by the accounts of her contemporaries and friends, she was respected as a writer and editor. Camilla Toulmin Crosland defends her against the charge that she was responsible for the folding of <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span>  (C. T. Crosland, 121), and Dickens published her contributions in his periodicals. It was no doubt her extended financial hardships that gave her a &#145;pensive and taciturn&#146; quality noticed by her friends  (N. Crosland, 181). She lacked &#145;hopeful eagerness&#146; and &#145;buoyancy of youth&#146;, and was &#145;calm, earnest, and dignified, even in her girlhood&#146;  (C. T. Crosland, 100). She was praised by all her friends especially for her intelligence, sense of humour, warmth, tact, and unfailing generosity.<br>
