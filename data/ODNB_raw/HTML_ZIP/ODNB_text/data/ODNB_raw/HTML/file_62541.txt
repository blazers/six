<span class="headword">Scott,  Jonathan</span>  (1735&#150;1807), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 15 November 1735 at Shrewsbury, the second son of Captain Richard Scott of Scott's Hall in Kent and Mary, the daughter and heir of Jonathan Scott of Belton Grange, near Shrewsbury. After &#145;a polite education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>, 15.489), he became a cornet at the age of seventeen and subsequently a captain-lieutenant in His Majesty's 7th regiment of dragoons, in which he served for seventeen years including several campaigns in Europe. Intermittently religious from a young age, he was converted by the preaching at a Sussex country house of the leading London evangelical William Romaine, a close associate of the Calvinist Methodist leader Selina, countess of Huntingdon. Thereafter Scott began to preach, first to his own soldiers: in a letter to the religious controversialist Sir Richard Hill, he refers to &#145;the Lord extending his mercy and his grace&#146; as he congregated his men twice daily in his lodgings from 1766 for prayer and <span class="roman">Bible</span> study. A year later, starting in Leicester, he began preaching wherever his regiment was posted, indoors or out, sometimes with violent opposition, so that he acquired the reputation of being &#145;an arrant methodist&#146;. His correspondence reveals friendship with many evangelical leaders, especially Hill, John Fletcher of Madeley, John Newton, and Henry Venn  (Macfadyen, 51&#150;4).<br>
<br>In 1769, a year after his marriage on 1 June 1768 to Elizabeth Cley (<i>d</i>. 1799), a pious heiress of Wollerton in Shropshire, Scott was faced with an ultimatum from his superior officers to choose between his preaching and his military career. As a result he resigned his commission, though he continued to appear in the pulpit in uniform, and was widely known as Captain Scott. More than any other minister, Scott was responsible for the establishment of evangelical congregationalism in Staffordshire; some twenty-two churches trace their origins to his labours, not to mention five churches in Shropshire, six in Cheshire, four or five in Lancashire, and others in Derbyshire which were profoundly influenced or started by him. At Middlewich in Cheshire and Leek in Staffordshire congregations which had adopted Unitarianism were restored through his efforts to evangelical orthodoxy. Pressed to become pastor of the congregation at Lancaster, a position he would have found too restricting, he did consent to be ordained there in September 1776 as &#145;presbyter at large&#146;  (Urwick, 137).<br>
<br>From about 1776 Scott concentrated his work in the under-provided county of Staffordshire. Beginning in Newcastle under Lyme, where the baptismal registers of the chapel he founded date to 1777, he seven years later purchased land called the Marsh on which a new chapel was erected. The work was soon extended to the potteries where he preached in what he called &#145;his old cathedral&#146;, namely the streets. The &#145;Tabernacle&#146; in Hanley, the fruit of his labours there, was opened in 1784 in self-conscious resemblance to George Whitefield's chapel in London, where Scott preached frequently for twenty years. Other Staffordshire towns which benefited from Scott's ministry include Lichfield, Stone, Uttoxeter, and Stafford. However, the military parson was not always well received; his preaching in Gnosall in mid-Staffordshire in 1778, with George Burder, provoked a &#145;formidable riot&#146;. John Wesley, it appears, was also unhappy with some of Scott's activities. Recording the minister's presence at a sermon preached in Newcastle under Lyme in March 1781, Wesley&#151;apparently laying some kind of proprietorial claim to missionary activity in north Staffordshire&#151;wrote of how Scott and his preachers &#145;have lately begun to preach both here and at Burslem. If they would go and break up fresh ground we should rejoice, but we cannot commend them for breaking in upon our labours after we have borne the burden and the heat of the day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals</span>, 6.309). Scott, as part of the Calvinistic evangelical revival, was unprepared to leave the field to the Arminians, whose record historically he found unsatisfactory.<br>
<br>During the 1780s Scott entered into a partnership with the evangelical activist Willielma, Viscountess Glenorchy, who financed the training of suitable young men through the Oswestry and Newcastle under Lyme academy. In addition Lady Glenorchy provided funds for underpaid ministers and for the building of new churches, with Scott acting as her secretary, treasurer, and committee, exercising an authority which has been called &#145;more than episcopal&#146;. On her death in July 1786 Glenorchy left a chapel and house at Matlock to Scott; this became his home and headquarters from 1794, though he preached on alternate Sundays at Matlock and Nantwich. Following the death of his first wife on 31 December 1799 he married in 1802 the widow of a Samuel Barrow of Nantwich. Scott himself died at Nantwich on 28 May 1807 and was buried at Queen Street Chapel, Chester, on 9 June. Commemorations of his life were generous towards a man who, while promoting religious diversity, had proved a loyal subject, marrying &#145;genuine patriotism with conscientious dissent from the established church&#146;. Such commitment was also readily apparent to congregants appreciative of a minister who, if not blessed with special intellectual gifts, &#145;was an honest, resolute, autocratic man, with a considerable allowance of practical shrewdness, a warm heart and a complete devotion to the cause which he had espoused&#146;  (<span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>, 15.546&#150;7).<br>
