<span class="headword">Vivian,  Henry Hussey</span>, first Baron Swansea  (1821&#150;1894), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 6 July 1821 at Singleton, Swansea, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47482/', "John Henry Vivian (1785&#150;1855)")</script>, industrialist and politician, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1885). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28341/', "Richard Hussey Vivian, first Baron Vivian")</script>, was his uncle. He was educated at Eton College from about 1832 until 1840, and in 1838 went to Germany and France to study languages and metallurgy. When in France, Vivian shared lodgings for a time with Friedrich Engels. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1840. In 1842 he entered the family business as a partner, taking charge of the Liverpool office of Vivian &amp; Sons, which dealt with the export trade. In 1845 he was appointed manager of the Hafod smelting works in Swansea, of which he took full control following the death of his father in 1855. Under his influence Swansea became &#145;the metallurgical centre of the world&#146;.<br>
<br>Vivian married three times. His first marriage, on 15 April 1847, was to Jessie Dalrymple, daughter of Ambrose Goddard, MP for Swindon. She died on 28 February 1848, shortly after the birth of their son, Ernest Ambrose. His second marriage, on 14 July 1853, was to Caroline Elizabeth (Flora), daughter of Sir Montague John Cholmely MP, and granddaughter of the duke of St Albans. She became crippled by illness after giving birth to their son, John Aubrey, and died on 25 January 1868. He married his third wife, Averil Beaumont (<i>c</i>.1840&#150;<i>c</i>.1935), on 10 November 1870. She was twenty years his junior and the daughter of Captain Richard Beaumont and granddaughter of Godfrey, third Lord Macdonald. They had two sons, Henry Hussey and Odo Richard, and four daughters, Violet Averil, Averil, Alberta, and Alexandra.<br>
<br>As a businessman Vivian was an innovator, taking out several patents for improved metallurgical processes, and was largely responsible for the continued expansion of Vivian &amp; Sons and the diversification of their interests. He was involved with introducing the manufacture of zinc in the 1840s. The firm began to extract gold from auriferous copper ores using Plattner's process in 1850 and silver from argentiferous copper ores in 1856. This same year they also began smelting nickel and cobalt. In 1883 a separate company, H. H. Vivian &amp; Co., was established for nickel and cobalt smelting. In 1864 Vivian &amp; Sons introduced Gerstenh&ouml;fer furnaces, which facilitated the recovery of sulphur for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, which was used by the firm to manufacture chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This innovation also received favourable publicity because of the reduced emission of the polluting &#145;copper smoke&#146;. In 1871 the firm erected works at White Rock, near Swansea, to treat poor silver-lead ores. The business became a limited liability company on 12 February 1883 under the style H. H. Vivian &amp; Co. with Vivian as its chairman. Vivian also played an active role in the Second Copper Trade Association, a secret cartel of copper smelters which operated from 1844 until 1867.<br>
<br>A man of remarkable energy and business capacity, Vivian's activities extended beyond metallurgy. As a coal owner he was involved in negotiating a settlement of the 1875 miners' strike, by which the sliding scale of linking wages to price fluctuations was introduced into the south Wales mining industry. He was also one of the chief promoters of the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, which linked the coal mines of the Rhondda valley to the port of Swansea.<br>
<br>Vivian was elected Liberal MP for Truro in 1852, joining his father in the House of Commons. Following the death of his father, he was elected MP for Glamorgan in 1857 and for the Swansea District in 1885. In parliament he served on the exchequer loan commission in 1861, the channel tunnel committee in 1882&#150;3, the committee to establish an imperial institute, and the royal commission on tithe redemption. Although a supporter of Gladstone, Vivian openly disagreed with his leader over aspects of the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>, which apparently prevented him from accepting the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster in 1886. He also consistently voted in favour of disestablishment in Wales while a staunch member of the Church of England. Throughout his long parliamentary career he was a frequent speaker in the Commons. Locally, Vivian was a trustee of the Swansea Harbour Board, and was elected the first chairman of the newly formed Glamorgan county council in 1889.<br>
<br>Like his father, Vivian maintained a strong interest in education, and together they were responsible for Vivian &amp; Sons opening a school in Sketty. He became the first treasurer of the newly founded University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in 1884, and was later its vice president, and he was involved in the founding of a technical school in Swansea, which opened after his death in 1895. He was a fellow of the Geological Society, twice president of the Royal Institution of South Wales, and president of the Cambrian Archaeological Association from 1861 to 1862.<br>
<br>In later life Vivian devoted less time to the business and more to leisure interests. He frequently visited his house in Scotland for shooting holidays, and sailed on his yacht. He also farmed at Parc le Breos in the Gower, and was well-known locally as a stock-breeder. Vivian's lack of involvement may have contributed to the decline of the family business, and especially the firm's failure in a mining venture in Sudbury, Canada, though towards the end of the century British non-ferrous metal manufacturers faced increasing international competition.<br>
<br>Vivian was created a baronet on 13 May 1882 on the recommendation of Gladstone in recognition of his long public service, and elevated to the peerage, also by Gladstone, as Baron Swansea on 9 June 1893. He was made a freeman of Swansea in the same year. Vivian died suddenly of heart failure at Singleton on 28 November 1894 shortly after returning from America; he was buried in Sketty churchyard, near Swansea, on 3 December. He was survived by his wife.<br>
