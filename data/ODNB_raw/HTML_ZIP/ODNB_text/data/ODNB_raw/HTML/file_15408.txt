<span class="headword">Kennion,  Edward</span>  (1744&#150;1809), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 15 January 1744 in Liverpool, the son of James Kennion, a businessman. His grandfather, John Kennion, was a nonconformist minister preaching at the Toxteth Park Chapel, Liverpool. A relative, John Kennion, took charge of Edward's education, placing him at John Holt's school in Liverpool. When Kennion was fifteen he entered Mr Fuller's academy in London, where he learned to draw. Edward Kennion sailed for Jamaica in 1762, and joined the British attack on Spanish Havana under Sir George Pococke and George Keppel, third earl of Albemarle, in which John Kennion was commissary. After the capture of Havana Kennion went briefly to New York to recover his health, and then returned to England in December 1763. In 1765 he again went to Jamaica, where he remained until July 1769, serving as superintendent of John Kennion's estates and aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief of the island.<br>
<br>In 1769 Kennion returned to London, where he worked in trade until 1782. About 1771 Kennion made the acquaintance of George Barret RA, a landscape painter, and in the following years accompanied him on sketching tours in the Lake District and around Liverpool. On 13 November 1774 Kennion married Ann Bengough, a Worcester woman of some property. None of the couple's several children survived, and Kennion's wife died in 1786. On 10 October 1787 he married Mary Hill of Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire. In 1782, Kennion had retired from business in London and moved to Rydd-Green, near Malvern in Worcestershire. There he began making drawings for a treatise on landscape painting. In 1784 he published <span class="italic">Antiquities of the Counties of Hereford and Monmouth</span> which contained five perspective views of ancient castles on the Welsh border, and three ground plans engraved by R. Godfrey, with full descriptions by Kennion. Kennion spent the winters of 1787 and 1788 in London, where he gave drawing lessons. In 1789 Kennion and his family moved to London permanently, and he adopted the profession of teacher and artist.<br>
<br>Kennion was admitted as a fellow to the Society of Artists in 1790. Between 1790 and 1791 he exhibited twenty-four works, including drawings, watercolours, and oil sketches, at its annual exhibitions. He also exhibited eight pictures at the Royal Academy between 1795 and 1807. Several of the works shown at the Society of Artists were designated as studies for a proposed work entitled <span class="italic">Elements of Landscape and Picturesque Beauty</span>, to be published in four volumes. Kennion's uncle, a Liverpool physician, died in 1791, leaving him enough money to proceed with plans for the book. In 1803 Kennion published a full prospectus of the work, and final arrangements were made for the publication of the first volume early in 1809. However, before the volume was published Kennion died in London on 14 April 1809. He was survived by his wife and four children, including his son <a href="#cosubject_15408">Charles John Kennion [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who was born in 1789.<br>
<br>The only part of Kennion's proposed <span class="italic">Elements of Landscape and Picturesque Beauty</span> that was complete at his death was entitled <span class="italic">An Essay on Trees in Landscape</span> and was issued in 1815. Many of the plates for this work were engraved or finished in aquatint and soft ground etching by his son Charles. The volume contains fifty etched and aquatinted plates, a preface and biographical notice, and forty-eight pages of instructional text. A copy in the Manchester Free Library was bound up in 1844 with four large unpublished landscapes said to be by Kennion, and six picturesque studies of trees, etched by H. W. Williams. A critic, Arlunydd Penygarn, wrote: &#145;He seems to have devoted himself to the representation of the specific growth of trees, and gives studies of a great number, sometimes very good, sometimes not so happy, but it was a thing needed in the art of the time&#146;  (Dibdin, 88). Characteristic examples of Kennion's work such as <span class="italic">Landscape with Fishermen</span> (V&amp;A) show picturesque landscapes populated by figures and animals, and surrounded by soft masses of foliage-laden trees. An engraving by Kennion, after a drawing by Benjamin Ferrey, was included in Ferrey's book <span class="italic">The Antiquities of the Priory of Christ-Church, Hampshire</span> (1834). According to the preface of <span class="italic">An Essay on Trees in Landscape</span>, Kennion seldom painted in oils, and his earlier work was executed in India ink and pencil with tints applied later. However, under the tutelage of George Barret he began to paint in watercolours and also learned print-making techniques.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_15408"></a><span class="headword">Charles John Kennion</span>  (1789&#150;1853), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, exhibited twenty-six works at the Royal Academy between 1804 and 1853, and five works at the Suffolk Street Gallery. His watercolour paintings were much in the style of his father. Charles Kennion died in Robert Street, Regent's Park, London, on 10 September 1853.<br>
