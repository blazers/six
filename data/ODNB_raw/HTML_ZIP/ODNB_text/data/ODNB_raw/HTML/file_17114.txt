<span class="headword">Lowther,  William</span>, second earl of Lonsdale  (1787&#150;1872), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17113/', "Sir William Lowther (1757&#150;1844)")</script>, subsequently Viscount Lowther and first earl of Lonsdale, and Lady Augusta (1761&#150;1838), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9135/', "John Fane, ninth earl of Westmorland")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9134/', "Fane, John, seventh earl of Westmorland")</script>]. He was born at Uffington, near Stamford, Lincolnshire, on 30 July 1787, and educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, whence he graduated MA in 1808. Thanks to the strength of the Lowther interest in Westmorland, he was returned as MP for Cockermouth in 1808&#150;13, and for Westmorland in 1813&#150;31 and 1832&#150;41. The crumbling of the Lowther interest in 1831 over their resolute stance against reform forced him to seek a seat elsewhere, and he represented the pocket borough of Dunwich for the 1832 sessions.<br>
<br>Lowther first took office under Perceval, succeeding Palmerston as junior lord of the Admiralty in 1809; from 1813 to 1826, with a short interval, he was on the Treasury board, and was made first commissioner of woods and forests by the duke of Wellington in 1828. He was president of the Board of Trade in 1834&#150;5, and postmaster-general with a seat in the cabinet in 1841. He was summoned to the House of Lords in his father's barony on 6 September 1841 and succeeded to the earldom in 1844. He was president of council in 1852 in Derby's administration. Although a good business man, Lonsdale was no orator, and took no real initiative in politics. His great wealth, however, and the influence of his family gave him importance in his party, and extra-parliamentary meetings of the tories were frequently held at his house in Carlton House Terrace.<br>
<br>Lonsdale invested greatly in his estates, especially in drainage; he had been in his earlier days a patron of Macadam, the road-maker, and was at his death chairman of the metropolitan roads commission. He was something of a sportsman (his horse Spaniel won the Derby in 1831), paid large subsidies for the maintenance of Italian opera in London, and was an enthusiastic collector of porcelain. He was the distant original of Lord Eskdale in Disraeli's <span class="italic">Tancred</span>, &#145;a man with every ability, except the ability to make his powers useful to mankind&#146;. Unmarried, he acknowledged three children, whose mothers were believed to be opera singers. Marie Caroline was born in Paris in 1818, the daughter of Caroline Saintfal; nothing further is known of her. Frances (<i>d</i>. 1890) married Henry Broadwood MP, in 1840, and was left a substantial sum in her father's will, as was Francis William (1841&#150;1908), the son of Emilia Creosotti.<br>
<br>Lonsdale died at his London house, 14 Carlton House Terrace, on 4 March 1872, and was buried in the mausoleum which he had built at Lowther Castle. He was succeeded by his nephew, Henry Lowther (1818&#150;1876).<br>
