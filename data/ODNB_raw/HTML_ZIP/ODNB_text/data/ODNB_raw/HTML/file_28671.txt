<span class="headword">Warburton,  George Drought</span>  (1816&#150;1857), <span class="occ">army officer and writer on Canada</span>, the third son of George Warburton, of Aughrim, Galway, formerly inspector-general of constabulary in Ireland, and his wife, Anna, the daughter of Thomas Acton of Westaston, co. Wicklow, was born at Wicklow on 2 June 1816. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and served in the Royal Artillery from June 1833. From 1837 to 1838 he was with a detachment of the Royal Artillery serving in the Carlist War in Spain, where he was badly wounded in action. For his services he was made knight of the first class of San Fernando. In July 1844 he was sent to Canada, where he was stationed at Montreal. His anonymous description of the country under the title <span class="italic">Hochelaga, or, England in the New World</span> (2 vols., 1846) was published as &#145;edited by Eliot Warburton&#146;, that is, his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28670/', "Bartholomew Elliott George Warburton")</script>, who had already established himself as a travel writer. George Drought's work quickly ran to several editions in England and the USA and soon became staple reading for travellers.<br>
<br>Warburton returned from Canada in 1846 and was in 1848 promoted captain and served briefly in Corfu; he returned to Woolwich in 1849. The success of his first book encouraged him to write another anonymous work, <span class="italic">The Conquest of Canada</span> (2 vols., 1849), which like the first passed through several editions and was widely read for its mixture of careful research, exotic descriptions, and lively style. In 1850 he was stationed at Harwich, from where he made frequent visits to London and joined Lady Morgan's literary circle with his brother Eliot.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1853 Warburton married at St George's, Hanover Square, Elizabeth Augusta Bateman-Hanbury, the third daughter of the first Lord Bateman (1780&#150;1845) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1882), the daughter of Lord Spencer Stanley Chichester. Their only daughter married Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill. For his next book Warburton followed his brother by turning to biography in his <span class="italic">Memoir of Charles Mordaunt</span> (2 vols., 1853). He retired from the army as a major on full pay in November 1854 to live at Henley House, Frant, Sussex. On 28 March 1857 he became independent Liberal MP for Harwich, having unsuccessfully contested the seat in 1852. He was in favour of extending the franchise, but opposed to the endowment of Maynooth.<br>
<br>Warburton was subject to severe attacks of what has been described as &#145;indigestion&#146; and, gripped by one such attack, shot himself through the head at Henley House on 23 October 1857. He was buried at Iffley, near Oxford, where his brother Thomas Acton was vicar and where there is a monument to his brother Eliot, who also died prematurely in tragic circumstances. Although his work is overshadowed by that of his brother, it was much read in its time.<br>
<br>On 15 April 1869 Warburton's widow married George Rushout, third Lord Northwick, and in 1886 they received the Dunmow Flitch, a side of bacon presented each year at Dunmow, Essex, to a married couple who had lived in harmony for a year and a day.<br>
