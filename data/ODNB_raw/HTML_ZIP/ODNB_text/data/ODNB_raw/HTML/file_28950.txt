<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Weddell,  James</span>  (1787&#150;1834), <span class="occ">navigator</span>, was the younger son of an upholsterer of Dalserf, near Lanark, who had settled in London and there married Sarah Pease, a Quaker. James is said to have been born on 24 August 1787 in Ostend, where the family had removed because of the father's poor health, but his birth there has proved untraceable and he himself gave his place of birth as Massachusetts when he entered the navy in 1810. His father died soon after James's birth, leaving his family with little money. In 1796 James joined his elder brother Charles who was in the Royal Navy in the <i>Swan</i> at Yarmouth; and after this he was at sea, first on a coasting vessel (probably a collier), and later on a frigate, to which he was sent in irons after having struck his captain. Suggestions that this frigate was the <i>Rainbow</i> are probably wrong. In 1810 he entered the navy again on the <i>Rainbow</i>, and was rated first a seaman and then a midshipman, before his discharge in December 1810 on his promotion by warrant to acting master in the <i>Firefly</i>. He eagerly grasped opportunities for study and taught himself navigation. In December 1811 he was moved to the <i>Thalia</i>, and, on her return to England and being paid off, he was on 21 October 1812 promoted master of the <i>Hope</i>. A few months later he was moved to the brig <i>Avon</i> with Commander, later Admiral of the Fleet, Sir George Sartorius, who in 1839 described Weddell as &#145;one of the most efficient and trustworthy officers I have met&#146;. The <i>Avon</i> was paid off in March 1814, and after this he served on the sloop <i>Espoir</i>, the frigate <i>Cydnus</i>, and then the <i>Pactolus</i>.<br>
<br>The peace left Weddell on half pay for three years before he accepted command of the <i>Jane</i>, a brig of 160 tons belonging to Messrs Strachan and Gavin of Leith, for a sealing voyage to the Antarctic. No record is extant of the voyage, which lasted from 1819 until 1821, but Weddell seems to have visited the South Shetland Islands and is credited with having discovered the South Orkneys. The voyage was not profitable, but Weddell persuaded James Strachan to fit out the <i>Jane</i> again and to purchase the cutter <i>Beaufoy</i> for a further voyage which set off on 17 September 1822, searching for fur seals. Weddell reached the Falklands, the South Shetlands, South Georgia, and the South Orkneys, and reached latitude 74&deg; 15", the southernmost latitude then achieved. He returned home in July 1824 and in 1825 published <span class="italic">A Voyage towards the South Pole</span>, which was recognized as of considerable importance for its account of the voyage and its survey of the South Shetlands where names such as Boyd's Strait, Duff's Strait, and Sartorius Island recalled the captains with whom Weddell had served. An enlarged edition and a German translation appeared in 1827, in which year Weddell was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Weddell's later life was marked with misfortune. In 1829 he was trading in Buenos Aires in the <i>Jane</i>, but was forced to abandon her in the Azores on the return journey as she was taking in water. He and his crew embarked as passengers on a ship bound for England, but narrowly escaped death when she was shipwrecked. In 1830 he sailed as master of the <i>Eliza</i>, reaching Hobart, Tasmania, in May 1831, where he met and helped fellow Antarctic explorer John Biscoe. Weddell had transported an alleged escaped convict, Richard Brown, to Hobart, but when Brown cleared his name, he sued Weddell for having transported him against his will. In poor health and penniless since his shipwreck, Weddell died, unmarried, on 9 September 1834, at 16 Norfolk Street, Strand, London, and was buried at St Clement Danes churchyard.<br>
<br>P. G. Dodd described Weddell in earlier life as tall and strongly built, energetic in company, but melancholy when alone  (Savours, 156). William Jerdan suggested that his heart lay in exploration, not commerce, and he seems to have taken hard the misfortunes which lack of means put in his path. Weddell Island and the Weddell Sea in the Antarctic are lasting memorials to his achievements.<br>
