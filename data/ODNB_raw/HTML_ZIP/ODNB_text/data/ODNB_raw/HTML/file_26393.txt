<span class="headword">Stephens,  Thomas</span>  (1549&#150;1619), <span class="occ">Jesuit and missionary</span>, was born at Bushton, Wiltshire, the son of Thomas Stephens, a well-to-do merchant, and Jane, who died in 1575. His brother, Richard (<i>d</i>. 1586), studied at Douai and taught theology after his ordination. Stephens did his humanities privately and also studied at Oxford. He then joined Thomas Pounde, a wealthy gentleman of Belmont, and both, inspired by the lives of Jesuit missionaries in India, sought to work their way to the east. Eventually Stephens went to Rome alone and at the age of twenty-six entered the Jesuit noviciate at Sant' Andrea on 20 October 1575.<br>
<br>Having been allowed to go to India as a missionary, Stephens reached Lisbon at the end of March 1579 and left on 4 April on a fleet of five ships bound for the subcontinent. He reached Goa on 24 October of that year. Soon after arriving he wrote a letter to his father, dated 10 November 1579, wherein he speaks of Goa as a place where they were all &#145;received with passing great charity&#146;. He also wrote about the sea, the rough weather, and the shipmen, soldiers, and children. His letter is important since it helped awaken the interest of the London merchants in the India trade. Stephens also wrote to his brother, Richard, on 24 October 1583, and told him how, owing to the scarcity of priests, he had been ordained and sent to Goa. He described the martyrdom of Rudolf Acquaviva and his companions in Cuncolim (Goa) in 1583.<br>
<br>Stephens was thirty years of age when he arrived in Goa and, after a brief period of theological studies in Old Goa, was sent to the Salcete mission in south Goa, which by 1580 had a college, a hospital, and six churches with about 8000 Christians. Stephens had a love for his fellow Englishmen and when Fitch, Newbury, Leeds, and Story, merchants, who had reached Hormoz by the overland route in December 1583, were arrested by the Portuguese and sent to Goa, it was he who had managed to get them bail and their freedom.<br>
<br>Stephens spent a total of forty years in the Salcete mission. He was rector of the Rachol College, then minister of the professed house at Old Goa, and assistant to the visitor; he also served as parish priest at Rachol, Mormugao, Margao, Benaulim, Bassein, Loutolim, and Navelim. He was said to have had an outstanding missionary talent and apostolic zeal. He had a robust constitution, enjoyed good health, and was energetic, vivacious, and optimistic by nature. One of the Jesuit documents lists him as &#145;of very good wisdom, good judgement and prudence &hellip; and of a very good talent for conversions&#146;. He professed his vows as spiritual coadjutor in Goa in February 1589.<br>
<br>In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Jesuits at Goa began writing Christian <i>puranas</i> (epics) in order to satisfy the desire of the recent converts, who were accustomed to listen to their own esteemed epics. Stephens with his <span class="italic">Purana Christ&atilde;o</span> satisfied this urge of theirs and thus showed the value of inculturation in transmitting the Christian message. He also wrote a Konkani language grammar and a catechism in Konkani. His main work was acclaimed as a masterpiece and the Christians in their enthusiasm insisted on having readings from it in the churches after mass on Sundays and feast days.<br>
<br>Besides his work as epic writer and grammarian Stephens was also involved in the running of the houses and properties under his charge. There were occasional complaints against him, as a letter of Jo&atilde;o da Cunha states. He wrote that the English priest had appropriated to the college of Salcete the rents of the palmgrove and lands which actually belonged to the church of St John the Baptist, for that was the intention of the donor. Stephens also had an interest in the country and the environment, and once sent a map of the island of Goa, and of Bardez and Salcete, to Europe that &#145;there will be a better understanding of this region&#146;. He hoped also to send an improved one to the father-general.<br>
<br>Stephens died at Salcete in 1619. He has lived on in his works, principally in his <span class="italic">Grammar</span> and his <span class="italic">Catechism</span> (composed for his fellow missionaries), but pre-eminently in his <span class="italic">Purana Christ&atilde;o</span>. Until the end of his life he remained an extraordinary missionary in Goa, by nature humble, and a man with a great literary output in Konkani.<br>
