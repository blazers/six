<span class="headword">Lacy,  Hugh  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1186), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of an unknown mother and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15849/', "Gilbert de Lacy (fl. 1133&#150;1163)")</script>. In 1158 or 1159 Gilbert became a knight templar and by 1159&#150;60 had been succeeded as lord of Weobley, Herefordshire (one of the family's chief castles), by his son Robert. By 1162 Robert, in turn, had been succeeded by Hugh, presumably his younger brother. Hugh de Lacy thus became an important tenant-in-chief of the crown. He held fees hereditarily in Normandy at Lassy and Campeaux; additionally about 1172&#150;3 he obtained by purchase of 200 livres angevins the honour of Le Pin from Robert, count of Meulan, to be held of Henry II for 2 knights' fees. In 1166 he made a return to the king stating that in England he had 54&frac14; fees of old feoffment, of which, however, 3&frac12; fees were not acknowledged as his by their holders; he also had 5&frac12; fees of new feoffment, land worth 800<i>s</i>., and 9 resident knights maintained in his household. In 1167/8 scutage was calculated on 51&frac14; knights' fees, indicating that Lacy had not recovered the contested fees. Lacy did not pay scutage in 1164/5, suggesting that he participated in person in Henry II's campaign from Shrewsbury into north Wales in 1165.<br>
<br>Lacy accompanied Henry II to Ireland in October 1171. Gerald of Wales certainly exaggerated, if he did not entirely invent, a meeting at the River Shannon between Lacy, William fitz Aldelin, and Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht and claimant to the high-kingship, at which the latter supposedly offered submission to Henry II. Hugh de Lacy had definitely attained a prominent position in the king's entourage. Before Henry left Ireland in April 1172 he granted Lacy the kingdom of Mide for the service of 50 knights, as well as custody of the city of Dublin which the king retained as royal demesne. The terms suggest the king's determination that tenure of the Irish lordships should be more strictly controlled than that of the semi-autonomous Welsh marcher domains. Such had been the confusion over the kingship of Mide in the previous twenty years that Henry specifically granted the kingdom &#145;as it had been held by Murchad Ua M&aacute;el Sechlainn&#146;  (Orpen, 1.285&#150;6), who had died in 1153. One Irish contender for the lordship of Mide, Tigern&aacute;n Ua Ruairc, king of Br&eacute;ifne, had made such inroads into Mide in the immediate pre-Norman period that he is actually termed &#145;king of Mide&#146; by Gerald  (<span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 95, 113). Lacy assassinated Ua Ruairc at the hill of Tlachtga (Ward, Meath) in 1172 while negotiations between the two were in progress.<br>
<br>Lacy was back in England by 29 December 1172, the anniversary of the death of Archbishop Thomas Becket, when he was at Canterbury, probably <i>en route</i> for Normandy. In the summer of 1173 he fought on Henry II's behalf in Normandy and in July held the castle of Verneuil against Louis VII of France, although eventually it was forced to capitulate. Lacy can be traced intermittently in Henry's entourage up to 1177. In May 1177 he was present at the Council of Oxford, when arrangements were made for the administration of the Angevin lordship in Ireland following the death in April 1176 of Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare (Strongbow), earl of Pembroke and Striguil and lord of Leinster. According to Gerald of Wales, Lacy was appointed as the king's <i>procurator generalis</i> in Ireland  (<span class="italic">Expugnatio</span>, 183), but the diplomatic of royal records indicates that it was William fitz Aldelin who exercised the role of principal royal agent in Ireland at this time. The king may have considered that his bond with William fitz Aldelin, a long-standing administrator and member of the royal <i>familia</i>, was more dependable than his personal relationship with Lacy as a tenurial vassal. Few such administrators were available to Henry in Ireland, however, and in 1177 Lacy retained custody of the royal demesne of Dublin. Extant documents testify to his administrative role. In 1176/7 the sheriff of Shropshire accounted for 200 bushels of wheat sent to Lacy in Ireland; in 1177/8 he received 200 bushels from Dorset and Somerset and 300 from Gloucestershire, while 500 bushels were shipped with his servants in 1178/9 for the use of the king's <i>familia</i> in Ireland. None the less, Henry II evidently remained wary of Lacy's intentions, and in the summer of 1177 took into his hand Lacy's demesne castle of Ludlow, which he retained for the remainder of Lacy's life: this would have had the effect of weakening Lacy power in the central Welsh march and may therefore have been intended as a mechanism of royal control in case Hugh de Lacy overstepped his position in Ireland.<br>
<br>The so-called <span class="italic">Song of Dermot and the Earl</span> gives an account of Hugh de Lacy's subinfeudation of Mide. The details of the process are obscure as only three charter-texts of enfeoffment survive. Settlement seems to have proceeded on the basis of pre-existing units&#151;the charters give the Irish names of the lands and their previous holders&#151;which were now held by knights' service, orientated towards a castle. The precise number of castles that Lacy built in Mide is unknown. His castle at Trim was to become the <i>caput</i> of the Anglo-Norman lordship of Mide. Some of his castles reused royal sites of the pre-Norman kingdom of Mide. Gerald of Wales praised Lacy in contrast to William fitz Aldelin, for fortifying Leinster and Mide with castles and pacifying Ireland. Lacy also dispensed religious patronage from his new lordship. He endowed Llanthony Prima, in Gwent, and Llanthony Secunda, in Gloucestershire, with extensive ecclesiastical benefices and lands in Mide, founding a cell of Llanthony Prima at Colp and a cell of Llanthony Secunda at Duleek. He founded a Benedictine alien priory at Fore, Westmeath, as a dependency of St Taurin, &Eacute;vreux, and was a benefactor of St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin, the Augustinian priory of Kells, Meath, and the archbishopric of Dublin.<br>
<br>Some of Lacy's activities did nothing to lessen the king's suspicion of him. In 1178 he reached an accommodation with Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, who had repulsed him after he had plundered the ecclesiastical site of Clonmacnoise, co. Offaly, with the Dublin garrison. Without Henry II's permission, Lacy married Ua Conchobair's daughter around this time, which apparently displeased Henry, and may have led to Lacy's recall to England in 1179 and again in 1181. In late 1181 or 1182, however, Lacy returned to Ireland, this time as the king's principal agent, though a royal clerk, Robert of Shrewsbury, was to oversee his actions. In September 1184 he was recalled again and replaced by a royal <i>familiaris</i>, Philip of Worcester, one of whose first actions was to seek the recovery of Saithne, in the north of the county of Dublin, which Hugh de Lacy was deemed to have misappropriated from the royal demesne of Dublin. When Henry II's son John went to assume the lordship of Ireland in person in 1185, he is said by the annals of Loch C&eacute; to have reported back to Henry that Lacy had prevented the Irish kings from giving him tribute or hostages.<br>
<br>Hugh de Lacy was assassinated at Durrow on 26 July 1186. He was beheaded with an axe by Gillaganinathair &Oacute; Miadaig of Bregmuine at the direction of In Sinnach Ua Ceithernaig, king of Tethba, perhaps to avenge the killing of the latter's son in battle against the Anglo-Normans eight years earlier. The annals of Loch C&eacute; describe Lacy at the time of his death as &#145;king of Mide and Br&eacute;ifne, and Airgialla&#146;, and further state that &#145;it was to him that the tribute of Connacht was paid&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annals of Loch C&eacute;</span>, 1.173). Roger of Howden and William of Newburgh claim that news of Lacy's death was welcomed by Henry II, while Newburgh adds that the king intended to send John back to Ireland to seize Lacy's lands and castles. Lacy was buried at Durrow in 1186. His honour of Weobley was in the hands of the crown until his son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15864/', "Walter de Lacy (d. 1241)")</script>, came of age in 1189. In 1195, in moves probably linked to the assumption of the lordship of Mide by Walter, Hugh de Lacy's body was recovered at the instigation of Muirges Ua h&Eacute;nna, archbishop of Cashel and papal legate, and John Cumin, archbishop of Dublin, and removed to Bective Abbey, Meath, while his head was buried at St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin. Further controversy over his remains ended in 1205 with a papal judgment in favour of removal of the body to St Thomas's, where it was buried alongside that of his first wife, Rose, widow of Baderon of Monmouth (<i>d</i>. 1170&times;76), and mother of his sons, Walter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15853/', "Hugh de Lacy (d. 1242)")</script>, Gilbert, and Robert. Rose died some time before 1180, by when Lacy had taken as his second wife the daughter of Ruaidr&iacute; Ua Conchobair, the elder, with whom he had a son, William Gorm, deemed to be illegitimate, who was to act in close concert with his half-brothers.<br>
