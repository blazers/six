<span class="headword">Baines,  Peter</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Augustine]</span>  (1786&#150;1843), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the western district</span>, was born on 25 June 1786 at Pear Tree Farm, Kirkby, near Liverpool, the elder son of James Baines, &#145;farmer and yeoman&#146;  (<span class="roman">will</span>, proved 1809, TNA: PRO), and his second wife, Catherine. He had a younger brother, Thomas. This Lancashire family was legendary for its steadfastness in the old faith  (Baines file, Preston City Archives). At twelve years old Baines went on a scholarship as a boarder to the English Benedictine school at Lambspring in Hanover. After the suppression of the house by Prussia in April 1803, Baines and his schoolmates returned to England to join the sister Benedictine community of St Laurence, newly settled at Ampleforth in Yorkshire; there he was professed a monk in 1804, taking the name Augustine, and was ordained priest in 1810. He became a leading member of the small Ampleforth community, serving as procurator and then prefect of studies. In 1817 the president of the English Benedictine congregation appointed him chief missioner (parish priest) of the busy and fashionable city of Bath. A graphic picture of his daily round during the six years he spent there can be seen in his diary of 1817&#150;19, which has been transcribed and published by the Catholic Record Society. He had by this time built a reputation he was never to lose as an outstanding and eloquent preacher.<br>
<br>At the general chapter of the English Benedictine congregation in 1822 Baines was elected first definitor of the regimen. His talents and his energy were recognized outside the congregation as well as within it, and in 1823 the vicar apostolic of the western district, Bishop Peter Bernardine Collingridge, chose (as was then the custom) Baines as his coadjutor with right of succession (the bishop for this extensive and poor district had traditionally been selected from the regular clergy).<br>
<br>Once consecrated, Baines began to prepare for the establishment of a seminary for the district. At first he looked to his Benedictine confr&egrave;res to assist in this (Bishop Brown of Wales was to initiate a similar plan in 1850). In August 1826 Baines invited both the community of St Gregory, then at nearby Downside, which refused, and his own community of St Laurence at Ampleforth, from which he received an encouraging response. A measure of disagreement over these plans led him to put them aside until 1829, when he succeeded to the vicariate.<br>
<br>The intervening years were spent in Rome, whither Baines had travelled to recover from a serious illness. The experience was a formative one. As he later declared: &#145;In the Western District all that concerns the exterior of Religion is rigorously fashioned upon the Roman model &hellip; infinitely better suited for a country like England&#146;  (P. A. Baines, <span class="italic">A History of the Pastoral</span>, 1841, 17&#150;18). He made many friends and was especially favoured by Leo XII, who, according to many sources, intended to name him cardinal. He was appointed bishop assistant to the pontifical throne, and in that capacity attended the conclave electing Pius VIII in April 1829. This year, which had seen the death of Leo XII and of Bishop Collingridge, was also the year of the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Act</span> in England. Baines was eager for the Roman Catholic church in England to move into the open, to build churches and schools which were now no longer illegal, and to take a place in public life.<br>
<br>Soon after his return to England, in December 1829, Baines bought the mansion of Prior Park, on one of the hills of Bath; he planned to make of it, like Oscott, a school, a seminary, and the bishop's residence. Using stone from the quarries at Combe Down above Prior Park, he adapted harmoniously the wings of the building to form the two colleges of St Peter (opened 1830) and St Paul (opened 1837). His most striking addition was the great flight after flight of steps leading from the Corinthian portico, with terraces laid out below. Finding an appropriate teaching faculty for these colleges caused headaches. For a while (1835&#150;42) a small group of men from the newly formed Institute of Charity came from Italy, but their style proved unsuitable for an English school. In 1835 Nicholas Wiseman responded to Baines's proposal that he should become president of Prior Park. In the event Wiseman chose to settle in the midland district, at Oscott. Baines's original preference for his Benedictine confr&egrave;res (he had hoped for a helpful reshuffle of personnel) had been disappointed. Dispute over this had involved, too, uncertainty about the canonical status of the Benedictine houses, and their consequent exemption&#151;or otherwise&#151;from the jurisdiction of the bishop while working on the district mission. The matter of episcopal jurisdiction exercised both Bishop Challoner (1691&#150;1781) and Bishop Vaughan (1832&#150;1903) and even the papal ruling secured by the latter, the bull <span class="italic">Romanos pontifices</span> (1881), did not finally clear up the matter of episcopal authority, based on edicts of the Council of Trent. The hostility engendered between the Benedictine factions was technically resolved by an official arbitration overseen by Bishop Scott of Glasgow in July 1835 in which all were cleared of blame. But the poor relations engendered grew into a legend.<br>
<br>All the same, despite such ups and downs, Prior Park blossomed, and St Peter's College &#145;in Bishop Baines's hands at once became the most advanced and progressive of the catholic schools&#146;  (C. Butler, <span class="italic">Downside Review</span>, 1931, 333). Another tribute was paid by a young monk of the community of St Gregory of that time (1811&#150;32): W. P. Morris, later speaking as a bishop at the golden jubilee of Downside in 1864, called Baines &#145;the ornament and pride of the Benedictine body in modern times&#146;  (W. P. Morris to J. Bonomi, n.d., Clifton Diocesan Archives). Had Baines not died suddenly at a comparatively young age Prior Park would no doubt have financially secured itself. In 1840 the University of London presented a charter to St Paul's College warranting it to issue certificates to candidates for degrees.<br>
<br>The College of St Peter was run on original, creative, humane lines. Many records testify to Baines as far in advance of his time as an educator. His very individual views can be found in his book <span class="italic">A Course of Studies</span> (1838), in which he encouraged children &#145;to form their own ideas&#146;, and teachers to avoid &#145;teasings and scoldings&#146;, &#145;a cross and surly tone&#146;, and &#145;irksome drudgery&#146; in lessons. &#145;The more children can learn whilst in motion and in the open air the better&#146;, he continued. The result was a style of practical involvement&#151;a far cry from other schools of the period. This can be seen in the lengthy press reports of the yearly public examinations and exhibitions, and is evident too from the reminiscences of pupils such as Louis Guibara, who recalled not only the joys of fives in the Ball Place, skating and swimming at the Ponds, birdwatching, picnics, and &#145;building houses&#146; in the Rainbow Wood and the Wilderness, but also the musical tradition at the school with the bishop watching rehearsals from a gallery: &#145;It is impossible to exaggerate the influence which that training had upon our lives.&#146;<br>
<br>At Prior Park, T. J. Brindle, Baines's loyal vicar-general, later received into the church many of the most distinguished of the Oxford converts, including Ambrose St John, F. and J. M. Capes, and Robert Aston Coffin. J. H. Newman recommended Prior Park to his close friends the Bowdens as being likely to suit their son &#145;better than any other college&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters and Diaries of John Henry Newman</span>, ed. C. S. Dessain and others, 31 vols., 1&#150;10, 2nd edn, 1978&#150;, vol. 9). Records also testify to Baines's social conscience: from his letter to the <span class="italic">Bath and Cheltenham Gazette</span> in 1817, when he was chief missioner there, &#145;in favour of a poor black imprisoned for begging&#146; to his last Lenten pastoral letter in 1843, in which he chided &#145;a great empire of which a large proportion are paupers in the midst of overflowing plenty; we are oppressors of the poor who have a claim in justice upon us&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, 18 March 1843).<br>
<br>In 1839 Baines had had a census taken of his district, and his Lenten pastoral letter of February 1840 reflected on the subject of the civil position of Catholics in England and dwelt on the duty in charity of not provoking their &#145;separated brethren&#146;&#151;as he was criticized for calling the Anglican majority. The pastoral letter, and the twenty charges against it by anonymous &#145;converts&#146;, exemplify the changes which had taken place in Catholic life since the election of Gregory XVI in 1831. Baines was not happy either with the crusade for the conversion of England, initiated by Spencer, or with the Italianate devotional style and practices becoming popular: a contrast to the minimized tone and dry piety which English Catholics had hitherto preferred both by temperament and by precedent.<br>
<br>A Particular Sacred Congregation of eight cardinals in Rome considered the pastoral letter, together with Baines's written defence of it, to which lengthy comments were appended. There was no question of doctrinal error, but Baines was criticized for a &#145;caustic tone&#146;  (vol. 156, Anglia file, Archives of the Collegio di Propaganda Fide, Rome). During the months thus spent in Rome, Baines had several meetings with Gregory XVI (who as Cardinal Capellari, a Camaldolese monk and fellow regular, was a friend of ten years' standing). Required to clarify certain points, Baines stated &#145;I approve whatever the Church or its organ the Holy See approves.&#146; He complained that not one of his accusers had come forward  (<span class="italic">Letter to Sir Charles Wolseley</span>, 1841 [privately printed]). This lack of openness was alien to his own temperament, which was characteristically candid and ready to square up to a challenge. The petty intrigues continued, though his fellow bishops presented a loyally united front. Bishop John Briggs of the northern district wrote to Bishop Brown of Lancashire, then in Rome, about rumours that Baines might be superseded: &#145;How astonished and indignant would the catholic body throughout England be to find themselves dragged in the train of Phillipps's and Spencer's war of Enthusiasm&#146;  (to Bishop Brown, 15 Feb 1842, Clifton Diocesan Archives).<br>
<br>In March 1842 Baines suffered a stroke; he recovered, but on 6 July 1843 he died in his sleep. Portraits of Baines show a dark-haired man with a dignified bearing, a forceful countenance, and a smile of great felicity. Mary Russell Mitford, describing her one meeting with him, at Prior Park, gave her impression of his humour and intellect: &#145;The little tinct he retained from his rustic origin&#146;, as she recalled, gave him &#145;the finishing grace of truth&#146;. While some had been at odds with him, Baines also inspired an ardent and stubborn loyalty. Bernard Ward described the reaction to his sudden death: &#145;The consternation was beyond description, and can only be imagined by recalling the enthusiastic devotion to his person which reigned among those who were nearest to him&#151;a fact which should never be forgotten&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sequel to Catholic Emancipation</span>, 2.57). Within ten years Prior Park was closed and its contents sold. The body of Baines, which had been buried in accordance with his wishes in the chapel, was taken to Downside. William Clifford, a one-time pupil at Prior Park, on becoming bishop of Clifton in 1866, bought back the premises, and re-established a school. While he was missioner at Bath, Baines had become guardian of a young girl, Anna Mendoza y Rios. She married in 1829 Sir Patrick Bellew of Barmeath, later MP for co. Louth and the first Baron Bellew of the second creation.<br>
