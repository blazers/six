<span class="headword">Guala</span> <span class="st"> [Guala Bicchieri]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1150&#150;1227), <span class="occ">papal official</span>, was a native of Vercelli in Lombardy. First recorded in 1187, he appears to have been trained in theology and law, possibly in France as well as Italy. Made cardinal-deacon of Santa Maria in Portico by Innocent III in 1205, Guala was papal legate successively in north Italy (1206&#150;7) and France (1208&#150;9), and was promoted to be cardinal-priest of San Martino in Montibus in 1211. Following the Fourth Lateran Council, at a date after 14 January 1216, he was appointed papal legate to England, possibly at the request of King John himself. Guala's experience particularly suited him to hold this legation, and his reconstructed <i>acta</i> help to throw light on the last year of John's reign and the early years of Henry III's. The importance of Guala's role was enhanced by the absence from England of the exiled Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury, between September 1215 and May 1218. The new legate's involvement in English affairs extended back to the Evesham Abbey case of 1206. From 1213 he was enjoying an annual pension of 20 marks from England, and he is known to have been well informed on the activities of Nicol&ograve; of Tusculum, his predecessor there as papal legate (1213&#150;14). The terms of Guala's commission from Innocent III are not recorded but, judging by their confirmation by Honorius III, they included the power to reform and to excommunicate, the preaching of the crusade, and the forging of a peace, or at least a truce, between England and France.<br>
<br>Soon after 24 February 1216 Guala set out from Rome for England. He took with him a commission from Innocent III to be presented at the Council of Melun (24&#150;25 April 1216), instructing Philip Augustus and Prince Louis that the latter should not accept the rebels' offer of the English crown. On pain of excommunication the legate forbade in the strongest terms, either Louis to invade England in pursuit of his claim, or Philip to support such an invasion. None the less, on 21 May, Louis and his men landed in England. Guala was delayed by French denial of safe passage across the channel, but his first action on eventually reaching England via Germany was to implement his threat by convening a clerical council at Winchester on 29 May 1216. There he issued a solemn sentence of excommunication against Louis.<br>
<br>The importance in political terms of Guala's legation was greatly increased not only by Langton's absence but also by the death on 19 October 1216 of King John. He had entrusted his young son, Henry III, to Guala, who was one of the executors of his will, as the representative of the Holy See. As the boy was a papal vassal and ward, the legate acted as his protector and supervised his coronation on 28 October at Gloucester. This was an essential first step in overcoming those rebels who had called on Louis of France.<br>
<br>Although the principal English rebels had been excommunicated before his arrival, Guala was instrumental in offering plenary indulgence to all those who fought in the king's cause, thus elevating the venture to the status of a crusade. Honorius III, in letters of 17 January 1217, allowed Guala to dispense crusaders from their vows to the Holy Land if they were fighting for the king and against the rebels. So it was that at the battle of Lincoln, on 20 May 1217, the king's supporters wore white crosses over their armour. After the French fleet was destroyed in a naval battle off Sandwich on 24 August 1217, Louis was believed to have been brought to abandon the struggle by his fear that Guala would win over the city of London, the last stronghold of the rebels. The treaty of Kingston (or Lambeth) was negotiated between 11 and 20 September 1217. Guala administered absolution, imposed penance, and bound Louis and the French to the payment of a subsidy for the recovery of the Holy Land. The treaty excluded the clergy of both countries. The French clergy who had accompanied Louis into England were to perform penance while the English clergy who supported Louis were to be deprived of benefices and subjected to punishment. Several were forced to go to Rome to seek absolution.<br>
<br>His position as legate made Guala nominally the king's leading counsellor. His involvement in secular government, and the restoration of order in England, was by no means limited; thus he set his seal to reissues of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> and the charter of the forest in 1216 and 1217, negotiated with Llywelyn of Wales and Alexander II, king of Scots, sanctioned the measure of February 1218 to call in arrears of scutage, and was the first witness to regulations issued in November 1218 for the use of Henry III's new seal. But in such matters he acted with William (I) Marshal and others, and contemporaries were probably more impressed by his measures against rebel clerics and infringers of the interdict. He may, indeed, have been unduly zealous, depriving some one hundred clerks of their benefices, and purging the chapter of St Paul's, London. Pandulf, who succeeded him as legate, released thirteen ecclesiastics from the imprisonment to which Guala had condemned them, and may have restored some of those he had deprived. Among those who benefited from the vacancies so created were a number of Italians, some of them Guala's kinsmen or members of his household. He was himself alleged, perhaps correctly, to have profited financially from his legation, and he certainly took advantage of his position to secure the advowson of Chesterton, Cambridgeshire, for the Augustinian priory he was in process of founding at Vercelli. Yet the grant was justified by reference to Guala's having &#145;laboured long and hard for the king's peace and the peace of the realm&#146;  (Vincent, 15), and his labours, which also included introducing and implementing the decrees of the Fourth Lateran Council, and the preaching of the fifth crusade, had indeed been considerable. They were still remembered nearly fifty years later, in 1264, when another papal legate, Guy Foulquois, was trying to end another English civil war.<br>
<br>Guala's legation was terminated by papal letters of 12 September 1218. He appears to have relinquished his office at Reading in mid-November, and to have left England shortly afterwards. On his way back to Rome, in February and March 1219, he had the satisfaction of seeing the foundation of the priory of San Andrea in Vercelli. Guala's remaining years in the curia were active ones, and he retained his contacts with England, continuing to receive his pension until 1222. In 1225 he was appointed as one of two legates to southern Italy, negotiating the treaty of San Germano by which Frederick II agreed to undertake a crusade. Guala outlived Honorius III by two months. He made his will on 29 May 1227, and died in Rome on 31 May; he was probably buried in the church of St John Lateran there.<br>
