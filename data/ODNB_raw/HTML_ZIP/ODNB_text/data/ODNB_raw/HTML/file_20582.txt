<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ogden,  Samuel</span>  (1716&#150;1778), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 28 July 1716 at Manchester, the only son of Thomas Ogden (1690/91&#150;1766), a dyer of Manchester, who died aged seventy-five, leaving a widow, who lived to be eighty-five. He was educated at the Manchester Free Grammar School, then admitted briefly at King's College, Cambridge, as a sizar in March 1733 before entering St John's College in August 1736. From there he graduated BA in 1737, MA in 1741, BD in 1748, and DD in 1753. He was elected a fellow of St John's on 24 March 1740, being the senior fellow from 1758 to 1768. Ogden was &#145;an excellent classical scholar, a scientific divine, and a proficient in the Oriental languages&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Ogden was ordained priest by the bishop of Lincoln in November 1741. He moved to Yorkshire, where he was appointed curate of Coley, Halifax, in 1745, and of Elland two years later. He also acted as master of the Heath grammar school, Halifax, from 1744 until 1753. The Cambridge antiquary William Cole considered him a born schoolmaster and regretted that he left the profession, but Cole's description of the way in which he would return to his old school in Manchester &#145;and terrify the boys by his strict and severe examination&#146;  (Hughes, 1.ii) casts doubt on his pedagogical abilities.<br>
<br>In 1753 Ogden returned to Cambridge, having been appointed vicar of the round church of the Holy Sepulchre there. It was here that he made his name as a preacher, his congregations consisting chiefly of members of the university. His return to Cambridge was also marked by his taking the degree of DD, performing disputations with John Green, afterwards bishop of Lincoln, as his opponent. Green's patron, the duke of Newcastle (chancellor of the university), was so impressed by Ogden's performance that in 1754 he conferred on him the vicarage of Damerham in Wiltshire&#151;a post he held until 1766. However, despite Newcastle's favour, Ogden was denied further advancement from him because he proved not to be a &#145;<i>producable</i> man; for he was singularly uncouth in his manner, and spoke his mind very freely upon all occasions&#146;  (Gunning, 1.237). His university connections nevertheless secured him a number of preferments: in 1764 he was appointed to the Woodwardian professorship of geology and in 1766 he was presented to the college living of Lawford in Essex. The former post he accepted without any knowledge of the field&#151;a situation he did little to change during his tenure of office, which lasted until his death. Ogden's hopes of becoming master of his college were conclusively dashed at the elections of both 1765 and 1775; he gained a mere three votes on the latter occasion. However, in 1766 he obtained the rectory of Stansfield in Suffolk, a post in the gift of the lord chancellor.<br>
<br>Though known for his rusticity of manner in most social situations, in the pulpit he was considered &#145;remarkably striking&#146;, commanding &#145;the attention of all who heard him&#146;  (Hallifax, 1.ix&#150;x). Indeed, his rather singular mannerisms appear to have enhanced his abilities as a preacher. For he had &#145;a sallow complexion, stern expression of countenance, and very vivid black eyes&#146;, and a deep and solemn tone of voice that helped to capture the attention of his audience  (Whitaker, 388). In their printed form, too, Ogden's sermons were widely admired by his contemporaries, including George III and Bishop Hurd, who urged that they be put into the hands of the young princes. Boswell, who admired their &#145;subtility of reasoning&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), persuaded Dr Johnson to read them and was heartened that Johnson &#145;praised my favourite preacher, his elegant language, and remarkable acuteness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's Life of Johnson</span>, 5.350). Johnson also considered that &#145;he fought infidels with their own weapons&#146;  (ibid., 5.351). There is nothing exceptional in the theology embodied in the sermons with its familiar eighteenth-century appeal to the authority both of the scriptures and of reason. Ogden urged, for example, the way in which one could come to a knowledge of the Creator even without revelation, through &#145;the contemplation of the works of nature&#146;, and, in the language of physico-theology, argued that: &#145;Articles of faith are established &hellip; upon as good grounds as systems of physics&#146;  (Hughes, 1.126&#150;7). He also expressed his distaste for &#145;enthusiasm&#146; by contending that religion &#145;is seen to best advantage when adorned with moderation&#146;  (ibid., 2.19).<br>
<br>In appearance Ogden was &#145;a stout and very athletic man&#146;  (Whitaker, 388) and he was evidently a good trencherman, since one of his few remembered remarks is that a goose was a silly bird, being too much for one and not enough for two. For all his personal idiosyncrasies he was generally respected. Gilbert Wakefield, for example, considered him &#145;a good scholar, a liberal-minded Christian, and an honest man&#146;  (Hughes, 1.v). He died following a fit on 23 March 1778 and was buried on the south side of the communion table at the church of the Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge, where a table was raised to his memory. Ogden left his Arabic books to William Craven, master of St John's College, who, through Ogden's influence, had been appointed to the professorship of Arabic.<br>
