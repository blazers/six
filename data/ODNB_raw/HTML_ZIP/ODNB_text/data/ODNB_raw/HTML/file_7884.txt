<span class="headword">Douglas,  George</span>, fourth earl of Angus  (<em>c.</em>1417&#150;1463), <span class="occ">courtier and soldier</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7926/', "William Douglas, second earl of Angus (c.1398&#150;1437)")</script>, and his wife, Margaret (<i>fl</i>. 1410&#150;1484), daughter of Sir William Hay of Yester. He succeeded to the earldom on the death of his childless elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54166/', "James Douglas")</script>, in 1446. William Douglas, who had been a prominent crown servant in the reign of James I, died shortly after the king, and his eldest son failed to make his mark at court. Earl George, however, seems to have established himself quickly there after his succession, but managed to avoid entanglement with the notorious Livingston faction, whose fall in late 1449 had widespread ramifications. Furthermore, although he continued to witness crown charters thereafter, he was not caught up in the collapse of the Black Douglases either, and indeed it was the final defeat of the earls of Douglas in May 1455 which brought him further prestige.<br>
<br>Angus was by this time seldom at court, yet James II granted him the lordship of Douglas, Lanarkshire, which had been forfeited by James, ninth earl of Douglas. Earl George already possessed major estates (most of them held in regality) in Forfarshire (Angus), Fife, Perthshire, Haddingtonshire, Dumfriesshire, Selkirkshire, Berwickshire, and Roxburghshire. His becoming lord of Douglas represented a significant accretion of honour, marking that he was now the senior member of the house of Douglas. He had succeeded his brother as warden of the east marches (against England), and after the defeat of the Black Douglases he obtained the wardenship of the middle marches as well. He shared the military preoccupations of his father. He and others invaded England to counter raids from the south and burnt Alnwick, probably in 1448. He may have had a role in the rout of the Douglases in 1455; and some accounts suggest that he was standing beside James II at the siege of Roxburgh in August 1460 when the king received the fatal blow from a Scottish gun which shattered when fired, and was himself injured.<br>
<br>Although the family historian, David Hume of Godscroft (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1630), relates that at the coronation of the eight-year-old James III on 10 August 1460 Angus seized the crown and put it on the head of the new king, challenging anyone else to remove it, he seems to have played little part in political life during the opening years of the minority administration. It is certain, however, that the earl sought to profit from the civil war in England. When Henry VI fled with his family to Scotland, in 1461, he contracted with Angus to enlist his support against the Yorkists, in return for which Angus would be created an English duke and would obtain a castle and territory to the value of 2000 marks, on the north side of the rivers Trent and Humber. Angus supplied material help in January 1463 by relieving Edward IV's forces' siege of Alnwick, where French troops raised by Henry VI's spouse, Margaret of Anjou, had taken refuge. But before Angus could capitalize on this he died, on 12 March 1463; he was apparently buried beside his ancestors in the collegiate church of St Bride, Abernethy, Perthshire.<br>
<br>Hume of Godscroft regards Angus as the earl who securely founded the family's fortunes, and gives him the sobriquet &#145;the Great Earl&#146;. After the fall of the Black Douglases, Earl George was careful to build up his following, particularly when he had assumed the lordship of Douglas. Most notably, he persuaded some greater and lesser barons to effect bonds of manrent to him. Recent scholarship has suggested that these bonds, which first appear in the 1440s, indicate efforts by a new nobility within Scotland to establish their status. Forfeitures in the reigns of James I and James II fell hard on many old noble families. The new nobility sought to assure themselves of support among the lairds by securing written, personal promises of loyalty, often for life, in return for maintenance of the subscribers' interests. Angus received bonds from barons whose estates lay in Roxburghshire, Lanarkshire, and Forfarshire, including two lords of parliament: James Hamilton, first Lord Hamilton of Cadzow (<i>d</i>. 1479), and John Somerville, second Lord Somerville (<i>d</i>. 1491). Hamilton, formerly a leading adherent of the Black Douglases, had changed sides in 1455 and been given forfeited Douglas estates. His giving a bond to Angus represents a striking demonstration of regional supremacy on the latter's part. Earl George is also said to have taken a wider perspective of his family estates, moving their centre from Perthshire and Forfarshire to his border strongholds, notably Jedburgh and Hermitage in Liddesdale; but he is often found in Edinburgh, presumably with the king's court, and in 1455 he received the king's permission to construct and fortify a castle at Broughty, Forfarshire.<br>
<br>Earl George married, apparently before his elder brother's death, Isabel, daughter of Sir John Sibbald of Balgonie, master of the king's household in the 1440s. They had two sons, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7864/', "Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus")</script>, and six daughters. Shortly before Earl George died Archibald was contracted to marry a daughter of Alexander Seton, first earl of Huntly, but the marriage is not known to have occurred. After her husband's death Isabel married John Carmichael of Balmedie (by 1477) and then Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven (by 1489). She had died by February 1503.<br>
