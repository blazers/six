<span class="headword">Lowndes,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1692, <em>d.</em> 1748), <span class="occ">colonial official and benefactor</span>, was baptized at Astbury, Cheshire, on 7 December 1692. He was the second son of William Lowndes of Overton, an estate at Astbury, and his wife and cousin Elizabeth, daughter of Ralph Lowndes of Lea Hall. Thomas spent his childhood at Lea Hall, and through family influence became a clerk to the Treasury.<br>
<br>On 27 September 1725 Lowndes received from the lords proprietors of South Carolina the patent of provost marshal. He never visited the colony, entrusting his duties to a deputy, but he profited substantially from financial dues paid to him as holder of the position. In this capacity he urged the crown's purchase of the colony, arguing for the colony's fertile soil, ease of defence, disunion among its proprietors, and its potential to restrain French and Spanish expansion. He also advanced schemes promoting foreign emigration to the colony, the manufacture of potash, and the incorporation of North Carolina with Virginia.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1730 George II renewed Lowndes's patent of provost marshal, which he had surrendered at the transference of the colony to the crown in 1727. However, its value was greatly reduced by an act declaring all process null and void unless served by the provost marshal or his deputy in person. Lowndes did his utmost to have the <span class="roman">Summons Act</span>, which in the days of the lords proprietors had screened the abuses of the provost marshals, restored. When the assembly rejected this proposal he accused&#151;possibly upon false information&#151;Governor Robert Johnson of purposely withholding the motion. Johnson, writing from Charles Town on 28 September 1732, warned the Board of Trade against listening to the insinuations of a man who &#145;by the neglect of the late lords proprietors had made the province his property to the extent of &pound;4,000 or &pound;5,000, by no other merit than a consummate assurance&#146;. In 1733 Lowndes resigned his patent of provost marshal, and it was not again renewed.<br>
<br>In the following decade Lowndes turned his attention to questions of domestic trade. In 1745 he published <span class="italic">A Method to Prevent, without a Register, the Running of Wool from Ireland to France</span>, in which he blamed the decay of the British woollen manufacture on the restrictions placed on Irish trade. Appealing to the example of the Netherlands, Lowndes proposed to allow Ireland to manufacture in the Isle of Man home-grown wool into cloth and from there import it into England duty-free. The proposal met with no success and his attempt to introduce the measure in parliament came to nothing. He had better fortune with a project to supply the navy with salt, much of which then took the form of poor-quality imports. He developed his own method of producing salt which he advocated in a pamphlet in 1746. His specimens were highly praised by the Royal College of Physicians (their report, dated 27 August 1745, was printed with the pamphlet), but the Admiralty refused his terms. Lowndes carried the scheme to the House of Commons, and in June 1746 the house petitioned the king to instruct the Admiralty to accept the terms. Additional statements on the merits of his proposal included <span class="italic">A Seasonable Hint for our Pilchard and Coast Fishery</span> and a letter from Lowndes &#145;to the salt proprietors of Great Britain&#146; (both 1748). However, he did not see his plan fully tested: he died, unmarried, on 12 May 1748, at Overton Manor. By his will he left the estate at Overton, bought from his elder brother's daughter, and all his other property in Cheshire to found a chair of astronomy in Cambridge University, the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry. The first professor, Roger Long, was appointed in 1750.<br>
