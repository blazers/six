<span class="headword">Sigurd (II) Hl&ouml;dvisson</span> <span class="st"> [Sigur&eth;r Hl&ouml;&eth;visson, Sigurd Digri, Sigur&eth;r inn Digri]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1014), <span class="occ">earl of Orkney</span>, is called Digri (&#145;the Stout&#146;) in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> (composed <i>c</i>.1200). The same epithet is given to King &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson (St Olaf), and carries the connotation of &#145;powerful warrior&#146;. The genealogy of the earls of Orkney, compiled <i>c</i>.1420, describes him as &#145;robustus ac corpolentis, magnus et strenuissimus bellifer&#146; (in the Scots translation &#145;the wicht and corpolent, ane grete and maist stowt battellare&#146;). He was remembered as &#145;a great chieftain [who] ruled over several dominions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 11), although he was not counted among the three most powerful earls (Sigurd (I), Thorfinn (II), and Harald Maddadson).<br>
<br>Son of Earl Hl&ouml;dver and of Eithne, daughter of King Kjarval (Cerball) of Osraige in Ireland, Sigurd had interests in the west, and is said to have gone on viking expeditions every summer, &#145;plundering in the Hebrides, Scotland and Ireland&#146;. He eventually met his death striving to win power in the Norse kingdom of Dublin. Initially he was concerned to establish earldom authority over the north mainland of Scotland, which had been hard to maintain since the conquests of Earl Sigurd inn Riki (Sigurd the Mighty) in the late ninth century. He was challenged by a Scottish &#145;earl&#146; called Finnleik (Finnlaech) to fight at Skitten Mire in Caithness, where his uncle Earl Liot Thorfinsson had fought a battle previously (there is a possibility that this is a mistaken reference to the earlier battle). Already at this date the earl had to persuade the Orkney farmers to support his campaign in Caithness, and did so by &#145;giving them back their land-rights&#146;. This is a very interesting reference to the evident disagreement between earls and farmers over the status of their lands. It was believed that even in the time of Einarr (Torf-Einarr) in the early tenth century the farmers had lost their udal right over their lands to the earl. Their success in winning it back from Sigurd indicates the power of the farmers to bargain when the earl requested military service outside the island earldom. There is no reason to doubt that the status of their lands was a point of dispute with the earl, although whether the information that it was negotiated over in this way can be relied on, is unprovable.<br>
<br>Sigurd was successful in his campaigns on the north Scottish mainland, remembered as being &#145;powerful enough to defend Caithness against the Scots&#146;, who at this date must have been the mormaers of Moray. Indeed, <span class="italic">Njals saga</span> claims that he also dominated &#145;Ross and Moray, Sutherland and the Dales&#146;, which suggests much wider-ranging conquests. The memory of his victory at Skitten Mire is bound up with the legends about his raven banner, woven for him by his mother, with magical properties that brought victory to the man before whom it was carried, but death to the man who carried it. At the battle of Skitten Mire the earl lost three standard-bearers, but none the less won the battle. Sigurd's ambitions clearly extended further south and west than Caithness and evidence for an alliance with Earl Gilli of Coll (recorded only in <span class="italic">Njals saga</span>), as well as the probable imposition of ounceland units in the Western Isles at this date, suggest that he exercised some control in this locality.<br>
<br>The information devoted to Sigurd in the main Icelandic text of <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> is surprisingly brief for such a famous warrior. There is in additional texts the well-known story of his forced conversion by &Oacute;l&aacute;f Tryggvason, who was returning to his homeland to claim the throne of Norway from his campaigns in England in 995, an incident much recounted in saga history. The two met at Osmundwall, in south Hoy, where Sigurd was taken aboard &Oacute;l&aacute;f's ship and baptized, handing over his son Hundi as a hostage. The saga's statement that &#145;all Orkney embraced the faith&#146; is probably overstated, although one version adds that priests were left behind in the islands by &Oacute;l&aacute;f. As Sigurd renounced his allegiance to &Oacute;l&aacute;f after his son Hundi died, his Christian allegiance may also have wavered. None the less the fact that he married the daughter of Malcolm, king of Scots (probably Malcolm II, who ruled from 1005 to 1034), means that he must have been considered an acceptable Christian ally by the established dynasty of the southern kingdom. This is the first recorded alliance of an earl with the Scots and it suggests that the earl and the king saw mutual advantages in being united against the dynasty of Moray established between them. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49271/', "Thorfinn (II) Sigurdson")</script> was the famous son of this alliance, younger than his three half-brothers Sumarlidi, Br&uacute;si, and Einarr, who must have resulted from one or more previous liaisons.<br>
<br>These three elder sons were left in charge of the earldom when Sigurd embarked on his last campaign in Ireland in 1014 (the date of 1005 is erroneously given in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>). This was in support of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25545/', "Sihtric Silkenbeard, king of Dublin")</script>, in his struggle with Brian B&oacute;ruma, king of Leinster, for continued control of eastern Ireland. Sigurd's ambitions (as recalled in <span class="italic">Njals saga</span>) included the hand of Sihtric's mother in matrimony and the kingship of Ireland. The battle of Clontarf is recorded in many different sources to supplement <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>'s meagre information. Passages in <span class="italic">Njals saga</span> describe scenes at Sigurd's Orkney residence before the earl left for Ireland, as well as fully recounting the drama of the battle action at Clontarf, just outside Dublin, on Good Friday (23 April) 1014, when the earl was forced to carry his bewitched raven banner, at the cost of his own life, and the collapse of his Irish ambitions. On this occasion the banner did not bring victory to the army before whom it was borne, and the result in several respects foretold the end of an era.<br>
