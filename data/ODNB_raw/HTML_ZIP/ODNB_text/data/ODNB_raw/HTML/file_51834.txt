<span class="headword">Dillon,  Agnes Joseph Madeline <span class="st"> [Una]</span></span>  (1903&#150;1993), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born on 8 January 1903 at 4 Westcroft Villas, Cricklewood, London, the third of the four daughters and fifth of the six children of Joseph Thomas Dillon, company secretary, and his wife, Teresa Joseph, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McNale, schoolteacher. Her younger sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74014/', "Carmen Dillon (1908&#150;2000)")</script>, film art director. Their parents defied Edwardian convention by ensuring that all their children, boys and girls, had a good education&#151;an expensive business. There was little money to spare, but the children were encouraged to be adventurous high achievers, and to &#145;plough their own furrow&#146;. After the older brother was killed in the First World War and the second left for India, followed by the oldest sister, who became a Carmelite nun, the three youngest Dillon children&#151;Tess, Una, as she was always called, and Carmen&#151;became the focus of their parents' ambition. Una, dazzled by Tess's first-class degree in physics, mistakenly followed her sister to Bedford College, London, but scraping through her science examinations &#145;by the skin of my teeth&#146;  (Grove) convinced her that she was no academic. She accepted a post with the Central Association for Mental Welfare (later MIND); she was soon organizing successful bookstalls on its behalf, and found herself drawn to the pleasurable world of publishing and publishers. Convinced that she had found her niche she left her job, determined to buy a Bloomsbury bookshop, 9 Store Street. Unfortunately the owner, Ronald Burns, did not wish to sell. A year later her persistence paid off and Burns accepted her offer of &pound;800. Now in her middle thirties, with no retail experience, and with loans of &pound;600 from her father and &pound;200 from a friend, Dillon found herself the owner of a run-down bookshop with little stock and few customers.<br>
<br>Dillon quickly established herself as a formidable businesswoman, becoming a familiar sight flying round London on an old bicycle&#151;a tweed-suited Valkyrie determined to fulfil a customer's order within eight hours. Her philosophy, that &#145;trade follows the book&#146;  (<span class="italic">Independent</span>), proved sound, as did her insistence on stocking academic books alongside general subjects. She disliked specialization, believing that it stifled curiosity. Her instinct, as always, was impeccable. The small shop proved a magnet for bibliophiles and writers such as C. Day Lewis and the poet John Betjeman, who became friends as well as customers.<br>
<br>In 1939 Dillon ignored advice to close her business. The total evacuation of London University and Froebel Training College was, like her bomb-shattered shop, seen as no more than a slight inconvenience. Hundreds of packing-cases were used to transport books to customers who had moved out to Cardiff, Leicester, and Knebworth House, while university library trolleys transferred her stock to an empty shop opposite in a seemingly never-ending wagon-train of books, old and new. Despite paper shortages and bombing raids, Dillon's Bookshop continued to serve the needs of London readers.<br>
<br>The war over, Dillon reached a watershed in her life. She needed to expand her business if it was to survive and if she was to emulate her sisters' success in their chosen fields; Tess was now head of physics at Queen Elizabeth College, London, and Carmen had left the Architectural Association to become one of Britain's first women film art directors. Una Dillon set her sights on the newly instituted teacher-training courses, and her shop soon became an educational Mecca for Commonwealth students. Further expansion seemed impossible when a proposed partnership, with London University, Dillon, and another bookseller, fell through; the row of shops in Torrington Place, next to Gower Street, acquired by the university after the war, remained tantalizingly empty. Then in 1956, quite unexpectedly, the principal of the university, Dillon's friend Sir Douglas Logan, urged the university to approach Dillon again. She used her stock and goodwill to purchase a minority share on the understanding that the shop bore her name. By the time she retired eleven years later, Dillon's University Bookshops Ltd had an annual turnover of over &pound;1 million and an enviable worldwide reputation.<br>
<br>Even in retirement Dillon's enthusiasm and commitment to the work of booksellers never waned. She remained on the board of Dillon's until 1977, when the university sold to Pentos. One of the founders of the Charter Group of the Booksellers' Association, she campaigned to keep the &#145;protective&#146; net book agreement, and assisted the British Council with the low-priced book scheme for British overseas books. A Roman Catholic, art lover, inveterate traveller, and gifted musician, for many years she was organist at St James's, Spanish Place. She was awarded an honorary MA in 1965 by London University, and three years later was appointed CBE for her services to bookselling. Although remarkably sanguine about her achievements, she found comparisons with Miss Christina Foyle, who &#145;inherited&#146; her empire, odious. She also loathed the modern title Ms, which seemed to encapsulate for her an alien and impersonal London far removed from the halcyon days of childhood and pre-war Britain.<br>
<br>None of the sisters married, and in 1985 Una and Carmen Dillon left their Kensington High Street mansion flat, after forty-four years, for a Victorian villa and the respectability of Hove; they were preceded by twenty packing-cases of books. Una Dillon died at the Victoria Nursing Home, 96 The Drive, Hove, Sussex, on 4 April 1993, of generalized atherosclerosis and terminal bronchopneumonia; her body was cremated. Her sister Carmen survived her.<br>
