<span class="headword">Wewitzer,  Ralph</span>  (1748&#150;1825), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Salisbury Street, off the Strand, London, on 17 December 1748, probably the eldest of the five children of Peter and Ann Wewitzer known to have acted in London in the late eighteenth century. According to the <span class="italic">Hibernian Magazine</span> (January 1775) their father was Norwegian, though alternative and likelier accounts suggest that he was Swiss.<br>
<br>Russell claimed that Ralph Wewitzer was apprenticed to, and briefly practised as, a jeweller before making his theatrical d&eacute;but at Covent Garden as Ralph in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span> on 12 May 1773. The occasion was the benefit of his younger sister <a href="#cosubject_29150">Sarah [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and his success was sufficient to determine his future career. It has been suggested, but cannot be confirmed, that he spent the 1773&#150;4 season acting in Dublin, either to evade or to earn sufficient to pay off his creditors, but he was with the company at Covent Garden from 1774 to 1789 and a regular summer performer at the Haymarket after 1780. In terms of the theatrical categories of his age, Wewitzer was a low comedian who specialized in the roles of foreigners&#151;French, Jewish, Spanish, Dutch, or German. John O'Keeffe generously acknowledged his contribution to the success of his musical spectacular <span class="italic">Omai</span> (Covent Garden, 1785), in which, as a South Sea warrior addressing Captain Cook, he:<blockquote>came out with a kind of grand extempore declaration, as if it was the original language of some of the islands: this had a sham English translation, which was printed in the book of the songs. Wewitzer did this piece of state harangue-pomposo wonderfully well. (O'Keeffe, 2.115)</blockquote>It was in another piece by O'Keeffe, <span class="italic">The Young Quaker</span> (1783), that Wewitzer created his most celebrated character, Shadrach the Jew, whose enduring popularity was matched only by his Doctor Caius in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. He was able to exploit the vogue for lampooning foreigners that was the theatrical reaction to Britain's burgeoning interests overseas, not least because he was himself a speaker and reader of French during the Napoleonic era.<br>
<br>Wewitzer cherished entrepreneurial and literary ambitions almost throughout his long career on the stage, but may well have lost more money than he gained by them. His brief management in 1790 of the Royalty Theatre, Wellclose Square, was unsuccessful, and a scheme to set up business as a fishmonger came to nothing. Three forgotten pantomimes have been ascribed to him, as well as a genealogical <span class="italic">Pedigree of King George III</span> (1812), a scantily researched reference work called <span class="italic">A Theatrical Pocket Book</span> (1814), and two posthumously published volumes of anecdotal history, <span class="italic">Green Room Gossip</span> (<i>c</i>.1826) and <span class="italic">Dramatic Reminiscences</span> (<i>c</i>.1855). He may, for a while, have acted as financial adviser to the actress Harriet Mellon, by then the widowed duchess of St Albans, but, given her charitable history, it is unlikely, if his advice had been useful, that she would have done nothing to alleviate the poverty of his last years. James Boaden cites the plight of &#145;poor Wewitzer&#146; in mounting an argument for the establishment of a retirement home for decayed actors  (Boaden, 342&#150;3).<br>
<br>Although the details are obscure, Wewitzer seems to have married twice, first at St Peter's, Church Street, Liverpool, to Mary Daniels on 14 September 1776 (who is known to have been still alive in 1783 and with whom he had one daughter) and second to a Miss Brangin, also of Covent Garden Theatre, on 23 December 1787; but at the time of his death, on 1 January 1825, he was living alone, &#145;under circumstances of peculiar distress&#146;  (Russell, 212), in Wild Passage, off Drury Lane. He was buried in Finsbury. He had for several years been dependent on an annual stipend of &pound;65 from the Theatrical Fund of Drury Lane, the theatre with which he had been predominantly associated since 1791.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_29150"></a><span class="headword">Sarah Wewitzer</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1756, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 18 July 1756, was the sister of Ralph Wewitzer. She may already have appeared as a singer in London's pleasure gardens before making her theatrical d&eacute;but at Covent Garden on 4 November 1772. Her voice and personality were ideally suited to the musical romances of Isaac Bickerstaff, and most of her early successes were in his work: <span class="italic">Daphne and Amintor</span> (1772), <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span> (1773), and <span class="italic">The Padlock</span> (1773). It was either she or an elder sister who sang with the operatic bass Frederick Reinhold at Marylebone Gardens in the summer of 1774, and it was certainly she who fluttered the hearts of young Dubliners by her appearances at the Smock Alley Theatre during the 1774&#150;5 season. An attractively engraved portrait was featured in the <span class="italic">Hibernian Magazine</span> of January 1775, capturing her as Rosetta in Bickerstaffe's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span> in the act of delivering the song &#145;Cease, gay deceivers&#146;, which she had made the rage of Dublin. Her reputation for virtue further piqued the interest of the city's bachelors&#151;and not only the bachelors. Sarah Wewitzer had made Dublin her home by the time she entered into an adulterous relationship with James Cuffe, member of parliament for co. Mayo. Cuffe's wife had been granted a legal separation not long after their marriage in 1778, and Wewitzer left the stage to set up home with him and bear his children. Cuffe was created Baron Tyrawley of Ballinrobe in 1797, and when his wife died in 1808 Wewitzer adopted the name of Lady Tyrawley. There is no record of a marriage and neither of their sons, James Cuffe, MP for co. Mayo, or Henry Cuffe, succeeded to the peerage. It may be that the couple had separated before Wewitzer's death, at Ballinrobe on 4 October 1820. According to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society for the Preservation of Memorials in Ireland</span>  (vol. 7, p. 152), she was buried at Ballinrobe as Lady Tyrawley.<br>
