<span class="headword">Green,  (James) Maurice Spurgeon</span>  (1906&#150;1987), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Padiham in Lancashire on 8 December 1906, one of the two sons of Lieutenant-Colonel James Edward Green, and his wife, Constance Ingraham-Johnson. He was educated at Rugby School where he was a scholar and at University College, Oxford, where he won a double first-class degree in Greats and was counted among the most brilliant of his generation.<br>
<br>Brendan Bracken, who had a sharp eye for able young men, gave him his first job on the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>. Green quickly made his mark, first on market reports and then as a leader writer. He was among the small group of young men in the 1930s who helped to lay the foundations of modern financial journalism. At the age of only twenty-eight he became editor and stayed in that post for five years. Together with Otto Clarke, his chief leader writer and head of the &#145;Lex&#146; column, he devised the Financial News 30-share index which eventually became the Financial Times ordinary share index. He married first, on 15 January 1930, Pearl Oko of Cincinnati, Ohio, who died in 1934. On 14 October 1936 he married Janet Grace Norie, daughter of Major-General C. E. M. Norie. They had two sons. Green moved to <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1938 and had a year there as financial and industrial editor before the Second World War broke out. Green had joined the Territorial Army and for the next five years served with the Royal Artillery, finishing his military career as a major on the staff of the 3rd anti-aircraft group at Bristol. He was made an MBE (military) for his wartime service.<br>
<br>Reckoned to be too old to serve overseas, Green was released from the army in 1944 and rejoined <span class="italic">The Times</span>, where his value was seen to lie in judgement rather than drive. There he became assistant editor in 1953. After eighteen years with <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he moved to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> as deputy editor in 1961, and in 1964 was appointed editor there in succession to Sir Colin Coote. The period of his editorship, 1964&#150;74, was politically divided between six years of Harold Wilson and four years of Edward Heath. Both prime ministers were made to feel the weight of Green's economic philosophy and influence. Always more interested in economics than politics, he held firmly to the doctrine of the free market before it became more fashionable a decade later. Thus throughout Green's tenure as editor the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>'s leader writers were given the clearest economic guide posts. Many of the editorials were written by Green himself. His writing was exact rather than exciting. There was no embroidery. He applied the somewhat austere disciplines he imposed on the work of colleagues to all his own writing.<br>
<br>From 1971 onwards Green's relations with Edward Heath became increasingly strained, mainly because he profoundly disagreed with the prime minister's economic policy. Green's economic beliefs led him to see virtue in the line being taken by Margaret Thatcher and her friends, and he was among her early supporters. He encouraged her to stand for the Tory leadership when her chances of gaining it looked slim.<br>
<br>As an editor Green was admired and respected for his intellect, but he also exercised a gentle, persuasive art of his own. With his slightly donnish stoop, he would approach his specialists for guidance with endearing modesty. Rooted in clear principles, particularly in the economic sphere, he did not have to raise his voice to make his point. At the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> 135 Fleet Street specialists and leader writers worked in separate rooms. Green rarely summoned anyone to his room; he preferred to visit them in theirs. Economics apart, Green's editorial policies were generously described by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;marked by civilised, humane ideals&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 July 1987). It was an apt comment. His apparent air of detachment concealed a firm hold on the principles by which he felt the affairs of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> should be conducted. He often thought for what seemed an unnervingly long interval before giving his answer to some question or request. But when it arrived, the answer was usually hard to gainsay.<br>
<br>For some years after he retired as editor, Green remained a contributor to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> on economic subjects. He attended the annual budget statement and would turn out a long leader on the subject within ninety minutes of returning to the office. In 1976&#150;7 he was president of the Institute of Journalists. It was a time when trade unions exercised considerable power in Fleet Street, as they had done throughout his tenure as editor. Strenuously opposed to the single-union closed shop, Green used his position to utter repeated warnings to his profession against its dangers. His interests and his recreations lay in many fields. Foremost among them was fly fishing which he practised principally on the River Itchen. He was a keen shot. When the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> was founded in 1961, Green, then deputy editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, asked not to be considered because it would deprive him of Saturday shooting. He played the piano, collected porcelain and watercolours, won a half-blue at Oxford for chess, and was an authority on wine. Early in his life he was an enthusiastic collector of wild fungus. In the early post-war years he went on bicycling tours of Europe with his wife. Green died on 19 July 1987 at Winchester, Hampshire.<br>
