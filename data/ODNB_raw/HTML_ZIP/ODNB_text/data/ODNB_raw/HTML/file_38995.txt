<span class="headword">Eno,  James Crossley</span>  (1827/8&#150;1915), <span class="occ">manufacturer of patent medicine</span>, was born in Newcastle, the son of James Eno (<i>c</i>.1793&#150;1829), a general shopkeeper, and his wife, Elizabeth (1792/3&#150;1874), daughter of John Jackson. After leaving school, he was apprenticed to a Newcastle retail chemist, and in 1846 became a dispenser at the infirmary there at &pound;60 a year. In his spare time, he practised as a dentist. In 1852 he was able to buy a local chemist's business. He continued his dentistry work and sold some of his own products, among them a hair restorer. That year on 20 June he married Elizabeth Ann (<i>d</i>. 1907), daughter of John Edward Cooke, gardener, of Winlaton, co. Durham. They had two daughters and also a son, Crossley, who died of typhoid before reaching adulthood.<br>
<br>Eno was one of several Newcastle chemists, such as Joseph Wilson Swan, who at that time were striving to break out of the dull dispensing routine. Using a by-product of the area's burgeoning alkali industry, he began, probably in the late 1850s, to make a saline preparation comprising a mixture of tartaric and citric acid with sodium bicarbonate, which created an effervescent drink when water was added. As this proved a palatable remedy for hangovers and digestive troubles, Eno advertised it by giving free samples to the captains of vessels in Newcastle docks. Consequently overseas sales soon outstripped those at home, the ranks of dyspeptic seafaring customers being joined by British expatriates, especially in the tropics. As Eno's advertisements constantly stressed, excessive drinking could lead only to biliousness and attacks of dysentery; while advocating moderation in food and drink, plentiful exercise, and so on, he urged the use of his preparation to help secrete healthy bile and hence purify the blood.<br>
<br>In the early 1870s demand began to soar. According to his own testimony, Eno invented the title of Eno's Fruit Salt in 1873; it was later registered under the <span class="roman">Trade Marks Registration Act</span> of 1875, but it was never patented, as he was wont to claim. When his elder daughter married in 1874, her husband, John Nicholson Fleming MD (<i>d</i>. 1889), joined the firm as manager. That year Eno published a puffing <span class="italic">Treatise on the Stomach and its Trials</span>. In 1876 the firm was transferred to London, where a factory was opened at New Cross. Eno acquired Wood Hall, a mansion with large grounds, in nearby Dulwich.<br>
<br>Eno sold only to wholesalers, in quantities not under a gross, charged them outward carriage, and required cash with orders. The firm grew on a tide of change in tastes among digestive sufferers. Although sales of old-fashioned pills, such as those of Thomas Beecham, remained buoyant, demand was mounting for remedies that were more palatable. Eno exploited the trend with plentiful advertising, on which he was spending between &pound;14,000 and &pound;16,000 annually by the early 1890s; in 1914 profits were &pound;128,000 on &pound;260,000 turnover. So far from emulating the Beechams with catchy and amusing advertisements, he preferred to disseminate his views on many topics: in half-page spreads inserted in prestige weeklies such as the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> he would cram up to a thousand words, headed by barely penetrable aphorisms such as &#145;contemplation is the only lasting pleasure&#146;. At one stage he ran a campaign about the poor sanitary condition of Britain's inner cities.<br>
<br>While Eno's wordy offerings must have been the despair of his London advertising agents, Gordon and Gotch, few people were put off his rather agreeable product. With branches in Australia and South Africa, the agency doubtless helped to make the business truly international. At home, Eno's claim that the product was a fruit salt was challenged in several high-profile legal cases. After the second, in 1889, which was fought up to the House of Lords, the description &#145;fruit salt&#146; was struck from the register, not to be restored until an amending act of 1907.<br>
<br>In 1897 J. C. Eno was registered as a private limited company, with a capital of &pound;100,000 and Eno as governing director. He continued to take an active part until 1905, thereafter dividing his time between his home and the National Liberal Club. He was generous to his old infirmary in Newcastle, donating over &pound;10,000 in 1899 and a further &pound;40,000 in his will. He also left &pound;50,000 to Guy's Hospital, London. Tall and of singularly handsome appearance when young, in old age he kept his spare frame, with a shock of white hair and a white beard. He was afflicted with total deafness and was entirely indifferent to everything at his club except the newspapers; the club secretary could recall no member who had ever had the slightest contact with him. Eno died of pneumonia at his home, Wood Hall, College Road, Dulwich, on 11 May 1915 and was cremated at Golders Green four days later. A granddaughter was Dame Isobel Cripps, wife of Sir Stafford Cripps who wrote a legal opinion on how to retain exclusive rights to the words &#145;fruit salt&#146; by playing down the name of Eno; this remained a doctrine of the Eno company even after it was taken over by Beechams in 1938.<br>
