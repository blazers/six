<span class="headword">King,  William</span>  (1786&#150;1865), <span class="occ">physician and promoter of co-operative principles</span>, was born on 17 April 1786 at Ipswich, one of ten children of the Revd John King (1738&#150;1822) and his wife, Elizabeth Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bishop. King was educated at Ipswich grammar school, where his father had been master. Aged fifteen he entered Westminster School, subsequently going up to Peterhouse, Cambridge. He graduated BA in 1809 and MA in 1812. Originally intended for the church, King studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and in France, at Montpellier and Paris. He returned to Cambridge in 1817, graduating MD in 1819. In 1820 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. On 17 January 1821 he married Mary Hooker of Rottingdean, and the following December settled in Brighton.<br>
<br>King supported initiatives promoting working-class self-help and charitable organization in Brighton, associating with philanthropists including Elizabeth Fry and Lady Noel Byron. Educational interests led him to sponsor the establishment of a mechanics' institute in 1825. Speaking engagements at the institute initiated his involvement with co-operation. Many of the workmen who fostered co-operation locally, including their leader William Bryan, were institute members. 1827 saw the establishment of the Brighton Co-operative Benevolent Fund Association to amass capital in support of Owenite communitarianism, and an extension of fund-raising through the foundation of a co-operative trading association.<br>
<br>King's contribution to co-operation was educational, leaving a legacy of national importance. <span class="italic">The Co-Operator</span>, a monthly periodical started by him in May 1828, outlined the potential for societal transformation through the extension of co-operative activity from retailing to manufacture and self-employment, and eventual full community. Publication of such ideas in an intelligible form contributed greatly to the upsurge of co-operative society foundations in the late 1820s and early 1830s. However, King's willingness to publish advocacy of &eacute;lite patronage for co-operation and his unease about Owenite radicalism and anti-clericalism led to attacks on him in other co-operative journals. These contributed to his decision to cease publication in August 1830. Requests that he republish essays from <span class="italic">The Co-Operator</span>, and an invitation to the 1833 Co-operative Congress, were declined. He was aware, too, that advocacy of progressive causes, also including Catholic emancipation, was damaging his professional prospects.<br>
<br>King's subsequent career was chiefly of local significance. In 1842 he was elected physician to the Sussex County Hospital. He was also physician to the Brighton Provident Dispensary from 1849. As one of the commissioners responsible for urban government in Brighton, he played a leading role in the town's acquisition of the Royal Pavilion in 1850.<br>
<br>Although few copies of <span class="italic">The Co-Operator</span> survived, its advocacy of association was rediscovered by later co-operators, including the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in the 1840s. King's ideas anticipated aspects of Christian socialism, which itself sponsored co-operatives during the 1850s. King expressed support for such initiatives and maintained a continuing faith in co-operation's redemptive power. He retired as physician to the Sussex Hospital in 1861. In his latter years he suffered from a heart condition, which led to his death on 19 October 1865, at his home, 23 Montpelier Road, Brighton. He was buried in Hove parish church on 25 October. King was survived by his wife and at least two children, a daughter, Catherine, and a son, George.<br>
