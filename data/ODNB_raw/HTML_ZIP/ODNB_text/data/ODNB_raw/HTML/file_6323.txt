<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cornelys <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Imer; <em>married name </em>Pompeati]</span>,  (Anna Maria) Teresa</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Madame Trenti, Mrs Smith]</span>  (1723?&#150;1797), <span class="occ">singer and impresario</span>, was born in Venice, probably in 1723, to the Genoan actor and impresario Giuseppe Imer (<i>d</i>. 1758) and his wife. Many particulars of her life, especially before 1759, derive from Giacomo Casanova's <span class="italic">History of my Life</span>, a not wholly reliable source. Teresa and her older sister Marianna were trained as professional singers. Casanova (1725&#150;1798) met Teresa for the first of several times about 1740 and says that being caught making love to her cost him a job. The outlines of her moderately successful career between 1741 and 1754, mostly as a <i>seconda donna</i>, can be traced through casts printed in opera librettos, though she almost certainly sang in other productions for which no book was printed. She is listed as Cleopatra in the libretto for the 1741 production of <span class="italic">Cesare in Egitto</span> in Verona, her earliest known performance. She sang Vitellia in <span class="italic">Tito Manlio</span> during the carnival season at Florence in 1742 in a company that included her sister. In Venice on 2 May 1742 she appeared as Barsene in the premi&egrave;re of Gluck's <span class="italic">Demetrio</span>. In 1743 she sang Creusa in <span class="italic">Demofoonte</span> in Padua as well as Albina in <span class="italic">Alessandro Severo</span> and Araspe in <span class="italic">Farasmane re di Tracia</span> at Genoa, both with her sister. The Sartori index lists her as Dircea in <span class="italic">Demofoonte</span> in Turin in 1744, but the entry for the libretto is lacking.<br>
<br>At an unknown date about 1744&#150;5 Teresa married the dancer Angelo Francesco Pompeati (<i>c</i>.1701&#150;1768), with whom she had a son, Giuseppe (1746&#150;<i>c</i>.1797). The sisters sang at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, in London during the 1745&#150;6 season, when Gluck was the house composer. Teresa created the role of Iride in <span class="italic">La caduta de giganti</span>, sang Erifile in <span class="italic">Il trionfo della continenza</span>, an unknown role in <span class="italic">Artamene</span>, and Erissena in <span class="italic">Alessandro nell'Indie</span>. After this season the sisters' careers diverged, and there is a small gap in documentation of Teresa's engagements. In 1748 she went to Hamburg to sing Rosmiri in <span class="italic">Arsace</span> and Irene in <span class="italic">Bajazet</span>. According to Howard, she probably participated in the premi&egrave;re of Gluck's <span class="italic">La contesa de'numi</span> in Copenhagen in 1749, and the next year she sang Aristea in <span class="italic">L'Olympiade</span> at Brunswick.<br>
<br>Then there is a blank in Teresa's career. Aspects of her life can be sketched in from Casanova, who, while acknowledging her intelligence, asserts that &#145;her good fortune had not depended entirely on her talent; her charms had contributed to it more than anything else&#146;  (Casanova, 3.243&#150;4). The first instance he offers is that she became the mistress of Friedrich, margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth (1711&#150;1763). In February 1753 she bore a daughter, baptized Wilhelmine Frederike. The child's paternity is uncertain, as is the total number of Teresa's children. About this time she and her husband separated permanently, and Casanova reports that she had begun an affair with a gentleman of the bedchamber, Th&eacute;odore Camille, marquis de Montperny. Casanova admits to a very brief liaison he himself had with Teresa during a visit she made to Venice in 1753, and he eventually acknowledged paternity of a daughter known in London as Sophie Wilhelmina, who was Teresa's second or perhaps third child.<br>
<br>After resuming her career, Teresa appeared in 1754 as Animia in <span class="italic">L'huomo</span> at Bayreuth and as Asteria in <span class="italic">Bajazet</span> in Turin, where she placed her maiden name after that of her estranged husband and described herself as &#145;virtuosa di camera delle Loro Altezze Eccellenze e Reali di Barayt&#146;  (Sartori, 3.643). Casanova says that at an unknown date, presumably after this, the discovery of her affair with Montperny ended her tenure as the margrave's mistress. Casanova records what he says is the history she gave him of her next several years: she had &#145;gone to Brussels with a lover, where for a few days she had taken the fancy of Prince Charles of Lorraine, who gave her a special patent granting her the direction of all theatrical performances throughout the Austrian Netherlands&#146;  (Casanova, 5.138). Prince Karl Alexander of Lorraine was governor of the Austrian Netherlands between 1748 and 1756, and a &#145;Mlle Pompeati&#146; was listed as &#145;directrice des spectacles en Flandre&#146; among the subscribers to Robert Daubat's <span class="italic">Cent contre-danses</span> (1757), but otherwise this part of her life is obscure. According to Casanova,<blockquote>with this patent she had embarked on the most extensive enterprises which had led her to spend enormous sums, so that in less than three years, after selling all her diamonds, her laces, her wardrobe, and everything she owned, she had been obliged to go to Holland to avoid being sent to prison. (Casanova, 5.138)</blockquote>Casanova says he heard this story when he came across Teresa unexpectedly in 1758&#150;9 in Amsterdam, where she was singing at public concerts around a circuit of Dutch cities in very reduced circumstances under the name Madame Trenti. He was no longer interested in her sexual favours but professed concern for the child Sophie, who was introduced to him as his own. He therefore agreed to give Teresa money with which to move to Britain, where she thought she could make a better living, and he temporarily took charge of her son Giuseppe.<br>
<br>Teresa arrived in London in October 1759. She travelled with further financial help from another lover, the Dutch merchant Jan Cornelis Rigerboos (or Jan Rigerboos Cornelis), whose name she used during most of the rest of her life. No particulars about their relationship are known, though late in his memoirs Casanova alleges that she &#145;ruined&#146; Rigerboos  (Casanova, 9.162). Teresa chose London for a new beginning because she thought she had an entr&eacute;e to musical circles through a cellist and double-bass player performing in the Dutch concerts. He called himself John Freeman and claimed to be a beneficed clergyman in the Church of England with many contacts who would be useful in her attempt to support herself via concerts in London  (<span class="roman">Survey of London</span>, 33.74). There he used the name John Fermor (he appears as &#145;Sir Frederick Fermer&#146; in Casanova, 9.163&#150;4), and although he proved not to have the contacts needed, he did have money to lend.<br>
<br>In a lawsuit Teresa noted that together they gave a series of concerts at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket shortly after their arrival in October 1759. She worked hard at meeting potential aristocratic patrons for an ambitious scheme of subscription assemblies that she and Fermor had worked up together. As she did not yet speak English and was not in a position to be too choosy about her supporters, at the beginning she used the notorious Elizabeth Chudleigh as a spokesperson for the project, but other (at least slightly) more respectable ladies soon endorsed her plans. Horace Walpole names Elizabeth Percy, countess of Northumberland, Caroline Stanhope, countess of Harrington, and &#145;some other great ladies&#146; (whom he disliked) as her eventual sponsors  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 23.271).<br>
<br>Teresa leased Carlisle House, Soho Square, in May 1760 and began her &#145;entertainments&#146; that autumn. The key to her success was limiting the subscription to the nobility and people vouched for by them. Aristocrats bought 5 guinea tickets to a series of gatherings to which only members of &#145;the Society&#146; were admitted. Dancing and refreshments were available, but probably a more potent lure was gambling. Few records of the early meetings remain. A highly irregular pattern of advertising suggests that Teresa communicated with her subscribers principally by private means. Tickets were never available for sale to the general public, nor were her assemblies usually reviewed, as more public gatherings sometimes were. Encouraged by her success, she commissioned a major remodelling of the premises, between June and December 1761. To settle construction debts she gave large numbers of tickets, or the promise of the income from them, to certain creditors.<br>
<br>During the 1760s Teresa undertook several kinds of expansion. She engaged the best musicians available in London, and the Johann Christian Bach&#150;Karl Friedrich Abel concert series began at Carlisle House in 1763&#150;4; when it transferred in 1767&#150;8 to her competitor, Almack's Rooms, she turned to Felice Giardini and Mattia Vento for music. She branched out to include concerts, balls, and masquerades among her &#145;entertainments&#146;, and boldly sang in oratorios in 1764 and 1765. A plan to open a parallel set of rooms in the City was bruited in 1766, but not well received. Further development of the Carlisle House property in 1768 included costly rooms with a Chinese motif and a Chinese bridge between buildings, probably designed by the cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale. Teresa's balls and masquerades were increasingly both splendid and (perhaps undeservedly) notorious for loose conduct.<br>
<br>Writing to Horace Mann on 22 February 1771, Horace Walpole summarized her progress in retrospect:<blockquote>She took Carlisle House in Soho Square, enlarged it and established assemblies and balls by subscription. At first they scandalized, but soon drew in both righteous and ungodly. She went on building, and made her house a fairy palace, for balls, concerts and masquerades.</blockquote>While he regarded &#145;her taste and invention in pleasures and decorations&#146; as &#145;singular&#146;, he also acknowledged that &#145;of late years she has been the Heidegger of the age, and presided over our diversions&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 23.271).<br>
<br>Teresa's success was, financially at least, superficial. She was never able to accumulate capital or pay off her debts, so from as early as February 1762 she was constantly harassed by creditors' lawsuits. Casanova, visiting London in 1763&#150;4, found her confined to the house except on Sundays, lest bailiffs arrest her. On 1 February 1768 she signed an agreement with four creditors that left her with only nominal control of the entertainments and an &pound;800 expense budget, for a business that was valued at &pound;20,000  (TNA: PRO, C12/1518/6). Still borrowing and finagling, in 1771 she took advantage of disagreements between the administration of the King's Theatre, Haymarket, and its imported stars, particularly Gaetano Guadagni, to expand into opera. Under the disguise of &#145;harmonic meetings&#146; she, Guadagni, and the dancer Simon Slingsby presented fully costumed and at least semi-staged <i>opera seria</i> at Carlisle House. Performances of Vento's <span class="italic">Artaserse</span> on 24 and 31 January 1771 brought complaints from the opera managers at the Bow Street magistrates' court that they were violating the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> of 1737. The theatre managers supported these complaints, since their monopoly too would have been vulnerable, had this scheme succeeded. She was twice fined &pound;50, but the rumour of a prosecution for running a bawdy house is not true. Several satirical pictures of Teresa were published about this time.<br>
<br>According to lawsuit testimony, Teresa cleared more than &pound;3000 in 1771, though only &pound;1300 by 28 October 1772  (TNA: PRO, C12/1518/6). The failure of her opera brought out creditors, and by October she had gone into retirement at &#145;The Hotel&#146; in Southwark, in which she briefly had a part interest. The list of bankrupts in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of November 1772 described her as a &#145;dealer&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 42, 1772, 544). On 22 December Carlisle House and its furnishings were sold to a consortium of her creditors (among them Chippendale) for &pound;10,200 in what she claimed was a rigged auction. Her daughter deserted her at this time and lived on the charity of various noble families for the rest of her life. Teresa was granted a &pound;200 annuity after the auction, though how long it was paid is not clear. However, Carlisle House did not flourish after her demotion: she was unable to regain her public in the few masquerades to which her name was attached in the next five years.<br>
<br>Teresa &#145;remained in obscurity many years&#146; under the alias Mrs Smith, according to her obituary  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 67/2, 1797, 890). She had recently reappeared, to the amusement of that writer, keeping a herd of asses in Knightsbridge, whose milk she occasionally offered as a &#145;public <i>d&eacute;jeun&eacute;</i> for people of fashion&#146;  (ibid.). Again she managed to overspend: an allowance made her by her son, who was tutor to George Fermor, third earl of Pomfret, and the annuity provided by a member of the Cowper family were not enough to keep her out of the Fleet prison, where she died on 19 August 1797, still full of &#145;visionary projects&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 67/2, 1797, 891). The generous assessment in the obituary seems remarkably apt: she was &#145;a distinguished priestess of fashion&#146;  (ibid., 890), who &#145;being of an enterprizing spirit, possessing a good understanding, great knowledge of mankind, and specious manners&#146;  (ibid.), was able to make Carlisle House &#145;the favourite region of amusement among the nobility and gentry&#146;  (ibid.) for more than ten years; she provided such &#145;diversified amusement&#146;  (ibid.) that for many years &#145;no other public entertainments could pretend to rival&#146;  (ibid.) Carlisle House. Despite her fall, her &#145;<i>projecting turn</i>&#146;  (ibid., 891) kept her dreaming that she might recapture her position at the height of society. A female entrepreneur who could not control her expansionist tendencies, for more than a decade she directed fashionable entertainments for the British nobility, despite being a foreign adventuress and stage performer.<br>
