<span class="headword">Stobart,  Mabel Annie  St Clair</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mabel Annie Boulton; <em>other married name </em>Mabel Annie  Stobart Greenhalgh]</span>  (1862&#150;1954), <span class="occ">medical relief worker and writer</span>, was born at 37 Wood Street, Woolwich, on 3 February 1862, the third daughter of Sir Samuel Bagster Boulton, first baronet (1830&#150;1918), merchant and contractor, and his wife, Sophia Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1900). Her childhood was largely spent at Charlton in Hertfordshire with five sisters and two brothers. Auguring a life that was to be unusually independent and active, she refused to attend school (she was educated by governesses) or to be presented at court. On 16 July 1884 she married St Clair Kelburn Mulholland Stobart (<i>d</i>. 1908) of Mount Bagnal, Ireland, with whom she had two sons; for seven years the Stobarts lived in Cornwall, then moved to London, and finally, after financial reverses, to the Transvaal to farm in 1903. In 1907 she returned to England and was widowed the following year. On 11 March 1911 she married John Herbert Greenhalgh (<i>d</i>. 1928), a retired barrister and colonial service judge, but continued to be known professionally as Mabel Annie St Clair Stobart.<br>
<br>Early in her first marriage Mrs Stobart had published some articles about fishing and a small book on golf as a county champion golfer. In 1907, for a more ambitious article in the <span class="italic">Catholic Times</span> and in <span class="italic">Catholic Opinion</span> of 20 December, she went to Brussels to interview important politicians to support her contention that Britain was claiming Belgian misrule in the Congo as an excuse to annex the territory. An ardent feminist, who believed in the potential wartime usefulness of women and that the reward of proving their national worthiness would be enfranchisement, she also began the Women's Sick and Wounded Convoy Corps in 1907 to serve between field and base hospitals, using a training programme based on Royal Army Medical Corps methods. Although the British Red Cross refused the corps's services in the First Balkan War in 1912, by enlisting the aid of Queen Eleonora of the Bulgarians, Stobart enabled an all-woman unit led by herself to set up a hospital at Kirk-Kilisse in Thrace for the Bulgarian Red Cross; she recorded its experiences in <span class="italic">War and Women</span> (1913). Despite having participated in an anti-war rally on 4 August 1914, she also founded the Women's National Service League to provide wartime service at home or abroad. At the invitation of the Belgian Red Cross she arrived in Brussels to set up a hospital, but before her unit could join her Brussels had fallen, and she was arrested in Louvain and condemned as a spy, though subsequently released. On 22 September she brought another National Service League unit to organize a hospital in Antwerp; when Antwerp had to be abandoned, with yet another group she set up a hospital at Ch&acirc;teau Tourlaville, near Cherbourg, for the St John Ambulance Association, finally with the approval of the hitherto scoffing British Red Cross. Ever indefatigable and resourceful, and with that hospital functioning smoothly, in 1915 she redirected her energies to Serbia, and for the Serbian Relief Fund, with still another group, set up an innovative tented hospital and a chain of emergency dispensaries to which thousands of civilians came for help. When the Serbian Army Medical Services sent a group under her command to the front as a mobile hospital unit, riding ponyback she led a column for eighty-one days of the gruelling Serbian retreat, the only column to arrive at Scutari in Albania on 20 December 1915 without any losses or desertions. For her services she was decorated with the Serbian orders of the White Eagle and of St Sava and by the Bulgarian Red Cross. On 7 June 1916 she was appointed a lady of grace of the order of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England. In 1916 she also published <span class="italic">The Flaming Sword in Serbia and Elsewhere</span>, illustrated with her own photographs, and undertook British lecture tours, the proceeds of which she contributed to the Serbian Red Cross. For the Ministry of Information in October 1917 &#150; May 1918 she lectured in Canada and the United States, and from September to November in Ireland. In 1918 she was awarded custody of her two granddaughters whose parents had died in the influenza epidemic; in 1928 she would suffer the double loss of her elder son and her husband.<br>
<br>Reared an Anglican but later converted to spiritualism, Mabel became chair of the British College of Psychic Science and inaugurated and led the Spiritualist Community, serving as chair of its council in 1924&#150;41, besides joining the council of the World Congress of Faiths. Books such as <span class="italic">The Torchbearers of Spiritualism</span> (1925), describing the witnesses of God who became great teachers because of their psychic faculties, attested to her faith. In 1929 she helped found and became vice-chair of the SOS Society to provide hostels for the unemployed. In 1935 she published her autobiography, <span class="italic">Miracles and Adventures</span>. She died on 7 December 1954 at the Cavendish Nursing Home, Braidley Road, Bournemouth.<br>
