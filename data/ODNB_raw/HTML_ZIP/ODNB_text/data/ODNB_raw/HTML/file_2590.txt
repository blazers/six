<span class="headword">Blakeney,  Richard Paul</span>  (1820&#150;1884), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in co. Roscommon on 2 June 1820, the son of Richard Blakeney, a Royal Marines officer, and his wife, Susan Maria, elder daughter of John Purdon of Low Park, co. Roscommon. His father's family came originally from Norfolk. He was educated at Mr Sargent's school in Dublin and at Trinity College, Dublin, where he matriculated in 1837, graduated BA in 1842, and took his LLB and LLD in 1852. He was awarded a DD by the University of Edinburgh in 1868.<br>
<br>Blakeney was ordained deacon in 1843 and priest in 1844. His first curacy was at St Paul's, Nottingham, and in 1844 he was appointed perpetual curate of the new district church of Hyson Green, Nottingham. He became involved in local controversies with Roman Catholics, and rapidly acquired a reputation as a protestant polemicist through his involvement in the British Reformation Society. From late 1850 he was employed by John Hope (1807&#150;1893), the barrister and philanthropist, to write tracts for his Edinburgh-based anti-Catholic movement. These works formed the basis of Blakeney's <span class="italic">Manual of the Romish Controversy</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">Popery in its Social Aspect</span> (1852).<br>
<br>Blakeney had married first about 1840, but his wife, Anna, was, he subsequently alleged, &#145;torn from me by the demoniacal machinations of Popery for ten years&#146;  (Blakeney to J. Hope, 24 May 1851, NA Scot., Hope MSS). In May 1851 Blakeney's brother carried her off from alleged confinement at Gort in co. Galway and returned her to her husband, who found her to be in a mentally and physically enfeebled state. It would seem that this personal tragedy gave particular intensity to Blakeney's hatred of the Roman Catholic church. Anna Blakeney appears to have died in 1855.<br>
<br>In 1852 Blakeney moved to Birkenhead, as perpetual curate of Christ Church, Claughton. During the subsequent two decades he combined an energetic parochial ministry with national roles as a prominent organizer and writer on behalf of militantly protestant evangelicalism within the Church of England. He was a dominant force in the British Reformation Society, a key opponent of ritualism, and supporter of the Church Association, formed in 1865. His works, which also notably included a <span class="italic">Protestant Catechism</span> (1854) and <span class="italic">The Book of Common Prayer in its History and Interpretation</span> (1865), became textbooks for his party. In the meantime he was married a second time in 1856, to Elizabeth Bibby. They had four sons and six daughters, born between 1858 and 1874.<br>
<br>In 1874 Blakeney was appointed vicar of Bridlington, Yorkshire, where he adopted a gentle and effective pastoral style which belied his reputation as a formidable controversialist. He was instrumental in the restoration of Bridlington priory church, and his growing respectability was evidenced by his appointment as a rural dean in 1875 and as a canon of York Minster in 1882. He died at the parsonage in Bridlington on 31 December 1884, after a short illness, and was buried on 6 January 1885 in the shadow of the priory church. At a subsequent memorial meeting the archbishop of York, William Thomson, paid tribute to his unsurpassed learning and unfailing humility of demeanour. Blakeney's brother, John Edward Blakeney (1824&#150;1895), first archdeacon of Sheffield, shared his religious opinions, and won renown as a church builder and ecclesiastical administrator.<br>
