<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  William Erskine</span>  (1808&#150;1881), <span class="occ">army officer and engineer</span>, was the fourth son of Captain Joseph Baker RN, and was born on 29 November 1808 at Leith. He was educated at Ludlow and at Addiscombe College (1825&#150;6), and after attending an extended engineering course while a cadet he went out to India as a lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers in 1828. On 29 June 1837 he married, at Karnal, Frances Gertrude, third daughter of Major-General A. Duncan; she survived her husband.<br>
<br>Baker was promoted captain in 1840, and saw service in the First Anglo-Sikh War. He led one of the attacking columns to the entrenchments at the battle of Sobraon, for which he was thanked in the dispatch and promoted major. He was afterwards almost exclusively employed in the public works department, and was successively superintendent of the Delhi canals, superintendent of canals and forests in Sind, director of the Ganges Canal project, consulting engineer to the government of India for railways, and secretary to the government of India in the public works department. His services as a civil engineer were considerable, and he was widely regarded as the greatest authority of his time on irrigation. His military promotion continued during his civil employment, and he became lieutenant-colonel in 1854 and colonel in 1857.<br>
<br>In 1858 Baker returned to England, and was appointed military secretary to the India Office. But his expertise was rather that of an engineer than a soldier, and in 1861 he became a member of the Council of India, and as such was chief adviser to the home government on Indian civil engineering. He was promoted major-general in 1865, colonel-commandant of the Royal (formerly Bengal) Engineers in 1871, and lieutenant-general in 1874; he was made a KCB in 1870. Retiring from public life in 1875, he was appointed general in 1877, and died at his home at Castle Banwell, Somerset, on 16 December 1881. Sir William Erskine Baker's work in Sind was memorable; the great irrigation works which he carried out there remained as a monument to his energy and organizational skill.<br>
