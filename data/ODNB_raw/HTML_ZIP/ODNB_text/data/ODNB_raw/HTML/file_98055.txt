<span class="headword">Smith,  Edward Shrapnell  Shrapnell-</span>  (1875&#150;1952), <span class="occ">promoter of commercial road transport</span>, was born at 2 Cambridge Street, Liverpool, on 10 February 1875, the only son and second of the six children of Edward Charles Smith (<i>b</i>. 1840/41), wine merchant, and his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shrapnell (<i>b</i>. 1842/3). Though Shrapnell was originally his middle name, from an early age he styled himself Shrapnell Smith. In 1913 he changed his name by deed poll and was called thereafter Edward Shrapnell Shrapnell-Smith  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 Aug 1913).<br>
<br>Shrapnell-Smith was educated at Liverpool College (Modern School), Liverpool Royal Institution School and University College, Liverpool, where he studied chemistry. He served an apprenticeship at a chemical works in Widnes and for two years worked in the town as a chemist with Gaskell-Deacon &amp; Co., gaining a reputation as an able researcher. In 1899, while employed by the United Alkali Company in Liverpool, he and a colleague were the first investigators to obtain crystalline sodium hypochlorite (<span class="italic">WWW</span>; Applebey, 1919).<br>
<br>As a youth Shrapnell-Smith developed a keen interest in the emergent technology of motoring. In December 1895 he attended a meeting organized by Sir David Salomons at the Cannon Street Hotel in London which resulted in the formation of the Self-Propelled Traffic Association (SPTA) to promote motoring and a motor transport industry in Great Britain. Shrapnell-Smith, who was the sole representative of Liverpool interests at the meeting, became honorary secretary of the association's Liverpool and district branch (LSPTA), founded in October 1896. From 1897 the branch doubled as the local centre of the newly established Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland (later RAC). Shrapnell-Smith was a founder and life member of the club; he served for a while as its vice-chairman and sat on its committee for forty-six years.<br>
<br>With the earl of Derby as its president, the LSPTA became a regional hub for the promotion of mechanized transport, particularly heavy vehicles. Between 1898 and 1901 Shrapnell-Smith was honorary organizing secretary for the LSPTA's three trials of heavy motor vehicles. The object of the trials was to test the ability of such vehicles to haul goods between local docks and warehouses and also between the port of Liverpool and inland towns. The first trials took place in a climate of scepticism (outside SPTA) about the ability of motorized vehicles to compete with horse-drawn transport and railways. The Liverpool trials, which were the first of their kind in England, demonstrated the ability of motor lorries to carry materials over long and short distances quickly, efficiently, and economically.<br>
<br>Shrapnell-Smith edited the judges' reports for all three trials; in 1899 and 1901 he sat on the trials sub-committee. The trials &#145;were instrumental in getting the pioneers to develop the lorry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Companion to British Road Haulage History</span>, 232). Shrapnell-Smith's reputation grew to the extent that in 1901 he was one of four motorists invited to accompany British army troops on cavalry manoeuvres.<br>
<br>Shrapnell-Smith's early successes with heavy motor vehicles provided the platform for his long and varied career in the commercial transport industry, business world, and public life more generally. In 1903 he helped found the Motor Van and Wagon Users' Association (Commercial Motors Users' Association from 1907). He was its honorary treasurer until 1918 before going on to serve as its chairman (1918) and president (1920&#150;29). In 1905 Edmund Dangerfield, a pioneer in the field of technical publications, appointed Shrapnell-Smith founding editor of the <span class="italic">Commercial Motor</span>. It was an &#145;inspired choice&#146;  (Seth-Smith, 47). With Shrapnell-Smith at the helm between 1905 and 1917, the magazine became the &#145;pre-eminent &hellip; most powerful and virile champion&#146; of Britain's commercial transport industry  (<span class="italic">Commercial Motor</span>, 18 April 1952). Because of his eccentric ways and insistence on correct grammar, printing staff referred to the editor as the &#145;comma king&#146;  (Seth-Smith, 47). During his editorship he became honorary vice-president of the Society of Motor Omnibus Engineers and honorary treasurer of the Roads Improvement Association. Before the First World War he conducted research on road resistance and foresaw the value of electric vehicles, especially in urban settings  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers</span>). He contributed the heavy commercial vehicles section within the motor vehicles entry in the 1911 edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>.<br>
<br>In September 1912 Shrapnell-Smith married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1879), younger daughter of Major-General Richard Temple Godman of Highden, Pulborough, Sussex. His best man was Arthur Stanley, Conservative MP and fellow motoring enthusiast. Shrapnell-Smith and his wife had a daughter and two sons. Their elder son, Thomas, a flight lieutenant in the RAF, was killed when flying on active service in Singapore in 1939.<br>
<br>During the First World War Shrapnell-Smith served as commandant in the Motor Transport Column of the City of London National Guard (1915&#150;19), retiring with the rank of honorary major. He also undertook charitable work as honorary secretary and treasurer of the Commercial Motor Campaign Comforts Fund for the Overseas Mechanical Transport Columns of the Army Service Corps (1914&#150;17). His wife served on the ladies' committee of the fund. He left <span class="italic">Commercial Motor</span> in 1917 and joined the Petroleum Executive as deputy director and chief economy officer (1917&#150;19). He accepted no remuneration but was rewarded by being made a CBE in 1918.<br>
<br>After the war Shrapnell-Smith served on numerous governmental, commercial, and philanthropic bodies concerned with matters of motor transport, sometimes, again, without payment. In addition, he gave evidence to several government committees of inquiry. His official positions included membership of the roads advisory committee, Ministry of Transport (1923&#150;33), and, from its inception in 1934 until its abolition in 1951, the <span class="roman">Road and Rail Traffic Act</span>, 1933, appeal tribunal. Between 1934 and 1944 he was chairman of the petroleum industry committee of the British Standards Institution. He was also honorary representative of the British government at international road congresses held in Milan (1926), Washington (1930), and Munich (1934). Among many other appointments he served as director-general of both the London Housing Bonds Campaign (1920) and Hospitals of London Combined Appeal (1922). He was a fellow of the Chemical Society and member of both the Institute of Transport and Institution of Chemical Engineers.<br>
<br>After the corporations of Liverpool and Birkenhead consulted him about the proposed Mersey tunnel in 1925 Shrapnell-Smith became an enthusiast for similar projects elsewhere, especially under the English Channel. He thought developments in aeronautics and gunnery rendered obsolete old concerns about defence risks. On behalf of the Commercial Motor Users' Association and in a personal capacity Shrapnell-Smith championed a tunnel link between Britain and France, favouring the use of electric vehicles rather than exhaust-emitting trucks (<span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, 3 Dec 1928; Channel Tunnel Association Archives).<br>
<br>In contrast to his progressive views on tunnels, Shrapnell-Smith opposed proposals for building out-of-town motorways, arguing that commercial vehicle routes needed to pass through urban centres. He was a member of many deputations that sought to influence government transport policy and fiercely opposed Churchill's 1926 &#145;raid&#146; on the Road Fund. He thought also that pedestrians should assume greater responsibility for their own safety  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Oct 1926).<br>
<br>Shrapnell-Smith twice stood for parliament as Conservative candidate for the East Woolwich constituency. He lost to the Labour candidate by over 8500 votes in the 1929 general election. In April 1931 he contested a by-election and increased substantially his share of the vote but still lost to his Labour opponent by 3843 votes  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 April 1931). Soon afterwards he experienced a nervous breakdown owing to pressure of work  (Shrapnell-Smith, <span class="italic">What is the Prana of Yoga? A Thesis</span>, 21).<br>
<br>In youth Shrapnell-Smith was dark-haired and moustachioed. In later life he retained the moustache but became bald. He had a good sense of humour and was always well dressed. For much of his adult life he lived at Hound House, Shere, Surrey. In his final years he became interested in yoga. He claimed to have achieved great health benefits through a combination of deep breathing and &#145;prana&#146; (vital force) which he identified as incoming cosmic radiation. In 1951 he outlined his ideas in a booklet: <span class="italic">What is the Prana of Yoga? A Thesis</span>. On 8 April 1952, he collapsed and died while delivering an after dinner speech to senior members of the East Kent Road Company at the County Hotel in Canterbury. Cause of death was &#145;coronary occlusion&#146;  (d. cert.).<br>
<br>With his &#145;unrivalled knowledge of the youthful commercial vehicle industry&#146; Shrapnell-Smith's &#145;influence on the formative period of the [road haulage] industry was considerable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Companion to British Road Haulage History</span>, 360). Although his range of professional activities became extensive, he continued to play a &#145;vital part&#146; in its development throughout the interwar period, if not beyond  (Seth-Smith, 48).<br>
