<span class="headword">Petter, Sir  Ernest Willoughby</span>  (1873&#150;1954), <span class="occ">engine and aircraft manufacturer</span>, and his business partner, <a name="cosubject_48102"></a><span class="headword">Percival Waddams Petter</span>  (1873&#150;1955), were identical twins born on 26 May 1873 in High Street, Yeovil, Somerset, the third and fourth of the fifteen children of James Bazeley Petter, ironmonger, of Yeovil, and his wife, Charlotte Waddams, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Branscombe, of Bristol, the daughter of a rubber merchant. They were educated at Yeovil grammar school, and after two years at Mount Radford School, Exeter, they left school in 1890 at the age of sixteen to start apprenticeships in their father's business.<br>
<br>The ironmongery firm of Harman and Gillett in Yeovil had been given to James Petter by his father as a wedding present. He later acquired the Yeovil Foundry and Engineering Works, making agricultural machinery, and also started the Nautilus Stove Company, making grates and kitchen ranges, much in demand after Queen Victoria had installed Nautilus fire grates at Balmoral Castle and Osborne House. Percival, Percy as he was generally known, became manager of the foundry in 1895, and he, in particular, became interested in the new horseless carriages being designed on the continent. With the help of the foreman he designed and built a single-cylinder 1 hp oil engine and installed it in a chassis built by the local carriage builders, Hill and Boll. Demonstrated in 1895, this was one of the first vehicles propelled by internal combustion to be produced in Great Britain. The Yeovil Motor Car and Cycle Company Ltd was established and twelve motor cars were built following the appearance of a technical description of the Petter horseless carriage in <span class="italic">The Engineer</span> in 1896. But the company did not prosper, and the Petters decided to concentrate on small oil engines for agricultural use. The Petter Patent Oil Engine (1.25 hp) was exhibited at the Royal Show in 1899, and in 1901 the brothers bought the business from their father, and it was reorganized as James B. Petter &amp; Sons Ltd, with Ernest and Percy Petter as joint managing directors. The range of oil engines was expanded, with power outputs from 1.25 to 22 hp, and in 1902 they produced an agricultural tractor powered by a 30 hp oil engine.<br>
<br>After its registration as a public company in 1910 Petters Ltd continued to expand and by 1912 had over 500 employees and was producing 1500 engines a year. The existing foundry could not cope with this level of production, and in 1913 a site was found at West Hendford, west of Yeovil, for a new foundry and a garden village for the employees, which became known as Westland.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the First World War the demand for engines increased but in 1915 Ernest Petter, the new chairman of Petters Ltd, persuaded the board to put its manufacturing resources at the disposal of the government. As a result, Petters was asked to build aeroplanes, beginning with an order for twelve Short seaplanes. Westland Aircraft Works was founded as a subsidiary of Petters with R. A. Bruce, former managing director of the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company in Bristol, as managing director. The seaplanes were followed by Sopwith fighters and Airco De Havilland bombers, and nearly a thousand planes were built by the end of the war. By then Westland Aircraft Works had built up a design office and converted neighbouring farmland into an airfield in order to be able to test planes, and when the DH 9 bomber was found to have shortcomings in its design, Westland's drawing office was asked to redesign it to enable it to take the American Liberty engine. The success of the DH 9A bomber brought Westland recognition.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Petters, with Percy Petter as managing director, continued to make engines together with shell cases and gun carriage equipment. After the war, it concentrated on the production of diesel and petrol engines, which were used throughout the world as agricultural engines, electricity generators, and marine engines. A venture in association with Vickers, Vickers Petters Ltd, in Ipswich, formed to produce large diesel engines and managed by Ernest Petter, was less successful.<br>
<br>The Petters continued to regard the aircraft works very much as a sideline to the oil engine business. Westland Aircraft Works, like other aircraft manufacturers, suffered after the war from the cancellation of military contracts. The design office produced seventeen new designs but none was accepted until 1927, when the works won the government contract for the Wapiti, a replacement for the DH 9A. More than a thousand Wapitis had been sold all over the world by the early 1930s, including more than five hundred to the RAF, and they accounted for most of the Westland production between 1927 and 1934. In the early 1930s exports of Petter oil engines fell, and it was the aircraft works which kept the firm going.<br>
<br>In 1935 the Petters decided to separate the engine and aircraft businesses completely, and Westland Aircraft Ltd was registered as a public company, with Petters Ltd retaining half the shares. In 1938, John Brown Ltd, the Clydeside shipbuilding firm, bought a controlling interest in Westland. Ernest Petter, who had been knighted in 1925, resigned as chairman of Petters Ltd and Westland Aircraft Ltd, sold his aircraft shares to Associated Electrical Industries Ltd, and emigrated to Victoria, British Columbia; Percy Petter resigned as vice-chairman. The Petters Ltd engine business was sold to Brush Electrical Engineering Ltd, and moved to Loughborough.<br>
<br>Ernest Petter stood unsuccessfully for parliament three times, twice contesting Bristol North as a Conservative, in 1918 and 1923, and St George's, Westminster, in a 1931 by-election. He published a number of pamphlets on industrial economics, including <span class="italic">The Disease of Unemployment and the Cure</span> (1925). He was president of the British Engineers' Association from 1923 to 1925, and was knighted after organizing the engineering section of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1925. In 1907 he married Angela Emma (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of Henry Petter of Calcutta; they had three sons, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35497/', "(William) Edward Willoughby Petter")</script>, became an aircraft designer, and one daughter. After her death he married, in 1935, Lucy Ellen, daughter of Charles Hopkins of Portsmouth. Petter returned to England from Canada in 1953, and died at his home, Bywell, Spencer Road, New Milton, Hampshire, on 18 July 1954, survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Percy Petter, in contrast to his extrovert brother, was shy and withdrawn, and a teetotaller. A devout Anglican and a member of the Christian Brethren, in 1919 he was one of the &#145;Pilgrim preachers&#146; who preached on a journey between Bath and London. He retained his interest in invention, and as late as 1932 designed a desk calculating machine, the Petometer, which sold in small numbers. Percy Petter was active in local politics, and was mayor of Yeovil 1925&#150;7. He married in 1904 Emily Kennan of Dublin, daughter of one of the selling agents for Petter engines in Ireland. They had two sons and four daughters. After her death he married Ruth Penson-Harris. Percy Petter died at his home, Heather Lawn, Seaway Avenue, Christchurch, Hampshire, on 15 September 1955, and was buried at Yeovil cemetery on 19 September. His wife survived him.<br>
