<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pick,  Frank</span>  (1878&#150;1941), <span class="occ">transport administrator</span>, was born at Spalding, Lincolnshire, on 23 November 1878, the eldest child of Francis Pick, draper, of Stamford, and his wife, Fanny Clark, of South Ferriby. His early years were spent at York where he held a scholarship at St Peter's School and was then articled to a solicitor. Having qualified in 1902 he took his LLB (London) with first-class honours in the following year. In 1904 he married Mabel Mary Caroline, daughter of Charles Simeon Woodhouse, solicitor, of York. They had no children.<br>
<br>In 1902, Pick entered the service of the North Eastern Railway Company, and after working in various departments joined the staff of the general manager, Sir George Gibb. In 1906 Gibb went to London to take over the management of the Metropolitan District and London Underground Electric Railways and took Pick with him. In the following year Gibb retired from his direct managerial responsibility and Pick was transferred to the staff of his successor, A. H. Stanley, later Lord Ashfield.<br>
<br>Henceforward Pick was closely associated with Stanley in the management of the underground railways of London and of the associated company, taken over in 1912, the London General Omnibus Company. As traffic development officer (1909) and commercial manager (1912) he was responsible, in particular, for building up the system of bus routes in London and also for advertising. In 1917 Pick was appointed by his chief, then president of the Board of Trade in Lloyd George's wartime government, to take charge of the household fuel and lighting branch of the coal-mines control department, under Guy Calthrop. Returning to the underground group of companies after the war, Pick became a joint assistant managing director in 1921 and three years later assumed full administrative control under Ashfield. He became joint managing director in 1928 and, when the London Passenger Transport Board was formed in 1933 with Ashfield as chairman, Pick was the natural choice for vice-chairman and chief executive officer.<br>
<br>It was the combination of Pick and Ashfield, rather than the work of either as an individual, that brought about the remarkable development of public passenger transport in London in the thirty years prior to the outbreak of war in 1939. The two men were essentially complementary. Ashfield was at his best in dealing with politicians, shareholders, and the public. Pick, on the other hand, was a very shy man, but he had great qualities as an administrator. He was primarily responsible for the day-to-day efficiency of a system which technically was generally acknowledged to be without equal anywhere in the world. He had a very quick mind and an exceptional grasp of operating and engineering principles and techniques. There was no part of the transport undertaking of which he did not have a thorough understanding; and the power of decision came easily to him. Furthermore, he had a wide interest in the visual arts and fervently believed in the importance of good design in everyday things. London's transport system gave him a unique opportunity to encourage modern art. He commissioned Edward Johnston to design an alphabet for display purposes (1916), and London Transport lettering on direction signs and posters became celebrated for its clarity. In the period between the two world wars Pick raised the whole standard of poster design by the example which he set; he sought out artists of quality, both young and old, including such masters of the art of the poster as Fred Taylor and Edward McKnight Kauffer. Station design, ranging from the overall architecture to details such as waste-paper baskets, was subject to Pick's personal scrutiny to ensure that the fundamental principle of good design, fitness for purpose, was properly observed. The many examples of excellent contemporary architecture in the buildings erected by London Transport in Pick's time are lasting monuments to his ideals. He was president of the Design and Industries Association from 1932 to 1934 and when the Council for Art and Industry was set up by the Board of Trade in 1934, with the object of improving standards of design in the products of industry, he was selected to be its first chairman. One of his few recreations was opera at Covent Garden.<br>
<br>Pick retired from the London Passenger Transport Board in 1940 and was for a short and unhappy time director-general of the Ministry of Information. In 1941 he undertook special duties for the minister of transport in connection with the development of traffic on canals and inland waterways. He died at his home, 15 Wildwood Road, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 7 November 1941.<br>
