<span class="headword">Young,  Thomas</span>  (1507&#150;1568), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was born at Hodgeston, near Lamphey, Pembrokeshire, the son of John Young and Eleanor, his wife. He was a student at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, graduating BA in 1529 and MA in 1533.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerinWalesandEmden"></a>Early career in Wales and Emden</h2>According to a later report of John Philpott, Young had studied civil law for some years before taking holy orders. He was appointed principal of his hall in 1542 and resigned in 1546. By this time he had become vicar of Llanfihangel Castle, Cardiganshire (1541), and in close succession rector of Hodgeston and Nashwith-Upton (1542) and prebendary of Trallong in the collegiate church of Abergwili, near Carmarthen (1545). In 1542 he became precentor of St David's, entering into residence in 1547, though his time in the cathedral was marked by an acrimonious dispute with the new bishop and later Marian martyr, Robert Ferrar. On his appointment in 1548 Ferrar accused Young and the chancellor, Roland Meyrick, of having despoiled the see during the vacancy; the two men were alleged to have made away with crosses, chalices, and other plate to the value of 500 marks or more. Both were dismissed and promptly drew up counter-articles against their bishop, who in turn mounted a vigorous defence. It is uncertain whether this case had reached any conclusion by the time of Edward VI's death on 6 July 1553. Later that year Bishop Ferrar was arrested and imprisoned because of his protestant opinions; following the passage of the appropriate legislation he became one of the first of the Marian martyrs. Young is said to have visited him in prison and asked his forgiveness for the unseemly wrangle in St David's.<br>
<br>On Mary's accession Young was at least prepared boldly to aver his own protestantism. He was one of the six protestant divines who defended the faith at the convocation of 1553, as John Philpott records. This made him a marked man, and he soon after elected to join the exile abroad; though not apparently without attempting to secure some continuing benefit from his Welsh benefices by leasing his prebend at Lampeter to George Lee, a Calais merchant and brother to his close friend Thomas Lee. Like others leaving the country, Young attempted to obscure his intentions by antedating the lease, a common enough stratagem, but in this case unavailing. Little was previously known of this phase of his life, but documents which came to light in Germany in the 1990s confirm that he spent the entirety of Mary's reign in Emden, the most northerly of the exile congregations. Indeed he played a far more prominent role in the affairs of the church there than was formerly recognized. Also, the church had more members (about 100) and was better organized: it met for services three times a week and followed a church order and discipline modelled on John &agrave; Lasco's church order for the London stranger church, the <span class="roman">Forma ac Ratio</span>. Young served as one of the two ministers, alongside John Scory, former bishop of Rochester; he enrolled as a citizen of Emden on 5 November 1555. They were assisted in the care of the congregation by six elders and nine deacons. Both ministers were of a stubborn and disputatious temper, and this was reflected in a bitter dispute with one of their own members, John Dowley. Dowley had taken offence that the congregation had moved its services from the normal place of worship close to a house infected by the plague. When he pursued the matter, the ministers denounced him in open church. Young, who was described in the proceedings as well trained in English jurisprudence, took a particularly prominent part against him. The case was appealed by Dowley to the local town community, which, perhaps inflamed by the refusal of the English ministers to appear and answer, essentially ruled in Dowley's favour.<h2>
<a name="StDavidsandYork"></a>St David's and York</h2>On the death of Mary, Young swiftly returned to England. With a chequered and not particularly successful career behind him he was not initially marked out for high office; his gradual but inexorable rise to one of the greatest prizes of the new church hierarchy is among the most fascinating tales of the Elizabethan settlement. He was not on Cecil's early lists of those intended for episcopal positions, but refusals on the part of some of the leading candidates, together with the queen's aversion to any taint of Genevan influence, opened the path to higher things. Young certainly proved himself an able courtier. Named to both the Canterbury visitation and the western circuit (the Welsh dioceses and Hereford and Worcester), he demonstrated his zeal for the new settlement with a long, arduous summer ensuring its enforcement. By the autumn he was earmarked for a return to St David's, but now as bishop. He was elected on 6 December 1559, confirmed on 18 January following, and consecrated at Lambeth three days later. On 23 March he obtained the restitution of his temporalities. But Young did not have to content himself with the modest Welsh see for long. In the matter of the temporalities he had secured the good offices of Lord Robert Dudley, and this proved to be an enduring alliance. Archbishop Parker too became a generous patron. Already in April 1560 he had written to hint to Young that he might expect &#145;other places &hellip; more honourable and more profitable&#146; than St David's  (Bruce and Perowne, 114).<br>
<br>Meanwhile the new establishment's failure to provide for the northern province was becoming ever more scandalous and urgent. When consideration turned in the summer of 1560 to filling the vacant positions Parker was quick to nominate Young: &#145;if you would have a lawyer at York, the Bishop of St David's, Dr Young, is both witty, prudent, and temperate, and man-like&#146;  (Bruce and Perowne, 123). With such an endorsement and the support of the new court favourite, Dudley, Young's success was assured. He was elected archbishop on 27 January 1561 and confirmed on 5 February, and received restoration of his temporalities on 4 March. Even here he was marked by conspicuous signs of royal favour, being assessed for the first fruit due to the crown on a careful survey which set them at the modest figure of &pound;1449 (against an assessment in the <i>valor ecclesiasticus</i> of &pound;2036). This was at pains to point out that a figure of &pound;130 13<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>. had been abated by royal warrant because of the queen's &#145;favourable consideration&#146; of Young himself.<br>
<br>Once established in the northern province Young was notable for an absence of crusading zeal. The puritan Thomas Wood singled him out as one of the most infamous of the non-preaching bishops. A fairer assessment might regard him as pragmatic, rather than negligent. The north country was notoriously conservative, and he had few supporters for a campaign for active evangelism, even in the limited urban centres of his diocese. In the 1564 survey of religious opinions demanded by the government Young was able to return only two of York's thirteen aldermen as favourers of religion. It may have been that a more active policy might simply have provoked a more adverse reaction. Arguably, the limited popular support for the rising of the northern earls in 1569 may be considered the ultimate test of his pragmatic policies.<h2>
<a name="Anarchbishopsoccupations"></a>An archbishop's occupations</h2>In truth Young was first and foremost a royal agent and administrator. In 1564 he was named president of the council of the north, a signal mark of royal confidence, for which he received a stipend of &pound;666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. per annum. In the large questions of ecclesiastical politics he offered Parker strong support, at the same time continuing assiduously to cultivate his relationship with Dudley. In the controversy over clerical dress in 1566 Young stoutly upheld Parker's <span class="italic">Advertisements</span> with none of the apparent misgivings of several of his fellow bishops, smoothly assuring the queen that her firmness would be &#145;a very great comfort to many good subjects that now stand amazed and discouraged&#146;  (Collinson, 73). The obligation to Dudley proved increasingly burdensome, since the royal favourite was not slow to exploit his position with former clients upon whom he had special claims. A series of disadvantageous land transactions was the result. Towards the end of his life Young was bold enough to refuse the earl a requested loan of &pound;1000 on the grounds that he was too poor, only to be compromised by the discovery of a shipload of lead from the roof of York palace hall which he had consigned for sale in London.<br>
<br>The management of the archiepiscopal estates perforce absorbed a great deal of Young's attention in the northern counties. Always the supplicant in his relationship with Dudley, locally the tables were turned, and Young was the recipient of useful favours from compliant local powers. In 1565 he was given an exceptionally long lease on a city moat and rampart (useful grazing ground) by York city council, so that he should &#145;contynewe good and gracyouse lord to this city&#146;  (Palliser, 265). The archbishop responded by inviting a mayor of York, Robert Paycok, to act as godfather to his son George. Young was an assiduous steward of the interests of his family, having provided his elder son, Thomas, to the prebend of Barnby in 1561, when the boy was only sixteen. Local opinion would hardly have censured him for this: later in the century Archbishop Sandys was far more energetic in the pursuit of offices for a larger family. A more serious charge was that he abused his office and from motives of personal gain sometimes advanced men who were scarcely favourable to the Reformation. One prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Sir John Constable, was removed from the council of the north in 1567, only a year after Young had supported his appointment, on the grounds of his untrustworthy reputation in matters of religion. Venal or not, the archbishop seems to have been a more than capable manager of his lands and flocks. An inventory of his goods at the time of his death records that he had corn in stock to the value of &pound;113 and livestock worth &pound;324, including a flock of over 800 sheep. Indeed he seems to have been exceptionally successful in husbanding the meagre assets of his northern see. The account of his administrator reveals an inventory of goods worth &pound;2657 and good debts of over &pound;1000. Part of this capital was realized by the questionable practice of lending money at interest, though he was not alone among his fellow bishops in resorting to this.<br>
<br>There is also more than a hint that in his capacity as president of the northern council Young exploited his position as judge for private gain. His successor as president, the third earl of Sussex, made short shrift of cases that Young had unaccountably allowed to linger in the court; though the extent to which this might have been attributable to his failing powers in old age rather than to deliberate corruption is difficult to determine. Certainly in early 1567 he was provided with a suffragan (Richard Barnes, chancellor of York, who became bishop of Nottingham) because of his age.<br>
<br>Young died at Sheffield on 26 June 1568 and was buried in York Minster. He married twice. His first wife (forename unknown) was a daughter of George Constantine, registrar of St David's and subsequently a fellow exile with Young in Emden. Following her death he married Jane, daughter of Thomas Kynaston of Estwick, Staffordshire; she was the mother of his son George, who was later knighted.<br>
