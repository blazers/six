</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bligh,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1817), <span class="occ">naval officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Plymouth on 9 September 1754, the only son of Francis Bligh (1721&#150;1780) and his wife, Jane Pearse, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Balsam (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1770). The Bligh family had long resided at Tinten in Cornwall. Bligh's father was a customs officer at Plymouth; other family members had entered the army and the navy. William Bligh is recorded in the <i>Monmouth</i>'s muster book as &#145;Captain's Servant&#146; in 1762, as able seaman in that of the <i>Hunter</i> in July 1770, and as midshipman (<i>Hunter</i>) from February 1771. In September 1771 he transferred to the <i>Crescent</i> (36 guns), then, in September 1775, to the <i>Ranger</i>, from which he gained his lieutenant's passing certificate on 1 May 1776. Bligh must have shown distinct ability in these postings, for in March 1776, preparing for his third voyage of exploration to the Pacific Ocean, Captain James Cook chose the still quite junior officer as master of the <i>Resolution</i>.<br>
<br>For three years Bligh oversaw the working of the ship, and assisted in the navigation and charting of this immense voyage (1776&#150;80), which explored the islands and coastlines of the northern Pacific Ocean, and which saw Cook killed at Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii, in February 1779. Afterwards Bligh was bitter that Captain James King did not make what he considered to be proper acknowledgement of his contributions in King's <span class="italic">A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean</span> (1784):<blockquote>None of the Maps and Charts in this publication are from the original drawings of Lieutenant Henry Roberts; he did no more than copy the original ones from Captain Cook, who besides myself was the only person that surveyed and laid the coast down, in the <i>Resolution</i>. Every plan &amp; Chart from C. Cook's death are exact Copies of my Works. (marginalia in the copy in the Admiralty library)</blockquote>After his return to England Bligh was promoted lieutenant (September 1781), and served in a number of line-of-battle ships in the North Sea and the Mediterranean. He went on half pay on 13 January 1783.<br>
<br>Bligh had married Elizabeth Betham (1754?&#150;1812) at Douglas on the Isle of Man on 4 February 1781. The couple had three daughters in the next years, and three more subsequently. With the peace Bligh undertook a series of trading voyages to the West Indies in vessels owned by his wife's relative Duncan Campbell, the overseer of the convict hulks in the Thames. Fatefully, he took <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5356/', "Fletcher Christian")</script> with him on two of these, and the pair became friendly.<br>
<br>In mid-1787, as a consequence of Sir Joseph Banks's patronage, Bligh received the command of the <i>Bounty</i>, then being fitted to transport breadfruit and other plants from the islands of the central Pacific Ocean and from south-east Asia to the West Indies. This proposed plant transfer was part of an elaborate scheme to increase British trade with Asia: the mechanization of the spinning and weaving industry then beginning was creating the capacity for greatly expanded production; cotton goods might be manufactured in England, and exported to India and, especially, China; the growth of this trade would both give East India Company ships outward cargoes, and lessen the need for the British to find silver with which to purchase Chinese goods; for greater production of cotton goods, more raw supplies were needed; if plantation owners might feed slaves more cheaply, then large-scale cotton cultivation might become feasible in the West Indies; the breadfruit and other fruits and vegetables which grew in great abundance in the eastern tropics might become cheap staples for the slaves.<br>
<br>With a crew of forty-four, Fletcher Christian among them, the <i>Bounty</i> sailed in December 1787. After failing to enter the Pacific Ocean round Cape Horn, Bligh reached Tahiti at the end of October 1788. Laden with more than 1000 young breadfruit plants, he sailed again at the beginning of April 1789. In the early morning of 28 April 1789, when off the island of Tofua (Tonga), Fletcher Christian led part of the crew in mutiny [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96371', "Bounty mutineers")</script>].<br>
<br>Subsequent events, and their repeated evocation in literature and film, have made this mutiny the most famous in the history of the sea. The rebels set Bligh and eighteen men adrift in the ship's 23 foot long launch, with little food and only minimal navigational tools. Incredibly Bligh managed to reach Kupang in Timor two months later with the loss of only one man, after a harrowing 3500 mile voyage. The mutineers spent nine months ranging the central Pacific in search of a haven. In the end some chose to remain at Tahiti, where they were arrested by Captain Edward Edwards and subsequently tried at court martial. Others went with Christian and Polynesian companions to a bloody fate on Pitcairn, then mislocated on charts. The causes of the mutiny and the motives of the mutineers have been much debated. Bligh suggested that the rebels listened to Tahiti's siren song; Christian's supporters, on the other hand, argued that Bligh's harsh treatment had driven him mad. While puzzles remain, it is clear that Bligh and Christian became locked into a deeply ambivalent symbiosis that led to tragedy.<br>
<br>In 1791&#150;3 Bligh returned to the Pacific with the <i>Providence</i> and the <i>Assistant</i>; and this time succeeded in bringing the breadfruit to the West Indies. On his return to England he found that his reputation had been much diminished by evidence presented at the trial of the captured <i>Bounty</i> mutineers. War with France having broken out, he returned to active service, taking command of the <i>Calcutta</i> (26 guns) in April 1795, then, as post captain, of the <i>Director</i> (64 guns) in January 1796. He participated in the battle of Camperdown under Admiral Adam Duncan (11 October 1797), and in the battle of Copenhagen under Nelson (2 April 1801), in both of which he acted courageously. In these years, though, he suffered the indignity of another mutiny, at the Nore, in May 1797 after which he strenuously protected his men and ensured that none were hanged for participation. After the Nore Bligh suffered a case of serious insubordination by Lieutenant John Frazier on the <i>Warrior</i> in 1804. In February 1805 the court martial brought by Frazier &#145;reprimanded&#146; Bligh, and &#145;admonished&#146; him to be &#145;in future more correct in his language&#146;  (Kennedy, <span class="italic">Mutinies</span>, 278).<br>
<br>In 1805 Sir Joseph Banks procured for Bligh the governorship of the New South Wales colony. After a voyage during which he and Captain Joseph Short argued incessantly, Bligh arrived in August 1806, to find the society deeply divided between the military and civilian officers and free settlers (&#145;exclusives&#146;) on the one hand, and convicts and former convicts (&#145;emancipists&#146;) on the other. Bligh took the part of the smallholders about the Hawkesbury River in their economic quarrels with the exclusives. Following a series of skirmishes the officers of the New South Wales Corps deposed him on 26 January 1808. After a weary exile on the <i>Porpoise</i>, mostly in the Derwent estuary outside Hobart, Bligh was superseded by Lachlan Macquarie in January 1810.<br>
<br>Bligh returned to England in October 1810. In May 1801 he had been elected FRS. He was promoted by seniority rear-admiral (July 1811), then vice-admiral (1814). His wife having died on 15 April 1812, Bligh relocated his family to Farningham in Kent. He died on 7 December 1817 in Bond Street, London, and was buried next to his wife at St Mary, Lambeth.<br>
<br>William Bligh was clearly a superior navigator; and danger, whether on an arduous ocean or in the heat of battle, brought out the best in him. But he was an abysmal leader otherwise, and this incapacity became more pronounced with age. A brief acquaintance showed Macquarie that &#145;[Bligh] certainly is a most disagreeable Person to have any dealings, or Publick business to transact with; having no regard whatever to his promise or engagements however sacred, and his natural temper is uncommonly harsh, and tyrannical in the extreme&#146;  (Kennedy, <span class="italic">Mutinies</span>, 299).<br>
<br>It is important to note, however, that Bligh's &#145;violence&#146; was habitually more verbal than physical (his cruel punishment of David Collins's young son on the <i>Porpoise</i> notwithstanding). Greg Dening has established that Bligh flogged less than any other British commander in the Pacific Ocean in the later eighteenth century. What most threw Bligh into &#145;those violent Tornados of temper&#146;  (Kennedy, <span class="italic">Mutinies</span>, 306), during which he gestured violently with his hands, was perceived dereliction of duty by officers and seamen's incompetence. When either of these occurred Bligh's invective could bruise men's egos as much as any lash their backs. After the <i>Bounty</i> left Tahiti, Bligh fretted excessively about the plants' welfare. When officers and crew offended he called them &#145;damn'd Infernal scoundrels, blackguard, liar, vile man, jesuit, thief, lubber, disgrace to the service, damn'd long pelt of a bitch&#146;; he told them he would make them &#145;eat grass like cows&#146;; he told the officers that he would make them jump overboard before they reached Torres Strait (Barney, 64, 69; <span class="italic">Journal of James Morrison</span>, 19). Interestingly, this &#145;bad language&#146; was not obscene in the modern sense; rather, it was humiliating and dislocating. As Dening puts it, &#145;[Bligh's language] was bad, not so much because it was intemperate or abusive, but because it was ambiguous, because men could not read in it a right relationship to his authority&#146;  (Dewing, 61). Bligh's great failing was that he was so unaware of the effect his mood swings and harsh criticisms had on those about him. The story of the <i>Bounty</i> proved popular with twentieth-century film-makers, most notably in Frank Lloyd's <span class="italic">Mutiny on the Bounty</span> (1935), in which Bligh was played by Charles Laughton, and in subsequent remakes in 1962 and 1984, when the role of the captain was taken by Trevor Howard and Anthony Hopkins respectively. In these depictions, Bligh appears as overbearing and cruel, and as significantly older than he was (at thirty-four he was only ten years older than Christian).<br>
