<span class="headword">Honey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Young]</span>,  Laura Martha</span>  (1816?&#150;1843), <span class="occ">actress</span>, said to have been born on 6 December 1816, was the daughter of Mrs Young, an actress at Sadler's Wells, and as a girl worked in the wardrobe of that house. She first appeared on the stage there, under the name of Laura Bell, in some juvenile parts. In 1826 she was with her mother at the Olympic, and in 1827 played a midshipman in Bayle Bernard's <span class="italic">Casco Bay</span>. After a brief engagement at the Surrey, where she took lessons in music, she returned to Sadler's Wells in 1829. At the age of sixteen she married William Honey, a lawyer's clerk, from whom she soon separated; he continued to live on her earnings. He was accidentally drowned in the Thames in 1836. Mrs Honey went in 1832 with Harriet Waylett to the Strand, where she first appeared in Leman Rede's <span class="italic">The Loves of the Angels</span>. In 1833 she was at the Queen's (subsequently the Prince of Wales's) Theatre, under Mrs Nisbet. At the Adelphi under F. H. Yates she made a great success as Psyche in a burlesque called <span class="italic">Cupid</span> with John Reeve, and as Lurline in the fairy drama of that name.<br>
<br>After a season at the Haymarket, where she played in J. B. Buckstone's <span class="italic">Open House</span>, and a tour in the provinces, Laura Honey went to the Olympic under Madame Vestris. She was described as &#145;the delicious Mrs Honey, beautiful as a houri, with the throat of a nightingale&#146;  (Baker, 2.148). In 1837 she undertook the management of the City of London Theatre, where she played Tom Tug in <span class="italic">The Waterman</span>, Myrtilla in Planch&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Riquet with the Tuft</span>, and in <span class="italic">The Spirit of the Rhine</span> by Morris Barnett, in which she sang with great effect &#145;My Beautiful Rhine&#146;, which long remained popular. In her last season she performed at the Haymarket and in the provinces, and returned to the City of London. She died on 1 April 1843, from &#145;ulcers in the chest&#146;, at her home, 149 Albany Street, Regent's Park, and was buried on the 6th in the churchyard of the Old Church, Hampstead. She bequeathed her property by will to two children aged respectively ten and three. She was a pleasing and graceful actress, particularly in breeches roles, and a delightful ballad singer, but her performances were practically confined to the lightest class of entertainment.<br>
