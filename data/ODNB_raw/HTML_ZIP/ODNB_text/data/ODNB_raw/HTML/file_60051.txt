<span class="headword">Bard,  Wilkie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>William August Smith]</span>  (1874&#150;1944), <span class="occ">music-hall performer</span>, was born on 19 March 1874 at 19 Alderley Street, Hulme, Manchester, son of William Herbert Smith, a bookkeeper, and his wife, Marie Stetzer. He was educated in Manchester, first worked there in a cotton spinner's warehouse, and became well known as a concert singer, performing at such local venues as the Slip Inn, the Falstaff, and Liston's Bar. He made his first professional appearance on 11 February 1895 at the Grand, Manchester, as a singer of coster songs (such as &#145;'E ain't the bloke I took him for at all&#146;), billed as Will Gebard (from a family name). Shortly afterwards he secured a twelve-week contract for the Moss and Thornton tour, a leading music-hall circuit.<br>
<br>Bard made his London d&eacute;but on 6 May 1895 at Collins Music-Hall, Islington&#151;it seems he adopted his stage name of Wilkie Bard about this time. One of several reasons given is that his grotesque make-up resembled the accepted image of Shakespeare; it featured a high, bald forehead, with black spots above each eyebrow, and became so celebrated that P. G. Wodehouse, in his 1910 novel <span class="italic">Psmith in the City</span>, compared one of its female characters to him. Bard's earliest successes included &#145;All becos 'e's minding a 'ouse&#146; and &#145;Our Dramatic Club&#146;, written by Frank Leo, who composed many of his most popular songs. His first pantomime engagement was at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin (1899/1900), as the baron in <span class="italic">Little Red Riding Hood</span>. He soon became popular as a pantomime dame, with a distinctively mellifluous voice. He married Nellie Stratton (<i>c</i>.1875&#150;1947), a fellow music-hall performer, in 1894 and they often appeared on stage together.<br>
<br>Bard formed a partnership with Will Evans, appearing in pantomime for several seasons at Drury Lane from 1908, reviving the harlequinade tradition with himself as Pantaloon and Evans as Clown. In 1912 Bard was selected to appear at the first royal command variety performance at London's Palace Theatre, performing his character study &#145;The Nightwatchman&#146; but exceeding the time-limit allocated to his spot, to the consternation of the management. He recorded more than thirty songs between 1904 and 1936, including his most famous&#151;&#145;I want to sing in opera&#146;&#151;and such pantomime tongue-twisters as &#145;She sells sea shells on the sea shore&#146;, which established his reputation.<br>
<br>In 1913 Bard played the Palace Theatre, New York, but quit after a poor reception at his opening matin&eacute;e. When <span class="italic">Variety</span>'s correspondent told him he shouldn't try to Americanize his act he reverted to his usual style and was an overwhelming box-office success. He could command up to &pound;600 per week on tour in the USA and a top fee of &pound;250 at home. According to pioneer agent George Foster, Bard &#145;had a grand sense of character burlesque &hellip; he always managed to make amusing observations of human eccentricities, and his method of working was all the more effective because it was quiet and never forced&#146;  (Foster, 93). The eminent music critic Neville Cardus described how Wilkie Bard, as a charwoman, came down the stage carrying a bucket of soapsuds and a cleaning cloth. On his knees he made a wide wet circle on the floor with the cloth, indicating the area to be cleaned; suddenly rising he would come before the footlights and announce by song, in a soft contralto voice, that &#145;I want to sing in opera&#146;, &#145;thus confiding in us a lofty but natural ambition&#146;  (Cardus, 29).<br>
<br>When music-hall waned Bard worked in newly popular revues, directing <span class="italic">The Whirl of the Town</span> at the London Palladium in 1915. In 1921 he spent most of the year touring South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. He retired early but returned to the stage in Sir Oswald Stoll's <span class="italic">Veterans of Variety</span> at the London Coliseum in 1927, where he had been a favourite in earlier times. Two of Bard's most famous sketches, &#145;The Nightwatchman&#146; and &#145;The Cleaner&#146;, were filmed by British Sound Film Productions in 1928 but are now believed to be lost. He also took part in Lew Lake's <span class="italic">Stars who Never Fail to Shine</span> tours from 1931 although, it seems, his mental health was beginning to decline. Bard broadcast for the BBC from its earliest days and radio producer Charles Brewer recalled how he would discuss a proposed broadcast in a quiet, dignified manner.<br>
<br>In 1939 Bard appeared in <span class="italic">Stars who Made the Holborn Empire Famous</span>, along with Ada Reeve, who recalled in her autobiography that he was by then a sick man. Nevertheless, he still appeared regularly in pantomime until his death on 5 May 1944 at his home, Glengarry, Trees Road, Hughenden, Buckinghamshire. His wife found him dead in an armchair after he had been listening to the nine o'clock news on radio: he had suffered a coronary thrombosis. He was buried in Highgate cemetery, Middlesex. The <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist recalled that &#145;the picture of him standing, hands folded in front of him, leaning slightly forward, with a tolerant, attentive gaze on his face under the domed bald forehead and the eyebrows painted out and replaced with the black dots&#146;, lingered vividly in the memory, as did &#145;the slightly muffled, fruity quality of his speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Wilkie Bard's name has entered music-hall mythology as rhyming slang: use of the Variety Artists' Federation (later part of Equity) membership card to gain performers free admittance to matin&eacute;es has been referred to as &#145;getting in on the Wilkie&#146;.<br>
