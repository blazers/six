<span class="headword">Lisle, Sir  (Henry de) Beauvoir  De</span>  (1864&#150;1955), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 27 July 1864 on Guernsey, one of five sons of Richard Francis Valpy De Lisle MRCS, honorary deputy inspector-general, and his wife, C. E. de Lisle. His father had served as an assistant surgeon of the 96th foot (1841&#150;51), and of the 1st (Royal) Dragoons (1851&#150;2), and as surgeon of the 4th (King's Own) foot (1852&#150;9) including service in the Crimean War.<br>
<br>Beauvoir De Lisle was educated on Jersey, possibly privately, and in 1882 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the 2nd battalion, the Durham light infantry in 1883, joining the battalion at Gibraltar. He served in Egypt in 1885&#150;6 with the mounted infantry of the frontier force, was awarded the DSO (after recommendation for the VC) for his part in the rescue of the garrison of Ambigole Wells Fort in August 1885, and took part in the battle of Giniss in December 1885.<br>
<br>De Lisle rejoined his battalion in India in 1887, and was promoted captain in 1891. An excellent horseman and enthusiastic amateur jockey, he was also a natural all-round athlete and an accomplished big-game hunter. He was the captain of his battalion polo team (1888&#150;98), and has been described as &#145;the inventor of modern polo&#146;  (McGregor, 89) for introducing team training and tactics into the sport. His team regularly won major competitions in India, including the infantry cup (1894&#150;8), the all-India inter-regimental cup (1896&#150;8) and the championship of India (British and Native) (1898), an unprecedented achievement for an infantry regiment.<br>
<br>After attending the Staff College, Camberley, from 1898 to 1899, De Lisle saw active service in the South African War. He first commanded the 6th mounted infantry, and then held various brigade-sized mounted commands far above his substantive rank. He was severely wounded near Venterskroon in August 1900, and was promoted major in 1902. On 16 July 1902 he married, at Stoke Poges church, Leila Annette (<i>d</i>. 1938), eldest daughter and heir of Wilberforce Bryant of Stoke Park, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. They had one son, Christian de Beauvoir. Recognizing De Lisle's abilities as a leader of mounted troops, Field Marshal Lord Roberts arranged his transfer to the cavalry. In 1902 he joined the 5th dragoon guards, and in 1903 the 1st (Royal) Dragoons, which he saw as the family regiment, wrongly believing that his father had served with it in the Crimea. He accompanied the regiment to India in 1903, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel commanding in 1906. He returned to Britain in 1910 to become general staff officer, grade l (GSO1) of the 2nd division at Aldershot, and in 1911 was promoted brigadier-general commanding the 2nd cavalry brigade.<br>
<br>At the start of the First World War, De Lisle took his brigade into action in France as part of the British expeditionary force. He performed well in the retreat from Mons, being promoted to command the 1st cavalry division in October 1914 as a major-general. In June 1915 he was sent to Gallipoli to take the command of the 29th division, and in July was appointed to temporary command of the 9th corps. After the evacuation from Gallipoli he reverted to the command of his division, which under his leadership became known as &#145;The Incomparable 29th&#146;. In early 1916 the division was sent to the western front to take part in the battle of the Somme. It also fought in all the major British battles on the western front in 1917. In March 1918 De Lisle was promoted as an acting lieutenant-general to command the 13th corps, followed by the 15th corps in April, taking part in the battle of the Lys and the Last Hundred Days campaign. Twice he was briefly in acting command of an army.<br>
<br>Following the war Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig obtained De Lisle's final appointment as a substantive lieutenant-general and general officer commanding-in-chief, western command (1919&#150;23), and in 1926 he retired from the army with the rank of full general. He remained much in demand for his polo skills, and spent 1929&#150;30 in India training polo teams for the maharaja of Kashmir.<br>
<br>Despite his very active life De Lisle was also a prolific writer. In addition to his memoirs and two semi-autobiographical books on polo, he also wrote numerous articles on warfare and sport. His unpublished works include detailed accounts of his service in Egypt, the South African War, the First World War, and a semi-autobiographical novel, all preserved in his papers.<br>
<br>De Lisle passed staff college in 1899, was made CB in 1900, KCB in 1917, and KCMG in 1919, and was awarded various foreign decorations. He was colonel of the Durham light infantry (1928&#150;34) and president of the 29th Division Association from 1919 until his death. During his last years De Lisle was virtually confined to his mansion at 34 Hertford Street, Mayfair, London, having gone blind. He died of old age at home on 16 July 1955, and a memorial service was held on 21 July at Christ Church, Down Street, London.<br>
<br>Personally fearless and a devout Christian, De Lisle was regarded by contemporaries as perhaps the best example of the &#145;thruster&#146; or &#145;fighting general&#146; of the First World War. He summed up his own beliefs in 1939 as &#145;Sport and War are closely allied. The man who excels in sport always excels in war. To me both are great games and the greater is War&#146;  (De Lisle, <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Sport and War</span>, 272).<br>
