<span class="headword">Scott, Sir  (Henry) Harold</span>  (1874&#150;1956), <span class="occ">pathologist and historian of tropical medicine</span>, was born on 3 August 1874 at Spalding, Lincolnshire, the son of the Revd Dr Douglas Lee Scott (1846&#150;1914), headmaster of the Mercers' School from 1876 to 1914, and Mary Anne Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Edward Rogers, of Cambridge. He was educated in London at the Mercers' and City of London schools, and afterwards at University College, London, and St Bartholomew's and St Thomas's hospitals, qualifying MRCS, LRCP, in 1897; he then became house physician at the latter hospital. In 1899 he married Harriette (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of the Revd d'Arcy Harrington Preston of Attleborough, Norfolk; they had one son, who died in 1922. In 1934 he married, secondly, Eileen Anne, daughter of the Revd R. P. Prichard, vicar of Wilburton, Isle of Ely.<br>
<br>Scott joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) in 1900 and served with the rank of captain in the South African field force until 1902 (while there he discovered corynebacteria in veld sores); he received the queen's medal with five clasps. During his time in South Africa he contracted enteric fever. Then followed private practice at Ludlow, Shropshire, until in 1910, three years after becoming MD (London), he was appointed government pathologist in Jamaica. There he developed his lifelong interest in tropical medicine, and rightly attributed the local &#145;vomiting-sickness&#146; to the ingestion of unripe ackee fruit (<i>Blighia sapida</i>), and a &#145;central neuritis&#146; (later known as the Strachan&#150;Scott syndrome) to a diet of sugar cane. During the First World War he returned to England, and again served with the RAMC as pathologist to the Cambridge Hospital, Aldershot. Following that he took a Milner research fellowship in comparative pathology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and while there he elucidated (under the direction of R. T. Leiper) the life cycle of the small tapeworm <i>Hymenolepis nana</i>.<br>
<br>In 1922 Scott was appointed pathologist and bacteriologist at Hong Kong (his major research interest here lay in pulmonary tuberculosis); however, after a relatively short spell he developed acute tropical sprue and was invalided home. After his recovery he was appointed pathologist at the Zoological Society of London (where he continued his study of tuberculosis in animals). In 1928 he became secretary of the colonial medical research committee and wrote &#145;Memorandum on medical research in the colonies (protectorates and mandated territories), 1928&#150;30&#146;. In 1930 he was appointed assistant director of the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases, and in 1935 he succeeded Sir Arthur Bagshawe as director; he edited the <span class="italic">Tropical Diseases Bulletin</span>, the <span class="italic">Bulletin of Hygiene</span>, and (for two years) the <span class="italic">Bulletin of War Medicine</span> for the Medical Research Council. After his retirement he continued to contribute to bureau publications.<br>
<br>Scott was a great medical and scientific writer; his works included <span class="italic">Post-Graduate Clinical Studies: for the General Practitioner</span> (1907); <span class="italic">Health Problems of the Empire</span> (with Andrew Balfour, 1924); <span class="italic">Some Notable Epidemics</span> (1934); and, what is generally regarded as his greatest work, <span class="italic">A History of Tropical Medicine</span> (2 vols., 1939); this was based on his two Fitzpatrick lectures to the Royal College of Physicians in 1937&#150;8. He also wrote, jointly with D. T. Richardson, the <span class="italic">British Red Cross Manual of Tropical Hygiene</span> (1946).<br>
<br>Scott was additionally a lecturer on tropical disease at Westminster Hospital medical school, London, and was an examiner for the conjoint and Liverpool diplomas in tropical medicine and hygiene, and tropical hygiene, respectively. He was elected vice-president (1937&#150;9) and president (1943&#150;5) of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; his presidential address was entitled &#145;The influence of the slave-trade in the spread of tropical disease&#146;. He also served as a member of the tropical subcommittee of the Royal Society, and chairman of the Anglo-Soviet Medical Committee. He had been elected FRSE (1917) and FRCP (1925), and was later appointed CMG (1936) and KCMG (1941).<br>
<br>Scott was of slight stature, a good-looking man, always immaculately dressed, who was conservative in outlook and deeply religious, being a devout member of the Church of England. He was above all a classical scholar. He had a keen sense of humour, but could not be described as a clubbable man. He was never pompous. His major relaxation was to be found in books (he read novels, biographies, histories, and travel books, and had a particular fascination with famous trials), though he was also fond of music; he took little exercise and did not play any sport. He read Greek and Latin, and studied Dutch in his seventh decade.<br>
<br>Scott retired from the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases in 1942 and lived quietly thereafter at Braintree, Essex, where he died at his home, Fox Meadows, Courtauld Road, after a long illness, on 6 August 1956.<br>
