<span class="headword">Payne,  Christopher Russell</span>  (1874&#150;1952), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 17 September 1874 at 2 Molesworth Terrace, Stoke Damerel, Devon, the son of the Revd Samuel Ward Payne, then chaplain of HMS <i>Implacable</i>, and his wife, Julia Florence Delmage. Payne joined the <i>Britannia</i> as a cadet in 1888, passed as a midshipman in 1890, was promoted sub-lieutenant in 1893, and lieutenant in 1895. In 1897 he was in the <i>Devastation</i> at Devonport when Captain Henry Bradwardine Jackson (later Sir Henry) was experimenting with wireless telegraphy at the Torpedo School. Payne qualified as a torpedo lieutenant at <i>Vernon</i> in 1899, and was appointed to the torpedo depot ship <i>Vulcan</i>, under Jackson, on the Mediterranean station.<br>
<br>After returning to <i>Vernon</i> to requalify in torpedo duties Payne joined the staff in 1902 as lieutenant in charge of the wireless telegraphy department. In 1903 Payne, Jackson, and F. G. Loring inspected Marconi's new tuned system, recommending an immediate service trial and that all navy ships have three wireless telegraphy ratings in peace and an additional one in war, and emphasizing the role of wireless telegraphy training and practice. From 1903 to 1905 Payne served as torpedo officer in <i>Duncan</i>, again under Jackson, with special wireless telegraphy duties in the Mediterranean and channel. Jackson reported that Payne was &#145;Very zealous and capable in all respects. Has greatly assisted development of W/T. Strongly recommended for early promotion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 196/43, p. 502).<br>
<br>Promoted to commander on 31 December 1905 and appointed to <i>Exmouth</i> for wireless telegraphy duties in the channel, Payne returned yet again to <i>Vernon</i> and was commander in charge of the wireless telegraphy department from 1906 to 1908. He served on the committee on entry and training of operators for wireless telegraphy, which led to the formation of the wireless telegraphy branch in 1907. With Loring he gave evidence to the select committee on the 1906 Radio-Telegraphic Convention. In 1908 he served on the committee on wireless telegraphy codes and ciphers.<br>
<br>Their lordships at the Admiralty expressed their appreciation for good results in wireless telegraphy trials between <i>Vernon</i> and <i>Indomitable</i> and noted Payne's good work with high power stations at Horsea and Gibraltar as commander of <i>Furious</i> (1908&#150;9). But when a court of inquiry into the collision between <i>Crusader</i> and <i>Rother</i> considered he had committed an error in judgement, their lordships expressed displeasure and cautioned him to be more careful. However, he redeemed himself as their lordships conveyed satisfaction with him for designing a mechanism for experiments with submarine A1.<br>
<br>Payne was recognized as a leading naval wireless expert. In 1912 he inspected the Poulsen system of wireless telegraphy between San Francisco and Honolulu, attended the House of Commons Marconi committee, and was recommended for service on the signal committee. Promoted captain on 31 December 1912 and appointed for special service, he visited the Universal Radio Syndicate works in Copenhagen, and was a member of the committee on wireless telegraphy under Sir Henry Jackson.<br>
<br>Payne commanded <i>Vindictive</i> (1913&#150;15), which acted as a wireless relay station during the battle of the Falklands. After command of <i>Celtic</i>, he was appointed head of signal section of the Admiralty war staff in January 1916. When in command of <i>Suffolk</i> (1917&#150;19) he acted as British senior naval officer at Vladivostok in the rank of commodore. He ensured co-operation between the various forces, gaining universal regard for dealing with the political situation.<br>
<br>Created a commander of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1918, Payne was appointed CBE and received the grand order of the Rising Sun in 1919. He was appointed to command <i>Vernon</i> in April 1920 and after two years he was made an aide-de-camp to the king. Payne married late in life at Holy Trinity Church, Brompton, on 2 June 1921 Amy Dorothy Perrot Whinney (<i>b</i>. 1894), daughter of Sir Arthur Whinney (1865&#150;1927), assistant accountant-general of the navy, and Amy Elizabeth Golden. They had four daughters: Julia Elizabeth, Penelope Mary, Diana Rosemary, and Susanna Delmege.<br>
<br>Payne's last command was <i>Malaya</i> from 1922 until his promotion to rear-admiral in 1923; but he was then not further employed and was placed on the retired list in 1925. In 1926 the director of the signal department paid tribute to the work of Jackson and Payne:<blockquote>[they] carried the Navy from the beginning of Wireless Telegraphy through the darkest days to the efficiency of recent times. They never allowed the disheartening effect of failures, and there were many, to delay improvements and advances, and by their persistence and ready help and advice to all W/T enthusiasts under them they brought Naval W/T through the stages of wonder, ridicule, doubt and tolerance to almost its present state of reliability. (TNA: PRO, ADM 116/3403)</blockquote>Promoted vice-admiral on the retired list in 1928, Payne did valuable work for the British Legion, the church, and charities. He died at his home, Copthorne, Dover House Road, Roehampton, of cerebral haemorrhage and arteriosclerosis on Friday 15 February 1952. He was survived by his wife. Gifted with a first-class brain, he proved to be a notable expert in the early days of wireless telegraphy. His exceptional knowledge was put to good use by the signal and torpedo schools and the Admiralty staff.<br>
