<span class="headword">Halliwell,  (Robert James) Leslie</span>  (1929&#150;1989), <span class="occ">film buyer and encyclopaedist</span>, was born on 23 February 1929 in Bolton, Lancashire, the youngest child by thirteen years and only son in the family of three children of James Halliwell, cotton spinner, of Bolton, and his wife, Lily Haslam. He won a scholarship to Bolton School, and after national service in the Royal Army Education Corps he went to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he gained a second class (division 1) in both parts of the English tripos (1951 and 1952).<br>
<br>Leslie Halliwell saw his first film at the age of four, and he spent his childhood going to the cinema, usually in the company of his mother. He claimed that at one time there were forty-seven cinemas within 5 miles of the centre of Bolton, and that he visited them all. At Cambridge, where he was editor of <span class="italic">Varsity</span>, he ran the university film society, and his first job after graduating was working as a journalist on <span class="italic">Picturegoer</span>. At the end of 1952 he took on the job of running two cinemas in Cambridge. In 1956 he became a trainee publicity executive for the Rank Organization in London, moving in 1958 to Southern Television as a film buyer, and in 1959 he joined Granada Television as a film researcher, where he devised the <span class="italic">Cinema</span> series before moving to buy films for Granada from other companies. In 1959 he married Ruth Porter, who had one son and one daughter from her previous marriage. She was the daughter of Samuel Edward Turner, clerk and Baptist minister, of Nottingham. The Halliwells had one son.<br>
<br>In 1968 Halliwell became film buyer for the whole independent television network (ITV), and in 1982 Jeremy Isaacs, head of the new television channel Channel 4, asked him to buy American films for Channel 4 as well. Isaacs described him as &#145;much more than a film buyer. Leslie Halliwell was a film buff, a walking encyclopaedia.&#146; He visited Hollywood twice a year to search in the film libraries. At Channel 4 he was able to help schedule programmes, and he compiled very successful series such as <span class="italic">The British at War</span>, which he introduced himself. While he continued to buy for the other ITV companies, he earmarked interesting discoveries as &#145;obvious Channel 4 material&#146;, and his seasons of &#145;golden oldies&#146;, neglected films from the 1930s and 1940s, were very popular.<br>
<br>Halliwell was best-known for his reference books. <span class="italic">The Filmgoer's Companion</span>, the first comprehensive reference book of the cinema ever published, appeared in 1965, and revised editions appeared regularly thereafter. The first edition of <span class="italic">Halliwell's Film Guide</span>, with synopses and comments on 8000 films, came out in 1977. Revised annually, it had grown to 16,000 entries by the time of the seventh edition in 1988. <span class="italic">Halliwell's Teleguide</span> (later, with Philip Purser, <span class="italic">Halliwell's Television Companion</span>) was first published in 1979.<br>
<br>As well as compiling works of reference, Halliwell wrote about the cinema in such books as <span class="italic">The Clapperboard Book of the Cinema</span> (with G. Murray, 1975) and <span class="italic">Mountain of Dreams: the Golden Years of Paramount</span> (1965). In <span class="italic">Halliwell's Hundred</span> (1982) and its successor <span class="italic">Halliwell's Harvest</span> (1986) he considered some of his favourite films, claiming not that they were the greatest films ever made, or serious works of art, but that they all demonstrated an ability to entertain. In <span class="italic">The Dead that Walk</span> (1986) he wrote about horror films, with essays on films about Dracula, Frankenstein, and mummies, in which he argued that <span class="italic">Bride of Frankenstein</span> (1935) was the best horror film ever released. He also wrote a history of comedy, <span class="italic">Double Take and Fade Away</span> (1987). In the 1980s he published three books of short stories, wrote his autobiography, and also a novel, <span class="italic">Return to Shangri-La</span> (1987), a sequel to one of his favourite films, <span class="italic">Lost Horizon</span> (1937). After his retirement from ITV in 1986 he wrote a weekly television column in the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>.<br>
<br>Halliwell's work was directed at the general public, the middlebrow audience which went to the cinema for entertainment, and not at &#145;the egghead student of film culture who shuns commercial entertainments in favour of middle-European or Oriental masterpieces which never got further than the National Film Theatre&#146;  (L. Halliwell, &#145;Introduction&#146;, <span class="italic">The Filmgoer's Companion</span>, 1965). While he did not ignore foreign films, they did not appeal to him. Brought up in the 1930s and 1940s, he always regarded these years as the golden age of the cinema, the age when films were made in the studio in black and white. He liked very little that was produced after 1950, and lamented the demise of the old studio crafts and film techniques. He found modern films crude and violent, and the language offensive, and he felt that the wit and style of the early movies were lacking. He dedicated <span class="italic">Halliwell's Harvest</span> to the proposition that art should not be despised because it is popular.<br>
<br>Halliwell's most distinctive physical feature was his very long chin, which he later covered with a beard. He died of cancer on 21 January 1989 in the Princess Alice Hospice, Esher, Surrey. At a memorial meeting at the National Film Theatre excerpts from some of his favourite films were shown, including <span class="italic">Citizen Kane</span> (1941), which he regarded as the greatest film ever made.<br>
