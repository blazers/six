<span class="headword">Grandson <span class="st"> [Grandison]</span>, Sir  Otto  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1238&#150;1328), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, was the eldest son of Pierre de Grandson, lord of Grandson, on the shore of Lake Neuch&acirc;tel (now in Switzerland), and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Ulric, count of Neuch&acirc;tel. His move away from the family home and into English affairs resulted from his father's position as the household knight and dependent of Peter of Savoy, earl of Richmond (<i>d</i>. 1268), uncle of Henry III's queen, Eleanor, and a powerful influence at Henry's court. Occasionally in England between <i>c</i>.1245 and his death in 1258, Pierre de Grandson was receiving an annual fee of &pound;20 from Henry by 1249/50, and his son Otto was possibly introduced into the household of Edward, Henry's eldest son and heir, about this time. He first appears, in company with several of Edward's retainers, in October 1265, when he received a grant of confiscated property in London, and by 1268 he was certainly one of Edward's knights. He rapidly became one of the prince's closest friends, accompanying him on his crusade of 1270&#150;72 and appearing as one of his executors in the will that Edward made at Acre in June 1272 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94804', "Lord Edward's crusade")</script>]. When he returned to England as king in 1274 Grandson emerged as &#145;one of Edward's most trusted henchmen&#146;  (Prestwich, 54).<br>
<br>Henceforth Grandson's considerable services to the crown were partly military but mainly diplomatic. He fought as a banneret in the first Welsh war of 1277&#150;8, visited Gascony and Paris on Edward's business in 1278&#150;9, and fought again in the second Welsh war of 1282&#150;3. In March 1284, after its conclusion, he was made justiciar of north Wales. Grandson was essentially viceroy of the newly conquered lands, a position suggestive of the confidence placed in him by Edward; and he may have had some influence, as his Savoyard friends and kinsmen certainly did, on the design of the castles by which Wales was to be held down. In 1286 he joined Edward in Gascony, after an embassy to the papal curia, and in 1289&#150;90 he journeyed once again to the curia to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the granting of a papal dispensation for the marriage of Edward of Caernarfon, Edward's son, to Margaret of Scotland (the Maid of Norway), and Edward's projected crusade.<br>
<br>Although Edward never again went on crusade, Grandson himself led a small expedition to the east in 1290 and was present at the fall of Acre in May 1291. He may have been the author of a memorandum written between 1289 and 1307 concerning plans for a new crusade. After the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle at Acre he retired to Cyprus, whence he visited Armenia and Jerusalem before returning to Grandson and finally to England in 1296. His involvement in the Anglo-Scottish war, then just beginning, followed the pattern of his earlier work for Edward. He was present at the surrender of Dunbar on 28 April 1296, which marked the victorious conclusion of Edward's first campaign, but his main work continued to be high-level diplomacy. He was active in building up Edward's anti-French coalition in the Low Countries in 1296&#150;7, negotiated for a truce with France in 1298, attended the papal curia in 1300&#150;01, helped to settle the terms for a final French peace in 1303, and was among those sent again to the curia by Edward in 1305 to seek the suspension of Robert Winchelsey (<i>d</i>. 1313), archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>Grandson was rewarded by Edward with extensive land grants in England, especially in Kent, and also in Ireland, and in 1275 with the wardenship of the Channel Islands, later transformed into a life grant. This last proved a source of constant conflict and friction with the islanders. After Edward I's death in 1307 he left England for ever, returning to his ancestral home at Grandson. Although he was occasionally called out of retirement to represent English interests at the curia and at the French court, his main interests were now religious. He took the cross again in 1307, and was a notable benefactor to the Franciscans and Carthusians of his homeland. He died in April 1328 and was buried in Lausanne Cathedral. John Grandison, bishop of Exeter (1328&#150;69), was his nephew. It is hard to think of any comparable figure in medieval English history who lived so long, travelled so widely, or had a career so diverse and adventurous.<br>
