<span class="headword">Bargrave,  Isaac</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1586, <em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">dean of Canterbury</span>, was baptized at Bridge, Kent, on 12 June 1586, the sixth son of a yeoman farmer and tanner, Robert Bargrave (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1598), of Bridge, and Joan Gilbert, of Sandwich. He was educated at Cambridge, gaining his BA at Pembroke College in 1607 and proceeding to Clare College for his MA (1610). He was ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough on 10 May 1612 and in October of the same year became rector of Eythorne. However, he maintained his Cambridge connections and played the part of a Portuguese pander in George Ruggle's Latin comedy, <span class="italic">Ignoramus</span>, performed at the university before James I on 8 March 1615.<br>
<br>Between 1616 and 1618 Bargrave served as chaplain to his kinsman Sir Henry Wotton, the English ambassador in Venice, and became intimate with Paolo Sarpi, author of the <span class="italic">History of the Council of Trent</span>, who assured him that &#145;the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England were the most primitive of any in the World&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, BL, MS Lansdowne 985, 9). On his return to England in 1618, bearing a letter of introduction from Wotton to the king, Bargrave's career prospered. One outcome of his stay in Italy was the publication in 1619 of his translation of Fulgenzio Micanzio's revealing description of the government of the Jesuit order; sixty years later this was to be revived by Titus Oates for anti-papal purposes.<br>
<br>In 1622 Bargrave received the degree of DD at Cambridge and was appointed a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral, where his brother-in-law, John Boys, was dean. In the same year he was granted the living of St Margaret's, Westminster, and became chaplain to Prince Charles, an office which he retained after the prince ascended the throne in 1625. On the death of Boys, Bargrave was able to invoke the interest of the duke of Buckingham and succeeded to the deanery of Canterbury, to which he was formally admitted on 16 October 1625. He obtained the vicarage of Tenterden in 1626 and was presented to the benefice of Lydd by &#145;Abbot's collation&#146; in September 1627; he held it for only a few weeks, since William Laud, then bishop of London, succeeded in quashing his admission.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Bargrave's post at Westminster had earned him &#145;great esteem with the Parliament &hellip; who took the sacrament constantly at his hands&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, BL, MS Lansdowne 985, 9). His sermons, of which several were published, displayed a marked independence. In 1623 he suffered royal displeasure for &#145;his sermon before Parliament &hellip; against Papery, Evil Counsellors, and Corruption&#146;  (ibid.). After Charles I's accession, however, he declared himself unflinchingly in favour of the divine right of kings, proclaiming in a sermon of 27 March 1627: &#145;No man hath learn'd to disobey his <i>King</i>, but he had learn'd before to disobey his <i>God</i>&#146;  (Bargrave, 20). As dean of Canterbury he gained a reputation for being &#145;learned and hospitable&#146;  (Walton). He introduced musical and liturgical innovations into the cathedral services, and also put on Latin plays at the deanery. However, his dedication to Anglicanism as a middle way between extremes, and his desire for influence among his Kentish neighbours, disadvantaged him with both sides as the conflict between royalists and puritans became increasingly polarized. Archbishop Laud took the side of the members of the cathedral chapter who complained of Bargrave's partiality in the distribution of patronage. In 1635 Laud also forced a conflict by insisting that the large congregation of French Huguenots worshipping in Canterbury should conform to the ritual of the Church of England. In this case, the dean and chapter combined with the mayor and corporation in resisting the change, but the archbishop could not be dissuaded.<br>
<br>Soon after the opening of the Long Parliament Bargrave faced criticism from its leaders. When the bill for the abolition of deans and chapters was introduced by Sir Edward Dering, a cousin of his wife, Bargrave increased his unpopularity there by going to the House of Commons on 12 May 1641 to present petitions against the bill from the University of Cambridge and from the almsmen, officers, and tenants of Canterbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the civil war, in August 1642, Colonel Edwyn Sandys, one of the rare puritan sympathizers among the Kentish gentry, whom the dean had intervened to save from an indictment for rape in his early life, marched his troop to Canterbury and attacked the deanery. Bargrave was absent, but his wife and children were cruelly treated. On hearing that the dean was at Gravesend, Sandys proceeded there, arrested him, and sent him to the Fleet prison. After three weeks' imprisonment Bargrave was released without having been brought to trial. He returned to Canterbury broken in health, and died at the deanery early in January 1643. He was buried on 25 January 1643 alongside other deans of the period in the chapel of Our Lady Martyrdom in the cathedral. In 1679 a memorial was erected above the grave by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1371/', "John Bargrave")</script> who was vice-dean at the time. The memorial consisted of a portrait of the dean, attributed to Cornelius Johnson, painted on copper, within an elegant marble cartouche that has been attributed to Wren's assistant, Edward Pierce. From Bargrave's marriage in 1618 to Elizabeth (1593&#150;1667), daughter of John Dering, of Egerton, he had two sons and a daughter. Thomas, the eldest, married a niece of Sir Henry Wotton and was an executor of Sir Henry's will. His descendants continued to be lessees of Eastry Court, a former property of the cathedral, until the nineteenth century, when the male line died out. The second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68249/', "Robert Bargrave (1628&#150;1661)")</script>, travelled widely in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.<br>
