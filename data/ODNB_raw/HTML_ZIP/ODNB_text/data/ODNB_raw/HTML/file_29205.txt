<span class="headword">Whiddon,  Jacob</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1595), <span class="occ">sea captain</span>, whose origins are obscure, was by 1578 the master of the <i>Hope of Greenway</i> on the influentially supported but unsuccessful colonizing expedition to Newfoundland headed by Sir Humphrey Gilbert. On 30 January 1584 Sir George Carey, governor of the Isle of Wight, told Sir Francis Walsingham that Whiddon reported great preparation in Lisbon for the fitting out of a large fleet and the collecting of ships in other parts of Portugal and Spain &#145;for the making of the hugest army by sea that ever was set forth by Spain&#146; for the subversion of religion in England  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/167, no. 53). He was captain of Sir Walter Ralegh's ship <i>Roebuck</i> in the fleet commanded by Sir Richard Grenville which sailed from Plymouth on 9 April 1585, but not before privateering a French ship in the channel. Thomas Harriot (<i>c</i>.1560&#150;1621) had tutored Ralegh's sea captains at Durham House in mathematics and navigation and went on this voyage, recording the findings memorably in <span class="italic">A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land</span> (1588). In June 1586 Ralegh sent out from Plymouth two privateers, the <i>Serpent</i> and the <i>Mary Sparke</i>, under Whiddon's command and they took prizes including three Portuguese ships.<br>
<br>Famously, Whiddon took the <i>Roebuck</i> against the Armada and was used by Drake to escort into Torbay his prize, the <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario</i>, the crippled flagship of Don Pedro de Vald&eacute;s. The lords lieutenant of Devon took all the shot and powder out of Vald&eacute;s's ship and sent it to the navy, as well as a piece of ordnance; Whiddon appears to have rustled out of the galleon nine or ten other pieces of ordnance, a quantity of muskets and calivers, and fourteen or fifteen coffers containing cloth of gold and other rich furniture. In 1589 the States complained that the <i>Roebuck</i> had taken from a ship of Holland bound for London four butts of sack, and in March it took into Plymouth the <i>Angel Gabriel</i> of Holland returning from Spain; goods worth over &pound;1000 were seized. About the same time, the <i>Roebuck</i> took goods belonging to merchants of the United Provinces from a Hamburg ship.<br>
<br>In 1590 Whiddon was captain of the <i>Pilgrim</i> which took a prize of &pound;500. In 1591 he served gallantly in the assault by Spanish ships on the <i>Revenge</i> off the Azores and stayed all night to help Grenville, escaping in the morning when he was being &#145;hunted like a hare amongst many ravenous hounds&#146;  (Hakluyt, 7.44). In 1594, when Whiddon was arrested at the suit of Dutch merchants, Sir Robert Cecil wrote to the judges of the admiralty court requesting his prompt release, &#145;for I assure you it concerns Sir Walter Ralegh very near&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 158, fol. 395). For Ralegh was sending Whiddon to explore the River Orinoco and its tributaries in Guiana in the search for El Dorado. In preparation, Thomas Harriot had provided Ralegh's ships with new tables from observations of the pole star and sun and laid down rules for the use of the improved instruments of his devising  (BL, Add. MS 6788, fols. 468&#150;492). Whiddon's journey had no very promising outcome. After receiving him with apparent amity, the governor of Trinidad treacherously ambushed eight of his men when Whiddon left temporarily to see a sister ship, the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i>. Meeting many other unexpected impediments, Whiddon returned home.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Ralegh sailed for Guiana early in 1595. Arriving at Trinidad on 22 March, he sent Whiddon to speak with the Spaniards who kept guard at Port of Spain and gather information about Guiana. Ralegh secured his base on the island by firing the Spanish settlement at San Josef and capturing the governor, Antonio de Berreo. He put to death all the Spaniards he caught, but spared Berreo and his second in command for the intelligence which they might provide. Once in Guiana, Whiddon and the ship's surgeon went to discover what they could by land when floods prevented Ralegh entering the River Caroli by water; they brought him stones like sapphires, and upon his return to England in August 1595 he declared the empire of Guiana would afford queen and country &#145;no less quantities of treasure, than the King of Spain hath in all the Indies, east or west&#146;  (Hakluyt, 10.351). Whiddon, however, had died in Trinidad on the journey home; Ralegh declared him &#145;a man most honest and valiant&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
