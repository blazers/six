<span class="headword">Sedbergh,  Adam</span>  (<em>c.</em>1502&#150;1537), <span class="occ">abbot of Jervaulx</span>, was, as a Cistercian monk, ordained subdeacon at York on 22 September 1526, deacon on 6 April 1527, and priest on 15 June. These dates suggest that he was born about 1502. When still a young man, in or about 1533, he succeeded Robert Thornton as abbot, and almost immediately found himself involved in high politics. On the visit of Sir Francis Bigod and Dr Thomas Garret to the abbey, on 11 July 1535, George Lasynby interrupted Garret's sermon in justification of the royal supremacy to assert that the headship of the church belonged to the pope alone. Sedbergh joined with Bigod in denouncing Lasynby to Cromwell, and the monk was subsequently tried for treason at the York assizes in August and executed.<br>
<br>Sedbergh emerged unscathed from this encounter, only to succumb the following year. On 11 October 1536, soon after the outbreak of the Pilgrimage of Grace in the East Riding, insurgents arrived at Jervaulx demanding to see him. With his own father and a boy, Sedbergh fled to Witton Fell and remained there for four days. In his absence the rebels tried to persuade the convent to elect a new abbot, and in this extremity the monks prevailed upon him to return. Threatened with death by the rebels, Sedbergh took their oath and went with them to the great muster at Darlington where he spoke in favour of the rising. While the royal pardon might have extended to the abbot's behaviour in the first half of the pilgrimage, it could not save him from his actions early in the new year, when in February local agitators tried again to raise the commons and came to Jervaulx for a second time. On this occasion, before seeking refuge in Bolton Castle he gave them money for drink, and passed them on for a further reward to the quondam abbot of Fountains, then resident in the abbey. Once he had defeated the rebels Norfolk dispatched Sedbergh and the quondam of Fountains to London, where they were tried on a charge of treason, condemned, and put to death on 26 May 1537. On account of the abbot's attainder, Jervaulx Abbey and all its possessions reverted to the crown.<br>
