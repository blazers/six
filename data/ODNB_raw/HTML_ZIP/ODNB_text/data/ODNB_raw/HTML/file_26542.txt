<span class="headword">Stockdale,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1749&#150;1814), <span class="occ">publisher and bookseller</span>, was born in Cumberland, the son of Priscilla Stockdale (1723?&#150;1789); his father is unknown. He reputedly trained as a blacksmith before becoming valet to John Astley of Dukinfield, Cheshire. It was probably during this period of his life that he married Mary Ridgway from Longdendale in Cheshire, the sister of James Ridgway, a well-known London publisher. Stockdale moved to London about 1780 and was employed by the bookseller and radical publisher John Almon, at his shop in Piccadilly near to that of his brother-in-law. When Almon retired in 1781 and his business was taken over by John Debrett, Stockdale set up a rival shop in a neighbouring building. Like that of Debrett, Stockdale's bookshop was reputed to be a fashionable lounging place; however, while Debrett was patronised by whigs, Pitt's supporters preferred to visit Stockdale's establishment. John Stockdale was described as &#145;a man of strong natural parts &hellip; [who] soon became conspicuous in his business, in spite of much eccentricity of conduct, and great coarseness of manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 85/1, 1815, 649).<br>
<br>Stockdale was a prolific publisher, particularly in the 1780s and 1790s. In 1781 he took over the <span class="italic">London Courant</span> newspaper. His other publications included Ferguson's <span class="italic">Roman Republic</span> (1783), the <span class="italic">Debates of Parliament</span> (1784&#150;90), Dr Johnson's works in 1787, an edition of <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1795), and numerous others including topographical and cartographical items and music imprints. Stockdale was indicted for a libel on the House of Commons after publishing John Logan's <span class="italic">Review of the Charges Against Warren Hastings</span> in 1788, which it was claimed was intended to vilify the Commons as corrupt and unjust in its impeachment of Hastings. Stockdale was ably defended by Erskine, who argued that the defendant should not be judged by isolated passages, but by the entire context of the publication and its general character and objects. Stockdale was acquitted in December 1789 in a case which was said to have been instrumental in the passing of Fox's <span class="roman">Libel Act</span> of 1792. Stockdale was again accused of libel in 1809 by Joseph Nightingale. This time he was not so fortunate and was fined &pound;200.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his career Stockdale dealt largely in remainders (the surplus stock of other publishers), and his use of auctions to sell large numbers of such books was supposed to have made him unpopular with other traders. Although Stockdale had acquired significant property in his earlier years as a bookseller, he was less successful later on in life and one obituarist blamed his death on 21 June 1814 on his being forced to deal with his creditors and arrange payment of his debts.<br>
<br>Three of Stockdale's children followed him into the publishing business. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_26542"></a><span class="headword">John Joseph Stockdale</span>  (1776/7&#150;1847)<span class="occ"></span>, was a freeman of the Stationers' Company from 1802, ran a shop in Pall Mall between 1807 and 1822, and published a large number of books, including the notorious <span class="italic">Memoirs of Harriette Wilson</span> in 1825, which was reported to have attracted crowds of buyers ten deep to his shop. John Joseph Stockdale was also involved in a complicated and protracted libel action between 1836 and 1840 when he charged the Commons' printers, Hansard, after the publication of a report of the inspectors of prisons which accused Stockdale of publishing an obscene and indecent book which prisoners had been found reading. Stockdale was eventually defeated. He died at The Slad, Bushey, Hertfordshire, on 16 February 1847, after two years of paralysis.<br>
<br>Like her brother and father, John Stockdale's daughter, Mary R. Stockdale, was a London bookseller and ran a shop on Piccadilly between 1816 and 1833. She was also a poet, and published several volumes of her poetry as well as translating the works of others. Her brother, William Stockdale, one of John Stockdale's younger sons, also ran a shop on Piccadilly from 1817 to 1823.<br>
