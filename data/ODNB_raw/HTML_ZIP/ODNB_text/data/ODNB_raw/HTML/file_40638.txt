<span class="headword">Swinney,  Sidney</span>  (1721&#150;1783), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Pontefract, Yorkshire, one of the five children of the Irish soldier Major Matthew Swinney (<i>b</i>. 1681) and Mary Kitchingham. Little is known of his family history and early life. He was educated at Eton College and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he received a BA in 1744, an MA in 1749, and a DD in 1763. Drawn towards a religious life, he was ordained a priest of the Church of England on 22 September 1745 and became curate of Swillington, Yorkshire, in the same year. Matthew Swinney had enjoyed a distinguished military career, and as a reward for his services his son Sidney was granted a chaplaincy in the British army. Swinney served as chaplain during the Seven Years' War (1756&#150;63), participating in the British army's campaigns in Germany.<br>
<br>Swinney was an accomplished classical scholar, with a keen interest in ancient art and archaeology, which inspired him to travel widely in Europe and the Near East. He lived in Constantinople for several years, serving as chaplain to the British embassy. During his travels and residence in Constantinople, Swinney gathered an impressive collection of classical coins and other artefacts. In 1769 he published an account of an expedition through Asia Minor to examine the sites of the earliest Christian churches, <span class="italic">A Tour through some Parts of the Levant</span>, which combined his archaeological and religious interests. In recognition of his contribution to the study of classical culture, he was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1764 and fellow of the Antiquarian Society in 1767.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Swinney acquired a respected reputation as a poet, publishing translations of classical poetry, occasional verse, songs, and epigrams in periodicals and newspapers. In 1767 he published an imitation of Horace's ninth satire. Many of Swinney's miscellaneous works were collected and reprinted as <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces</span> (3rd edn, 1768). His most ambitious work was an epic poem celebrating the British victory over the French at the battle of Minden (1759) during the Seven Years' War. Although the first two books of the projected three-book epic were printed in 1769 and 1772 respectively, it appears that Swinney never finished the work. In the preface to the 1772 edition of <span class="italic">The Battle of Minden</span>, he explained that a four-year illness had delayed the composition of the second book, and perhaps recurring ill health prevented the poem's completion. Of little literary originality or merit, <span class="italic">The Battle of Minden</span> nevertheless represents a historically valuable firsthand account of the war in Germany written by an experienced, astute observer. Swinney was also a gifted preacher and published two sermons. He became rector of Barton-le-Street about 1775.<br>
<br>Swinney died at Scarborough, Yorkshire, on 12 November 1783. Reflecting upon his character and conscientiousness as a pastor, a correspondent in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> praised him as a &#145;gentleman of uncommon generosity and benevolence&#146;.<br>
