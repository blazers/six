<span class="headword">Delaune,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was born at Brinny in co. Cork, Ireland. His parents were poor Roman Catholics who rented a farm from Major Edward Riggs, a wealthy Cromwellian soldier who had settled on a large estate about 7 miles from the town of Cork in 1651 and who also had a partnership in a nearby fishery. Riggs, who was the founder of Cork Baptist Church, was sufficiently impressed with Delaune's intellectual giftedness that he provided for his education until Delaune was about sixteen. The young Catholic became a Baptist largely through the influence of Riggs. For several years Delaune was the clerk of a pilchard fishery near Kinsale, which may very well have been the one in which Riggs had a share. Delaune's embrace of protestantism, though, brought upon him obloquy from his Catholic neighbours and this eventually compelled him to settle in England.<br>
<br>Not long after his arrival Delaune made the acquaintance of Edward Hutchinson, a Baptist minister with experience in Ireland, whose daughter Hanna he subsequently married. The couple made their home in London, where Delaune provided a livelihood for his family by keeping a grammar school and publishing religious works. A number of theological tracts and treatises came from his pen during the 1670s and early 1680s. Some of them took up the defence of Baptist principles against various paedobaptist authors, including the prominent nonconformist Richard Baxter. Delaune was clearly highly regarded by the leadership of the London Particular Baptist community. In July 1675, for instance, he co-authored a book with Hanserd Knollys, William Kiffin, and three others that defended believers' baptism. Six years later Delaune and Benjamin Keach co-authored the monumental <span class="italic">Tropologia: a Key to Open Scripture Metaphors</span> (1682), which sought to give the interpreter of scripture a solid grasp of the various tropes, metaphors, and similes in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. In it Keach owned his debt of gratitude to Delaune, whom he called his &#145;Friend&#146;, for the work was far &#145;too heavy for a single Undertaker&#146;  (foreword, <span class="italic">Tropologia</span>, book 2). It is clear from <span class="italic">Tropologia</span> that Delaune was fully conversant with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, and that he had read widely in classical authors such as Virgil and Pliny the younger, a number of church fathers including Tertullian and Gregory of Nazianzus, and various Reformed divines. By his own admission, he was never ordained.<br>
<br>Other writings, better known, defended nonconformity. Delaune's <span class="italic">A Plea for the Non-Conformists</span> (1683) was issued in response to a sermon by the Anglican minister Benjamin Calamy about the &#145;scrupulous conscience&#146; of dissent. Calamy maintained that dissenters had no just cause to separate from the Church of England. In fact, he argued, their separation was about &#145;mere niceties&#146; and thus their &#145;wayward skittish Consciences ought to be well bridled and restrained&#146;  (B. Calamy, <span class="italic">A Discourse about a Scrupulous Conscience</span>, 1683). In response Delaune's tract argued that the dissenters had as much reason to separate from the Church of England as the latter did from Rome. Moreover, they did not separate over trivial matters, but profound spiritual issues. Delaune also defended religious toleration. &#145;I cannot find&#146;, he wrote, &#145;that Christ or his disciples, ever &hellip; <i>Newgated</i> scrupulous consciences to conformity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plea</span>, pt 3). Convinced that <span class="italic">A Plea</span> &#145;contained things dangerous to the government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Plea</span>, pt 3), government authorities ordered Delaune's arrest on 29 November 1683. He was tried in January 1684 at the Old Bailey on a charge of sedition and found guilty, despite the fact that nothing seditious had been said in his book. He was fined 100 marks (just under &pound;67), but because he was unable to pay he was kept in Newgate prison. Delaune's books were also publicly burnt in front of the Royal Exchange, London. His wife and two children soon joined him in prison. The utterly miserable conditions in the prison broke their health and the entire family perished there, Delaune dying last, in 1685.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Tropologia</span> and Delaune's <span class="italic">Plea</span> were the two literary pieces by which posterity would remember Delaune. The <span class="italic">Plea</span> became something of a standard nonconformist apology, reprinted up to the beginning of the nineteenth century. Daniel Defoe, who wrote the preface to a 1706 edition, noted something of the irony in this: surely, he asked, the dissenters, whose &#145;champion&#146; Delaune was, could have raised the money to have paid his fine and thus freed him.<br>
