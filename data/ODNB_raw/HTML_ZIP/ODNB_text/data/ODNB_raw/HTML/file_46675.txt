<span class="headword">Cecil <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cooke]</span>,  Mildred</span>, Lady Burghley  (1526&#150;1589), <span class="occ">noblewoman and scholar</span>, was born in 1526, the eldest of five daughters and four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke (1505/6&#150;1576)")</script>, Edward VI's tutor, of Gidea Hall in Essex, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1553), daughter of Sir William Fitzwilliam of Milton, Northamptonshire, and Gaynes Park, Essex. She was educated at home by her father, himself a noted scholar. As well as undergoing a classical education equal to that offered to boys, she developed a long-lasting commitment to the puritan leanings of her father.<br>
<br>Mildred Cooke married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4983/', "William Cecil")</script> as his second wife in December 1545, bringing with her important kinship links. Her first child was not born until nine years after her marriage, although she was involved in the upbringing of her stepson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4981/', "Thomas Cecil")</script>. In total she had five children, of whom only <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4980/', "Robert Cecil")</script> was still living at the time of her own death. There is little direct evidence of her role in the household or her relationship with her children apart from what can be deduced from William Cecil's writings after her death, where he refers to strong affective ties. According to his eulogy on her monument in Westminster Abbey, Mildred was &#145;dearest above all&#146; and &#145;far beyond the race of womankind&#146;. For her part Mildred Cecil in a letter wrote of her happiness and &#145;everlasting comfort &hellip; living with this noble man in divine love and charity&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 104, fol. 158<i>r</i>). Writing to his son Robert, William Cecil refers to &#145;the virtuous inclinations of thy matchless mother, by whose tender and godly care thy infancy was governed, together with thy education under so zealous and excellent a tutor&#146;  (Wright, 9).<br>
<br>Wimbledon Manor was the chief home of the Cecils for ten years after 1550. Cecil continually added to the family property, buying land and building a great house in the Strand and subsequently further houses in the country. The household governed by Mildred Cecil was substantial, numbering at least fifty people, and grew in size as William Cecil became more significant politically; he was ennobled as Baron Burghley in 1571. The Cecils obtained several wardships, and a number of young men whose families sought advancement and connections for them were sent to live in the Burghley household. In addition, they were joined by the three daughters of the unhappy marriage of the Cecils' daughter Anne to Edward de Vere, earl of Oxford, after their father rejected them.<br>
<br>As Burghley's wife, Mildred Cecil was in a key position to exercise influence. She was known to have acted as an intermediary between petitioners and her husband, receiving at least one substantial payment of &pound;250 in 1580. Her importance to her husband can be seen in letters to her in 1560 from three of the Scottish leaders negotiating the treaty of Edinburgh, including William Maitland, Lord Lethington. Cecil was urging the queen against her inclinations to commit herself to military involvement in Scotland. The letters were couched in terms indicating that Mildred Cecil had a considerable knowledge of the issues under discussion and could influence her husband in the attempt to secure English support against the French presence in Scotland. These political skills can be seen again in a single letter of advice, written in Latin and dating from 1573, to her cousin William Fitzwilliam, the lord deputy of Ireland. The letter demonstrates that Mildred Cecil was not afraid to give advice even on public affairs at a high level.<br>
<br>By reputation among her contemporaries Mildred Cecil was supremely well educated. Strype later said she spoke Greek as easily as she spoke English, and she received three dedications of books. However, she left few manuscripts; those that do exist confirm her reputation for scholarship, revealing her fluency in both Greek and Latin and her interest in classical and religious authors. She made several lengthy translations including a sermon of Basil the Great from the Greek. Her preface reveals an appreciation of the art of translation while at the same time presenting the conventional modesty of intention. In a letter to the fellows of St John's College, Cambridge, written in Greek, she appears at ease, referring with gratitude to the hospitality she received on a visit with her husband and her desire to mark the occasion with an appropriate gift: the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> she presented in 1580. Ballard adds that she also sent an epistle in Greek, written in her own hand. Having inherited only three books from her father, over a number of years Mildred Cecil built up an impressive library mainly in Latin and Greek; some thirty volumes still exist inscribed with her name. The titles indicate the breadth of her intellectual interests and the depth of her scholarship, covering medical texts, literature, history, religious commentaries, and church fathers; many of them were printed abroad. Seventeen of her books in Latin, Greek, French, and English remain at Hatfield House, which became her son's property. Lady Burghley was the owner of one of the finest private libraries of the day.<br>
<br>Mildred Cecil died at Cecil House in the Strand on 4 April 1589. Evidence of the extent of her concerns can be seen in the disposal of her property. She made a number of charitable bequests at her death, as well as gifts of books and money during her lifetime. Many of these she concealed even from her family by the use of intermediaries such as Dean Goodman of Westminster; in 1579 two scholarships were granted to St John's College, Cambridge, in this way. A number of gifts were structured in an attempt to create work. For example, in 1583 wool and flax were provided for the poor women of Cheshunt to process, and in 1586 she funded a scheme through the Haberdashers' Guild to provide loans for tradesmen. She also made more conventional donations, including provisions and money to the poor in Cheshunt. Mildred Cecil gave careful thought to the disposal of her library and divided her books between a number of institutions. In addition to her gift of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to St John's, Cambridge, in 1587 she gave Christ Church, Oxford, eight volumes of Galen's works: three in Latin and five in Greek. She also gave two books each to St John's College, Oxford, and to Westminster School.<br>
<br>After Mildred Cecil's death, Lord Burghley arranged an impressive funeral involving 315 mourners as &#145;a testimony of my harty love which I did beare hir, with whom I lyved in the state of matrimony forty and tow yers contynually without any unkyndnes&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 103, fol. 167<i>r</i>). A further indication of Burghley's devotion to his wife and their unfortunate daughter Anne can be seen in his joint memorial to them in the chapel of St Nicholas at Westminster Abbey. It is a substantial monument, containing more than the usual effigies; a lengthy eulogy testifies to the importance of his wife to him.<br>
