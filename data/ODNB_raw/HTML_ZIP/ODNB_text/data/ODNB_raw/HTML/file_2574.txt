<span class="headword">Blair,  William</span>  (1766&#150;1822), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, youngest son of William Blair, surgeon, and Ann Gideon, his wife, was born at Lavenham in Suffolk on 28 January 1766. Educated for the church Blair changed direction to study under John Pearson, surgeon, of Golden Square, London. In 1788 he passed the diploma for membership of the Company of Surgeons, which became the Royal College of Surgeons in 1800; he also took an MA degree at Aberdeen, and at some point married. He was made assistant surgeon to the London Lock Hospital in 1802, and he had appointments to the Finsbury and the Bloomsbury dispensaries in Great Russell Street, the Female Penitentiary in Pentonville, and the New Rupture Society. He was a member of medical societies in London, Paris, Brussels, and Aberdeen. For a time he edited the <span class="italic">London Medical Review and Magazine</span>. In 1803 he recommenced his series of physiological lectures, illustrated with anatomical preparations, addressed to the nobility and clergy, and to painters, sculptors, and others. He published his syllabus as <span class="italic">Anthropology, or, The natural history of man; with a comparative view of the structure and function of animated beings in general</span> (1803). The lectures, started &#145;as occasional amusement to a few friends&#146;, had grown imperceptibly &#145;into the mature state of regular and annual discourses&#146;  (Blair, preface).<br>
<br>Blair's other works included: <span class="italic">The Soldier's Friend, or, The Means of Preserving the Health of Military Men</span> (1798); <span class="italic">Essays on the Venereal Disease and its Concomitant Affections, in Two Parts</span> (1798&#150;1800); and <span class="italic">The Vaccine Contest respecting Cow-Pox Inoculation &hellip; for the Use of Clergymen, Heads of Families, Guardians, etc.</span> (1806). In this and other publications Blair defended vaccination, mentioning a report of the Royal Jennerian Society and abuse at the London Smallpox Hospital. His <span class="italic">Prostitutes Reclaimed and Penitents Protected, being an Answer to some Objections against the Female Penitentiary</span> appeared in 1809. This and subsequent publications debated the rehabilitation of prostitutes after care of their venereal infections. Blair's <span class="italic">Correspondence on the Formation, Objects, and Plan of the Roman Catholic Bible Society</span> (1814) drew him into a controversy with Charles Butler of Lincoln's Inn  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 84/2, 1814).<br>
<br>Blair also wrote a long and elaborate article entitled &#145;Cipher&#146;, in the eighth volume of Abraham Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (1819); three engraved illustrative plates are inserted under the heading &#145;Writing by cipher&#146; in the fourth volume of plates (1820). This article was considered the best treatise in the English language on secret writing and the art of deciphering. It included a cipher method invented by Blair, which he declared to be inscrutable; but the key was discovered in 1819 by Michael Gage, who commented that Blair's method was a real improvement on previous ciphers and the first method ever published on a scientific principle. In addition Blair was the author of the article &#145;Stenography&#146; in Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (vol. 34, 1819, 12), discussing the origins and history of shorthand.<br>
<br>Blair was a very earnest Methodist and worked enthusiastically in the cause of the British and Foreign Bible Society, on whose committee he served and to which he presented his valuable collection of rare editions of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. After his wife's death, on 1 March 1822, he gave up his practice to retire to the country. However, before the preparations for moving to the Colchester area were completed, he died at his residence in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, London, on 6 December 1822. He left no children.<br>
