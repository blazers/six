<span class="headword">Reibey,  Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Molly Haydock; <em>alias </em>James Burrow]</span>  (1777&#150;1855), <span class="occ">businesswoman in Australia</span>, was born on 12 May 1777 at Bury, Lancashire, the daughter of James Haydock (<i>d</i>. 1779), a yeoman, and his wife, Jane Law. Orphaned, and brought up by a grandmother, she was intelligent and literate, and was educated possibly at the free grammar school, Blackburn. On 18 August 1791, dressed as a boy and known by the name of James Burrow, she was arrested for attempting to sell a stolen horse. Her reckless role-play was perhaps rendered plausible by a snub nose and lively brown eyes, and Burrow was duly sentenced at Stafford summer assizes before Haydock's identity was discovered. She was committed to seven years' transportation.<br>
<br>Molly Haydock arrived at Sydney, New South Wales, aboard the <i>Royal Admiral</i> on 7 October 1792, optimistic, and pledged &#145;to make myself as happy as I Can in my Pressent and unhappy situation&#146;  (Haydock to Mrs Hope, 8 Oct 1792, Reibey MSS). Her immediate fate was to sew garments for the government. On 1 September 1794 she married Thomas Reibey (1769?&#150;1811), a merchant seaman turned settler. Thomas qualified for a 30 acre grant at Mulgrave Place, an agricultural settlement on the Hawkesbury River, where their first child was born in May 1796. Besides farming profitably, Reibey carried grain to Sydney and shipped timber and coal along the New South Wales coastline. With a partner, Edward Wills, he later engaged in sealing and trading with the Pacific islands. The growing family moved to Sydney, where at Entally House, their fine home-cum-warehouse, Mary Reibey supervised the sale of merchandise and acquired a hotel licence.<br>
<br>In 1811, shortly after returning with a cargo from India, Thomas died; Wills died a month later. Thomas had named Mary his sole administrator, &#145;well-knowing and confiding in the natural Love and Affection which she beareth unto her Children, and the steadfast assurance which he hath that she will always do the best in her power to provide for their future Welfare&#146;  (Thomas Reibey's will 1811, probates, Supreme Court of NSW, Sydney). Now the mother of seven children (the youngest barely twelve months old), Mary Reibey inherited control of an enterprise that included shipping, farms, and houses. Untypically she did not remarry, but advanced into the capricious frontier economy with assurance. In 1812 she opened a new warehouse in a premier position, and within five years had two ships plying to Van Diemen's Land (where she settled three sons and which later became the family base). She also proved equal to the problem of debt collection endemic in the colony: in May 1817 she was found guilty of assault, having taken her umbrella to a recalcitrant debtor. Her established reputation for &#145;strictest propriety&#146; and increasingly respectable social status remained unaffected, and were reinforced by the favour of the governor, Lachlan Macquarie.<br>
<br>After failing to find buyers for her assets, generally estimated at over &pound;20,000, Mary Reibey decided in 1820 that her annual rent roll of &pound;1205 would support a voyage to Britain with two of her daughters. In London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh they enjoyed the fashionable sights and entertainments, though, especially at Manchester and Liverpool, Mary Reibey visited factories and warehouses. At her childhood home in Lancashire she was relieved and gratified to meet with consideration and warm hospitality. Back in London, she discussed the future of &#145;our Colony&#146; with others anxiously waiting for signs of political reaction to the reports of Commissioner Bigge.<br>
<br>During the colonial boom of the 1820s Mary Reibey invested afresh, building and renting high-class property in Sydney and continuing to add to her landholdings, but by 1845 she found herself burdened by &#145;bereavements and embarrassments&#146;, and having to exercise &#145;the greatest prudence and economy&#146;  (Reibey to D. Hope, 20 June 1845, Reibey MSS). A governor of the free grammar school, she had a genuine interest in education, charity, and her Anglican faith. Survived by three of her daughters, whose provision in her will she specified &#145;shall be free from the &hellip; control of &hellip; Husbands&#146;, Mary Reibey died on 30 May 1855 at Newtown, Sydney, and was buried at Old George Street burying-ground. Disarming in lace cap and pince-nez, an unlikely confidante of sea captains and men of affairs, this small nonconformist remains one of Australia's most original capitalists: fittingly, her portrait appeared on the commonwealth of Australia $20 note from 1994.<br>
