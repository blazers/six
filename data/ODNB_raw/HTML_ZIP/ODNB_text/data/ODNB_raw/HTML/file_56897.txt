<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Daniell]</span>,  Emily Hilda</span>  (1880&#150;1949), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 21 March 1880 at Whitley, Northumberland, the fourth of the seven children of William Michael Young, shipowner, and Frances Jane Young, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Venning, of Cornwall. She was educated at Gateshead high school and Penrhos College, Colwyn Bay, Wales. An accomplished rock climber, she returned on holiday to north Wales many times.<br>
<br>In 1902 Young married John A. H. Daniell (1874&#150;1917), a Bristol solicitor. He was killed at Ypres in 1917. The Clifton landscape, though it was Young's home for only sixteen years, became the setting (fictionalized as Radstowe) for all but three of her eleven novels. During these years Young read classical and modern philosophy and prepared for her vocation by writing fortnightly essays. During the First World War she worked as a stables groom and then in a munitions factory; in the Second World War she was active in air raid precautions.<br>
<br>Through her husband Young met Ralph B. Henderson (1880&#150;1958), headmaster of Alleyn's School in Dulwich, London. After Daniell's death, Young moved to Sydenham Hill, London, to live with Henderson as his lover, in the same house with his wife. Upon his retirement, Henderson and Young moved to Prior's Close, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, where they lived until Young's death. Henderson encouraged Young to write and watched the growth of her work &#145;from the first word written to the last word printed&#146;  (Henderson).<br>
<br>For some years Young left the house every morning to write in the drawing-room of a nearby friend. The routine included a mid-morning coffee break with her friend, but Young never discussed the progress of her work. Her antipathy to publicity seems to have been lifelong; throughout her career she maintained that her works must stand on their own merits or not at all.<br>
<br>Between 1910 and 1947 Young published eleven novels, several short stories, and two children's books; she published as E. H. Young. Several of her novels were later dramatized as radio plays. The beloved Clifton landscape&#151;the placid downs leading to steep cliffs, the dramatic gorge and suspension bridge over the Avon River, and the Somerset country on the far side of the bridge&#151;became a favourite symbol for the duality of her characters. For example, in <span class="italic">The Misses Mallett</span> (1922) (originally titled <span class="italic">The Bridge Dividing</span>) and in <span class="italic">Miss Mole</span> (1930), which was awarded the James Tait Black memorial prize, the country both reflects and complements the characters' natures, inspiring confidence in a natural order, instilling in them a sense of rootedness, and offering them a release from the restrictions of societal structures.<br>
<br>How this natural heritage can be integrated into the social order of the town is a question raised by many of the novels, frequently manifested as a conflict between a convention-bound character and one who searches for truth independently of societal codes. Notably in <span class="italic">The Vicar's Daughter</span> (1928) and in <span class="italic">Miss Mole</span>, characters' preoccupation with female chastity and with sexual transgression gives rise to evasion and misunderstanding, but also to self-examination and growth. Young handles these themes in a tone of fundamental seriousness leavened with humour. Characteristically, her sentences embody an ironic vision; for example, a clergyman in <span class="italic">The Vicar's Daughter</span> is &#145;conscious that his calling set him apart from other men and losing, in the consciousness, what might have been the power of his position&#146;.<br>
<br>Some contemporary reviewers compared Young to Jane Austen. In the words of one: &#145;she wisely narrows her field, and within her limits she excels all her competitors because she does not allow her brain to override her heart&#146;  (Mais, 148). Young's novels demonstrate that the domestic realm can be the source of experience as significant as the public sphere: &#145;here, in little, were most of the emotions, preoccupations and duties common to mankind&#146;  (E. H. Young, <span class="italic">Celia</span>, 1937). Young's philosophical perspective manifests itself in the human questions her characters address: What is beauty and how is it related to good? How ought we to act if we cannot foresee the consequences of our actions?<br>
<br>Young modernized the domestic novel by writing frankly about marital discord in <span class="italic">William</span> (1925), the most successful of her novels; <span class="italic">The Curate's Wife</span> (1934); <span class="italic">Celia</span>; and <span class="italic">Chatterton Square</span> (1947), her patriotic final novel invoking the domestic realm to reflect on and respond to the Munich agreement. Another mark of her modernity is her focus on the complexity of characters' internal responses to events.<br>
<br>Throughout her life, E. H. Young's remarkable qualities commanded admiration and love. &#145;She was quite the most observant person I've ever met&#146;, said a friend. Another observed her transforming influence on those she met even casually. She died of lung cancer on 8 August 1949 at Prior's Close.<br>
