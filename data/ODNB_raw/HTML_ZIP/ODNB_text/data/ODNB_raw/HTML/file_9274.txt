<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Felton,  Nicholas</span>  (1556&#150;1626), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely</span>, was one of three sons of John Felton, merchant of Great Yarmouth (<i>d</i>. 1602). Admitted to Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1577, he later moved to Pembroke College, where he became a fellow in 1583 and Greek lecturer in 1586. He proceeded BA in 1581, MA in 1584, BTh in 1591, and DTh in 1602. On 15 August 1589 he was ordained deacon and priest by Bishop John Howland of Peterborough, and preferments in London soon followed. He was collated to the rectory of St Antholin, Budge Row, by the dean and chapter of St Paul's on 18 April 1592, and later to that of St Mary-le-Bow by Archbishop John Whitgift on 17 January 1596; he retained both livings until his elevation to the episcopate in 1617. About 1591 Felton married Elizabeth, widow of Robert Norgate (<i>d</i>. 1587), master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and they had three sons, John (<i>b</i>. and <i>d</i>. 1592), Nicholas, and Robert; the latter two followed him to Pembroke and eventually into the ministry. His wife was to predecease him by twenty years, being buried in St Antholin's on 9 January 1606.<br>
<br>Though Felton published nothing in his lifetime, eight manuscript sermons of his survive, probably transcribed by Edmund Willis, a pioneer in shorthand who stated in 1618 that &#145;for the space of many yeeres&#146; he had practised the technique by noting Felton's sermons  (Willis, sig. A<i>r</i>). The sermons (Senate House Library, University of London, Carleton MS box 17/8) were preached at St Mary-le-Bow and St Antholin's between 1599 and 1606. They deal with uncontroversial Christian themes such as conscience, prayer, and charity, though at one point Felton urged his auditory &#145;with patience [to] enduer and suffer scandales in the Church and not make rents and divisions for them&#146;  (Felton, &#145;Certaine Sermons&#146;), a light rebuke to puritans and separatists. There are also notes of a sermon Felton delivered in 1616 at the funeral of his fellow collegian and intimate friend Roger Fenton, rector of St Stephen Walbrook, in which he observed that Pembroke College had never produced &#145;a more learned [man] than this: except one&#146;, a compliment to the distinguished scholar Lancelot Andrewes  (CUL, MS Dd.5.31, fol. 186<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Felton was probably chaplain to Elizabeth I from the 1590s, and retained his chaplaincy under James I, preaching at the Lenten court sermons between 1606 and 1608. In 1612 Bishop Andrewes, former master of Pembroke College and an ally, learned from Felton that the current master, Samuel Harsnett, was thinking of resigning in favour of Thomas Murriell, whom Andrewes regarded as unsuitable, and he wrote in support of Felton's candidacy, adding that &#145;his Majestie hath formerly ben pleased to signifie his good lyking of him and to wish him some preferment&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/70/15). In the event Harsnett did not resign until 1616, whereupon, backed by the king's recommendation, Felton was elected his successor on 5 July. He appointed the young and energetic Matthew Wren as his president, and a period of administrative reform began in the college. Meanwhile Felton continued to acquire further preferment: in 1616 Bishop John King of London collated him to a canonry in St Paul's, and Lord Knyvet of Escrick presented him to the living of Great Easton in Essex; he was also briefly vicar of Blagdon, Somerset, resigning the living in 1618. Finally, and probably with the backing of George Villiers, newly created earl of Buckingham, Felton won the see of Bristol, and was consecrated at Lambeth on 14 December 1617. Immediately he was in the hunt for a richer bishopric, being mentioned as a candidate for Lincoln and then Salisbury, but in the end succeeded Andrewes as bishop of Ely on 11 March 1619, having resigned as master of Pembroke on 9 February.<br>
<br>There are few signs that Felton was an energetic diocesan: though the records are sparse for his brief time at Bristol, fuller sources at Ely indicate that Felton resided in London for most of each year, though he had no court duties to detain him there, and failed to attend any of his three diocesan visitations, though he did return to Ely during the summer months of most years. There he is known to have occasionally attended the county assizes and the sewers commission, necessary duties in view of his extensive temporal powers as bishop. In London Felton lived at Ely House, though he was temporarily obliged to give it up first for the Spanish ambassador and then for the duke of Richmond, a sign of his minor status at court.<br>
<br>Felton's theology and churchmanship are hard to establish with any precision. He moved among a circle of evangelically minded bishops, such as Archbishop George Abbot of Canterbury and bishops John King of London and Arthur Lake of Bath and Wells, the latter a close friend whose last confession Felton heard in May 1626. His posthumous reputation was as a dedicated preacher and &#145;very hospitable to all, and charitable to the poor&#146;  (Fuller, sig. Sfff<i>v</i>). Among his chaplains was the future bishop Ralph Brownrig, but also, according to Anthony Wood, the puritan George Walker, and Felton was in addition an early patron of the future presbyterian Edmund Calamy. In 1624, moreover, Felton secured the vacant lectureship of Holy Trinity, Cambridge, for John Preston, the godly master of Emmanuel College, in the face of some opposition at court, though Felton proceeded cautiously, emphasized Preston's &#145;professions of all conformitie&#146;, and was encouraged by assurances from the secretary of state Sir Edward Conway that &#145;his Majestie wilbe farre from taking ill his admittance to that lecture but will approve it and take it well&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/70/58, 164/39). Felton died in London on 5 October 1626 and was buried the next day under the communion table in St Antholin's. Under his will he left bequests to his family, including his poor kindred at Yarmouth, and &pound;5 each to twenty poor beneficed ministers in London.<br>
