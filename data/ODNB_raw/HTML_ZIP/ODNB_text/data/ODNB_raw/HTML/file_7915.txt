<span class="headword">Douglas,  Robert</span>, Viscount Belhaven  (1573/4&#150;1639), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the third son of Malcolm Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1585) of Mains, Dunbartonshire, and his wife, Janet, daughter of John Cunninghame of Drumquassle. His father was executed at Edinburgh Cross on 9 February 1585 for his alleged complicity in the plot of the banished lords to assassinate James VI. Having been page of honour to Prince Henry, he later became his master of horse. He was knighted by the king on 7 February 1609. On 12 January 1611 he married at St Mary Woolnoth, London, Nicola, the eldest daughter of Robert Moray of Abercairny. She died in November 1612 giving birth to their only child, who did not survive.<br>
<br>Following the death of Prince Henry the same month, Sir Robert was appointed one of the king's gentlemen of the bedchamber, and his wealth and standing increased. He had charters of an annual rent out of the lordship of Torthorwald (3 June 1613 and 11 September 1617) and Carlyle (3 June 1613), as well as the lands of Spott and the office of chamberlain (1622) and baillie of the lordship of Dunbar, which were united into the free barony of Spott (24 April 1624). In 1631 he also acquired a charter of annual rent of lands in the Dunbar lordship. Douglas continued as a gentleman of the bedchamber under Charles I and was appointed master of the household. However, Sir Archibald Primrose related to Gilbert Burnet a story which, if true, indicated that Douglas might be ruthless in opposing royal policy. When in the third year of Charles's reign Robert Maxwell, earl of Nithsdale, arrived in Scotland with a commission for the resumption of church lands and tithes, the interested parties agreed in Edinburgh, &#145;if no other argument did prevail to make the earl of Nithisdale desist, they would fall upon him and all his party in the old Scotish manner, and knock them on the head&#146;. Douglas, who was blind, asked to be placed next to one of the commissioners to &#145;make sure of&#146; him. Sitting with the earl of Dumfries, &#145;he was all the while holding him fast&#146;, an action he put down, when challenged, to his blindness, but &#145;he had all the while a poinard in his other hand, with which he had certainly stabbed Dumfrize, if any disorder had happened&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.36&#150;7). Nithsdale and his party were duly intimidated, and temporarily abandoned their mission.<br>
<br>In the long term Douglas's career was not adversely affected. On 5 July 1631 he was admitted to the Scottish privy council. He was one of the many aspirants who were raised to the Scottish peerage during the period of the king's coronation visit to Scotland, being on 24 June 1633 created Viscount Belhaven in the county of Haddington. That he was a favourite of Charles I is apparent from the report of Sir Robert Pye in 1637, in which it is stated that Belhaven had:<blockquote>received out of the exchequer since his majesty's accession, besides his pension of 666<i>l</i>. 13<i>s</i>. 14<i>d</i>. per annum and his fee for keeping his majesty's house and park at Richmond, 7000<i>l</i>. by virtue of two privy seals, one, dated 5 Aug 1625, being for 2000<i>l</i>. for acceptable services done to his majesty, and the other, dated 25 June 1630, for 5000<i>l</i>. in consideration of long and acceptable services. (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1637</i>, 130)</blockquote>On 22 September 1638 Belhaven signed the &#145;king's covenant&#146;, a royally approved alternative to the national covenant, in the presence of the Scottish privy council, and was appointed to superintend its subscription in the sheriffdom of Renfrew. Belhaven died at Edinburgh on 12 January 1639 and was buried in the abbey church of Holyrood, where a monument to him was erected by his nephews, Sir Archibald and Sir Robert Douglas. Since Belhaven was childless, the viscountcy became extinct.<br>
