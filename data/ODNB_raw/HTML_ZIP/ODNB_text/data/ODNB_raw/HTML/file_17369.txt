<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McCabe,  Edward</span>  (1816&#150;1885), <span class="occ">cardinal and Roman Catholic archbishop of Dublin</span>, born at Dublin on 14 February 1816, was the son of poor parents. He was educated at Father Michael Doyle's school at Arran Quay, Dublin. In 1833 he entered St Patrick's College, Maynooth, where he was ordained on 24 June 1839. He was for some time curate at Clontarf, co. Dublin, and then transferred to the pro-cathedral parish of Dublin. Daniel Murray and his successor to the archbishopric, Paul Cullen, recognized his organizing talent; he was appointed a canon in 1855 and he refused a nomination to the bishopric of Grahamstown, Cape Colony, in the same year. In 1856 Cullen appointed him parish priest of St Nicholas Without, and he was promoted to the post of vicar-general of the archdiocese. His health gave way under the strain of work, and in 1865 he was removed to the parish of Kingstown (D&uacute;n Laoghaire). There he built a new church at Monkstown and opened a local hospital. In 1872 he drew up the address given by the Catholics of the archdiocese of Dublin in answer to the remarks of William Nicholas Keogh, the judge in the celebrated Galway election case. As Cardinal Cullen was becoming infirm, McCabe was on 25 July 1877 consecrated bishop of Gadara <i>in partibus infidelium</i>, and appointed as his auxiliary. After Cullen's death in 1878, McCabe became archbishop of Dublin on 23 March 1879. He at once issued a circular calling attention to the position of Irish Roman Catholics with regard to university education  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 April 1879). He was installed as archbishop on 4 May 1879, and on 12 March 1882 was created a cardinal.<br>
<br>In his politics McCabe was opposed to the campaign for home rule and land reform led by Charles Stewart Parnell and Michael Davitt. Though aware of the plight of tenant farmers and appalled by wholesale evictions, he had sympathy for the economic difficulties facing landlords. He regularly condemned agrarian outrages and in October 1881 issued a pastoral letter denouncing in fierce terms the Land League's &#145;no rent&#146; manifesto. McCabe zealously sought to keep priests from engaging in political agitation. All of this left him isolated among his fellow prelates and increasingly alienated from the generality of Irish nationalist opinion. So great was his unpopularity that his return from Rome in 1882 with the red hat passed almost unnoticed in his native city, and on one occasion his life was threatened. He was a member of the senate of the Royal University of Ireland, and served in 1880 on the Mansion House committee in Dublin for the relief of famine throughout Ireland. Sandwiched between the reigns of Cullen and Walsh, two giant figures in ecclesiastical and political spheres in nineteenth-century Ireland, McCabe's period as archbishop might be dismissed as a mere interlude were it not for the eventful times in which he lived. None the less, he enjoyed the confidence of the papacy at a time when Anglo-Vatican relations were undergoing a temporary thaw. He was also the last archbishop of Dublin to be made a cardinal. Plagued by ill health during the latter part of his administration, McCabe died at his home in Eblana Avenue, Kingstown, on 11 February 1885 and was the first archbishop of Dublin to be buried at Glasnevin.<br>
