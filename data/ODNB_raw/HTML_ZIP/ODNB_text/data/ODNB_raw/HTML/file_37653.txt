<span class="headword">Lanier <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bassano]</span>,  Emilia</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1569, <em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized in St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, on 27 January 1569, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70536/', "Baptista Bassano (d. 1576)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70535/', "Bassano, Alvise")</script>], court musician, and his &#145;reputed wife&#146;, Margaret Johnson (<i>d</i>. 1587). The Bassanos were a family of Italian Jews, &eacute;migr&eacute;s from Venice who came to be musicians and instrument makers at court in 1531. Giovanni Baptista Bassano lived near the Charterhouse but Emilia was brought up by Susan, dowager countess of Kent, whom she addresses as the &#145;noble guide of my ungoverned dayes&#146;. Although we know nothing specific of her education, Emilia writes that the countess was &#145;directed&#146; by a mother famed for her furtherance of protestant and humanist learning, Catharine Bertie, dowager duchess of Suffolk, and we may suppose that more than usual attention was paid to her reading.<br>
<br>We learn from a visit Emilia made to Simon Forman, astrologer, in 1597 that she had been a favourite at the court of Elizabeth, had become mistress of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4649/', "Henry Carey, first Baron Hunsdon (1526&#150;1596)")</script>, and had been &#145;maintained in great pomp&#146; until 1592, when, having become pregnant, she was married to Captain Alphonso Lanier (<i>d</i>. 1613) of the other leading family of court musicians, the Laniers, who moved to London from Rouen in 1561.<br>
<br>Though Emilia Lanier's outstanding achievement is undoubtedly the composition of the first original poetry by a woman to be published in the seventeenth century&#151;a volume of religious verse entitled <span class="italic">Salve Deus rex Judaeorum</span> (1611)&#151;she has become notorious as a result of attempts to identify her as the &#145;dark lady&#146; of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Sonnets</span> (1609), on the conjectural grounds of her racial colouring, musical ability, and promiscuity. Although there is insufficient evidence to establish the identification it illustrates a tendency that, interestingly, her own poetry strives to overcome&#151;that is, the tendency to read a woman's emergence into the sphere of public discourse as a form of indecency, signalling promiscuity. The central poem of her volume, which celebrates the &#145;worthy mind&#146; of her patron Margaret, dowager countess of Cumberland, is remarkable for managing to avoid identifying female virtue with chastity, articulating in its place a feminine mastery of those dialectical skills that constituted the humanist ideal of masculine virtue. The volume concludes with the first country-house poem published in English, an encomium of an estate at Cookham occupied by the countess, in which the passing of the seasons suggests the ephemerality of patronage relations; the walks bear &#145;summer Liveries&#146;, and the prospect of hills and vales appears to &#145;preferre some strange unlook'd for sute&#146; only as long as their mistress is in residence.<br>
<br>The ambiguity of an elegy that laments the loss of constancy in relations between household and patron, yet offers itself in the public market place as a suit for favour, aptly characterizes the circumstances of Emilia Lanier's life, for court musicians were at once household servants and courtiers, suitors for office. As well as inheriting stipends and liveries Bassanos and Laniers competed among themselves for patents and privileges. From the first Emilia occupied the position of a precariously privileged dependant, and complained of &#145;hard fortune&#146;, her father having died when she was a child, leaving a &#145;miserable&#146; estate. Though she brought a substantial dowry in money and jewels to Alphonso Lanier this was soon exhausted by his service in hope of preferment under Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. He did, however, receive in 1612 (delayed from 1603) a lucrative patent for the weighing of hay and straw but on his death in 1613 Emilia surrendered the patent to an enterprising brother-in-law, Innocent Lanier.<br>
<br>Consequently Emilia Lanier was again in financial difficulties, in 1617, when she unsuccessfully attempted to set up a school in St Giles-in-the-Fields for the education of children of the nobility. When her son Henry, another court musician, died in 1633 his widow petitioned to get their four-year-old son, Henry, trained in music &#145;as soon as he shall be capable thereof&#146;. In the meantime Emilia Lanier tried to provide means for this grandson and his sister, Mary, by claiming in chancery heritable rights in the patent for the weighing of hay and straw. The privy council finally ruled in her favour in 1637. Emilia Lanier was buried in St James's, Clerkenwell, Middlesex, on 3 April 1645.<br>
