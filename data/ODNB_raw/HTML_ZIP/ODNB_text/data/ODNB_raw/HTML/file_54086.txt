<span class="headword">Sturge,  Sophia</span>  (1849&#150;1936), <span class="occ">peace campaigner</span>, was born in Birmingham, on 5 January 1849, the second of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26746/', "Joseph Sturge (1793&#150;1859)")</script>, corn merchant, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55214/', "Hannah Sturge (1816&#150;1896)")</script>, daughter of Barnard Dickinson, ironmaster of Coalbrookdale, and his wife, Ann. The two families were members of the Society of Friends. Joseph Sturge was a well-known philanthropist, and Sophia was brought up in an atmosphere of strenuous piety and community service. After her education at home by governesses she embarked on a lifelong career of philanthropy and reform. At a time when women were claiming a share in public life she served as president of the Young British Women's Temperance Association and as a member of the Women's Liberal Social Council. From the 1860s she supported the women's suffrage campaign. Deeply moved by the sufferings of the Irish people, she sympathized with Irish home rule and went to Connemara in 1888, where, with financial assistance from some Quakers, she set up a basket-making industry in the village of Letterfrack. She lived there for seven years, pursuing this venture with great energy. Subsequently, in Ireland and the Scottish highlands, she attempted to set up cottage industries for making toys. As an authority on handicrafts she was consulted by the congested districts boards in Scotland and Ireland. Hoping to diminish unemployment and urban destitution in England, she was also associated with the land settlement schemes of Joseph Fels, an American philanthropist.<br>
<br>Sophia Sturge's sympathies recognized no frontiers: from her parents she had inherited business-cum-philanthropic interests in the Caribbean island of Montserrat, and in her own right she supported reforms promoted by the early Indian National Congress. By the turn of the century world peace had become her chief interest. A strong believer in international arbitration, she attended peace conferences in Boston and Stockholm in 1904 and 1910. She opposed the South African War and assisted Norman Angell's peace campaign. In July and August 1914 she worked strenuously for the Neutrality League which attempted to keep Britain out of the First World War. Putting the strength of her convictions to severe tests during the war years, she not only pressed for a negotiated peace but also assisted enemy aliens in Britain through the Friends Emergency Committee and attempted to ameliorate the harsh treatment of conscientious objectors. After the war she went to the Netherlands where she helped German children to recuperate from their hardships. During the 1920s she promoted peace by participating in the conferences of the Union of Democratic Control and by travelling throughout Britain to address schoolchildren. Her published works were primarily directed to young people in the hope of fostering international understanding: they included books on Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway; a tale called <span class="italic">The Patriot</span> (1909); and <span class="italic">The Children of Hunger</span>, a collection of children's letters from Germany and Austria written in the aftermath of the First World War.<br>
<br>Sophia Sturge never married; she lived in the parental home at Wheeleys Road, Edgbaston, until her mother's death, when, with her brother and sisters, she moved to 318 Hagley Road, Edgbaston. Later she moved to nearby Frederick Road. She lived frugally, but her home was always a base for her public life where she entertained local and international visitors. Vehement, even importunate, in pursuit of her good causes, she cultivated an impressive presentation of self. She was remembered as a &#145;beautiful tall lady&#146;  (Hughes 181) who dressed in a blue cloak (the colour of peace) with flowing draperies in the style of Elizabeth Fry. Her attitude to Quakerism was ambivalent: loyal to her parents' example, as a young woman she was none the less alienated by what she saw as restrictive Quaker customs and became a member of the Church of England. However, she resumed her Quakerism before her death. She died on 17 January 1936 at 39 Frederick Road and was buried on 21 January at Lodge Hill cemetery, Selly Oak, Birmingham. The registered cause of death was dermatitis herpetiformis and chronic rheumatism.<br>
