<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lewis,  Samuel</span>  (1838&#150;1901), <span class="occ">moneylender and philanthropist</span>, was born on 14 May 1838 at 1 Lower Hurst Street, Birmingham, the elder of the two children of Frederick Lewis (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1801), a dealer, and his wife, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1805&#150;1872). They lived in impoverished slum conditions, and in 1841 his father was imprisoned for debt. On this, and on many other occasions, the family were rescued by benefits provided by the Birmingham Hebrew Philanthropic Society.<br>
<br>By 1851 Lewis's father had left his mother; Sam, as he was commonly known, became, at the age of thirteen, her sole support. Promising to send her &pound;1 a week, he travelled around the Birmingham area as a pedlar, with a tray round his neck and a stock of cheap jewellery and steel pen nibs. After early struggles, he was well established as a travelling jeweller by 1867. In that year, on 14 August, he married Ada Davis (1844&#150;1906) of Dublin, the third daughter (of ten children) of an Orthodox Jewish middle-class family, and the couple went to London, where Lewis hoped to advance his career as a jeweller. The marriage, which endured until Lewis's death, was happy but childless.<br>
<br>In 1869 Lewis changed his occupation: taking premises at 17 Cork Street, Mayfair, he became a moneylender. It was a propitious time to start, as the usury laws had been repealed in 1854 and were not restored until 1900. During the intervening years moneylenders had an almost free rein. Lewis sought the landed aristocracy as his clientele. The agricultural recession in the last quarter of the nineteenth century led to diminishing incomes from land, and the increasing cost of hunting, shooting, fishing, and servants, and particularly of the London season, combined to create a high demand for loans.<br>
<br>Lewis was intelligent, witty, and shrewd, a humorous raconteur, and, though short of stature, an imposing and engaging personality. He was a good judge of character, his mind having been well honed from his days on the road. He kept himself abreast of the latest political and social gossip, was a well-known figure in racing circles, and thoroughly researched the background of his potential clients. When they entered his office he knew almost as much about them and their finances as they did themselves, and was able accurately to gauge the risk of a loan.<br>
<br>From granting unsecured loans to prodigal sons at high rates of interest, Lewis rapidly progressed to entering into large transactions, on security, at rates competitive with the banks and insurance companies. With the unexpected backing of the Bank of England, he soon became recognized as the leading moneylender to the aristocracy of England. He took speedy decisions, was prepared to make higher advances on the security offered than banks would, was discreet, and his word was his bond. His terms were clearly stated, and he gained the respect, and even the friendship, of his clients, most of whom would have been astonished had they known his origins. He was fair with defaulters. &#145;I have never&#146;, he claimed, &#145;foreclosed upon an honest man&#146;  (R. D. Blumenfeld, <span class="italic">R. D. B.'s Diary 1887&#150;1914</span>, 1930). But those able to pay, who sought to avoid payment, were pursued through the courts, and Lewis was involved in several colourful cases, both civil and criminal.<br>
<br>Lewis's clients included the eighth duke of Beaufort; several members of the exclusive Jockey Club; the second Viscount Esher, a power behind the throne and government and adviser to royalty and prime ministers, but none the less a frequent visitor to Cork Street; the fifth earl of Lonsdale, one of England's wealthiest men, but often short of cash; the fourth marquess of Ailesbury, whose financial depredations almost brought his family to ruins; and England's premier earl, the twentieth earl of Shrewsbury, who found it cheaper to borrow &pound;367,000 from Lewis than from banks and insurance companies.<br>
<br>Moneylenders have rarely been popular; in the 1880s and 1890s they were increasingly reviled and attacked&#151;in the courts, in the press, and in a select committee of the House of Commons which sat in 1897. As England's best-known moneylender, Lewis was a prime target. He attracted the relentless enmity&#151;not reciprocated by him&#151;of Sir George Lewis (1833&#150;1911), England's foremost society solicitor, who believed that borrowing from moneylenders at high interest led to crime and disgrace, and who campaigned for the revival of the usury laws. He harried Sam Lewis relentlessly, but unsuccessfully, throughout the whole of the latter's career. In a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 22 March 1898 he branded him &#145;a curse to society and a danger to the community&#146;, and invited a writ for libel, an invitation Lewis declined. Sam Lewis not only survived, unscathed, all the attacks upon him, but, if anything, emerged with his reputation enhanced.<br>
<br>Society imposed boundaries beyond which a Jewish moneylender could not infiltrate, but, despite Sir George's efforts, Sam and Ada Lewis, with homes in Grosvenor Square, by Boulter's Lock in Maidenhead, and on the front at Brighton, mixed freely with their many high-placed friends, entertained generously, and were part of the daily parade in Hyde Park.<br>
<br>Within a few months of his retirement, Sam Lewis died, on 13 January 1901 at 23 Grosvenor Square. He was buried on 16 January 1901 at Golders Green Jewish cemetery. He left an estate of &pound;2.6 million. Ada Lewis (who in 1904 married as her second husband an army officer more than thirty years her junior) left an estate of &pound;1.1 million at her death in 1906. Between them, the Lewises bequeathed more than &pound;3.4 million to fifty-one charities, mainly for cheap housing for the working classes, to voluntary hospitals in London, Brighton, and Maidenhead, and to trust funds established for the poor of Dublin and of the City of London. Asked what he would choose as a motto, Lewis, a latter-day Robin Hood, replied, &#145;I lend to the Lords; I give to the poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 14 Jan 1901).<br>
