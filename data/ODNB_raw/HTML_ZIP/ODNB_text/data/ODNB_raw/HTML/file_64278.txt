<span class="headword">Donaldson,  Alexander</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1727, <em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">bookseller and printer</span>, was baptized in Edinburgh on 24 November 1727, the second son of James Donaldson (1694&#150;1754), a wealthy linen manufacturer who served as the town's treasurer in 1726&#150;7, and Elizabeth Weir (<i>d</i>. 1768). His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7798/', "Captain James Donaldson (d. 1719)")</script> had published the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Gazette</span> from 1699 to 1707. Alexander later stated that he &#145;embarked in the trade and business of a bookseller in the year 1750 at Edinburgh&#146;  (Skinner, 4), although he is identified as the publisher of a three-volume Edinburgh reprint of Joseph Hall's <span class="italic">Contemplations</span>, dated 1749. He became a burgess and guild brother of the city by right of his father on 29 August 1750. On 10 January 1751 he married Anna Marshall or Merchall (<i>bap</i>. 1726, <i>d</i>. 1792), a merchant's daughter, with whom he had three sons, but only the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7800/', "James Donaldson (1751&#150;1830)")</script>, printer and founder of Donaldson's Hospital, survived childhood. On 4 December 1751 Donaldson became a one-third seat-holder at the prestigious New Kirk in St Giles Church, and on 23 June 1752 he joined masonic lodge Canongate Kilwinning no. 2.<br>
<br>The period from the early 1750s to the mid-1760s was marked by a series of bookselling and printing partnerships in Edinburgh. From 1751 until May 1758 Donaldson was the junior partner of one of Edinburgh's most prominent booksellers, Alexander Kincaid (1710&#150;1777). On their own and in collaboration with Andrew Millar of London, Kincaid and Donaldson published several new books of philosophy and medicine by Scottish authors, including Francis Home, Henry Home (later Lord Kames), James Lind, and David Hume, and from 1753 until 1784 Donaldson's name was included in the imprint of every edition of Hume's most important collection of philosophical writings, <span class="italic">Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects</span>. They also began reprinting English literature, such as the two-volume duodecimo edition of John Milton's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> that appeared in 1755. Donaldson subsequently became the fourth partner in the firm which printed that work, and from 1756 to 1760 items &#145;printed by Sands, Donaldson, Murray, and Cochran&#146; were common. In August 1760 he entered into a printing partnership with John Reid that was dissolved on 11 November 1765, after which Donaldson retained the large printing house he had acquired on the south side of Castlehill and sued Reid for embezzling his books.<br>
<br>After leaving Kincaid, Donaldson expanded his literary reprinting business, taking Alexander Pope's head as the sign of his bookshop. By the early 1760s it was the meeting place for young Scots with literary ambitions, such as James Boswell and Andrew Erskine, who lionized &#145;that seat of learning and genius, Mr Alexander Donaldson's shop&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's General Correspondence</span>, 3 Dec 1761), and its owner, &#145;the great Donaldson&#146;  (ibid., 8 Dec 1761), in correspondence published in 1763 as <span class="italic">Letters between the Hon. Andrew Erskine and James Boswell, esq.</span> Boswell describes Donaldson in his harvest jaunt journal as &#145;a man of uncommon activity and enterprise in Business, who has a smattering of humour and a tollerable Address&#146; and &#145;entertains like a Prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's London Journal</span>, 27 Oct 1762), which he could well afford to do as a result of a &pound;10,000 inheritance from his father. The entertaining was done in Donaldson's spacious house in the West Bow. The second volume of Donaldson's <span class="italic">Collection of Original Poems</span> by &#145;Scotch Gentlemen&#146; (1760&#150;62) provided Boswell and Erskine with a much appreciated outlet for their juvenile poetry, and accounts for Boswell's dubbing him &#145;the imperial sovereign of Pope's Head, Caledonian Dodsley, Scottish Baskerville, and captain-general of collective bards&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's General Correspondence</span>, 2 Dec 1761). Although Donaldson published other new books in various fields, he had little to do with publishing new works by Scottish Enlightenment authors after the dissolution of his partnership with Kincaid.<br>
<br>Donaldson moved to London by early April 1763. He initially joined with his brother John (<i>b</i>. 1729) at 195 Strand, at the corner of Arundel Street (sometimes identified as &#145;near Norfolk-street&#146;), but imprints continued to advertise both London and Edinburgh branches of the business. Although John claimed in an advertisement of 1774 to have been selling books at the same address since 1 October 1756, it was the arrival of Alexander, armed with his cheap Edinburgh reprints, that transformed 195 Strand into the notorious &#145;shop for cheap books&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's London Journal</span>, 13 May 1763). On 24 June 1773 the partnership was dissolved &#145;by mutual consent&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span>, 9 Aug 1773), with John staying at 195 Strand and Alexander moving to larger quarters at 48 St Paul's Churchyard, where he remained until the late 1780s. The reasons for the dissolution of the brothers' partnership remain a mystery, but from the mid-1770s onwards imprints stating &#145;printed for John Donaldson&#146; became increasingly common, at times outpacing Alexander's own. Both men issued catalogues to promote their books. In Edinburgh, with Kincaid and on his own, Alexander had used catalogues in a conventional manner to announce the sale or auction of a special collection of books, usually for a limited time, but in London he adopted a more brazen approach, as in his 1774 circular <span class="italic">Books Sold Cheap</span>, which announces prices &#145;thirty to fifty <i>per cent</i> cheaper than the usual London prices&#146; on his basic stock, and editorializes about his philosophy of bookselling.<br>
<br>Donaldson's invasion of the London market brought to a head an ongoing struggle between the leading London booksellers, who claimed their copyrights in perpetuity, and the majority of the Scottish book trade, who believed that copyrights were limited to the maximum term of twenty-eight years set down in the statute of Queen Anne, dating from 1710. After April 1763 the copyright debate often centred on the motives and character of Donaldson himself. In a confrontation on 20 July 1763 with the Scottish MP George Dempster, who asserted that Donaldson's aim was to make books affordable to the poor, Samuel Johnson was &#145;loud and violent against Mr Donaldson&#146; and said he was, at best, &#145;no better than Robin Hood&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.438&#150;9). Donaldson was criticized in the press for sacrificing quality for the sake of price, as in the attack on his edition of Pope's Homer for its &#145;incorrectness and mutilations&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Chronicle</span>, 8&#150;10 March 1774). He was also taken to court: eleven suits in chancery court and one in the Scottish court of session since 1763, according to a petition that Donaldson submitted to both houses of parliament in spring 1774. There, as well as in the anonymous pamphlet that he published, and allegedly wrote, in 1764 under the title <span class="italic">Some Thoughts on the State of Literary Property</span>, he consistently presented himself as the enemy of monopoly and its harmful effects on &#145;the advancement of learning&#146;  (p. 7), who had been obliged &#145;to struggle with the united force of almost all the eminent booksellers of London and Westminster&#146;, to incur &#145;heavy expense&#146;, and to suffer &#145;much trouble and anxiety&#146; in the name of &#145;the general right to supply the community at large with books at a moderate price&#146;  (Donaldson, &#145;Petition&#146;).<br>
<br>At first the legal skirmishing went badly, especially when the Donaldson brothers were slapped with a perpetual injunction in <i>Becket v. Donaldson</i> in November 1772 for printing a cheap edition of James Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> in Edinburgh (&#145;printed by A. Donaldson&#146;). But then Alexander and two others won an important challenge before the Scottish court of session in July 1773, and that case paved the way for the Donaldsons' decisive victory in <i>Donaldson v. Becket</i> on 22 February 1774, when the House of Lords overturned the injunction against <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> on appeal, putting an end to the legal fiction of perpetual copyright and confirming the modern concept of limited, statutory copyright. When word of this decision reached Edinburgh there was public rejoicing, and the book trade drank a toast to the Donaldson brothers &#145;for having the courage to stand forth in the cause of liberty, against a most powerful combination&#146;  (<span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>, 2 March 1774). Alexander's petition was submitted to the House of Commons on 3 May in an unsuccessful effort to turn that body against the so-called <span class="roman">Booksellers' Bill</span>, which sought to provide relief to the owners of literary property by adding another fourteen years to the term of existing copyrights. The petition was also read a month later in the House of Lords, where it may have helped to quash the bill.<br>
<br>Despite his emigration to London, Donaldson remained closely connected to the Edinburgh book trade. In January 1764 he founded a bi-weekly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Advertiser</span>, which was taken over by his son James ten years later and survived until 1859. A series of Edinburgh lawsuits during the 1760s demonstrates Donaldson's continuing business interests there, and an incident in May 1769, when he had a chest containing &#145;eight or ten thousand guineas&#146;  (Somerville, 162) transported from London to the Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh, shows the scale of his London profits as well as where the money was going. From 1773 onwards he seems to have surrendered most of his printing work to James, and from the middle of the next decade the number of imprints stating &#145;printed for&#146; or &#145;sold by&#146; A. Donaldson diminished to a trickle. The last one appeared in 1789, the year in which he retired to Broughton Hall on the outskirts of Edinburgh, which he had purchased in June 1786. Donaldson died there on 11 March 1794 and was buried three days later in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh, having bequeathed to his son an estate worth about &pound;100,000.<br>
