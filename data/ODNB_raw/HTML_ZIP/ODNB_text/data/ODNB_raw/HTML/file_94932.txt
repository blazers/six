<span class="headword">Ballinger <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hodgson]</span>,  (Violet) Margaret Livingstone</span>  (1894&#150;1980), <span class="occ">university teacher and politician in South Africa</span>, was born at 4 Waverley Terrace, Glasgow, on 11 January 1894, the third of four children born to John Hodgson (1860&#150;1927), a commercial traveller, and his wife, Lillias Robertson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burt (1863&#150;1927). Little is known about her parents or her early childhood. In 1896 or 1897 her father became a citizen of the Orange Free State republic. During the South African War (1899&#150;1902) he fought in the Irish brigade for the Boers. Only in 1904 did his family join him in South Africa, where they settled in Port Elizabeth. Here Margaret Hodgson completed her high school education at the Holy Rosary convent in 1910. After preparing for the intermediate examination of the University of the Cape of Good Hope at the Huguenot College, Wellington, she enrolled in 1912 at the Rhodes University College in Grahamstown for a BA degree. Her first-class pass earned her the Queen Victoria scholarship to further her studies at Somerville College, Oxford, in 1914. After gaining second-class honours in modern history, she returned to South Africa in 1917 to lecture at Rhodes University College, and from 1920 at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.<br>
<br>Hodgson grew up in a politically conscious home supportive of liberalism. It was, however, her association with the well-known liberal historian W. M. Macmillan, first as a student at Rhodes and then as a colleague at the University of the Witwatersrand, that had the strongest influence on her political ideas and approach. Like Macmillan she believed that segregation was impracticable in South Africa because of the inextricable intertwining of black and white interests. Apart from that, she believed that segregation, and later apartheid, simply meant the unjust domination of the black majority by the white minority and that enforced segregation led to racial tension and hatred. She argued that blacks should be systematically involved in all aspects of society, without being subjected to forced integration, and insisted that the colour-blind qualified franchise of Cape Province be extended to the rest of South Africa.<br>
<br>Hodgson believed that liberals should not just be intellectually involved in South Africa's problems but should take a clear political position, and use political action to enforce reform. As a result she was seen as too radical by the majority of white South African liberals, who contended that the solution to South Africa's racial problems was to be found in non-political, scientific anthropological studies. Her stance isolated her from the South African Institute of Race Relations, the flagship of South African liberalism. The abrasiveness of her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76079/', "William George Ballinger (1892&#150;1974)")</script>, a trade unionist, whom she married on 12 September 1934, contributed to her estrangement from her fellow liberals. William, however, became a loyal partner in their efforts to encourage black economic development. One example of this was a project to make black communities less dependent on exploitative white-managed markets by directly linking co-operatives in the townships to agricultural produce in the British protectorates. As part of their research into the socio-economic and administrative conditions of the protectorates they published two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Indirect Rule in Southern Africa: Basutoland</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">Britain in Southern Africa: Bechuanaland Protectorate</span> (1932). Very little, however, came of these plans.<br>
<br>Margaret Ballinger became isolated and marginalized; her married status gave the university, concerned about her political profile, the opportunity to terminate her appointment in 1935. Depressed, she contemplated emigration, but the <span class="roman">Representation of Natives Act</span> of 1936, which placed Cape blacks on a separate voters' roll with the right to elect white representatives to parliament, provided her with an opportunity to propagate her ideals of a just South Africa. Ballinger had vehemently opposed the act, but realized that a segregationist institution could be used to undermine segregation. Her opposition to racism and her efforts at grassroots level to improve the position of blacks earned Ballinger their respect and led to her election as a native representative in 1937. She was subsequently re-elected until the abolition of the system in 1960.<br>
<br>During the twenty-three years she sat in parliament for the Eastern Cape electoral circle Ballinger gained an international reputation as a remarkable and brilliant parliamentarian, a hard-working representative of her constituents, and a firm opponent of all forms of political and racial intolerance. She also attempted to change the racial prejudice of whites. For her, South Africa's salvation was to transform itself through a gradual constitutional process into a just and democratic society. Uncompromising militancy could only lead to violence, with blacks as the victims. She only demanded changes that she believed whites could deliver. Under General J. C. Smuts's United Party government, with its pragmatic attitude towards segregation, Ballinger did much to alleviate the hardships of individual blacks in their daily struggle to survive the injustices of a racist society. She played a leading role in ensuring that more money was budgeted for black education and for wage increases on the state-owned railways, and she secured the rights of blacks to qualify for pensions. These activities, despite the growing suspicion of her moderation by black militants in the 1940s, earned her much respect in the black community and she was given the praise names Nozizwe (&#145;mother of the nation&#146;) and Tembeka (&#145;she who can be trusted&#146;).<br>
<br>The political atmosphere, however, changed radically in 1948 with the advent of the National Party government and the introduction of apartheid. This went hand in hand with draconian security legislation to suppress any opposition. Ballinger was trapped between black African and Afrikaner nationalism, to both of which she was unacceptable. While to black militants she was part of the system of white oppression, to the National Party she was a dangerous leftist, a closet communist, and an agitator encouraging black resistance to apartheid. Young radical whites regarded her stance on a qualified franchise with the focus purely on parliamentary politics as anachronistic and too conservative. Her leadership of the South African Liberal Party, founded in 1953, was an unhappy experience and she resigned in 1956.<br>
<br>In the apartheid years Ballinger distinguished herself as a champion of liberal democratic rights, and served as parliament's conscience on black affairs. From 1948 she was the only member of the house of assembly to oppose all security legislation unambiguously. (She was supported by William Ballinger, who was a native representative in the senate from 1948.) In her the premier, H. F. Verwoerd, found his intellectual equal and she managed to counter his racial theories and dreams with facts and logic. The result was bitter antagonism between them. Her opposition to apartheid was an important factor in the National Party government's decision to abolish the system of native representation in 1959. In 1965 Ballinger returned to active politics when she became chairperson of the Liberal Party in the Cape province, after the party had been crippled by the banning and intimidation of its leadership. She retained this post until the party voluntarily disbanded in 1968, when multiracial political parties were prohibited. In 1969 her history of native representation was published as <span class="italic">From Union to Apartheid: a Trek to Isolation</span>.<br>
<br>Ballinger retired to Cape Town, where she died at 503 Grosvenor Square, Duke Road, Rondebosch, on 7 February 1980. She was cremated at Maitland crematorium, Cape Town, on 12 February. Her marriage was childless. Short and stockily built, she was aloof and assertive, with a tendency to be overbearing, with a superior attitude. She was a formidable personality and her integrity, steadfastness, and tenacity made her an indefatigable defender of individual liberty. In the darkest days of apartheid she kept the ideal of a democratic and just South Africa alive.<br>
