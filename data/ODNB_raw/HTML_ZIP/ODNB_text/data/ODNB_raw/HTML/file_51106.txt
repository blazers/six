<span class="headword">Jacobs,  Joseph</span>  (1854&#150;1916), <span class="occ">historian and folklorist</span>, was born on 29 August 1854 in Sydney, New South Wales, the son of John Jacobs and his wife, Sarah. After attending Sydney grammar school and the University of Sydney, he journeyed to Britain and, in 1873, after a short spell at London University, entered St John's College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, Jacobs stayed with the family of future Anglo-Jewish historian and foreign affairs activist Lucien Wolf. It was an association that was to prove fruitful. In the early 1880s the two joined the group of north-west London Jewish intellectuals known as the Wanderers&#151;which in 1891 became the Maccabeans&#151;and in 1887 collaborated on the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition and its accompanying catalogue; the following year they jointly produced the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica</span>.<br>
<br>After graduating from Cambridge as a senior moralist, Jacobs, &#145;the prince of goodfellows&#146;, as Israel Zangwill later described him  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England</span>, 131), spent a year in Berlin studying under the renowned Jewish scholars Moritz Lazarus and Moritz Steinschneider. On returning to Britain he furthered his interests in human development as a student of the eugenist Sir Francis Galton. Jacobs then proceeded to carry out a phenological and demographic study of English Jews as a means of confirming his theory that environment rather than biology was the determining factor in the development of racial characteristics. During the 1880s Jacobs published his findings in a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> which he later compiled into two volumes: <span class="italic">Studies in Jewish Statistics</span> (1891) and <span class="italic">Statistics of the Jewish Population in London</span> (1894).<br>
<br>Parallel with his scientific studies, the polymath Jacobs was developing his literary talents. He served as secretary of the Society of Hebrew Literature between 1878 and 1884, having in June 1877 published his first literary essay, a study of George Eliot's <span class="italic">Daniel Deronda</span>, in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span>. Subsequently he published in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> several articles and obituaries&#151;on Matthew Arnold, Robert Browning, and John Henry Newman&#151;and &#145;with efficient editorship and masterpieces of introduction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England</span>, 132) edited several classics, including Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Emma</span> and the <span class="italic">Arabian Nights</span>.<br>
<br>However, Jacobs never lost sight of the Jewish past and present. In 1888 he visited Spain&#151;one of the first Jews to do so since the expulsion&#151;and returned with over 1700 documents, which he published as <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Sources of Spanish-Jewish History</span> (1893). That he won the approval of the &eacute;lite in Spain is confirmed by his appointment as a corresponding member of the Royal Spanish Academy. Jacobs was also an ardent student of English Jewish history, and was a founder member and one-time president of the Jewish Historical Society of England. He believed that the Jewish experience, particularly in the historical context, was only one part of a much wider picture and should always be viewed as such. To this end he published a number of articles on the Jews of medieval England in the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, together with a book on <span class="italic">The Jews of Angevin England</span> (1893).<br>
<br>The plight of Jewish people in the modern world was not neglected. In January 1882 Jacobs published articles in <span class="italic">The Times</span> appealing for an end to the persecution of the Jews and the pogroms which had followed the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881; the attention these pieces attracted resulted in the setting up of the Mansion House Committee and Fund to help the Jews of Russia. During the 1880s Jacobs became increasingly aware of the rising tide of &#145;anti-alien&#146; feeling in England, which coincided with the influx of immigrants from eastern Europe. He sought to dispel some of the myths and stereotyping that were part of the diasporic baggage by producing a volume which would demonstrate that once assimilated Jews made a valuable contribution at all levels of society. The first <span class="italic">Jewish Year Book</span> appeared in 1896. It was a celebratory and didactic volume in which successful Jews&#151;by birth and/or association&#151;were listed in a style reminiscent of <span class="italic">Burke's Peerage</span>. Jacobs's apprehensions about antisemitism continued and in 1914 he requested a meeting with G. K. Chesterton to discuss the latter's antisemitic publications and statements.<br>
<br>Joseph Jacobs was a westernized citizen of the Mosaic persuasion who saw no conflict between nationality and religion. Pursuing this belief, and as a way of &#145;ironing out the ghetto bends&#146;, in 1897, together with Leopold Greenberg (editor of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, 1907&#150;31), he launched <span class="italic">Young Israel</span>, a monthly journal for Jewish youth which combined &#145;the ideals of Englishmen with Jewish values&#146;  (Cesarani, 107). Jacobs's separation of the temporal and the spiritual is evident in his attitude to political Zionism and its advocate Theodore Herzl. Jacobs considered that Herzl &#145;was out of touch with the soul and faith of the Jewish people&#146;, and that on a personal level he was &#145;paltry and materialistic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England</span>, 142).<br>
<br>In spite of his prolific output, Jacobs still found time to marry Georgina Horne, and they had three children. Perhaps it was the presence of young children around him that encouraged the scholarly Jacobs to turn his attention to the world of folklore and fairy tales. In 1888 he published <span class="italic">The Earliest English Version of the Fables of Bedpai</span> and one year later an edition of Caxton's <span class="italic">Fables of Aesop</span>. In 1890, with <span class="italic">English Fairy Tales</span>, he began a series which was to include <span class="italic">Celtic Fairy Tales</span> (1892), <span class="italic">Indian Fairy Tales</span> (1892), <span class="italic">More English Fairy Tales</span> (1893), and <span class="italic">More Celtic Fairy Tales</span> (1894). Jacobs was honorary secretary of the International Folklore Council and editor of <span class="italic">Folklore Magazine</span>. His work appealed to all ages; as Zangwill said of this side of his talent, his &#145;books delighted equally the nursery and the drawing room&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England</span>, 138). His final folklore work, <span class="italic">Europa's Fairy Book</span>, appeared in 1916.<br>
<br>In 1896 Jacobs published a collection of his essays on Jewish history and philosophy under the title <span class="italic">Jewish Ideals</span>. In that same year he went on a lecture tour of America, where he visited Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago. Four years later that &#145;laughing joking man always with new projects and theories to pursue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England</span>, 148) emigrated with his family to New York to take up the position of reviewing editor of the <span class="italic">Jewish Encyclopaedia</span>, a post he held until 1905. He contributed 400 articles to the work and, in 1906, published a companion under the title <span class="italic">The Jewish Encyclopaedia: a Guide to its Contents, an Aid to its Use</span>. This was followed by a six-year professorial appointment as English and rhetoric professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York. In 1908 Jacobs became a member of the board of editors of the Jewish Publication Society and, in 1913, took on a full-time appointment as editor of the <span class="italic">American Hebrew</span>, a position he held until his death. In 1915 Jacobs edited the <span class="italic">American Jewish Year Book</span>. His final literary work, <span class="italic">Jewish Contribution to Civilisation</span>, was published posthumously in 1919.<br>
<br>Joseph Jacobs was a man of intellect and humour, of insight and scholarliness. A humanist who was always &#145;bubbling over with fun&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England</span>, 131), he could be scientific &#145;yet as simple and fresh as a child&#146;  (ibid., 140). He had perhaps too many interests; and concentration on one theme, one topic or one discipline, might have produced a weightier, more intellectually reputed and acknowledged scholar and elicited greater respect for his <i>Wissenschaft des Judentums</i>. But it would have denied many the joy of his folklore, the benefit of his historical and scientific research and analysis, the urgency of his concerns, and the enthusiasm which he gave to every project.<br>
<br>On 30 January 1916, following a bout of pneumonia, Joseph Jacobs died of heart failure at his home in New Rochelle, New York. He was buried in Mount Hope cemetery, New York.<br>
