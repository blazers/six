<span class="headword">Lucy,  Godfrey  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1204), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17149/', "Richard de Lucy (the Loyal) (d. 1179)")</script>, chief justiciar of England. Attached to the court from youth, he became a favoured member of the royal household, and between the early 1170s and Henry II's death in 1189 witnessed thirty royal charters, nine of them in France. He attended schools in London, studying under Master Henry of Northampton; and he also studied abroad, earning the title <i>magister</i>. Then, having taken holy orders, he became a royal clerk, and received a long series of ecclesiastical preferments, being appointed dean of St Martin's-le-Grand in 1171, canon of Lincoln, St Paul's, London, and Exeter, and of the collegiate church of Bampton, Oxfordshire; he was archdeacon of Derby <i>c</i>.1174, and he was also archdeacon of Richmond (1181&#150;4) and parson of the church of Wye. While his elder brother, Geoffrey de Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1170&times;73), was heir to their father's holdings, Godfrey inherited a portion of them; and he was custodian of his two nephews' honour of Ongar, Essex, from <i>c</i>.1181 until their deaths some time before 1194, when they left two sisters as their heirs. This set off a series of lawsuits over the Lucy inheritance lasting into Henry III's reign.<br>
<br>On the resignation of the justiciarship by his father and the subsequent division of England into four circuits at the Council of Windsor in 1179, Godfrey de Lucy was appointed leader of the itinerant justices for the northern eyre. He participated in the remaining judicial eyres of Henry II's reign, also serving as a justice at Westminster, where he continued to sit throughout Richard I's reign as well as acting as a justice on eyre. In 1184 he was dispatched by Henry II to Normandy, together with the bishops of Lincoln (Walter de Coutances) and Norwich (John of Oxford), to arrange terms between Philip Augustus and the count of Flanders. In 1186 he was elected by the chapter of Lincoln to fill the vacant see, but was rejected by Henry, who was resolved on the appointment of Hugh of Avalon (<i>d</i>. 1200). From 1184 to 1186 he was royal custodian of the abbey of St Mary's, York.<br>
<br>Godfrey de Lucy was in 1186 elected to the see of Exeter, which he declined on the ground of the insufficiency of the income to meet the expenses of the office. On the accession of Richard I in 1189 he took a prominent part in the coronation ceremony, and bore the king's linen cap. When Geoffrey Plantagenet (<i>d</i>. 1212) was elected to the archbishopric of York in August 1189, Lucy was absent, but as canon and archdeacon he signified his consent by letter. That same year he reached the episcopate, being one of the five bishops&#151;&#145;all, with one exception, faithful servants of his father, as lawyers or ministers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 1.458)&#151;nominated by Richard I at the great Council of Pipewell on 15 September. His see was Winchester, to which he was consecrated by Archbishop Baldwin in St Katherine's Chapel, Westminster Abbey on 22 October 1189. One of the earliest acts of his episcopate was to reclaim the manors of Meon and Wargrave, of which the see had been deprived. He proceeded <i>ordine judiciario</i>, but according to the chronicler Richard of Devizes took care to secure a favourable verdict by a secret gift to Richard of &pound;3000 in silver, obtaining at the same time the post of sheriff of Hampshire, the confirmation of his own paternal inheritance, together with indemnity for the treasure of his church, and the constableship of the castles of Portchester and Winchester, for which he had to pay another 1000 marks. Not having the means to pay so large a sum, he was unwillingly compelled to borrow it from the treasury of his cathedral, binding himself and his successors to its repayment; the larger part was restored by himself on 28 January 1192.<br>
<br>In November 1189 Lucy was one of the arbitrators appointed by the king to compromise the long-standing dispute between Archbishop Baldwin and the monks of Canterbury over the proposed collegiate church of Hackington. When Richard left early in 1190 for the crusade, Lucy accompanied him as far as Tours (25 June). But he opposed the domination of the government in 1190&#150;91 by William de Longchamp (<i>d</i>. 1197), chancellor and bishop of Ely, as chief justiciar, for he had close ties to the co-justiciar in the north, Hugh du Puiset (<i>d</i>. 1195), bishop of Durham. One of the earliest of Longchamp's high-handed acts was to deprive Lucy, who was detained by sickness in Normandy, of his post as sheriff of Hampshire, custody of his castles, and his paternal inheritance. On his return to England, Lucy lost no time in confronting Longchamp, whom he found at Gloucester besieging the castle. Longchamp received him warmly, followed his advice in giving up the siege, and restored his patrimony, retaining, however, the shrievalty and the castles. At the council held by Longchamp as papal legate at Westminster in October 1190 Lucy sat at his left hand, the bishop of London to his right. The management of the arbitration between Longchamp and Count John, the king's brother, at Winchester on 25 April 1191 was entrusted to him, in conjunction with the bishops of London and Bath.<br>
<br>Further trouble arose in the following September, when Geoffrey Plantagenet, the new archbishop of York, on his landing at Dover was dragged from the church in which he had taken refuge and thrown into prison by the orders of Longchamp. The chancellor's attempt to explain and justify his conduct called forth from Lucy a letter addressed to the prior and convent of Canterbury expressing his grief and indignation, but declining to give them any advice until he had taken counsel with his brother prelates. In the struggle that then ensued between Longchamp and Count John, Lucy took a leading part against the justiciar, attending the meetings of the barons and ecclesiastics summoned at Marlborough, Loddon Bridge, and finally on 8 October 1191, at St Paul's. He was one of the four bishops deputed by the assembly to communicate to Longchamp, who had taken refuge in the Tower of London, their resolution that he must resign; and on Longchamp's deposition, Lucy was reinstated in the custody of the castles of which Longchamp had deprived him. In the crossfire of anathemas that followed he was excommunicated by the pope, in company with John and the chief enemies of Longchamp. One of those commissioned by Richard I on 8 June 1193 to assist the queen mother in securing Hubert Walter's election as archbishop of Canterbury, Lucy joined with the new primate, Hugh of Lincoln, and other prelates in February 1194 in pronouncing excommunication on Count John.<br>
<br>Immediately after Richard's arrival at Winchester on his return from captivity on 15 April 1194, Lucy was once more deprived of the custody of the castles, the shrievalty, and the manors that he had bought of the king five years before, although the bishop repurchased them in 1199, offering a fine of &pound;1000. When Richard I solemnly wore his crown in Winchester Cathedral, Lucy's name is absent from the long list of prelates who took part in the ceremony. But the bishop was in Normandy for several months in 1198, probably summoned by the king in the vain hope that his mediation could effect a reconciliation between Archbishop Geoffrey and the York chapter.<br>
<br>Lucy took part in John's coronation on 27 May 1199, and witnessed a number of royal charters in 1200. Sickness prevented his presence at the great council held by Archbishop Hubert Walter at Westminster on 19 September 1200, but he took part in the obsequies of Bishop Hugh in Lincoln Cathedral on 23 November. The close of Lucy's episcopate was signalled by large additions to the fabric of his cathedral. In 1199 a tower, not now identifiable, had been begun and finished. In 1202 he instituted a confraternity for the repair of the church, to last for five years, by which a spacious retrochoir was created for St Swithun's shrine and a lady chapel was erected with two flanking chapels. The lady chapel is among the earliest examples of the Gothic style in England.<br>
<br>Lucy died at Winchester on 11 or 12 September 1204, and was buried outside the lady chapel he had caused to be built. He had apparently had a long-lasting relationship, possibly a clandestine marriage, with Agatha, a wet-nurse employed by Eleanor of Aquitaine who later married William of Gaddesden, a royal falconer. Evidence exists for three illegitimate sons of Godfrey de Lucy: Geoffrey (<i>d</i>. 1241), archdeacon of London, dean of St Paul's, and chancellor of Oxford University; John, to whom his father gave houses in the Strand, London; and Philip, a clerk of the chamber until 1207.<br>
<br>That Lucy's character for practical wisdom stood high with his sovereigns is shown by the various delicate missions with which he was entrusted. Henry II, a good judge of character, formed a high opinion of him. Lucy was the first English bishop systematically to date his letters, inspired by his experience in royal government. The editor of <span class="italic">Glanvill</span> suggests his authorship of the pioneer law book as &#145;an intriguing possibility&#146;. Lucy was described by Bishop William Stubbs, the great nineteenth-century scholar, as &#145;a good average bishop&#146;  (Stubbs, xxxi). The claim that he had a canal dug connecting Alresford to Winchester is now discredited, but in 1199 he established a market at Alresford and in 1202 a three-day fair; he also reconstructed the town centre to create a large market square. He augmented the revenues of Lessness Abbey (or Westwood), founded by his father the justiciar on his retirement from public life, and where he had died a canon in 1179. Apparently the bishop planned that Lessness should be the Lucy family mausoleum.<br>
