<span class="headword">Kilburne,  Richard</span>  (1605&#150;1678), <span class="occ">lawyer and topographer</span>, was baptized at St Mary Woolchurch, London, on 6 October 1605, the fifth and youngest son of Isaac Kilburne and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Clarke of Saffron Walden, Essex. His father's family originated from Kilburne, Yorkshire, later moving to Cambridgeshire and to Essex. Kilburne entered Staple's Inn, became an eminent chancery lawyer, and on five occasions was chosen to be principal of his inn. Writing in 1798 Edward Hasted described Kilburne as &#145;a man of some eminence &hellip; as a lawyer, being as worthy a character, both as a magistrate and an historian&#146;  (Hasted, 7.148).<br>
<br>Success in his legal career brought Kilburne into contact with Kent and Sussex. During the later 1620s he inherited Fowlers, an estate in the parish of Hawkhurst, Kent. Along with his neighbour William Boys he served as a Kentish magistrate and both men were asked during the Commonwealth to marry couples without sacred rites; but whereas Boys married sixty couples, Kilburne married only two. In his legal work he became a steward of two Sussex manors, Brede and Bodiam, from 1639 onwards. During the 1660s he was writing from Fowlers about land in Peasmarsh and 26 acres overlooking Rye, the latter owned by John Halsey of Lincoln's Inn. In one letter, dated 27 December 1669, he asks &#145;his much respected Freind, Mr Samuell Jeake, at Rye&#146;  (Smart, 303), to investigate that these acres were being well used, before replying to their owner. Kilburne's first marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of William Davy of Beckley, Sussex, produced a family of six sons and three daughters. After Elizabeth's death he married on 24 January 1653 a widow, Sarah Burchet, formerly Short, who brought several children of her previous marriage.<br>
<br>Kilburne's career was similar to that of William Lambarde (1536&#150;1601), whom he much admired; both men were authors of topographical and legal works. Kilburne's first, <span class="italic">A brief survey of the county of Kent, viz. the names of the parishes in the same, in what bailiwick &hellip; and division &hellip; every of the said parishes is; &hellip; the day on which any market or faire is kept therein; the ancient names of the parish churches, etc</span> (1657), was followed by <span class="italic">A topographie, or survey of the county of Kent, with some chronological, historicall, and other matters touching the same</span> (1659), that presented, as his &#145;Epistle Dedicatory&#146; outlined, &#145;the Kent of his own day&#146;, and depicted &#145;the county as it was before the Civil War&#146;. Hasted, in 1797, was rather dismissive of this work as being &#145;little more than a Directory&#146;  (Hasted, 1.iii). Kent was not well served by early topographers, and Kilburne's small survey was extensively quoted on sixteen occasions by Robert Furley and, over the years in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cantiana</span>, as a first source of reference, and not without some praise. The <span class="italic">Topographie</span> devoted disproportionate attention to Hawkhurst: 10 pages out of 422, or, in the words of one writer, &#145;as much space to it as to twenty other average parishes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Cantiana</span>, 5, 1863, 59). Kilburne justified this, however:<blockquote>In respect I finde not any description of this Parish &hellip; it having been the place of my habitation for above twenty eight years last past (God's Providence having also there lent me an inheritance), I thought fit to enlarge my selfe upon this place. (Kilburne, 126)</blockquote>Kilburne's legal notes were published only after his death, as <span class="italic">Choice presidents upon all acts of parliament, relating to the office and duty of a justice of the peace</span> (1680). It ran through a series of expanded editions, the eighth and last appearing in 1715.<br>
<br>Kilburne died on 15 November 1678 and was buried in the north chancel of Hawkhurst church. He was generous to his sons, William, Isaac, and Thomas, and to his stepchildren, but Fowlers passed to Anne (Mrs Brewer) his only surviving daughter. Regarding his association with Kent, his <span class="italic">Topographie</span> records &#145;my Obligation of Gratitude to that County (wherein I have had a comfortable subsistence for above Thirty five years &hellip; and for some of them had the Honour to serve the same)&#146;  (Kilburne, &#145;Epistle Dedicatory&#146;).<br>
