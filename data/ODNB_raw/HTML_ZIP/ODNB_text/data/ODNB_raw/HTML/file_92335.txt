<span class="headword">Maguire,  Samuel <span class="st"> [Sam]</span></span>  (1877&#150;1927), <span class="occ">Irish republican and promoter of Gaelic sports</span>, was born on 11 March 1877 at Malabracca, Dunmanway, co. Cork, the third son and fourth of the eight children of John Maguire (1840&#150;1908), farmer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kingston (1851&#150;1917). His parents were both from the Dunmanway area of west Cork and members of the Church of Ireland. Maguire was educated at the model school in Dunmanway and attended Church of Ireland services in the town every Sunday. After his senior year at the model school he was sent to the school of Michael Madden, Ollscoil an tSleibhte, in Ardfield, near Clonakilty, which was renowned for preparing boys for the civil service entrance examinations. Maguire was successful, and moved from Cork to London in 1897 to take up a position as a sorter with the Post Office in Mount Pleasant. He was subsequently joined in London by his two younger brothers, Jack and Dick, who had undergone the same education with Madden. As well as preparing boys for the civil service, Madden was a nationalist with extensive links throughout the republican movement. Madden's influence was critical in the creation of Maguire's nationalist awareness; Madden also introduced him to a series of men who would, like Maguire himself, rise to prominence in the secret nationalist organization the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and the sporting movement the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).<br>
<br>Once in London, Maguire threw himself into the life of the GAA. Founded in 1884, the GAA was concerned with the promotion of traditional Irish sports, such as Gaelic football and hurling, as a way of arresting the Anglicization of Irish life. Although having never played the games of the GAA in Ireland, and despite being a protestant, Maguire became a cornerstone of the association in London. He began playing for the Hibernian football club in 1898, and between 1901 and 1904 captained them to four consecutive London championships. In an attempt to bolster the appeal of the GAA in London, the annual end of season championship match, the All-Ireland, was reconfigured so that London automatically qualified and played the winning team that emerged from the Irish-based competition. In 1900, 1901, and 1903 Maguire was able to lead the senior London county panel to the All-Ireland finals in the Dublin sportsground later named Croke Park, though his team was defeated on each occasion. As a result of his strenuous efforts to promote the GAA in London, Maguire was elected chairman of the London county board in 1907, and remained actively engaged in GAA affairs until leaving London in 1923.<br>
<br>As a supporter of the nationalist revival Maguire became a member of the Gaelic League in London. He came to the attention of the IRB who recruited him to the movement in 1902. Maguire quickly rose to be head of the IRB in the London district and began recruiting new members himself. In a secret ceremony at Islington in November 1909, he swore into the IRB another young Post Office worker from Clonakilty, who was also an ex-pupil of Madden's school, Michael Collins.<br>
<br>Maguire rose to become the IRB's chief intelligence officer in London. Unlike Collins and many other London IRB activists, he did not return to Dublin to take part in the 1916 rising, believing that remaining in his civil service post was the best way of promoting the struggle against Britain. His main function, through to the period of the Anglo-Irish War (1919&#150;21), was to intercept official state documents relevant to British military and political intentions in Ireland. During the war he also used his position in the Post Office to smuggle arms from London to Ireland.<br>
<br>Maguire continued to work for Collins and the pro-treaty side in the Irish civil war (1922&#150;3), but it appears that British intelligence became increasingly suspicious of him in the period after the assassination of Sir Henry Wilson in 1922. Maguire was tipped off that Scotland Yard was about to close in on him so he left England for Dublin in 1923. He was rewarded with a job in the newly established Irish Free State civil service, once more working in the Post Office, but fell foul of a government cleansing of the IRB from the civic administration. On 29 December 1924 he was dismissed from the Post Office because of his membership of the IRB and the belief that he was working against the government. The charges against Maguire were never formally proved, and despite an appeal and discussion of his dismissal in the D&aacute;il, the government held firm and ensured that he never worked for government again. Without an income Maguire, who was unmarried, returned home to Dunmanway in May 1926, dying there from tuberculosis on 6 February 1927. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Dunmanway, three days later.<br>
<br>Maguire was remembered by the GAA for his role in their organization. In 1928 a group of his friends formed a committee in Dublin to raise funds for a permanent commemoration of his name. They decided on a cup to be presented to the GAA. The cup cost &pound;300, was modelled on the Ardagh chalice, and was made by Hopkins and Hopkins of Dublin. First presented in 1928 to All-Ireland final winners Kildare, the Sam Maguire cup is still the premier annual prize in Gaelic football. A statue of him was unveiled in Dunmanway in 2002.<br>
