<span class="headword">Chilton,  William</span>  (1815&#150;1855), <span class="occ">printer and freethinker</span>, was baptized in the parish of St Philip and St Jacob, Bristol, on 2 July 1815, the son of William Chilton, a tin-plate worker, and Mary Ann Chilton, a dressmaker. From 1829 to 1836 he was apprenticed to a printer, William Henry Somerton; in 1841 he returned to live with his sixty-year-old widowed mother (his father having died some time before 1829). Chilton worked on the reformist <span class="italic">Bristol Mercury</span> all his life, first as a compositor and eventually as a reader.<br>
<br>Chilton was a doctrinaire atheist; indeed G. J. Holyoake considered him &#145;the only absolute atheist I have known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sixty Years</span>, 1.142). A member of the Bristol branch of the Owenite movement, Chilton abhorred the attempt of the Central Board of the Association of All Classes of All Nations to register the Owenites as &#145;Rational Religionists&#146; and play &#145;the <i>whore</i> with the priests&#146;  (Chilton to G. J. Holyoake, 26 Dec 1841, Holyoake Collection no. 22, Co-operative Union, Manchester). Accordingly he resigned from the movement and stopped lecturing in the Hall of Science in Bristol. In 1841 he and Charles Southwell founded the inflammatory penny weekly <span class="italic">Oracle of Reason</span> (1841&#150;3), which refuted God's existence and undermined the spiritual props of the undemocratic state. As libelling the scriptures was tantamount to sedition, Southwell was gaoled for blasphemy. Chilton, remaining as sub-editor, invited Holyoake to become the figurehead editor, and became editor himself only in June 1843 after Holyoake and his successor Thomas Paterson had been imprisoned. The <span class="italic">Oracle</span>'s scurrilous tone had even the veteran agitator Richard Carlile denouncing the &#145;blackguard&#146; Southwell and pronouncing Chilton &#145;no better&#146;  (Carlile to Paterson, 11 Dec 1842, Holyoake Collection no. 88, Co-operative Union, Manchester).<br>
<br>Chilton accused the clergy and gentry of perverting science to support the <i>status quo</i>, and in the <span class="italic">Oracle</span> he turned zoology and geology into street weaponry. Attacking the <span class="roman">Genesis</span> myth of creation was <i>de rigueur</i> in ultra-radical prints, but Chilton's series entitled &#145;Theory of regular gradation&#146; (meaning the progressive &#145;evolution&#146; of life) took this to extremes. The 48-part series (begun by Southwell, but principally by Chilton) moved in a ramshackle way from planetary formation and the chemical origin of life to a monkey ancestry for mankind. Chilton saw life's development as a &#145;modification through circumstance&#146; in line with the Owenites' environmental determinism. His materials were necessarily cannibalized, partly from Robert Chambers's miscellanies and Charles Lyell's refutation of Lamarckism in <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span>.<br>
<br>Chilton's campaigns for gaoled atheist and Chartist friends, and his publication of Strauss's <span class="italic">Life of Jesus</span> and other subversive literature, had equally to be squeezed around his ten-hour working day as a compositor. He would camp in his works for weeks on end, with no &#145;time to eat, to sleep, and certainly not to think&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>, 3, 1847, 608). <span class="italic">Oracle</span> articles were set up in type without copy, and their scorching tone told of an activist who thought on his feet. His reductionist biology was laced with cynicism, but his propagandist use of transmutation set the trend for militant atheists from Emma Martin to John Watts.<br>
<br>Part of Chilton's meagre earnings went to support his mother. During Holyoake's trial Chilton met a cooper's daughter, Mary Ann Morris (<i>b</i>. 1819/20); they married on 26 September 1843 and had two children, Kate (<i>b</i>. 1846) and Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1848).<br>
<br>Chilton muted his approach on switching to Holyoake's less blustery <span class="italic">Movement</span> in 1844. Becoming more familiar with middle-class literature, he turned Lyell's geochronology to anti-scriptural ends and dissected the biblical glossing of geology attempted by Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland. In <span class="italic">The Movement</span> and <span class="italic">The Reasoner</span> (a paper he part managed) Chilton noted that the anonymous <span class="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</span> (1844) reworked similar evolutionary ground, although its higher design was far removed from his necessitarian materialism. About this time he began republishing rationalist books in penny numbers in his <span class="roman">Library of Reason</span>; twenty-three volumes appeared in all, the costs being defrayed by J. W. Birch and the publisher Henry Hetherington.<br>
<br>Such activism did not preclude Chilton's being made a freeman of the city of Bristol in 1848, for which he was eligible as a former apprentice serving a trade. He co-ordinated Holyoake's free-thought lecture tour in 1847&#150;8 and in 1852 sat on the central council at the conference of secularists at Manchester. However, his health had deteriorated, and he died, probably of an arterial aneurysm, at Bristol on 28 May 1855, aged only forty; he was buried there on 2 June.<br>
