<span class="headword">Lumsden, Sir  Henry Burnett <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1821&#150;1896), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 12 November 1821 on the East India Company's ship <i>Rose</i>, in the Bay of Bengal, was the eldest son of Colonel Thomas Lumsden (1789&#150;1874), Bengal artillery, of Belhelvie Lodge, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Hay (<i>d</i>. 11 Oct 1873), youngest daughter of John Burnett of Elrick, Aberdeenshire. Lumsden was sent home from India in 1827 and educated at Bellevue Academy, Aberdeen, and at Mr Dawes's school, Bromley, Kent. He returned to India as a cadet at the age of sixteen, and on 1 March 1838 was commissioned ensign in the 59th Bengal native infantry.<br>
<br>Lumsden displayed a marked aptitude for languages and in the spring of 1843 was attached as interpreter and quartermaster to the 33rd Bengal infantry, which formed part of the army, under the command of Sir George Pollock, that during the First Anglo-Afghan War forced the Khyber Pass. He first saw action on 5 April 1842. While at Kabul, Lumsden struck up a close friendship with John Nicholson. On 16 July 1842 he was promoted lieutenant, and early in 1843 returned to join the 59th native infantry at Ludhiana. Lumsden fought with his regiment during the Sutlej campaign and in February 1846 was severely wounded at the battle of Sobraon.<br>
<br>When Sir Henry Lawrence was made resident at Lahore, he appointed Lumsden on 15 April 1846 as one of his assistants. Lumsden accompanied Lawrence to Kashmir in October, and in December was sent with 3000 Sikh troops and six guns through Hazara. Lumsden's force encountered resistance from 7000 hostile tribesmen, but he successfully forced the passage of the two tributaries of the Jhelum, near Muzaffarabad, and following two sharp engagements eventually forced them to submit. He received the thanks of government and was given responsibility by Lawrence for raising the corps of guides for frontier service. Lumsden enjoyed complete freedom regarding the recruitment, training, and equipment of this force, which initially consisted of 100 horsemen and 200 infantrymen. Its recruits were chosen from the warlike frontier tribes who knew the terrain of the border hills&#151;in his own words, men &#145;accustomed to look after themselves, and not easily taken aback by any sudden emergency&#146;. Lumsden directed that the new unit wear a serviceable khaki uniform, later adopted by the rest of the Indian army, ideally suited to military operations on the north-west frontier. The guide cavalry distinguished itself under Lumsden's command during the siege of Multan in 1848, and again on 3 January 1849, when it surprised and destroyed a Sikh raiding force near the border with Kashmir. For these actions Lumsden again received the thanks of government.<br>
<br>On 21 February 1849 Lumsden fought at the battle of Gujrat, for which he was mentioned in dispatches and received the Punjab medal with two clasps. On 19 June the strength of the corps of guides was increased to 400 horsemen and 600 infantrymen, in recognition of its success. Following the occupation of the Punjab, Lumsden was appointed assistant commissioner in Yusufzai, in addition to his military duties, and for a short time was placed in charge of Peshawar district, where he had to deal closely with the frequently hostile border tribes over whom he exercised considerable personal influence. He developed an intimate knowledge of the language and of the inhabitants of the tribal territory, demonstrating his ability both as an administrator and as a skilled frontier soldier during repeated skirmishes and punitive campaigns. As Lord Dalhousie wrote: &#145;A braver or better soldier never drew a sword. The governor-general places unbounded confidence in him and in the gallant body of men he commands.&#146;<br>
<br>Lumsden went home on leave in November 1852 after fifteen years of continuous service in India. He was promoted captain on 1 March 1853, and on 6 February 1854 he was given a brevet majority for his services during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He returned to India at the end of 1855 and assumed command of the guides, now permanently deployed in the trans-Indus areas of the Punjab. In 1857 he was sent on a mission to Kandahar, accompanied by his brother Lieutenant Peter Lumsden and by Dr Henry Walter Bellew, to ensure that subsidies paid by the government of India to the amir were used for the payment of troops employed to defend Afghanistan against Persia following the recent capture of Herat. The mission was also responsible for advising and assisting the amir as far as possible without arousing the hostility of the Afghan population. On 25 April they reached Kandahar, but news of the outbreak of the Indian mutiny made their position extremely hazardous. Despite a constant fear of attack by the local population Lumsden remained at Kabul throughout the uprising, in order to maintain British prestige and influence over the amir. He finally returned to India on 15 May 1858 when he was promoted lieutenant-colonel. For his services, and for the sound judgement he displayed at Kabul, Lumsden was made a civil CB on 5 December 1859. However, this proved little reward for the opportunities he had missed for command on active service during the Indian mutiny. On 5 September 1866 he married Fanny, daughter of Charles Myers of Dunningwell, Cumberland, vicar of Flintham, Nottinghamshire; she survived her husband.<br>
<br>Lumsden was promoted major-general on 6 March 1868, and was made a KCSI on 24 May 1873. He became lieutenant-general on 1 December 1873, and general on 1 January 1880. His later career suffered, however, from his absence from India during the mutiny, when many other senior officers came to prominence. Lumsden was not offered further employment in the army, and he refused civil posts, for which he was qualified, as he intensely disliked official routine. He retired from the army on 15 September 1875, and spent the remainder of his life at Belhelvie Lodge, Aberdeenshire, which he had inherited on his father's death in 1874. He occupied his time with sport, photography, and wood-carving. Lumsden died at Belhelvie Lodge on 12 August 1896.<br>
