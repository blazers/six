<span class="headword">Hippisley,  John</span>  (1696&#150;1748), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born on 14 January 1696 near Wookey Hole in Somerset. He made his theatrical d&eacute;but as Fondlewife in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Bachelor</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 7 November 1722. Although he was then billed as having appeared on the stage previously, there is no account of his having done so elsewhere. Later in the same season he played Scrub in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span>, Sir Hugh Evans in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Gomez in John Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>, and various other comic parts, including Polonius and Pandarus, and these certainly indicate that he may have had some experience in such roles. He remained with John Rich at Lincoln's Inn Fields until the 1732&#150;3 season, when he began working at Covent Garden, first appearing there on the theatre's opening night, 6 December 1732, as Sir Wilful Witwould in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span>. Over the previous decade his repertory of characters had grown impressively and now included Scapin in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Cheats of Scapin</span>, Sir Francis Gripe in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span>, Barnaby Brittle in Thomas Betterton's <span class="italic">The Amorous Widow</span>, Sir William Wisewood in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span>, Scruple in Charles Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Fair Quaker</span>, and Sancho in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Rover</span>.<br>
<br>Hippisley was popular for his portrayal of fools and scoundrels, for his provincial accents, and for his portrayal of female roles. He was equally renowned for his comic presentation of the aged&#151;Corbaccio in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span> being a notable success. For his benefit on 3 May 1723 he played Pandarus in <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> and for that of 23 April 1731 he took the part of the Welshman David Shenkin in his own farce <span class="italic">The Journey to Bristol, or, The Honest Welshman</span>. This production may well have first been presented the previous year at Bristol, where Hippisley had built a playhouse.<br>
<br>Hippisley's connection with Bristol had begun in 1728, when he travelled there to perform his play <span class="italic">The English Thief, or, The Welsh Lawyer</span> on 14 August. Towards the end of that year he leased land adjacent to the Horse and Groom in Jacob's Wells, where the city's first permanent theatre was later erected; it opened on 23 June 1729 with Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>. The building was only modest in size and required actors exiting on one side of the stage to walk round the exterior of the building if they had then to enter from the other wing. The first decade of his management incurred great debts, however, and by 1736 Hippisley had to mortgage his Covent Garden salary in order to sustain the venture. Between 1741 and 1747 he regularly occupied the theatre over the summer seasons, and he performed a series of roles there, including Scapin, Permain, Day in Sir Robert Howard's <span class="italic">The Committee</span>, and Dogberry in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>. In November 1747 he proposed to build a larger playhouse in Bath, though he did not live to see the project completed. Despite commitments in the west country, Hippisley also managed to participate in the summer fairs, and appeared on 22 August 1730 at Bartholomew fair. In July 1731 he played with the Richmond troupe to offer a collection of performances and in August he joined in the co-management of a booth at Bartholomew fair, where he performed Shallow in <span class="italic">The Emperor of China</span>; the production transferred to Southwark fair that September.<br>
<br>From 1732 until his death Hippisley remained at Covent Garden. New parts performed over the years included Shallow in <span class="italic">2 Henry IV</span>, Scaramouch in Behn's <span class="italic">The Emperor of the Moon</span>, Phaeax in Dryden's version of <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, Muckworm in Henry Carey's <span class="italic">The Honest Yorkshireman</span>, Ananias in Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>, Clown in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, Drudge in the pantomime <span class="italic">Orpheus and Eurydice</span>, and Gardiner in <span class="italic">King Henry VIII</span>. On 17 January 1747 he was also the original Sir Simon Loveit in Garrick's <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span>.<br>
<br>In the epilogue to his own work <span class="italic">Journey to Bristol</span>, Hippisley declared that &#145;his ugly face is farce&#146;, and according to Samuel Foote in <span class="italic">Roman and English Comedy</span> &#145;the left corner of his Mouth, and the Extremity of his Chin, became very near Neighbours&#146;  (Foote, 33). This was the result of a burn sustained as a youth, and Hippisley fully exploited his unconventional appearance for its on-stage comic potential. Davies refers to him as a &#145;comedian of lively humour and droll pleasantry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Garrick</span>, 1.356), and informs us that, although it was customary to compare his performances negatively with those of Benjamin Johnson, Hippisley's Corbaccio was considered the superior of the two. His Fondlewife matched Cibber's own portrayal of the character and his performance of Fumble in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Plotting Sisters</span> was considered to have saved the play.<br>
<br>Hippisley was not a prolific dramatist. After the apparently unpublished <span class="italic">The English Thief</span> (1728) he adapted Thomas Doggett's <span class="italic">Hob, or, The Country Wake</span> as the ballad opera <span class="italic">Flora</span>, performed and published in 1729. His other two ballad operas, <span class="italic">Journey to Bristol</span> and <span class="italic">A Sequel to the Opera of Flora</span>, were published in 1731 and 1732 respectively. His monologue <span class="italic">The Drunken Man</span>, published posthumously in 1776, remained popular with public and performers for the remainder of the century.<br>
<br>Hippisley died in Bristol on 12 February 1748, having been ill for several months, and was even reported as dead in October 1747 (provoking a witty denial in response from the actor). He had drawn up a will on 1 February in which he had properly provided for his partner, Mary Charley, and two of his children (<a href="#cosubject_13357">Elizabeth Hippisley [<i>see below</i>]</a> was left out of the testament) as well as for his legal wife, Elizabeth. It is not known when he married and separated from his wife, nor whether he had more than three children. The Hippisley family's association with the theatre and circus continued into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>The three of Hippisley's children of whom something is known all appeared on the stage. <a name="cosubject_13357"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Hippisley</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1742&#150;1769)<span class="occ"></span> first took to the stage as Angelina in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">Love Makes a Man</span> on 25 January 1742 at Giffard's playhouse in Goodman's Fields. In her first season she adopted the role of Rose in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, which she was to play numerous times in her career. She established herself at Lincoln's Inn Fields and Covent Garden and spent summer seasons performing at her father's theatre in Bristol. In the 1750s and 1760s she played numerous secondary roles at Drury Lane, her last recorded appearance being on 8 April 1769 as Myrtilla in Cibber's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>. As Mrs Fitzmaurice, she apparently played in York and Bath, though she ended her career as a dresser in Bath.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13358"></a><span class="headword">Jane Hippisley</span>  (1719&#150;1791)<span class="occ"></span> made her first appearance at her father's benefit at Covent Garden on 18 March 1735 as Cherry in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span>. She had considerable success in her stage career, and played Ophelia to Garrick's Hamlet in his first season at Goodman's Fields, Kitty Pry in Garrick's <span class="italic">The Lying Valet</span>, and Biddy in his <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span>. She was said to have had a liaison with Garrick in 1746&#150;7, and it is possible that she called herself Mrs Green after 1747 to cover the birth of a child: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64326/', "Samuel Cautherley")</script> was rumoured to be the product of her relationship with Garrick, but neither parent can be confirmed. Mrs Green performed in Dublin in 1751&#150;2, was the first Mrs Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (1773), and was the first Mrs Malaprop in 1775. She acted in Garrick's <span class="italic">The Irish Widow</span> in Bristol as late as 4 July 1781. She made her last appearance on the London stage, as Mrs Hardcastle, on 26 May 1780 and died in her house at Jacob's Wells, Bristol, in the winter of 1791. Hippisley's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13360/', "John Hippisley")</script>, began his career as a child actor, but is better remembered as a writer on African economics.<br>
