<span class="headword">Wise,  Thomas James</span>  (1859&#150;1937), <span class="occ">book collector and forger</span>, was born on 7 October 1859 at 52 Wrotham Road, Gravesend, Kent, the eldest of four children, all sons, of Thomas Wise (1828&#150;1902) and Julia Victoria Dauncy (1838&#150;1881). The father, described by his son as &#145;manufacturing traveller&#146;, gave his occupation on the birth certificate of his youngest son as &#145;tobacconist&#146;. After Thomas's birth the family returned to live in a drab part of Holloway, first at 37 and later at 127 Devonshire Road, an address at which Wise lived until the age of thirty. He claimed variously to have been educated privately and at the City of London School. There is no corroborative evidence in either case, and the origin of his interest in English literature is not known. Wise himself ascribed it to reading poetry, especially that of Shelley, to his invalid mother. His own first writings were published in &#145;Pen and Pencil&#146;, the manuscript magazine of his immediate social circle. This included Walter Brindley Slater, a book collector, and he it may have been who pointed Wise in a similar direction; Slater outlived Wise and became his executor. By his own account (of which one must be wary), Wise began collecting books seriously in 1877 at the age of eighteen, buying uncut copies of Shelley's <span class="italic">The Cenci</span> (1819) and Moore's <span class="italic">The Epicurean</span> (1827) for 20<i>s</i>. the pair.<br>
<br>In 1875 Wise, then aged sixteen, joined Herman Rubeck &amp; Co. as office boy. The firm was a dealer in essential oils, as used in perfumes and food flavourings. Wise evidently showed a head for business: he became chief clerk and cashier before he was thirty. He also became friendly with his employer's son Otto Rubeck, who was later involved with Wise in other business enterprises. Wise seems to have had a part in expanding Rubecks from being mainly a mercantile concern into manufacturing. During the First World War the firm did particularly well, virtually cornering the market in vanillin, a flavouring with many applications. By this time Wise had become a partner, and he retired from business about 1920&#151;somewhat later than he occasionally claimed.<br>
<br>Wise began his career as a publisher with his own writings before turning to the works of others. His <span class="italic">Verses</span> (1882&#150;3) is notable mainly for the variety of its issues, being printed on vellum and on five different kinds of paper. Similar multiple formats were used for his next publication, Keats's &#145;Ode to a Nightingale&#146; (1884). He then wrote an introduction to a photolithographic facsimile of Dickens's <span class="italic">Sunday, under Three Heads</span> (also 1884), which may have given him the idea for comparable enterprises; it contained an advertisement for a &#145;complete bibliography&#146; of Keats, which if it had appeared would have been his first attempt at such a publication. He joined the Browning Society at its inception in 1881, and became a member of its committee in 1884 as well as editing a facsimile of <span class="italic">Pauline</span> (1838). This for the first time brought him into contact with Richard Clay &amp; Sons, and accustomed the firm to producing for him works with antedated imprints. Wise joined the Shelley Society when it was founded in 1885, and became its secretary two years later. This enabled him to produce a series of publications, partly in the society's name and partly on his own account (but using the society's funds), which bankrupted it in 1892. He was encouraged in this extravagance by F. J. Furnivall, the mainspring of both societies; they may have lost money by it, but Wise did not.<br>
<br>In January 1886, also at Furnivall's suggestion, Wise met his future accomplice <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33204/', "Henry (known as Harry) Buxton Forman")</script>. The latter had already embarked on the fraudulent misdating of books, apparently not with thoughts of gain, but aiming rather to create what ought to have existed. How soon their plans matured will never be known, but Buxton Forman may have alerted Wise to the possibilities of &#145;facsimile&#146; printing, and Wise made Buxton Forman aware of the potential profits. In 1886 Buxton Forman printed a facsimile, from his own recently acquired copy, of Byron's <span class="italic">Fugitive Pieces</span> (1806), and in 1887 Wise produced Shelley's <span class="italic">Poems and Sonnets</span>, the texts pirated from Edward Dowden's <span class="italic">Life of Shelley</span>, with a false Philadelphia imprint. Undeterred by Dowden's polite but unwavering condemnation of it, the two became bolder. Editions of Swinburne's <span class="italic">Cleopatra</span>, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <span class="italic">The Runaway Slave</span>, and George Eliot's <span class="italic">Brother and Sister</span> were all produced within the year, modelled with various degrees of accuracy on genuine works by the same authors. Their distribution was small outside the market, still limited, for rare works by contemporary authors; and Swinburne and Browning, to whom Wise boldly sent copies, were not suspicious. More Swinburne pamphlets followed, with others by Ruskin and Browning. The Browning pamphlets were listed in the bibliography of William Sharp's <span class="italic">Life of Browning</span> (1890), which was circulated to the Browning Society; thus were sown the seeds of the fictitious &#145;Reading&#146; edition of <span class="italic">Sonnets from the Portuguese</span>, the partnership's best-known and most expensive creation. The forgers' originality lay in progressing from attempts to reproduce genuine first editions, a procedure relatively easy to detect, to producing pamphlets which had no resemblance to the true first edition, but which fraudulently bore an earlier date. This conception, together with establishing and marketing the pamphlets, was a remarkable contribution to the history of forgery.<br>
<br>The freedom of Wise and Buxton Forman from detection was due to a number of factors. The books were small, their alleged genesis obscure; they might well have escaped the notice even of specialist collectors. Forgotten batches of genuine pamphlets did exist (Buxton Forman himself had found a quantity of the Brownings' <span class="italic">Two Poems</span>, 1854). If the forgeries looked new, they could be explained as &#145;remainders&#146;, the forgers' euphemism for them in the handful of references that survive in their correspondence. The market was a relatively small and restricted one: buyers were few, but they were prepared to pay high prices, especially in the nascent trade in modern first editions in America, where the forgeries were first put on public sale. Wise was expert in marketing them, utilizing, for example, J. P. Smart's bibliography of Ruskin (1889&#150;93), and writing sale notes for <span class="italic">The Bookman</span>. He made a new and influential friend in Edmund Gosse, who publicized the legend of the &#145;Reading&#146; <span class="italic">Sonnets</span>. The publication of <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century</span> (1896), nominally &#145;edited&#146; by Wise and Robertson Nicoll but in fact mostly by Buxton Forman, further established the forgeries. The deaths of Tennyson (1892), Robert Louis Stevenson (1894), and William Morris (1896) encouraged the forgers to step up their activities, although the forgeries of Morris alerted his vigilant secretary S. C. Cockerell, and awkward questions were posed in the New York trade press. The forgers prudently ceased their productions after the turn of the century.<br>
<br>Wise now moved into other activities in the book trade. Sales to collectors and selected booksellers brought in substantial sums, but individual forgeries could also be exchanged to improve his collection. Arundell Esdaile's verdict that &#145;in the sixteenth and early seventeenth century writers his library &hellip; was of moderate, in the late seventeenth and the eighteenth of very great, and in the nineteenth of unapproached completeness&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) resulted from Wise's market sense and preference for buying cheap. As the market for Shakespeare and his contemporaries was strong, Wise bought imperfect quarto plays which he &#145;improved&#146; by stealing replacements for the missing or damaged leaves from copies in the British Museum (these thefts were not discovered until the 1950s). He did this not only for his own collection but also for the copies that he sold to his American clients, notably J. H. Wrenn, whose collection is now held by the University of Texas. Wise was initially not interested in the bibliographical or textual importance of original condition, but came to appreciate it more as he published his catalogues and bibliographies, beginning in 1901. If a book was not in pristine condition, or did not possess desirable &#145;points&#146;, he ensured that these features were supplied.<br>
<br>In 1890 Wise had left the family home to marry Selina Fanny Smith (<i>b</i>. 1868), and moved to 52 Ashley Road, Crouch End, where he was first able to fit out a room for his collection, now dignified by the name of the road as &#145;The Ashley Library&#146;. His wife left him in 1895 (they were divorced in 1897), and he moved to Hampstead in 1896. On 27 June 1900 he married his second wife, Frances Louise (1872&#150;1939), daughter of Francis Greenhalgh, of Bolton. She gave him affection and support, but there is no reason to believe that she was involved in his nefarious activities. He had no children by either marriage. They moved to 23 Downside Crescent, Belsize Park, in 1900, and then to 25 Heath Drive, Hampstead, in 1910. Publishing the treasures of the Ashley Library became Wise's principal occupation&#151;and a lucrative one, though by this time he was already well off. He had issued short lists in 1893 and 1895; the first specimen of a catalogue in 1901 was followed by a trial edition in two volumes (1905&#150;8). The full-dress <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Ashley Library</span> ran to eleven volumes (1922&#150;36), each with an introduction by a well-established literary figure. It became, as its compiler intended, a standard reference work for the bibliography of English literature.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> was supported by a series of author bibliographies: Browning (1897), Swinburne (1897, 1919&#150;20), Tennyson (1908), Coleridge (1913, 1919), Borrow (1914), Wordsworth (1916), the Bront&euml;s (1917), Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1918), Landor (1919), Conrad (1920), Keats (1921), and Byron (1932&#150;3). He also published nine separate catalogues of his own collection, each devoted to a single author, beginning with <span class="italic">A Shelley Library</span> (1924). Privately published and expensive, they were seen as essential items by other collectors, libraries, and booksellers. Still more profitable were editions, including many &#145;limited editions&#146;, of minor pieces by major authors. The example of Shelley was applied to the Swinburne material that he obtained, by doubtful means, from Theodore Watts-Dunton after the poet's death in 1909, and invited Gosse to edit. The Borrow and Bront&euml; manuscripts collected by his friend Clement Shorter were similarly issued. In all, Wise published over 400 items.<br>
<br>By the 1920s Wise had become respectable as well as rich. He was president of the Bibliographical Society (1922&#150;4), honorary fellow (owing to the friendship of the collector C. H. Wilkinson) of Worcester College, Oxford, honorary MA of Oxford University (1926), and a member of the Roxburghe Club. The Oxford honorifics may have stemmed from an interest in the future of his collection; Wise was prepared to discuss the matter, but without committing himself. Socially, he was known to be &#145;very genial, if unrefined, in character as in aspect&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In the book trade, for which he sometimes expressed contempt despite dealing unobtrusively himself, he was not much liked; the trade had its own suspicions of his character and marketing methods. It was this that ultimately betrayed him. Instead of destroying the unsold copies of the forgeries (as urged to do by Buxton Forman), Wise sold them in 1910&#150;12 to Herbert Gorfin, a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; who had set up as a bookseller. Gorfin sold them in modest quantities throughout the 1920s, and it was his evidence that led the two young scholarly booksellers John Carter and Graham Pollard&#151;already aware, thanks to their bibliographic and forensic researches, of the suspect nature of the pamphlets&#151;to Wise as their source and manufacturer. The nature of their evidence was beyond Wise's comprehension, but experience had taught him that attack was the best form of defence. Carter and Pollard were not deterred, however, and <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</span> (the title a conscious echo of Edmond Malone's demolition of William Henry Ireland's forgeries) came out in June 1934. It pointed to Wise, though for legal reasons it did not name him. He was not without apologists, including an amused George Bernard Shaw, who saw the forgeries as a prank on collectors. Wise, however, offered no convincing refutation of the charges; privately, he was persuaded to resign from the Roxburghe Club on the grounds of ill health. This excuse, at least, was genuine; his wife, his doctors, and his lawyers protected him from further harassment, and he died at his home in Hampstead on 13 May 1937. Wise's will was proved at over &pound;138,000; the Ashley Library, strong in nineteenth-century literary manuscripts as well as printed items, was sold by his executors to the British Museum for &pound;66,000.<br>
<br>The full tale of Wise's deceit, including the involvement of Buxton Forman (the evidence for which was inexplicably suppressed by the American collector Carl H. Pforzheimer), has taken many years to emerge. More, doubtless, remains to be discovered. The story goes beyond the forgeries and the damage to the British Museum's rare books: many of his reprints would now be regarded as piracies. It may be some small excuse for his forgeries that &#145;reprinting&#146; (a lax term) was then considered a venial infringement of copyright, but none can be offered for his thefts from the British Museum, nor for the inaccuracies, whether deliberate or negligent, that appear in his works of reference. Wise was both a careless and a dishonest bibliographer, and the errors in these works, and the many more in the five-volume catalogue (1920) of the Wrenn collection that he also compiled, mean that they are now merely of historic interest. On the other hand, Carter and Pollard's <span class="italic">Enquiry</span> is now seen as a seminal work in bibliography. In order to complete their case against the forgers they made pioneering use of techniques such as the close analysis of typographical design, and of successive methods of making paper, thus proving that the pamphlets could not have been printed at the dates given in the false imprints. Ironically, this has turned out to be Wise's most important contribution to bibliography. Apart from that, his own hope of immortality rests in the books and manuscripts shelf-marked &#145;Ashley&#146;, preserved in the British Library.<br>
