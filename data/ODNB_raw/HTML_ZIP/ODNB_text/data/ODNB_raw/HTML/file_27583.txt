<span class="headword">Tours,  Berthold</span>  (1838&#150;1897), <span class="occ">composer and music editor</span>, whose baptismal name was Bartolomeus, was born on 17 December 1838 in Rotterdam, the son of Bartolomeus Tours, organist of the church of St Laurent in that city. He was a pupil of, and assistant to, his father and also studied under J. J. H. Verhulst; later he became a student at the conservatories of Brussels and (in 1857) Leipzig. After accompanying the music-loving Prince Yury Galitzin to Russia, he remained there in the prince's service from January 1859 to April 1861. He then migrated to London, where he remained for the rest of his life, though he retained his Dutch nationality. In June 1868 he married Susan Elizabeth Taylor, a native of Hackney; they had a daughter and five sons.<br>
<br>Besides writing and teaching, Tours played the violin in various theatre and concert orchestras, and in 1862 joined the orchestra of the Royal Italian Opera at Covent Garden. He also held the post of organist at St Helen's, Bishopsgate (1864&#150;5), St Peter's, Stepney (1865&#150;7), and the Swiss church in Soho (1867&#150;79). In 1872 he joined the editorial staff of the music publishing house of Novello, Ewer &amp; Co., as assistant initially to Joseph Barnby and then, from 1875, to John Stainer. In 1877 he became chief editor, an influential position which he held until his death and in which he was able to use his critical acumen, judgement, and perseverance to considerable effect. For Novello he made many piano reductions from full scores of operas, oratorios, and the like, and he was himself a prolific composer of services, anthems, songs, and instrumental pieces. He also produced a <span class="italic">Primer of the Violin</span> (1879) for Novello that was highly regarded. Of his instrumental compositions, the <span class="italic">Gavotte moderne en ut</span> (1870) achieved some popularity, but it was above all for his morning and evening service in F (1885) that he became esteemed as a composer. However, the currency of his compositions faded with that of Victorian music generally. According to his obituary in the <span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, Tours was a modest, retiring man and a natural editor, being &#145;learned, laborious and accurate in a remarkable degree&#146;. He died at his home, 26 Rivercourt Road, Ravenscourt Park, on 11 March 1897 and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>His fourth son and fifth child, <a name="cosubject_52400"></a><span class="headword">Frank Edward Tours</span>  (1877&#150;1963), <span class="occ">music director and composer</span>, was born on 1 September 1877 at 210 The Grove, Hammersmith. He received musical training from his father and at the Royal College of Music from Charles Stanford, Walter Parratt, and Frederick Bridge. He was organist at St John's, Hammersmith, and, after conducting Stanford's opera <span class="italic">Shamus O'Brien</span> in 1897, for several years musical director at Daly's, the Prince of Wales's, Gaiety, Aldwych, and other theatres. He contributed additional numbers to numerous Edwardian musical shows, collaborated with Paul A. Rubens on <span class="italic">The Dairymaids</span> (1906), and composed the score of <span class="italic">The Dashing Little Duke</span> (1909). He also wrote many independent ballads, of which it was above all his setting of Kipling's &#145;Mother o' Mine&#146; (1903) that made his name as a composer and which has remained his most performed work. He collaborated closely with Jerome Kern in the latter's early days in London, and from 1912 Tours began to divide his time between London and New York. During the 1920s he was for a time conductor at the Plaza Picture Theatre in Lower Regent Street, but increasingly he concentrated on work in the USA. He conducted on Broadway for several editions of the <span class="italic">Ziegfeld Follies</span> as well as for George M. Cohan and other American impresarios. A companionable, witty <i>bon vivant</i>, Tours was regarded by his friends as a confirmed bachelor until, in his mid-forties, he married an American, with whom he had six daughters and a son. With the coming of musical films he moved to Hollywood, and he spent the final years of his life as an orchestral consultant to various film companies. He died in Los Angeles on 2 February 1963.<br>
