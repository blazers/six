<span class="headword">Thorn,  William <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Wilhelm]</span></span>  (1780&#150;1843), <span class="occ">army officer and cartographer</span>, was born on 22 May 1780 in Neuwied, near Koblenz, Germany, the youngest of five sons and one daughter born to master tailor Johann Philipp Thorn (1733&#150;1798), whose second wife, Anna Catharina Singmeister, of Heddesdorf, was William Thorn's mother. After attending local schools he came about 1796 under the patronage of Major George Gordon, deputy inspector-general of foreign corps serving with HM forces on the continent, and it was this connection which determined his subsequent career. He began his military education in England, purchasing a cornetcy in 1799 in the 29th light dragoons, to which Gordon had transferred, and joined the regiment in India. Promoted lieutenant in 1801, he saw much action in the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803&#150;6) and distinguished himself in 1803 at the battle of Laswari in which he was also wounded. He was promoted captain in 1807 and was brigade major to the cantonment of Bangalore, Mysore, until in November 1810 he accompanied the expedition against French-held Mauritius, where he saw action before returning to India in 1811.<br>
<br>That year Thorn took part in the expedition to Java. Despite being wounded while attacking the French at Weltevreden (Gambir, central Jakarta), he took part in the main assault on Fort Cornelis. He was thanked in public orders by Sir Samuel Auchmuty, the leader of the expedition, and, after the conquest of Java was complete, he was appointed deputy quartermaster-general of the British forces in Java and promoted brevet major.<br>
<br>In 1812 Thorn served with distinction and was commended for his part in actions in Sumatra and Java. He stayed in Java, making a geographical study tour of the island, but ill health obliged him to resign his staff appointment in 1814 and he returned to Europe where he spent six months writing his <span class="italic">Memoir of the Conquest of Java</span> (1815). Thorn left England to fight at Waterloo and after peace was declared returned to Germany. He is believed to have married Johanna Maria Giese in Wiesbaden in September 1815. They settled in Neuwied where he immersed himself in local affairs, becoming an active member of the local Lutheran church, helping its school and founding a society which succeeding in erecting a bridge over the Rhine at Neuwied which opened in 1817 and which was of great use to the local inhabitants. He continued to write, publishing <span class="italic">A Memoir of Major-General Sir R. R. Gillespie</span>, anonymously in 1816 and <span class="italic">A Memoir of the War in India</span> in 1818, of which French and German editions were published in 1818 and 1819 respectively. He was put on half pay in 1818, breveted lieutenant-colonel in 1819, and resigned in 1825. For his services he was made a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1832.<br>
<br>At various stages of his army career Thorn had had responsibility for surveying and map making, and his three books all contained maps and plans. He continued to make maps in retirement, notably for the house of Wied, since he counted Prince Maximilian of Wied a personal friend. He published a map of the possessions of the princely house in 1824 and contributed a map and geographical notes to Prince Maximilian's <span class="italic">Reise in das innere Nord-America</span> (3 vols., 1839&#150;41), which is best known for the engravings of Native American life by Karl Bodmer, the prince's travelling companion, and which went through numerous editions in German, French, and particularly English. After a brief illness Thorn died of apoplexy on 29 November 1843, leaving a widow and six children. He was buried in the cemetery in Neuwied, later renamed the Julius Remy Friedhof.<br>
