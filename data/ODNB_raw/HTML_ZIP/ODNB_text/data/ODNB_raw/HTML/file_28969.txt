<span class="headword">Weekes,  Henry</span>  (1807&#150;1877), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 14 January 1807 in the parish of St Andrew, Canterbury, the son of Capon Weekes (1778/9&#150;1848), a banker's clerk, and his first wife, Mary Pearson (1778/9&#150;1816). After attending the King's School at Canterbury he was apprenticed in 1822 to William Behnes, a talented but chaotic London sculptor. A year later he entered the Royal Academy Schools, and won a silver medal in 1826 for the best model from the antique. Having completed his apprenticeship in 1827, he became a studio assistant to the fashionable sculptor Francis Chantrey, who provided him with a house and studio. Chantrey encouraged Weekes to work on his own account and passed clients on to him. At Chantrey's request, on his death Weekes took over his studio and completed his unfinished sculptures, notably the equestrian bronze statue of the duke of Wellington (1841&#150;4; Royal Exchange) for the City of London. Working for a famous sculptor identified him&#151;reassuringly for many potential patrons&#151;as an approved disciple, but this closeness did not advance his standing with contemporary critics.<br>
<br>From his home county, Kent, came Weekes's early commissions: a sundial base for the Dane John Garden at Canterbury (exh. RA, 1829) and busts of Lord Harris of Seringapatam and Harris's son-in-law Stephen Lushington, MP for Canterbury and governor of Madras from 1827 to 1835 (exh. RA, 1834), for the Canterbury Philosophical Society. These connections led to a series of impressive Indian commissions, notably&#151;in St George's Cathedral, Madras&#151;a statue of Stephen Lushington's son James (exh. RA, 1836) and a monument to John Dent (<i>d</i>. 1845), who is shown with his Indian secretary under a palm-leaf cresting.<br>
<br>Weekes's reputation for portraiture&#151;his forte&#151;was established with the first bust made of Queen Victoria following her accession (exh. RA, 1838; priv. coll.), which she commissioned as a birthday present for her mother, the duchess of Kent. It combines typical Chantrey touches&#151;parted lips, as if speaking, and meticulously modelled hair&#151;with Behnes's sensitivity to the innocence of youth. Weekes held that the primary objective of portraiture is &#145;to give the eye permanently that which no history or biography will be able hereafter thoroughly to convey to the imagination&#146;  (Weekes, <span class="italic">Prize Treatise</span>, 58). He often hit this target. Of the 124 works he exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1828 and 1877 over 100 were portrait busts or statues, the later ones being larger, more imposing, and more broadly modelled. His diploma work following his election as a Royal Academician in 1863 was a bust of Joseph Henry Green (RA), president of the Royal College of Surgeons and professor of anatomy at the academy&#151;a tactful choice, as between 1853 and 1867 the college ordered six busts of members costing around &pound;110 each. Such commissions enabled Weekes to leave the substantial sum of nearly &pound;30,000 at his death.<br>
<br>Understatement, humanity, and technical excellence&#151;all outstanding Chantrey qualities&#151;also characterize Weekes's church monuments, well illustrated by his acknowledged masterpiece, the monument to Samuel Whitbread and Lady Elizabeth Whitbread at Cardington, Bedfordshire (exh. RA, 1849). The couple, modelled in high relief, devoutly kneel, she leaning affectionately on his shoulder. Weekes met the fashion for historic figures in period dress with skill and intelligence. His output in this genre is impressive and includes Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley for George Gilbert Scott's Martyrs' Memorial (1841) in Oxford; a monumental seated Francis Bacon (1845), for Trinity College, Cambridge; a pensive John Hunter (exh. RA, 1864), based on the portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, for the Royal College of Surgeons, London; <span class="italic">William Harvey</span> (model exh. RA, 1864), for the new University Museum, Oxford; and a swagger Charles II, complete with spaniel (model exh. RA, 1869), for the Palace of Westminster, now in the central criminal court, Old Bailey.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Weekes developed a more personal style, leaving Chantrey's shadow. He tackled ideal figures and attempted to revive the classical style by introducing naturalistic detail and taking a more pictorial approach. <span class="italic">The Suppliant</span> (exh. RA, 1850), his first publicly exhibited work in this vein, secured his election as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1851. <span class="italic">Resting after a Run</span>, a marble statue depicting the daughter of Frederick J. Reed with a hoop (exh. Great Exhibition, 1851; ex Sothebys, New York, 26 May 1994), portrays childhood itself as much as the individual girl. His ideal figures had some success with patrons: a <span class="italic">Sardanapalus</span> (exh. RA, 1861; Mansion House) was ordered by the corporation of London. The monument, commissioned by their son, to Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (exh. RA, 1853; priory church, Christchurch, Hampshire) is Weekes's outstanding work in his new manner and earned plaudits from the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. Touches of naturalistic detail, such as the seaweed wrapped around the poet's arm and the broken rocks, evoke the beach where his drowned body was washed ashore.<br>
<br>Weekes's most ambitious later commission (after John Gibson's refusal to participate) was to carve <span class="italic">Manufactures</span>, one of four marble groups representing the industrial arts, in 1864 for Scott's Albert Memorial (finished by April 1870). The genius of <span class="italic">Manufactures</span> holds an hourglass, symbolizing the importance of time to industry, and is offered cloth by a young weaver; alongside, an ironworker (modelled on the Farnese <span class="italic">Hercules</span>) stands by his anvil and a potter exhibits his wares. This group, though well received, highlights the dilemmas facing a sculptor schooled in the neo-classical tradition who attempted a modern subject.<br>
<br>In 1852 Weekes published the essay that had won him a gold medal from the Royal Society of Arts: <span class="italic">The Prize Treatise on the Fine Arts Section of the Great Exhibition of 1851</span>. As well as reviewing the sculpture in the exhibition he gives a rare account of the practicalities of bronze-casting and marble-carving. To some themes&#151;the issue of modern dress, Roubiliac's genius, the differing roles of portrait sculptors and those of ideal works, and the importance of education to sculptors&#151;he returns in the eighteen lectures that he delivered following his election as professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy in 1869 (published posthumously in 1880). Besides the usual theoretical issues&#151;beauty, style, taste, and composition&#151;he discusses in three lectures the importance of Sir Joshua Reynolds's teaching and, in one masterly lecture, the characters of Chantrey, Behnes, and Gibson. His intelligence, technical skill, and moderate stylistic innovation kept him in steady demand. John Ernest Weekes, his son and the author of a brief memoir prefacing the lectures, describes him as an earnest and thoughtful man with a simple, kindly manner. Weekes died of heart disease, at his home, 96 Buckingham Palace Road, London, on 28 May 1877 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
