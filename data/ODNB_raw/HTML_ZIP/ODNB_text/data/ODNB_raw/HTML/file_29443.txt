<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Willes, Sir  John</span>  (1685&#150;1761), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 28 November 1685 at Bishop's Itchington, Warwickshire, the son of John Willes (1647/8&#150;1700), rector of Bishop's Itchington and canon of Lichfield, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir William Walker, mayor of Oxford. His younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61903/', "Edward Willes (1694&#150;1773)")</script> became bishop of Bath and Wells. Willes was educated at Lichfield grammar school, and on 28 November 1700 matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford. He graduated BA in 1704, and proceeded MA in 1707, BCL in 1710, and DCL in 1715. He was a fellow of All Souls from 1705 to 1719. Having been admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 20 January 1709, he was called to the bar on 17 June 1713. Lord Carteret related how Willes had spent part of his time at Oxford writing libels against the tory ministry and that only Carteret's intervention had saved him from the pillory. Later Willes wrote: &#145;I was not wanting in my poor endeavours to promote his Majesty's interest at a time when it was not only very unfashionable, but very dangerous to do so&#146;  (Campbell, 6.114&#150;15) and on 1 July 1718, after only five years at the bar, he was rewarded by being appointed king's counsel. On 11 May 1719 he was called to the bench of Lincoln's Inn. Soon afterwards he married Margaret Brewster, of a Worcestershire family; they had four sons and four daughters. He followed the Oxford circuit, and in 1720 he had a moderate practice in king's bench, chancery, and the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Despite his narrow escape at Oxford, like many ambitious barristers Willes saw politics and government service as the keys to his advancement. In 1719 he corresponded with Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland and first lord of the Treasury, and in 1721 he came under investigation during the Minehead by-election for causing the writ to be sent to a candidate before the result had been determined. In 1722 he stood for Bishop's Castle, in Shropshire, but withdrew from the contest on the understanding that the borough patron, James Brydges, first duke of Chandos, would find him a seat elsewhere. Chandos arranged for him to stand for Launceston, in Cornwall; he was defeated but was returned to the Commons on petition on 17 March 1724. He was a loyal supporter of Sir Robert Walpole; though there is no record of him speaking in the parliament of 1722&#150;7 it is said that he assisted in the proceedings against Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester. He applied to become solicitor-general in April 1726, on the death of Sir Clement Wearg, while so doing reminding Lord Chancellor King of his loyal services, but King favoured Charles Talbot instead. However, he was appointed second justice on the Chester circuit in May. By taking office he vacated his seat at Launceston, but on 9 June he became a member for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis at a by-election, following the expulsion of John Ward, a convicted forger. The election was expensive, and at the 1727 election Willes was returned for West Looe, a Cornish seat in the gift of the ministry, where he remained until he left the Commons in 1737. In February 1729 he was promoted to chief justice of Chester. He was also active on the governing bench of Lincoln's Inn, being a member of the committee that met with the benchers of the Middle Temple in 1730 to agree a uniform method for calling candidates to the bar.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1733 Willes succeeded Yorke as attorney-general and on the same day was granted a patent of precedence for life next after the attorney-general&#151;an unusual insurance policy. He was not knighted at this time, however, and he did not prosecute in any of the published state trials during the three years that he was a law officer. His only recorded parliamentary speech before his promotion was firmly whig, opposing (unsuccessfully) the resolution of 30 March 1732 that the sale of the Radcliffe annuity and the Derwentwater estates, forfeited to the crown when James Radcliffe, third earl of Derwentwater, was attainted in 1716, should be declared void. As attorney-general he spoke for the ministry; in March 1734 he eloquently outlined the case for the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span> against a motion for its repeal, arguing that &#145;I believe it cannot be shewn that so many good laws have passed in any number of years, as have passed since septennial parliaments took place&#146; and insisting that with frequent elections &#145;a vast encouragement would be given to drunkenness and idleness among all ranks of men&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 9.436). He also supported the subsidy to Denmark on 28 February 1735. On 28 January 1737 he succeeded Sir Thomas Reeve as chief justice of the common pleas, having been knighted five days earlier. But he remained ambitious, and after Walpole's fall in 1742 he sought to attract new patrons. In 1745 he offered to organize a volunteer regiment of lawyers to guard the royal family during the king's absence abroad, but his scheme was rejected. According to Horace Walpole he refused the proposal of becoming lord chancellor in February 1746, when William Pulteney, earl of Bath, and his old friend Granville (formerly Carteret) formed their short-lived ministry, but after this date he allied with the friends of Frederick, prince of Wales, and moved his two sons into opposition against the Pelham ministry. Francis North, seventh Baron North, supported the entry of Willes's eldest son, John, into parliament, at Banbury in 1746, while Thomas Pitt brought his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63079/', "Edward Willes (bap. 1723, d. 1787)")</script>, in for Old Sarum in 1747, both as supporters of Frederick. The prince envisaged Willes becoming lord chancellor in his reign but this prospect, which must have appeared tantalisingly close, disappeared when Frederick died suddenly, in 1751.<br>
<br>Though he was an able lawyer Willes presided over an era of stagnation in the court of common pleas. Dudley Ryder said that he offended the attorneys, who ultimately governed the flow of business, by attending in court only &#145;by fits and starts&#146;. In 1754 Hardwicke believed that the &#145;court of C[ommon] B[ench] is in danger of being lost to the public&#146;  (Ryder, diary, 19 Dec 1754, doc. 27, pt 5a, 19&#150;20). At this time Willes proposed the abolition of the serjeants' monopoly in common pleas as a means of reviving business there, but the scheme was rejected by a meeting of all the judges, and he was accused of wanting to open the court for the benefit of his son Edward, a rising barrister. However, as lord chief justice he was involved in some important crown cases. He was one of the judges who tried the Jacobite rebels at St Margaret's Hill in 1746, and on 29 October it was Willes who ruled against the plea to the jurisdiction made by Alexander and James Kinloch on the ground of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 18.395&#150;401). He also presided at the Old Bailey in the abortive proceedings for perjury of September 1753 that arose out of the alleged abduction of Elizabeth Canning. Indeed he was on the bench at the sensational trial of Canning herself, held in April and early May 1754, but the recorder of London summed up, and Willes was not present for the guilty verdict, when two of the jurors presented affidavits maintaining that it was not given according to their consciences. The issue was referred to the next sessions, and on 30 May Willes ruled against a new trial, taking the opportunity to inveigh against the popular collections carried on for Canning, which he said would render a sentence of imprisonment &#145;rather a diversion than a punishment&#146;. Several of the aldermen on the bench recommended her for mercy in open court but Willes declared that &#145;he thought her notoriously guilty&#146;, and on taking a vote the majority of the bench followed his lead in sentencing her to seven years' transportation  (ibid., 19. 672&#150;3). Despite the low level of litigation in common pleas, Willes's greatest contribution to the law was probably the series of reports that he compiled recording civil cases decided before him as chief justice. These were unpublished at his death; a selection, edited by Charles Durnford, appeared in 1799. The reports have been called the most authoritative of the reign of George II; Holdsworth commented that they demonstrate Willes's &#145;complete mastery of legal principles and the complex rules of procedure and pleading&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 12.448).<br>
<br>Following Hardwicke's resignation in 1756 Willes was appointed chief commissioner of the great seal on 19 November. He was offered the great seal as lord keeper on the formation of the Pitt&#150;Newcastle administration in 1757 but held out for a peerage. George II, who was still offended by Willes's alliance with Frederick's court in the late 1740s, refused, and he was passed over in favour of Robert Henley. Willes remained chief justice until his death, at his home in Bloomsbury Square, London, on 15 December 1761; he was buried on 24 December at Bishop's Itchington, Warwickshire. Despite his obvious talents, ultimately his judicial career was probably damaged by an unwillingness to dissemble his personal sentiments, especially his ambition; certainly Hardwicke regarded him as an inveterate trouble-maker. He was also notorious for womanizing. Dudley Ryder said of him in 1755: &#145;He seems to me to be so agitated within that he has no ease but when in motion&#146;  (Ryder, notebook, p. 26). His son Edward became a puisne justice of king's bench in 1768.<br>
