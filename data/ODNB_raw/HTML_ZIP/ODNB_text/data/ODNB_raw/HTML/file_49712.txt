<span class="headword">Heron, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1809&#150;1889), <span class="occ">lawyer and town clerk</span>, was born in Deansgate House, Manchester, the fourth of the ten children of James Holt Heron (1777&#150;1847), a cotton merchant, on 3 January 1809 (or, according to one source, in January 1807). Heron was educated at the Moravian school, Fairfield, and Mr Hulme's school, Burnley. He was articled to John Hampson, a Manchester attorney, and afterwards became a pupil in London of Nassau Senior, the political economist. Heron was admitted as an attorney in 1830 at the age of twenty-one, and set up practice with his brother William at 21 Princess Street in Manchester. In 1838, after the battle for the incorporation of the city had been fought and won, Richard Cobden proposed Joseph Heron for the new post of town clerk. This was a position which Heron held for forty years, earning the epithet &#145;father of the town clerks in England&#146;.<br>
<br>An acknowledged authority on English municipal law, Heron was reputed never to have lost a case for the corporation and was recognized as one of the leading parliamentary lawyers of his day. As an attorney he was precluded from pleading his cause directly before a parliamentary committee&#151;that task fell to a barrister. Heron, however, always instructed the counsel (whom he had employed) to call him as a witness, and in this way he was able to plead and invariably win the case in hand. In 1858, in recognition of the prominent part he played in procuring the <span class="roman">Mersey Conservancy and Docks Act</span>, which effectively stopped Liverpool benefiting from the taxation of shipping houses in Lancashire, Heron was awarded a silver casket and the sum of &pound;5000. His salary as town clerk was raised from &pound;1500 to &pound;2500 per annum, and after his retirement in 1877 he continued to receive &pound;1500 per annum until his death. Knighted by the queen in 1869, Heron was acknowledged by Manchester borough council in a formal resolution which testified to the high character, ability, and long services rendered that had earned him the honour.<br>
<br>Joseph Heron, sometimes known as Joe Heron, was a flamboyant figure. In his youth he was described as &#145;a swell&#146;, who wore kid gloves, tight boots, glossy curls, and all the adornments of a ladies' man. Listening to Joseph Heron on public occasions was said to have been like hearing the opinions of a consummate man of the world. He had the ability to express the most complex issues in a clear and colloquial manner. It was claimed that many a man entered the council chamber with the purpose of teaching Joe Heron his place but was converted to full acquiescence by Heron's undoubted eloquence. In answer to an exasperated councillor who exclaimed &#145;What right have you to speak&#151;what ward do you represent?&#146;, Heron retorted &#145;A larger ward than yours, sir&#151;I represent the entire city!&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Faces and Places</span>, 1889&#150;90).<br>
<br>Joseph Heron eventually married in 1881, at the age of seventy-two. His bride was Susan Preston Willert (<i>b</i>. 1809/10), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beale, of Headington Hill, Oxford, the widow of an old friend and colleague. During the winter months they resided in the Hotel Californie at Cannes, where Heron died on 23 December 1889. According to his wishes he was buried in the cemetery at Cannes.<br>
