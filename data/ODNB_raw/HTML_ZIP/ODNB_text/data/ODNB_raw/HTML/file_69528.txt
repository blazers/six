<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lestor,  Joan</span>, Baroness Lestor of Eccles  (1927&#150;1998), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 13 November 1927 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the daughter of Charles Lestor, journalist, actor, and political activist, and his wife, Esther, a textile worker who had been a shop steward in the Garment Workers' Union in east London. At the time of her birth her father was working for the union bulletin of the International Workers of the World (the &#145;Wobblies&#146;). The family moved to the UK when she was five, and her father became a leading member of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.<br>
<br>Lestor attended Blaenafon Secondary School, Monmouthshire, and William Morris Secondary School, Walthamstow, before training as a teacher at Goldsmiths' College, London (where she was awarded a diploma in sociology). Her experience in the education system of meeting people with different views made her challenge the Marxism of her family, and at twenty-four she found an ideological home in the Labour Party. She became a primary school teacher in Walthamstow, and on 5 January 1952 married John McGregor (<i>b</i>. 1927/8), book salesman, son of John McGregor, railway driver. There were no children of the marriage, which was dissolved shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>In 1958 Lestor began ten years of service on Wandsworth council, where she began her life work of developing pre-school facilities for children, in the provision of which Britain lagged behind other developed countries. In 1962 she was elected to the London county council and the executive committee of the London Labour Party. Meanwhile she had left primary school teaching in order to run her own day nursery school in south London. In 1964 she fought her first parliamentary election, for West Lewisham, almost taking the constituency from the Conservatives. In the following year she was adopted as Labour candidate for Eton and Slough, which she won in 1966, holding the seat until Labour's disastrous election defeat of 1983.<br>
<br>As a frequent speaker at the party conference and a representative of the young, progressive side of the party, Lestor was a natural choice for office, and in October 1969 Harold Wilson appointed her under-secretary at the Department of Education and Science, where she remained until the government's defeat in June 1970. After Labour's return in February 1974 she was made under-secretary at the Foreign Office, with responsibility for Africa, a position that she held for fifteen months with praise from career diplomats for her &#145;enthusiasm, interest and easy informality&#146; on foreign visits  (<span class="italic">Castle Diaries</span>, 403), but in June 1975 she was removed from the post; the decision shocked her senior colleague Barbara Castle, who thought that she had been &#145;a breath of fresh air in that airless institution&#146;  (ibid., 416). It was widely suspected (including by Lestor herself) that foreign secretary James Callaghan had lobbied for her removal because she did not fit in with his conservative view of world affairs, a claim that he denied. She was moved back to education, a post from which she resigned in February 1976 over cuts in the education budget, remarking in her resignation letter that &#145;investment in education is as important as investment in industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>).<br>
<br>Her dramatic presence and authentic left-wing conscience made Lestor a &#145;darling of the party&#146; and a national executive committee (NEC) member from 1967 to 1982 (chairman, 1977&#150;8). Like others of similar views her fortunes were linked with those of the crown prince of the left, Tony Benn. She was part of Benn's &#145;alternative cabinet&#146; of advisers until the end of the 1970s, but abstained in the deputy leadership contest of 1981, which was the litmus test of commitment for party activists. The result was the loss of her NEC seat; she regained it in 1987, serving on the committee thereafter for another ten years. In Slough her concern for racial equality helped to establish a firm Labour base among Asian voters. She was a vice-president of the anti-apartheid movement, at one time an editor of the anti-fascist magazine <span class="italic">Searchlight</span>, and consistently campaigned against racism.<br>
<br>In her four years out of parliament from 1983 Lestor worked for the World Development Movement, and was able to carry forward her campaign for the rights of children when she was sponsored by several trade unions to set up a unit to look at child abuse, including sexual abuse, a subject that was not receiving the official attention that it merited. She was also ahead of her time in her focus on teenage pregnancy and poor nutritional standards in young children. She returned to the House of Commons in 1987, as MP for Eccles, and was a shadow spokesman on such issues as children, young offenders, the family, and overseas aid. She retired from the shadow cabinet in 1996 because of ill health. Her last contribution, in 1997, was in a debate on child poverty. She left the Commons at the 1997 general election and was ennobled as Baroness Lestor of Eccles later in that year.<br>
<br>Lestor's red hair and strapping physique meant that her physical presence as much as her forthright views impressed themselves upon her listeners. Following the dissolution of her marriage to John McGregor she did not marry again, but adopted two children, David in 1967 and Susan in 1969, thus pioneering the adoption of children by single women. She cited &#145;playing with children&#146; when asked to name a hobby  (<span class="italic">WWW</span>). She died at the Trinity Hospice, Clapham, London, on 27 March 1998, of motor neurone disease. She was survived by her two adopted children.<br>
