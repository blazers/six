<span class="headword">Makemie,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1658&#150;1708), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born near Ramelton, co. Donegal, Ireland. His parents, of Scottish ancestry, are unknown; he had at least two brothers and one sister. Described as blue-eyed and brown-haired, with a fair complexion, he was educated by a local schoolmaster and in February 1676 enrolled in the University of Glasgow. He appeared before Ulster's Presbytery of Laggan on 28 January 1680, was licensed to preach in late 1681 or early 1682, and was ordained in 1682. Restrictions on Presbyterians in Ulster, and an appeal from Maryland's council to his presbytery for ministers, attracted him to the Chesapeake region.<br>
<br>Makemie itinerated along the coasts of Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina and in Barbados. For a time he ministered in Virginia and by 1687 had a residence there in Accomack county where he began to acquire land and engage in trade. About 1689 he travelled to London, largely to recruit additional ministerial manpower. In Virginia, in 1692, he was visited by George Keith, a Quaker apologist eager to dispute a catechism for children that Makemie had published (no copy of which is known to have survived). Makemie published a verbose theological riposte, <span class="italic">An Answer to George Keith's Libel</span> (1694). In 1692 he visited Pennsylvania and preached one of the first Presbyterian sermons heard in Philadelphia. By this time he had established trading interests in Barbados and divided his time between the island and Virginia. As early as 1690 he had received from the governor of Barbados a dissenter's licence to preach and by 1693 or 1694 was living there. From Barbados he wrote <span class="italic">Truths in a True Light</span> (1699), an attempt to build ecumenical bridges to Anglicans on the island and in the Chesapeake. This pamphlet called for protestants to sink their differences in the face of Roman Catholic activity.<br>
<br>Makemie was probably financed during these years by William Anderson, a wealthy Virginia merchant and Accomack county landowner, and some time between 1687 and 1698 he married Anderson's daughter Naomi, about ten years his junior. They had two children, Elizabeth and Anne. Upon Anderson's death in 1698 Makemie and his wife inherited the bulk of his wealth and returned to Virginia from Barbados. The following year Makemie was granted a dissenter's licence on the basis of the one received in Barbados, and registered his home for preaching.<br>
<br>Makemie proved adept at managing both plantation and commercial affairs and added to his inherited wealth by purchase and trade; over the next eight years Virginia records regarding his activities almost exclusively reflected such interests. By 1704 he had become the second largest landholder in Accomack county. In that year he visited England, where the Presbyterian Fund of London promised financial support for two further ministers. Makemie was reacting against the increasing Anglican activity in the American colonies nurtured by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. He was also deeply concerned about the lack of civic growth in Virginia and Maryland. Wishing to warn fellow colonists of the pitfalls of scattered settlements, while in London he published <span class="italic">A plain and friendly perswasive to the inhabitants of Virginia and Maryland, for promoting towns and cohabitation</span> (1705). By uniting in important towns the Chesapeake inhabitants could encourage economic and cultural development, thereby causing self-interest to &#145;truckle to the Common Good&#146;  (Schlenther, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 139).<br>
<br>Upon his 1705 return to the Chesapeake with two ministerial recruits Makemie experienced the new Anglican aggressiveness, initiated by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, first-hand. He quickly moved to organize the first American presbytery, which met in Philadelphia in the spring of 1706, comprising the seven Presbyterian ministers then labouring in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania. Its formation marked the formal foundation of the Presbyterian Church in America, and Makemie was elected its first moderator. Early in 1707 he and another minister visited New York to attempt to broaden the presbytery's scope. There they were confronted by the royal governor, Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, who had been actively undermining the rights of the colony's non-Anglicans. Makemie preached in a private home, for which Cornbury ordered his arrest. If various contemporary reports of Cornbury's regular practice of parading in women's clothes were true, Makemie's distaste for the governor was probably flavoured by considerations more than ecclesiastical.<br>
<br>In June Makemie appeared in court. Ever relishing the taste of debate, he participated extensively in his own defence, at first basing it on his two licences to preach&#151;thereby claiming protection under parliament's 1689 <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span>. However, he shifted his stance to denying the need for toleration in colonies where the Church of England had not been legally established. Such was the case, he claimed, in New York. The union of the English and Scottish parliaments just a month before the trial facilitated this alteration in his argument: Presbyterians, he said, &#145;have now since the Union, a National Establishment in Great Britain, as nighly related and annexed unto the Crown of England, as the Church of England themselves&#146;  (Schlenther, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 225). The presiding judge noted that this was the first such trial in the American colonies, and the jury found Makemie innocent. However, the court affixed upon him the trial's entire costs, which so roused popular opinion that the following year the colony's assembly made such a procedure illegal. A beleaguered Cornbury called Makemie a &#145;Jack of all Trades he is a Preacher, a Doctor of Physick, a Merchant, an Attorney &hellip; and, which is worse of all, a Disturber of Governments&#146;  (Schlenther, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 259).<br>
<br>In Boston following his trial, Makemie arranged for the publication of what is probably the earliest extant American Presbyterian sermon, <span class="italic">A Good Conversation</span> (1707)&#151;the preaching of which had led to his imprisonment&#151;and of his anonymous <span class="italic">A Narrative of a New and Unusual American Imprisonment of Two Presbyterian Ministers</span> (1707). This last and most important of his publications brought to public view the trial that served as a milestone in religious toleration in the American colonies. Cotton Mather wrote:<blockquote>That brave man, Mr. Makemie, has after a famous Trial at N. York &hellip; triumphed over the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, and the other Poenal Lawes for the Ch. of England. Without permitting the Matter to come so far as to Pleading the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span>, he has compelled an Acknowledgement that those Lawes aforesd &hellip; have nothing to do with the Plantations. (Schlenther, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 17)</blockquote>Makemie died at some time between 10 June and 4 August 1708, probably at his Accomack home, and it is likely that he was buried on the bank of Holden's Creek. His estate comprised over 5000 acres of land, thirty-three slaves, and a library of 1000 volumes. Called the father of American Presbyterianism, he was its chief early exponent, its leading literary apologist, the main defender of its liberties, the foremost overseer of its congregations, and the moving force in its formal organization. Perhaps of necessity a polemical man, his theology was strictly orthodox, in the style of seventeenth-century Calvinism.<br>
