<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson,  Anthony Todd</span>  (1778&#150;1849), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 7 January 1778 in Edinburgh, where his parents were temporarily resident, the younger son of Alexander Thomson (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1800), a Scot who held British government appointments in America as postmaster-general for Georgia and as collector of customs for the town of Savannah, and his wife (<i>d</i>. 1779?), the daughter of an American called Spencer. He was named after Anthony Todd, the postmaster of Edinburgh, who was his godfather. Thomson accompanied his parents when they returned to America. When he was about one year of age his mother died, and he was brought up by a relative, Mrs Rennie (or Rainie), whom his father later married. When the American republic was established Alexander Thomson refused to swear allegiance to the new government, and he returned to settle in Edinburgh, where he lived on a pension &#145;in humble circumstances&#146;  (Parkes, xii&#150;xiii).<br>
<br>During his childhood Anthony Thomson acquired an enduring love of nature and the countryside while roaming the hills and fields around Edinburgh. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and, from 1795 to 1797, at Edinburgh University, where his circle of friends included Henry Brougham, Henry Cockburn, and Francis Jeffrey. At the university he helped to finance his studies by working as a Post Office clerk; contrary to most accounts of his life he never graduated. He joined the Speculative Society in 1798 and the Royal Medical Society in 1799.<br>
<br>Thomson considered joining the East India Company but, following the death of his father, he decided upon a medical career. He moved to London, where he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1800, and, with the help of money loaned by his two sisters, he set up a general practice in Sloane Street, Chelsea. His resuscitation of a man dragged from a river seemingly drowned, for which he was awarded a medal by the Humane Society, helped him to transform his struggling practice into a successful one. He also gained a reputation for the care and attention he bestowed on patients. When he retired as a general practitioner in 1826, his practice was worth around &pound;3000 per annum; soon after his death <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> described it as having been &#145;one of the largest and most profitable in London&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancet</span>, 14 July 1849, 46).<br>
<br>Thomson was tall and slim, yet powerful; &#145;even at 70 his figure was as erect and as agile as that of a healthy man at 30&#146;. He had great conversational powers and was &#145;full of information and of racy anecdote&#146;. He eschewed dissemblance and &#145;always expressed his sentiments in strong and vigorous language&#146;  (Clarke, 307). Thomson was twice married. His first marriage, in 1801, was to Christiana <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maxwell (<i>d</i>. 1815), from Dumfriesshire; they had one son, Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1838), who entered the medical profession, and two daughters. His second marriage, in 1820, was to Katherine, the seventh daughter of Thomas Byerley of Etruria, Staffordshire, who was related by marriage to the Wedgwood family [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27319/', "Thomson, Katherine (1797&#150;1862)")</script>]. She drew some of the illustrations for Thomson's books. At his prompting she herself took up writing and achieved success as a biographer and historical novelist; in later life she worked in collaboration with two of her three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27305/', "Henry William Byerley Thomson (1822&#150;1867)")</script>, the jurist, and John, who took holy orders. Their father had advised all three against following medical careers. The marriage also produced five daughters.<br>
<br>While in general practice Thomson helped found the Chelsea, Brompton, and Belgrave Dispensary (in 1812), and an infant school in Chelsea. He lobbied for the passing of the <span class="roman">Apothecaries Act</span> of 1815 and was active in several professional and learned societies. These included the Association of Apothecaries and Surgeon-Apothecaries, the Linnean and Ethnological societies, in both of which he held fellowships, the Medico-Chirurgical Society, the Westminster Medical Society, and the Harveian Medical Society; he also helped to found the Pathological Society of London. Thomson lectured extensively on botanical and medical subjects, at the Pharmaceutical Society, where he held the title of professor of botany, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Thomson was a prolific author from an early age. He published an essay on philosophy and chemistry in 1800, and &#145;Ode to the Memory of Sir Ralph Abercrombie&#146; in the following year. Between 1814 and 1817 he was joint editor, with George Burrows and William Royston, of the <span class="italic">London Medical Repository</span>, to which he contributed many articles. He also published papers in the <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia of Medicine</span>, <span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, which published his &#145;Lectures on medical jurisprudence&#146; (1836&#150;7), and other professional journals. His main books were <span class="italic">A Conspectus of Pharmacopoeias</span> (1810), the <span class="italic">London Dispensatory</span> (1811), both of which went into many editions and were translated into foreign languages, <span class="italic">Medical Statement of the Case of the Princess Charlotte of Wales</span> (1817), <span class="italic">Lectures on the Elements of Botany</span> (1822), <span class="italic">Elements of Materia medica and Therapeutics</span> (1832), which James Fernandez Clarke deemed to be the &#145;best work&#146; on the subject  (Clarke, 305&#150;10), and <span class="italic">The Domestic Management of the Sick-Room</span> (1841). At the time of his death he was writing <span class="italic">A Practical Treatise on Diseases Affecting the Skin</span>, which was completed and edited by E. A. Parkes and published in 1850. Thomson's edited works included the seventh edition of Thomas Bateman's <span class="italic">Practical Synopsis of Cutaneous Diseases</span> (1829), an edition of James Thomson's <span class="italic">The Seasons</span> (1847), and a translation of A. J. Salvarte, <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Magic, Prodigies, and Apparent Miracles</span> (1846).<br>
<br>On 1 May 1824 Thomson was admitted doctor of physic at St Andrews University. In London he moved from Chelsea to 3 Hinde Street, Manchester Square, in 1826; he later resided at 30 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, and at a rented cottage in Kingston upon Thames in Surrey. In 1828 he was appointed the first professor of materia medica and therapeutics at the newly founded London University. In the same year he was awarded the licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. Around this time he became involved in Lord Brougham's Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. In 1832 he was appointed joint professor of medical jurisprudence, a position he had to himself from 1837 to 1849, following the resignation of his fellow postholder, Andrew Amos.<br>
<br>Thomson was also physician to the North London (later University College) Hospital. His time at the hospital was a period of much quarrelling among the medical staff. Thomson, closely allied with Robert Liston, had a particularly poor relationship with John Elliotson. His achievements as a professor included experimental work on the properties of alkaloids and iodides, and he may have invented an important device which became known as the &#145;Gibson spoon&#146;, for administering medicines to unco-operative patients. In 1835 Thomson's health broke down as a result of overwork. It was further impaired by his inhaling chlorine gas while giving a demonstration in the course of a lecture. Up to this point his &#145;industry and energy were truly marvellous&#146;  (Clarke, 307), but for several years afterwards he was obliged greatly to reduce his workload, though he continued to lecture, write, and practise medicine, giving great attention to skin diseases, in which he became a specialist. In 1842, &#145;rather late in life&#146;  (Clarke, 307), he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.<br>
<br>James Fernandez Clarke had a grudging respect for Thomson's erudition and his ability to lecture on materia medica. However, he was scathing about his clinical and pedagogical capabilities. Clarke recalled him as having been &#145;deficient in the faculty of perception&#146;, as well as indecisive in the diagnosis and treatment of cases in his care. An unoriginal lecturer on medical jurisprudence, Thomson's clinical lectures were &#145;heavy and elaborate&#146;. Clarke also maintained that Thomson's &#145;knowledge of physiology and pathology was scarcely up to the level which should have been possessed by a physician in an important hospital&#146;  (Clarke, 305&#150;10).<br>
<br>From autumn 1848 Thomson's health began to decline, and in early 1849 he suffered an attack of bronchitis from which he never fully recovered; he died at Ealing, Middlesex, on 3 July 1849. He had expressed a wish to be buried in a rural location and was interred in the nearby Perivale churchyard on 10 July. The government purchased his materia medica collection for Queen's College, Cork.<br>
