<span class="headword">Ramberg,  Johann Heinrich <span class="st"> [John Henry]</span></span>  (1763&#150;1840), <span class="occ">painter and printmaker</span>, was born at Hanover on 22 July 1763. His father, who was war secretary of the electorate and a lover of art, encouraged his son's early talent. In 1781 he came to England and was introduced to George III, for whom he made many humorous sketches and caricatures. He is said to have been a pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds and Francesco Bartolozzi, and in November 1781 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he studied with Benjamin West under the special protection of George III. In 1784 he gained a silver medal for drawing from the life. He began to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1782, when he sent five drawings, two of which&#151;<span class="italic">The Embarkment</span> and <span class="italic">Good News</span>&#151;were engraved. Between 1784 and 1788 he exhibited further historical and genre subjects. Ramberg made three drawings of the exhibition of 1784 (BM) including <span class="italic">Sir Joshua Reynolds showing the prince the paintings in the exhibition</span>; this, together with <span class="italic">The exhibition of the Royal Academy, 1787</span> and <span class="italic">Portraits of their majesties and the royal family viewing the exhibition of the Royal Academy, 1788</span>, was engraved in line by P. A. Martini. These works are of interest to historians for their record of exhibitions in the Great Room of the Royal Academy in the late eighteenth century. During the 1780s he gave his addresses as 19 Eaton Street, Pimlico, 85 Newman Street, and then 3 Frith Street, Soho.<br>
<br>In 1788, with the help of his royal patron, Ramberg visited the Netherlands, and afterwards Germany and Italy, returning to Hanover in 1792, when he was appointed electoral court painter. In 1789 he painted the curtain (destr.) for the court theatre in Hanover, which he himself etched in 1828, and of which sketches are preserved in the British Museum and in the Kupfertischkabinett, Berlin. While in Dresden in 1790&#150;91 he met Goethe and painted, for the decoration of Carlton House, <span class="italic">Alexander Crossing the Granicus</span>. His other works include literary and historical subjects for book illustrations such as <span class="italic">Olivia, Maria, and Malvolio</span> from <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, engraved by Thomas Ryder for Boydell's Shakspeare Gallery; <span class="italic">The Goldfinches</span> for Macklin's <span class="italic">British Poets</span>; <span class="italic">Public Amusement</span> and <span class="italic">Private Amusement</span>, engraved by William Ward; and <span class="italic">The Departure of Queen Marie-Antoinette and her Family</span>, engraved by J. F. Bolt. He also painted portraits of the princesses Mary, Elizabeth, and Sophia (daughters of George III), and a portrait of Baron Denon, etched by Denon himself. His work as a draughtsman for German almanacs and pocket books extended to more than twenty years, but his best illustrations are those which he himself etched for the narrative cycles <span class="italic">Reineke Fuchs</span> and <span class="italic">Tyll Eulenspiegel</span>, both published in 1826. He became one of the most popular illustrators in Germany and produced drawings for many contemporary writers. He made, from sketches by the Princess Elizabeth, landgravine of Hesse-Homburg, a series of twenty allegorical designs entitled <span class="italic">Genius, Imagination, Phantasie</span>, which were lithographed by Julius Giere and published at Hanover in 1834. Ramberg died at Hanover on 6 July 1840, and was buried in the Gartenkirchhof. Several studies of his satirical caricatures and book illustrations were published in German in the 1960s, and two exhibitions of his work were held in Hanover in 1973 and 1988&#150;9.<br>
