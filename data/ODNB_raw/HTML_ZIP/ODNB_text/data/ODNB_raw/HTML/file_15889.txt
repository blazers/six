<span class="headword">Laing,  John</span>  (1809&#150;1880), <span class="occ">bibliographer</span>, was born on 16 February 1809 at Edinburgh, but grew up at nearby Dalmeny, where his father, also John, was for many years factor to the earl of Rosebery; his mother was Mary Fyfe, of a Banffshire family. He lost the sight of one eye in his youth. After attending the high school in Edinburgh, he took arts classes at Edinburgh University between 1823 and 1826, and divinity classes between 1827 and 1831. Having been licensed as a clergyman by the presbytery of Edinburgh on 5 October 1841, he was ordained assistant and successor to John Robertson, minister of Livingston, Linlithgowshire, on 13 January 1842. At the Disruption in the following year he joined the newly formed Free Church, and continued his ministry in the same parish. On 29 August 1843 he married, at Dalmeny, Catherine Fyfe (<i>d</i>. 16 Feb 1869), daughter of a West India proprietor. There were three daughters: Mary (who died young), Catherine, and Fanny.<br>
<br>In 1845 Laing had a physical, spiritual, and mental collapse and went abroad for a time, becoming a chaplain to the British forces on Gibraltar and Malta. He resigned his parish in March 1847. Late in 1850 he was appointed an assistant librarian at the recently completed New College of the Free Church; in 1854 he became acting librarian following the death of the incumbent, William Rowand, the previous year. This post he held until his own death. Throughout his librarianship the collections grew rapidly and Laing organized the publication of a substantial catalogue of the printed books and manuscripts in 1868. After the death of his friend Samuel Halkett in 1871, the materials collected by the latter for a dictionary of anonymous British literature were entrusted to him, and Laing more than doubled the store. The work, <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature of Great Britain</span>, was published posthumously in four volumes between 1882 and 1888, prepared for the press, apart from the unsatisfactory indexes, by Laing's daughter Catherine. &#145;Halkett and Laing&#146; soon established itself as an invaluable reference work, relied upon for its accuracy and admired for the concise way in which it cited the sources for its attributions. An expanded edition in nine volumes appeared between 1926 and 1962. Laing died in Edinburgh, where he had lived, on 3 April 1880 and was buried in the Grange cemetery there.<br>
