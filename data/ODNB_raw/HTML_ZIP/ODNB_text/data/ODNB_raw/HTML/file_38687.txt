<span class="headword">Grenfell,  Henry Riversdale</span>  (1824&#150;1902), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 5 April 1824, the younger son (in a family of four) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61127/', "Charles Pascoe Grenfell (1790&#150;1867)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61181/', "Grenfell family")</script>], copper merchant, and later Liberal MP, and his wife, Lady Georgiana Molyneux, eldest daughter of the second earl of Sefton. The Grenfell family, originally from Cornwall, had risen to prominence and wealth as the London partners of various copper enterprises during the early industrial revolution, particularly under Grenfell's grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11486/', "Pascoe Grenfell")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61181/', "Grenfell family")</script>].<br>
<br>Grenfell, like his father and brother, was educated at Harrow School (1836&#150;8) and at Christ Church, Oxford (matriculated 1842). A prompt start in the City of the 1840s ended in family disagreements, and Grenfell, under the wing of his Christ Church friend Chichester Fortescue, entered more fully the world of politics and London society. Among his friends he was nicknamed Wigs. He acted as private secretary to Lord Panmure at the War Office, and to Sir Charles Wood at the India Office. He also became an intimate of the &#145;Nuneham set&#146; of Lady Waldegrave, whose notice he wrote for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. He entered parliament, for Stoke, in 1862, but by then his career had veered back towards the City after the untimely death of his brother, Charles, in 1861. Edged out as Liberal candidate at Stoke in 1868, he contested South-West Lancashire with W. E. Gladstone&#151;the first of a series of failures to re-enter parliament. He was for the most part a Liberal of the <i>juste milieu</i>, friend of Italy (see his <span class="italic">Italy</span>, 1863), foe to Governor Eyre. But by 1886 he was a Liberal Unionist, acting in the forefront of City opposition to home rule.<br>
<br>Within the City Grenfell slipped easily into the hereditary world of the Bank of England, succeeding his father as a director in 1865 (part of an almost continuous tradition of family service between 1830 and 1940). He took his turn as deputy governor (1879&#150;81) and as governor (1881&#150;3), and remained a director until his death. He played an active part in defending the bank from its critics, and in urging (in vain) a consolidating banking act to tidy up the loose ends left by Peel's <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span> of 1844. His growing enthusiasm for monetary issues led to his joining the Political Economy Club in 1876 (he served as its treasurer from 1882 to 1900). Most importantly, he became after 1880, with his fellow bank director Henry Hucks Gibbs, an inexhaustible advocate of the bimetallic standard, which he defended in several pamphlets published in 1886, and various subsequent writings and articles, especially in <span class="italic">The Bimetallist</span>, 1895&#150;1901. Although influenced in this by French and American theorists, he claimed that his views arose from his practical experience as a bank director. Yet this crusade commanded little support within the bank despite Grenfell's (even while governor) forcefully propagating his views through the International Monetary Standard Association, and, in a more populist vein, the Bimetallic League. He gave evidence to the royal commission on precious metals in 1887, served as vice-president of the International Monetary Congress at Paris in 1889, and did much to keep the issue firmly in the public mind. This represented a significant attempt to formulate an economic policy to remedy falling prices during the &#145;great depression&#146;, while in several ways anticipating twentieth-century international monetary diplomacy and perceptions of a damaging conflict of interests between the &#145;City&#146; and &#145;industry&#146; in the British economy.<br>
<br>Outside the bank parlour, Grenfell took on the crop of directorships and responsibilities appropriate for &#145;one of the City's most eminent personages&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Nov 1887). He sat on the royal commission investigating the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1888&#150;9, and chaired, <i>inter alia</i>, the National Mortgage and Agency Co., New Zealand, the Royal Sardinian Railway, and the Buenos Aires Water Co. But in 1887 his association with the more dubious Harney Park Dacotah Tin Mining Co. led to his losing a suit for slander brought by the founder of the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>, Harry Marks. In 1892 the family firm itself was wound up, with Grenfell falling into comparative poverty by City standards (leaving some &pound;38,000 at death).<br>
<br>On 25 July 1867 Grenfell married Alethea Louisa (1829/30&#150;1923), daughter of Henry John Adeane, MP for Cambridgeshire from 1857 to 1865. Their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33560/', "Edward Charles Grenfell")</script> prospered with J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. (later Morgan Grenfell), and became Baron St Just. Grenfell himself died of pneumonia at his country home, Bacres, Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, on 11 September 1902.<br>
