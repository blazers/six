<span class="headword">Dove,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1641, <em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at Ilsington, Devon, on 2 November 1641, the son of Robert Dove (<i>d</i>. 1645) and his wife, Elizabeth. His father, rector of Ilsington and of Elm and Emneth in the fens, was sequestered from his East Anglian parishes for deserting his cure for the royal army, and proceedings were in train to deprive him from Ilsington when he died there in September 1645. Educated at Westminster School, where he was a boarder from 1656, Henry Dove was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1658. He graduated BA in 1661 and MA in 1665, was incorporated MA at Oxford on 6 May 1669, and proceeded DD in 1677. Ordained deacon at Ely in March 1665, he became vicar of St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, on 12 January 1673 and on 3 December 1678 was collated to the archdeaconry of Richmond. He was chaplain to his uncle John Pearson, bishop of Chester, who recommended him to the king for the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1683. He was also chaplain successively to Charles II, James II, and William and Mary.<br>
<br>Although Dove was married twice no record can be found of his first marriage, which produced a daughter, Susan. In 1680 he married his second wife, Rebecca Holworthy (<i>bap</i>. 1657), who was described in the marriage licence of 2 July as &#145;of St. Margaret, Westminster, spinster, aged 23&#146;  (Chester, 414).<br>
<br>Described as &#145;an able preacher&#146;  (<span class="italic">Old Westminster</span>, 1.279), Dove published several sermons. In 1680 he published <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Honourable House of Commons &hellip; Nov. 5, 1680</span> which commented on the furious political debate surrounding Titus Oates's Popish Plot revelations in 1678 and the subsequent parliamentary attempts to exclude Charles II's brother, James, from succeeding the throne. Thanking God for his &#145;deliverance of the King and Kingdom from the bloody designs of Popish Traytors&#146;, Dove nevertheless railed against &#145;all Sedition &hellip; Heresie and Schism&#146; and encouraged a &#145;hearty Loyalty and Fidelity to our King&#146;, thus declaring his support for Charles and all those who opposed the whig attempts to pass bills of exclusion.<br>
<br>Narcissus Luttrell refers to Dove preaching a sermon &#145;exhorting to unity and loyalty&#146;, which was later published as <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Right Honourable Lord Mayor &hellip; on the Feast of St. Michael, 1682</span>  (Luttrell, 1.225), while John Evelyn mentions Dove's <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the King at Whitehall, January 25, 1685</span>. Dove also published <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached before the Queen at Whitehall, February the Fifteenth, 1691</span> and <span class="italic">Albania: a Poem Humbly Offered</span>, in memory of Queen Mary in 1695. His relationship to the queen, rightful heir in the absence of James and the model of Anglican piety, suggests how Dove's loyalist churchmanship could accommodate itself to the revolution of 1688. A further pointer to his continuing religious sensibilities is provided by his presence among those who witnessed the will of Francis Atterbury.<br>
<br>Dove died on 11 March 1695, leaving his second wife and his daughter, Susan. His will detailed a gift of &pound;5 for the poor of his parish, 40 shillings for each of his servants and &pound;400 for his daughter, to be received on her twenty-first birthday or her marriage, if earlier. Susan also received copyhold lands in Sutton, Lincolnshire, left him by his first wife. His second wife, Rebecca, inherited the remainder of his goods and estate. He was buried in St Bride's Church.<br>
