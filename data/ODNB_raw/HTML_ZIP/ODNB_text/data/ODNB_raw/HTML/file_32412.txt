<span class="headword">Church, Sir  William Selby</span>, first baronet  (1837&#150;1928), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at Hatfield on 4 December 1837, the youngest of three sons of John Church (1782&#150;1872), of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and Belshill, Northumberland, and Isabella, daughter of George Selby of Beal, and Twizell House, Northumberland. Church was educated at Harrow School (1851&#150;6), where he played cricket for the first eleven, and at University College, Oxford. He graduated in 1860 with a first-class degree in natural sciences. He was then appointed Dr Lee's reader in anatomy and became a senior student at Christ Church. In 1862 he entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and he resigned his readership in 1869. He obtained the BM and DM degrees in 1864 and 1868 respectively, his dissertation for the latter dealing with hydatid cysts of the liver. He obtained membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1864 and was elected to the fellowship in 1870.<br>
<br>In 1866 Church was appointed assistant physician both to the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest and to the Royal General Dispensary; during the cholera epidemic that year he took charge of the cholera wards at St Bartholomew's Hospital. In 1867 he was elected assistant physician and lecturer on comparative anatomy; he was appointed full physician to St Bartholomew's in 1874 and held this post until 1902, when he became consulting physician (having retired under the age rule). Later, as treasurer of St Bartholomew's, Church rendered valuable services to the medical school. He apparently made no serious effort to obtain a private practice. When his father died, both Church's elder brothers had predeceased him and he inherited Woodside Place, Hatfield. He could thereafter have lived a country life (he had the tastes of a country squire), but preferred medicine. On 14 July 1875 Church married Sybil Constance (1845/6&#150;1913), daughter of Charles John Bigge of Linden, Northumberland; there were two sons (the elder of whom was killed in the First World War) and one daughter of the marriage.<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Physicians Church was successively examiner (between 1874 and 1886), councillor (1888&#150;9), censor (1890&#150;91), senior censor (1896), and in 1895 Harveian orator (on the rise of physiology in England); he was elected president in 1899 and held that office until 1905. In 1900 he became a member of the royal commission on the care and treatment of sick and wounded soldiers during the South African campaign; this involved a visit to, and extensive travel in, war areas. Church was created a baronet in 1901 and appointed KCB in 1902, in which year he served on the royal commission on arsenical poisoning in beer-drinkers in the midlands and north of England. He was subsequently appointed to a similar commission on vivisection (1906). He also became chairman of the executive committee of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (1902&#150;23) and of the distribution committees of the King Edward's Hospital Fund for London (1903&#150;18) and the Hospital Sunday Fund (until 1922). From 1889 until 1898 he represented Oxford on the General Medical Council. He was president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1893&#150;4. In 1907 he was chairman of the committee which recommended amalgamation of seventeen London medical societies to form the Royal Society of Medicine; he filled the office of president of this society in 1908&#150;10. Following retirement he continued to take an active interest in the affairs of his county as a JP and county councillor.<br>
<br>Church was not a prolific writer (though one of his obituary notices lists sixty-five publications), but contributed a number of articles on embolic aneurysms and, jointly with W. Bulloch, acute rheumatism; the latter work was based on 700 cases and is recorded in Sir Clifford Allbutt's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span>. Between 1877 and 1893 he was editor of <span class="italic">St Bartholomew's Hospital Reports</span>. Church was awarded several honorary degrees: DSc (Oxford; Victoria, Manchester), DCL (Durham), and LLD (Glasgow).<br>
<br>Church was described as tall and handsome, of few words, and incisive of mind and judgement. He could readily sum up a situation with a few terse phrases, and was totally honest and innately courteous. As a physician he was renowned for his diagnostic ability. Apart from his interest and ability at cricket, he played real tennis, rode a bicycle, and was a member of the London Skating Club (being since his student days an accomplished figure skater), and even in his eighties he continued to shoot. He was never present at St Bartholomew's on Derby day and during the Ascot week.<br>
<br>Church died at Woodside Place on 27 April 1928. The baronetcy passed to his younger son, Major Geoffrey Selby Church MC RFA (1887&#150;1979).<br>
