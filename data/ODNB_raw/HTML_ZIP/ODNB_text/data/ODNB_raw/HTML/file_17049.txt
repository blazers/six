<span class="headword">Loveday,  Samuel</span>  (1619?&#150;1677), <span class="occ">General Baptist preacher</span>, was the son of William Loveday, scissorer (tailor) of Helions Bumpstead, Essex. On 5 October 1638 he was bound apprentice in London to John Hanson, a member of the Company of Merchant Taylors. At an unknown date he married his wife, Jane; they brought up several children, of whom at least five survived him.<br>
<br>In 1642 Loveday published in defence of recent damage caused to Cheapside Cross (or Jasper), a &#145;monument of idolatry&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Old Charing Cross has lost its head<br>
</div>
<div>and so't may be your feare<br>
</div>
<div>that Jasper's noddle would be gone<br>
</div>
<div>but for the watchman's care<br>
</div>
<div>His case is bad, but to conclude<br>
</div>
<div>If Jasper for me send<br>
</div>
<div>when he assaulted is againe<br>
</div>
<div>No help to him I'll lend<br>
</div> (Loveday, <span class="italic">Cheap-side Crosse</span>, 4)</blockquote>Loveday was made free of the Company of Merchant Taylors on 12 November 1645. About this time, and until at least 1651, he seems to have been living and perhaps working with another Baptist merchant tailor, Edward Barber, in Threadneedle Street, London. In late 1645, it was reported, Barber, assisted by another unnamed, instituted the ceremony of the laying on of hands in his congregation, and in 1654 a church now led by Loveday was reported to be one of those which followed the custom of &#145;the supper&#146;, a church meal, usually preceding communion, which was accepted only by churches which baptized by the laying on of hands. All this may suggest that Loveday acted at first as Barber's assistant.<br>
<br>In November 1650 Loveday published his <span class="italic">Hatred of Esau</span> as a &#145;Servant of the Church of Christ&#146;, which suggests he was an elder or pastor. By that time, he had come to the view that saints might fall away, the first General Baptist known publicly to embrace that doctrine, and eagerly anticipated the imminent conversion of the Jews: &#145;none of us shall enter into glory until the Jews come up too; therefore let us use all means possible to publish that light, and put forth that power we have to bring them up&#146;  (Loveday, <span class="italic">Hatred of Esau</span>, 15).<br>
<br>In September 1654 there were plans to divide Loveday's congregation, apparently because of internal dissension, though the source of this is unknown. Loveday's name does not appear as an elder or messenger in the reports of the intercongregational assemblies of the General Baptists in 1654 and 1656. In October 1655, however, members of his congregation subscribed a petition in support of the Socinian John Biddle, though apparently not unanimously, and perhaps against the opposition of the pastor himself.<br>
<br>Reports of December 1657 indicate that there were close and continuing links between Loveday's congregation and the influential church of Fenstanton, Huntingdonshire, whose members sometimes lodged with Loveday's on visits to London. By this time the church was meeting at Tower Hill. In March 1660 Loveday and several followers subscribed <span class="italic">A Brief Confession &hellip; of Faith</span>, and in January 1661 they joined in the denunciations of Thomas Venner's uprising. Most of the Baptist churches were anxious to dissociate themselves from Venner, and were generally drawn towards quietism after the Restoration. The government was not always convinced by this. In 1670 Loveday's meeting-place, now at Looking Glass Alley in East Smithfield, was raided, and many of the congregation, who had come to hear a sermon by John Jennings, were arrested.<br>
<br>But Loveday himself had never been a very militant or populist leader in the style of Samuel Oates or Jeremiah Ives. Crosby tells us he was &#145;noted for his great moderation, and very seldom concerned himself with controverted points&#146;  (Crosby, 4.250). His interpretation of the twenty-fifth chapter of <span class="roman">Matthew</span> was expounded over &#145;the space of one year&#146; in &#145;that small congregation over which I am concerned by the providence and grace of God as a pastor or feeder&#146;  (Loveday, <span class="italic">Alarm</span>, &#145;Letter to the reader&#146;).<br>
<br>Loveday seems to have prospered in business: on 3 October 1673 he was admitted to the livery of the Company of Merchant Taylors, and at his death was able to leave two houses to his wife, Jane. There were bequests of &pound;50 to his two sons, John and Samuel, but &pound;150 to Elizabeth, evidently his favourite; Mary and Hester, on the other hand, got &#145;twenty shillings apiece&#146;, in satisfaction of &#145;all claims they may have or pretend to have on my estate&#146;  (PROB 11/355, sig. 128, fol. 262<i>r</i>). We may suspect their mode of life and belief, or their marriages, did not meet with his approval.<br>
<br>Loveday retained firm Baptist convictions until his death. <span class="italic">An elegy on the much lamented death of Mr. Samuel Loveday &hellip; on the 15th of December 1677 in the 59th year of his age</span> stresses the many years of his service to the congregation in east London&#151;&#145;bless the Lord that lent us him so long&#146;&#151;and warmly recalls his &#145;pious, rare and vertuous life&#146;.<br>
