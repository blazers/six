<span class="headword">Holcroft,  Francis</span>  (1628/9?&#150;1692), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was a younger son of Sir Henry Holcroft (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;1650), of Green Street, East Ham, Essex, and his wife, Lettice, daughter of Francis Aungier, first Baron Aungier of Longford in Ireland. He was admitted as a pensioner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 24 June 1647, and had as his &#145;chamber-fellow&#146; John Tillotson, later archbishop of Canterbury. Holcroft graduated BA in 1650, became a fellow in 1651, and proceeded MA in 1654. While at Cambridge he embraced puritan principles, and became a communicant with the congregation of Jonathan Jephcot, vicar of St Mary, Swaffham Prior, acting for a time as an unpaid minister at Littlington, Cambridgeshire. On 8 January 1656 he accepted the living of Bassingbourn, and also in that year joined the voluntary Cambridgeshire association of ministers. On 10 December 1657 he was appointed an assistant to commission for the ministry in the counties of Cambridge and Huntingdon.<br>
<br>In 1660 Holcroft was ejected from both his fellowship and his living. He stayed in London for a time and preached at Croydon with Thomas Taylor, the former pastor at Bury St Edmunds. In 1663 it was reported that he &#145;lyes at Widdow Hawkes att Barly in Harfordshire who hath meetings of 300 at a time &hellip; meets with many hundreds at Cambridge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 271). Holcroft formed a gathered church on congregational principles; the wide geographical spread of his people led, after a meeting at Eversden, to the recruitment as elders of Joseph Oddy and two others. A government agent reported that these rode &#145;by turns &hellip; into Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire to gather a concourse of people to their meetings&#146;  (Davids, 621).<br>
<br>In August 1663 Holcroft was imprisoned in Cambridge gaol for illegal preaching, and was said to have been sentenced &#145;either to take the oath of abjuration of the kingdom, never to return, or be hanged &hellip; if theyl transport him and sell him for a slave it will be worse than death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Heywood &hellip; Autobiography</span>, 3.83). In August 1664 he petitioned for a pardon, protesting that he had taken the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and asked to be able to travel overseas for a time. A reprieve was granted following the intervention of the earl of Anglesey, but travel plans were disrupted first by plague, and then by war with France, and he was still in prison in July 1666. In 1669 Holcroft was reported as preaching at the city of Cambridge, in Histon, Over, Stoke-cum-Quy, and Haddenham (all in Cambridgeshire), and also at Hugglescote, Leicestershire. The episcopal returns report meetings of about a hundred in four of these parishes. On 8 May he was licensed to teach as a congregationalist in Bridge Street, Cambridge, and he was released on 17 May, but the licence did not discourage the authorities from rearresting him on 6 April the following year. Renewed imprisonment resulted in insolvency and committal to the Fleet prison, where it was reported that he frequently preached to large crowds of people. He was helped through these difficulties, Edmund Calamy reports, by his old room-mate, John Tillotson.<br>
<br>Holcroft's troubles, however, continued. He appears to have moved to Chesterton, Cambridgeshire, for on 1 September 1676 he was presented for absence from church for a month as of that place. Also in that year he and Oddy debated at Triplow with the Quaker Samuel Cater. In a bad-tempered series of exchanges, Holcroft described Cater's view that every man is enlightened by Christ as &#145;cursed idolatry&#146; and Cater said Holcroft was &#145;in knowledge more brutish than a beast&#146;; the two congregationalists are said to have &#145;hastened away with railing words&#146;  (Whiting, 123). Holcroft is known to have preached in Hitchin on 24 May 1678. It is not known how long he actually spent in Cambridge gaol&#151;the few months following the indulgence are the only certain extended period of freedom during the years from 1662 to 1680. Whether his preaching activities in other periods stemmed from the sympathies of his gaoler or from official discharges is unclear. In his <span class="italic">A Word from the Watch Tower</span>, dated from Cambridge Castle, 27 December 1679, he states that he had been there for seven years. The work was directed to &#145;the faithful brethren in Christ in London&#146;; this reflected his connection with the congregational churches whose leaders were John Owen and John Griffith.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1680 at the quarter sessions, Holcroft &#145;late of Chesterton&#146; was imprisoned for having failed to appear in church for a month; recently &#145;in the mansion house of one Robert Stainsmore, in Chesterton aforesaid&#146; he had been &#145;voluntarily present at an unlawfull assembly&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Case of many Protestants in the County of Cambridge</span>). His efforts were regarded with suspicion on the respectable wing of dissent, and not only because of his opposition to communion with members of the established church. Edward Pearse wrote to Richard Baxter on 23 December 1687 complaining that at Holcroft's house &#145;Anabaptists have exercised there, and young raw fellows have exercised upon scripture their own conceits&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.293). Holcroft himself seems to have come to regret his own liberalism, for after 1689 he became prone to deep depression &#145;promoted by grief for the headiness of some of his people, who turned preachers, or encouraged such as did so&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.86); reference was later made to &#145;God's dark and severe dispensation towards him in his latter days&#146;  (Milway, 21). According to Thomas Milway's <span class="italic">A Funeral Sermon</span> (1692), Holcroft died at Triplow, Cambridgeshire, on 6 January 1692 aged sixty-three, and was buried in the dissenters' graveyard at Oakington, although his memorial there gives his age at death as fifty-nine.<br>
