<span class="headword">Marshall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smith]</span>,  Agnes Bertha</span>  (1855&#150;1905), <span class="occ">ice-cream maker</span>, was born on 24 August 1855 at Walthamstow, Essex, the daughter of John Smith, a clerk, and his wife, Susan. After her father's early death her mother remarried. Nothing is known about her early education or where she learned to cook, but it was later stated in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> that &#145;Mrs Marshall has made a thorough study of cookery since she was a child, and has practised at Paris and with Vienna's celebrated chefs&#146;  (Weir and others, 12). On 17 August 1878 she married Alfred William, son of Thomas Marshall, a builder.<br>
<br>Agnes Marshall became one of the foremost Victorian cookery writers, and was the best-known writer of the day on ice-cream. Her <span class="italic">Book of Ices</span> appeared in 1885, followed by <span class="italic">Mrs A. B. Marshall's Cookery Book</span> (1888). Her <span class="italic">Larger Cookery Book of Recipes</span> was published in 1891. A book entitled <span class="italic">Fancy Ices</span> appeared in 1894. Agnes Marshall and her husband also established the Marshall School of Cookery&#151;one of only two major London cookery schools&#151;at 31 Mortimer Street, London, in January 1883. From 1886 they began to produce <span class="italic">The Table</span>, a weekly newspaper devoted to &#145;Cookery, Gastronomy [and] food amusements&#146;, and for the first six months Agnes produced a new recipe for each issue.<br>
<br>Unlike Mrs Beeton, who edited a work that also contained readers' recipes, Mrs Marshall featured dishes which she herself devised. The introduction to her first book assured the reader that &#145;every recipe in it has been tried out by myself, and that I have written each accordingly, and have not copied from other authors&#146;. Her recipes were models of exact detail, simplicity, and accuracy; and, according to the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>, that for Cumberland rum butter was the earliest recorded.<br>
<br>Marshall's most lasting contributions were her two classic books on ice-cream: only one earlier book on the subject in English is known. Her innovations included the design of a fast ice-cream machine (patented by her husband). In 1888 she suggested putting ice-cream in an edible cornet or cone&#151;a practice previously thought to have originated in the USA. The use of liquefied gas in the making of ice-cream can also be credited to her. She helped popularize ice-creams and sorbets, at a time when they were still novel, enabled to do so by the importation of inexpensive ice from both Norway and the USA. An adept publicist, Agnes Marshall gave demonstrations all over the country to audiences of anything up to 500 people, and these helped promote not only her cookery school and publications, but also the business that she ran with her husband. This involved the manufacture and retail of cooking equipment, stocked by top department stores like Harrods. The firm also fitted out country house kitchens.<br>
<br>Mrs Marshall's reputation rapidly declined after her death. She never properly recovered after being thrown from a horse in 1904; and she died at The Towers, Pinner, on 29 July 1905. She was cremated at Golders Green crematorium, her ashes being interred at Paines Lane cemetery, Pinner. Her husband got married again within a year, to a secretary she had previously sacked. The rights to her books were sold to Ward Lock, the publishers of Mrs Beeton. The culinary equipment business declined and was also eventually sold.<br>
<br>Recent publications, however, have restored Agnes Marshall to her rightful place in the pantheon of Victorian cookery experts. Elizabeth David refers to the &#145;famous Mrs Marshall&#146; in her posthumously published <span class="italic">Harvest of the Cold Months: the Social History of Ice and Ices</span> (1994), and reproduces an illustration of &#145;A bomba a la Fedora&#146; from <span class="italic">Fancy Ices</span>. A recent biographical study has the title, <span class="italic">Mrs Marshall: the Greatest Victorian Ice Cream Maker</span> (1998).<br>
