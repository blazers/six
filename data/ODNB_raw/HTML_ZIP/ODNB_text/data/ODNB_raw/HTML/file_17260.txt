<span class="headword">Lynch, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was the son of Theophilus Lynch (<i>b</i>. 1603) and his wife, Judith, eldest daughter of John Aylmer, bishop of London. Nothing is known of Lynch's early life and education before he went out to Jamaica in the army of General Robert Venables in 1655. He had returned to England by 1660 when, as a captain, he petitioned the government for a passage back to Jamaica in one of the king's ships. While in England he secured for himself the lucrative appointment of provost marshal of Jamaica for life.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas Lynch was one of the most successful settlers in early Jamaica, serving as governor of the island between 1671 and 1674 and between 1682 and 1684. He distinguished himself as a strong advocate for the future development of the island and as a devoted representative of planter interests against the interests of buccaneers. Along with his great rival Sir Thomas Modyford, Lynch was a principal founding father of Jamaica in a crucial stage of its early development.<br>
<br>By 1664 Lynch possessed the most promising plantation in Port Morant. He worked this 1000 acre tract with a labour force of five white servants and thirty-seven slaves. By his departure for England in 1665 he had planted 45 acres, had erected a splendid sugar works, and built a well-furnished two-storey plantation house, suggesting an investment of at least &pound;3000. He had also established himself as a person of political importance. In December 1662 he was lieutenant-colonel of the militia; in April 1663 he was sworn in as a member of the council; and in April 1664 he became president of the council. He remained a councillor when Sir Thomas Modyford became governor in June 1664 but appears to have fallen out with Modyford by February 1665. He wrote to Lord Arlington on 12 February 1665 that Modyford had discharged him from the council without giving any public reason. This falling out may have encouraged him to leave for England in 1665 instead of staying in Jamaica, where he had intended to &#145;marry, send for his relations and make this his England&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 1/19/31).<br>
<br>In September 1670 Lynch was revenged on Modyford when he was appointed in Modyford's stead as lieutenant-governor of Jamaica. On 3 December he was knighted at Whitehall and on 16 January, probably in 1671 but possibly in 1670, he married Vere Herbert at Weybridge, Surrey. By June 1671 he had returned with his wife to a colony plunged into factional strife: buccaneers versus planters. Lynch was on the side of the planters, reminding Whitehall officials that &#145;if Jamaica have easy government, be defended from enemies, and supplied with negroes and servants, and have no privateering, in six years it may produce as much sugars as Barbadoes&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 7.477). He opened up the Jamaican frontier to settlement, issuing 1200 patents for planting, mostly in unsettled parishes. He maintained good relations with the island's assembly, raising the republican and civilian part of the colonial constitution towards equality with its authoritarian and military foundations. He fostered trade, encouraging Jewish merchants and other religious minorities to engage in clandestine trade, in which he himself also participated. He was less successful in rooting out buccaneering and in implementing the treaty of Madrid of 1670. He tried to establish open trade with Spanish America but the Spanish were not prepared to buy &#145;so much as an emerald&#146; from the British because they believed Lynch had breached the treaty by encouraging logwood cutting in Spanish territory and because they did not accept his boastful claims that he had eliminated privateering  (Zahedieh, &#145;The merchants of Port Royal&#146;, 575). Although privateering did diminish in the early 1670s, it did not disappear but stabilized at lower levels. Lynch's attempt to lure privateers into planting by promising them grants of 35 acres if they gave up their way of life was seldom taken up. His arrest and execution of Peter Johnson, a privateer with a string of murders to his account, led to popular unrest in Port Royal, where Johnson was mourned &#145;as if he had been as pious and innocent as one of the primitive martyrs&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 1/30/67&#150;8). More importantly, Lynch's contacts in England were less powerful than those of the buccaneers and, to Lynch's disgust, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19224/', "Sir Henry Morgan")</script>, &#145;Admirall of the Pryvateers&#146; sent back to England in disgrace in 1672, was appointed lieutenant-governor in March 1674 and returned to Jamaica in triumph in 1675. Meanwhile Lynch's commission was revoked in November 1674.<br>
<br>Lynch went back to England. A son, Charles, had been born to the Lynches in October 1671; a daughter, Philadelphia, was baptized on 4 June 1676 at St Martin-in-the-Fields and later married Sir Thomas Cotton, bt. It is unclear when Lynch married his second wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Temple of Warwickshire, who subsequently married Colonel Hender Molesworth, governor of Jamaica, 1684&#150;7. They had no children. Lynch was reappointed governor of Jamaica in August 1681. Although he considered that &#145;Arguing with Assemblys is like philosophising with a Mule&#146;, he secured a twenty-one-year revenue act that guaranteed regular fiscal income to the royal government  (Dunn, 159). His second governorship, following his arrival in May 1682, was marked by conflicts with Sir Henry Morgan's pro-buccaneering faction, but buccaneering was declining as planting began to prosper, much to Lynch's satisfaction. In 1682 he claimed that planting and trade were flourishing so much &#145;that within 15 months every man's freehold &hellip; is almost risen in value from 50 to 200 percent&#146;  (Claypole, 173). Highlights of his governorship included the publication of the first compilation of Jamaican laws and the first detailed map of settlement in the island. He died on 24 August 1684 and was buried in the cathedral at St Jago de la Vega. At his death he was the principal planter in Jamaica, owning 21,438 acres and a mansion of thirteen rooms. He left a lavish inventory, which included furnishings of &pound;1236, silver worth &pound;361, a coach, chariot and thirteen horses, and 100 books, as well as slaves and sugar-making utensils. His nephew Peter Beckford, whom Lynch appointed as captain of forts, succeeded him as the leading and wealthiest planter in Jamaica.<br>
