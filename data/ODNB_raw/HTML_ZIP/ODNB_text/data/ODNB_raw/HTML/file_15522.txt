<span class="headword">Kilburn,  William</span>  (1745&#150;1818), <span class="occ">artist and calico printer</span>, was born on 1 November 1745, at Capel Street, Dublin, the only son of Samuel Kilburn, architect of that city. He showed an early talent for drawing, and was apprenticed to John Lisson, an English calico printer with a large works at Leixlip, near Dublin. The family was in financial difficulties at the father's death, and in 1777 Kilburn moved to London, where he obtained a ready sale for his calico designs. He also became acquainted with William Curtis the botanist, and executed the exquisite plates of flowers, drawn and engraved from nature, for Curtis's celebrated <span class="italic">Flora Londinensis</span> (1777), during which time he lived with his mother and sister in Bermondsey.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards, in 1779, Kilburn accepted the management of a calico-printing factory at Wallington, Surrey, that had been expanded to a leading position by Ansell, Burton, and Bull in the early 1770s, but which was now owned by Newton of nearby Merton Abbey Works. After seven years he was able to purchase Newton's share of the enterprise, and ran it profitably for the rest of his life, though in later years he was threatened with the piracy of his designs by Lancashire printers.<br>
<br>According to an enthusiastic memoir in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, after the acquisition Kilburn rose rapidly in wealth, and was soon the most eminent calico printer in England, having &#145;brought the art to a pitch of perfection never since equalled&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 223). One of his employees, C. O'Brien, wrote the earliest British text on calico printing, and more than a hundred of Kilburn's chintz designs survive to demonstrate the excellence of his floral prints, but in this &#145;golden age&#146; of English calico printing the claim that his work was unequalled must be recognized as plausible rather than proven. Kilburn's marriage to the eldest daughter of Thomas Brown, a director of the East India Company, gives substance to the claim of economic success, while his leadership of the parliamentary campaign (1787) to secure copyright of design to calico printers confirms his eminence in this lucrative fashion trade. Most probably Kilburn was a unique instance in the London textile trade of the eighteenth century of an artist and designer becoming a successful entrepreneur.<br>
<br>Kilburn never returned to Ireland, though any Irishman who visited him was assured of a hospitable reception. He was known as a generous employer and a man of the highest moral and Christian principles. He was over 6 feet tall, upright and slender in build. Kilburn enjoyed excellent health until a few months before his death when, feeling indisposed, he went to Brighton, but, failing to improve, returned to Wallington, where he died on 23 December 1818.<br>
