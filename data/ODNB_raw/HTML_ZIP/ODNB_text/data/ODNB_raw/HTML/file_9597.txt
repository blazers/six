<span class="headword">Robert fitz Harding</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1171), <span class="occ">burgess and merchant</span>, was the grandson, through his father, Harding, of the Saxon thegn Eadnoth the Staller, who died near Bristol in 1068 leading resistance against an invasion by Harold Godwineson's sons. Robert's father appears in the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> survey as a Somerset landlord in possession of thegnland and may have had a house on Baldwin Street in Bristol. In the twelfth century some of this land was held by Robert's elder brother Nicholas of the earldom of Gloucester. The persistent claim that Robert served as the borough's reeve is without foundation. Local tradition aptly described him as a Bristol burgess and merchant. His great stone house stood on High Street near Frome Bridge. He engaged in the Bristol land market and was landlord of properties in at least four other urban locations. He also may have been involved in Bristol's trade with Dublin.<br>
<br>As a financier Robert numbered among his clients Henry FitzEmpress (during the civil war against King Stephen) and St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. However, the scope of his land dealings went far beyond the limits of Bristol. Suburban tenures which he held across the River Frome in Billeswick may have been existing appurtenances of some of his burghal holdings. He acquired additional suburban property south of the River Avon in Bedminster from Bristol's lord, Robert, earl of Gloucester, before 1147. Further estate building involved acquiring, sometimes by purchase, far-flung lands and knights' fees from royal tenants-in-chief such as the earls of Gloucester, Chester, and Warwick. Robert's role as a proprietary land developer is evident in the charter of liberties he granted to settlers in the borough he established in Bedminster. In keeping with the trend in monastic piety and the stature he had achieved in Bristol by the early 1140s, he founded during that decade St Augustine's Abbey on his Billeswick property.<br>
<br>Further social and tenurial enhancement came from patronage Robert received from Henry FitzEmpress both before and after Henry became king, almost certainly as a reward for Robert's financial backing during the war against King Stephen (1135&#150;54). In the early 1150s Robert appears as a burgage tenant in Bristol, the earldom of Gloucester's most valuable demesne manor, almost certainly holding of the earl, and also holding of three of the honorial barons whose fees included parts of the borough. He had also begun to expand his holdings to the suburbs and beyond, a process which made him a tenurial knight by 1166 if not before. Before the death of Robert, earl of Gloucester, in 1147 Robert's prominence must have led the earl to include him as an honorial <i>familiaris</i> (follower or companion) at his courts held at Bristol, a role he continued to enjoy under Earl Robert's heir, William (<i>d</i>. 1183). Then came a series of ducal and royal grants from Henry FitzEmpress, datable to 1153/4 and 1154/5, and a marriage treaty Henry sanctioned, which are recorded in a remarkable series of original charters preserved in the Berkeley Castle muniments. Henry first granted Bitton and land worth &pound;100 at Berkeley, with the right to fortify a castle, for the service of two mewed hawks; a second ducal grant added Berkeley Hernesse with important proprietary rights for the service of one knight or 100<i>s</i>., in return for a payment of 500 marks; and finally Henry as king adjusted the service quota of his tenant-in-chief to five knights.<br>
<br>Several of Henry's grants were made to Robert's presumptive heir, Maurice. As a complement to these grants, in 1153 Henry sanctioned, if not arranged, a marriage between Maurice and Alice, the daughter of the dispossessed Gloucestershire tenant-in-chief and lord of Berkeley, Roger. The agreement between Robert and Roger, which was formalized in Robert's Bristol house in Henry's presence, also provided for the transfer of additional Berkeley land to Maurice. Its terms created through Maurice, Alice, and their heirs the second house of Berkeley with relentless determination: should Robert's son or Roger's daughter die before the nuptials, their places would be taken by their respective brothers and sisters so long as the supply would last. Another interesting aspect of these ducal and royal charters and the marriage treaty is that they may very well have been written by scribes provided by Robert. The treaty and at least four charters appear to be the work of two monastic scribes from Robert's foundation, St Augustine's.<br>
<br>In spite of Henry II's early favour, Robert never became one of his intimates. His importance remained local and regional. But in this capacity he twice provided hospitality at Bristol for the king of Leinster, Diarmait mac Murchada, during his mission of 1166&#150;7 to enlist Anglo-Normans, notably Richard de Clare, to campaign for him in Ireland; and it is possible that Robert played some role in bringing together Clare and the Irish king.<br>
<br>Robert and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54454/', "Eva (d. c.1173)")</script>, had five sons and three daughters. He retired from public life some time after 1166&#150;8 to St Augustine's, where he died a canon on 5 February 1171. Bristol tradition held that shortly afterwards, about 1173, Eva founded on St Michael's Hill near St Augustine's a nunnery, St Mary Magdalene's, which she ruled as prioress; however, in the early thirteenth century the house was a hospital with a mixed community. Robert and his wife were buried in St Augustine's.<br>
