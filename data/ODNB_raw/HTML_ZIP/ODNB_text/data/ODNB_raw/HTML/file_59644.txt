<span class="headword">Annesley, Lady  Mabel Marguerite</span>  (1881&#150;1959), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and watercolour painter</span>, was born on 25 February 1881, at Annesley Lodge, Regent's Park, London, the daughter of Hugh Annesley, fifth Earl Annesley (1831&#150;1908), lieutenant-colonel in the Scots Fusilier Guards and landowner, and his wife, Mabel Wilhelmina Frances Markham, Countess Annesley (1858&#150;1891), granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11257/', "Sir Francis Grant")</script>, eminent Victorian portrait painter and president of the Royal Academy. Educated at home, in 1895 she studied at the Frank Calderon school of animal painting in London. In 1899 she was elected a member of the Belfast Art Society where she exhibited until 1926. On 14 January 1904 she married Gerald Sowerby (1878&#150;1913), flag lieutenant to Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg and flag commander to the commander-in-chief, Portsmouth. They had one son, Gerald Francis Annesley (1904&#150;1992). On the death of her father and brother she inherited Castlewellan Castle, where she returned to live in 1914 when her husband died, having resumed her maiden name. In her unfinished autobiography, <span class="italic">As the Sight is Bent</span> (published posthumously in 1964), Annesley described her six-year struggle to manage the estate as &#145;a real achievement&#146;  (Annesley, 26).<br>
<br>Annesley was about forty when she learnt to wood-engrave from Noel Rooke (1881&#150;1953) at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, where she studied from 1920 to 1921. Between 1922 and 1939 she exhibited twenty-seven prints with the Society of Wood Engravers to which she was elected a member in 1925. In the same year she exhibited at her studio at 12 Lombard Street, Belfast, where she also lectured on wood-engraving. Campbell Dodgson drew attention to her work in his seminal <span class="italic">Contemporary English Woodcuts</span> (1922). She produced wood-engraved illustration for the Golden Cockerel Press, including <span class="italic">Songs from Robert Burns</span> (1925), and for Duckworths <span class="italic">County Down Songs</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Apollo in Mourne</span> (1926) by the Ulsterman Richard Rowley. Despite developing arthritis in her hand Annesley continued to engrave, turning from boxwood to softer lino in her later years. In Dublin she exhibited with the Watercolour Society of Ireland (1926) and with the Dublin Painters (1938), and her work was included in an exhibition of Irish art held in Brussels in 1930. Costumes for the 1500th anniversary of the landing of St Patrick at Saul, co. Down, were designed by William Conor and Mabel Annesley for a pageant written by Richard Rowley held at Castle Ward, Strangford, in 1932. An exhibition of her watercolours, wood-engravings, and silverpoints was held in the Batsford Gallery, London (<i>c</i>.1933). She exhibited in the Ulster Unit exhibition (1934) and was appointed an honorary member of the Royal Ulster Academy. In 1939 she presented the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery with her fine collection of contemporary wood-engravings together with twenty of her own works. She lived for a time in Connemara and in Rathfriland, co. Down. When bombed out of her Belfast residence in 1942, she emigrated to New Zealand where she lived in Nelson and Takaka. For a number of years she was a trustee of the Bishop Suter Art Gallery, Nelson, and purchased work for the board while visiting England. She exhibited in the Festival of Britain in 1952 and the following year returned to England where she retired to Long Melford, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Much of Annesley's work is redolent of the countryside she loved, particularly the Mourne Mountains of co. Down. She was always interested in the shapes and patterns of the landscape; her expressive two-dimensional style owes much to Paul Nash whose work, as well as that of Frances Hodgkins and David Jones, she admired in her autobiography. She initialled her work &#145;M. A.&#146;. A superb horsewoman and exemplary landowner she had:<blockquote>an incorruptible sense of duty and tradition, most strikingly combined with a passionate grasp of all that was most vital in the world of modern art &hellip; The fundamental inspiration of her inner life sprang from an intense and profound feeling for beauty in nature and in art. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 June 1959)</blockquote>Throughout her life Annesley was hampered with ill health and family troubles which she overcame with characteristic courage. She died of myelomatosis on 19 June 1959 in Clare, Suffolk. She was buried in Long Melford, Suffolk. A joint memorial exhibition with Robert Gibbings and Gwen Raverat was held at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, in 1960, and a touring exhibition commemorating the centenary of her birth was organized by the Bishop Suter Art Gallery in 1981. Annesley's work is represented in the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Central St Martin's College of Art and Design, London; the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester; the Ulster Museum, Belfast; the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; and the National Gallery of New Zealand, Wellington, and Sargeant Gallery, Wanganui, New Zealand.<br>
