<span class="headword">Vivian,  John Henry</span>  (1785&#150;1855), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 9 August 1785 in Truro, the second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48392/', "John Vivian (1750&#150;1826)")</script>, mining and copper-smelting entrepreneur, and his wife, Betsy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cranch (<i>d</i>. 1816). He was educated at Truro grammar school and Lostwithiel School, and at the age of sixteen went to Germany to study languages. In 1803 he became a student at the Mining Institute of the University of Freiberg as a pupil of the geologist Abraham Werner. In 1806, at the age of twenty-one, he was appointed manager of the Pen-clawdd copper-smelting works of the Cheadle Brass and Wire Company in south Wales, in which his father was a partner. In 1809 he became a partner of Vivian &amp; Sons, together with his father and brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28341/', "Richard Hussey Vivian")</script>, and was appointed manager of its Hafod works in Swansea.<br>
<br>In 1816 Vivian married Sarah Jones (1799&#150;1886), daughter of Arthur Jones of The Priory, Reigate, Surrey. They had nine children, who were brought up in the family home, Marino, near Swansea, which was greatly extended and remodelled in a Gothic style and later renamed Singleton Abbey.<br>
<br>While Richard Hussey Vivian pursued a military career, and as his father became less involved in the direct running of the firm, John Henry Vivian devoted himself to the development of the family business. He was involved in a secret cartel of copper smelters, which operated in the 1820s to control the price of copper. He applied his technical knowledge of smelting to improve production methods and was largely responsible for the growth of Vivian &amp; Sons into one of the major firms in the industry, developing Hafod into a works town known as &#145;Vivian's Town&#146; or &#145;Trevivian&#146;. In 1835 the firm diversified into zinc smelting and shipping; in 1838 the firm acquired the Margam copper works from the English Copper Company; and in 1839 Vivian founded the Swansea Coal Company, both to supply his smelting works and to trade independently. In 1842 Vivian &amp; Sons began to manufacture &#145;Yellow Metal&#146;, an alloy of copper and zinc. Following the death of Richard Hussey Vivian the same year, Vivian bought out his late brother's estate to retain family control of the firm.<br>
<br>Vivian took particular interest in the atmospheric pollution or &#145;copper smoke&#146; problems associated with copper smelting, and during the 1820s employed Michael Faraday and Richard Phillips to develop a means of reducing the emission of pollutants. The firm was also involved in several court cases concerning pollution from smelting works.<br>
<br>Vivian had strong interests in science and education. In 1818 he established a select reading society in Swansea with his friend the industrialist Lewis Weston Dillwyn, and in 1835 they were founder members of the Philosophical and Literary Society, which later became the Royal Institution of South Wales. Vivian was the institution's first vice-president. His published account of the &#145;Welsh process&#146; of copper smelting and his scientific interest in copper production led to his being elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1823. He was also an early member of the Geological Society and a founder member of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1846. Vivian enjoyed travelling and in 1815 met the exiled Napoleon Bonaparte on Elba while dressed in the uniform of the Cornish militia, in which he served. An account of their conversation was later published.<br>
<br>Though apparently shy and a poor public speaker, Vivian was involved in public affairs. He became deputy lieutenant for Glamorgan in 1820, high sheriff in 1827, and as a whig was elected MP for Swansea in 1832. Described as an assiduous worker on committees, he remained in parliament until his death. Through his political involvement, he was instrumental in establishing in Cornwall in 1830 the newspaper the <span class="italic">West Briton</span> to counter the tory <span class="italic">Royal Cornwall Gazette</span>. He served as a justice of the peace, and, as a trustee of Swansea Harbour Board, he was involved in the major development of the town's port facilities. Vivian contributed to many charitable causes in the Swansea district and, with his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28339/', "Henry Hussey Vivian")</script>, established an Anglican church and school house in Sketty.<br>
<br>Vivian died at Singleton Abbey, Swansea, on 10 February 1855 and was survived by his wife.<br>
