<span class="headword">Barrett,  Rachel</span>  (1874&#150;1953), <span class="occ">suffragette and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 12 November 1874 at 23 Union Street, Carmarthen, the daughter of Welsh-speaking parents, Rees Barrett, land and road surveyor, and Anne Barrett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. Educated at a private school in Stroud, she later won a scholarship to Aberystwyth College, gaining a BSc (London) in 1904, and taught in schools at Penarth and Carmarthen.<br>
<br>In 1906 Rachel Barrett joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the women's suffrage organization founded by Emmeline Pankhurst, and helped Adela Pankhurst, the WSPU organizer in Cardiff. She spoke at many meetings on behalf of the cause and incurred the disapproval of her headmistress, especially, she said, when &#145;her science mistress was reported in the local papers as drenched with flour at an open air meeting at the Cardiff docks&#146;  (Barrett, 126&#150;7). In July 1907 she resigned her teaching post and enrolled at the London School of Economics (LSE), intending to study for a DSc in economics. In 1908, however, Christabel Pankhurst asked her to become a full-time organizer for the WSPU. This meant giving up her studies at the LSE, but, &#145;it was a definite call&#146;, she said, &#145;and I obeyed&#146;  (ibid., 127). In 1910 she was appointed WSPU organizer for Wales and moved to Newport, Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>Rachel Barrett was recalled to London in the spring of 1912, following Christabel Pankhurst's flight to Paris, to help Annie Kenney run the national campaign. Later that year she was asked to become assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, the new weekly newspaper of the WSPU. Annie Kenney said that she had chosen Rachel for this task because she was &#145;an exceptionally clever and highly educated woman, she was a devoted worker and had tremendous admiration for Christabel&#146;  (Kenney, 179). Rachel Barrett's reaction to being asked to edit the paper was that it was &#145;an appalling task as I knew nothing whatever of journalism&#146;  (Barrett, 129), but she took it on and with it the risks which the increasingly militant tactics of the WSPU involved. When she went to Paris to consult with Christabel, she had to travel under cover, and whenever they talked on the telephone, she &#145;could always hear the click of Scotland Yard listening in&#146;  (ibid., 129). In April 1913 the WSPU offices were raided and the staff of the paper arrested on charges of conspiring to damage property. Rachel Barrett was sentenced to a month's imprisonment. She immediately went on hunger strike and was released five days later under the terms of the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span>. She was subsequently re-arrested and released twice more and while out on licence for the third time had herself smuggled into WSPU offices in Kingsway House where she carried on bringing out <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>. She lived there in secret for five months, but while she was away in May 1914, the offices were raided once again. In consultation with Christabel, it was decided that she should go to Scotland, where newspaper law was different from England, in order to publish the paper from there. She lived in Edinburgh under an assumed name, calling herself Miss Ashworth, and brought out the paper each week until the last number appeared on the Friday after the First World War was declared.<br>
<br>Rachel Barrett never married. While working at <span class="italic">The Suffragette</span> she met Ida Alexa Ross Wylie (1885&#150;1959) the Australian novelist, who was a contributor to the paper, and they are thought to have become lovers  (Cline, 173). The couple figure in the 1920s as close friends of Radclyffe Hall and supporters over the trial of <span class="italic">The Well of Loneliness</span> in 1928. She died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 26 August 1953, at the age of seventy-eight at the Carylls Nursing Home in Faygate, Rusper, Sussex. Her death certificate describes her as a spinster and a teacher resident in Essex.<br>
