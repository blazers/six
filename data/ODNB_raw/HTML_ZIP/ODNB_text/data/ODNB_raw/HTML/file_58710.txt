<span class="headword">Westcott,  George Herbert</span>  (1862&#150;1928), <span class="occ">bishop of Lucknow</span>, was born in Harrow on the Hill on 18 April 1862, the fourth son in the family of seven sons and three daughters of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36839/', "Revd Brooke Foss Westcott (1825&#150;1901)")</script> and his wife, Sarah Louisa Mary Whithard (1830&#150;1901), elder daughter of Thomas Whithard. His father was then a master at Harrow School, but later became bishop of Durham. Westcott enjoyed a dependent relationship with his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58709/', "Foss Westcott")</script>, ultimately bishop of Calcutta and metropolitan of India, Burma, and Ceylon. Two other brothers also joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) in India, a field of prime importance to their father. Famous for promoting &#145;co-operative&#146; industrial relations, particularly in the Durham coalfields, B. F. Westcott's understanding of Christ's incarnation and the social mission of an imperial church profoundly influenced them all.<br>
<br>George went to Marlborough College from 1875 to 1881, returning as assistant master from 1886 to 1889. The norm of an athletic &#145;Christian&#146; manliness had been established there by successive disciples of Arnold of Rugby. He engaged with this as a boy, but without the distinction achieved by Foss at Cheltenham and Cambridge, where they were contemporaries at Peterhouse. A scholar of the college, he took a second class in the classical tripos in 1885. He was ordained by the bishop of Salisbury in 1887.<br>
<br>In 1889 both men were posted by the SPG to Cawnpore, India. The brotherhood was small, seldom up to strength, financially straitened, and committed already to the expatriate community, to the care of Christian famine orphans and an agricultural settlement, and to teaching in the high school, which Westcott rebuilt in 1892. The brothers started a printing press and industrial workshops, notably a brass foundry, to train orphans, recruiting European instructors, and raising money from grants and deputation work on brief furloughs. By 1916 press and workshops had served their turn and were closed; local factories took on all their employees forthwith, in preference to others and often at improved rates. Christ Church College with its hostels developed from the high school in 1897, and George served on the syndicate of the University of Allahabad to which it was affiliated.<br>
<br>Their fraternal partnership was dissolved reluctantly. Westcott refused the see of Rangoon in 1903, and in 1905 Foss Westcott hesitated before accepting Chota Nagpur, partly on the grounds that his brother &#145;was far better qualified for Episcopal work than myself&#146;  (F. Westcott to Bishop H. H. Montgomery, 23 March 1905, USPG archive). This was probably an accurate assessment at the time as regards the standard burden of diocesan administration, but Westcott was developing less routine inter-faith ambitions. Dr A. Clifford, whom he succeeded as bishop of Lucknow in 1910, informed SPG headquarters in 1909 that &#145;George Westcott without Foss is not quite the same person&#146; commenting on the mission's loss of &#145;tone &hellip; smoothness and &hellip; vigour&#146;  (A. Clifford to H. H. Montgomery, 15 July 1909, USPG archive); but he overlooked this significant supplementary distraction.<br>
<br>The brothers' commitment to &#145;Indianization&#146; and unification of Christian denominations entailed careful defocusing of doctrinal differences, in Foss Westcott's question-begging words on the grounds that &#145;irregular&#146; sacraments and practices are not invalid but potentially fruitful, where manifestly &#145;given by God in answer to the sincere faith of the recipients&#146;  (F. Westcott to G. H. Westcott, 12 Dec 1917, USPG archive). George Westcott, alarmed by the establishment of religious centres in north India by Muslims, Hindus, and Arya Samaj, sought to apply this simple &#145;fulfilment theology&#146; in an inter-faith context. From 1908 he eagerly promoted the establishment of a college of study, with accommodation for both Christians and non-Christians, to explore, in constructive, well-grounded confrontation, the gradual fulfilment in Christianity of fundamentally valid non-Christian insights.<br>
<br>He was defeated by &#145;chronic hardupness&#146; (to quote a sympathetic London Missionary Society missionary), by the war and, he believed, by SPG neglect, but wrote his book, <span class="italic">Kabir and the Kabir Panth</span> (1907; reprinted 1953). Kabir (<i>fl</i>. 1480), had drawn on Sufi and Hindu insights, but particularly from the personal devotionalism of the popular and unorthodox <i>bhakti</i> saints and poets, to excoriate exclusivism, ritualism, and caste hierarchy, and to teach a life of Christlike integrity. Characteristically, the principal acknowledgement in Westcott's modest scholarly work was to his own gardener, a <i>mali</i> of low caste and a <i>panthi</i> or devotee, who had furthered Westcott's enquiries &#145;with great intelligence&#146; and introduced him to many <i>mahants</i> or exponents in Kabir's contemporary following.<br>
<br>As bishop, Westcott cherished the garden he fostered at Allahabad, and against the climatic odds he was notably successful with his roses. Before he could retire to the Nilgiri hills in south India, within reach of his brother, Westcott died, unmarried, at his home, the bishop's house, Allahabad, on 16 January 1928. He was buried in Allahabad.<br>
