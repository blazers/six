<span class="headword">Greene,  Sidney Francis</span>, Baron Greene of Harrow Weald  (1910&#150;2004), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born at 45 Warlock Road, Paddington, London, on 12 February 1910, the son of Frank James Greene, whose main, though not only, occupation was to drive a horse-drawn van, and his wife, Alice Susannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kerrod. Unemployment struck intermittently. Greene would frequently refer to the fact that one of his pervading memories from boyhood was of his father going out early in the morning, saying that he hoped to get a job for the day. It was perhaps this memory that led Greene to be dismissive, sometimes contemptuous, of those who proposed to lead workers out on strike, at the drop of a proverbial hat, for no very good reason.<br>
<br>In 1924 Greene left elementary school to become a messenger in the Great Western Railway goods yard at Paddington. Educating himself at evening classes, he became a Labour borough councillor for seven years in Paddington, but the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), not the party, was the centre of his activity. On Boxing day 1936 he married Masel Elizabeth Carter (<i>d</i>. 1993), the 24-year-old daughter of Benjamin John Carter, taxi driver; they had three daughters. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Greene wanted to go into the forces, but work in the London marshalling yards was a reserved occupation, and he was forbidden to do so. Appointed a junior union organizer in 1944, he proved himself so effective in the volatile London region of the union that in 1954 he was appointed assistant general secretary.<br>
<br>When news reached the NUR's headquarters of the death in a car accident on an official trade union visit to Russia of James (Big Jim) Campbell, the union's ebullient general secretary, few thought that Greene would get the job, as he was considered a &#145;back-room&#146; boy rather than general secretary material. However, as often happens, prominent heavyweight contenders cancelled each other out, amid bickering, and Greene was chosen as a compromise candidate to lead more than 500,000 workers. As general secretary of the largest rail trade union Greene was a pivotal figure, not only in the affairs of British Rail, but more widely in Britain's economic life from 1957 until 1974. He was a member of the TUC's general council from 1957 to 1975 (and its chairman in 1969&#150;70), and chairman of its economic committee from 1968 to 1975. Among other appointments, he was a part-time member of the Southern Electricity Board (1964&#150;77) and the National Freight Corporation (1973&#150;7), and a director of the Bank of England (1970&#150;78).<br>
<br>Greene's most difficult period was in the early 1960s. Harold Macmillan's government had appointed Richard Beeching, a member of the main board of ICI, to be chairman of British Railways, with a brief to implement sweeping economies. In March 1963 Beeching, who, unlike Greene, believed that the railways should be run like a business and not as a public service, produced a report, <span class="italic">The Reshaping of British Railways</span>, which proposed a massive closure programme, involving a third of Britain's 18,000 miles of track, with the consequent loss of stations and the jobs of those manning them. Greene had to hold his members back from purely destructive reactions, and at the same time negotiate the best possible terms for those who were displaced. In the event the programme was carried out with comparatively little industrial trouble. This was undoubtedly due to a great extent to Greene's restraining influence, his civilized relations with Conservative ministers, and his skill in negotiating with the British Railways board. His approach did not endear him to Frank Cousins and Jack Jones of the Transport and General Workers' Union and Hugh Scanlon of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. The most dramatic single episode of his career came in a dispute over pay in 1972, when members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, and the NUR were the first and last to be subjected to a compulsory ballot, under the <span class="roman">Industrial Relations Act</span>, to see if they supported their leaders in the imposition of what was then known as &#145;working to rule&#146;. Greene insisted on observing the law, however repugnant he might privately have thought the law to be.<br>
<br>Greene was knighted in 1970, and on his retirement in 1974 he was made a life peer, as Baron Greene of Harrow Weald. His maiden speech of 25 February 1975 on the incoming Labour government's <span class="roman">Trade Union and Labour Relations Amendment Bill</span> encapsulated his view: &#145;I feel that there is too much heat in industrial relations. Basically it is something that should operate between men and women of good will, seeking to get agreement between one side and another&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 357.707). He was much in demand for committee work and directorships. From 1975 until 1980 he was a director of Rio Tinto Zinc and of Times Newspapers. After Rupert Murdoch's takeover of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> in 1980 he became for two years one of six independent national directors of Times Newspapers Holdings. Though no great orator, he was an exceedingly effective if usually reticent committee man. He hardly ever made a contribution that was less than pertinent to the issue under discussion, or that he did not mean.<br>
<br>Slightly built, neat of dress, pale of face, and unassuming in manner, with a cockney intonation in his speech, Greene was often underrated. In reality he served his members, and his country, well. He lived in retirement at Kynaston Wood, Harrow Weald, and died on 26 July 2004 at Westminster House nursing home, Wilsmere Drive, Harrow Weald, of cancer of the prostate. He was survived by his three daughters.<br>
