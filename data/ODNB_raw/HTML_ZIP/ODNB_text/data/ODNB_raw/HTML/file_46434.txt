<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stuart,  James Gray</span>, first Viscount Stuart of Findhorn  (1897&#150;1971), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at 2 Belford Park, Edinburgh, on 9 February 1897, the third son and third of the four children of Morton Gray Stuart, seventeenth earl of Moray (1855&#150;1930), and his wife, Edith Douglas Palmer (<i>c</i>.1869&#150;1945). He was educated at Eton College and intended for Cambridge but went from school to war in 1914. He was soldiering in France with the 1st battalion Royal Scots when only eighteen, after being commissioned into the 3rd battalion, and was invalided home in 1915. He returned to the front with the 2nd battalion in 1916 and by 1918 was brigade major (15th infantry brigade) with the Military Cross and bar. He was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>On demobilization Stuart spent a year studying law in Edinburgh for the Scottish bar but found this uncongenial. From 1920 to 1921 he was first equerry in waiting to Prince Albert, later George VI, and introduced the prince to his future queen, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. She came from the same Scottish aristocratic background as Stuart and had previously seemed, though not necessarily to her, a possible bride for him.<br>
<br>Stuart himself found a wife in the court circle&#151;Lady Rachel Cavendish (1902&#150;1977), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32332/', "Victor Christian William Cavendish, ninth duke of Devonshire")</script>. Stuart met her shortly after her return from Canada, where her father had been governor-general and her sister, Lady Dorothy, had settled on matrimony with Harold Macmillan, aide-de-camp and future prime minister. The Stuarts, who married on 4 August 1923, had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Stuart, made MVO for service as equerry, tentatively ventured into oil, learning the industry's ways in Oklahoma during 1922&#150;3, but on returning to Scotland was invited to be parliamentary Conservative candidate for Moray and Nairn. It was no family seat, not even usually Unionist but Liberal, latterly held by a Lloyd Georgian with Conservative votes. His father, however, urged or instructed him to &#145;have a shot&#146;  (Stuart, 2). Stuart, whose turn of phrase was often more expressive and pungent than epigrammatic, despite the elegance and wit of his autobiography, reputedly reacted to winning the seat at the general election of 1923 by saying: &#145;This is bloody ridiculous&#146;. But he held the seat for thirty-six years until 1959.<br>
<br>Stuart's apprenticeship in parliament was undistinguished. It was twelve years, during which he also worked in stockbroking, before he became Scottish whip, although slowness of promotion was partly due to claims on office of the Conservatives' National Government allies. As whip, Stuart developed gifts for persuasion, polite intimidation, cajoling, and listening, and in 1937 became deputy chief Conservative whip. He also began, amid some turbulence, his dealings with Winston Churchill, who had by then moved from party rebellion on India towards opposition to appeasement.<br>
<br>Stuart became Conservative chief whip at the beginning of 1941 (and joint chief government whip in the coalition, working alongside the chief Labour whip), his predecessor David Margesson having been posted by Churchill to the War Office in December 1940. Although he had enemies, notably Lord Beaverbrook, and Churchill may have required persuasion from Brendan Bracken to ratify the promotion, Stuart was more successful and popular than Margesson, &#145;his character perfectly suiting the job&#146;, according to Lord Home, his friend and later ministerial colleague  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He did not fuss, assumed a casual air of indifference, showed the gregarious side of his nature, won a reputation for firmness and fairness, and was acknowledged to be a good parliamentary business manager. He also developed an important political and personal relationship with Churchill, although in the judgement of John Colville's Downing Street staff  (Colville, 2.431), the wartime premier respected him rather than particularly liked him. However, Churchill &#145;always listened to his sound political advice&#146;, as both prime minister and party leader.<br>
<br>During the wartime electoral truce, Stuart faced the difficulty of keeping Conservative MPs in line at a time when the leadership took little interest in party matters, and there was a resulting lack of a constructive Conservative policy. As sole chief whip during Churchill's brief caretaker government in 1945, he disagreed with Churchill's negative tactics during the general election campaign and shared in the shock of the party's landslide defeat. His complex relationship with Churchill was strained when, in July 1947, a cabal of senior Conservatives designated him as messenger to suggest that their leader might &#145;seek peace in retirement&#146;  (Stuart, 146). The interaction between the two men was nevertheless a constructive, productive one which Home in his foreword to Stuart's autobiography called &#145;an intimate relationship of mutual understanding and affection&#146;.<br>
<br>Stuart retired as chief whip in 1948, after antrum trouble required an operation, which was the official reason given for his departure, though it was probably brought about by his being named as co-respondent in a divorce case  (<span class="italic">Headlam Diaries</span>, 567, 571, 20 Jan 1949, 1 Feb 1949). When Churchill returned to power in 1951 their relationship gave Stuart an option on the Scottish Office, to the exclusion of Walter Elliot, a more articulate, popular, and urban politician and the most prominent Scot in shadow cabinet and Conservative campaigning. Stuart had already in 1950 been appointed by Churchill to the new post of Scottish party chairman, also chairing the Scottish Unionist MPs' committee.<br>
<br>As secretary of state, Stuart had to cope with a legacy of Scottish discontents after Labour's hard line in face of demands for less centralization and some kind of Scottish self-government. Churchill's brief for Scottish ministers was: &#145;Go and quell those turbulent Scots and don't come back till you've done it&#146;  (Home, 105). Stuart's appointment, pressed on him by Churchill, aroused little enthusiasm and one of Attlee's Scottish team called him a &#145;bloody fool&#146; for taking it  (Stuart, 164). But despite his unspectacular style it was a spectacular success.<br>
<br>In 1955 the Conservatives (still &#145;Unionist&#146; in title) won a narrow absolute majority in Scotland in seats and popular vote, while the Scottish discontents and home-rule movement had subsided. Although this Scottish mood reflected short-term economic conditions, and was to change as heavy industries declined, Stuart had substantially contributed to it. He was a team leader who was also a team player, greatly helped by persuading Churchill to allow him Lord Home as vice-captain (minister of state working mainly and highly visibly in Scotland). The Scottish Office responded to someone with influence in the cabinet and strong on reaching decisions, for example on the go-ahead for the Forth road bridge. He was good at assessing options, respected civil-service briefs when well prepared, and did not intrude much ideology into administration. Even allowing for civil servants' inclination to classify as a &#145;good Secretary of State&#146; someone who took advice well, he thrived in office and presided over an era of good feeling in Scottish life and politics, on relatively amiable terms not only with the opposition in parliament but with Labour-dominated local authorities. However, he confessed: &#145;I do not think I have ever suffered or enjoyed the friendship of a Liberal&#146;  (Stuart, 161).<br>
<br>Stuart practised what his party had preached, though he also secured the backing of the royal commission on the government of Scotland which the Conservatives set up in 1951. This was that administrative devolution to Edinburgh (extended to roads and electricity), relaxation of wartime and post-war controls, and close contact between government and Scottish business, farming, local authorities, and interest groups would weaken the demand for major constitutional change. He was a pragmatic Conservative in social and economic matters who did not ask to see the distant scene, and underestimated the potential for Scottish nationalism, even eventually in his own constituency.<br>
<br>Stuart did commit himself in 1950, writing to the home-rule leader John MacCormick on behalf of Scottish tory MPs, to accepting that &#145;if the Scottish people were ultimately to decide in favour of a Scottish Parliament nothing could gainsay them&#146;  (MacCormick, 139), but his policies and tactics were shaped to prevent the issue being pursued. This remained the Conservative line until electoral disaster in 1997, except for an interlude when Edward Heath and Home contemplated limited legislative devolution. But Stuart went with many trends which Thatcherite Conservatism later found abhorrent, such as the redevelopment of urban Scotland with limited scope for private house building, the creation of vast council housing estates, and an apparently irreversible move towards comprehensive education. However, it was after his retirement, under his brother-in-law Macmillan, that the Scottish Office became most firmly attached to regional economic incentives to encourage industrial developments unable to survive in a freer and globalizing market economy. Much was done under Stuart's regime, however, to encourage diversification of Scottish industry.<br>
<br>Stuart remained at the Scottish Office, under Eden as well as Churchill, until 1957, though unhappy with Eden's leadership and the ignominious Suez climb-down. He retained good looks, trim appearance, and apparent vigour, but pleaded the need for a less arduous life, as well as the avoidance of even the appearance of nepotism, as reasons for retirement when his brother-in-law Macmillan formed a government. He remained as MP and Scottish party chairman, a post which he did not allow to tax his powers, until 1959. He then became, in November 1959, Viscount Stuart of Findhorn, the village where he had his constituency home.<br>
<br>Stuart summed himself up as taking &#145;things as they came&#146;, with chance playing a large part in his life  (Stuart, 1). Unlike many politicians he was honest in claiming that he was not driven by ambition. Home noted an inclination to vanity in personal matters, but also wrote: &#145;He was apparently detached, work-shy, and bored with life: nothing could have been more misleading&#146;  (Home, 103). Beneath &#145;the apparently lackadaisical veneer he had a strong will which it was unwise to test too often&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). For much of his career Stuart divided his time among homes in Findhorn, London, and Salisbury, but in retirement lived mainly near Salisbury. He was made CH in 1957. He died in Salisbury Infirmary on 20 February 1971.<br>
