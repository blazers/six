<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bradford,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1555), <span class="occ">evangelical preacher and martyr</span>, was a native of the parish of Manchester. His parents are said to have been of gentle birth, but little is known for certain of his family, except that he had at least three sisters. He attended Manchester grammar school, and was grateful for the rest of his life for the education he received there.<h2>
<a name="Conversion"></a>Conversion</h2>Between 1544 and 1547 Bradford was employed by Sir John Harington of Exton, Rutlandshire, the vice-treasurer of the English army in France, whom he may have met when Harington was serving in the north for the 1542 Scottish campaign. Harington's French responsibilities included the king's interests and properties at Boulogne, and it is probable that Bradford served as his assistant there. His employment proved far from uncontroversial, however, and he found himself suspected of peculation, at the expense of both the crown and his employer, whom he was alleged to have defrauded of &pound;140. The details remain obscure. When the affair was brought up by Bishop Gardiner in 1553, Bradford denied any offence against Harington, whose own shady dealings complicate in their turn the issue of his employee's possible, but improbable, offence against the crown.<br>
<br>Bradford does not appear to have had any particular penchant for military affairs, and it is not surprising that in 1547 he should have left Boulogne, and on 8 April enrolled at the Inner Temple. Coinciding with this change in career, and even more momentous, was his religious conversion. Crucial roles in this event were played by Thomas Sampson, who stimulated his interest in theology, and by Hugh Latimer, whose fiery preaching evidently so impressed Bradford that he voluntarily began a process of restitution with regard to his offences in France. Further underlining his personal renewal, he also sold a number of valuables and distributed the proceeds among the needy, and thereafter, as Foxe put it, &#145;he gave himself wholly to the study of the holy scriptures&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 7.143). He never married, but as far as possible remained on affectionate terms with members of his family. His sister Margaret married Roger Beswick, who became a devoted protestant, but, although his other sisters and his mother seem to have remained conservative in religion, Bradford never ceased to show himself concerned for their spiritual welfare; this is particularly apparent in letters he wrote to his mother, for instance on 24 February 1554 and 24 June 1555.<br>
<br>Bradford also changed course with regard to his chosen career, as he took full advantage of the growing opportunities to study the new learning. As with others of that generation who were inclined towards humanism, his initial foray into the classics seems modest enough, being a translation of Petrus Artopoeus and John Chrysostom published in 1548 as <span class="italic">The Divisyon of the Places of the Lawe and of the Gospell</span> (ESTC 822). In the early summer of the same year he gained admission to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he clearly met with approval, since on 19 October 1549 he was awarded the degree of MA, following examination by James Pilkington, future bishop of Durham. Three days later he wrote to his friend John Traves, anticipating his election to a fellowship at Pembroke College through the good offices of its master, Nicholas Ridley, who turned out to have been in disputation with Edwin Sandys, master of St Catharine's, as to which college should secure Bradford's services. By the following month he was a fellow of Pembroke, a position he claimed he had never sought, and found himself in the company of Edmund Grindal, and acted as tutor to John Whitgift when the latter arrived in Michaelmas term 1550. It is a sign of his developing eminence that he should also have formed an intimate friendship with the Strasbourg theologian Martin Bucer, who came to Cambridge in 1549. According to Sampson, Bradford kept a sort of journal during his time in Cambridge, recording the important events and thoughts of each day, as an aid to his development as a servant of Christ.<h2>
<a name="Evangelicalpreacher"></a>Evangelical preacher</h2>Bucer intended that Bradford should become a preacher, while Bradford protested that he needed further study before he could take on such a role. But on 10 August 1550 Ridley, now bishop of London, ordained him deacon, gave him a preaching licence, and appointed him one of his own chaplains. On 24 August 1551 he was collated to the prebend of Kentish Town in St Paul's Cathedral, and in December following he was made one of six chaplains in ordinary to the king; it is a sign that Bradford had come to be regarded as a member of a protestant preaching &eacute;lite that his colleagues should have been Grindal, John Knox, John Harley, Andrew Perne, and William Bill. It was intended that at any one time two should be serving at court, while the others travelled through the country preaching reformation. It is unclear how much time Bradford spent away from London, but he certainly preached in Lancashire and Cheshire during 1552, his own writings attesting to a ministry which centred upon Manchester but extended to such places as Liverpool, Bolton, Stockport, and Westchester. His effectiveness was greatest in southern Lancashire, where he spoke to large crowds and attracted a number of converts, though without making much impression upon the gentry of the region. Back at Westminster, he and his fellow chaplains used the Lenten season of 1553 as the occasion for a controversial pulpiteering campaign against sin in high places; Bradford himself went so far as to hold up the duke of Somerset, executed less than a year earlier, as an exemplar of unrighteousness. Sampson records this sermon as having been delivered in the presence of the king himself, and as proclaiming the imminence of divine judgment.<br>
<br>This episode shows that he was not a man to be daunted by authority, and Bradford also proved himself both courageous and responsible in the immediate aftermath of Edward VI's death. On 13 August 1553, accompanied by John Rogers, he acted swiftly to calm disturbances provoked by the Catholic Gilbert Bourne in a sermon at Paul's Cross, risking his safety to the extent that a dagger thrown at Bourne grazed his own clothing. Then during the afternoon he preached in Bow church, Cheapside, and according to Foxe &#145;reproved the people sharply for their seditious demeanour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 7.145). By temperament meek and self-effacing, neither now nor later did Bradford shrink from danger, though he and his comrades became increasingly vulnerable to the dictates of Queen Mary's government. A few days after he had assisted the authorities in the task of crowd control he was summoned before the council in the Tower, where the queen was then resident, and charged with preaching seditious sermons. Imprisoned in the Tower, he was at first incarcerated alone, but was then moved to the place known as the &#145;Nun's bower&#146; with Edwin Sandys. They stayed there for five months. It was clearly government policy to keep the leading protestant prisoners on the move, however, perhaps in the hope of disorientating them, and on 6 February 1554 the two men were separated, Bradford being taken to another room in the Tower, which he shared with Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. On 11 or 12 March the latter were removed to Oxford, and on the 24th Bradford left for Southwark and the king's bench prison there.<h2>
<a name="Prisoneranddisputant"></a>Prisoner and disputant</h2>The king's bench prison became something like a &#145;mother-house&#146; for people charged with heresy; apart from Bradford, its inmates included Robert Ferrar, Rowland Taylor, and John Philpot. Bradford spent some ten months imprisoned here, though his sympathetic character, along with the favour of the knight marshal, Sir William Fitzwilliam, secured for him an unusual amount of freedom. Foxe records that he was given leave to preach twice daily, and even to administer the sacraments. But Bradford's acknowledged holiness of life could not prevent serious theological disputes from arising among the protestant prisoners. He was a leading representative of what was becoming the theological mainstream among Edwardian evangelicals, with a bent decidedly, if not radically, Calvinistic, and increasingly influenced by ideas from Geneva and Strasbourg adapted to English circumstances. Not everyone, however, was eager to jump on the predestinarian bandwagon, and in south-east England, in particular, there was a good deal of interest in countervailing ideas, often also of continental origins. There emerged a group of so-called &#145;free-willers&#146;, led by Henry Harte, who &#145;repudiated with violence the predestinatory doctrines of Calvin&#146;  (Dickens, 328). The result was a spirited debate on the issues of election and free will, conducted through discussions, correspondence, and writings, in and around the various gaols in which protestants had been imprisoned by Queen Mary's government. For the latter the divisions among their opponents provided a cause for satisfaction and matter for propaganda, but for the evangelical cause they were the source of much grief, as its leaders struggled to present a united front to their adversaries by reclaiming as many as possible of the people whom they regarded as their confused or ill-taught brethren.<br>
<br>In these disputes Bradford played a leading part, not only by endeavouring to keep order in the prisons, where feelings sometimes ran very high, but also through his writings. He was in constant correspondence with his opponents, composing such treatises as <span class="italic">To a Free-Willer</span> in 1554, and <span class="italic">To Certain Free-Willers</span> on 1 January 1555, and when matters looked particularly critical he also appealed to Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer in Oxford. With Taylor, Ferrar, and Philpot he forwarded to the imprisoned bishops a text by Harte with the comment:<blockquote>The effects of salvation they so mingle and confound with the cause, that if it be not seen to more hurt will come by them, than ever came by the papists, inasmuch as their life commendeth them to the world more than the papists. (<span class="italic">Writings</span>, 2.170&#150;71)</blockquote>Ridley, at least, took the matter seriously, composing a treatise (probably now preserved among the Fairhurst papers in Lambeth Palace Library) in which he took up a position identical to Bradford's own, rejecting misconceived notions of both free will and predestination in favour of the doctrine of God's election and justification by faith in Christ. It would appear that the party of moderate predestinarianism prevailed, and that a number of free-willers defected to it. Thus Bradford rejoiced over a certain Skelthrop, declaring that God &#145;hath given him to see his truth at the length, and to give place to it&#146;  (ibid., 2.243), but Harte remained obdurate, prompting Bradford's ally John Careless to exclaim &#145;God convert him or confound him shortly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 8.164).<br>
<br>As well as having to confront theological opposition while in prison, Bradford also had once more to face charges of financial mismanagement. Outside assistance was essential if the protestant prisoners were not to risk starvation, and since Bradford was effectively their leader it fell to him to organize the equitable distribution of the donations, whose contributors included Nicholas Ridley and a number of godly women, including Lady Vane from Holborn, Mrs Anne Warcup, and Anne Boleyn's former silkwoman, Joan Wilkinson. He was now accused not of peculation but of favouring his own supporters at the expense of the free-willers when he handed out alms. One of the latter named John Trewe brought such a charge, which Bradford denied with feeling, asserting that he had always been concerned for the well-being of his opponents, and had even devoted to it money intended for his private use. Such unfairness would certainly have been out of character for Bradford, but the allegation underlines the difficulties of his position, that he should have been responsible for the well-being of a number of fellow prisoners whose theological position he was at the same time attacking. The challenges of leadership required unlimited patience and godly wisdom.<h2>
<a name="Temptationsofelection"></a>Temptations of election</h2>Another, and to him doubtless more important, aspect of Bradford's prison ministry was the pastoral one of giving comfort to people who were agonizing over their assurance of salvation. It was a ministry which extended outside the confines of prison, to members of London's godly congregations who looked to him for guidance. Their doubts stemmed largely from the same deterministic doctrines which had prompted debate between Bradford and the free-willers. Thus Margery Coke, greatly disturbed by &#145;temptations of election&#146;, appealed to Bradford for comfort and received a sympathetic response (23 July 1554), even though he was himself in the grip of fever at the time. Some two weeks later Joyce Hales required similar assistance as she wrestled with the same dilemma. Indeed, she became a regular correspondent of Bradford, who faithfully consoled her &#145;with texts and images from <span class="roman">Matthew's gospel</span> and <span class="roman">Romans</span>. He intended to lift her from a deep spiritual crisis, and yet find words which would be applicable to his own, or any Protestant's, plight&#146;  (Wabuda, 249).<br>
<br>It was to Mistress Hales that Bradford dedicated his <span class="italic">Defence of Election</span>, a substantial treatise in which he declares confidently that &#145;Faith of God's election &hellip; is of all things which God requireth of us, not only most principal, but also the whole sum: so that &#147;without this faith&#148; there is nothing that we do that can &#147;please God&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings</span>, 1.307). In another passage he assures readers &#145;that election is so certain that the elect and predestinate to eternal life shall never finally perish or err to damnation finally&#146;  (ibid., 1.314), and he concludes with a firm yet moderate (or &#145;infralapsarian&#146;) statement of the Calvinist position: &#145;But they, because they cannot by their curious reason see how election should be before God, and yet follow Adam's fall to us, therefore they come with their witless, unreasonable, arrogant and very detestable &#147;hows&#148;&#146;  (ibid., 1.330). He also composed two briefer works, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Election and Free-will</span> and <span class="italic">A Brief Sum of the Doctrine of Election and Predestination</span>, again covering controversial ground:<blockquote>God's foresight is not the cause of sin or excusable necessity to him that sinneth: the damned therefore have not nor shall have any excuse, because God, forseeing their condemnation through their own sin, did not draw them, as he doth his elect, unto Christ. (ibid., 1.219)</blockquote>Bradford could also assume a less partisan and more pastoral voice, however, as in his <span class="italic">Sermon on Repentance</span>, speaking as if God were appealing through himself:<blockquote>If, when we hated him and fled away from him, he sent his Son to seek us; who can think otherwise than now we loving him, and lamenting because we love him no more, but that he will for ever love us? (<span class="italic">Writings</span>, 1.75)</blockquote>It is not surprising that men and women anticipating a violent death for their faith should have thought much of their place in the next life. Bradford composed <span class="italic">A Very Godly Prayer of one Standing at the Stake Ready to be Burnt for Christ's Gospel's Sake</span>, and expressed the ultimate hope of his flock in his <span class="italic">Meditation of the Blessed State and Felicity of the Life to Come</span>:<blockquote>Thy angels will gather them together, and they shall meet thee in the clouds, and be always with thee. They shall hear this joyful voice, &#145;Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning&#146;. (ibid., 1.275)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Condemnationanddeath"></a>Condemnation and death</h2>The demands of prison life on Bradford's physical and emotional resources were very great, making it hard to understand how he was able to manage with only four hours' sleep a night, as Foxe records that he did. He enjoyed the companionship of his associates after his meals, but soon turned to reading and prayer. As the Marian persecution gathered momentum at the beginning of 1555, he needed all his strength. Bradford was examined three times at Winchester on 22, 29, and 30 January, and at the last of these sessions he was condemned as a heretic. But although the burning of John Rogers on 4 February might have led him to expect a quick end, he did not suffer until nearly five months later, being held first in the Clink and then in solitude in the Compter in the Poultry, in what was known as the Grocers' Hall court. The reason for the delay was undoubtedly the anxiety of the Catholic authorities to undermine his influence in his native Lancashire, either by executing him there, as was at first expected, or by securing his recantation. On 19 February the writ for his execution was withdrawn and Bradford was subjected to repeated conferences and examinations during that month, March, and April. Among the eminent churchmen and theologians who came to debate with him were Nicholas Heath, archbishop of York, George Day, bishop of Chichester, and the Spanish divines Alfonso de Castro and Bartolom&eacute; Carranza. At one point he was told he could take refuge abroad if only he would recant. His importance was as apparent to his enemies as it was later to be to his protestant successors. In the words of John Strype, Bradford was a man &#145;of whose worth the papists themselves were so sensible, that they took more pains to bring him off from the profession of religion, than any other&#146;  (Strype, 3/1.363&#150;4).<br>
<br>Bradford held firm, and late on 30 June 1555 he was taken back to Newgate. He finally went to the stake at Smithfield on the following day, accompanied by John Leaf, a much younger man, and wearing a new shirt made for him for the occasion by one of his supporters, a Mrs Marler. Foxe describes him as &#145;somewhat tall and slender, spare of body, of a faint sanguine colour, with an auburn beard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 7.145), a representation confirmed by his portrait (in Hampstead Public Library), which shows a sombre scholar-preacher, characteristic of the mid-sixteenth century. Before all else a godly man, he was concerned &#145;to make to himself a catalogue of all the grossest and most enorme sins, which in his life of ignorance he had committed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Writings</span>, 1.33). But there was also a very pleasant and compassionate side to his personality, which even the Jesuit Robert Parsons acknowledged, remarking that Bradford was &#145;of a more soft and mild nature than many of his fellows&#146;  (Loane, 159). It was this combination of qualities which enabled Bradford to give a leadership in prison which was of fundamental importance for the evangelical cause, both at the time and later. In the words of William Haller:<blockquote>But besides being the hero and author of one of the most striking tales in the whole <span class="italic">Book of Martyrs</span>, Bradford also left materials which enabled Foxe to present him as a prototype of all the physicians of the soul who would presently be undertaking the spiritual direction of more and more of Elizabeth's subjects. (Haller, 207)</blockquote>
