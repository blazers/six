<span class="headword">Hawker, Sir  Frank Cyril</span>  (1900&#150;1991), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 21 July 1900 at Walthamstow, Essex, to Frank Charles Hawker, civil servant, and his wife, Bertha Mary Bastow. Educated at the City of London School, Hawker was briefly at the stock exchange and at a firm of solicitors before joining the Bank of England in 1920. He remained there for forty-two years and left only to become chairman of Standard Bank. In 1931 he married Marjorie Anne, daughter of Thomas Henry Pearce and his wife, Amelia Harriet; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>Hawker rose rapidly through the Bank of England's ranks. He served as deputy to George Bolton, when the latter was made head of the bank's new foreign department in 1934. Then he became, successively, deputy chief cashier (1944), chief accountant (1948), adviser to the governor (1953), and executive director (1954).<br>
<br>In 1953 the then governor of the bank asked Hawker to contact various industrialists as part of a crusade to make the bank less isolated. Hawker did so, first in the UK and then in the Commonwealth. For this he was knighted in 1958. He also acquired an extensive knowledge of the banking industry of the Commonwealth and especially of South Africa, which was going through the difficult period that culminated in its withdrawal from the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>In 1962 Hawker was appointed chairman of Standard Bank, whose core business had traditionally been in South Africa. He was one of the few strategic thinkers of his day in the banking profession, and in his new position he tried to restructure and reorganize British overseas banking to meet the needs and pressures of the modern world.<br>
<br>By the 1960s the future of British overseas banking looked bleak. The end of the British empire meant that London was no longer automatically the centre of trade finance. Banks faced a future in which business would have to be fought for, against strong foreign, especially American, competition. Moreover, the advent of new independent governments meant that banks had to confront tough political constraints in areas where traditionally they had had a free hand. Logic therefore dictated that there should be fewer and larger banks, based in London, rather than many localized overseas banks.<br>
<br>Within Standard this idea was known as the &#145;grand design&#146;, and Hawker was its chief proponent. Given the particular political circumstances of South Africa and of emergent Africa, he looked to amalgamation for geographical diversification. While the negotiations were necessarily complex, there were three main strands to this design: a link with a British domestic bank, a link with an American bank, and mergers with other overseas banks. None of these strands was altogether successful, but each set of negotiations resulted in moves which changed the face of British overseas banking. Standard succeeded in consolidating its trans-African persona and in 1969 it amalgamated with the Chartered Bank, which traditionally banked in the East. The merger, creating the Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, was a triumph, though Hawker's considerable management skills were required to combine two very different banking cultures.<br>
<br>As well as being the first chairman of the Standard and Chartered group, Hawker was chairman of the Bank of West Africa (taken over by Standard in 1965) from 1965 to 1973, and of the Union Zairoise de Banques from 1969 to 1974. He was also deputy chairman of Midland and International Banks, and of two industrial companies: Head Wrightson and the Davy Corporation.<br>
<br>Despite his highly successful career Hawker's first love, arguably, was cricket; he was a talented batsman and captained several club sides. He was also a keen footballer and sportsman generally. In later life he became chairman of the Amateur Football Alliance and the Minor Counties Cricket Association; he was the finance committee chairman for the National Playing Fields Association, and then the association's honorary vice-president; and he was vice-chairman of the Football Association. The summit of his sporting career came in 1970&#150;71, when he was made president of the MCC, though his South African connection led to adverse press exposure in a year when the South African touring team visited England.<br>
<br>Hawker died on 22 February 1991 at his home Hadlow Lodge, Burgh Hill, Etchingham, Sussex, aged ninety, and was survived by his wife and daughters.<br>
