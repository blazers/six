<span class="headword">Ashpitel,  Arthur</span>  (1807&#150;1869), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 14 December 1807 in the parish of Clapton, Hackney, Middlesex, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/767/', "William Hurst Ashpitel (1776&#150;1852)")</script>, architect, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peter. He was educated at Dr Burnett's school at Homerton, Hackney, where at the age of twelve he fell and injured his hip, an accident which left him permanently disabled. He trained under his father, and his first commission was the church of St Barnabas at Homerton in 1845. By 1847 he was practising independently at the 5 Crown Court, Old Broad Street, Hackney, and was designing many local churches, schools, and houses. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1845 and 1864, and also submitted designs jointly with John Whichcord jun. from 1852 to 1854.<br>
<br>Ashpitel entered into partnership at Carlton Chambers, Regent Street, in 1850, with John Whichcord, whose Maidstone connections led to many joint commissions in Kent, including churches, schools, hospitals, baths, and wash-houses, as well as mansions and villas, in particular, additions, in 1852, to Lord Abergavenny's house, Birling, Kent. Of these joint commissions in Kent, the following were among those listed by his contemporaries: the churches of Blackheath (St John's), Platt, Postling, and Godmersham; schools at Bexley, Milton, and Rainham; the Kent Infirmary, Ophthalmic Hospital, and Chronic Lunatic Asylum, together with the Cranbrook Union Workhouse; the extension of the London Orphan Asylum at Clapton; and the Hutchison markets. Together Ashpitel and Whichcord also published several pamphlets, including <span class="italic">Town dwellings: an essay on the erection of fireproof houses in flats; a modification of the Scottish and continental systems</span> (1855), an unsuccessful attempt to promote living in apartments, which, although they had been successfully introduced among the residents of Edinburgh, had yet to become an acceptable mode of dwelling in London. After moving to 2 Poet's Corner, Westminster, Ashpitel again worked independently on many and varied projects, including churches, schools, offices, villas, and model artisans' dwellings. The church he built among the ruins at St Dogmael's Abbey, Cardigan, and the church at Aldborough Hatch, Essex, described by a contemporary as &#145;a small but graceful and well-finished early First Pointed building&#146;  (Knight), were among his more notable buildings. Owing to ill health he left Britain in 1853, and travelled with the watercolour artist David Roberts via Paris and Marseilles to Rome, where they stayed for three months. After a further three months in Naples, Ashpitel returned home, having caught a fever at Airolo, Piedmont, which left permanent effects. He had already exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1850 a plate of <span class="italic">Selections from Palladio</span>, but his travels led to the exhibition of two further drawings: in 1858, the elaborate <span class="italic">Restoration of Ancient Rome</span>, and in 1859, <span class="italic">Rome as it is</span>.<br>
<br>Ashpitel became a fellow of the Institute of British Architects in 1841 and was a leading member of the institute's council; he eventually became its vice-president in 1862. He contributed to the sessional papers and architectural dictionary, was a keen supporter of the architectural exhibition, and from 1863 to 1866 served as examiner for the institute's voluntary architectural examination. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1847, and was also a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and took an occasional part in the proceedings of each. He also prepared for the annual congresses of the Archaeological Association, discourses on the cathedral, monastery, or church of the locality where the meeting was held. His publications include <span class="italic">Hand Rails and Staircases: a New and Improved Method of Finding the Lines for Hand-Rails etc.</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">A description and key to the view of ancient Rome, now in the Royal Academy, shewing the authorities for the various restorations</span> (1858). He also edited <span class="italic">A treatise on architecture, including the arts of construction, building, stone-masonry, arch, carpentry, roof, joinery, and strength of materials</span> (1867), a collection of treatises reprinted from the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He contributed architectural articles to the <span class="italic">Arts Quarterly</span>, and to the eighth edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, including the entries on Vanbrugh, Wren, and the Wyatt family. Under his initials he was a frequent contributor on literary subjects to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>, and his verses and translations from the Greek anthology appeared in <span class="italic">The Owl</span>. &#145;A Tory of the old school&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), he also wrote political pamphlets, squibs, and <i>vers de societ&eacute;</i>. A bachelor, Ashpitel died at 2 Poet's Corner, Westminster, on 18 January 1869, leaving a valuable collection of vases and the contents of his library (about 4000 volumes) to the Society of Antiquaries; the latter were subsequently catalogued as &#145;The Ashpitel collection&#146;. His drawings of Rome he left to the nation, and these now form part of the Victoria and Albert Museum collection. He was buried on 25 January 1869 in the family vault at St John's Church, Hackney.<br>
