</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Aitken,  William Maxwell</span>, first Baron Beaverbrook  (1879&#150;1964), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician</span>, was born on 25 May 1879 at the manse, Vaughan, Maple, Ontario, Canada. He was the third son and fifth member of a family of ten children, whose father, William Cuthbert Aitken (1834&#150;1913), was a Presbyterian minister who had emigrated from Torphichen, Linlithgowshire, to Canada in 1864. His mother was Jane (1849&#150;1927), daughter of Joseph Noble, a prosperous storekeeper and farmer in Vaughan. In 1880 William Cuthbert Aitken received the &#145;call&#146; to St James's Church, Newcastle, New Brunswick, where Max Aitken spent his boyhood. Until he was sixteen he attended the local school, where he was described as a bright but idle boy and (an epithet which he was to relish later in life) mischievous. He was also sensitive and nervous and harboured a fear of death that remained with him. If it is true that the child is the father of the man, then Aitken's later character was discernible early on: his school principal noted his ability to size him up &#145;so accurately that he knew exactly every weak point in my character&#146;  (Chisholm and Davie, 24). At sixteen he took the examination for Dalhousie University, but declined to sit the Latin and Greek papers and was refused entrance, which was why he later helped build up the University of New Brunswick as a rival.<h2>
<a name="Makingmoney"></a>Making money</h2>While at school Aitken did various jobs to make money: he acquired a newspaper round and then became the St John <span class="italic">Daily Sun</span>'s Newcastle correspondent, being paid a dollar a column. He sold subscriptions for the <span class="italic">Sun</span> and founded a school newspaper, <span class="italic">The Leader</span>. After his failure to get into university he worked in a local drugstore, but escaped from drudgery by borrowing money from a local lumberjack and moved to Chatham with the intention of qualifying as a lawyer. He was restless and energetic, and showed initiative: he became local correspondent of the <span class="italic">Montreal Star</span> and an agent for the Great West Life insurance company; he also collected debts for a Newcastle doctor. While in Chatham he gained his first experience in politics, persuading a friend to stand for election as an alderman, but when his colleague Richard Bedford Bennett (later prime minister of Canada) left the law firm for which they both worked, Aitken was passed over for promotion. He moved to St John, still intending to become a lawyer, and sold insurance to pay his board. He then followed Bennett to Calgary, where he helped run Bennett's campaign for election to the legislative assembly of the Northwest Territories. Aitken again showed a talent for many things, but to no successful end; in Edmonton he sold meat at a loss, and returned to St John to set up as a full-time insurance agent.<br>
<br>Aitken was now twenty-one and still his restless energy had found no profitable outlet. In 1900 he decided to go to Halifax, where he resolved to do no more &#145;loafing&#146;  (Chisholm and Davie, 33). He was fortunate in his resolve, for at that time Halifax was entering a boom phase, as a growing town that was developing an infrastructure of gas, telephones, and tramways. Aitken sold bonds and became friendly with the family of John F. Stairs, a financial expert and local Conservative who supported the protectionist views then being expounded in England by Joseph Chamberlain. Aitken was an apt pupil, showing powers of flattery and persuasion, and also a certain lack of scruple. Stairs was impressed by Aitken's ability to drive staff and spot talent. Aitken learned the value of using the press to promote his business dealings, and he was good at acquiring inside information and assessing his fellow businessmen. As he became richer he showed his later habit of distributing largess to his family, but he counted every penny when he paid hotel or shop bills; he seemed to resent it when he was not making money, but he was no miser. On 29 January 1906 he married Gladys Henderson Drury (1887/8&#150;1927), who was then eighteen years old. She was the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Drury, the first Canadian to command the Halifax garrison. Aitken wrote, rather ambiguously, in his diary of his hopes that the &#145;experiment&#146; would succeed  (ibid., 56). It did, on Aitken's own terms, but he was to be an unfaithful husband and inveterate pursuer of women, famous or otherwise. It was typical of him to set off, the day after his wedding, to the Royal Security Bank in St John to check up on office management. Aitken and his wife left Halifax for good and moved to Montreal, where he worked as vice-president of Royal Securities. His business dealing reached new levels of intensity: he put money to work, buying and selling companies, starting a weekly magazine, nearly buying the <span class="italic">Montreal Gazette</span>, dealing in stock markets, and becoming involved in Cuba and Puerto Rico.<br>
<br>Aitken's ventures were not always successful, but he won more often than he lost, though he suffered from bouts of depression and illness. Their first child, Janet, was born on 9 July 1908, an event which Aitken reckoned increased the intimacy of his relationship with his wife; but he continued to please himself about when and where he went. In September 1908 he made his first visit to England. Soon after he was embroiled in controversy over his creation of a merger of Canada's cement industry; this was widely criticized in the press, and Aitken showed his anxiety over this when he wrote his little book <span class="italic">Success</span> in 1922. In it he discussed the Canada Cement Company affair, pleading that if he had shown &#145;pliability&#146; then it might have turned into a habit  (Beaverbrook, 74&#150;6). In spring 1910 he paid a second visit to England to raise money to finance the acquisition of a steel company, and his decision to make his life there was probably influenced by the bad odour surrounding the cement merger.<h2>
<a name="Politicsandwar"></a>Politics and war</h2>Aitken's interest in politics was quickened by what he called the &#145;exciting political situation over Chamberlain's plea for a united Empire&#146;  (Chisholm and Davie, 69). This involved the United Kingdom setting a tariff on foreign goods, but giving empire countries a special preferential rate. This policy deeply split the Conservative and Unionist Party when Chamberlain launched his tariff reform crusade in 1903, and the divisions threatened to keep the party in the political wilderness; but the Liberals were certainly going to remain the party of free trade, and Aitken's political ambitions could lie nowhere else than with the Unionists, at least if they could be persuaded to adopt tariff reform. Aitken met the future Unionist leader Andrew Bonar Law, and on his third visit to England in autumn 1910 he met Law again. The two men got on well, despite their very different individual temperaments: both had Scots-Canadian connections, both were sons of the manse, both were businessmen.<br>
<br>In the world of Edwardian politics Aitken's chief talents&#151;his ability to cultivate friendships, influence people, and make money&#151;were at a premium. In November 1910 Law recommended him as a possible parliamentary candidate for Ashton under Lyne. Aitken hesitated, thinking he was being offered a seat really intended for a working-class Conservative candidate, but he finally agreed to stand if he were given sufficient political support from leading Unionists such as F. E. Smith. Aitken was an efficient campaign organizer and he had money to spend on publicity. His wife was an able helper and Aitken, though not a natural public speaker&#151;he acknowledged that his wife was better at this&#151;won the seat by 196 votes. His victory was given added value by the fact that it was one of the few Unionist successes in the general election of December 1910.<br>
<br>Aitken was neither an effective nor a comfortable member of parliament. He rarely spoke in the House of Commons, and made little mark. He was knighted in 1911, not because of his political achievements, but in expectation of future contributions to Unionist Party funds. Aitken bought Cherkley Court, a large house near Leatherhead, Surrey, which became a centre of political gatherings. When Law replaced A. J. Balfour as leader of the Unionists in 1911, Aitken's stock rose accordingly. His delight in acting as a political go-between found outlet in 1913 when he offered his house for negotiations on the Ulster question and Irish home rule then being conducted between Law and H. H. Asquith, the Liberal prime minister.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Aitken made his first serious move into what was to be the real love of his life: journalism. He had already dabbled in the trade in Canada, founding the weekly <span class="italic">Canadian Century</span> in 1910 and saving the <span class="italic">Montreal Herald</span> from collapse by giving it $150,000 (and decisively influencing its change from a Liberal to a Conservative newspaper). In the same year he met R. D. Blumenfeld, editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, whose newspaper also needed an injection of funds. Aitken wrote a cheque for &pound;25,000 without collateral, thus beginning his long connection with the <span class="italic">Express</span> on terms highly favourable to himself. He tried to buy <span class="italic">The Standard</span>, but failed, but he got effective control of <span class="italic">The Globe</span>, which, though it proved an unsuccessful newspaper, gave him experience in journalism and its practitioners. The <span class="italic">Express</span> was still failing to pay its way, and Aitken was involved in yet another salvage operation on behalf of the Unionist Party; more importantly, he realized that the impact of the &#145;new journalism&#146; launched by Lord Northcliffe had come to stay, and that this popular paper was the kind he wanted to own. He had to wait until November 1916 before finally getting his desire, paying &pound;17,500 for shares which enabled him to take control of the <span class="italic">Express</span>, retaining Blumenfeld as editor. He kept the deal secret because he had learned by now that politicians, though they cultivated the press and even subsidized it, also resented its claim to speak to the people over their heads.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in August 1914 gave Aitken his chance to demonstrate that he was (to his own satisfaction at any rate) a significant political player. But at first it was his publicity skills that were most useful. In January 1915 he became honorary lieutenant-colonel and was appointed to &#145;take charge of the work connected with records generally appertaining to the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force&#146;  (Chisholm and Davie, 125&#150;6). He was made Canadian record officer, and in January 1916 published his first book, <span class="italic">Canada in Flanders</span>, vol. 1. His utter commitment to the war effort aroused his hostility to Asquith, who by 1915 was under attack for his mismanaging of the war. When Asquith reconstructed his cabinet in May 1915, Aitken did not get a post, and his antipathy to Asquith increased when Law tried to get Aitken appointed KCMG on the colonial list, but was prevented by Asquith. In the political intrigue that ended in Asquith's being replaced as prime minister by David Lloyd George in December 1916, Aitken was credited then and later (not least by himself) as a key figure in the business, but his account of the affair is at certain points debatable or wrong, and his use of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> to undermine Asquith may have been counter-productive. However, there is no doubt about his enjoyment of the crisis, and his role as go-between. Aitken later claimed that he expected to be included in Lloyd George's administration as president of the Board of Trade, but it seems unlikely that such an offer would have been made; in any event, no job emerged, but Aitken acquired a peerage, despite the king's objections, and Lord Beaverbrook, as he became, had collected material for his first major excursion into writing history, his <span class="italic">Politicians and the War</span> (1928). He was clearly a man to be reckoned with, and he would not be kept out of places of power for long. But he had to be careful: when in 1917 his control of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> became known, he was criticized by Conservative central office because, instead of doing the respectable thing and subsidizing loyal party newspapers, he was putting his money into an independent and, in central office's view, irresponsible non-party publication.<br>
<br>Beaverbrook's understanding of the key role of publicity in wartime secured him the position as head of the propaganda committee under the control of the department of information, and in February 1918 he became the first ever minister of information. He was also made chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, with a seat in the cabinet. The appointment of a press lord, whose ranks Beaverbrook now openly joined, provoked political criticism, with Austen Chamberlain leading the attack. Beaverbrook decided to concentrate his propaganda efforts on using the press as the best means of promoting the British and allied cause. He made contact with people who had knowledge of foreign countries, but he met opposition from ministers, including Balfour, who resented his attempts to use their departments and networks for his own purposes. Beaverbrook was not a man to live long under frustrating circumstances, and he offered to resign in June 1918. His ministerial demise came, not over this, but from a leader in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> on 29 August 1918 declaring that, unless Lloyd George gave pledges on tariff reform and imperial preference, the <span class="italic">Express</span> would no longer support him. Lloyd George was furious, and the episode seemed to demonstrate the arrogance of the press barons. Beaverbrook stayed on until October 1918, and even after he went, pleading ill health, he threw the <span class="italic">Express</span> behind Lloyd George in the general election that Lloyd George and Law planned for December 1918.<h2>
<a name="Presslord"></a>Press lord</h2>Beaverbrook now threw his energies into making his newspaper business as successful as he had his other concerns. In 1919 the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> circulation was under 400,000; but by 1930 it was 1,693,000 and in 1937 it stood at 2,329,000, the largest circulation of any newspaper in the British Isles. This was because of its popular, aggressive tone, but also its optimism, enthusiasm, and claim to speak for those who were, like Beaverbrook himself, determined to stand up for themselves and take control of their own lives. There were also lively features, and all this in the style of the new journalism. Beaverbrook, like his great predecessor Northcliffe, was careful to keep up with the new technology and to experiment with layout. Unlike Northcliffe he did not use stunts to promote sales: his success was based on his belief in the importance of the words on the page, and to this end he hired first-rate staff&#151;financial writers like Francis Williams and the great cartoonist David Low (whom Beaverbrook brought to the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> in 1927). He kept tight control of his editors. One of the <span class="italic">Express</span>'s long-serving editors, Arthur Christiansen, recollected &#145;feeling sick when Neville Chamberlain described Czechoslovakia as &#147;a far away country&#148;&#146; but when he expressed his opinion Beaverbrook said &#145;Well, isn't Czechoslovakia a far away country?&#146; and &#145;I agreed that it was and got on with my job of producing an exciting newspaper&#146;  (Chester and Fenby, 23). Yet Beaverbrook allowed Low, in the words of the Political and Economic Planning <span class="italic">Report on the British Press</span> published in 1938, to &#145;hold up the whole of capitalist society to ridicule&#146;  (p. 178).<br>
<br>The paper stressed optimism. Francis Williams reminded Arthur Christiansen of his desire to &#145;make everyone feel it was a sunny day&#146;  (Christiansen, 151). The <span class="italic">Express</span> was ever-vigilant on behalf of the British people; in its coverage of the food shortage of 1946, and bread rationing, it complained that &#145;ex-enemies get more&#146; and printed pictures of a beauty treatment in Paris which required using eight eggs and two double cognacs  (&#145;Report of the royal commission on the press&#146;, 331). A. J. P. Taylor put the <span class="italic">Express</span>'s success down to the fact that its owner was indifferent to the British class system, holding that &#145;there was no difference between rich and poor except that the rich had more money&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">English History</span>, 310). But the <span class="italic">Express</span> did have its roots in what at the end of the twentieth century has been called &#145;middle England&#146;. The Political and Economic Planning <span class="italic">Report on the British Press</span> carried out a survey of British newspaper readership, revealing that the bulk of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> readers were from social groups whose chief earner in the family brought in between &pound;125 and &pound;500 a year, concluding that &#145;in the middle grade of the population, the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> held sway&#146;  (pp. 231, 235).<br>
<br>Beaverbrook made mistakes: the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, which he launched in December 1918, failed to attract good circulation and soon used up the &pound;500,000 that he put into it; but when he made John Junor editor in 1928 it began to make money. Beaverbrook enjoyed the newspaper world. He liked attacking his enemies and supporting his friends. He loved picking up gossip to use in his newspapers, but he would also suppress a story if he were asked to by his wide circle of friends. Equally, he enjoyed playing fast and loose with the Conservative Party, broadly supporting it while finding fault with its policies and leaders when he saw fit. However, he did not seek to expand his empire indefinitely. In 1923 he bought the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> for himself and Lord Rothermere, and got a controlling influence in the Glasgow <span class="italic">Evening Citizen</span>. He installed machinery so that he could print the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in Manchester, and in 1928 he started the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily Express</span>; but that was as far as he went.<br>
<br>Beaverbrook was less successful in his direct political campaigns. Between 1919 and 1922 he followed Northcliffe's example in claiming to speak for the people, and he attacked Lloyd George's coalition government on a whole range of issues, from British intervention in Russia to the question of London slums. His interest in politics quickened after the death of Bonar Law in October 1923. Beaverbrook claimed that he had been the key figure in persuading Law to attend the Carlton Club meeting in 1922 which brought down the Lloyd George administration, but his relations with Law were troubled by the latter's refusal fully to endorse tariff reform. Beaverbrook funded and supported independent Conservative candidates, and once Law had gone he was able to take the gloves off. For the next fifteen years he devoted his political will to endeavouring to remove Stanley Baldwin from the Conservative leadership. Partly this was because Beaverbrook soon realized that he had no hold over Baldwin when Baldwin called a general election in the autumn of 1923 against Beaverbrook's advice. His anger grew when Baldwin fought the election on the issue of protection, but without special terms for the empire. Nevertheless, he supported the Conservatives' election campaign, but, the election lost, he wrote disparagingly of Baldwin in the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>: Baldwin, the paper wrote, was now stripped of his power and patronage and must rely on his own capabilities which had so far &#145;proved of second rank&#146;  (Koss, 2.434). Beaverbrook and Rothermere persuaded Winston Churchill to stand as an independent constitutionalist in a by-election in the Abbey division of Westminster on a platform of imperial preference. In May 1925 the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> warned that independent Conservatives would again &#145;arise&#146; and that it was quite likely that the <span class="italic">Express</span> would support them  (Boyce, &#145;Crusaders without chains&#146;, 106). By 1929 he was ready to launch his bid for power, a bid he felt sure must succeed for, as he wrote in 1926, &#145;when skilfully employed at the psychological moment no politician of any party can resist (the press)&#146;  (Chisholm and Davie, 276).<br>
<br>Clearly Beaverbrook saw himself as the reincarnation of the great Northcliffe. There was another passing resemblance, and that was Beaverbrook's inability to remain faithful to his wife. It is hard to see how his marriage would have avoided strain, given Beaverbrook's lifestyle, but matters became more fraught in 1925 when he began to see Jean Norton (<i>d</i>. 1945), a society lady of considerable beauty, whom Lady Beaverbrook saw as at any rate an improvement on the &#145;actresses&#146; who had attracted her husband hitherto. Old friends began to invite Beaverbrook and Jean Norton together, and some noticed an increasing coarseness in his treatment of his wife. Lady Beaverbrook and her daughter Janet spent some time in Canada in the winter of 1926 and summer 1927, when Lady Beaverbrook began to show signs of illness. In April 1927 she returned to England, still unwell; doctors could find nothing wrong with her, but she died from a brain tumour on 1 December. Beaverbrook retained enough of his Presbyterian upbringing to feel guilty, and he destroyed all his wife's papers, including her letters to him. Some said he ensured that her nurse would remain silent, lest his wife had let slip some damaging revelation. Beaverbrook told a friend that he wished he could turn the clock back twenty years, but he was soon to find consolation in the world that he now lived in, one dominated for the next decade by economic turmoil and political danger.<h2>
<a name="Empirecrusader"></a>Empire crusader</h2>Characteristically, Beaverbrook rode out the great financial crash of 1929, selling shares before it struck. But he saw the opportunity for mobilizing opinion behind an empire crusade&#151;a crusade for protection and imperial preference&#151;in the crisis that overtook the world's markets. His brief, and not particularly happy, experience of cabinet government in 1917&#150;18 had not dulled his appetite for political power, and while he would not have looked as far as Lord Rothermere, who hoped to see Beaverbrook in 10 Downing Street, he certainly believed that press lords had the power to &#145;coerce politicians&#146;  (Chisholm and Davie, 275).<br>
<br>Beaverbrook now set his sights firmly on the moving target of Stanley Baldwin, whom he believed to be a stubborn man and therefore weak and vacillating. Beaverbrook launched his crusade on 8 July 1929; it would not only be a newspaper campaign, but would involve creating a new political party. The new party started well: it enrolled 173,000 members in a fortnight and one Conservative noted that his party's rank and file were &#145;seething with uncertainty and unrest&#146;  (Boyce, &#145;Crusaders without chains&#146;, 107). In July 1929 Conservative central office repudiated Sir John Ferguson as candidate for the Twickenham by-election because of his open support for empire free trade; Ferguson won the seat anyway. Thus encouraged, Beaverbrook put his own party's candidate forward in the West Fulham by-election of May 1930 and won, and in October an Empire Free Trade candidate won in South Paddington. But Beaverbrook's ambitions were damaged as much as enhanced by these successes. To unseat Baldwin he must, in the end, pressurize the Conservative Party into accepting his doctrine; but setting his candidates against official Conservatives angered the party, and when one success, in East Islington in January&#150;February 1931, let in the Labour candidate through a Conservative split vote, then it was clear to most Conservatives that Beaverbrook posed a threat to that most essential political need: party unity. The downfall followed remarkably quickly. In the St George's Westminster by-election in March 1931 Baldwin counter-attacked, accusing the press lords of seeking &#145;power without responsibility&#146;  (Boyce, &#145;The fourth estate&#146;, 35). The words were Kipling's and they hit home. Baldwin's candidate, Duff Cooper, won; and in September 1931 Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart wrote in his diary that Brendan Bracken &#145;thinks that Max will be the last of his trade and that the reign of the great press lords is coming to an end&#146;  (Boyce, &#145;Crusaders without chains&#146;, 108).<br>
<br>The empire crusade was effectively over. Now Beaverbrook seemed to be an inveterate picker of lost causes. He backed Edward VIII in his attempt to retain the throne, hardly realizing that the king did not want to be saved at the expense of losing Mrs Simpson (whom Beaverbrook did not find attractive). Beaverbrook, who was no monarchist and confessed that he &#145;scarcely knew the King&#146;, was motivated by his desire, as he put it, to &#145;bugger Baldwin&#146;  (Birkenhead, 138). His strong support of appeasement in the late 1930s was more in line with political as well as public opinion; few people in Britain wanted to admit that war on the continent of Europe was inevitable. Beaverbrook no doubt spoke for many when he supported the Munich agreement, with the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> claiming on 22 September 1938 that Britain had made no pledge to protect the frontiers of Czechoslovakia, but he pushed the point too far. In March 1939 he denied that Neville Chamberlain had made any absolute guarantee to Poland, and when war broke out in September Beaverbrook's confident assurances over the past few years that there would be no war this year or the next looked, to say the least, hollow. Beaverbrook's hostility to the war was compounded by his notion that the renamed duke of Windsor might be persuaded to stump the country calling for a compromise peace. However, the British failure in an expedition to Norway in April 1940 changed his mind. On 10 May he lunched with Churchill and thereafter threw his energy behind the war effort. Churchill asked the king to appoint Beaverbrook minister of aircraft production, knowing how good Beaverbrook was at inspiring and driving staff. On 14 May, aged sixty, Beaverbrook took over responsibility for repairs to damaged aircraft, as well as production of new planes. On 2 August he became a member of the war cabinet.<h2>
<a name="Inandoutofpower"></a>In and out of power</h2>There can be no doubt about Beaverbrook's commitment to the task, which he approached in his usual energetic and domineering style. Characteristically, he exaggerated his contribution to the increase in aircraft production, the numbers of which had been rising before he took up his position. He made some mistakes, for example in reducing the production of aircraft suitable for the vital role of photo-reconnaissance. His abrasive methods annoyed other departments and especially the Air Ministry, and he soon found his job irksome. He intimated to Churchill that he wished to go, and on 30 April 1941 his resignation was accepted. However, he now became minister of state because Churchill wanted to retain him in the cabinet; in addition he was made deputy chairman of the defence committee (supply), but with no executive function. He found this frustrating and in June 1941 got the Ministry of Supply for himself. But now a new crusade was on the horizon.<br>
<br>In September 1941 Beaverbrook went to Moscow to persuade the USSR to stay in the war. He met Stalin and believed that the two of them had established a rapport. He was certain that Stalin could be trusted, and urged Britain to help the USSR in every way it could. To this end he approved of the USSR's retaining much of eastern Poland, the Baltic states, part of Romania, and some of Finland after the war. His political position in Britain was strengthened when Churchill made him minister of production in February 1942. Beaverbrook's temperament was not suitable for the task, however, and he quarrelled with Ernest Bevin over control of shipbuilding and labour. His resignation came after only twelve days in office, on 20 February; but at least he was now free to devote himself to the cause of supporting the USSR in the war. In June 1942 he addressed a large crowd in Birmingham, calling for the allies to open a second front in Europe, and he pushed this cause with his usual energy and single-mindedness. Nevertheless, the suspicion that dogged Beaverbrook's motives persisted, for some thought that he was really scheming to supplant Churchill as prime minister. In September 1943 he returned to the cabinet as lord privy seal, where he used his business acumen to better effect in planning post-war air routes across the Atlantic; but he became bored with the detail of negotiations and decided that he would devote himself to assisting Churchill to win the general election that would follow the end of the war. Any notion that press lords could swing the electorate was damaged by the large Labour Party victory in 1945; and the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>'s claim that there would be &#145;Gestapo in Britain&#146; if Labour won was a misjudgement of the public mood  (Chisholm and Davie, 453&#150;4).<br>
<br>Beaverbrook's loss of touch was revealed also by his advice to Churchill in 1945 not to publish the Conservative Party's proposals for the health service, on the grounds that it was &#145;inexpedient&#146;  (Thomas, 38). He argued that free enterprise was the way forward, but he was not a consistently right-wing thinker: the cold war was, he thought, unnecessary. He still clung to the ideas of imperial unity, freedom from foreign entanglements, and a distant relationship with the United States of America, all of which&#151;though not necessarily mistaken&#151;were out of touch with the times. He remained the empire crusader, opposing British acceptance of an American loan in 1947, and, above all, against the British application to join the European Common Market (EEC) in 1961. His bitter attack on Europe derived its venom from his hatred of Germany. He complained that the EEC was &#145;an American device to put us alongside Germany. As our power was broken and lost by two German wars, it is very hard on us now to be asked to align ourselves with those villains&#146;  (Horne, 2.262).<br>
<br>Beaverbrook's press power continued to be the object of criticism, not least from the 1947 royal commission on the press. He maintained that this was intent on persecuting him, provoked by what was regarded&#151;justifiably&#151;as his policy of using his papers to blacklist people he did not like, and of retaining too tight a control over his editors. As usual, Beaverbrook adopted attack as the best means of defence, telling an astonished commission that he ran his papers for propaganda purposes, and that if an editor opposed a policy that was dear to his heart, such as empire free trade, then he &#145;talked&#146; him out of it  (&#145;Report of the royal commission on the press&#146;, 43). Beaverbrook went on to say: &#145;No paper is any good at all for propaganda unless it has a thoroughly good financial position. So we worked very hard to build up a commercial position on that account&#146;  (ibid., 26). He admitted that the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>'s commercial position was built on its ability to give its readers what they liked; and the Political and Economic Planning <span class="italic">Report on the British Press</span> had noted in 1938 that the chief subjects covered in the <span class="italic">Express</span> in a chosen period (28 February&#150;6 March 1938) were indeed law (including crime, police, divorce, and suicide), accidents, film stars and films, and sport. Such topics as industry, science, medicine, education, and labour relations came well down the list, and unemployment was completely absent. More evasively, Beaverbrook told the royal commission that editors must have a degree of latitude, but must also be carried along with the proprietor's views. The commission noted that Beaverbrook picked staff who shared his views and policies, and controlled the newspapers even when his presence was removed.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandreputation"></a>Last years and reputation</h2>In 1951 Beaverbrook ceased to renew his membership of the Conservative Party and it was from that year that the empire crusader on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> masthead was draped in chains. This was significant. Beaverbrook's Presbyterian upbringing, though it seems to have exercised no influence on his private life, was perhaps manifested in his restless quest for a crusade&#151;for a great cause that could be given a moral as well as political dimension. But from now on there were no great causes, or at least none that held any possibility of success: opposition to Europe was an example. Yet Beaverbrook was excited by the recognition of his role as a historian of his own times. When A. J. P. Taylor reviewed Beaverbrook's <span class="italic">Men and Power</span> in 1956, describing it as &#145;one of the most exciting works of history&#146; he had ever read and its author as a great historian, comparable to Tacitus, Beaverbrook was delighted  (Chisholm and Davie, 502). This was the start of a close friendship between the two, with Taylor witnessing to Beaverbrook's charm, and his ability to &#145;steal the hearts of men&#146;  (ibid., 503). Taylor remarked on Beaverbrook's restlessness in old age, with journeys to Jamaica, the Bahamas, France, New York, and Canada. He still ran the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> as a very successful newspaper, with talented staff. A collector of political papers, his purchases included those of Lloyd George and Bonar Law, which were later opened to historians in the Beaverbrook Library in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> building, under the benign gaze of A. J. P. Taylor, its director. The University of New Brunswick, of which he became chancellor in 1953, received an endowment from him, as well as funding for founding scholarships and a new library and art gallery. He still aroused controversy, even in old age, with accusations of vendettas and sexual misbehaviour. Still accused of being unable to treat women with dignity, Beaverbrook nevertheless found a regular companion in <a href="#cosubject_54730">Marcia Anastasia Dunn [<i>see below</i>]</a>, widow of Sir James Dunn, whom he married on 7 June 1963. Just over a year later, on 9 June 1964, he died of cancer at Cherkley. Beaverbrook's elder son, (John William) Max Aitken (1910&#150;1985), succeeded to the baronetcy but disclaimed the barony, maintaining that &#145;there will be only one Lord Beaverbrook&#146;.<br>
<br>Beaverbrook's reputation was controversial in his day, and has remained so, as new information has emerged. He made gifts to many people, some famous, some obscure; but this was seen by many as his way of controlling and corrupting. Cecil King, who like Clement Attlee described Beaverbrook as &#145;evil&#146;, wrote that &#145;he seemed to take pleasure in humiliating and corrupting his young men, preventing them from breaking loose by absurdly over-paying them&#146;  (Gourley, 40). Yet this might also be regarded as sound business sense: keeping talented staff by paying them well was hardly unusual. The question was whether this went further, and was a means of buying, not simply employing, people; but Beaverbrook employed David Low, whose cartoons were entirely of Low's own creation. He also gave money to those whose political ideas he did not agree with, and whom he did not control. Notably, Michael Foot was given &pound;3000 to help save the left-wing journal <span class="italic">Tribune</span> from extinction. Yet even this could be construed as having a personal, or at least political, motive, that of promoting discord within the Labour Party.<br>
<br>Many bore witness to his charm, especially A. J. P. Taylor. Among his unlikely conquests was Aneurin Bevan, who enjoyed both Beaverbrook's hospitality and his conversation, and&#151;to the disgust of Tom Clarke of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>&#151;&#145;addressed Beaverbrook familiarly as Max&#146;  (Campbell, 64). Yet Bevan carefully avoided Beaverbrook's efforts to place him directly in his debt, by way of offers of money to pay for medical treatment, and of a cottage on the Cherkley estate. Beaverbrook's appearance was most unprepossessing. One journalist described him as looking &#145;like some genial spider&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fleet Street</span>, 93), while others were less complimentary.<br>
<br>Beaverbrook seems to have possessed the gift of making those to whom he spoke feel that he was solely interested in them. But he was sensitive and nervous about his own image, and his self-absorption was seen in his efforts to exercise control over one of his biographers, Tom Driberg. Beaverbrook influenced the text, yet managed to keep this secret, so that what was in reality a vetted work was regarded by many at the time as a highly critical biography, though the perceptive Evelyn Waugh dismissed it as a &#145;honeyed eulogy&#146;, and complained that &#145;you give little impression of the deep malevolence of the man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 467). Beaverbrook disliked yielding centre stage, even to his first wife and his eldest son. His political adventures ended largely in failure. He made his career in England, but he remained devoted to the Canada he left for good in 1910, and he estimated that he had given $16 million to various causes and institutions in New Brunswick. He formally renounced his United Kingdom citizenship on 17 December 1951, and his ashes were laid to rest at Newcastle, New Brunswick, Canada, on 25 September 1964.<br>
<br>Some even regarded Beaverbrook as essentially an outsider: the Canadian who, whatever his wealth and ambitions, remained outside the establishment. But his significance does not lie in his political ambitions and causes, which largely failed, nor in his financial acumen, but in his talent for producing a brilliant newspaper. The <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> may not have exercised the political influence that Beaverbrook aspired to, but it represented a certain kind of Britain, or more properly England, at a particular era in its history. Beaverbrook was a shrewd picker of staff who recognized a first-rate journalist when he saw one. But he owed his success mainly to what he himself described as &#145;prejudice and breadth of vision. It's a rare combination&#146;  (Chisholm and Davie, 7&#150;8). And one that Beaverbrook possessed, though in what proportions will always be a matter of controversy.<br>

<a name="cosubject_54730"></a><span class="headword">Marcia Anastasia Aitken <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Christoforides]</span></span>, Lady Beaverbrook <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Marcia Anastasia Dunn, Lady Dunn]</span>  (1909&#150;1994), <span class="occ">racehorse owner</span> and Beaverbrook's second wife, was born on 27 July 1909 at Kaisaria, Cheam Road, Sutton, Surrey, the daughter of John Christoforides (or Christoforidi), a Greek-Cypriot tobacco merchant, and his wife, Mildred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boys. Educated partly at Roedean School, in 1930 she became secretary&#151;initially paid 30<i>s</i>. a week&#151;to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46892/', "Sir James Hamet Dunn, first baronet (1874&#150;1956)")</script>, a London-based Canadian financier, who bought his baronetcy via the Lloyd George political fund. He returned to Canada and in 1935 took charge of the Algoma Steel Corporation of Ontario (gaining full control in 1944); she followed and became its assistant secretary. After his second wife divorced him, and after she had nursed him through a near fatal illness, he married her on 7 June 1942. Following his death, on 1 January 1956, she inherited half his fortune (estimated at nearly C$70 million). She gave a science block and endowed law scholarships at Dalhousie University, New Brunswick, of which Dunn had been a graduate. Grief-stricken, she talked of entering a convent. Instead she became the constant companion of Lord Beaverbrook, a friend of Dunn since boyhood. He used her diary in writing his memoir of Dunn, <span class="italic">Courage</span> (1961), which she disliked. Reportedly she and Beaverbrook secretly plighted their troth at the church at Torphichen, West Lothian, in 1961. On 7 June 1963 he married her at Epsom register office. He repeatedly said that she was richer than he was, and it was conjectured that he hoped&#151;though in vain&#151;that she might divert funds to his Beaverbrook foundation at the University of New Brunswick. She became a trustee of the Beaverbrook foundations and was put on the board of Beaverbrook newspapers. On 9 June 1964 Beaverbrook died in her arms. She was bequeathed none of his fortune. According to A. J. P. Taylor, &#145;Beaverbrook had no doubt planned to play off Christofor against Max after his own death&#146;  (Taylor, <span class="italic">Beaverbrook</span>, 671), but she ended her connection with his newspapers.<br>
<br>Through her friendship with Lord Rosebery&#151;and although both her husbands had deplored the racing world&#151;Lady Beaverbrook became a leading racehorse owner and supporter of British racing. She was known in racing circles as Lady B, and her colours were beaver brown with maple-leaf green cross-belts. Devoted to her horses, she habitually gave them seven-letter names. Her pride and joy was Boldboy, who won more prize money than any other gelding trained in Britain: she made provision for him in her will. At the zenith of her career she employed Sir Gordon Richards as her racing manager. In total she owned more than 250 winners, and she was twice second in the owners' table. Following Beaverbrook's death she also renewed her interest in Dalhousie, which awarded her an honorary LLD degree in 1967 and of which she became chancellor in 1968. The university welcomed her money but resented her interference. Despite her wealth, some aspects of her life were austere. She died, childless, of liver failure and cancer at her Surrey home, Cherkley Court, Leatherhead, on 28 October 1994.<br>
