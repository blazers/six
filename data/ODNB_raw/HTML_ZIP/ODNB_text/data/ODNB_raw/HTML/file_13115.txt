<span class="headword">Hervey,  John</span>  (1616&#150;1680), <span class="occ">politician and courtier</span>, was born on 18 August 1616 and baptized at Ickworth church on the 27th. He was the eldest son and heir of Sir William Hervey (<i>d</i>. 1660) of Ickworth, Suffolk, MP for Bury St Edmunds in 1628&#150;9, and Susan, daughter of Sir Robert Jermyn, kt, of Rushbrook, Suffolk. Hervey was attached to the household of Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester, as ambassador to France in 1636, with whom he contracted a warm friendship. He was educated and travelled abroad, including a period at Leiden in 1637. He served as a gentleman of the privy chamber and a captain of horse in the royalist forces, raising a troop for the king, from <i>c</i>.1642 to 1646. He compounded in 1646 for goods and chattels worth &pound;240. In 1658 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1700), daughter and heir of Sir William Hervey, later Baron Hervey of Ross, co. Wexford, and Kidbrooke, Kent. She brought an estate worth &pound;30,000.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Hervey was named a JP for Suffolk and a commissioner for assessment for that county and Westminster. Subsequently, he served in the same capacity for Middlesex and Norfolk, being named in 1673 and 1677 respectively. In 1662 Hervey was named a commissioner for loyal and indigent officers for Suffolk. But he preferred life at court to his local responsibilities, leaving the management of his estate to his brother, Sir Thomas Hervey, kt (1625&#150;1694), later MP for Bury St Edmunds. A client of his cousin, the earl of St Albans, John Hervey was named in 1662 treasurer of the household and receiver general to the queen. On 7 December 1664 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, but never presented himself for admission. In 1675 he became a commissioner for recusants for Suffolk and, in 1677, a charter member of the Royal Fishery Company.<br>
<br>Hervey was elected MP for Hythe in 1661 on the recommendation of the lord warden and the earl of Sandwich. He was not an active member. Burnet relates an anecdote about Hervey, who was much in favour with Charles II, which illustrates the parliamentary dilemma faced by court members. Having voted against the court in an important division, Hervey was rebuked by the king. The next day, upon entering the government lobby after a more compliant vote, the king remarked &#145;You were not against me to day.&#146; Hervey replied, &#145;No sir, I was against my conscience to day&#146;  (Burnet, 2.73). Hervey was a patron of Abraham Cowley and a shareholder in the Duke of York's Theatre. He died on 18 January 1680 and was buried in Ickworth church on the 23rd. His Latin epitaph has been translated as &#145;distinguished in character, powerful in intellect, bountiful in favour, impeccable in judgment, abundant in blessings&#146; (Hervey, 2.147; Henning, 3.540). He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, who died in 1700. They had no children.<br>
