<span class="headword">Taylor,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1756, <em>d.</em> 1788), <span class="occ">decorative artist and painter</span>, was baptized at South Leith on 21 January 1756, the son of Peter Taylor and his wife, Katherine Carfrae. On 21 March 1786 he married Elizabeth Low and resided in West Register Street, Edinburgh, where he worked as a coach painter and interior decorator. He is said to have painted portraits of his friends, but his seated, half-length portrait, executed in oils on a small wooden panel, of Burns is the only work definitely attributed to him.<br>
<br>Burns and Taylor met in December 1786, shortly after the poet's arrival in Edinburgh, at a dinner party which extended into the small hours. Burns agreed on the spur of the moment to sit for his portrait the very next morning. He gave three sittings, taking breakfast with Taylor before each session. Mrs Taylor was present at the last and by far the longest session shortly before Burns left Edinburgh on 5 May 1787.<br>
<br>The existence of this portrait was unknown until 1812 when James Hogg and two friends paid a visit to Taylor's widow. Mrs Taylor opened a clothes-press and removed the small wooden panel from a little box. Hogg commented, &#145;It is particularly like Robert in the form and air; with regard to venial faults I care not&#146;  (J. Hogg, letter of 27 Nov 1829 cited in <span class="italic">Burns Chronicle</span>, 1, 1892, 86). Several of the poet's contemporaries, when shown the Taylor portrait, failed to recognize Burns and thought that it might be his brother Gilbert; but both Burns's widow, Jean, and his confidante Mrs Agnes McLehose (Clarinda), as well as Sir Walter Scott and Mrs Dunlop of Dunlop, considered it a good likeness. Mrs Taylor's account was confirmed by the engraver John Burnet who stated that a friend of his, at one time in Taylor's employment, recalled him working on the painting. The panel has the inscription &#145;T. 1786&#146; on the reverse, although that could have been added at a later date. This painting was used as the basis of J. Horsburgh's engraving, executed in December 1829, and a stone statue-group carved by John Greenshields in 1830. The panel portrait was bequeathed to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, in 1927 by the artist's great-grandnephew. Taylor also produced a larger version of the portrait, in oils on canvas. Its existence did not come to light until 1893 and was first publicly exhibited in 1895. It was purchased by Captain Wardlaw Ramsay of Whitehill and acquired by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in 1938.<br>
<br>Taylor was also interested in industrial developments and introduced the manufacture of painted waxcloth, &#145;the figuring of linen floorcloth for carpeting&#146;, into Scotland, for which he was awarded a premium of &pound;100 on 13 February 1788 by the board of manufactures &#145;towards the expense incurred by him in erecting the necessary building, machinery, and apparatus for carrying on the work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Literary Journal</span>, 5 Dec 1829). Taylor suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and retired to the south of France where he died at Marseilles on 20 December 1788, leaving his widow and an infant daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
