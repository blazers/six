<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mackintosh,  John</span>  (1868&#150;1920), <span class="occ">confectionery manufacturer</span>, was born in Dukinfield, Cheshire, on 7 July 1868, the son of Joseph Mackintosh, cotton spinner, and his wife, Mary Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burgess. Three months later, Joseph moved to Halifax to become a foreman at the cotton spinners Bowman Brothers, which was managed by his brother, John. Mary Mackintosh, having taught at her own father's school and at the Methodist New Connexion Sunday school, Queen's Road, Halifax, had to undertake the education of her son, John, who at the age of ten began work as a half-timer at Bowman Brothers. Halifax was a stronghold of the small Methodist New Connexion church, and the Mackintoshs were active and founding members of the Queen's Road congregation. By 1881, at the age of thirteen, John Mackintosh was employed full-time on doubling machines, twisting yarn into thread.<br>
<br>In 1890 Mackintosh married a confectioner's assistant and fellow member of his chapel, Violet Taylor, the daughter of a carpet weaver. In the same year they used their joint savings of &pound;100 to open a pastry shop at King Cross Lane, Halifax, Violet running their small enterprise, while John continued to work at the cotton mill. Mackintosh began to search for a speciality which would distinguish his shop and attract custom on the Saturday half-holiday, and Violet developed a recipe which blended the traditional, brittle English butterscotch with caramel, a softer confectionery mainly imported at the time from the USA. They called their new line Mackintosh's Celebrated Toffee, and it was Mackintosh's success that ultimately transformed popular understanding of the term &#145;toffee&#146;, previously a description of any sugar or boiled sweet. When his father died in 1891, aged only forty-eight, Mackintosh had to take responsibility for his mother, five sisters, and a brother, in addition to his wife, but by the middle of the year sales of Celebrated Toffee enabled him to resign from his job at the cotton mill. When new bus routes ceased to carry customers past his house, he responded by setting up a stall at Halifax market, while his wife continued to supervise the shop. By 1894 he had established a trade outside his home town, and he began to rent a small warehouse in Bond Street, Halifax, and, one year later, bigger premises at Hope Street, where he could make his toffee on a larger scale.<br>
<br>The firm was converted into a limited liability company, John Mackintosh Ltd, in 1899. Mackintosh wanted to build a new works at Queen's Road, the site of his Methodist congregation, but could only raise &pound;11,000 of the &pound;15,000 needed. With much difficulty, he persuaded his sceptical bank manager to lend the shortfall, and the company failed to pay dividends for many years. Mackintosh was determined to reinvest his profits, and his expansion plans remained ambitious. In 1909 the Queen's Road factory was burnt down, and Mackintosh used the insurance money of &pound;20,000 to buy the empty Albion Mills. The Queen's Road factory was rebuilt, undertaking the manufacture of chocolate in 1912, and by 1914 John Mackintosh Ltd employed some 1000 people. The scale of Mackintosh's ambition is especially revealed by his overseas activities. In 1904 he began production in a factory at Asbury Park, New Jersey, but the venture soon faltered, causing large financial losses and forcing Mackintosh to restore his fortune. He nevertheless opened a works at Crefeld, near D&uuml;sseldorf, in 1906, later sending his son to Germany in order to learn the language. By 1914 he had also established manufacturing operations in Australia and Canada.<br>
<br>Mackintosh was deeply influenced by his religion and local chapel life. These associations moulded his moral outlook, his charitable gifts, and his belief in the work ethic. He owed his education, his earliest insights into organization, the management of people, and, possibly, advertising to the Methodist New Connexion. His sect encouraged lay leadership, and as a result Mackintosh emerged at an early age as a key figure within his local congregation. In 1884, when fifteen years old, he sat on his chapel's Band of Hope committee. The Sunday school had some 600 members and 60 officers in the 1880s, and Mackintosh served continuously as a staff member for almost thirty years. He was its librarian from 1886 to 1889, its minute secretary from 1889 to 1895, and superintendent from 1895 to 1914. In addition he acted as secretary to the chapel's trustees from 1899 to 1920. Between 1900 and 1909 he was circuit secretary for West Halifax and circuit treasurer from 1909 to 1914, the New Connexion having become part of the United Methodists in 1907. He was a regular delegate to the annual denominational conference, but from 1914 failing health forced him to relinquish his regional and national offices.<br>
<br>Mackintosh was a physically large, modest, and unpretentious man, who never forgot his origins, and his life and emotional commitment revolved around his family, his business, and the Queen's Road chapel. Although he assisted individual members of his congregation financially, he ensured that the chapel remained independent of his wealth. He gained a reputation for his support of local causes. At his factories he exhibited the characteristics of Christian paternalism, and during the First World War he provided &pound;10,000 to the families of employees on active service. He found no calling to public life until his election as a Liberal member of Halifax town council in 1913, and, belatedly, in 1918 he was appointed a borough magistrate.<br>
<br>It was marketing which enabled Mackintosh to establish his toffee as a leading British consumer product. When he first produced his Celebrated Toffee in 1891 he issued handbills, in the same way he would have done to advertise a chapel meeting, and he was soon utilizing newspapers and posters. Through his religious connections he may already have acquired an ease with public speaking and a facility for dealing with people, but he also possessed an innate flair for and understanding of publicity. He emphasized the uniqueness and quality of his toffee, wrapping and selling it in attractive containers. As early as 1896 Mackintosh was calling himself the &#145;Toffee King&#146;. In 1902 he introduced a consumer and coupon competition, the prize being a model cottage worth &pound;250, and he followed this with two scholarships of &pound;30 per annum and with the forwarding of free samples. He came to appreciate the power and advertising value of the popular media, and in 1903 his products began to appear on the front page of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>.<br>
<br>During the First World War the number of employees fell from 1000 to 250, and the German factory was sequestered. In 1917 Mackintosh Ltd developed a line, Toffee-De-Luxe, that was to emerge as its lead product over the next decade, and in 1919 it introduced an employee bonus scheme of &pound;1 for each year of service. By 1920 the company had assets of &pound;350,512. Mackintosh himself was made a director of the Halifax Equitable Bank in 1916, later becoming its vice-chairman as well as vice-chairman of the Equitable Building Society. He was the president of several sports clubs, and had a keen interest in bowling, football, and cricket. When John Mackintosh &amp; Sons Ltd was restructured as a public company in 1921, employee numbers had been restored to their pre-war levels, and output was sixty times the volume achieved in 1899, the year it first became a limited company. Its capital of &pound;750,000 was fully subscribed, with 90 per cent of the ordinary shares controlled by the family. In pursuit of his business interests John Mackintosh was widely travelled, but he continued to live at his modest terraced house in Halifax, the base of his manufacturing operations, and the venue of his religious, charitable, and temperance work. Regarded as unaffected and sympathetic, and as mindful of obligations to his community, he was a man who on several occasions risked his whole fortune to establish a business and one of Britain's most recognizable product lines. He suffered from bad health and died from a heart attack at his house at Greystones, Savile Park, Halifax, on 27 January 1920, aged fifty-one. He was survived by his wife and three sons, the eldest of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34765/', "Harold Vincent Mackintosh")</script>, became chairman of the family firm on his father's death.<br>
