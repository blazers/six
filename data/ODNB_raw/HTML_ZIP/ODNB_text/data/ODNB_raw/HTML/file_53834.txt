<span class="headword">Bannister,  James</span>  (1758/9&#150;1836), <span class="occ">circus proprietor</span>, is of unknown parentage and upbringing. He was one of the earliest circus owners to take his show, Bannister's Equestrian Troupe, on tour. In 1804 they were at Stamford in Lincolnshire for the mid-Lent fair and soon afterwards performed at Grantham with Bannister's daughter, <a href="#cosubject_65481">Miss S. Bannister [<i>see below</i>]</a>, on the tightrope and slack wire. Individually and also in partnership with his fellow equestrian performer, James West, Bannister toured the north of England and Scotland from about 1810; later displays of Bannister's Equestrian Company and Bannister's Olympic circus, an offshoot of Astley's Amphitheatre, appeared at Norwich (1813) and Newcastle and Hull (1815&#150;16). During this period the company employed several prominent performers, among them the equestrians Mr Kemp, Henry Bryson, and James West, and the rider and rope dancer Henry Michael Hengler. In 1816 Bannister employed the artist and later Royal Academician David Roberts (1796&#150;1864) as a scene-painter at his Nicholson Street circus in Edinburgh. Roberts toured with the circus from April 1816, stopping at Carlisle, Newcastle, Hull, and York; in January 1817 Bannister established a new circus and theatre company, the Pantheon, with the musician Montague Corri. Soon afterwards Roberts left the company when his employer was declared bankrupt. Bannister died, aged seventy-seven, on 6 November 1836 and was survived by his two daughters, both of whom worked with their father's companies.<br>
<br>Miss <a name="cosubject_65481"></a><span class="headword">S. Bannister</span>  (<em>b. </em>1787), <span class="occ">equestrian performer and tightrope dancer</span>, was with the equestrian troupe at Stamford in 1804 and in later tours of northern England and Scotland. After her father's business failed she worked at Astley's Amphitheatre, where she was principal equestrian on John Conway Philip Astley's death in October 1821. She remained at the amphitheatre under its new proprietor, William Davis, and was then described by the manager, Charles Dibdin, as possessing &#145;on the rope and on the horse much celebrity&#146;. She married Edward Wilson; details of her date and place of death are unknown. James Bannister's second daughter, <a name="cosubject_65480"></a><span class="headword">Mary Bannister</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1877), <span class="occ">equestrian performer</span>, worked at the Olympic circus in Leeds where, in 1818, she regularly introduced displays of swordsmanship while on horseback; in addition she advertised lessons in the art of riding to ladies by appointment. She later performed for several seasons at Covent Garden, London, and in pantomime with the celebrated tightrope dancer Thomas Wilson, whom she subsequently married before retiring from the circus in 1832. She died in Camberwell, London, on 20 November 1877 and was buried at Norwood cemetery.<br>
