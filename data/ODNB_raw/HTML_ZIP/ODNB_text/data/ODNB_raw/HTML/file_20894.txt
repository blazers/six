<span class="headword">O'Shaughnessy,  William</span>  (1674&#150;1744), <span class="occ">army officer in the French service</span>, son of Roger O'Shaughnessy (<i>d</i>. 1690) and his wife, Helen, daughter of Conor MacDonogh O'Brien of Ballynee, co. Meath, was born in Gort, co. Galway, Ireland, and on the death of his father in July 1690 he became the head of the O'Shaughnessys of Gort. In 1689, aged fifteen, he became captain of foot and afterwards acting colonel in James II's army. He went to France early in 1690 with the regiment of the Irish brigade commanded by Daniel O'Brien, afterwards third Viscount Clare, in which he was appointed captain by Louis XIV on 10 July 1691. He served in Italy in 1692 and was present at the battle of Marsaglia, in Piedmont, in 1693. In 1696 he witnessed the close of the operations at the back of the Alps by the siege of Valenza, where he became commandant of the 3rd battalion of his regiment, and he was appointed to the army of the Meuse.<br>
<br>When the 2nd and 3rd battalions of Clare were re-formed in 1698 O'Shaughnessy was appointed captain of the grenadiers of the battalion which was maintained from 1 April 1698. With his regiment, one of the most famous of the Irish brigade, he served in Germany in the campaigns of 1701&#150;02; he was present at the reduction of Kehl and the first battle of Hochstedt in 1703, and at Blenheim the year after. In 1705 he served with the army of the Moselle. In 1706 he fought at Ramillies, and became major of Clare on 4 July, upon the death of Major John O Carroll, and lieutenant-colonel on 12 September. He served with his regiment in Flanders in 1707, at Oudenarde in 1708, at Malplaquet in 1709, and at the defence of the lines of Arleux, Denain, Douai, Bouchain, and Quesnoy in 1710&#150;12. Subsequently he served in the campaigns in Germany, including the sieges of Landau and Freiberg. He became a brigadier-general on 3 April 1721 and was employed with the army of the Rhine in 1733 and in the campaigns of 1734&#150;5, when he attained the rank of major-general (<i>mar&eacute;chal de camp</i>) on 1 August 1734. He later served with the army in Flanders in 1742, and was in command at Cambray during the campaign of 1743. On 1 November of that year he was appointed to the command at Gravelines, where he died on 2 January 1744, aged seventy, the oldest Irish major-general in French service.<br>
