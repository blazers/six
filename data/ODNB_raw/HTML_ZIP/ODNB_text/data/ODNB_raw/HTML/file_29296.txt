<span class="headword">Whitelaw,  James</span>  (1749&#150;1813), <span class="occ">benefactor and writer</span>, was born in co. Leitrim and educated at Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered in July 1766, becoming a scholar in 1769 and graduating BA in 1771. He studied for the church, and after his ordination became tutor to the earl of Meath, who presented him with the living of St James's, Dublin. Soon after he obtained the more remunerative living of the city's St Catherine's parish. Whitelaw was deeply interested in the condition of the poor who lived in his immediate neighbourhood. His response was the establishment of several charitable institutions, the most useful of which was the Meath charitable loan, founded in 1808, which proved of considerable service to the weavers of the Coombe district during periods of hardship. Due in large part to Whitelaw's efforts, in 1804 the trustees of the Erasmus Smith Fund allocated &pound;2000 for the foundation of a school in the Coombe, at which poor children were given free education. He was subsequently appointed one of the governors of the charter schools of Ireland.<br>
<br>Whitelaw was also an active writer on Dublin life and its history. In 1798 he undertook a census of the city, the results of which he published in his <span class="italic">Essay on the Population of Dublin in 1798</span> (1805). Epidemic diseases were then frequent in Dublin, but, undeterred by the fear of infection, he personally inspected every house in the city and questioned nearly every inhabitant. Hitherto the extent of the population had been a matter of conjecture, with calculations clearly underestimating the level of overcrowding in many dwellings. In one house alone, for example, Whitelaw discovered 108 people. The government ordered the results of his inquiry to be printed, while the original papers were deposited in Dublin Castle. In 1805 he was made one of the members of the commission to examine the conduct of the paving board of Dublin. He received from John Law, bishop of Elphin, the valuable living of Castlereagh, which he was allowed to hold jointly with that of St Catherine's.<br>
<br>Whitelaw's second major publication was the two-volume <span class="italic">History of the City of Dublin</span> (1818), written in collaboration with John Warburton, keeper of the records in Dublin Castle. Both men died before the work was finished, and it was completed by the antiquary Robert Walsh. Whitelaw's other studies are <span class="italic">Parental Solicitude</span> (1800?); <span class="italic">A System of Geography</span>, of which the maps only (engraved by himself) were published; and <span class="italic">An Essay on the Best Method of Ascertaining Areas of Countries of any Considerable Extent</span>, published in the sixth volume of <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy</span>. Whitelaw died in Dublin on 4 February 1813 from a fever contracted while visiting impoverished parishioners. His widow, about whom no further details are known, subsequently received a government pension of &pound;200 p.a.<br>
