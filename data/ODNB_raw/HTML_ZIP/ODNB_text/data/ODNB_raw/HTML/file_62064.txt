<span class="headword">Burney,  Edward Francisco</span>  (1760&#150;1848), <span class="occ">artist</span>, the son of Richard Burney (1723&#150;1792), a dancing-master, and Elizabeth Humphries (<i>c</i>.1720&#150;1771), was born in Worcester on 7 September 1760. He was an accomplished amateur violinist, while his brother Charles Rousseau Burney (1747&#150;1819) was a distinguished if impecunious professional on violin and keyboard. He was the nephew of the music historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4078/', "Dr Charles Burney (1726&#150;1814)")</script> and a favourite cousin of the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/603/', "Frances (Fanny) Burney (1752&#150;1840)")</script>.<br>
<br>Burney enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in 1776, studied there from 1777, lodged with his Burney cousins while there, and left in the 1780s. He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780&#150;1803, showing portraits of family and friends (he was too shy to paint other sitters) and history pieces. (A watercolour drawing of his brother playing the violin is in the National Portrait Gallery, London.) He made good copies after Sir Thomas Lawrence and Sir Joshua Reynolds (for example, the fine <span class="italic">Miss Mary Horneck</span>, ex Sothebys, London, 9 July 1980, lot 114). His best portrait in oils is probably <span class="italic">Fanny Burney</span> (1782; NPG), which uses a bright rococo palette and flat tones to striking effect. He worked chiefly, however, as an illustrator, and exhibited stained drawings for Fanny Burney's <span class="italic">Evelina</span> at the Royal Academy in 1780, in which year he is described as living in York Street, Covent Garden, probably at Gregg's (or Grigg's) Coffee House, which seems to have been part owned by Dr Burney, whose two sisters, Becky (Rebecca) and Nancy (Ann), ran it. Illustrations for <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>, in a manner of controlled reflection of the style of Henry Fuseli, are in the Huntington Library, California, and a pleasant group of drawings, chiefly landscapes, is in Nottingham Castle Museum.<br>
<br>Burney's most original works are four remarkable large-scale watercolour compositions of a sharply satirical nature: <span class="italic">The Waltz</span> and <span class="italic">The Elegant Establishment for Young Ladies</span> (V&amp;A), and <span class="italic">Amateurs of Tye-Wig Music</span> and <span class="italic">The Glee Club, or, The Triumph of Music</span> (Yale U. CBA). A version in oil of <span class="italic">Amateurs of Tye-Wig Music</span> (<i>c</i>.1820; Tate collection) with the particular theme of modern versus traditional taste in music, is painted with verve and precision, and the group suggests that Burney had formed plans to develop his satires and their publication along the lines pioneered by Hogarth. Burney relies upon caricature to a degree which Hogarth would never have allowed, although his targets&#151;society in general and musical life in particular&#151;are similar. Burney exploits an extravagantly swooping line that lends his works a distinctive edge. For whatever reason, the other compositions in this group appear not to have been painted, and none was published as an engraving.<br>
<br>Another group of drawings now firmly attributed to Burney (BM, 1904-1-1-1 ff.) shows the hang of the Royal Academy exhibition in 1784, and the pictures thus predate the famous 1787 illustration by J. H. Ramberg, to whom these drawings were previously given. Another important record of contemporary life is Burney's drawing of De Loutherbourg's famous Eidophusikon (1782; BM). Even slight sketches by Burney can provide rare insights, and <span class="italic">A Tragic Actress</span> (Tate collection) reveals more than many verbal records about contemporary theatrical style. Burney died in London on 16 December 1848; he was unmarried.<br>
