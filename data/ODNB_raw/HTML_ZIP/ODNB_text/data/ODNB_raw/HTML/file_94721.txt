<span class="headword">Weld <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Slaney]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Weld  (<em>bap. </em>1560?, <em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">benefactor and patron of ministers</span>, was one of at least four surviving children of Sir Stephen Slaney (1524&#150;1608), merchant of London and lord mayor, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1618), daughter of Jasper Fesant or Phesaunt of Tottenham, Middlesex. She was probably the Mary Slaney, daughter of Stephen, baptized at St Mary Colechurch on 20 November 1560. Mary's first husband was Richard Bradgate, a member of her father's livery company, the Skinners, and a resident of Ironmonger Lane, off Cheapside. On his death in 1589 Mary received an annuity of &pound;60 and the residue of his estate. She remarried shortly afterwards, probably the following year, her second husband being <a name="cosubject_94721"></a><span class="headword">Sir Humphrey Weld</span>  (1547&#150;1610), widower of Anne Stapers and a prosperous <span class="occ">member of the Grocers' Company</span>, and moved to his house in Allhallows Honey Lane, by the Standard in Cheapside. Surprisingly little is known of Humphrey Weld's business activities. Although he invested in the Virginia Company in the last year of his life, he was never active in overseas trade, and he may have made his fortune in retailing silk (he left money for loans to members of the Grocers' Company trading as silkmen). Weld achieved high civic honours, elected alderman in 1598, serving as sheriff in 1599&#150;1600, and lord mayor in 1608&#150;9; he was knighted on 26 July 1603. On his death on 29 November 1610 he left Mary her jewellery, the plate she had brought to the marriage, and all his household goods in London not otherwise bequeathed, but, more significantly, also the residue of his estate and (so long as she remained unmarried) the handsome mansion house in St Olave Jewry to which they had moved in 1608 in anticipation of his mayoralty.<br>
<br>Like most women, even of this class, Mary's role in the marriage remains shadowy, but, being childless, she probably concentrated her efforts on raising Humphrey's young children from his first marriage, on support for the godly causes her husband also espoused, and on the consolidation of her formidable network of kin, many of them also counted among the godly. Her sister Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1632) married Samuel Lennard (<i>d</i>. 1618) of West Wickham, Kent, and her sister Anne (<i>d</i>. 1602) was the wife of another gentleman, Thomas Colepeper (<i>d</i>. 1613), and mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5876/', "John Colepeper, first Baron Colepeper")</script>. Her stepson, Sir John Weld (1582&#150;1623) was married to Frances Whitmore (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of William Whitmore, haberdasher, and sister to the future lord mayor, Sir George Whitmore (<i>b</i>. after 1572, <i>d</i>. 1654). Her stepdaughters married into the gentry, Joanne (<i>bap</i>. 1579, <i>d</i>. 1618) to Sir Robert Brooke (<i>d</i>. 1646) of Cockfield, Suffolk, and Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1584) successively to Richard Corbet of Stoke upon Tern, Shropshire, and (in 1617) to Sir James Stonehouse (<i>d</i>. 1638) of Islington. In a striking godly match, in 1620 Brooke married as his second wife Dame Mary's niece Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3539/', "Brooke, Elizabeth (1602?&#150;1683)")</script>] and the couple lodged with Dame Mary for the first two years of their marriage. Brooke had been educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was a leading patron of godly clergy, while his wife displayed exemplary piety. Brooke was to act as executor to Dame Mary, alongside her cousin, the rising city lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22095/', "Peter Phesant")</script>, and William Litton (married to another niece, Anne Slaney, daughter of her brother Stephen). The Lennards likewise made a formidable godly couple. Samuel's will displays a hatred of popery verging on the pathological, and his wife was to be closely associated with Mary in the establishment of her charities. Mary and Elizabeth shared the dedication of an improving spiritual tract by the radical puritan Paul Baynes, seen through the press by Ezekiel Charke: &#145;As you are sisters in nature, so you are nearer sisters in grace&#146;  (Baynes, <span class="italic">Christian Letters</span>, sig. C4).<br>
<br>Mary Weld is usually remembered as the benefactor behind an endowment of &pound;2000 to buy up impropriations, guaranteeing ministers better support with a view to improving standards of clerical provision. Less well appreciated is the fact that the charity had been anticipated a few years previously by a similar bequest by her mother, Dame Margaret Slaney. Mary Weld and Elizabeth Lennard may well have been the moving force behind their mother's charity, acting as her executors, but they in turn were doubtless influenced by Dame Mary's &#145;loving friend&#146;, Alderman Rowland Heylyn, a leading force among the feoffees for impropriations, and by others in the godly network with whom the sisters were closely associated. The establishment of the charity was not straightforward, however: the Grocers (preferred as trustee over the Skinners), accepting it &#145;soe farre as the lawes of this land will permitt and learned counsell can devyse&#146;  (GL, MS 11588/3, fol. 124), took legal advice from the solicitor-general, Sir Thomas Coventry, and the apparently indispensable Peter Phesant. Difficulties had been anticipated, for Lady Slaney herself had requested that the bequest be confirmed by act of parliament (which never happened, though the Grocers made enquiries about the prospects of doing this in 1621), but there were also tensions between the Grocers and the formidable widows who themselves chose the first impropriation (Norhill in Buckinghamshire) to be purchased, without anticipating the difficulties that would almost immediately arise because of the lack of a farmer to collect the tithes. Perhaps this explains why Dame Mary's own bequest for the same purpose was vested with the Merchant Taylors' Company. Mary's gift was more carefully crafted than her mother's. But the doubts were such that the Merchant Taylors declined (on a ballot after several months' deliberation in July 1624) to accept it, and in the event the charity was taken on by the Haberdashers (assisted by her kinsmen Sir George Whitmore and Humphrey Slaney) the following year. Further difficulties with the executors delayed their receipt of the bequest until 1630.<br>
<br>The benefaction for impropriations was the most substantial legacy in a will which left a total of &pound;5470 for charitable purposes. Lady Weld supported scholars &#145;applicable to learninge and addicted to the studdy of divinyty&#146; at Trinity College, Cambridge, with &pound;500  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/141, fol. 130<i>v</i>); another &pound;500 went to Christ's Hospital, &pound;200 to the release of poor debtors, and &pound;300 in loan stocks to the Merchant Taylors and Skinners (the Grocers significantly got nothing beyond &pound;20 for a funeral dinner); she left &pound;300 for the support of a divinity lecture in St Olave Jewry, &pound;120 for the St Antholin's lectures, and &pound;200 for the support of the minister in the Lennards' parish of West Wickham to ensure that the population were catechized (&#145;whereby they may learne to knowe God and their dutyes towardes him and their superiors&#146;; ibid.), and &pound;100 to the chapel erected by her husband at Arnold's Southgate. No less than &pound;1000 was made available to support &#145;godly painfull and poor zealous preachers in want&#146;  (ibid.): among those she wished to see supported was Daniel Rogers, the lecturer at Weathersfield. Such charitable largess did not imply the neglect of her kin, to whom cash bequests amounting to about &pound;5000 were left. The main beneficiaries were her nephews and nieces, particularly John Colepeper, Elizabeth Brooke, Anne Litton (her brother Stephen's daughter) and her daughters, and the children of Samuel and Elizabeth Lennard. It is noteworthy that the bequests to Anne Litton and Elizabeth Brooke were made conditional on their husbands making more favourable arrangements for their jointures. The will also makes it clear that Dame Mary lived in some comfort: one of its most extraordinary features is the itemization of the contents of each of the St Olave Jewry house's main rooms&#151;the great chamber, the best lodging chamber, the great parlour, and late Mr Corbet's chamber&#151;the beds and their accoutrements, the tapestries, carpets, and table linen, and her plate and jewellery are carefully listed. Her coach was destined for her sister, Elizabeth Lennard. Her godly sensibilities were evidently not incompatible with the conventions of social display, also evident in the provision for a funeral costing &pound;1200, rivalling aristocratic funerals in its magnificence. Mary Weld died on 26 April 1623 and was buried on 27 May at St Olave Jewry in the vault alongside her husband.<br>
