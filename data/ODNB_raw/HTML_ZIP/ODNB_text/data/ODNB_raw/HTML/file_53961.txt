<span class="headword">Mantell,  Reginald Neville</span>  (1827&#150;1857), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born in Lewes on 11 August 1827, the youngest, somewhat uncontrollable child of the surgeon <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18004/', "Gideon Algernon Mantell (1790&#150;1852)")</script> and his wife, Mary Ann Woodhouse (1795&#150;1869). His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53960/', "Walter Baldock Durrant Mantell (1820&#150;1895)")</script>. After desultory schooling at Lewes, Hanwell, and Clapham up to 1842, Mantell received valuable practical experience in civil engineering under Henry Carr in 1843. On 27 May 1844 he was formally apprenticed (at a cost to his father of &pound;800) to Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Mantell worked on Hungerford Bridge (over the Thames at London) and, more importantly, on branches of the Great Western Railway. Living successively at Trowbridge and Swindon, he socialized extensively and collected fossils from newly made rail cuts in his spare time. These fossils were at first sent to his father, but Mantell later published on others himself. His finds, mostly interpreted by others, substantially resolved an important controversy regarding belemnites, confirming the identity of <i>Belemnoteuthis</i> as an independent genus separate from <i>Belemnites</i>.<br>
<br>Brunel was so pleased with the quality of Mantell's work as an engineer that in 1847 he cancelled the last year of Mantell's indentures and paid him a salary instead. Nationwide economic decline prevented Mantell from achieving a permanent position, but in March 1849 he rode aboard several of Brunel's new (and decidedly unsafe) locomotives on a frightful series of test runs to ascertain their consumption of coke and water. Rescued from that dangerous occupation by parental generosity, Mantell toured America later the same year at his father's expense. After some further months in England, he returned to the United States in August 1850 to accept employment as a railway engineer in and around Paris, Kentucky, a frequently violent frontier town that left its imprint on him.<br>
<br>Forced back to England by his father's death on 10 November 1852, Mantell oversaw the disbursement of his estate, returned briefly to Henry Carr, and then accepted a four-year position as district engineer in Allahabad, India. However, he proved unable to get along with the Hindus; he was successfully sued by one for battery and twice had his professional responsibilities curtailed as a result. In India he devoted his spare time to photography, the techniques of which he had learned in England from the well-known American photographer John Mayall.<br>
<br>Caught up in the Sepoy mutiny, Mantell died (unmarried) of cholera on 30 June 1857 in his houseboat on the Jumna River at Allahabad. He was buried in Allahabad the same day, his effects being eventually returned to his brother Walter in England. Gideon Mantell's <span class="italic">Thoughts on a Pebble</span> (1836; eight editions), a popular introduction to geology, was written for Reginald and dedicated to him.<br>
