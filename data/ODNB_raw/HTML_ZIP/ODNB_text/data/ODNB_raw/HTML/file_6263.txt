<span class="headword">Copland,  James</span>  (1791&#150;1870), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in November 1791 in the Orkney Isles. The eldest of nine children, he went to school at Lerwick, and in November 1807 entered the University of Edinburgh. His studies were at first directed towards theology, but after a time he changed to medicine, and graduated MD in 1815. He went to London in August of that year, and spent eighteen months going round the London hospitals, to study the surgical practices. Being offered an appointment as medical officer to the settlements of the Royal African Company, he sailed early in 1817 for the French trading fort of Goree, and then continued to Senegal, the Gambia, and Sierra Leone, learning all he could of the diseases of the country. Soon after leaving Sierra Leone he was able to make use of his newly acquired knowledge, for three-quarters of the crew fell ill with fever, and in the midst of the epidemic a gale carried away the masts of the ship. Following the storm Copland landed and by various means made his way along the coast to the British fort of Cape Coast, where he lived for some months; he returned to England in 1818. He then travelled through France and Germany, again looking at medical practice, and was back in England by 1820. In the same year he took a house at Walworth and became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. He wrote on the medical topography of west Africa for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Foreign Medicine</span> (1820), on human rumination, on yellow fever, on hydrophobia, and on cholera for the <span class="italic">London Medical Repository</span> (1821); he then engaged in a discussion on chronic peritonitis in the <span class="italic">London Medical and Physical Journal</span>, about whether the disease was caused by tubercle or merely by chronic inflammation.<br>
<br>In 1822 Copland took a house in Jermyn Street and became editor of the <span class="italic">London Medical Repository</span>, to which he also continued to contribute. In 1825 he issued a prospectus for an encyclopaedia of medicine. At the same time he lectured on medicine at a medical school then existing in Little Dean Street; somewhat later he took up a similar post at the Middlesex Hospital. His further proposals for an encyclopaedia were ultimately successful; the first part was issued in 1832, and Copland's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Practical Medicine</span>, in three volumes, and covering every part of medicine, was completed in 1858. It earned him &pound;4000. The advances in medical techniques had been so great that the publishers then urged him to prepare a supplement, for which he was paid &pound;1000. His achievement earned Copland the epithet of &#145;the Johnson of medicine&#146;  (Clarke, 410), whom, it was said, he to some degree resembled  (ibid., 420).<br>
<br>In 1832, following an outbreak of cholera in Britain, Copland's earlier article on cholera was published as a separate book, <span class="italic">Pestilential Cholera, its Nature, Prevention, and Curative Treatment</span>; cholera was a disease which Copland believed to be spread by contagion. Copland was elected FRS in 1833, and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1837. He built up a considerable practice and wrote more on medicine than any fellow of the college, in his own day or previously. He was respected in the college and was Croonian lecturer in 1844, 1845, and 1846; Lumleian lecturer in 1854 and 1855, and Harveian orator in 1857. He was president of the Pathological Society, but did not obtain the respect of the practical morbid anatomists who attended its meetings, and who were often led to smile when the president claimed as his own numerous modern discoveries in pathology. Copland gave up practice about a year before his death. He died at Hertford House, Brondesbury Road, Kilburn, London, on 12 July 1870. Nothing is known of his wife, but a son and a daughter were named as executors to his will.<br>
