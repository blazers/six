<span class="headword">Wagstaffe, Sir  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611?, <em>d.</em> 1666/7), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was probably baptized on 13 August 1611 at Harbury, Warwickshire, and was probably the seventh and youngest son of Richard Wagstaffe (<i>b</i>. 1574) of Harbury, and his wife, Anne, daughter of John Hanslap of Stonythorpe in the same county. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28400/', "Thomas Wagstaffe")</script> the nonjuror and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28402/', "William Wagstaffe")</script>, physician, were relatives of Joseph Wagstaffe.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe's early life is obscure, but at the beginning of 1642 he was a major in an Irish regiment in the service of France. In June 1642 he became lieutenant-colonel in the army destined by the parliament for the recovery of Ireland, and in the following autumn he held the same rank in John Hampden's regiment of foot in the earl of Essex's army. Taken prisoner by the royalists in January 1643, he changed sides and accepted a commission to raise a regiment for the king. He was wounded at the recapture of Lichfield Close by Prince Rupert's forces in the spring of 1643. Subsequently he was major-general of foot under Prince Maurice in the west of England, was knighted at Crediton on 27 or 28 July 1644, and distinguished himself by his soldierly retreat in the disastrous battle of Langport. In September 1648 he was placed under arrest on suspicion of plotting an uprising, but he escaped from confinement at Peterhouse prison, London, almost as soon as he arrived. At some point thereafter he fled to the continent.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe returned in 1655 when the western royalists asked for him to be their leader in their part of an intended national rising against Cromwell, he being well known to them and generally beloved. Clarendon characterizes him as fitted:<blockquote>rather for execution than counsel, a stout man who looked not far before him, yet he had a great companionableness in his nature, which exceedingly prevailed with those who in the intermission of fighting loved to spend their time in jollity and mirth.</blockquote>Despite the collapse of the conspiracy in other parts of the country on 8 March, Wagstaffe, with about 200 Wiltshire royalists, optimistic expectations of nationwide insurrection, and assistance from France, entered Salisbury early on 12 March 1655, and proclaimed Charles II.<br>
<br>The judges on circuit and sheriff were seized in their beds, and Wagstaffe thought of hanging them as a seasonable example, but was prevented by the opposition of Colonel Penruddock and the country gentlemen. After leaving Salisbury with about 400 men, the royalists marched into Dorset, but gained few recruits on their way. When they entered Somerset their numbers began to diminish, and the few who remained were taken or dispersed by Captain Unton Croke at South Molton on the night of 14 March. Wagstaffe himself escaped all the searches made after him, and was back in Flanders by July. He survived the Restoration, petitioned for the reversion of an office which he did not obtain, and received a small grant of some of the late king's goods in 1662. He died between July 1666, when his will (which makes no mention of a wife or children) was written, and 12 February 1667, when it was proved. His place of burial is unknown.<br>
