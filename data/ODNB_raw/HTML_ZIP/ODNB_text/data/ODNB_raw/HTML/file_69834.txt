<span class="headword">Hutchins,  Elizabeth Leigh</span>  (1858&#150;1935), <span class="occ">social investigator and socialist</span>, was born on 20 April 1858 at 25 Hanover Square, London, the daughter of Frederick Leigh Hutchins, a solicitor, and his wife, Emily Every. Little is known about her early years. Privately educated, she later attended King's College for Women in London and in 1896 became a student at the new London School of Economics, where she was taught by Beatrice Webb.<br>
<br>Remaining in London, she joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96080', "Women's Industrial Council")</script> in 1899, became a member of its executive committee by 1904, and served as the editor of its journal, the <span class="italic">Women's Industrial News</span>. She was a member of the Fabian Society, serving on its executive committee between 1907 and 1912, and a founder member of the Fabian Women's Group in 1908.<br>
<br>A prolific researcher, investigator, and author, Hutchins published at least twenty works between 1901 and 1917. Her meticulously researched works contain a wealth of statistics and information on the conditions of women's work, their wages, and the history of labour laws affecting them. Her book <span class="italic">A History of Factory Legislation</span> (1903), co-written with Amy Harrison, provided detailed information about the development of factory regulations from their inception until 1901 and covered the campaigns for shorter hours, the extension of legislation to workshops, the creation of measures to safeguard the health and safety of workers, and special regulations for women. Hutchins viewed protective labour legislation as progressive reforms that reflected the state's responsibilities towards its female workers. This perspective led her to criticize middle-class &#145;women's rights&#146; groups, as she called them, whose individualism led them to argue that protection violated women's freedom in the workplace. As a result she participated in the contemporary debate among women's organizations about the effects of protection on women workers. In his preface to this work, Sidney Webb praised it for being the first systematic treatment of the subject. By the time of Hutchins's death it was considered the standard work on factory legislation, and it has been routinely cited by historians ever since.<br>
<br>Many of Hutchins's other publications dealt with the contemporary issues of women's home work and sweated labour. She contributed an article about a sweated industries exhibition held in Berlin in 1905 to the handbook for the Sweated Industries Exhibition held in London in 1906, an event intended to bring sweated labour to public and governmental attention. Her Fabian tract, <span class="italic">Home Work and Sweating: the Causes and the Remedies</span>, appeared in 1907. She also contributed to the Women's Industrial Council's investigation of home work, <span class="italic">Home Industries of Women in London</span> (1908), the sections that examined legislative initiatives regarding home work in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. She supported the creation of minimum wage legislation for sweated trades.<br>
<br>In 1907 and 1908 Hutchins delivered a series of lectures on women's work and public health. When the Women's Industrial Council offered a course at King's College entitled &#145;The relation of the state to women's work&#146;, in 1907 Hutchins lectured on the history of legislation affecting women in trade and industry. In the following year she presented four lectures at the London School of Economics on the nineteenth-century public health movement. The latter lectures were published in 1909 as <span class="italic">The Public Health Agitation, 1833&#150;1848</span>.<br>
<br>During the pre-war years Hutchins was part of a wide network of social reformers actively working to improve the conditions of women's work. Her activities and writings brought her into contact with the Webbs, Margaret and Ramsay MacDonald, Clementina Black of the Women's Industrial Council, J. J. Mallon of the Anti-Sweating League, and Mary MacArthur of the Women's Trade Union League.<br>
<br>Hutchins's career as a social investigator and writer ended with <span class="italic">Women in Industry after the War</span> (1917). Thereafter she turned her attention and support towards the League of Nations, on whose committee she served. Formerly of Holland Park, London, Hutchins died at her home, 6 Granville Court, Granville Road, Eastbourne, on 17 October 1935. She had previously established a scholarship at the London School of Economics and provided for its permanent maintenance.<br>
<br>Hutchins's obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> characterized her as an accomplished woman with a wide circle of friends. She was a talented linguist and musician who enjoyed concerts, plays, and country walks. Friends and relatives described Bessie, as she liked to be called, as a woman who lived an unselfish life of private and civic service. Hutchins epitomizes the highly educated &#145;new woman&#146; of the period who did not marry, but rather directed and devoted her immense energies and talents to a cause: the cause of working women.<br>
