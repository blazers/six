<span class="headword">Sheridan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Chamberlaine]</span>,  Frances</span>  (1724&#150;1766), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born in Dublin, the daughter of the Revd Dr Philip Chamberlaine, prebendary of Rathmichael, archdeacon of Glendalough, and rector of St Nicholas Without, and his wife, Anastasia Whyte. Frances was the youngest of five children, three of whom were boys; her mother died shortly after her birth. Her father considering female literacy &#145;perfectly superfluous&#146;, Frances Chamberlaine was secretly taught to write by her clergyman brother Walter. At the age of fifteen, she wrote a romance, <span class="italic">Eugenia and Adelaide</span>, published posthumously in 1791, and two sermons which her granddaughter recorded &#145;were reckoned to display considerable ability&#146;  (A. Le Fanu, 9).<br>
<br>During the so-called <span class="italic">Cato</span> affair (a theatrical quarrel sparked off by the misappropriation of a costume) in Dublin in 1743, Frances Chamberlaine espoused the side of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25371/', "Thomas Sheridan (1719?&#150;1788)")</script>, of the Smock Alley Theatre, penning in his defence some verses entitled &#145;The Owls: a Fable&#146;. She subsequently married the actor and theatre manager, probably in 1747. The couple had six children: Thomas (who died aged three), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25363/', "Charles Francis Sheridan")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "Richard Brinsley Sheridan")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16335/', "Alicia, later Alicia Le Fanu (1753&#150;1817)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16339/', "Le Fanu, Philip (1735&#150;1795)")</script>], Sackville (who died in infancy), and Anne Elizabeth.<br>
<br>As a consequence of financial misfortunes, the Sheridans moved to London in 1754. There, Frances Sheridan met Samuel Richardson who read her unpublished romance and encouraged her to write another. The result was her finest work, the sentimental novel <span class="italic">Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph</span>, published anonymously, but with a dedication to Richardson, in 1761. A study of the effect of extreme distress on apparently irreproachable virtue, the novel embodies a feminist critique of poetical justice so remorseless as to lead Samuel Johnson, one of many influential admirers, to exclaim, &#145;I know not, Madam, that you have a right, upon moral principles, to make your readers suffer so much&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 276). As one whose own writing was influenced by contemporary French fiction, Sheridan received the compliment of finding <span class="italic">Sidney Bidulph</span> translated into French by the Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost as <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire de la vertu</span> in 1761; a German translation appeared the following year.<br>
<br>Sheridan next turned from fiction to the theatre, writing a comedy, <span class="italic">The Discovery</span> (1763), which pleased David Garrick, who staged it at Drury Lane on 3 February 1763, playing the role of Sir Anthony Branville himself with Thomas Sheridan taking the part of Lord Medway. The young John O'Keeffe declared that the comedy &#145;gave great delight, and the success was perfect&#146;  (O'Keeffe, 1.86). It played to full houses for seventeen nights; subsequent revivals included an adaptation by Aldous Huxley in 1924. On 10 December of the same year, a second comedy, <span class="italic">The Dupe</span> (published 1764), was produced at Drury Lane by George Colman before being withdrawn after three nights, allegedly because &#145;of the theatrical cabals of a popular actress [Kitty Clive]&#146;  (A. Le Fanu, 235&#150;6).<br>
<br>In general Frances Sheridan was much admired by male and female friends alike: from Samuel Johnson, Edward Young, and James Boswell&#151;who considered her &#145;sensible, ingenious, unassuming, yet communicative&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 275)&#151;to Sarah Fielding, Catherine Macauley, and Sarah Scott. The Sheridans' continuing financial difficulties constrained them in September 1764 to move to France, where they eventually settled at Blois. There Sheridan wrote the <span class="italic">Conclusion of the Memoirs of Miss Sidney Bidulph</span>, relating the misfortunes of her heroine's daughters (1767). An unfinished comedy, <span class="italic">A Journey to Bath</span>, was rejected by Garrick, and eventually published only in 1890. A completion by Elizabeth Kuti was successfully staged in Ireland and Edinburgh in 1999. The play is notable for providing in Mrs Tryfort the prototype of Mrs Malaprop in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> by Frances's son Richard Brinsley Sheridan.<br>
<br>Frances Sheridan's final (and posthumously published) work, <span class="italic">The History of Nourjahad</span> (1767), confirmed her talents as a writer of fiction; another account of virtue under stress and long regarded as the finest oriental tale in English after Johnson's <span class="italic">Rasselas</span>, the work went through many editions and translation into French, Russian, and Polish and was dramatized by Sophia Lee (1788), among others. Frances Sheridan died at Blois after a short illness on 26 September 1766. She was survived by her husband.<br>
