<span class="headword">Yeamans <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fell]</span>,  Isabel</span>  (1637<span class="mult">x</span>42&#150;1704), <span class="occ">Quaker preacher</span>, was born at Swarthmoor Hall, near Ulverston, Lancashire, the third of eight children (seven sisters and one brother) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9262/', "Thomas Fell (bap. 1599, d. 1658)")</script>, judge and recruiter MP for Lancaster, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9260/', "Margaret Fell (1614&#150;1702)")</script>, daughter of the Lancashire gentleman John Askew of Marsh Grange near Dalton in Furness. She became deeply committed to Quakerism in 1652, when George Fox first visited Swarthmoor Hall and converted Margaret Fell and her daughters to the new sect. By 1660 Isabel became an intermittently travelling Quaker. She was known to preach throughout her adult life at the meetings she visited across England. Her signature appeared on Quaker women's meeting records from Yorkshire to Somerset between the 1670s and the 1690s, and she corresponded with other Quaker ministers such as William Penn.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1664 Isabel Fell married William Yeamans (1639&#150;1674), a Quaker and merchant of Bristol. They had at least four children, three of whom died in childhood. When her mother married George Fox in Bristol in 1669 Isabel was present and signed the marriage certificate. During her married years in Bristol she helped set up the Bristol women's monthly meeting in 1671 in response to George Fox's circular letter sent out to encourage women to form separate women's meetings for business, which pronounced that men and women were &#145;helpmeets&#146; for one another, and also in the wake of her mother's earlier call for women's rights in Quaker meetings in <span class="italic">Women's Speaking Justified</span> (1666). The efforts of Isabel Yeamans and the Bristol women challenged the Bristol leadership and they did meet resistance. The (all-male) Bristol two-week meeting admonished the women for exceeding the boundaries of authority in forming their own meeting without their approval. The Bristol women acquiesced.<br>
<br>William Yeamans died in 1674, after which Isabel returned to Swarthmoor and lived there for some time with her two surviving children, William and Rachel (an earlier William had died in 1666 and Margaret in 1674). While there she attended the women's monthly meetings. In June 1676 Rachel died at Swarthmoor, aged ten. A small note in the household account book of Isabel's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69081/', "Sarah Fell")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9260/', "Fell, Margaret")</script>] of Swarthmoor, marks her passing, for 5<i>s</i>. was paid to a friend for &#145;her paines about Rachel Yeamans when she died&#146;  (Fell, <span class="italic">Household Account Book</span>, 285).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1677 Isabel Yeamans accompanied George Fox, William Penn, George Keith, and Robert Barclay to the Netherlands and then to northern Germany to visit small groups of Quakers living in the region, and in the hope of converting protestant sectaries to the Quaker &#145;Truth&#146;, as early Quakers termed it. The party visited Princess Elizabeth of the Palatinate, a learned woman who had shown some interest in Quaker thought in her earlier correspondence with Penn. Accompanied by Penn and Barclay, Isabel did speak during the visit with Princess Elizabeth, who was somewhat taken by her free manner of personal delivery. Fox did not attend the meeting, but rather wrote a letter which was personally delivered by Isabel to Princess Elizabeth. Fox was then fifty-three years old, and it is probable that his wife, Margaret, was concerned for his position in the Quaker leadership. Isabel Yeamans was chosen to accompany her stepfather in part for her reputation as an effective preacher, but she also acted as a support and representative for him in relation to the other influential Quaker travellers of higher social status. By the late 1670s Fox was yielding his <i>primus inter pares</i> leadership role to younger men, some of whom were of higher social rank.<br>
<br>Over her adult years Yeamans kept close contact with her mother and sisters. The Fell women exchanged continuous correspondence, purchased needed articles for one another when in London, and exchanged gifts and advice. The family correspondence between 1652 and 1704 resonates with affection, generosity, mutual concern, and an insatiable desire for news of one another. In 1689 Yeamans married Abraham Morrice of Lincoln, a well-to-do merchant who was an active Quaker in his monthly meeting in the south-west area of Lincolnshire. Both died in 1704, presumably at their home in Lincoln. The value of the Morrice estate is unknown.<br>
