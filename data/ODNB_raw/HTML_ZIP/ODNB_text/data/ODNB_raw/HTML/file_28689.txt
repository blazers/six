<span class="headword">Ward,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1590, <em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">composer and administrator</span>, was baptized on 15 February 1590 at St Mary Bredman, Canterbury. His parents are not named in the baptismal record, but a visitation pedigree dated 1634 names his father as John Ward of Canterbury, son of William Ward of Yorkshire. His mother was Susan, daughter of Thomas Dunkin of Canterbury  (Metcalfe, 518). This document, when checked against local baptismal records, may imply that John Ward senior was a singing man at Canterbury Cathedral, most probably the minor canon of that name who died in 1617. Another theory, however, is that the composer's father was a domestic servant of Elizabeth Smyth of Ashford and Westhanger who married, about 1594, Sir Henry Fanshawe of Ware Park, Hertfordshire, remembrancer of the exchequer and a patron of the arts. According to this theory, two John Wards served the Fanshawes, father (from before about 1594 until his death probably between February and August 1630), and son (the composer, from about 1607 until his death in 1638); but if the composer's father was indeed the cathedral singing man, then all references to the domestic servant must be taken to apply to the composer.<br>
<br>Ward the composer was a chorister at the cathedral from 1597 to 1604 and a king's scholar at the grammar school in Canterbury from 1604 to 1607. He subsequently joined Sir Henry Fanshawe's flourishing musical establishment; in his <span class="italic">First Set of English Madrigals</span> (1613) he addresses Sir Henry as &#145;my very good Maister&#146; and claims that the contents are &#145;the primitiae of my Muse, planted in your pleasure, and cherisht by &hellip; your favour&#146;  (p. xv).<br>
<br>This work has until recently been the chief foundation of Ward's fame. Its contents proclaim him to be a very important figure among the English school of madrigalists who drew inspiration from contemporaries such as John Wilbye, George Kirbye, and Thomas Weelkes; his six-part works in particular have been praised for their musical quality. Other works of this type, unpublished in his lifetime, include elegies on the deaths of Henry, prince of Wales (1612) and of Fanshawe (1616), while the gap between sacred and secular, and vocal and instrumental music is filled by a small number of attractive consort songs (for voices and viols in parts ranging from three to six) set to colourful sacred texts and intended for domestic use. As a composer with important contacts at court (through his patron) Ward was widely respected by his contemporaries. This is reflected in the number of his works that occur in contemporary manuscripts and prints; these include two short contributions to Sir William Leighton's <span class="italic">Tears or Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soul</span> (1614) and an evening service setting and two anthems of outstanding quality included in John Barnard's <span class="italic">First Book of Selected Church Music</span> (1641).<br>
<br>When Fanshawe drew up his will in 1613 it was witnessed by John Ward, probably the composer's father but possibly the composer himself. Following Sir Henry's death in 1616 his son and successor in the remembrancership, Sir Thomas Fanshawe, gave less support to the family's musical establishment and it was probably about this time (and certainly by April 1621) that Ward obtained a modest post in the remembrancer's office. As an attorney or subordinate substitute for Sir Thomas in minor exchequer business he was thereafter desk-bound in London for much of his time. In 1619 Sir Thomas arranged for John Ward, gentleman (more likely the composer's father), to receive a grant from the king of the arrears owing to the crown on a yearly sum of &pound;8 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. out of the Fanshawes' manor of Bengeo, Hertfordshire. Two years later a Mr John Ward, &#145;servant of Sir Thomas Fanshawe&#146;, authorized to collect his patron's salary on the latter's behalf  (BL, Add. MS 41578, fol. 101<i>r</i>) was probably the composer. However, the John Ward named as a trustee in a settlement by Elizabeth Fanshawe on 21 May 1629 of her manor of Dengey, Essex, was more likely to have been her servant, Ward senior; her will of 20 February 1630 was witnessed by John Ward, gentleman, referred to as the testatrix's &#145;auncient servant&#146;.<br>
<br>Ward the composer married Thomasine, daughter of Thomas Clee of London, &#145;dwelling nere the Tower dock&#146;  (<span class="italic">Visitations of Essex</span>, 518), about 1625 and they at first probably lived in the Fanshawes' Warwick Lane mansion. However, it was at Barking, Essex, that their fifth child, Mary, apparently was baptized in August 1630 and buried on 2 January 1633. This suggests that John Ward senior, who had built up a modest estate at Great Ilford, a village in Barking parish, had recently died and that the composer and his wife had moved their household from Warwick Lane to Ilford. According to the terms of the Dengey trust deed of 1629 the place of each trustee would be taken at his death by his heir, and &#145;Johannes Ward generous&#146; (presumably the composer) appears as a &#145;farmer&#146; of the manor in surviving court rolls dated 1632, 1634, and 1636. Ward was still at his post in the remembrancer's office in May 1638 but died that summer; his will, made on 1 April 1634, was proved on 31 August 1638.<br>
