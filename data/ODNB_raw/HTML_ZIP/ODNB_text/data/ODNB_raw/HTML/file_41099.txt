<span class="headword">Sosnow,  Eric Charles</span>  (1910&#150;1987), <span class="occ">journalist and businessman</span>, was born on 18 August 1910 in Kolno, eastern Poland, the second son in the family of three boys and two girls of David Sosnow, a Jewish produce merchant, and his wife, Libby Markewitz. He spent his early years in Poland and was educated at &#321;omza secondary school, Vilna University, and law chambers in Warsaw. In 1934 he left Poland for England and was employed as a foreign correspondent for Polish newspapers.<br>
<br>Sosnow worked briefly for Nahum Sokolov as his private secretary. In 1936 he became a graduate research student at the London School of Economics. As a foreign journalist he joined the Foreign Press Association and with his knowledge of politics and command of languages (he spoke eight) he specialized in articles on eastern Europe. In 1938 he started writing for <span class="italic">The Economist</span> under Donald Tyerman and in 1940 became an overseas correspondent for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Chronicle</span>. He was to continue writing for these papers for a further twenty years. His reputation grew and in 1944 he was asked to interview the Polish prime minister and, later, the president of Czechoslovakia before the latter's ill-fated journey to Moscow. He mixed easily with foreign journalists of every nationality and political persuasion. He loved journalism for the contact it gave him with people and the outlet it provided for his writing. He was naturalized in October 1947.<br>
<br>While travelling and reporting Sosnow built a network of contacts around the world. Although his first love was journalism, the most obvious outlet for his talents and energy was international trade. On his arrival in England he worked with his uncle in the importation of fruit juices. In 1945 he took over a redundant orange juice factory and started, together with his wife, the manufacture of inexpensive fashion clothing under the name Estrava.<br>
<br>In 1955 Sosnow was asked by Joe Bradley, with whom he had developed a very close association, to take over the management of Carters Merchants, an import&#150;export company. In 1961 Estrava and Carters Merchants were combined into Whiteley Stevens, a textile company quoted on the London stock exchange. In the same year the group bought Gordon Woodrofe, with its trading interests in India, China, Japan, and Africa. In 1962 Sosnow changed the name of the group to United City Merchants. He now had an international trading group, which was to continue to grow and keep him travelling.<br>
<br>Gaining a reputation for barter, Sosnow became a central figure in international trade, and particularly trade behind the iron curtain. When he retired as chairman in 1981, United City Merchants was an international trading company, with offices worldwide, involved in banking, shipping, leather, raw materials, industrial machinery, cars, and turnkey projects. He had hoped that his very talented son, Norman, would take over from him, but he was killed in an air crash in 1967, at the age of twenty-three, while working for the company.<br>
<br>From 1981 onwards Sosnow devoted more of his time to predominantly educational charities. He became a governor and honorary fellow of the London School of Economics and was elected a fellow-commoner of Christ's College, Cambridge. He endowed chairs and travelling scholarships in both universities in his son's name; he had a great affection for and understanding of young people. He was very much involved in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute in Israel, and was closely associated with the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies and with the Institute of Jewish Affairs in London. Among his decorations were the Polish order of merit (1985) and the rank of comendador of the republic of Portugal (1973). He became a freeman of the City of London in 1960.<br>
<br>Sosnow was a short, affable, and energetic man, always immaculately dressed, and with a great sense of humour. He was never prepared to take &#145;no&#146; for an answer. As a journalist he searched for the scoop. As a businessman he expanded his company, which grew, not only in spite of the controls in the 1960s and 1970s, but because of them. He was never prepared to contest take-over bids but was willing to fight the system. When dividend controls were instituted he used them as an opportunity to conserve cash with which he bought businesses. He developed a technique for issuing tax-free bonus shares to his shareholders which was widely copied. He enjoyed the pomp and ceremony of the City and was happy when he was made a freeman of the City of London. He believed the basic tools necessary for success in international trade were a knowledge of and aptitude for languages, training in economics and international law, a love of travel, and an interest in modern history and people.<br>
<br>Sosnow was a voracious reader and an excellent academic lawyer, from whom solicitors and counsel learned many lessons. As a lawyer he derived immense satisfaction from his successful appeal to the House of Lords in 1982, <i>United City Merchants Investments Ltd v. Royal Bank of Canada</i>, which decided that where a letter of credit was in order on its face, refusal by a banker to pay on presentation did not extend to fraud to which the seller was not party.<br>
<br>In 1943 Sosnow married Sylvia, daughter of Mark Tafler, an authority on late nineteenth-century English engraved glass. As well as their son they had a daughter. They were a remarkable couple, Sylvia being an active partner in the business and contributing greatly to its success. Sosnow died at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, London, on 20 February 1987, and his wife died in 1988. A memorial service for Sosnow was held in July 1987 at the New West End Synagogue, London.<br>
