<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharpe,  Daniel</span>  (1806&#150;1856), <span class="occ">geologist and philologist</span>, was born on 6 April 1806 at Nottingham Place, Marylebone, Middlesex, the youngest son of Sutton Sharpe (1756&#150;1806), brewer, and his second wife, Maria (<i>d</i>. 1806), sister of the poet Samuel Rogers (1783&#150;1855). Orphaned before his first birthday (his mother died on 22 April 1806, his father on 26 September), he was looked after in Stoke Newington by a half-sister, who also took in a sister and four brothers.<br>
<br>Sharpe was educated for two years at a school in Stoke Newington, and from the age of twelve at Mr Cogan's school in Walthamstow, where he obtained a knowledge of the classics. At sixteen he became a clerk in the counting-house of Van Zeller, a Portuguese merchant in London. When he was twenty-five, Sharpe entered into a partnership with his brother Henry at Pinner's Hall, Broad Street, which became the leading London house in the trade with Portugal. For a year about 1830 and from 1835 to 1838, Sharpe lived in Portugal, which he visited frequently on business.<br>
<br>Sharpe had a long-standing interest in natural history, and joined the Geological Society of London in 1827. Papers read before the Society from 1832 made use of his travels by describing Portuguese geology, which had hitherto been little known. In the 1840s he turned to the Lake District and north Wales, regions where the older rocks had already become the subject of controversy. Sharpe argued that all of the strata originally identified as belonging to Adam Sedgwick's &#145;Cambrian&#146; were of the same age as Roderick Murchison's &#145;Silurian&#146;. This had been suspected for some time on fossil grounds, but Sharpe's structural evidence for an equivalence was new. His brash self-confidence in trespassing on Sedgwick's territory led to puns about a &#145;sharp move&#146; and the &#145;Sharp fellow&#146;, clear references to the fact that Sharpe spent his days in a counting-house.<br>
<br>During his research on the older rocks, Sharpe became involved in debates about slaty cleavage, which (as Sedgwick had shown) had to be distinguished from ordinary stratification. Sharpe proposed that this structure resulted, neither from crystallization nor from the force of upheaval, but from lateral pressure. He applied this theory in 1854 to some of the most vexed problems in alpine geology, particularly at Mont Blanc and the valley of Chamonix, where semi-crystalline schists appeared to alternate with younger Jurassic strata. In papers for the Royal Society and the Geological Society, he also tackled the complex geology of the Scottish highlands, and with George Bellas Greenough constructed a revised geological map of Scotland in 1852.<br>
<br>Sharpe's last paper was his most speculative. It argued that the Alps had been until fairly recently covered by the sea, which had left marks of its presence at a height of some 9000 feet. Sharpe thus ascribed to wave action most of the erosion that other geologists (following Louis Agassiz) attributed to glaciers. However, this bold extension of Robert Chambers's theory of ancient sea terraces won little support.<br>
<br>Unlike many geologists of the period, Sharpe identified his own fossils rather than sending them out to specialists. His first paper for the Geological Society in 1827 described a new species of ichthyosaurus, and he later became especially interested in invertebrate palaeontology. In 1846, together with John Morris, he identified shells collected from the Falkland Islands by Charles Darwin, and in 1848 he did the same for specimens collected by Charles Lyell during his travels in North America. In both cases Sharpe's results provided strong support for Murchison's concept of a globally valid Silurian fauna. At his death Sharpe was engaged in a monograph for the Palaeontographical Society on the fossil cephalopoda of the English Chalk.<br>
<br>Sharpe, who never married, became a familiar figure within metropolitan intellectual circles, especially through connections with his uncle Samuel Rogers and friendships made at the Geological Society. Known for his sarcastic wit, love of controversy, and philanthropic benevolence, for many years he served as secretary of the school for the poor in Harp Alley, Fleet Market. A keen student of ancient philology, Sharpe published an appendix on Lycian inscriptions and coins in Sir Charles Fellows's second account of his discoveries at Xanthus. Sharpe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1850, and became Geological Society president in February 1856. He died a few months later on 31 May 1856 in his lodgings in Soho Square, having fractured his skull in a riding accident. He was buried at St John's Church, Hampstead.<br>
