<span class="headword">Skinner,  John Edwin Hilary</span>  (1839&#150;1894), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, the elder son of Allen Maclean Skinner QC, and a descendant of Matthew Skinner, was born in London in January 1839, and educated at London University, where he graduated LLD in 1861. In the same year he was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn, and went on the northern circuit. A first-rate linguist, he obtained a commission from the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> as special correspondent with the Danish army in the war of 1864. He was present during the campaign until the fall of Alsen at the end of June, whereupon Christian IX awarded him the Dannebrog order. A partial success only can be ascribed to his attempt to unravel the Schleswig-Holstein complication in <span class="italic">The Tale of Danish Heroism</span> (1865); his opinion as to the superiority of the Prussian breech-loaders, however, was amply vindicated in the following year, when he reported the Austro-Prussian campaign. In the meantime Skinner had visited North America, and on his return wrote two sketchy volumes entitled <span class="italic">After the Storm</span> (1866). In 1867 he ran the blockade into Crete, and in <span class="italic">Roughing it in Crete</span> (1867) advocated the cession of Crete to Greece. This, he contended, would not only conciliate liberal opinion, but would concentrate the Turkish power. Nine years later, on this same subject he contributed <span class="italic">Turkish Rule in Crete</span>, denouncing the &#145;blighting effect&#146; of Turkish misgovernment, to the <span class="roman">Papers on the Eastern Question</span> (9, 1877). During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Skinner was attached to the crown prince of Prussia's staff, and described the battles from W&ouml;rth to Sedan. He carried his account of the decisive battle from Donch&eacute;ry, near Sedan, to London, riding neck and neck with W. H. Russell of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and crossing from Ostend in the same boat; their narratives appeared simultaneously on 6 September, having been anticipated only in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>.<br>
<br>For a short time, in the spring of 1881, Skinner was assistant judicial commissioner in Cyprus. In 1885 he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of South Paddington, standing as a Liberal against Lord Randolph Churchill, and in 1886 he contested the Strand division of London against W. H. Smith, equally unsuccessfully. He died at the H&ocirc;tel de France, rue de Constantine, Setif, Algeria, where he had gone for his health, on 20 November 1894; his wife, Louisa Sarah Skinner, survived him. A &#145;dapper little man&#146;, overflowing with vivacity, he was referred to by Archibald Forbes in 1870 as one of the &eacute;lite of the profession.<br>
