<span class="headword">Palmer,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">ejected minister</span>, was baptized at Great Comberton, Worcestershire, on 27 October 1616, the only son of Anthony Palmer. Although the younger Anthony Palmer was married with at least two children, nothing is known of his mother, his wife, or his family life, although one of his works mentioned &#145;many dear Relations and Kindred&#146; in Gloucestershire  (Palmer, <span class="italic">Gospel New Creature</span>, sig. A2). He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1634, graduated BA on 7 April 1638, was admitted fellow on 29 November 1640, and graduated MA on 7 December 1641, taking orders shortly afterwards. He took the solemn league and covenant in 1643 and signed the rigidly presbyterian &#145;Gloucester-shire ministers testimony&#146; in 1648, but was always a committed Independent. He was presented to the rectory of Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, on 4 July 1646, resigning his fellowship and taking the engagement in 1649.<br>
<br>Palmer was an influential figure in Cromwellian Gloucestershire, as part of a closely knit group of Independent pastors, notably Carnslew Helme at Winchcombe, William Tray at Oddington, and John Wells at Tewkesbury. They were connected to several radical JPs who had risen through military service and membership of gathered churches. With these men, their congregations, and others, Palmer signed four petitions between 1653 and 1657. They successfully nominated the Gloucestershire members of the Barebone's Parliament, urged Cromwell to reject the crown in 1656, and generally upheld the cause of the gathered churches. As part of this group, Palmer was involved in two significant local controversies: a disputation in Winchcombe church against the Anglican Clement Barksdale in November 1653, and the attempted prosecution of the itinerant Ranter Richard Coppin for the doctrines he preached at Stow on the Wold in March 1654. He was also an assistant commissioner to the Gloucestershire expurgators in 1654 and attended the Savoy House conference in 1658. Of Palmer's six published works, <span class="italic">A Scripture-Rale to the Lord's Table</span> (1654) and <span class="italic">The Gospel New Creature</span> (1658) were the most important. The former expounded his belief in the need for the godly to separate voluntarily from the profane masses and preserve unmixed communion under the discipline of the minister, as in the primitive church. This, to Palmer, transcended differences of emphasis between presbyterian and Independent over matters such as appeals. After much prayer, his group agreed that attempting to enforce purity through the magistrate was derogatory to Christ; only mutual agreed subjection to him could bring people together in holy fellowship. In practice they depended on sympathetic JPs to enforce their views, which caused much discontent in their parishes.<br>
<br>Palmer was ill-treated by the cavalier-dominated militia in the spring of 1660. Like Helme, he abandoned his living and moved to London, where he lived at Little Moorfields and headed a mixed Baptist&#150;Congregationalist church at Pinners' Hall. Both men remained committed opponents of the Restoration regime, which regarded them as Fifth Monarchists and kept them under sporadic surveillance. Palmer preached to the large gathering in Glovers' Hall on 10 March 1661, soon after Venner's rising, and was one of five main preachers at the large conventicle of All Hallows-the-Great in late 1661, where he prayed for the final fall of Babylon and urged the faithful to have no dealings with the restored Anglican clergy or with superstition of any kind. In November 1661 he and Helme were reportedly travelling around to &#145;blow up the Coales of rebellion&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/44/135) and he was named by some informers as one of the &#145;council of six&#146; which masterminded the Tong Plot of late 1662. This&#151;and, indeed, the existence of the plot&#151;is uncertain, but Palmer did have connections with known plotters at various times. He was licensed as a Congregationalist at a house on London Bridge on 19 April 1672, died in London on 26 January 1679, and was buried in the New Bethlehem graveyard, Moorfields, London.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_21172"></a><span class="headword">Anthony Palmer</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1693), also an <span class="occ">ejected minister</span>, was baptized in Barnstaple, Devon, on 23 January 1613, the son of William Palmer of Barnstaple. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1631, graduated BA in 1635, and proceeded MA in 1637. He was presented to the sequestered rectory of Bratton Fleming, Devon, in 1645. He was a member of the Devon Association in 1655 and was ejected by October 1662, despite having previously protested his fidelity to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>; Edward Walker noted that he had administered communion only once in fourteen years in Bratton. He then returned to Barnstaple, where he was licensed as a presbyterian in April 1672. In 1690 he was recorded as having no fixed ministry. He was buried on 12 September 1693 in Barnstaple.<br>
