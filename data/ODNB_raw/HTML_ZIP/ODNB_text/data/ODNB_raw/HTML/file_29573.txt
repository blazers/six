<span class="headword">Williamson,  Samuel</span>  (1792&#150;1840), <span class="occ">landscape and marine painter</span>, was the younger son of John Williamson of Liverpool, in which town he was born, and his wife, Sarah.<br>
<br>His father, <a name="cosubject_29569"></a><span class="headword">John Williamson</span>  (1751&#150;1818), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at Ripon, Yorkshire. He was apprenticed to an &#145;ornamental&#146; painter in Birmingham, married his wife Sarah in 1781, settled in Liverpool <i>c</i>.1783, and continued to reside there, practising as a portrait painter, until his death. Among his best-known works are portraits of the collector William Roscoe (attributed portrait, <i>c</i>.1784; NPG), Sir William Beechey RA, H. Fuseli RA (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), the Revd John Clowes, and Nathan Litherland, the inventor of the patent lever watch. He was a member of the Liverpool Academy, and a constant exhibitor at the local exhibitions. In 1783 he exhibited a portrait at the Royal Academy. His portraits were thought to be correct likenesses and fairly executed. He also painted miniatures, although they were not in the best style of that art. He died on 27 May 1818, probably in Liverpool.<br>
<br>In 1811 Samuel Williamson had three landscapes hung in the first exhibition of the Liverpool Academy, of which body he was a member. In their later exhibitions as well as at the first exhibition of the Royal Manchester Institution in 1827 and the subsequent annual exhibitions, he was represented by a large number of landscapes and seascapes. He exhibited a landscape at the Royal Academy in 1811. He earned a considerable reputation as a painter of seapieces and landscapes, and was highly esteemed by his fellow townsmen. He is said to have travelled abroad and to have been in Rome in 1818, when he might have encountered John Gibson. On his death, which took place at his home in Benson Street, Liverpool, on 7 June 1840, an obelisk to his memory was erected in St James's cemetery, a lithograph of which, by W. Collingwood, was published. His style, which in its earlier phase demonstrated an awareness of classical and Dutch influences, was distinguished later in the 1820s by a warmer palette and more expressive brushwork. In general, his pictures are well composed, and his later paintings display a certain charm achieved through use of light and colour. There are five oil painting as well as many sketches by him at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. Further examples of his work are to be found at the Williamson Art Gallery, Birkenhead. There are other works in private collections in the district.<br>
