<span class="headword">Edmund</span> <span class="st"> [Edmund of Langley]</span>, first duke of York  (1341&#150;1402), <span class="occ">prince</span>, was the fifth (but fourth surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8519/', "Edward III, king of England")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22110/', "Philippa of Hainault")</script>, daughter of William, count of Hainault and Holland.<h2>
<a name="Birthandearlylife"></a>Birth and early life</h2>Edmund was born on 5 June 1341 at his father's manor of Kings Langley in Hertfordshire. According to Walsingham he was baptized by the abbot of St Albans. The abbot and the earls of Arundel and Surrey were his godfathers. John de Warenne, earl of Surrey, died in 1347 and bequeathed his young godson a glass goblet decorated with gilded silver and standing on a tripod. The earl died without an heir male and the king granted Edmund his lands north of the Trent. These lay predominantly in Yorkshire, and included the castle and lordship of Conisbrough; the bulk of the inheritance, however, went to Edmund's other godfather, the earl of Arundel. Edmund's first experience of war came in 1359, when he accompanied his father on the unsuccessful Rheims campaign. Edward III had intended to take Rheims and have himself crowned king of France, but he was compelled to abandon his siege of the city and in the following year he concluded the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny with France: Edmund was one of the witnesses to the treaty. In 1361 (probably on 23 April) he became a knight of the Garter. In the Michaelmas parliament of 1362 Edward, wishing to honour his three younger sons who were now all of age, created <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16750/', "Lionel of Antwerp, duke of Clarence")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14843/', "John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster")</script>, and Edmund earl of Cambridge. He was granted an annuity of 1000 marks to maintain his estate as earl, but only gradually over the following years was this annuity converted into grants of land. He received the lordship of Tynedale in 1375 (though at his death in 1402 the lordship was said to be worth nothing because of damage inflicted by the Scots) and in 1377 he was granted the castle and manor of Fotheringhay in Northamptonshire. He also received the castles and manors of Stamford and Grantham in Lincolnshire, but despite these grants he remained poorly endowed by comparison with his peers who were not of royal blood.<h2>
<a name="Negotiationsformarriage"></a>Negotiations for marriage</h2>A more substantial endowment at home might have come from a marriage to an English heiress, but Edward III had other plans for his son. In the early 1360s Edward hoped to negotiate a marriage between Edmund and Margaret, daughter and heir of Louis de M&acirc;le, count of Flanders. Edward III stood to gain substantially from such a marriage. Not only would Flanders move firmly into the English political and diplomatic orbit, but Edmund would become, by marriage, lord of a large appanage on France's northern and eastern borders that would include not just Flanders but the counties of Artois, Burgundy, Nevers, and Rethel, to which Margaret was also heir. A &#145;northern Aquitaine&#146; would thus be created, in which English influence would be dominant. It is not surprising, therefore, that Charles V of France vigorously opposed the marriage, putting forward as his own candidate his brother Philip, duke of Burgundy.<br>
<br>Negotiations between England and Flanders opened in February 1362, and with the co-operation of Margaret's father they moved forward to a successful conclusion. On 19 October 1364 a marriage treaty was agreed between the two rulers. However, Edmund and Margaret were related within the forbidden degrees, and a papal dispensation was therefore necessary if the marriage was to proceed. This gave Charles V an opportunity to put pressure on the papal curia at Avignon to refuse the dispensation; the pope, Urban V, himself a Frenchman, gave way; the dispensation was refused, and the marriage negotiations were finally abandoned in 1369.<br>
<br>Even before the Flemish marriage proposal collapsed Edward III had begun to look elsewhere for a marriage for Edmund. In 1366 he opened negotiations for a marriage between either Lionel, duke of Clarence, or Edmund, and Violante, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the ruler of Milan. Lionel was Edward's preferred candidate for this marriage, which was celebrated in Milan in May 1368. By 1370, however, the focus of Edward's dynastic and diplomatic ambitions had turned to the Iberian peninsula. In 1371 John of Gaunt had married, as his second wife, Constanza, elder daughter of Pedro the Cruel, king of Castile, and his mistress Maria de Padilla. Pedro regarded Constanza and her younger sister Isabella as his heirs, and, by his marriage to Constanza, Gaunt acquired a claim to the throne of Castile, which was to preoccupy him particularly between 1385 and 1389. <a name="cosubject_54467"></a><span class="headword">Isabella of Castile</span>  (1355&#150;1392) was married to Edmund a few months later, on 11 July 1372, at Wallingford, becoming countess of Cambridge and later duchess of York. The purpose of the marriage was to reinforce the dynastic link between England and Castile and to ensure that both Pedro's heirs were married into the English royal line.<br>
<br>There is little doubt that, in marrying Isabella, Edmund was simply carrying out his father's instructions. His apparent willingness to do so (in contrast, it seems, to his eldest brother Edward, the Black Prince) has contributed powerfully to the impression of feebleness of character and idleness of disposition which modern historians have identified in Edmund. There is some contemporary warrant for such opinions. Froissart described Edmund as &#145;mol et simple et paisible&#146; (&#145;indolent, guileless, and peaceable&#146;), and Sir Richard Stury apparently told Froissart during his visit to England in 1395 that Edmund preferred a life of ease, spending his time with his new wife, Joan of Kent, whom Stury described as &#145;a beautiful young lady&#146;  (<span class="italic">&#338;uvres</span>, 15.163). The later chronicler John Hardyng struck a similar note, saying that:<blockquote>
<div>When all the lords to councell and parlyament<br>
</div>
<div>Went, he wolde to hunte and also to hawekyng.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, ed. Ellis, 340)</blockquote>Edmund's conduct of the only military expedition for which he was responsible, to Portugal in 1381, suggests a lack of capacity for military command, and although Richard II (not necessarily a good judge of character) twice appointed him keeper of the realm (in 1394&#150;5 and in 1399), his defection to Henry Bolingbroke in July 1399 suggests a lack of firmness of purpose. Perhaps contemporary judgements on his character were correct.<br>
<br>Isabella seems to have found him boring. A more spirited woman than her sister Constanza, she became the subject of various scandals at court. She is said to have had an affair with Richard II's half-brother John Holland, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1400), and Walsingham described her as a worldly and sensual woman, although he goes on to say that she repented and reformed before her death, which took place on 23 December 1392 when she was only thirty-seven. She was buried in the church of the Friars Preachers at Kings Langley in Hertfordshire. In her will she made no legacy to her husband; apart from a few bequests of jewellery, the residue of her estate was left to Richard II in the hope that he would grant her younger son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23502/', "Richard, earl of Cambridge (d. 1415)")</script>, who was the king's godson, an annuity of 500 marks for life. The king later issued letters patent giving effect to her wishes. In view of her reputation another of her bequests is not without irony: she left a book of vices and virtues to one of her executors, Sir Lewis Clifford.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer"></a>Military career</h2>Although Edmund showed no great enthusiasm or aptitude for war, he took part in several of the expeditions which England sent to France in the 1370s. He accompanied his eldest brother, the Black Prince, on the expedition to Spain in 1367 which culminated in the victory at N&aacute;jera. In 1369 he brought a retinue of 400 men-at-arms and 400 archers to serve with John Hastings, earl of Pembroke, on campaign in Brittany and Angoul&ecirc;me, and in the following year he first joined Pembroke again on an expedition to relieve the fortress of Belle Perche and then accompanied the Black Prince on the campaign which resulted in the siege and sack of Limoges. In 1372 he engaged to serve with Edward III in a proposed expedition to France, but although the expedition put to sea it had to turn back after a few weeks and was then abandoned. By 1374 Brittany had become the main focus of English military activity: on 1 August Edmund, together with Edmund Mortimer, earl of March, and Lord Despenser, sealed indentures for an expedition which would, it was hoped, relieve Brest and B&eacute;cherel in Brittany and St Sauveur-le-Vicomte in the Cotentin, which were hard-pressed by the French. The expedition did not sail, however, until 25 April in the following year. It took St Pol de L&eacute;on and laid siege to Quimperl&eacute;, but the truce agreed at Bruges on 27 June put an end to military operations, and the expedition returned home with its leaders disappointed and out of pocket. Edward III now expected Edmund to substitute diplomacy for war, and on 1 September 1375 appointed him as a commissioner to negotiate with France in the continuing talks at Bruges.<br>
<br>In none of these expeditions did Edmund hold sole command, and there is no suggestion in the chronicles that he had acquitted himself with great distinction. While serving with the Black Prince, however, he acquired some experience of campaigning in Spain, and when Iberian affairs once again came to the fore in 1380 John of Gaunt proposed that he should lead an expedition to Portugal which would join the Portuguese in an attack on Castile. The Anglo-Portuguese alliance of 1373 was renewed, and Edmund's eldest son Edward (<i>b</i>. 1373) was betrothed to Beatriz, daughter of Fernando, king of Portugal. Edmund's expedition sailed from Plymouth in July 1381; his lieutenants were mainly associates of Gaunt with previous experience of the Iberian peninsula; many of the troops, however, were Castilians loyal to Gaunt, and Gascons. The modern historian of the campaign has observed that &#145;the feeble Edmund of Cambridge was the worst possible leader to command so heterogeneous an army&#146;  (Russell, 303). Little went right on the expedition; the marriage between Edward and Beatriz was solemnized, but Edmund's irresoluteness and Fernando's deviousness led to the English army staying in camp at Vila Vi&ccedil;osa, close to the Castilian border, over the winter. Some elements in the army mutinied, partly perhaps through boredom but mainly because they had not been paid. In the spring of 1382 it seemed that they might at last see some action, but Fernando was under pressure to make peace with Castile, and an agreement was concluded in August. Edmund now had to extricate himself and his army as best he could, and he arrived back in England in October 1382 to a hostile reception and owing his troops much of their pay. In a final humiliation the pope annulled the marriage between Edward and Beatriz, because both were under age, and Fernando married Beatriz to Juan I of Castile. Gaunt was asked to help to discharge Edmund's debts, but he refused, and even insisted in his will that his executors should not contribute towards them. When Gaunt renounced his right to the Castilian throne in the treaty of Bayonne of 1388, any right that Edmund might also have had by virtue of his marriage to Isabella seems to have gone by default, for it is not mentioned in the treaty. None the less, personal relations between the two brothers seem to have remained cordial during these years.<br>
<br>Edmund has been severely criticized by modern historians for the failure of the Portuguese expedition. It is true that he showed little initiative or enterprise as a leader; but the expedition was essentially a Lancastrian idea, intended to further Gaunt's ambitions in Castile, and Fernando's deviousness in negotiating with Castile behind Edmund's back put him in an almost impossible position. The d&eacute;b&acirc;cle in Portugal suggests not so much that Edmund was incompetent, but that once again he had allowed his family to use him in the furtherance of their political and diplomatic schemes.<h2>
<a name="EdmundspoliticalroleinRichardIIsreign"></a>Edmund's political role in Richard II's reign</h2>Edmund never again led a military expedition overseas, but he joined Richard II's expedition to Scotland in 1385, and on 6 August, &#145;at the king's entry into Scotland&#146;, he was created duke of York and given an annuity of &pound;1000 (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.205). Neither this annuity nor his earlier annuity as earl of Cambridge were ever fully replaced by grants of landed property, and he evidently had difficulty in obtaining payment of his annuities. In 1380, for example, he had had to sue at the exchequer for payment of the annuity of 500 marks granted to him at the beginning of Richard II's reign. He was granted lands in Wiltshire in 1387, and the reversion of the honour of Rayleigh in Essex in 1391, but like his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27197/', "Thomas, duke of Gloucester")</script>, he remained dependent on exchequer annuities for part of his income for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Despite Edmund's lack of an appropriate territorial endowment and the difficulties he encountered in obtaining payment of his annuities, he did not show the hostility to the king and his courtiers which Gloucester developed in these years: perhaps this is further evidence of his &#145;mol et paisible&#146; character. In his loyalty to the crown he resembled his elder brother Gaunt rather than Gloucester, but his indolence and limited ability probably explain why he played only a minor part in government until 1386. He was appointed constable of Dover Castle and warden of the Cinque Ports on 12 June 1376 and held office until 1 February 1381. During that time he was also justice of the peace in Kent, as might have been expected, but otherwise he held few commissions of the peace until the last years of Richard II's reign. On 28 September 1385 he was appointed justice of Chester, but within two months he had sought and obtained power to appoint someone else to do the job on his behalf. He surrendered the post on 8 September 1387 and was replaced by Richard's favourite, Robert de Vere.<br>
<br>Edmund was a member of the commission of government which was established in the parliament of October 1386, and in the autumn of the following year, as relations between Richard and Gloucester deteriorated, he attempted a moderating role. After the victory of the lords appellant at Radcot Bridge in December 1387, Edmund, together with the earl of Northumberland and three bishops, sought to mediate between the king and the appellants, though without success. In the Merciless Parliament of February 1388 he was appointed to the committee set up by the appellants to examine the charges against Sir Nicholas Brembre; the committee reported that it could find nothing in his conduct which justified his death. Later in the same parliament Richard nominated Edmund and Sir John Cobham to appear before the Commons and plead for Sir Simon Burley's life, again unsuccessfully. Edmund may have been ineffective, but he was loyal and moderate in his political stance, and in the violence of his dispute with the duke of Gloucester over Burley's life showed for once an independence of mind. In the calmer political atmosphere of the early 1390s he attended the council frequently, and in 1391 he and Gaunt were appointed to conduct negotiations at Amiens for peace with France, though perhaps he owed his place to his status rather than to his ability.<br>
<br>Confident of his loyalty, Richard appointed Edmund keeper of the realm during his absence in Ireland from October 1394 to May 1395, and he was again appointed keeper for six weeks in the autumn of 1396 when Richard went to France for his marriage to Isabella, daughter of Charles VI. As political tension rose again in 1397, Edmund remained loyal to Richard. Froissart suggests that Gloucester discussed his opposition to Richard II's plans for peace with France with him, but had little respect for his opinions. The author of the <span class="italic">Chronicque de la traison et mort de Richart deux roy Dengleterre</span> stated that Edmund was one of the nobles whom Gloucester and his fellow conspirators intended to arrest and imprison in 1397, but neither Froissart nor the author of the <span class="italic">Traison</span> are reliable witnesses: the evidence for a conspiracy by Gloucester and others against the king in 1397 is virtually non-existent.<br>
<br>In the parliament of September 1397, when Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick were arraigned for treason, Richard evidently regarded Edmund as loyal. He was given licence to come to parliament with 100 men-at-arms and 200 archers &#145;for the comfort of the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1396&#150;9</i>, p. 192), but his part in the proceedings of the parliament seems to have been little more than formal. Trusting in his loyalty, Richard now gave him a greatly enhanced role as a justice of the peace, appointing him to the commission in Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Essex, Norfolk, the West Riding of Yorkshire, and the Holland and Kesteven divisions of Lincolnshire. His son Edward, however, was more closely identified with the court, and was created duke of Aumale during the parliament. Perhaps Edward's standing at court served to protect Edmund from the conspiracies which now seemed to be aimed at his brother Gaunt, and when Richard set off for Ireland again on 1 June 1399 Edmund was once again appointed keeper of the realm.<h2>
<a name="EdmundsroleintheinvasionofBolingbrokeanddepositionofRichardII"></a>Edmund's role in the invasion of Bolingbroke and deposition of Richard II</h2>Henry Bolingbroke began his preparations to invade England as soon as he was satisfied that Richard had landed in Ireland. Edmund got wind of his movements by 28 June, and assumed at that stage that Henry intended to take Calais as a base for his invasion of England. He summoned shire levies from the south-east to muster at Ware and prepare to defend the realm against invasion, but about 1 July Henry landed in Yorkshire and Edmund now tried to raise a full-scale army to oppose him. He summoned those of the king's knights and esquires who were still in England; the shire levies from the southern counties answered his appeal, and so did a number of magnates, including John Beaufort, marquess of Dorset, and the earls of Suffolk and Wiltshire. His hastily assembled army numbered perhaps 3000; yet in the event he offered no resistance to Henry. At Berkeley on 27 July he went over to Henry; he rode with him to Bristol, and according to Walsingham used his authority as keeper of the realm to demand the city's surrender to Henry.<br>
<br>Edmund's defection ensured that resistance to Henry would be no more than sporadic and localized. He had a sizeable army at his back, yet chose not to fight his invading nephew. Some historians have argued that this too shows his incompetence and irresoluteness, and that in the final crisis of his reign Richard had entrusted his realm to the wrong man. Edmund faced, however, a formidable opponent. Supporters from the north had been rallying to Henry since he landed, and he had been joined by the retinues of the earls of Northumberland and Westmorland, Northumberland's son Henry Percy (Hotspur), and the lords Willoughby, Ros, and Greystoke. Some of Edmund's troops had deserted well before he met Henry at Berkeley, while the best troops in his army were those commanded by John Beaufort, Henry's half-brother. It is possible furthermore that Edmund himself, for all his previous loyalty to Richard, had some sympathy with the exiled and disinherited Henry Bolingbroke. There is no evidence that his castles at Wakefield and Conisbrough in Yorkshire offered any resistance to Henry, and Doncaster, where Henry rallied his troops before marching south, was one of his possessions.<br>
<br>Edmund did not, however, play any part in the events leading to Richard's capture and imprisonment in the Tower of London. His part in the deposition proceedings was formal, although he and the two archbishops conducted Henry to the throne after his claim to the crown had been accepted by the assembly that met on 30 September 1399. He gave his support to the new Lancastrian regime, and was appropriately rewarded by Henry IV. His possession of the castle and lordship of Rising in Norfolk was confirmed, he was granted the lordship of the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, and received preference at the exchequer for the payment of his annuities assigned on the wool customs. He attended court and witnessed charters, but his political career was now drawing to its close.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsdeathandprogeny"></a>Final years, death, and progeny</h2>If the author of the <span class="italic">Traison</span> is to be believed, Edmund's last important act was to relay to the king the report of a conspiracy against Henry in January 1400 that Edmund had received from his son Edward, who was probably implicated in the early stages of the plot. Edmund's action enabled Henry to move swiftly to frustrate the conspiracy. His loyalty to the new regime, as to the old regime before the events of 1399, remained firm. He made his will on 25 November 1400, at Kings Langley, where he died on 1 August 1402 and was buried beside his first wife in the church of the Friars Preachers. His second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61777/', "Joan (d. 1434)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52801/', "Willoughby family (per. c.1300&#150;1523)")</script>], daughter of Thomas Holland, earl of Kent, whom he had married about 1393, survived until 1434. He had two sons and a daughter from his first marriage: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22356/', "Edward, earl of Rutland")</script>, who inherited the dukedom of York on his father's death and was killed at Agincourt in 1415; Richard, who was created earl of Cambridge in 1414 and was executed the following year for his involvement in the Southampton conspiracy against Henry V; and Constance [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57622/', "Despenser, Constance, Lady Despenser (c.1375&#150;1416)")</script>], who married Thomas, Lord Despenser, killed in 1400 for his involvement in the January plot against Henry IV that her elder brother had betrayed to their father. He had no children with his second wife.<br>
