<span class="headword">Logan,  Robert, of Restalrig</span>  (1555&#150;1606), <span class="occ">landowner and conspirator</span>, was the only son of Sir Robert Logan (<i>c</i>.1533&#150;1561), sixth laird of Restalrig, and his wife, Agnes Gray (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1585), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11347/', "Patrick Gray, fourth Lord Gray")</script>. He was descended from a family of Ayrshire origin which had acquired the barony of Restalrig, just outside Edinburgh, through marriage in the late fourteenth century. Logan's father died when he was only six years old, and after 1565 his mother married Alexander, fifth Lord Home. Logan and his mother and stepfather were among the Marian defenders of Edinburgh Castle when the fortress surrendered to the regent Morton in 1573, but the young laird and his mother were set free. Following the death of Lord Home in 1575 his mother was married a third time, to Thomas Lyon, master of Glamis. Logan himself married Elizabeth MacGill (<i>c</i>.1560&#150;1622), daughter of David MacGill, later king's advocate, shortly before he was served heir to his Midlothian, Berwickshire, and Ayrshire estates in 1576. The marriage was short-lived, for by 1578 Elizabeth had returned to her father's household. The couple probably divorced some time in that year, for in spring 1579 she married Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean.<br>
<br>Logan supported the Ruthven raid in 1582 and after the new government had fallen in 1584 he was ordered to surrender his seaward seat, Fast Castle. In May 1586 he sat on the assize which acquitted Archibald Douglas of involvement in Darnley's murder. He was married again in October, to Marion Ker, of whom little is known except that she gave birth to his heir Robert as well as other children. In 1587 Logan accompanied the embassy of his cousin Patrick, master of Gray, to London to intercede for Queen Mary's life. When Gray fell from favour on their return, Logan was among those who stood surety that he would pass into exile. His taste for intrigue also drew Logan into association with Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell, and he was outlawed for conspiring with the earl in February 1593.<br>
<br>Fast Castle became a frequent point of arrival for foreign mail packets and persons illicitly entering Scotland. In December 1593 Logan stole gold and silver plate, valued at 3000 merks, from William Nesbit of Newton, and the following April two of his men assaulted and robbed James Gray, an Edinburgh burgess travelling on the road to Berwick, of &pound;950. In July 1594 Logan contracted John Napier of Merchiston to use his arts to uncover treasure supposed to be secreted within Fast Castle. Napier was promised a third share and safe conduct back to Edinburgh. It is improbable that anything was found, but the episode evidently did not endear Napier to Logan, for when leasing property in 1596 he forbade his tenant to sublet to anyone of Logan's surname.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1600 Logan may have been drawn into the Gowrie conspiracy, though possible evidence of his culpability was not to emerge until after his death. Logan considered a venture with Peregrine Bertie, thirteenth Lord Willoughby of Eresby, to sail to the West Indies in 1601, but Willoughby's death in June arrested this scheme. Logan had meanwhile begun to dispose of his estates, for reasons which remain unclear, selling Fast Castle to Archibald Douglas of Pittendreich in November 1602, the barony of Restalrig to Lord Balmerino in 1604, and finally his Berwickshire lands to the earl of Dunbar. However, he had limited success in realizing the money from these sales and in 1605 travelled unsuccessfully to London to force the issue. Weakened by fever he died in Edinburgh's Canongate in July 1606. Two years after his death, his one time legal agent George Sprot, an Eyemouth notary, let slip while drinking that he had knowledge of the Gowrie conspiracy. Under arrest he confessed to possessing letters penned by Logan to the earl of Gowrie and others suggesting a plot to abduct the king to Fast Castle. Although Sprot admitted under torture that he had forged these letters, when the earl of Dunbar intervened in the interrogation he reverted to his original confession implicating Logan, while still maintaining the letters were themselves forgeries. Sprot was hanged for his part in the conspiracy in August, and the following June Logan's corpse was dug up and produced in court in the treason trial which forfeited his son. This outcome was of considerable benefit to Dunbar, who owed 15,000 merks to Logan's heir.<br>
<br>Willoughby perhaps best summarized Logan's character when he judged him &#145;a vain, loose man, a great favourer of thieves reputed, yet a man of good clan, as they here term it, and a good fellow&#146;  (Bain, 2.1034).<br>
