<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sinclair, Sir  Edwyn Sinclair  Alexander-, of Freswick</span>  (1865&#150;1945), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Malta on 12 December 1865, the second son of Captain John Hobhouse Inglis Alexander RN (1832&#150;1875) of Southbar and Boghall, Renfrew, and his wife, Isabella Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1883), daughter of Thomas Cochrane Hume, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Isabella, daughter and heir of William Sinclair, of Freswick and Dunbeath in Caithness. He succeeded his elder brother to the Southbar property in 1892, and in 1894, on succeeding his second cousin as laird to the estate of Freswick, adopted the additional surname of Sinclair.<br>
<br>After entering the Royal Navy as a cadet on <i>Britannia</i> in 1879 Alexander served on the China station from early 1881 in the armour-plated iron ship <i>Iron Duke</i>, flagship of George Willes. He was promoted midshipman in August 1881 and sub-lieutenant in January 1886. After serving in the <i>Active</i> and taking scientific and technical courses he joined the <i>Fearless</i> in the Mediterranean in March 1888, but left her on promotion to lieutenant in January 1890 to become flag lieutenant to Richard Tracey in the channel squadron. When Tracey became admiral superintendent, Malta, in 1892, Alexander accompanied him and gained experience in dockyard and administrative work. On 26 January 1892 Alexander married Julia Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1930), daughter of Colonel Charles Vereker Hamilton-Campbell, of Netherplace, Ayrshire. They had two sons and one daughter. On 7 November 1933 he married Maud Kathleen, who survived him, widow of Major William Robinson Campbell, of the 14th hussars, and younger daughter of Captain Samuel Yates Holt Davenport, of the Royal Sussex regiment, Territorial Army.<br>
<br>From 1893 to 1896 he served in the battleship <i>Ramillies</i>, flagship of Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, and from 1897 to 1900 was his flag lieutenant when he was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. After his promotion to commander in 1901, Alexander-Sinclair commanded the destroyer <i>Albatross</i> from June 1902 and the dispatch vessel <i>Surprise</i> from January 1904. He was promoted captain in June 1905 at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, where he remained until 1908. From 1909 to 1910 he commanded the second destroyer flotilla in home waters and in 1911 became flag captain to Sir Arthur Moore, the commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. He returned to sea in September 1913, as captain of the battleship <i>Temeraire</i> in the Home Fleet, and was still in command of her at the outbreak of war in 1914.<br>
<br>As a part of the extensive reorganization of the Grand Fleet which followed the battle of the Dogger Bank in January 1915, Alexander-Sinclair became commodore commanding the 1st light-cruiser squadron with his broad pennant in the <i>Galatea</i>. On 31 May 1916 the <i>Galatea</i> was part of the screen of the Battle-Cruiser Fleet under Sir David Beatty when she altered course to examine a neutral merchant vessel. As Alexander-Sinclair closed this ship he sighted two enemy destroyers approaching from the opposite direction. His &#145;enemy in sight&#146; signal brought the Battle-Cruiser Fleet, and subsequently the whole Grand Fleet, into the action known as the battle of Jutland.<br>
<br>Alexander-Sinclair was appointed CB in 1916. In 1917 he was appointed rear-admiral commanding the 6th light-cruiser squadron with his flag in the <i>Cardiff</i>. In November 1917 he played a prominent part in the action with the German second scouting group in the Heligoland bight, after which he was praised by Admiral Beatty, and others, including the Germans, for his &#145;skill and determination &hellip; and resolute manner&#146; in difficult circumstances  (Marder, 4.305). Twelve months later he had the role of leading the surrendered German high sea fleet into Rosyth with the British Grand Fleet. For his war services he was appointed KCB. In the spring of 1919 the 6th light-cruiser squadron was transferred to the Mediterranean under his command and renamed the 3rd light-cruiser squadron.<br>
<br>In 1920 Alexander-Sinclair was appointed admiral superintendent, Portsmouth Dockyard. In 1922 he became vice-admiral commanding 1st battle squadron with his flag in the <i>Barham</i> and for a while, during the illness of the commander-in-chief, Sir John De Robeck, was senior admiral in the Atlantic Fleet. Arthur Marder has described Alexander-Sinclair as a &#145;first-class sea officer who rose to command a Grand Fleet cruiser squadron. He was, however, not gifted with much brain&#146;  (Marder, 2.16). However, in June 1925, he became commander-in-chief, China station, with his flag in the <i>Hawkins</i>, and showed a great deal of skill and judgement in handling difficult situations during the advance of the Chinese nationalist armies. At an incident in Wanhsien (Wanxian) in September 1926, the &#145;admirable restraint imposed upon the British seamen&#146; by Alexander-Sinclair was said to be &#145;appreciated by impartial observers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 14 Nov 1945, 7). In October 1926 he was promoted to the full rank of admiral and returned to the United Kingdom in 1927 to become commander-in-chief at the Nore. He relinquished his command in May 1930 and became first and principal aide-de-camp to George V. At the end of the year he was placed on the retired list on attaining the age of sixty-five. On his retirement he was promoted GCB.<br>
<br>A &#145;dour red-haired Scot from the wilds of Caithness, with a scrub-hammock face&#146;  (Marder, 2.40), Alexander-Sinclair, during his naval career of more than fifty years, received several foreign decorations, including the American DSM, the French Croix de Guerre, and was appointed a commander in the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He died at his home, Dunbeath Castle, Caithness, on 13 November 1945.<br>
