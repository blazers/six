<span class="headword">Polewheele,  E.</span>  (1651?&#150;1691?), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, may have been the Elizabeth Polwhele who was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22484/', "Theophilus Polwhele (d. 1689)")</script>, vicar of Tiverton and later a nonconformist minister&#151;a somewhat startling identification, though no other has been offered. Her birth date can be approximated from his first marriage in May 1650. This Elizabeth Polwhele married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16878/', "Stephen Lobb (d. 1699)")</script>, a nonconformist minister who became a prominent ecclesiastical figure in the 1680s. They had a son, the first of five known children, on 17 August 1678, having presumably long since given up playwriting. The funeral sermon for Lobb's wife, preached by Samuel Slater, and published in 1691, unfortunately contains no personal details of her life. The identification thus remains tentative.<br>
<br>Whoever E. Polewheele may have been, she was among the first women to write for the professional stage in England. (Her contemporaries were the obscure Frances Boothby, author of <span class="italic">Marcelia</span>, 1669, and Aphra Behn, whose <span class="italic">Forc'd Marriage</span> appeared about September 1670.) In her dedication of <span class="italic">The Frolicks</span> to Prince Rupert (signed E. Polewheele), the author describes herself as &#145;an unfortunate young woman &hellip; haunted with poetic devils&#146;, and says:<blockquote>I question not but I shall be taxed for writing a play so comical, but those that have ever seen my <span class="italic">Faithful Virgins</span> and my <span class="italic">Elysium</span> will justify me a little for writing this. I am young, no scholar, and what I write I write by nature, not by art.</blockquote>The title of the lost <span class="italic">Elysium</span> suggests an allegorical masque. <span class="italic">The Faithful Virgins</span> survives as an anonymous manuscript (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. poet. 195). On folio 49<i>r</i> appears the notation, &#145;This Tragedy apoynted to be acted by the dukes Company of Actors only leaving out what was Cross'd by Henry Herbert&#146; (master of the revels), and it was presumably performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields about 1670. An old-fashioned play in clanking rhyme, it is a throwback to popular types of the 1620s and 1630s, filled with <i>pr&eacute;cieux</i> sentiment. Brought up to date with witches reminiscent of Davenant's version of <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, it ends in a contrived bloodbath.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Frolicks, or, The Lawyer Cheated</span> (dated 1671 by the author in Cornell MSS Bd. Rare P P77) is a more successful enterprise, juggling four distinct plot lines. Sir William Meanwell lives in terror of being cuckolded by his young country wife. Lady Meanwell's sister, Faith, is seduced by Lord Courtall, a married rake who is assisted by Procreate, a French bawd. The witty Clarabell marries the rakish and bankrupt Rightwit, tricking her lawyer father. Two other suitors marry masked women, thinking that they are marrying Clarabell. The crudely constructed, bawdy play is a cross between 1660s &#145;gay couple&#146; courtship comedy and 1670s sex comedy. Unpublished until 1977, the play was clearly intended for performance; whether it was ever staged is not known. An ambitious if derivative writer, Polewheele was again aiming to exploit a theatrical trend. Whatever ended her career, she was unquestionably one of the first three women to have an original play professionally staged in London.<br>
