<span class="headword">Muir family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1849&#150;1992), <span class="occ">textile, tea, and general merchants</span>, was brought to prominence by <a name="cosubject_48942"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Muir</span>, first baronet  (1828&#150;1903)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 8 December 1828 at Hutchesontown, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, the son of James Muir (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1864), a cotton trader, and his wife, Elizabeth Brown (<i>c</i>.1809&#150;1874), a descendant of James Finlay (1727&#150;1790), who about 1765 had founded a textile exporting business. John Muir was educated at Glasgow high school, then briefly at Glasgow University, and joined James Finlay &amp; Co. in 1849, at the same time as his first cousin, Hugh Brown Muir (1828&#150;<i>c</i>.1908), son of John Muir of Kilmarnock.<br>
<br>The company which James Finlay had founded was expanded by his son Kirkman Finlay (1773&#150;1842), then passed to his grandsons who left its management in other hands. The numerous family partners were uninterested in change and exports were stagnant. John Muir was brought in to revitalize the business. Finlays absorbed Wilson, Kay &amp; Co., another piece-goods exporter, and in 1854 purchased offices in West Nile Street, Glasgow. In 1861 John and Hugh Muir became junior partners, each holding two of the total of forty-five shares, the rest being held by another junior and five senior partners. John Muir married in 1860 Margaret Morrison, eldest daughter of Alexander Kay, one of those seniors, and they raised four sons and six daughters. After his marriage John systematically eliminated the other partners, inducing them to retire or deliberately disagreeing with them, earning himself in Glasgow business circles the covert nickname of the Cuckoo. By 1870 John and Hugh dominated those remaining, namely Alexander Kay and two elderly Finlay relatives, and by 1883 John had become sole proprietor, with two junior non-voting partners. In that year Archibald Buchan, the last of the old Finlay family, tried but failed to obtain a legal injunction to prevent Muir trading under the name of James Finlay &amp; Co.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 had obliged Finlays to seek alternative sources of cotton. Their two large Scottish mills, at Deanston in Perthshire and Catrine in Ayrshire, each with nearly 1000 hands, came to a standstill. In 1861 Hugh Muir made the first of two visits to India in search of the high-quality raw cotton that had eluded Kirkman Finlay's agents in 1816. At the same time he investigated piece-goods sales in Singapore and Batavia, but finding that Chinese traders operated on extremely small margins, he advised against expanding into those already overstocked markets. In 1865 he re-established a Bombay office and was enthusiastic about the prospects of Indian trade; in 1870 a Calcutta office was reopened, and in 1871 Hugh opened a small London office. There were close links with Samuel Smith MP (1836&#150;1906), a leading cotton broker in Liverpool and also related to the Finlay family.<br>
<br>Existing friction between the cousins came to a head when John, a member of the Free Church of Scotland, dismissed a senior employee for playing chess on the sabbath day, which Hugh, a member of the Kirk of Scotland, considered unjust. In December 1873 Hugh left the partnership and set up Hugh Brown Muir &amp; Co., East India merchants, an independent business in the City of London. He died, probably in London, about 1908.<br>
<br>John Muir made the first of seven visits to Calcutta in 1871, setting up Finlay, Muir &amp; Co. as a private business to act as agent for his own ventures, while the Glasgow firm continued to act as home agent and to export piece-goods, grey-cloth, and yarns to Bombay and Calcutta. The first of these &#145;rupee companies&#146; registered in India was a jute press, followed in 1873 by a jute mill. Their foundation marked Muir's move into new products. Also in 1873 he moved into the infant tea industry, starting with the Calcutta agency for two small tea estates in northern India, then buying up other estates as they came on to the market. He was one of the first to realize that tea plantations would pay best when consolidated into large centrally administered groups under tight financial control, a management pattern later adopted throughout the industry. Muir floated the private North and South Sylhet Tea companies in 1883, both of which yielded large dividends. In 1896, now endowed with estates throughout the subcontinent, they were amalgamated under Muir as the Glasgow-registered Consolidated Tea and Lands Ltd. In 1894 Muir bought a large tract of high-altitude virgin jungle in the southern Indian state of Travancore and floated the very successful Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd, which included Darjeeling properties. A branch in Ceylon followed, with tea and rubber estates. Muir exercised a close supervision of the Calcutta office which managed these estates, with weekly reports and instructions passing between Glasgow and Calcutta.<br>
<br>Two other tea companies were registered in Glasgow, their purpose being to bypass the traditional London tea sales and reach directly to new outlets in America, Canada, and Russia&#151;another bold innovation on Muir's part. He set up London warehouses at Orient Dock, established his own tea-brokers and tea-tasters, and owned controlling interests in a tea-packeting and confectionery concern. By the 1890s Muir was the world's major stakeholder in the growing and marketing of tea.<br>
<br>Muir invested heavily in capital developments, especially in southern India and Ceylon, building roads and railways, putting in hydro-electric schemes and telephone systems. He was a harsh employer, both to his Indian labour force and to the young British&#151;mainly Scottish&#151;planters and &#145;jute-wallahs&#146; whom he recruited, and then had to replace when they fell victim to malaria. Salaries were small and leave infrequent; no wife's passage was paid until 1924, and a planter received a larger allowance for his essential horse than he did for a wife. But &#145;a berth in Finlays&#146; was sought after, and Finlays always commanded a deep if inexplicable loyalty from employees. At his death Muir had some 90,000 employees on payrolls in Britain and the Indian subcontinent.<br>
<br>Muir's venture into indigo trading in the 1890s, when aniline dyes were already replacing vegetable dyes, was disastrous. Possibly he hoped thereby to acquire valuable land in upper India, but he reaped heavy losses. Another hard-fought battle was more successful. About the time Muir's tea plantations were becoming profitable, Charles Cayzer was attempting to set up a shipping line in Glasgow. Cayzer was introduced to Alexander Stephen of Linthouse, a shipbuilder, and to John Muir as financier. The three men, though they never learned to trust each other, did remarkably successful business together. In 1878 they entered an agreement to build two ships, which became the nucleus of the Clan Line, cargo carriers with some passenger accommodation. Muir stipulated that James Finlay &amp; Co. should hold all the Clan Line agencies east of Suez, and that his tea should be freighted at a favourable rate. By this time a second jute mill was producing a great quantity of gunny (burlap) for export. As the port of Calcutta became overcrowded, Muir advocated the primitive port of Chittagong in East Bengal as an alternative, taking the agency for the Bengal Coal Company, and he forced the Clan Line to serve this port from 1901 by offering huge cargoes of tea and jute. A series of boardroom struggles and deep disagreements marred what was, in fact, a successful partnership. Cayzer resented Muir's bullying tactics and he managed to beat off Muir's attempted take-over, gaining complete control of the Clan Line in 1898. The two men remained, however, mutually necessary to their individual concerns, and they expanded this co-operation into new ventures in South Africa and in the Far East.<br>
<br>All John Muir's children were born at their parents' town house, 6 Park Gardens, Glasgow. The two eldest sons, (Alexander) Kay Muir and James Finlay Muir, attended Glasgow high school and Glasgow University before being sent to Calcutta, where their parents wintered each year. The Muirs took a leading part in Calcutta society, were on friendly terms with the viceroy, and subscribed to local charities. The younger sons, John Buchanan Finlay Muir (<i>b</i>. 1876) and Matthew William Muir (1878&#150;1922), were also educated at Glasgow high school and sent out to India. John then went ranching in Wyoming and died young. Matthew, a keen rider, was killed on the hunting field.<br>
<br>With his Indian empire secured, John Muir turned his attention to civic affairs. He was elected a baillie of Glasgow town council in 1886 and three years later became lord provost (1889&#150;92), receiving a baronetcy in 1893. He was largely responsible for the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1888. Its &pound;55,000 surplus was the basis of the Kelvingrove Art Galleries Fund, to which Muir donated &pound;15,000. In 1891 he presided over the passing of the <span class="roman">City of Glasgow Act</span>, which by enlarging the municipal boundaries added nearly 10,000 citizens. Gas supplies were extended, and electricity&#151;for which Muir was an early enthusiast&#151;lit the streets. Several notable public buildings were erected during his tenure, and Muir and his wife held glittering public functions in the city chambers. In a popular farewell gesture Lady Muir entertained all the nurses from Glasgow's hospitals. In national politics Muir was a liberal, becoming an active Liberal Unionist after 1886. He was a JP and deputy lieutenant for both Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, and an honorary colonel of the 4th (volunteer battalion) Cameronian Scottish rifles.<br>
<br>When John Finlay, last of Kirkman's sons and a sleeping partner, died in 1873 Muir took over and rebuilt Deanston House, near one of his cotton mills in Perthshire. Lady Muir took a great interest in the welfare of the mill hands at Deanston and was a popular local figure. Muir was an elder of St George's United Presbyterian Church in Glasgow and of the Bridge of Teith Free Presbyterian Church at Deanston. He was a stern parent, trusting his grown-up sons only a little more than his former partners; he wrote to them on 18 October 1898, &#145;My advice to you both is to fall in <i>cordially</i> with <i>my</i> views and policy, even when you do not quite understand them&#146;  (Finlay archive). His daughters made good marriages into the gentry or the upper mercantile families of Glasgow. Muir undoubtedly sailed close to the wind in some of his financial dealings. He considered shareholders a necessary evil, and the boards of all his public companies were composed of his sons-in-law and other compliant relatives.<br>
<br>Sir John Muir suffered two strokes and died at Deanston House on 6 August 1903. Alexander and James Muir returned from Calcutta on receiving news of their father's first stroke in 1901 and took over direction as trustees, later successive chairmen.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_48943"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Alexander) Kay Muir</span>, second baronet  (1868&#150;1951)<span class="occ"></span>, left his mother in possession of Deanston House and bought the large adjoining estate of Blair Drummond. A less domineering man than his father, he nevertheless exercised tight control of James Finlay &amp; Co., modernizing it and converting his father's haphazard collection of companies into a private company, owned by members of the extended Muir family, with the tea and jute companies as wholly owned subsidiaries. In 1919 capital was increased to &pound;2 million and in 1923 it became a public limited liability company. The First World War brought reasonable profits from sales of those staples of warfare&#151;gunny for sandbags, khaki cotton cloth, and tea, though the British staff were depleted by military service and Blair Drummond House became a convalescent hospital. Sir Kay made shrewd private investments. Just before he retired from the chair in 1926, foreseeing possible political instability in the Indian empire, he instigated a new venture, sending planters from southern India and Ceylon to open the first large-scale tea plantations in Kenya, which under his brother's chairmanship quickly began to produce good teas. Sir Kay took a conventional interest in politics as a Liberal Unionist. His main interests were shooting and fishing.<br>
<br>Sir Kay had married in 1910 Grace Frances, daughter of John Adam Richard Newman of Newberry Manor, co. Cork, and widow of Major Henry Charles Windsor Villiers-Stuart of Dromana, co. Waterford; she died in 1920. His second marriage was on 17 March 1924 at Brompton Oratory, Knightsbridge, to the Catholic twenty-year-old Nadejda Constanza Irenea Garilla Euphrosyne, eldest daughter of Dmitry Stancioff, former premier of Bulgaria, then Bulgarian minister in London. The marriage was a very happy one; Lady Nadejda's cosmopolitan background, united to Sir Kay's hospitality and sporting interests, made Blair Drummond the scene of notable house parties at which King Boris of Bulgaria was frequently present. Sir Kay died childless at Blair Drummond House on 4 June 1951; his wife died in 1957. The baronetcy and Blair Drummond estate devolved on his nephew John Harling Muir, the son of his late brother James Finlay Muir.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_48944"></a><span class="headword">James Finlay Muir</span>  (1870&#150;1948)<span class="occ"></span>, a man in his father's mould, was an autocrat rather than an innovator. He was ruthless, efficient, and, though much respected, more feared than loved. He married in 1909 Charlotte Escudier (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of John Harling Turner of Cessnock, Ayrshire. They resided at Braco Castle, Braco, Perthshire, where they raised two sons and a daughter. Charlotte's warmth, hospitality, and practical concern for the enormous Finlay workforce were much appreciated, though labour conditions improved as a result of legislation and the provision of better housing and health services, in which Finlays was slightly ahead of its competitors. Muir took a particular interest in developing the Kenya tea estates. When the slump of 1929&#150;30 severely affected tea and other plantation crops he supported the formation of the international tea quota.<br>
<br>In 1936 James Finlay Muir retired from the chair, which passed in turn to three unrelated chairmen and one grandson of the original Muir, Alexander McGrigor Muir. James Muir was a notable sportsman and enjoyed fine shooting at Braco. He and his wife played their part in local unionist politics and more widely in charitable and social affairs. He died at Braco Castle on 7 September 1948 and was buried privately on his estate. His widow lived on at Braco until her death in 1956.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_55158"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Harling Muir</span>, third baronet  (1910&#150;1994)<span class="occ"></span>, son of James Finlay Muir and his wife, Charlotte, was born on 17 November 1910 and educated at Stowe School. He served an apprenticeship on Finlay estates and at Calcutta from 1932 to 1940, followed by war service. He married in 1936 Elizabeth Mary, daughter of Frederick James Dundas of Cawthorne, Yorkshire; they had five sons and two daughters. Under his chairmanship from 1961 to 1975 Finlays divested itself of most of its Indian estates, retaining those in the adjacent subcontinent, and diversified into merchant banking and oil. Muir and his wife maintained the hospitable traditions of Blair Drummond and Braco, in both house and field, before turning over the house and estate to other uses and retiring to a smaller dwelling on the property. He died on 31 May 1994 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Richard James Kay Muir, fourth baronet.<br>
<br>The businesses operated by the Finlays and Muirs were on the whole extremely successful. The first Sir John Muir saw the colonial possibilities of primary crop production and revolutionized the tea industry by his integrated management of the various stages from plant to pot. The Muir family were paternalistic, stern, but respected employers, sustaining Victorian standards of probity and commanding loyalty and hard work from their vast workforce. Under the second Sir John Muir, Finlays was still an international company, mainly concerned with tea, though cotton textiles had been replaced by interests in North Sea oil; it remained, as it had been in the 1880s, the largest Scottish employer of overseas labour.<br>
