<span class="headword">Dicksee, Sir  Francis Bernard</span>  (1853&#150;1928), <span class="occ">historical genre and portrait painter</span>, was born in London on 27 November 1853. He was the elder son of the painter and illustrator Thomas Francis Dicksee (1819&#150;1895) and his wife, Eliza, the daughter of John Bernard, of Church Place, Piccadilly, London; his uncle John Robert Dicksee (1817&#150;1905) was also a painter. Dicksee was educated at the Revd George Henslow's school, Bloomsbury. He studied art with his father and from 1870 to 1875, at the Royal Academy Schools where he showed early promise, winning gold and silver medals. While still a student, Dicksee exhibited at the Society (later Royal Society) of British Artists in Suffolk Street in 1872; he began to exhibit regularly at the Royal Academy from 1876, when he showed <span class="italic">Elijah confronting Ahab and Jezebel in Naboth's Vineyard</span>, for which he had been awarded the Royal Academy's gold medal the previous year.<br>
<br>Dicksee's art was firmly rooted in Pre-Raphaelite concepts. Along with the illustrator and designer Walter Crane, the painter and designer Henry Holiday, and the painter J. W. Waterhouse, he was influenced by Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. The romantic, dreamlike visions that they espoused are epitomized by Dicksee's best-known work, <span class="italic">La Belle Dame sans Merci</span> (Bristol Art Gallery). Dicksee worked for some time under Holiday, who is perhaps best-known for his stained glass designs. He learned much from Holiday's interpretation of Pre-Raphaelitism and incorporated into his allegorical painting <span class="italic">Harmony</span> (exh. RA, 1877; Tate collection) a stained-glass window that could have been designed by Holiday. Equally, the organ case, seen on the left of the painting, might have been designed by William Morris's firm&#151;as Graham Reynolds points out, the scene is more akin to a St John's Wood studio than a medieval home. Dicksee was only twenty-four when this painting, which depicts a young woman in medieval costume playing an organ while a young man listens in rapt attention, met with great success at the Royal Academy exhibition. It was hailed as &#145;picture of the year&#146; and was purchased by the Chantrey trustees for 350 guineas. <span class="italic">The House Builders</span> (1880; priv. coll.), a large painting showing Sir William and Lady Welby-Gregory examining the plans and model of Denton Manor (dem.) built for them by A. W. Blomfield between 1879 and 1884, has itself been interpreted as a model of Victorian architectural patronage (see Physick and Derby, 152).<br>
<br>Early in his career Dicksee also illustrated books and magazines. The best-known of these are probably those for Longfellow's <span class="italic">Evangeline</span> (1882) and for Cassell's &#145;royal&#146; editions of Shakespeare: <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (1884) and <span class="italic">Othello</span> (1889). Several of his woodcut illustrations for the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span> are in the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
<br>In 1881 Dicksee was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1891 he became a full academician. His diploma work, <span class="italic">Startled</span>, was deposited in 1892. It depicts two nude girls&#151;one a child, the other an adolescent&#151;rushing from their bathing place, covered only by loosely held diaphanous robes, as a boat approaches. Dicksee had found a profitable niche, and continued to paint similarly titillating and ephemeral subjects for many years to come. He was not an innovative artist and frequently borrowed compositions from artists he knew and admired. Thus in a portrait of Lady Inverclyde of 1910 (Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery) he utilized a pose (albeit in reverse) derived from D. G. Rossetti's painting of Jane Morris, <span class="italic">Mariana</span> (Aberdeen Art Gallery), of forty years earlier. The exotically sensual women depicted in <span class="italic">The Magic Crystal</span> (1894; Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight) and <span class="italic">Passion</span> (or <span class="italic">Leila</span>) owe much to the powerful, almost masculine women who populate the paintings of Frederic Leighton. The ghostly figure in <span class="italic">A Reverie</span> (1895; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) was clearly inspired by Millais's earlier <span class="italic">Speak Speak</span> (1895; Tate collection).<br>
<br>Dicksee did not restrict himself to an imagined past but repeated his favoured composition, the interaction of two romantically paired figures, in modern moralizing scenes, such as <span class="italic">The Crisis</span> (1891; Melbourne Art Gallery) and <span class="italic">The Confession</span>, in which a young woman dressed in white is seen awaiting the reaction of her husband to whom she has confessed. Occasionally, however, he moved away from this format to paint large, intricate compositions, such as the dramatic <span class="italic">Funeral of a Viking</span> (1893; Manchester City Galleries).<br>
<br>Dicksee was a strident opponent of modern art. His retrogressive stance, however, did not adversely affect his popularity. In his own lifetime his paintings achieved high prices at auction&#151;the record for his work being set by <span class="italic">Too Late</span> (1883), bought for &pound;997 10<i>s</i>. at the A. Shuttleworth sale at Christies on 3 May 1890. In 1900 he won a gold medal at the Universal Exhibition, and the same year his painting entitled <span class="italic">The Two Crowns</span> (Tate collection) was purchased by the Chantrey trustees for &pound;2000. Even into the 1920s he continued to exhibit and sell sentimental, melodramatic paintings that had not changed significantly from his much earlier work, such as <span class="italic">The End of the Quest</span> (1921; Leighton House, London) and <span class="italic">This for Remembrance</span> (1924; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). Dicksee's romantic scenes found favour with his female audience and for a time he was also a fashionable portrait painter, especially for women, though towards the end of the century his melancholy style was eclipsed by John Singer Sargent's &#145;swagger&#146; school of portrait painting.<br>
<br>In 1924 Dicksee was elected president of the Royal Academy. He was knighted in 1925 and in the following year was nominated by the newly elected chancellor of Oxford University, Viscount Cave, for the honorary degree of DCL. He was created KCVO in 1927. He was a trustee of the British Museum and the National Portrait Gallery and president of the Artists' General Benevolent Association. He died, unmarried, on 17 October 1928, at the Cambridge Nursing Home, 4 Dorset Square, London. A retrospective selection of his works was included in the Royal Academy winter exhibition of 1933.<br>
