<span class="headword">Sinclair,  Elizabeth Margaret <span class="st"> [Betty]</span></span>  (1910&#150;1981), <span class="occ">trade unionist and communist</span>, was born on 3 December 1910 into a protestant working-class family at 44 Hooker Street in the Ardoyne district of north Belfast. Her father, Joseph Sinclair, a sawyer, worked in the Harland and Wolff shipyard while her mother, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turney, was a reeler in Ewart's linen mill. She and her two elder brothers and one younger sister were brought up as members of the Church of Ireland and she attended St Mary's Church of Ireland School on the Crumlin Road from the ages of four to thirteen. She stayed with an aunt in Leeds for a period from 1923 to 1925 where she finished her formal education and worked for a while in the printing trade. She returned to Belfast in 1925 and entered Ewart's mill to be trained as a reeler by her mother. Both her brothers were active trade unionists and the atmosphere in her home had reflected the cautious liberalism of her father, who discouraged his children's participation in popular Orange culture.<br>
<br>In 1931 Sinclair's brother Billy introduced her to the politics of the newly formed Revolutionary Workers' Groups (RWG) which were established in November 1930 to replace the Workers' Revolutionary Party as the Irish affiliate of the Communist International. Against the background of the great depression and the extremely high rates of unemployment in the city, she and other members of the Belfast RWG played a leading role in the outdoor relief protests in October 1932 when unemployed workers agitated for improvement in the payments provided by the local council for those employed in public work schemes. A large demonstration which was banned under the <span class="roman">Special Powers Act</span> led to confrontations with the police and serious violence during which two workers were killed by police gunfire. Sinclair spoke at meetings all over Belfast in support of the protests, an unprecedented development in a male-dominated movement where, even within the RWG, there was considerable hostility to female activism. It was at this time that she was briefly married, the marriage ending because of her husband's expectation that she would give up her political involvement. One sad result of her marriage was the death at birth of twins  (private information, Lynda Walker).<br>
<br>Sinclair was one of the founding members of the Communist Party of Ireland (CPI) when it was reconstituted in June 1933. Later that year she received an invitation to be a student at the International Lenin School in Moscow. She arrived in Moscow in January 1934 and remained there for eighteen months. The school judged that she possessed a &#145;correct political line on all questions&#146;  (McLoughlin, 78). There, during the period of high Stalinism, she internalized orthodox Marxism-Leninism and her loyalty to the Soviet Union would remain unshaken to the end. She returned to Belfast in July 1935 where she took up employment in the linen mills and was one of the linen trade unions' representatives on the Belfast Trades Council. She also witnessed the intense sectarian violence that wracked parts of the city in the summer of 1935 and she became acutely aware of how precarious even the most limited forms of working-class unity across the sectarian divide could be.<br>
<br>As world war approached, Irish communism was as unprepared for the Molotov&#150;Ribbentrop pact in 1939 as any national communist party. It faced peculiar problems in implementing the new policy of opposition to the &#145;imperialist war&#146; given the fact that it operated in the neutral Irish Free State as well as part of the United Kingdom. In 1940 Sinclair and Billy McCullough were sentenced to one and two years' imprisonment respectively for publishing an article in the CPI's paper, <span class="italic">Red Hand</span>, which was written by a republican at a time when the IRA was opposing the war and had entered into contacts with the Nazis. The sentences were reduced on appeal and Sinclair served two months in Armagh gaol. With the German attack on the Soviet Union, the CPI liquidated its organization in the neutral free state, while the new Communist Party of Northern Ireland (CPNI) put its militants in the forefront of the &#145;struggle against Fascism on the domestic front&#146;. The IRA was denounced for its pro-Nazi sympathies, leading to death threats against Sinclair and Billy McCullough, another leading Belfast communist. Strikes were opposed and the CPNI's stature rose dramatically on the back of the central role played by the USSR in the allied war effort. During the war Sinclair became a full-time party worker, as district organizer and also treasurer. She also worked in the party's bookshop in Church Lane in Belfast. The marked shift to the left in popular opinion throughout the UK was reflected in Belfast, where in the 1945 elections for the Stormont parliament, Sinclair polled 4100 votes in the Cromac constituency to the 8000 of her unionist opponents. Billy McCullough, the party secretary, got over 5000 votes in another east Belfast constituency, Bloomfield  (Morrissey, 126). The party itself had over 1000 members in Belfast. However, the arrival of the cold war, and the return of the &#145;national question&#146; to the forefront of Irish politics with the all-party anti-partition campaign launched in Dublin in 1949, saw much of this support and membership disappear.<br>
<br>In 1947, after a period working in the Communist Party bookshop in Bristol, Sinclair became secretary of the Belfast Trades Council, a position she held until her retirement in 1975. She played a role in a number of campaigns promoted by the CPNI ranging from opposition to atomic weapons and apartheid to the campaign to get an American passport for Paul Robeson. When the singer came to Belfast in the late 1950s he singled out the trades council and Betty Sinclair for thanks  (private information, Edwina Stewart). The trades council had taken an early lead in raising the issue of civil rights in Northern Ireland by establishing a link with the National Council of Civil Liberties in the late 1940s. Issues of discrimination in the allocation of houses by local authorities, the maintenance by the unionist regime of a ratepayers' franchise in local government elections, and the <span class="roman">Special Powers Act</span>, had long been raised by nationalist and republican opponents of the state. However, these issues were always subordinate to the traditional objective of the abolition of the Northern Ireland state. The subversive potential of the civil rights issue was that it side-stepped the &#145;national question&#146; and demanded instead simply that the citizens of Northern Ireland enjoy the same rights as those in the rest of the UK.<br>
<br>The first conference dealing with the civil rights issue was organized by the Belfast Trades Council in May 1965. When the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was established in April 1967 the main impetus came from the Wolfe Tone Society, a republican &#145;think-tank&#146; which was in the forefront of the attempt to develop a new strategy after the failure of the IRA's attempt to use &#145;armed struggle&#146; against the northern state between 1956 and 1962. Sinclair was on relatively good terms with the republican left and initially played a central role in NICRA, being elected chairman of its executive in 1968. However, she had reservations about the decision to take the campaign on to the streets of Northern Ireland. She opposed the decision to organize the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in August 1968. The predominant view in the NICRA's leadership reflected a facile use of the US civil rights model, ignoring the very different sectarian significance that marches had in Northern Ireland. Sinclair wanted to maintain the support of &#145;progressive&#146; sections of protestant opinion for the civil rights agenda. Unlike many of the ultra-left student elements of the burgeoning protest movement, she knew from her personal experience during the 1930s of the terrible danger of exacerbating traditional animosities. However, it was those who criticized her for &#145;reformism&#146; and &#145;Stalinism&#146; who had their way, with disastrous results. In 1969 she and three other of the moderates on the NICRA executive resigned in protest at its increasingly confrontational tactics.<br>
<br>The final decade of Sinclair's life coincided with Northern Ireland's descent into the frenzied violence of the &#145;troubles&#146;. She condemned the Provisional IRA's bombing campaign because of the damage it did to the twin causes to which she had dedicated her political life: working-class unity and a united Ireland. After her retirement from the trades council she went to Prague in 1976 as Irish representative on the editorial board of <span class="italic">World Marxist Review</span>. In 1979 she returned to Northern Ireland where she died on Christmas day 1981, suffocating from a fire in the bedroom of her pensioner's flat at 4A Willowbrook House, in the Cregagh district of east Belfast. At her funeral service on 30 December 1981, in the Belfast Co-operative Society funeral home on the Ravenhill Road, the obituary in the communist paper <span class="italic">Unity</span> noted, there were representatives of all Northern Irish political organizations with the exception of unionists, &#145;her life-long enemies&#146;. In fact her failure to engage sympathetically with unionism and loyalism was perhaps the major weakness of the Irish Marxist tradition she represented. She was buried with her parents in Carnmoney cemetery, Newtownabbey, co. Antrim. In his graveside oration, Michael O'Riordan, general secretary of the CPI, pointed to her time in Moscow at the International Lenin School as the key source of her qualities of resolution and resilience: &#145;Each visit since then made her often declare her agreement with the American, Lincoln Steffens, who exclaimed, &#147;I have seen the future and it works&#148;&#146;  (Stewart).<br>
