<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Koch,  Ludwig Karl</span>  (1881&#150;1974), <span class="occ">broadcaster and sound recordist</span>, was born on 13 November 1881 at Eschersheimer Landstrasse 20, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the second of the three children of Karl Theodor Koch, businessman, and his wife, Auguste Hess. Ludwig Koch's parents, both of whom were Jews, were enthusiastic music-lovers who introduced him into Frankfurt's rich musical scene where, while still a boy violinist, he was admitted to Clara Schumann's music circle. Later Koch studied singing, subsequently enjoying a short though successful career as a concert singer which was ended by the outbreak of the First World War. On 30 May 1912 Koch married Nellie Sylvia Herz, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ganz (1892&#150;1973), and they had a son and a daughter. His fluent French led to Koch's joining military intelligence early in the war, where he gained a special expertise in matters pertaining to prisoners of war. On the signing of the armistice in 1918, he was appointed chief delegate for repatriation for the French-occupied zone of Germany. However, he gradually resumed his participation in musical activities, giving up his work for the German government in 1925. In 1928 he was invited by the German subsidiary of Electric and Musical Industries (EMI) to organize a cultural branch of the gramophone industry; this coincided with a revival of his childhood interest in animals.<br>
<br>In 1889, when Koch was eight, his father had presented him with an Edison phonograph and a box of wax cylinders purchased at the Leipzig fair; so Ludwig commenced recording the voices of his numerous pets. His new responsibility for the development of cultural gramophone recording enabled him to begin, from 1929, the recording of animal sounds in earnest, using up-to-date equipment. Among several innovations, he conceived the idea of the sound-book: attaching gramophone records to an otherwise normal illustrated book.<br>
<br>Being a Jew, Koch's life under the Nazi regime became increasingly intolerable. Following confrontations with minor officials, he decided early in 1936 to flee to Britain. He was obliged to leave some of his precious recordings behind, but, encouraged by Sir Julian Huxley, he succeeded in interesting the ornithologist and publisher Harry Witherby in his plan for a sound-book of British wild birds. By a fortunate coincidence, E. M. (Max) Nicholson had been commissioned by Witherby to write a book on British birdsongs and he readily offered to collaborate with Koch and make it a sound-book. Koch immediately set about recording birds in the English countryside with tremendous enthusiasm. Before the end of 1936 <span class="italic">Songs of Wild Birds</span> was published, followed by two other sound-books by 1938.<br>
<br>Early in the Second World War, Huxley suggested to Koch that he offer his services to the BBC, and by the end of the war his unmistakable voice accompanying his sound recordings had become universally familiar. His extraordinary, yet attractive and rather musical, Germanic pronunciation of English undoubtedly accounted in some measure for his popularity on the radio. As a broadcaster, Koch became especially associated with the natural history radio programmes emanating from Bristol from 1946 onwards. In 1948 the BBC purchased his entire collection of animal recordings and he joined the staff to make more of them by undertaking fieldwork throughout the British Isles. For several years after his retirement in 1951 from the BBC he continued to undertake expeditions to record wildlife sounds, including one to Iceland when he was seventy-one. His entire collection is now housed in the National Sound Archive at the British Library.<br>
<br>To the radio listeners of the 1940s and 1950s, Ludwig Koch, who was appointed MBE in 1960, was the man who brought the sounds of the countryside into their homes in a way that had been impossible before. He was a happy, humorous character whose magnetic radio personality played a significant role in heightening the British public's appreciation of wildlife. On 4 May 1974, aged ninety-two, he died peacefully in Harrow, Middlesex; he was cremated at Pinner cemetery, Harrow, on 13 May.<br>
