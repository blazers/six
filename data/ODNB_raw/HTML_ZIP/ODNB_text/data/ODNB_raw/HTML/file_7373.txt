<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Day,  William</span>  (1529&#150;1596), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was the son of Richard Day of Newport, Shropshire, and Agnes Osborne. He was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge, where his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7364/', "George Day")</script>, future bishop of Chichester, was provost between 1538 and 1547. He was admitted scholar on 14 August 1545 and fellow on 15 August 1548, graduating BA in early 1550 and proceeding MA in 1553.<br>
<br>William Day's conversion to protestantism caused a serious breach between himself and his brother. When he applied for money to buy books and other necessities the request was sharply refused on the grounds that George was not prepared to assist anyone who was not a member of the true church. Day nevertheless retained his fellowship under Mary and during Cardinal Pole's visitation of the university in January 1557 he appears to have entertained &#145;all the thirteen seniors&#146; to dinner at his chamber in King's and to have discharged the part of &#145;Christmas king&#146;  (Lamb, 197). Later that year he was chosen proctor.<h2>
<a name="EarlyprefermentunderElizabeth"></a>Early preferment under Elizabeth</h2>Day's potential as one of the leaders of a revived protestant regime was at once recognized by Elizabeth's government. He resigned his fellowship in 1559 and, although still a layman, received letters patent, <i>sede vacante</i>, for the prebend of Ampleforth in York Minster on 7 November 1559, succeeding the deprived Alban Langdale, and for the archdeaconry of Nottingham on 23 December 1559, succeeding the deprived suffragan bishop of Hull, Robert Pursglove. He was ordained deacon by Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, on 24 March 1560, giving his age as twenty-nine, and priest seven days later by Richard Davies, bishop of St Asaph, acting on Grindal's behalf. He was elected a fellow of Eton later in 1560.<br>
<br>Following the death of the provost of Eton, William Bill, on 15 July 1561 the conservative majority within the fellowship made a futile attempt to thwart the royal prerogative by electing Richard Bruerne as his successor. The election was inevitably declared invalid and Grindal submitted to William Cecil a list of fourteen suitable candidates, many of whom had been in exile under Mary. It was, however, Day who was elected by the fellows on 18 October 1561. He was formally admitted on 5 January 1562. Because of Elizabeth's well-advertised dislike of clerical marriage it has been traditionally assumed that it was Day's celibacy that determined his selection but there is no evidence that the queen took a personal interest in the appointment. The factor which is likely to have most influenced Cecil and the privy council is his lifelong association with Eton and King's. Nor did Day remain celibate. His wife, Elizabeth, whom he married <i>c</i>.1565, was one of the five daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1442/', "William Barlow")</script>, bishop of Chichester, who all married bishops.<br>
<br>In 1562 Day proceeded BTh at Cambridge. His radical views were at the same time forcibly expressed during his early months as provost. The college chapel was transformed with iconoclastic thoroughness. The images were removed, the niches in which they had stood plastered over, and the imposing rood screen demolished. If Sir John Harington is to be believed, he was held in great affection by his scholars. Harington described him as affable and courteous, pleasant in conversation &#145;yet allwayes sufficiently retaining his gravitie&#146;. He had &#145;a good and familiar fashion of preaching &hellip; apte to edifie, and easie to remember&#146;  (Harington, 2.95&#150;7).<br>
<br>On 13 January 1563 Day preached the sermon that opened the first convocation of the reign since the parliamentary settlement of 1559, on the text &#145;Feed the flock of God which is among you&#146;. Thereafter he was one of those members of the lower house who attempted to do away with the Catholic ceremonies retained in the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. When a modified form of their proposals, summarized in a series of six articles, was eventually accepted for debate they were defeated by a majority of one after proxy votes had been taken into consideration.<br>
<br>At the end of 1563 Day clashed with the French ambassador, Paul de Foix, who had been consigned to Eton under a form of house arrest in retaliation for the French king's similar treatment of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, English ambassador in Paris. De Foix resented the strictness of college discipline and when on 30 December he was refused the keys for the exit of two guests after the gates had been locked he burst into the provost's chamber, sword in hand, and demanded their surrender. Day complied but not unnaturally dispatched a formal complaint to William Cecil, expatiating on the unacceptable behaviour of the ambassador's entourage and describing their excesses in great detail.<h2>
<a name="DeanofWindsor"></a>Dean of Windsor</h2>On 12 May 1565 Day received letters patent for the canonry at St George's Chapel, Windsor, formerly occupied by Richard Bruerne. Perhaps for that reason he resigned the archdeaconry of Nottingham in June 1565 and the prebend of Ampleforth at the same time or shortly afterwards. He continued to receive special marks of favour from the government and to discharge the duties that went with them. On 11 August 1569 he was granted letters patent for the valuable rectory of Lavenham, Suffolk, and in November 1570 Matthew Parker, archbishop of Canterbury, successfully recommended his appointment as an ecclesiastical commissioner &#145;for some causes necessary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 370). In 1572 he was promoted both dean of the Chapel Royal and, on 23 June, dean of Windsor, resigning his canonry but remaining provost of Eton.<br>
<br>The first historian of Windsor College, Thomas Frith, writing within living memory of Day's tenure, dismissed him as a rapacious and unpopular dean who reduced the revenues by overmuch leasing of the estates. He cited a remark by Lord Chancellor Ellesmere that &#145;Dean Day had excellent skill to creep out of the law&#146;  (Ollard, 44). Historians of ancient foundations are, however, notoriously apt to concern themselves with stewardship of estates, and it is possible that Ellesmere was in fact expressing a grudging admiration for Day's ability to preserve, rather than squander, the resources of the deanery by resisting the petitions of importunate suitors for easy pickings from its assets.<br>
<br>Be that as it may, only one serious incident in Day's 24-year sojourn at Windsor survives in the public records. In December 1575, Elizabeth having commanded him to &#145;permitt no innovacions&#146;, he prohibited the catechizing of children in the churches over which, as dean, he exercised ordinary jurisdiction. He was rapped over the knuckles by Cecil (now Lord Burghley), who with consummate diplomacy observed that, catechizing being formally authorized by the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, Day must in some way have interpreted the queen's &#145;spech or admonicion to a wrong sense&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/172/1.i).<br>
<br>In 1580 Day served as prolocutor of convocation and was one of many theologians who disputed with Edmund Campion before his execution in 1581. He and Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, thereafter wrote <span class="italic">A true report of the disputation with E. Campion, whereunto is joyned a true report of the other three dayes conferences</span> (1583).<h2>
<a name="Bishopinwaiting15681596"></a>Bishop in waiting, 1568&#150;1596</h2>The chief interest of Day's long career is his failure to secure a bishopric until the last months of his life. As early as 1568 his brother-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20976/', "William Overton")</script>, future bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, suggested that he succeed their late father-in-law, William Barlow, at Chichester, a diocese in urgent need of protestant evangelization. In March 1570 Archbishop Parker advised Cecil that Day was &#145;meetest&#146; of the available candidates to follow Grindal as bishop of London  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 360). The post, however, went to Edwin Sandys. There is no evidence that Day's claims were seriously considered when in 1577 Sandys was elevated to York and John Aylmer promoted in his stead. Yet when in March 1580 Aylmer suggested himself unsuccessfully for vacant Winchester, it was Day whom he recommended as his successor.<br>
<br>At the beginning of his primacy in 1583 John Whitgift renewed the proposal that Day be consecrated to London if Aylmer were to be translated (on this occasion to Ely). After the death of Richard Barnes, bishop of Durham, on 24 August 1587 Burghley vigorously espoused Day's candidacy for the palatine see, in the process opposing that of yet another of his brothers-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18342/', "Tobie Matthew")</script>, dean of Durham. By the end of November, Burghley had secured Elizabeth's approval of his elevation but, as Day reminded Robert Cecil seven years later, &#145;the finishing of it was some while put off&#146; when in December Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, returned from the Low Countries: subsequently Day's nomination was &#145;clean overthrown&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 5.8). In the months that followed Leicester oscillated between the claims of Matthew and those of John Piers, bishop of Salisbury. Deadlock ensued and the disposal of Durham had not been resolved when Leicester died in September 1588. In January 1589 the proposal to translate Aylmer to Ely and promote Day in his place was yet again revived, without success. If Burghley was still privately hoping to secure Day's elevation to Durham he was finally thwarted when Matthew Hutton was elected on 9 June 1589.<br>
<br>When Aylmer died in June 1594 London was finally within Day's grasp: although now sixty-five he remained Burghley's preferred candidate. Day appointed his son-in-law, Thomas Ridley, former headmaster of Eton, to conduct negotiations on his behalf but in the power struggle which followed Burghley and his son Robert Cecil made little headway. London was bestowed on Richard Fletcher, bishop of Worcester, whose candidacy had the backing of Leicester's stepson and political heir, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, and (after his failure to secure any support for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Richard Bancroft) of Archbishop Whitgift.<br>
<br>Essex and Whitgift were nevertheless anxious to see Day elevated to the bench at this juncture since another of Essex's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, Henry Savile, had his sights firmly set on the provostship of Eton. They therefore suggested Day as Fletcher's successor at Worcester. Burghley, however, once again proposed him for Durham, soon to become vacant with the translation to York of Matthew Hutton. Day formally accepted Durham in a guarded letter of thanks to Robert Cecil on 14 October 1594, dryly observing (as quoted above) that a previous offer of the palatine see had failed in 1587. Perhaps he was already aware that other forces were at work. During the clandestine manoeuvres which followed it seems that, behind his father's back, Robert Cecil entered into secret alliance with Essex to secure Elizabeth's approval of Tobie Matthew. With extreme reluctance Day accepted the bishopric of Worcester instead. Both appointments were announced in council on 1 December.<br>
<br>Although Thomas Ridley twice assured Robert Cecil that he was resolved to proceed to election Day formally withdrew his acceptance of Worcester on 5 January 1595. On 14 January, informed that Elizabeth was displeased at this display of <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</i>, Day explained himself more fully to Robert Cecil. He had made enquiries into his likely income from Worcester and concluded that &#145;if I should take it, it would utterly beggar me&#146;. He had served the queen at Eton and Windsor &#145;the greatest part of my life and never sought any further preferment&#146;. He therefore asked that Cecil petition Elizabeth to allow him to remain where he had &#145;been bred and brought up (child and man) these forty years&#146; rather than, in old age, to be forced &#145;to seek another country, a strange air, new acquaintance and another living without sufficient maintenance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 5.84).<h2>
<a name="BishopofWinchester"></a>Bishop of Winchester</h2>Yet when another of his brothers-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30128/', "William Wickham")</script>, bishop of Winchester, died unexpectedly in June 1595, Day at once succeeded him. In stark contrast to the power struggles of 1594&#150;5 there is not a hint in the records that his candidacy was in any way challenged and indeed he later wrote to Burghley and Robert Cecil that &#145;you two alone have brought me to the place I am in&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 6.64). Day was elected by the Winchester chapter on 3 November 1595 and consecrated on 25 January 1596.<br>
<br>Day was instantly confronted with a demand for an episcopal lease on behalf of Sir Francis Carew, for whom Robert Cecil had been attempting to extract some <i>douceur</i> from the late Bishop Wickham. Although Day refused on the usual grounds that he would be despoiling the see to the prejudice of his successors, he was within weeks pressured into offering a lease worth &pound;1000, but only for twenty-one or thirty-one years. Dissatisfied, Carew refused it. Meanwhile, claiming with much melodramatic detail that unless the necessary formalities were expedited he was doomed to financial disaster, Day fought hard for restoration of his temporalities and for favourable terms of composition for Winchester's hefty tax liability. Here he was successful, obtaining on 6 May a royal warrant whereby he received five years to pay off his first fruits, the first instalment not falling due until thirteen months after he had become entitled to his revenues.<br>
<br>Day died on the following 20 September. Thomas Ridley loyally wrote that he &#145;left behind him a very good remembrance&#146; in Winchester &#145;for his great housekeeping, painfulness in preaching and diligence in executing his duty in all sorts under her Majesty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 6.408). Perhaps for that reason Elizabeth granted his executors half the profits of the bishopric due at Michaelmas 1596 for the discharging of his funeral expenses.<br>
<br>Day had made a short will on 11 September 1596, from which it would appear that he had already disposed of most of his assets to his family. There were only token bequests to his wife, two sons, and three married daughters Susan Cox, Rachel Barker, and &#145;Ridley&#146;&#151;Alice, wife of Thomas Ridley. The only substantial legacy was &pound;500 to his unmarried daughter Elizabeth, presumably as a marriage portion. No servants were remembered and there were no charitable bequests. His sons Thomas and William were granted probate as joint executors on 2 October.<br>
<br>Almost nothing survives from Day's pen apart from the volume on Campion. Notes taken from his sermons exist in manuscript in the university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge and a description of the St George's day festivities at Westminster is extant  (BL, Harley MS 304, fol. 144).<h2>
<a name="ThefailureofWilliamDay"></a>The failure of William Day</h2>The frequent recommendations for Day's further promotion by Parker, Burghley, Aylmer, and Whitgift are clear-cut evidence that he lacked neither energy, administrative ability, nor the queen's goodwill. Why then did he remain bishop of London in waiting for a full quarter of a century after 1570 and twice fail to capture the bishopric of Durham? The steady opposition of Leicester, and then Essex, is a possibility but the ultimate key to Day's failure to prosper perhaps lay in his own temperament. At one point during the struggle for Durham in 1587&#150;8 Tobie Matthew&#151;a consummate ecclesiastical diplomat who on occasion rashly threw diplomacy to the winds&#151;observed to Sir Francis Walsingham's secretary that &#145;my brother Daye is a good wise man, setting as muche by wealth as by honor, and his old Master [Burghley] no very toughe savior in such maters, when he is well incountred with reason&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Titus B.vii, fol. 424<i>r</i>). Indeed, in 1594 Day's mandarin decision to negotiate for the bishopric of London through the agency of Thomas Ridley seems to have irritated Burghley, who evidently felt that he was not doing enough to win other friends for himself at court. There followed his bold, and potentially fatal, refusal of Worcester. Was it, in sum, Day's apparently patrician stance, in a court where churchmen were expected to be respectful to their Erastian masters, that so frequently cost him promotion? When it came at last it was surely as the result of Burghley's fierce determination to demonstrate his loyalty, in his final months of power, to an old and often disappointed friend.<br>
