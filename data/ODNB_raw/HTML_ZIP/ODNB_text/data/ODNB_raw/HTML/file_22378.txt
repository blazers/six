<span class="headword">Plegemund <span class="st"> [Plegmund]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 914), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, re-established the authority of the see of Canterbury after the misfortunes of the late ninth century and saw through a programme of reform, whereby each future shire in Wessex had its own see. Plegemund was of Mercian descent, and he may have lived as a hermit on the island of Plemstell, in what is now Cheshire, before entering King Alfred's court, where he was one of four scholars who helped to translate Gregory the Great's <span class="italic">Cura pastoralis</span> from Latin into English. The delay of one and a half years between the death of Archbishop &AElig;thelred in 888 and the consecration of Plegemund in 890 supports later accounts that he was only offered the see of Canterbury after Grimbald, a Flemish monk and scholar, had refused it. Plegemund's indigenous background may have given him the confidence to take over this heavy responsibility, for the see of Canterbury was then at its nadir. His training as a scholar meant that he was also well equipped to master the tortuous aspects of papal politics necessary to re-establish the see's authority.<br>
<br>Plegemund's most prominent achievement was in the establishment of new sees at Crediton, Ramsbury, Sherborne, and Wells between 909 and 918. Ecclesiastical factions fighting in Rome for control of the papal see meant that it was vital for him to gain the approval of the newly elected pope, Sergius III (<i>r</i>. 904&#150;11), for this proposed reorganization of the English church. Sergius III had recently annulled all of the acts of Pope Formosus, who had granted Plegemund his pallium. This made it possible that Plegemund's actions would not be recognized by future generations. Plegemund travelled to Rome in 908, probably to obtain confirmation of his authority and also to secure the agreement of the pontiff to the proposed subdivision of the two ancient sees of Wessex into a number of smaller bishoprics. The success of his mission from the point of view of the Roman authorities can perhaps be inferred by the fact that he returned to Canterbury with the relics of St Blaise.<br>
<br>The account in a document from the later tenth century that Plegemund consecrated seven new bishops on a single day is fictitious; and the dates for the establishment of the new sees can only be dated generally between his return from Rome and the appointment of W&aelig;stan as bishop of Sherborne in 918. Under this programme the regions comprising the future shires of Devon and Cornwall (diocese of Crediton), Dorset (Sherborne), Somerset (Wells), Wiltshire (Ramsbury), and Hampshire (Winchester) each received their own bishop.<br>
<br>Plegemund's interests also extended to playing a role in the development of the new English state and its urban communities. He attended the formal councils which Edward the Elder held in 901, 903, 904, and 909 at Southampton, Winchester, and other unspecified centres, which both Mercian and West Saxon bishops attended. In 898 he was involved in a meeting with King Alfred and Ealdorman &AElig;thelred which set out new river frontages in the modern day area of Queenshythe in the city of London. In 909 he dedicated the tall tower at the New Minster, Winchester. Plegemund played this full role in the renewal of urban and political landscapes without neglecting his scholarly duties. At Canterbury under his rule the Latin script written there improved notably (in contrast to the poor work produced under his two predecessors since the 850s), with the introduction of a new handsome rounded script with relatively few Kentish misspellings.<br>
<br>Plegemund died on 2 August 914. He may not have been as holy and as scholarly as Alfred's first choice for the archbishopric, but he served the English church well in its renewal after the disruptions of the viking age on international, national, urban, and scholarly levels. He was the first archbishop to visit Rome in nearly a century and his reforms led the way for Oda and others to introduce ecclesiastical reorganization into the Danelaw.<br>
