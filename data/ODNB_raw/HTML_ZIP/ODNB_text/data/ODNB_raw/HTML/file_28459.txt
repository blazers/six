<span class="headword">Waley,  Simon Waley</span>  (1827&#150;1875), <span class="occ">composer and banker</span>, was born on 23 August 1827 at Stockwell, London, the younger son of Solomon Jacob Waley (<i>d</i>. 1864) and his wife, Rachel Hort; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28458/', "Jacob Waley (1818&#150;1873)")</script> was his elder brother. He became a prominent member of the London stock exchange, with offices at 2 Angel Court from 1858 to 1873, and at 13 Copthall Street from 1873 to 1875, and a leading figure in the Jewish community during the period of the emancipation of the Jews from civil disabilities. He was very interested in international traffic, and at the age of sixteen he wrote his first letter on the subject to the <span class="italic">Railway Times</span>. He contributed at length to the correspondence columns of <span class="italic">The Times</span> under the signature W. London, advocating Boulogne as the postal route between England and Europe, and he sent a series of letters on &#145;A tour in Auvergne&#146; to the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in 1858, which were later incorporated into John Murray's <span class="italic">Handbook for Travellers in France</span>.<br>
<br>Waley was a highly gifted musician as well as a shrewd man of business. He began to compose before he was eleven years old, and many of his childhood compositions showed great promise. His first published work, <span class="italic">L'arpeggio</span>, a piano study, appeared in 1848. He had piano lessons from Ignaz Moscheles, William Sterndale Bennett, and George Alexander Osborne, and lessons in theory and composition from William Horsley and Bernhard Molique. In addition to being a brilliant pianist&#151;he performed regularly at concerts of the Amateur Musical Society conducted by Henry Leslie&#151;Waley was a prolific composer. His published compositions include a piano concerto (op. 16), two piano trios, in B[flat] and G minor (op. 15 and op. 20), marches and caprices for piano, and many songs, including &#145;Angels' voices&#146; and &#145;Sing on, sing on, ye little birds&#146;. He also wrote orchestral pieces, which were not published. One of his finest works is a setting of <span class="roman">Psalms 117 and 118</span> for the synagogue service.<br>
<br>Waley married Anna, the daughter of P. J. Salomons, and they had eight children. He died at his home, 22 Devonshire Place, Marylebone, London, on 30 December 1875, and was buried at the Jewish cemetery, Ball's Pond.<br>
