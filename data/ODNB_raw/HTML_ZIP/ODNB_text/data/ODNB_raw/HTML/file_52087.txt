<span class="headword">Gray,  Gordon Joseph</span>  (1910&#150;1993), <span class="occ">cardinal and Roman Catholic archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh</span>, was born on 10 August 1910 at 143 Leith Walk, Leith, the second son and third of the four children of Francis William Gray (1870&#150;1950), mechanical engineer, and his wife, Angela Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Oddy (1882/3&#150;1970), teacher. His father, born in Banffshire, had come to Edinburgh in 1887, was apprenticed to an engineering firm and rose to be managing director. His mother, educated by Ursuline sisters in Edinburgh, taught in a Catholic primary school in the city. Gray was educated at Holy Cross Academy, near his home. Religious influences on him came from home and school and from his uncle, John Allan Gray, a priest in the diocese. Gray decided to be a priest but it was diocesan policy not to accept relatives of a priest already serving. Accordingly he entered St Joseph's junior seminary at Mark Cross, Sussex, in September 1927 and progressed two years later into the senior seminary, St John's College, Wonersh, near Guildford, where he remained for six years. Then, being accepted by the new archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, he was ordained priest in Edinburgh Cathedral on 15 June 1935.<br>
<br>Gray's first appointment was to assist his uncle, parish priest at St Andrews; while there he studied for a degree at the university. Four years later he graduated with honours in English language and literature. His archbishop wished him to acquire an educational qualification but the outbreak of war in September 1939 thwarted the plan. Instead he continued to work in the parish. In August 1941 he was appointed parish priest of Hawick. Pastoral work was complicated by wartime conditions and he also served German and Italian prisoner-of-war camps. He was appointed dean of the borders, served on Roxburgh education committee, and in 1944 published a booklet for the parish centenary.<br>
<br>In 1947 the Scottish bishops appointed Gray rector of the national junior seminary, St Mary's College, Blairs, near Aberdeen. He was also headmaster and procurator, with an estate and two farms under his care, but his main concern was to feed 200 growing boys despite post-war shortages. Although he considered the college regime less spartan than at Mark Cross, he wondered later if he should have been more liberal. In June 1951, aged just forty, he was appointed archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, one of the youngest archbishops in the whole Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Gray received episcopal ordination in Edinburgh Cathedral on 21 September 1951. The tasks confronting him were enormous, for it was a far-flung diocese and, owing to the late archbishop's illness, there was an enormous backlog of confirmations due. At that time, too, people were being moved out from overcrowded city centres to housing estates on the outskirts, necessitating the establishment of new parishes. He worked flat out, until after eighteen months he suffered a complete breakdown, from which his recovery was slow. Two notable achievements marked his first years as archbishop. In 1953 he established a diocesan senior seminary at Drygrange, near Melrose, and he was one of the first bishops in the world to send priests to Africa in response to the papal appeal in <span class="italic">Fidei donum</span> (1957). This led eventually, in 1964, to his assuming responsibility for staffing and financing the church in Bauchi province, Nigeria. His responsibilities in Scotland also grew: in 1963&#150;4 he was apostolic administrator of Aberdeen diocese and from 1963 he was president of the Scottish bishops' conference.<br>
<br>The Second Vatican Council took place in 1962&#150;5. Gray sent in suggestions for the agenda but was unwilling to make any spoken intervention, as it had to be in Latin. Indeed he was very critical of this regulation, for it disadvantaged the &#145;pastoral&#146; bishops and often prevented them from speaking. Extra difficulty was caused when at weekends he had to fly home to Edinburgh and Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Right from its first meeting in October 1963, Gray was much involved in the International Commission for English in the Liturgy (ICEL). In 1965&#150;71 he was its chairman and thereafter remained on its episcopal board. Not surprisingly, given his initiative in Bauchi, in late 1968 he became a member of the Sacred Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. Already his long membership had begun on the Consilium (later upgraded to be the Sacred Congregation) for Divine Worship.<br>
<br>Gray was severely critical of the Vatican's poor record in dealing with the media. He had assisted in setting up the National Catholic Radio and Television Centre at Hatch End, London, in 1955 and for many years sat on the Central Religious Advisory Council for the BBC. In 1970 he agreed to chair the Pontifical Commission for Social Communication, but only after it was agreed to install simultaneous translation for meetings; then as chairman he overruled the formal regulations and allowed free debate. The first agenda was to finalize the pastoral instruction on communications, which appeared in 1971 simultaneously with readable versions in the main languages.<br>
<br>In April 1969 Gray was created a cardinal&#151;technically cardinal-priest of the title Santa Chiara a Vigna Clara&#151;which was perhaps unexpected but not surprising, given his work on the ICEL and Vatican bodies. He was also a personal friend of the pope, Paul VI. His elevation was welcomed almost unanimously by the media and the churches in Scotland. At Rome over 400 Scots attended the ceremonies, at one of which Pope Paul presented him with a relic of St Andrew. His duties as cardinal were to include taking part in the conclaves which elected John Paul I and John Paul II and accompanying the latter to Poland, France, and Ireland. Honours were bestowed on him in Scotland too: honorary degrees from St Andrews in 1967 and Heriot-Watt in 1981, and an honorary fellowship of the Educational Institute of Scotland in 1970.<br>
<br>The highlight of Gray's career was undoubtedly the visit of Pope John Paul II to Scotland in June 1982. The visit was an unqualified success and not only because of the enthusiastic youth rally and the papal mass before 300,000 people. It was also an outstanding ecumenical success, with leaders of other churches taking part and crowds lining the streets wherever the pope went. The culmination was the pope and the moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland shaking hands beneath the statue of John Knox: formal perhaps, but of enormous significance.<br>
<br>In the early 1980s, as his health deteriorated, Gray offered to resign and finally retired in May 1985. He himself admitted that he found it hard to say &#145;No&#146; or to delegate, which increased his workload. From his early youth he had worked with his hands; in fact he was skilled at woodwork and a very competent gardener. In his later years he rather unwisely continued to do heavy work in his garden despite trouble with his back, until increasingly he was confined to a wheelchair through arthritis and other ailments. Taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with a failing heart, he died there on 19 July 1993 and was buried on 23 July in the crypt of his cathedral.<br>
<br>Gray was essentially a simple man with simple tastes, kindly and hospitable, shrewd but cautious. Physically he was big, with craggy features and a natural dignified bearing. His voice, strong, deep, and warm, was an asset and his Scots accent never varied, perhaps because he was a very poor linguist. He was almost the epitome of a Scotsman and proud of his traditionally Catholic Banffshire ancestry. The combination of these qualities made him a sort of father figure, known for his gardening, his dog, and his pipe, rather than as a prince of the church.<br>
<br>Great changes marked Gray's long episcopate. He was naturally cautious and, being a traditional Catholic, conservative as regards doctrinal and moral questions. Friendly by nature, he enjoyed increasingly warm relations with other churches, accepted invitations to speak or preach and sat on inter-church bodies. In 1966 he gave the imprimatur for the Catholic edition of the Revised Standard Version <span class="roman">Bible</span>, but theologically he went no further than stressing what Catholics and others held in common. His attitude to Rome was similar, combining veneration for the papacy as an institution with disapproval of some features of papal government. He twice protested strongly and successfully against what he considered interference in a diocesan matter by a Roman curial body. He appreciated the new vision of the Second Vatican Council and implemented the required changes, but with caution and in some matters with a certain scepticism.<br>
<br>Gray established thirty new parishes and built thirty-seven churches, while the number of priests increased, reached a peak in 1965, and then declined, making it necessary to unite parishes. He was greatly distressed by men leaving the priesthood and, after his retirement, by the closure of Blairs College and his diocesan seminary. But along with this decline went a rise in prestige. The papal visit in 1982&#151;or perhaps, rather, the reaction of Catholics and others to it&#151;showed that the Roman Catholic church was no longer on the sidelines but in the mainstream of Scottish life. Gray, the first resident Scottish cardinal since the Reformation, played an important part in this change.<br>
