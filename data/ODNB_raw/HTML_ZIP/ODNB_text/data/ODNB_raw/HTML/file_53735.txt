<span class="headword">Wittie <span class="st"> [Witty]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was baptized at the church of St Mary, Beverley, Yorkshire, on 14 November 1613. He was the eldest and only surviving son of George Wittie (<i>d</i>. 1649), a baker of Beverley, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of William Howard of Thearne, 3 miles away. Both parents were of families long settled in the East Riding. Wittie was a pupil at Beverley grammar school before entering King's College, Cambridge, as pensioner at Easter 1629. He graduated BA in 1633, MA in 1636, while teaching in Hull, and MD in 1647, when in medical practice there. His marriage to Mary Hall (<i>d</i>. 1691), second daughter of Henry Hall esquire of East Lilling, North Riding of Yorkshire, which had taken place by 1649, appears to have been childless. Wittie was incorporated at Oxford on 13 July 1680, and in September the Royal College of Physicians of London elected him an honorary fellow.<br>
<br>Wittie's interest lies in the resourcefulness with which he used his opportunities, at a time of serious disruption to everyday life, particularly in Yorkshire. He established Scarborough's reputation as a spa, and his many patients testified to the success of his treatment. His achievements were the more remarkable in that his father, an alderman, and mayor of Beverley in 1638, only &#145;made his mark&#146;.<br>
<br>A year after graduating Robert Wittie was appointed usher at the grammar school of Kingston upon Hull with responsibility for teaching the lower forms. An outbreak of plague closed the school in 1637, most inhabitants having fled, and it did not reopen for over a year, though Wittie's services were evidently retained. The school library possessed several medical texts, to which the master, Anthony Stephenson (described by Calamy as &#145;well-skilled in physic&#146;) perhaps introduced him. Wittie also met James Primrose, a French born physician practising in Hull near the school. Later colleagues and close friends, their acquaintance began with Wittie translating Primrose's <span class="italic">De vulgi in medicina erroribus</span> (1638) as <span class="italic">Popular Errours &hellip; in Physick</span>, a work which warned against credulity in medical matters. A short section, on the medicinal use of antimony, then enjoying something of a vogue, was published in 1640 as <span class="italic">The Antimoniall Cup Twice Cast</span>. As the preface to the translation explains, printing of the complete text was delayed &#145;by the distraction of the times&#146;. Wittie's concern to limit the practice of unlicensed quacks continued into later life, as shown by evidence in Sloane MS 1393, fols. 12&#150;17.<br>
<br>Granted a licence to practise medicine in 1641 Wittie resigned his post at the grammar school the following year. In that April dissatisfaction in the north over the king's demands for payment of ship money led to an overt act of defiance by his subjects. When Charles appeared on the 23rd at Hull's Beverley gate demanding access to the large ammunition store then kept in the town, the governor refused to admit the king and his troops, so making one of the opening moves in the civil war. Hull was besieged by royalist forces soon after Sir John Hotham's rebuff, and again in September 1643, when Lord Fairfax was governor. The town was not easy to blockade and, in spite of heavy bombardment, neither siege lasted long. Nevertheless, Wittie's first year or two of practice was conducted under difficult conditions. Following the end of the siege of Scarborough, in the summer of 1645, Wittie treated the survivors of the royalist garrison and found them to be suffering from severe privation and disease, mainly scurvy, not then necessarily meaning vitamin C deficiency, but covering many skin complaints (that is, &#145;scurfy&#146;) variously caused. Three years later Wittie was again called to Scarborough Castle to treat Colonel Matthew Boynton's garrison. On the way home from this visit (27 July 1648) he wrote from Beverley to the mayor and corporation of Hull warning that the governor, after negotiating with Prince Rupert, had declared for the king. The letter suggests that Wittie's sympathies lay with the parliamentarians.<br>
<br>After long delay <span class="italic">Popular Errours &hellip; in Physick</span> came out in 1651 with a dedication to Frances Strickland, wife of an extreme puritan MP. Two poems written by Wittie's friend, the more moderate Andrew Marvell, probably while tutor to Lord Fairfax's daughter Mary, at Nun Appleton, praised the translator for his fidelity to Primrose's original, instead of producing effectively a new book. Primrose's doubts about the wisdom of clergymen and women practising medicine were neatly solved by a text that aimed to instruct them in plain English. The book included one or two additions by Primrose, and his verdict on <span class="italic">The Antimoniall Cup</span>.<br>
<br>Wittie's preface to <span class="italic">Popular Errours</span> was written &#145;from my house in Hull&#146;; by the time it reached print he and his wife were in York, where he practised for thirty years. His mother joined them following the death of her husband and the settlement of his estate (his will was proved in April 1649). The son prospered: he bought an estate of about 260 acres in Holderness, and acquired notable patrons. The earl of Suffolk, Lord Ros (son and heir to the earl of Rutland), and James, Lord Annesley (heir to the earl of Anglesey), all figure in the dedications of his books; others were the subject of case histories. Wittie's mother was buried in the choir of the church of St Martin's-le-Grand in Coney Street, York, in December 1675.<br>
<br>The publication of <span class="italic">Scarbrough Spaw</span>, for which Wittie is principally remembered, coincided with the Restoration of 1660. Mindful of his earlier allegiance he did not ask for royal patronage, but among the miscellanea&#151;anagrams and chronograms&#151;that preface the work, twenty-six lines of self-deprecatory verse commend his &#145;Water Work&#146; to Charles II. Many of its readers enjoyed it, the owner of one copy writing on the flyleaf: &#145;This account of the Scarbro' Spaw is the best that ever I read.&#146; The beneficial effects of Scarborough's mineral springs had been discovered barely ten years before Wittie settled in Hull and, after taking the waters himself, about 1637&#150;8, he prescribed them for conditions ranging from convulsions to gout. Wittie claimed to have identified small amounts of vitriol, nitre, alum, salt, and iron in Scarborough's mineral water in experiments carried out in his laboratory by himself and a learned friend. However, Wittie's work was criticized by two men: William Simpson of York and George Tunstall of Newcastle, who styled themselves &#145;Chymists&#146; and disputed his findings and his &#145;Galenical&#146; therapeutics. An acrimonious dispute developed: from published treatises that broke no bones, it descended to the coffee houses of York. Simpson's language may have been intemperate, but Wittie was guilty of using phrases like &#145;Sir Simpson&#146;, and &#145;base Bachelor of Arts&#146;. The &#145;Chymist&#146;, he said, who used preparations of mercury, iron, copper, antimony, and arsenic, was &#145;a viperous brat eating through the bowells of its dam&#146;. Much energy, paper, and ink was expended by both parties, and Wittie complained that it wasted time he needed to turn <span class="italic">Scarborough Spaw</span> into Latin (<span class="italic">Fons Scarburgensis</span> was published in 1678). Meantime Simpson wrote his own book on the subject, lifting material from his opponent's. The controversy seems to have done Wittie's York practice no harm, but the scene at Scarborough was changing. In addition to promoting the waters themselves, Wittie had pointed out the value of relaxation in a bracing climate with congenial company, and these attractions gradually became more important.<br>
<br>About 1678 Wittie took up residence in Basinghall Street, London, where a niece kept house for him. <span class="italic">Ouranoskopia, or, A Survey of the Heavens</span> (1681) was his response to the wonders opened up by the telescope, which illustrated the infinite power and glory of God in creation, and confirmed the work of Copernicus. Discussing the movement of the planets, Wittie puts forward the possibility that some are inhabited by sentient beings, and that the sun may be the abode of the blessed. He concedes that astronomy may have an application to medical practice. A dramatic poem describing war among the stars, written as a distraction from gout, and published four years earlier, as <span class="italic">Gout Raptures</span>, was printed in Greek, Latin, and English versions, to make it suitable for use in schools.<br>
<br>Wittie died in October 1684 in London, in the parish of St Michael Bassishaw, where he was buried. His will was dated 5 October 1684 and was proved on the 23rd, in London. His widow was executor, and from his estate at Owstwick was to pay a number of bequests to their relatives. Her will, proved in York in 1691, suggests that the commission had not been easy.<br>
