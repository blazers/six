<span class="headword">Arnold,  Thomas Kerchever</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1800, <em>d.</em> 1853), <span class="occ">educational writer and theologian</span>, was born at Stamford, Lincolnshire, where he was baptized on 6 March 1800, the son of Thomas Graham Arnold (1769/70&#150;1855), a doctor of medicine, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was the grandson of Thomas Arnold MD. He was educated at Uppingham School and Dr Heathcote's school, Hackney, before matriculating at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1817. He was seventh junior optime in the mathematical tripos of 1821, and was elected fellow of his college in 1823. He graduated BA in 1821 and MA in 1824. Ordained deacon in 1826 and priest in 1827, he was presented in 1830 to the living of Lyndon, in Rutland, where his parishioners numbered only 100. He at first devoted his ample free time to theology, and showed himself a relentless opponent of the Oxford Movement. He also took pupils at Lyndon and from 1834 until his death he wrote school books, drawing on his experience as a teacher, which gave him a very wide reputation. On 27 March 1828 he married Elizabeth Heathcote, with whom he had at least one daughter. He died at Lyndon rectory of bronchitis after a few days' illness on 9 March 1853. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Latin Syntax and First Reading Book</span> (1836) was one of Arnold's first publications as an educational writer. His <span class="italic">Essentials of Greek Accidence</span> appeared in 1838. This work was followed almost immediately by his <span class="italic">Practical Introduction to Greek Prose Composition</span>, which had an unprecedented success, and was &#145;the keystone of his literary fortunes&#146;. The book reached a fourth edition in 1841, and a seventh in 1849, when its sale had exceeded 20,000 copies. It was at once adopted as a textbook in the leading English public schools. Its chief merit consisted in its author's judicious use of the system and researches of recent German scholars. In 1839 Arnold issued a <span class="italic">Latin Prose Composition</span> on a similar plan, and in the succeeding years he prepared a whole library of classical school books, which included translations and adaptations of many German and American works. His primer, <span class="italic">Henry's First Latin Book</span> (1839; 26th edn, 1883) was widely used by beginners in the language. In association with the Revd J. E. Riddle he published in 1847 an <span class="italic">English&#150;Latin Lexicon</span>, based on a German work by Dr C. E. Georges, which cost him, he wrote in the preface, &#145;many years of labour&#146;. His first known published work was an edition of <span class="italic">Eclogae Ovidianae</span> (1834), with notes abridged from the German edition. Between 1848 and 1853 he edited, in twenty-five volumes, portions of all the chief Latin and Greek authors, and published handbooks of classical antiquities, an <span class="italic">Anticleptic gradus</span>, and similar works.<br>
<br>Arnold oversaw the publication of English, French, German, Italian, and Hebrew grammars, and helped to produce a <span class="italic">Handbook of Hebrew Antiquities</span> and a <span class="italic">Boy's Arithmetic</span>. Almost all his educational writings drew upon German scholarship. In his classical work he depended largely on Madvig, Kr&uuml;ger, Zumpt, and other, lesser-known, scholars; his treatment of modern languages was also based on German models, and he was generally ready to acknowledge his obligations to foreign writers.<br>
<br>As a theological writer Arnold was almost equally voluminous. His earliest published work was a sermon on the faith of Abel, which appeared in the third volume of a collection of <span class="italic">Family Sermons</span> in 1833, and four years later he projected and edited a periodical under the title of the <span class="italic">Churchman's Quarterly Magazine</span>, which soon perished. In January 1844 he published the first number of the <span class="italic">Churchman's Monthly Companion</span>, which succumbed to popular indifference eight months later, and in 1851 he started another monthly magazine, entitled the <span class="italic">Theological Critic</span>, which lived on until his death in 1853. Arnold's contributions to theological literature also included five pamphlets on ecclesiastical questions raised by the Oxford Movement; an abridgement of an American version of Hengstenberg's <span class="italic">Christology</span>; two volumes of sermons, one published in 1845, and the other posthumously in 1858; and <span class="italic">Short Helps to Daily Devotion</span> (1847). He likewise issued controversial treatises criticizing well-known theological works like Taylor's <span class="italic">Interpretations of the Fathers</span>, Elliott's <span class="italic">Horae apocalypticae</span>, and Dean Close's sermons, in all of which, &#145;his critical eye discerned unsoundness &hellip; that, if not exposed, was likely to do extensive mischief&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 16 March 1853).<br>
<br>Arnold's literary work was of very uneven quality, and only a very small part of the classical portion of it stood the test of time. An article in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> for February 1853, later published in pamphlet form and attributed to Dr J. W. Donaldson, sought in very forcible language to discredit all of Arnold's classical school books. But the unmeasured vituperation of the criticism, which attracted considerable attention at the time, was only very partially justified. In a temperate reply, written a few weeks before his death, Arnold successfully rebutted some of the more sinister imputations on his character made in the article; and he remarked, in reference to the multiplicity of his works, that &#145;regular industry &hellip; with a careful division of times and employments, carried on with hardly any exception for six days in every week, will accomplish a great deal in fifteen years&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Few Words</span>, 15). The popularity of a few of the books that Donaldson specially denounced survived his fierce attack, and they continued to be valued by eminent teachers. Later editions of Arnold's Latin and Greek <span class="italic">Prose Compositions</span>, revised by G. G. Bradley and Evelyn Abbott, appeared in 1881.<br>
