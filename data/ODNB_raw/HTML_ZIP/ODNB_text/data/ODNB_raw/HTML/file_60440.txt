<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Warnock, Sir  Geoffrey James</span>  (1923&#150;1995), <span class="occ">philosopher and college head</span>, was born on 16 August 1923 at Nerike House, Chapel Allerton, Leeds, the only son of James Warnock (1880&#150;1953), a general practitioner originally from northern Ireland, and his wife, Kathleen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hall (1890&#150;1979). He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, being a scholar on both foundations. Between school and university he served in the Irish Guards (1942&#150;5), took part in the advance into Germany, and attained the rank of captain. In 1948 he gained a first in philosophy, politics, and economics. He was elected to a fellowship by examination in philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1949, and was subsequently fellow and tutor, first at Brasenose (1950&#150;53) and then at Magdalen (1953&#150;71). During his tutorial years he made several visits to the United States and taught and lectured at a number of American universities. In 1971 he became principal of Hertford College, Oxford, a post he retained until he retired in 1988; and from 1981 to 1985 he served as vice-chancellor of the university. On 2 July 1949 he married (Helen) Mary Wilson (<i>b</i>. 1924), daughter of Archibald Edward Wilson and his wife, Ethel Mary, eldest daughter of Sir Felix Otto Schuster, first baronet. Mary Warnock was herself a professional philosopher who became mistress of Girton College, Cambridge (1985&#150;91), headed a number of public inquiries, and was made a life peer as Baroness Warnock of Weeke in 1985. They had three daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Both to academic philosophy and to academic administration Warnock brought a rare and valuable combination of qualities. He wrote, of another philosopher, George Berkeley, the following words: &#145;He was the most acute of critics, a writer of perfect grace and lucidity, and by temperament an enemy to all dullness, pedantry, and needless sophistication&#146;  (G. J. Warnock, <span class="italic">Berkeley</span>, 1953, 12). The words can be applied, with even greater justice, to their author. While Berkeley was led, in the end, to embrace a fantastical metaphysics, Warnock never deviated from the clear and literal truth, and the difficult exercise of cleaving to that path he conducted, in his writings on perception and the philosophy of language, with such an absence of fussiness, with such coolness, urbanity, and elegance, that the result gave (and can still give) not only deep intellectual satisfaction but great aesthetic pleasure.<br>
<br>Warnock's <span class="italic">Berkeley</span> (1953), which exhibited the qualities he praised in its subject, was followed in 1958 by his second book, <span class="italic">English Philosophy since 1900</span>, an excellent survey, which also possessed a particular interest as marking a moment of transition from the mainly critical work of the immediate post-war period to the renewal of more systematic endeavours in the later part of the century. He next turned to a subject which probably engages the interest of the majority of people more than any other philosophical topic&#151;namely the nature of morality; and after subjecting some current views to a devastating critique in <span class="italic">Contemporary Moral Philosophy</span> (1967) he produced his own positive account in <span class="italic">The Object of Morality</span> (1971). The very title was contentious, like the subject itself; yet the author may be held to have come as close in this book to the truth of the matter as any other writer of his age&#151;or perhaps of any age. It was marked throughout with the coolness and balance, sensitivity and humanity, which were typical of the man.<br>
<br>It was not only in the sphere of morality that Warnock showed his philosophical venturesomeness. Of all the philosophers of his time the one he admired more than any other was J. L. Austin; and Warnock undertook, and published as his last book, a critical study of Austin's work, <span class="italic">J. L. Austin</span> (1989). This was much earlier preceded by his brilliant reconstruction, from very fragmentary notes, of Austin's famous lectures on perception, delivered under the characteristic title <span class="italic">Sense and Sensibilia</span> (1962). In this he captured not only the substance of the lectures, but the personal style, the very note, of the man&#151;the mordant wit, the total originality, the devastating force, the extreme sensitivity to the nuances of language. The reconstruction was a wonderful revelation of these qualities. It was also a tribute. So too, in its way, was his final study of Austin's entire <i>&#339;uvre</i>. But this was not merely a tribute; for here Warnock gave his own critical, as well as expository, powers their full scope. His concern for accuracy, precision, and literal truth were brought to bear, and most tellingly brought to bear, on his subject. The necessary corrections and qualifications were duly and decisively made; but this without any abatement of recognition of the power and enduring value and influence of Austin's work. The book, in fact, was a demonstration that a sincere and discriminating admirer of a great and original philosopher need not be, and should not be, a mere disciple.<br>
<br>In the other strand of his career, as college and university administrator, Warnock showed equal distinction. As principal of Hertford College from 1971 to 1988 he presided over the transformation of what was once one of the smallest, poorest, and least regarded of Oxford's men's colleges into a mixed middle-sized college with sound finances and impressive academic results. Although some of the measures that benefited Hertford were in place before his arrival, notably the new and progressive admissions policy, their fruition owed much to his calm, clear-sighted, and good-humoured government. The qualities and leadership he there displayed led to his choice as vice-chancellor of the university in 1981, an office he held until 1985 during a difficult period of government retrenchment on higher education funding. He conducted the business of Oxford's hebdomadal council with such fairness and reasonableness, and such lucidity of presentation, that debate was minimized. He made no secret of the fact that he deplored the erosion of university funding&#151;a theme he returned to in his last speech, made on the occasion of the opening of Hertford's new student residence, named Warnock House, on the Isis near Folly Bridge. Twelve days later he died of a disabling illness which he had borne with stoicism: it was typical of his courage and courtesy that he held off its advances long enough to come to the opening and to delight his friends and colleagues with a witty and eloquent valedictory speech. He was knighted in 1986 and had been previously elected to honorary fellowships at New College and Magdalen. His was an exemplary Oxford career.<br>
<br>The bare record of Warnock's professional and public achievement might give an impression of austerity. But he was far from austere. He had a great capacity for enjoyment, and a lively sense of the ridiculous, being vastly and delightfully amused by the absurdities which so often cropped up in human speech and behaviour. He was a games player, a keen cricketer and golfer; and all his friends and colleagues found him a charming companion, invariably courteous and considerate, indeed chivalrous, in personal relations. In the old phrase, he was &#145;a man of feeling&#146;. He responded with equal warmth to the charm and beauty of Italy, its opera and architecture, and to the prose and poetry of England. He himself wrote and published distinguished verses  (<span class="italic">Poems</span>, 1955), in which his characteristic combination of sensibility, realism, and restraint found happy expression in polished and elegant form. He died of fibrosing alveolitis on 8 October 1995 at his home, Brick House, Axford, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, and was buried on 13 October at Axford church. He was survived by his wife and five children.<br>
