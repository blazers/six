<span class="headword">Prince <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>James]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1788), <span class="occ">freed slave</span>, was born at Brackish Pond, Devonshire parish, Bermuda. She was the daughter of slaves: her mother was a house-servant, her father, named Prince, was a sawyer. Mary (or Molly) Prince was the first black British woman to &#145;walk away&#146; from slavery, claim her freedom, and chronicle her experiences. Her narrative, entitled <span class="italic">The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave</span>, was published in London in 1831. The book catalogues Mary Prince's struggle to survive in Bermuda, Turks Island, Antigua, and finally in England.<br>
<br>Sold in front of her mother and siblings at the age of ten, Mary Prince was passed around a succession of sadistic masters, beginning with Captain and Mrs I&#151;. On Turks Island she worked up to her waist in salt ponds all day, plagued by boils; she endured sexual abuse at the whim of another master, Mr D&#151;. She returned to Bermuda in 1810 and then was sold at her own request to Mr and Mrs John Wood. They ill-treated her in Bermuda, Antigua, and London, but perversely refused to sell her or to allow her to purchase her own freedom. She was converted to Moravianism in Antigua, where she also married a free black carpenter, Daniel James, about December 1826. She remained in slavery in Antigua until the Woods took her to England in 1828.<br>
<br>Slavery was outlawed in Britain (although not her colonies) by this time, and in London, Mary Prince decided not to endure the cruelty of the Woods any longer, and walked quietly to freedom. She made her way to the headquarters of the Anti-Slavery Society, and ended up working for Mary and Thomas Pringle. Thomas Pringle was secretary of the society, and it was he who submitted her unsuccessful petition to parliament to be emancipated in 1829. (Formal manumission was essential if a former slave wished to return to the West Indies without reverting to slavery.) Effectively trapped in England, Mary Prince narrated her experiences as a slave to Susannah Moodie, a sister of the historian Agnes Strickland; this was published as <span class="italic">The History of Mary Prince</span> (1831). Edited by Thomas Pringle, it ran to three editions in the first year, later editions additionally containing testimonials on her behalf and an appendix describing &#145;the marks of former ill-usage on Mary Prince's body&#146;.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">History</span> was highly controversial: an attack by the pro-slavery editor, James MacQueen, of <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (November 1831) led Pringle to sue the publisher, Thomas Cadell, and the Woods to counter-sue Pringle. On both occasions Mary Prince appeared in court to give evidence. The <span class="italic">History of Mary Prince</span> became a valuable document in the struggle for the abolition of slavery; the fate of its author remains unknown. After 1833 Mary Prince disappears from the record, and it is not known whether she died or succeeded in rejoining her husband in Antigua.<br>
