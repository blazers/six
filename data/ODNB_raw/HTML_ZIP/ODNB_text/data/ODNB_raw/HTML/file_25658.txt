<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skeffington, Sir  Lumley St George</span>, second baronet  (1771&#150;1850), <span class="occ">fop and playwright</span>, younger but only surviving son of Sir William Charles Farrell Skeffington, first baronet (1742&#150;1815), and Catherine Josepha (<i>c</i>.1743&#150;1811), daughter of Michael Hubbert of Tenerife, merchant, was born in the parish of St Pancras, London, on 23 March 1771. He was educated at Newcome's school at Hackney, and, by taking part in the plays for which the institution was famous, acquired a taste for drama. On leaving school he was admitted into the select circle at Carlton House and soon set the fashions for the youth of the day: he was consulted on the subject of attire by the prince regent, and invented a new colour, known as &#145;Skeffington brown&#146;. His features were large, and he had a sharp, sallow face, with dark curly hair and whiskers. For many years his dress was &#145;a dark blue coat with gilt buttons, a yellow waistcoat, white cord inexpressibles, with large bunches of white ribbons at the knees, and short top boots&#146;. Among his friends were the actors John Kemble, Mrs Siddons, and &#145;Romeo&#146; Coates; he never missed a first night or a d&eacute;but, and often visited four theatres on the same evening. Between 1802 and 1813 Skeffington himself wrote a number of dramatic works, trying his hand at comedy, melodrama, and opera, and produced some of them in the theatre; none met with lasting success. Widely ridiculed, he was a natural target for the satirical cartoonist Gillray, who depicted him a number of times.<br>
<br>Skeffington succeeded to the baronetcy and family property on his father's death in January 1815; but he had permitted his father to cut off the entail of their large estates, and his reckless extravagance had wasted the rest of his resources. His debts caused him to spend several years within the rules of the king's bench prison, living near the Surrey Theatre in Southwark. Some time before his death he recovered a hereditary estate producing about &pound;800 per annum; but he failed in his action in 1838 to obtain possession of the Hubbert property at Rotherhithe. He still continued to live in the southern suburbs, and it was at that time that Henry Vizetelly made his acquaintance. He was &#145;a quiet, courteous, aristocratic-looking old gentleman, an ancient fop &hellip; wore false hair, and rouged his cheeks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glances Back</span>, 111). He entertained, and had a great store of anecdotes. It was his boast that the secret of life lay in &#145;never stirring out of doors during the cold damp winter months, and in living in a suite of rooms&#146;, so that he could constantly shift from one to another  (Vizetelly, <span class="italic">Glances Back</span>, 112). He died, unmarried, on 10 November 1850 in lodgings near the Indigent Blind School, St George's Fields, Southwark, close to the king's bench prison, of which he had again lately been an inmate; he was buried at Norwood cemetery on 15 November. The title became extinct.<br>
