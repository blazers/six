<span class="headword">Cade,  (Dorothy Mary) Rowena</span>  (1893&#150;1983), <span class="occ">founder of the Minack Theatre, Cornwall</span>, was born at The Homestead, Spondon, Derbyshire, on 2 August 1893, the elder daughter and second child in the family of two daughters and two sons of Charles James Cade (1850&#150;1917) and his wife, Mary Rowena Elizabeth Casterton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smelt (1859&#150;1946). Her father owned the town's cotton mill and the family had lived in the area for over three hundred years. Her great-great-grandfather was Joseph Wright, a well-known painter of the industrial revolution. Her consuming interest in theatre dated back to when, at the age of eight, she played Alice in a family production of <span class="italic">Through the Looking Glass</span>, though in other ways she was a tomboy, preferring tree-climbing and games. When she was nine the family moved to Cheltenham, as her uncle was headmaster of Cheltenham College junior school, and later she became what she described as an &#145;unwilling pupil&#146; at Cheltenham Ladies' College. At the beginning of the First World War she was sent to Sir John Gilbey's estate at Elsenham to work in the remount stables, where she happily traded living in a fine great house for looking after herself in an old caravan. Her job was to select and break in horses to be sent out to France and Belgium for the cavalry.<br>
<br>Cade's father died during the war, the family was scattered, and the Cheltenham house sold. After moving around a good deal she and her mother finally went to Cornwall, and Rowena decided that she wanted to settle there. Shortly afterwards she bought the whole of the Minack headland, not far from Land's End, for just &pound;100 and had Minack House built there, using local granite from a nearby quarry. The Cades had been used to making their own entertainment and throughout the 1920s they had put on a number of plays in the garden with family and friends, Rowena making and designing costumes. It was a more ambitious project, a production of <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> in 1928, and its repeat a year later, that made her determined to provide a proper theatrical space. Below her garden was a natural amphitheatre and it was there that Cade set about creating the magnificent open-air Minack Theatre, on the cliffs above Porthcurno. She was assisted by her gardener, Billy Rawlings, and a local craftsman, Charles Thomas Angove. From the first the work was hard: terraces had to be cut for seating and it took months even to make a surface for a rough stage. The Minack Theatre became her all-consuming passion and she was to spend every working moment in it until almost the very end of her life. Charles Angove recalled her single-handedly carrying twelve 15 foot wooden beams that were washed up on the beach from the shore to the theatre, and local people remembered seeing her bringing sacks of sand on her back up the steep cliff path from the beach. No one who ever saw her at work could forget the spare, almost gaunt, figure with short silver hair and weather-beaten face, dressed in her uniform of jersey, knee breeches, thick socks, and boots, and almost always carrying a bucket of cement or concrete. The first production at the theatre was <span class="italic">The Tempest</span> in 1932, lit by batteries and car headlights. Regular productions followed right up until the Second World War, while the work of providing seating, a better playing area, and, eventually, a dressing-room continued, all the work being undertaken by Rowena Cade and her two assistants. The war put paid to any performances until 1944 when the film <span class="italic">Love Story</span> was filmed there. As soon as it was possible she worked unceasingly to make improvements, more seating, a car park, steps up from the beach, safety measures&#151;as late as the 1960s getting from one side of the stage to the other over a deep inlet was hazardous to say the least. In 1966 Billy Rawlings died and Rowena inscribed his name on a seat, the only one which has this distinction, the others bearing the names of past productions.<br>
<br>From the two or three plays in a summer during the 1950s the season grew to sixteen weeks every year, with companies competing to play at the theatre, which now also boasts a proper lighting and sound box, better dressing rooms, a caf&eacute;, lavatories, and an exhibition centre. Since the Second World War almost every kind of play has been produced, from Shakespeare and the classics to modern comedy and musicals. Large-cast plays with a strong storyline and a good deal of action (such as Shakespeare) generally work best there, as more intimate and static drama is liable to disappear when performed against such a stunning natural background. From the outset Rowena Cade financed the theatre from her own pocket, and after several failed attempts to find a body willing to take over the upkeep of the theatre from her, she finally gave it to a specially formed charitable trust, the Minack Theatre Trust. She was still working in the theatre in 1976 when she was well over eighty, and before she died she bought a nearby bungalow and more land to provide theatre offices and a larger car park. She died peacefully at Minack House on 26 March 1983, and was buried on 30 March. Few twentieth-century women can have left so spectacular a physical memorial behind them.<br>
