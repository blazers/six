<span class="headword">Coles,  Gilbert</span>  (1617?&#150;1676), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Burfield in Berkshire, the son of Edmund Coles, then or later of Winchester, a clergyman. In 1626 Coles was admitted to Winchester College and on 6 November 1635, aged eighteen, he matriculated from New College, Oxford, where he obtained a full fellowship in 1637; he graduated BA on 13 June 1639 and proceeded MA on 12 April 1643. On 8 May 1648 he was one of those members of New College who formally refused to recognize the authority of the parliamentary visitors at Oxford. Coles was expelled by them from the university a week later, but was admitted a week after that as a fellow of Winchester. By this time he had acquired the rectory of East Meon in Hampshire; later he became rector of two other Hampshire livings, Easton, near Winchester, and Ashe. He was created DD at Oxford on 2 July 1667.<br>
<br>Coles had married his first wife, Ann, by January 1654, when their son Gilbert was baptized at Lockerley, Hampshire, the first of two sons and six daughters baptized there in the period up to September 1660. After her death he married again, by a licence dated 26 June 1669, and when he made his will in July 1672 there were living: his second wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Henderson); four daughters, Anne, Cicely, Martha, and Mary; and three sons, Gilbert, Edward, and Robert, the last an infant when his father died. On Gilbert, then eighteen, Coles, as he ruefully recalled in his will made in 1672, had spent &pound;100 on two apprenticeships and on paying off his debts &#145;unworthily Contracted&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/352, 91<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Coles's <span class="italic">Theophilus and Orthodoxus, or, Several conferences between two friends, the one a true son of the Church of England, the other fallen off to the church of Rome</span> was published in 1674. The author thought that Anglicanism had lacked effective champions ever &#145;since a puritan faction made the schism, disturbing the peace of the church and state; approving themselves better skilled at their weapons than their arguments; instead of writing against their adversaries, writing against their friends&#146;. But &#145;since his majesty's miraculous and happy return, the church hath had time to breathe, and all things move in their own sphere&#146;  (sig. A2). In the following year, 1675, Coles resigned his Winchester fellowship, and on 4 August his son Edward, then of Mottisfont, near Romsey in Hampshire, was admitted as a fellow of the college.<br>
<br>Gilbert Coles died on 19 June 1676, aged fifty-eight, and was buried in the church at Easton. He was wealthy enough to leave &pound;1200 to his children, and property for the use and financial support of his wife, who survived him.<br>
