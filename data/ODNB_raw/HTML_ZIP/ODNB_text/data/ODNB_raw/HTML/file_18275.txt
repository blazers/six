<span class="headword">Mason,  Henry Joseph Monck</span>  (1778&#150;1858), <span class="occ">legal writer and antiquary</span>, was born at Powerscourt, co. Wicklow, on 15 July 1778, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Monck Mason of Kildare Street, Dublin, and his second wife, Jane, the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19405/', "Bartholomew Mosse MD")</script>. His uncle was John Monck and his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18294/', "William Charles Monck Mason")</script>, the antiquarian scholar. After attending schools at Portarlington and Dublin, Mason entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 7 October 1793. He was elected a scholar in 1796, and was awarded the gold medal, along with his BA, in 1798. During his time at college he befriended the poet Thomas Moore; their friendship continued into later life.<br>
<br>In Trinity term 1800 Mason was called to the Irish bar, but he did not practise. Under judges Radcliffe and Keatinge he held the post of examiner to the prerogative court. About 1810 he was asked by the record commissioners for Ireland to prepare a draft catalogue of the manuscripts of Trinity College, Dublin. Although he never finished the project, his work in progress was eventually acquired by the college and deposited in the manuscript room, and he was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy on 22 June 1812. In Easter term 1814 he was appointed assistant librarian of the King's Inns, Dublin, and in 1815 he became chief librarian; he was awarded the honorary degrees of LLB and LLD by the University of Dublin in 1817. During a tour in Cumberland in 1814 Mason came to know Robert Southey, and they corresponded for twenty years. In 1816 he married the Hon. Anne Langrishe; they had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In 1818, with the help of Bishop Daly, Mason founded the Irish Society for &#145;promoting the scriptural education and religious instruction of the Irish-speaking population chiefly through the medium of their own language&#146;, and he also acted as its secretary for many years, writing many papers to further its causes. At his suggestion two scholarships (the Bedell scholarships) and a bursary, to be held at Dublin University, were founded in 1844 to encourage the study of the Irish language, and it was largely due to his influence that a chair of Irish was established at the university. In 1818 he also helped to found an association for the improvement of prisons and of prison discipline in Ireland, and in 1819 he published a pamphlet on the objects of the association. He also visited prisons in the hope of rehabilitating first offenders.<br>
<br>Mason's most enduring work of scholarship was his <span class="italic">Essay on the Antiquity and Constitution of Parliaments in Ireland</span> (1820), which offered a concise account of his history of Irish common and statute law from the period of the Anglo-Norman invasion to the reign of Charles I. Originally intended as an introduction to a projected work on the annals of the early Irish which would describe developments to the year 1782, the sequel was never finished or published. Yet his essay was still being reprinted as late as 1891, when a short biography of its author was appended by the Revd John Canon O'Hanlon. In 1830 Mason also published a <span class="italic">Grammar of the Irish Language</span> (2nd edn, 1839), in which he admitted that he was acquainted with Irish only as a written language. Following a letter to the <span class="italic">Christian Examiner</span> in September 1833 (pages 618&#150;32), ostensibly criticizing Owen Connellan's edition of the Irish prayer book, but accusing both Mason and Connellan of serious errors in their knowledge of Irish grammar, it was also suggested that the Irish Society's pocket edition of Bedell's <span class="italic">Irish Bible</span> was a mass of errors. Connellan published a defence entitled <span class="italic">A Dissertation on Irish Grammar</span> (1834).<br>
<br>However well or badly the work was translated, Mason is also thought to have been the editor of an Irish-language edition of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> which was published in Dublin in 1825. He also wrote many pamphlets in support of the Irish Society and the Association for the Improvement of Prisons, and a series of papers for the <span class="italic">Christian Examiner</span>. In 1836 he published a letter addressed to Thomas Moore, entitled <span class="italic">Primitive Christianity in Ireland</span>, in refutation of some statements made by Moore in the first volume of his <span class="italic">History of Ireland</span>.<br>
<br>In 1851 Mason resigned as librarian of King's Inns and left his house in Henrietta Street, Dublin, and moved to Dargle Cottage, near Bray, co. Wicklow, where he died on 14 April 1858. He was buried in the old cemetery of Powerscourt Demesne.<br>
