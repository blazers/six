<span class="headword">MacDowell <span class="st"> [Maydland, Madwell, Maydwell]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1500, <em>d.</em> in or after 1566), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and evangelical reformer</span>, was born in Galloway, entered the Dominicans at an unknown date, and was created bachelor of theology by 1524, when the general chapter of his order recorded this fact; it is probable that he studied at Cologne like his fellow friar, John Macalpine, whose degree was recorded at the same time. In 1530 MacDowell was incorporated as a sub-prior of Glasgow in Glasgow University. By 1533&#150;4 he was prior of Wigtown, but had probably left the country by May of that year, bound it seems for France. A certain &#145;Dr Maydland&#146; was alleged to have preached treason against Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn in the London Blackfriars in 1534; this was clearly MacDowell, though he was only a theology bachelor. He went on to the port of Rye, where he stayed with a Scottish priest-physician, Peter Cochrane, and borrowed from the vicar a book by Johann Eck attacking Henry VIII. Under the skilful management of one of Thomas Cromwell's agents, however, he won the patronage of Cromwell and rapidly altered his views. Presented to a chantry of the London Carthusians, on whom he was urged as a preacher once a week by the agent, he was refused, but he did inspect their library.<br>
<br>MacDowell is next heard of as chaplain to the reformed bishop of Salisbury, Nicholas Shaxton, and in 1537 he was commissioned to preach the Lenten sermon. The civic authorities disliked his preaching, and he responded in a sermon at St Edmund's, Salisbury. Cromwell tried to make peace between the parties. On 1 March 1536 MacDowell had been licensed by Cranmer to hold any non-resident benefice, provided he cast aside his Dominican habit. He became a naturalized Englishman in July 1537 (when the vicar of Croydon complained that he damned all singing and organ playing) and in October was made rector of Hawkchurch, Dorset. In 1549 he was in London and preached at St Mary Staining, and also at the burial service for the merchant Christopher Machyn. Arrangements are found in a Sussex will for him to preach in Pett parish church with another reformed preacher, Mr Thomas Rose. MacDowell also preached against King Edward's first prayer book of 1549, which roused the London aldermen against him, so that he soon went briefly into exile. Along with the wives of John Rogers and others, his foreign wife and children were granted English nationality after a petition dated March 1552; in the previous month, as a bachelor of divinity, MacDowell was given licence to preach. However, the accession of Mary Tudor as queen forced him into exile again, and he is mentioned in two lists of exiles from 1557, which record him as Madwell and Maydwell respectively. In 1566 Knox said he was a burgermeister in the &#145;Steads&#146;, presumably Friesland or north Germany. Nothing further is recorded of MacDowell, and it is not known when he died.<br>
