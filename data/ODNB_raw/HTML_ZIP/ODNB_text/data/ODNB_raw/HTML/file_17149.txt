<span class="headword">Lucy,  Richard  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1179), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was born early in the twelfth century, of a family with lands in both Normandy and England. His mother, Aveline, is mentioned in association with the young Richard in several records; his father's name is unknown. The family originated in Normandy, at Luc&eacute;, near Domfront; Richard's brother Walter, later abbot of Battle in Sussex, was at first a monk at Lonlay-l'Abbaye, near Luc&eacute;. Other brothers were Robert and possibly Herbert. Richard married a woman named Roysia, whose origins are unknown, and they had sons named Geoffrey and Godfrey, and daughters Matilda, Aveline, and Alice who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75140/', "Odinel de Umfraville (d. 1182)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54515/', "Umfraville family (per. c.1100&#150;1245)")</script>].<br>
<br>Lucy may have begun his career of royal service under Henry I, from whom he was later said to have received a grant of royal land in Suffolk. By 1136 he was in the service of King Stephen, for whom he daringly and successfully defended the castle of Falaise against Geoffrey of Anjou in October 1138. After this he returned to England, where he remained in almost constant attendance upon the embattled king. Although his only official title in Stephen's reign was apparently that of local justice in Middlesex, London, and Essex from <i>c</i>.1143 onwards, he gradually became one of Stephen's closest associates and right-hand men, steadfast in his service to the king even in the most troubled periods of the anarchy. He served as an intermediary between the king and Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury in 1148, while in the summer of 1153, when support for Stephen was waning among the barons, Richard de Lucy helped lead a raid up the Thames valley into the territory held by Henry of Anjou, who would soon force Stephen into negotiations over the throne. The treaty of Westminster, later the same year, demonstrated the esteem in which both sides held Richard de Lucy, naming him guardian of the Tower of London and Windsor Castle, which he was to hand over to Henry upon Stephen's death; Richard's son was to be a hostage for his father's good faith.<br>
<br>During Stephen's reign Lucy had begun to collect the estates that would eventually form his barony of Ongar. His English inheritance, worth some seven knights' fees, included lands at Diss and Stowe in East Anglia and Newington in Kent; in the latter county he was a tenant of the archbishop of Canterbury. From Stephen he received generous grants from the king's honour of Boulogne, including Chipping Ongar in Essex; here Lucy built a castle and promoted the growth of the town. Concentrated in eastern England, his territorial interests coincided with those of the royal family, and royal grants strengthened the connection.<br>
<br>When Stephen died in 1154 and was succeeded by Henry II, Richard de Lucy moved easily into the new royal administration, and was almost immediately named co-justiciar with Robert, earl of Leicester. Both his familiarity with English government and his unblemished record of loyalty, albeit to Henry's rival, doubtless commended him to the new king, as did his continuing competent service. For the first few years of this reign he served as sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire and was in charge of several royal manors as well. Then he turned more exclusively to the concerns of central government. In 1166 he was one of those sent on the first of the revived judicial eyres. He also continued to carry out occasional military tasks, in 1167 repelling an attempted landing by Matthew, count of Boulogne, claimant to the English honour of Boulogne. As justiciar Lucy often filled a viceregal role while the king was overseas, and he himself was sent on frequent foreign missions.<br>
<br>On the king's orders Lucy played an important role in securing the election of his colleague Thomas Becket as archbishop of Canterbury in 1162; he also helped to draw up the constitutions of Clarendon, which led in 1164 to Becket's quarrel with Henry II. Later that year, when overseas on royal business and possibly returning from a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, he met with the exiled archbishop to urge a reconciliation between him and the king. Instead the two argued bitterly, and Lucy renounced his homage. In 1166 Becket excommunicated him at V&eacute;zelay for his role in drafting the constitutions and for his support of the king. Soon after this Lucy was said to have taken a crusader's vow, but if he did he never fulfilled it. Instead he was absolved by the bishop of St Asaph in 1167, and excommunicated by Becket once again in 1169.<br>
<br>As a servant of Henry II, Lucy continued to increase his lands and wealth. From the king himself he received large &#145;gifts&#146; from the royal revenues, confirmation of Stephen's grants, and (<i>c</i>.1174) a new grant of Ongar hundred. In addition Richard de Lucy became the ally and tenant of various intimates of the new king. Already in 1155 he and his brother Walter enjoyed a &#145;treaty of friendship&#146; with the king's uncle, Reginald, earl of Cornwall, and the royal constable Richard du Hommet, as well as less formal alliances with other <i>familiares</i> of the king. By 1166 he was holding ten knights' fees from Reginald; nine fees from Reginald's tenant Adam Malherbe; and one fee from the honour of Clare in Suffolk. A few years later he was enfeoffed by the king's cousin William, earl of Gloucester, with ten knights' fees at Greenstead in Essex.<br>
<br>Richard de Lucy was left sole justiciar upon the earl of Leicester's death in 1168. It was in the next decade that he reached the pinnacle of his career, being called the king's <i>familiarissimus</i> and &#145;the most powerful man in the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta &hellip; Benedicti</span>, 1.124; <span class="italic">Works of Gervase of Canterbury</span>, 1.241). During the rebellion of 1173&#150;4 he was the leader of the king's forces in England. With Reginald of Cornwall he besieged and captured the town of Leicester, then he and Humphrey (III) de Bohun led a force into northern England and Scotland against the Scottish king, William, who had invaded Northumberland. But, hearing of the landing of the rebellious earl of Leicester in the south, Lucy arranged a truce with William and returned to the midlands, where he laid siege to Huntingdon Castle, which belonged to the Scottish king's brother David. Lucy's prudence, energy, and success during this lengthy crisis permanently increased not only his own reputation but also the power and prestige of the justiciarship itself. Henry was said to call him &#145;de Lucy the loyal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gesta &hellip; Benedicti</span>, 1.124), and it was a surprise to contemporaries when Ongar Castle was among those confiscated by the king in the post-rebellion repossessions of 1176. Lucy was sure enough of his standing with the king to reprimand him for later ignoring the forest privileges he had granted to his servants during the rebellion.<br>
<br>Lucy's eldest son, Geoffrey, predeceased his father, leaving his young son Richard as the justiciar's heir. For his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17148/', "Godfrey de Lucy")</script>, the elder Richard arranged a church career, which culminated in his election to the see of Winchester in 1189. For his daughters Lucy achieved marriages into some of the leading families of Essex: Matilda married Walter fitz Robert de Clare, and Aveline married Gilbert de Montfichet. Alice married Odinel de Umfraville. Richard de Lucy was a benefactor of Holy Trinity Priory in London, where his wife was buried, and a champion of Battle Abbey, where his brother was abbot. His interest in religion increased in the later years of his life. In 1178 he founded a house of Augustinian canons on his land at Lessness, or Westwood, in Kent, not far from Ongar. The foundation was dedicated to the Virgin and St Thomas of Canterbury&#151;the latter an unexpected dedication, in the light of Lucy's difficult relations with the archbishop. He retired from the justiciarship in 1178 or 1179, and entered this house as a canon. He died at Lessness on 14 July 1179, and was buried in the abbey there. He was succeeded by two young grandsons in turn, and eventually by his daughters and granddaughters.<br>
