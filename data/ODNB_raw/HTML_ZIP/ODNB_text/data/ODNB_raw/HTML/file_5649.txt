<span class="headword">Clifford,  Henry</span>, fifth earl of Cumberland  (1592&#150;1643), <span class="occ">local politician and royalist army officer</span>, was born on 28 February 1592 at Londesborough in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the second, surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67095/', "Francis Clifford, fourth earl of Cumberland (1559&#150;1641)")</script>, and Grissell (<i>bap</i>. 1559, <i>d</i>. 1613), elder daughter of Thomas Hughes of Uxbridge, Middlesex, and widow of Edward Neville, Lord Bergavenny. He was educated at first privately and then, until about 1606, at Dean John Higgins's school at Well, near Ripon. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in January 1606, and graduated BA in 1609; and in 1610 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, London. He was created knight of the Bath on 3 June 1610. After his marriage on 25 July 1610 at Kensington to Lady Frances Cecil (1594&#150;1644), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4980/', "Robert Cecil, earl of Salisbury")</script>, he spent a year at M. de Pluvinel's academy in Paris.<br>
<br>Clifford was a tall, dark-haired, scholarly man, a lutenist and poet, skilled in mathematics and architecture, and accomplished in field sports. Although, because of his family's financial problems, he could not, in Clarendon's words, &#145;live with the lustre of his ancestors&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.286), his conviviality towards the Yorkshire gentry gave him the social leadership of the county. He was a patron of musicians and players, planning the songs and masque when Earl Francis entertained James I at Brougham Castle in August 1617, and staging the first full-text presentation of Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span> at Shrovetide 1637 in Skipton Castle where, in 1628, he had converted the outer gatehouse into a showpiece neo-Platonic grotto. He is credited with designing the monument to Countess Grissell, commissioned in 1631 from Nicholas Stone, in All Saints', Londesborough. From 1631 to 1638 he maintained in his household the Dutch painter Hendrick de Keyser the younger. His poems survived in manuscript among his family papers but are lost except for his &#145;Poetical Translations of some Psalms and the Song of Solomon&#146;, now in the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>At court Clifford jousted, carried banners at royal funerals, and escorted foreign dignitaries into the king's presence. With his son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3135/', "Richard Boyle, Lord Dungarvan")</script>, he met the Dutch lords at Thames wharf on 1 January 1641 to negotiate a marriage between William of Nassau and Princess Mary. In 1614 and 1621 he was elected MP for Westmorland and on 17 February 1628 he was summoned to the Lords as Baron Clifford. Having taken over from his ageing father from 1621, he dispensed his family's political patronage in Westmorland and the boroughs of Appleby and Carlisle. By 1619, when he was appointed to the council in the north, he had become the active lord lieutenant first of Cumberland and then Westmorland and Northumberland (offices jointly held with Earl Francis and the Howards, earls of Suffolk), and governor (with Earl Francis) of Carlisle Castle; and from 1641 he was hereditary sheriff of Westmorland. His responsibilities embroiled him in factional rivalry with Lord William Howard of Naworth.<br>
<br>Clifford was prominent in the bishops' wars. Having been appointed governor of Newcastle on 20 February 1639, he completed Sir Jacob Astley's work in preparing its defences and recruited a well-equipped cavalry troop. Given command in Cumberland and Westmorland on 26 March by the lieutenant-general, the earl of Essex, he speedily raised the trained bands to garrison Carlisle, where a Scottish incursion was feared imminent. He saw to their replacement by Sir Francis Willoughby's veteran Irish levies and the safe delivery of ordnance and ammunition sent by sea from Cornwall. Later he raised the trained bands again to secure the frontier defences. However, acting as a conduit between Lord Deputy Wentworth and the court at Berwick and working to prevent the dismembering of Willoughby's force undermined Clifford's position. The lord general, the earl of Arundel, replaced him with his son Sir William Howard, but Clifford refused before Charles I to yield Carlisle Castle to him.<br>
<br>Clifford's disgruntlement did not diminish his commitment during the Second Bishops' War (1640). But it may have given the king's opponents expectations of gaining his support in 1642: on 9 February they nominated the earl of Cumberland (as he had become on his father's death the year before) lord lieutenant of Westmorland. These expectations were unrealistic because Cumberland was a committed royalist who abhorred alike &#145;all manner of poperye and sismatticall opinions&#146;  (Clay, 389). However, he showed some ambiguity after Charles I, responding to the majority gentry views, appointed him commander in Yorkshire in July. During August Clifford acted with urgency, seizing the key castles of Pontefract, Sandal, and Knaresborough and appointing Colonel Sir Philip Musgrave commander in Westmorland. At his own expense he readied Skipton Castle for war and began to recruit in Craven a company of foot and a cavalry troop. Yet he strove to keep Yorkshire at peace, negotiating a truce, the treaty of Rothwell, on 29 September, with his near neighbour Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, and other roundhead leaders in the county, only to see it broken by Sir John Hotham in Hull, and by intransigent parliamentarians in Whitehall.<br>
<br>As Sir Philip Warwick commented, Cumberland's &#145;genius was not military&#146;  (Warwick, 257). He had little military experience and relied on his subordinates such as Sir Thomas Glemham who, lacking adequate forces, suffered reverses which put the whole county at risk. Negotiations with the earl of Newcastle to come to their aid were done with Clifford's cognizance, although he yielded his command in December with reluctance. He retired to Skipton Castle, appointing as governor there in January 1643 Colonel Sir William Mallory, one of his officers in the First Bishops' War. He continued to finance recruitment and also took some part in administration. Following the royalists' defeats in Lancashire in May, he moved to Sir William Robinson's house, Minster Yard, York, where he died of a fever on 11 December, aged fifty-one. His cort&egrave;ge had a military escort to Skipton, with a parade and cannon salute before his interment on 31 December in Holy Trinity Church, Skipton. His countess died at York on 4 February 1644 and was buried in the minster.<br>
<br>By Cumberland's death the Cliffords' earldom of Cumberland became extinct. The barony of Clifford (1299) fell to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5641/', "Lady Anne Clifford")</script> but that of 1628 passed to Clifford's sole surviving child, Elizabeth, Lady Dungarvan, countess of Cork (and later countess of Burlington). His estates were divided between them in accordance with the terms of the king's award of 1617 which settled the family's great inheritance dispute. An original portrait of him by Mytens is in the Devonshire collections. His daughter commemorated him prominently in 1644 by placing his shield on Clifford's Tower, York, beneath the coat of arms of Charles I.<br>
