<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  (James) Steuart</span>  (1889&#150;1966), <span class="occ">singer and musical administrator</span>, was born on 21 July 1889 at Bristol, the youngest child of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36960/', "Revd James Maurice Wilson (1836&#150;1931)")</script>, headmaster of Clifton College and later a canon of Worcester Cathedral, and his second wife, Georgina Mary Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1926), daughter of Admiral John Talbot of Bristol. He had a sister and two brothers, one of whom was the soldier and administrator <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36944/', "Sir Arnold Talbot Wilson (1884&#150;1940)")</script>. He also had four half-brothers and sisters from his father's first marriage, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70137/', "Mona Wilson")</script>. Wilson's education, like his background, was conventional. He went to a preparatory school, Grove House, when he was ten. From there he went to Winchester College, where he was a scholar, and then to King's College, Cambridge, as an honorary exhibitioner reading classics. His gifts as a musician became apparent at an early age. He took piano lessons and sang regularly in Winchester College and Cathedral, but it was not until the Cambridge period that music&#151;and more particularly singing&#151;emerged as his central interest. He was fortunate there in having the encouragement of Professor Edward J. Dent and Ralph Vaughan Williams, and in meeting and working with musicians like Gervase Elwes and Clive Carey, but at no time in his life did he follow any musical course in the orthodox sense. Not surprisingly, he got only a third in the classical tripos at Cambridge (1909).<br>
<br>His first public appearance as a singer was as a soloist and member of the choir in the incidental music written by Vaughan Williams for <span class="italic">The Wasps</span> of Aristophanes, at the New Theatre, Cambridge, in 1909. The composer was so much impressed by his voice that he wrote a special series, <span class="italic">Four Hymns</span>, dedicated to &#145;J. S. W.&#146;, for the Worcester Three Choirs festival in 1914, an event which was cancelled on the outbreak of war. Wilson had in the meantime succeeded Elwes (killed tragically while on tour in America) as the best-known interpreter of the song cycle <span class="italic">On Wenlock Edge</span>, Vaughan Williams's setting of <span class="italic">A Shropshire Lad</span>, by A. E. Housman. He made his first appearance in opera as Tamino in Mozart's <span class="italic">Magic Flute</span>, also at the New Theatre, Cambridge, in 1911; but opera was never to be his special field.<br>
<br>When war broke out Wilson joined the 6th battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps on 22 September 1914. As a captain he was twice wounded, the second time seriously; he lost a kidney and a large part of one lung, and ended his military service in Whitehall. Incredibly, his voice was unaffected by his physical condition (it was a high tenor voice, not in itself of outstanding beauty), and in 1917, while still working at the War Office, he joined Cuthbert Kelly, singing in recitals of madrigals at St Martin-in-the-Fields. This led to the founding of the English Singers as a sextet in 1920. The group did not become self-supporting until 1921, but from that date they went from strength to strength, with successful tours at home and abroad.<br>
<br>From 1921 to 1923 Wilson taught music at Bedales School. With his own school and family education based on traditional classical values, he found himself out of sympathy with the headmaster's advanced views; but this particular job of music director was not over-exacting and left him free to take professional engagements up and down the country. It also established his connection with what was to become the family centre at Petersfield: Canon Wilson lived at Steep, on the outskirts of the town, in his retirement, and Steuart made it his base off and on for the rest of his life. During the Bedales period he worked from Steep, cycling between home, school, and the railway station whence he travelled from one concert fixture to another. He worked hard and under some strain, so developed a duodenal ulcer for which he had more than one operation in later years. In 1925 he went to live in Notting Hill Gate, London, which remained his home until after the Second World War.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1922&#150;3 an offer of material help came from Sir Alexander Butterworth, who had set up a fund in memory of his son George, the composer, killed in the First World War. Wilson was persuaded to accept, and spent two periods in Nice with the Polish operatic tenor Jean de Reszke: six months in 1923&#150;4, and another four in 1924&#150;5. This time of study, with singing lessons from a respected tutor, was the nearest he came to any formal musical training.<br>
<br>English song, English folk-song, German lieder in English (from translations made with his friend Arthur Fox Strangways), and oratorios in English are the lasting memorials to this most English of singers. Wilson's greatest contribution to the performance of music was the painstaking, scholarly attention he gave to the declamation of the role of the evangelist in the passions of <span class="roman">St Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">St John</span> by Bach. He sang them in the language of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, with impeccable timing, subtle vocal colour, and uncanny clarity of diction. In addition to his translations of German lieder he produced new English texts for Haydn's <span class="italic">Creation</span>, Brahms's <span class="italic">German Requiem</span>, and the vocal finale of Mahler's fourth symphony. With Dent he did much to revive the music of Henry Purcell. Always revelling in a good fight, Wilson embarked, in 1933, on a libel case against the BBC. Dubbed the &#145;Case of the Intrusive H&#146;, the action was the result of a letter published in the BBC's weekly paper, <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, in which the writer complained of his pronunciation in a broadcast performance of the <span class="roman">St Matthew passion</span>. Wilson fought and won, and his belligerency was saved from malice by the wit and gaiety of his testimony in court. He used most of the &pound;2000 awarded to him in damages to help his friend Rutland Boughton, whose opera <span class="italic">The Lily Maid</span> he brought to London. His was not a permanent rupture with the BBC: ten years later he joined the BBC staff.<br>
<br>From 1939 to 1942 Wilson had a short spell in America, at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and elsewhere. At the age of fifty-three he embraced a new career, and he brought to the work of an administrator all the vigour he had previously expended as a performer. In 1943 he was appointed overseas music director to the BBC, and then in 1945 he became music director of the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, which became the Arts Council in 1945. Wilson stayed with it until January 1948, then returned to the BBC as music director, in succession to Victor Hely-Hutchinson. He was knighted in the same year. Thereafter he held several other appointments, including that of deputy to David Webster, the general administrator of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, from 1950 to 1955&#151;Wilson had been one of the original trustees of the newly founded Opera House in 1946. Unfortunately an antipathy developed between Wilson and Webster, and Wilson left Covent Garden. His final, and also unhappy, appointment was as principal of the Birmingham School of Music. He travelled much, at home and abroad, adjudicating and examining, and gradually drifted towards retirement at Petersfield, where he died at his home, Fenn's, Reservoir Lane, on 18 December 1966.<br>
<br>Wilson was married three times, first, in 1917, to Ann Mary Grace, younger daughter of Captain Francis Alan Richard Bowles RN, retired, of Sittingbourne, Kent; this marriage was dissolved in 1932: In the following year his former wife married the conductor Adrian Boult. Second, in 1937, Wilson married Mary Daisy Goodchild (who died in 1960 in India, where Wilson was examining for the Trinity College of Music). In 1962 he married Margaret Stewart, widow of Leslie Hunter of Brockham Green, Surrey, a friend of Cambridge days. He had four children with his first wife, one of whom, Jonathan, was killed in the Second World War. It was in memory of Jonathan that he helped to finance the Council for Music in Hospitals: he also served as one of its vice-presidents. In addition, Wilson consistently championed the cause of the amateur music-makers and their sponsors; bodies like the English Folk Dance and Song Society, the International Folk Music Council, and the Rural Music Schools Council owed much to his support.<br>
<br>Steuart Wilson was a difficult man. Colleagues found him stimulating, generous, always exciting, but he was also prickly and impatient of authority. As a public servant he hated hiding behind the anonymity of office. If anything went wrong he wanted to take the full blame himself; it might almost be said that he courted it. His life was a series of confrontations, but in spite of stress, sometimes causing actual illness, he thrived on them. He overflowed with original ideas, many of them impossible to realize. He also listened to other people's ideas, and if convinced by any of them, was the first to demand immediate action. He cared for the success of all who worked alongside, and there are many who remember his thoughtfulness. He could be a loyal friend, but he was also an implacable enemy.<br>
<br>Wilson was excellent company. His friends remember that the singer of Bach passion music could also be a wholeheartedly bawdy entertainer in the home, with, among other delights, his inimitable rendering of the apparently innocent folk-song &#145;The Foggy, Foggy Dew&#146;. He enjoyed entertaining, and was no mean cook, often receiving his guests in the kitchen, clad in his French chef's apron. He was always a good-looking man, and in older age aristocratically impressive. He was not unaware of it and, though far from vain, dressed distinctively. For example, he owned a collection of embroidered waistcoats with elaborate buttons of porcelain and enamel to go with them. In the later 1940s he could be seen on summer days in a pale blue and white striped seersucker suit. In the summer of 1966, six months before his death, he attended the opera at Glyndebourne wearing sponge-bag trousers, a morning coat, a resplendent waistcoat, and a pair of espadrilles.<br>
