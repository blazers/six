<span class="headword">Pease,  Joseph Albert <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>, first Baron Gainford  (1860&#150;1943), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Woodlands, Darlington, on 17 January 1860, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35447/', "Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, bt (1828&#150;1903)")</script>, industrialist and banker, and his wife, Mary Fox (<i>d</i>. 1892). Jack Pease, as he was known, enjoyed an early life of wealth and privilege in one of Britain's most prominent Quaker industrial and political dynasties. Like his older brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58258/', "Alfred Edward Pease")</script>, he was educated at Grove House, Tottenham, a Quaker school. He was afterwards privately tutored by Mandell Creighton before following Alfred to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1878. He took an undistinguished BA in 1882, but shone as secretary of the amateur dramatic club, was master of the university drag hounds, and represented the university at polo, rugby, and putting the weight. He captained the Trinity cricket eleven, was twelfth man for the university, and was then a founder member and captain of the Durham county side. <span class="italic">Wisden</span> records that he continued to play until, at the age of seventy-four, his inability to take quick singles persuaded him it was time to retire.<br>
<br>Cambridge friends such as J. M. (Harry) Paulton and Eddie Tennant (later Lord Glenconner) shared enduring interests in sport and politics. Tennant's sister Margot, whose passion for riding to hounds matched Pease's, was also to become a lifelong friend. Her marriage to H. H. Asquith drew Pease into the upper social circles of the Liberal Party. Comfortable berths in the family coal and banking enterprises had afforded him sufficient leisure to embark on a career in politics. A Durham county councillor from 1887 until 1902, Pease was mayor of Darlington during 1888&#150;9 (Britain's youngest mayor). Elected MP for Tynemouth in 1892, he was parliamentary private secretary (1893&#150;5) to John Morley as chief secretary for Ireland, a post to which he aspired himself in the latter years of Asquith's premiership.<br>
<br>Made a whip in 1897, Pease faithfully understudied Herbert Gladstone. In opposition he made well-publicized noises about not being a pro-Boer without ever aligning himself unequivocally with the Liberal Imperialists. A more serious impediment to his advancement when Campbell-Bannerman came to power was the collapse of the Pease fortunes (1902), a calamity largely attributable to his father's improvident management of the family businesses. Generous friends rescued him from the brink of bankruptcy, but Pease's reduced circumstances were to make personal financial concerns a continuing distraction thereafter.<br>
<br>Pease's formidable wife Ethel 
    (Elsie; <i>d</i>. 1941)
  , whom he had married on 18 October 1886, was particularly irked at the curb on her social ambitions. The daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12628/', "Sir Henry Marshman Havelock-Allan, bt")</script>, and granddaughter of the hero of Lucknow, Sir Henry Havelock, Elsie's hopes for her son and two daughters were as undisguised as her ambition for her husband. His elevation as Asquith's patronage secretary to the Treasury in 1908 brought limited satisfaction. Successful reorganization of the Liberal Party machinery and unobtrusively effective parliamentary management during the budget turbulence of 1909 impressed the prime minister. Asquith brought him into the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster notwithstanding the loss of his Saffron Walden seat in January 1910. A move to Rotherham gave him a constituency that was safe as long as the local miners did not unite behind a Labour candidate.<br>
<br>Pease's promotion to the cabinet mystified colleagues such as Walter Runciman, Edwin Montagu, and Lloyd George (who blamed him for the Liberals' poor showing in the January 1910 election). But Asquith, appreciating his loyalty, saw him as the man to carry forward the government's programme of franchise and electoral reform. When Pease's <span class="roman">Franchise Bill</span> foundered on the rocks of women's suffrage in January 1913, his dismay, like Asquith's, was tempered by relief that votes for women had been thwarted without splitting the government. A bigger disappointment was his failure as president of the Board of Education to enact major educational reforms. His appointment in October 1911 coincided with the departure of the permanent secretary, Sir Robert Morant. Pease reshuffled the senior staff of the ministry, choosing a team led by L. A. Selby-Bigge that responded well to a competent, congenial, and considerate chief. With George Newman, Pease greatly expanded school medical services. He strengthened the board's relations with teachers and improved professional training. When war came he encouraged his new parliamentary secretary, Christopher Addison, in mobilizing the nation's scientific and industrial research resources.<br>
<br>Remaining in the cabinet which made the decisions for war with Germany in 1914 was deeply troubling for Pease. He tried unavailingly to dissuade his son from enlisting, and was an early supporter of the Friends' Ambulance Unit. But he resigned from the presidency of the Peace Society and thenceforth publicly defended the government's position. Pushed to the margins of high policy making, he undertook relief co-ordination tasks and introduced educational and leisure activities in army training camps, overcoming ill-judged resistance from Lord Kitchener. A casualty of the May 1915 coalition, Pease served as an unpaid member of the War Claims Commission in France. He was embarrassed by the need to seek a political pension, but by late 1915 he had secured a &pound;2000 a year consultancy by placing his coal industry expertise and political connections at the disposal of his old friend Christopher Furness.<br>
<br>An invitation to rejoin the government as postmaster-general (outside the cabinet), following Sir John Simon's resignation and Herbert Samuel's promotion in January 1916, delayed Pease's return to active business life. But revived hopes of political advancement were effectively extinguished by the formation of the Lloyd George coalition. Ennobled (3 January 1917) as Baron Gainford in the Asquith resignation honours, Pease became a leading figure in the post-war industrial world. He spoke for the Mining Association of Great Britain before the coal industry commission in 1919 and was elected president of the Federation of British Industries for 1927&#150;8. As a &#145;prominent public man unconnected with any of the constituent companies&#146;  (Gainford MSS) he was asked to chair the infant British Broadcasting Company in 1922. He became a radio enthusiast, and was deputy chairman and a governor of the corporation from 1927 to 1932.<br>
<br>Well known in his retirement for his fishing (and a related concern for water conservation), hunting, shooting, and embroidery, Pease made faltering attempts to write his memoirs. His journals from 1908 to 1915, unknown to scholars for fifty years, are a revealing chronicle of Liberal politics. He died at his home, Headlam Hall, Gainford, co. Durham, on 15 February 1943.<br>
