<span class="headword">Robertson,  James  Logie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Hugh Haliburton]</span>  (1846&#150;1922), <span class="occ">literary scholar and author</span>, was born on 18 September 1846 in the village of Milnathort, Kinross-shire, the second son of William Robertson, a shoemaker, and Mary Logie. After elementary schooling at Orwell parish school he continued there as a pupil&#150;teacher from the age of thirteen, going on to training college in Edinburgh. After teaching practice at Haddington, Logie Robertson returned to Edinburgh and attended the university, where he was a distinguished student, winning prizes ranging from the rhetoric medal to the Murchison prize in geology; he graduated MA in 1872. He began his teaching career as assistant master at Heriot's Hospital, became assistant master at George Watson's College in 1872, then (in 1876) first English master at Edinburgh Ladies' College (later the Mary Erskine School), where he remained until his retirement in 1914. He married Janet Simpson (<i>b</i>. 1859/60), a former dux of Edinburgh Ladies' College, on 16 August 1881; she records in her memoir of him that he was drawn to teaching girls by their &#145;more subtle intellectual response&#146; to literature  (Robertson, vii).<br>
<br>Logie Robertson is an important figure in the reinvigoration and renationalization of Scottish cultural life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As well as editions of the poems of Allan Ramsay, James Thomson, Burns, Scott, and Thomas Campbell, he published a selection from the work of the great fifteenth-century Scots poet William Dunbar. <span class="italic">Dunbar: a Selection from the Poems of an Old Makar Adapted for Modern Readers</span> (1895) excludes some of the poet's best work on account of its &#145;coarseness&#146;, and much else is robbed of its vigour and technical audacity by being &#145;translated&#146; into Burnsian forms and language&#151;or into English, but the edition does point forward to the inspiration which a later generation of Scots poets were to find in the Middle Scots makars generally, and Dunbar in particular. Through his regular contributions to <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> and to other periodicals Logie Robertson worked tirelessly to promote interest in Scottish literature and culture, while his series of articles in W. E. Henley's brilliant but short-lived <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span> in 1888&#150;9, reveals a sharp awareness of the connections between the state of a language and culture, and contemporary social and economic conditions. In this series, the writer's fictitious informant on &#145;The Revolution in the Rural Districts&#146;, one Gibbie Doss, a stonebreaker, uses a vigorous, colloquial Scots.<br>
<br>The disintegration of rural communities through the growth of the &#145;muckle-farm system&#146; which is chronicled in the <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span> articles is, however, scarcely reflected in the Scots pastorals which brought Logie Robertson widespread popularity in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. In the volume which contains them only some satirical references to the lairds, to long-separated lovers, and a brief concluding pastoral drama in which a wealthy returning emigrant extols the opportunities offered by Australia, give any indication of crisis in the rural economy. Supposedly composed by one Hugh Haliburton, shepherd of the Ochil hills, the poems began to appear in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> in 1881, with each new poem being eagerly awaited. Included in <span class="italic">Our Holiday</span> in 1882, they were added to and collected in volume form in 1885 and 1900 as <span class="italic">Horace in Homespun</span>. Logie Robertson's work was linked with that of Stevenson (whose 1887 volume <span class="italic">Underwoods</span> contained a substantial body of verse in Scots) as heralding a revival of the vernacular verse tradition. Despite believing that lowland Scots was in retreat as a result of Anglicizing pressures operating particularly in education, and holding that it would survive only as a literary language, Stevenson and Logie Robertson helped to ensure the continuity of the vernacular tradition, and so played a part in creating the conditions for the vigorous flowering of poetry in lowland Scots which took place in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>The language of the pastorals blends literary with contemporary regional Scots, but Logie Robertson follows Stevenson in rejecting dialect purism. Although its basis is in the Scots of the Ochils, the vernacular he employs is regionally as well as historically eclectic, anticipating the more radically &#145;synthetic&#146; methods of later Scots poets. The poems are prefaced with brief quotations from Horace's odes, and for the nineteenth-century classically educated reader much of their appeal would have been derived from the interplay between the Scots poems and the Latin &#145;originals&#146;, for these are not translations but transpositions, in which the sophistication of tone, density of reference, and technical virtuosity of the Roman poet are replaced by hearty simplicities of sentiment and idiom. Logie Robertson is at his best in poems like &#145;Packie's Return&#146; and &#145;The Tinklers&#146; when he draws on his own close observation of country life or when, as in &#145;The White Winter&#146;, he is giving imaginative life to scientific speculation in a way which anticipates the use of a &#145;cosmic viewpoint&#146; by C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid)&#151;geology was a lifelong interest of Logie Robertson's, and the distinguished geologist Archibald Geikie a personal friend.<br>
<br>Like other members of the group associated with Henley and the <span class="italic">Scots Observer</span> (Stevenson, Barrie, and Andrew Lang were the most prominent), Logie Robertson's enthusiasm for Scottish culture was situated within a unionist and imperialist framework. In <span class="italic">A History of English Literature</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">An Outline of English Literature for Young Scholars</span> (1897), the literature of lowland Scotland is seen as a part, albeit a distinctive one, of a larger English-language tradition, and Logie Robertson edited selections of Chaucer, Milton, and Tennyson, as well as the work of Scottish poets. If their unionism and imperialist sympathies once seemed to divide his generation from the left-leaning Scottish intellectuals of the post-First World War period, it was possible by the end of the twentieth century to see how much they resembled each other in their commitment to rediscovering and reasserting Scotland's cultural identity, and to the belief that their country had a distinctive contribution to make to a developing international order. Logie Robertson died at his home at 1 Braidburn Crescent, Edinburgh, on 13 June 1922 after a long illness, and was buried in the Morningside cemetery, Edinburgh. He was survived by his wife.<br>
