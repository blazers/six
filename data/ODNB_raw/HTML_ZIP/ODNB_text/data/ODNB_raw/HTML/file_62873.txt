<span class="headword">Wells,  William</span>  (1768&#150;1847), <span class="occ">shipbuilder and art collector</span>, was born at Canister House, Chislehurst, Kent, the second of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64870/', "William Wells (1729&#150;1805)")</script>, shipbuilder, and Susanna Neave (<i>d</i>. 1810). His ancestors had been connected with shipbuilding from the seventeenth century. Wells loved the sea and cultivated a rollicking sea captain's walk, even though he only once commanded a ship, on a voyage to China in 1794&#150;5. Joseph Farington, the noted diarist, explained that it was not lack of opportunity that led Wells to give up his career on the high seas, but family obligations&#151;he was needed to supervise the building of battleships at his family's shipyards at the Blackwall docks during the Napoleonic wars and to supervise their investment in Meux brewery. Wells sold his shipbuilding interests in 1811 and retired with his wife, Mary Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1818), to Redleaf, Penshurst, Kent, where he spent his time gardening, hunting, and adding to his art collection. He was an active member of the Church of England.<br>
<br>Wells inherited paintings from his grandfather, who had commissioned marine subjects from Charles Brooking, and from his father (whose portrait was engraved by Sir Joshua Reynolds). He added a large selection of old masters, on which he spent over &pound;18,000. He began to add modern pictures to his collection after his retirement, purchasing paintings directly from William Mulready, Thomas Webster, and David Wilkie. Most of his attention, however, was directed at Edwin Landseer, from whom he bought almost thirty pictures, and at the young landscape painter Frederick Richard Lee, who provided nearly fifty. Wells selected paintings which were compatible with what he already owned: for instance, his animal scenes by Landseer harmonized with the bovine and equine subjects he had acquired by such Dutch seventeenth-century artists as Cuyp, Wouwerman, and Berchem, while Lee's untroubled landscapes blended in with the Hobbemas and Claude Lorrains which were already in place at Redleaf. His insistence on measuring his contemporary purchases against his old masters rankled with John Constable. The artist vented his frustration in a letter written to his friend C. R. Leslie on 2 March 1833: &#145;I had, on Friday, a long visit from Mr. Wells alone. He saw hundreds of my things&#151;I sincerely believe nothing amongst them made any impression upon him or did they come into his rules, or whims, of the art&#146;  (<span class="italic">Constable's Correspondence</span>, 94).<br>
<br>Wells shared many of the biases of his class in preferring art that did not deviate too far from the traditional norm. A trustee of the National Gallery and a director of the British Institution, he preferred artists such as Landseer, who had trained himself to model his habits after those of the upper classes. Landseer became a permanent fixture at Redleaf, where his patron had a special painting seat constructed for him in his garden. Landseer's deeply toned paintings were more in accord with Wells's taste than anything in Constable's studio, or in Turner's for that matter. Wells told Constable that he thought &#145;Turner was &#147;quite gone&#148;&#151;lost and possessed by a yellow which he could not see himself, therefore could not avoid&#146;  (<span class="italic">Constable's Correspondence</span>, 97). Yet the fact that Wells collected the works of contemporary artists at all indicates that he was sensitive to the emerging dynamism of the early-Victorian middle class which was beginning to make its mark in matters of taste, politics, and finance. Childless, Wells died at Redleaf on 7 August 1847, aged seventy-nine years, leaving his estate to his grandnephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29019/', "William Wells (1818&#150;1889)")</script>, whose agricultural experiments depleted most of his fortune. Following his death, Wells's collection was sold at Christies on 10&#150;14 May 1890.<br>
