<span class="headword">Ashby,  George</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1385?, <em>d.</em> 1475), <span class="occ">administrator and poet</span>, was of unknown origins. Many of the details of his life have to be deduced from his surviving poems, but they are borne out by record evidence. In &#145;The Active Policy of a Prince&#146;, written for Edward, prince of Wales (<i>d</i>. 1471), probably in 1463, he claims to be &#145;Right nygh at mony yeres of foure score&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashby's Poems</span>, 15), that is, nearly eighty, which would make his date of birth shortly before 1385. In &#145;A Prisoner's Reflections&#146;, also to be dated 1463, Ashby says that he grew up in &#145;the hyghest court that I coude fynd&#146; with Henry VI, Margaret of Anjou, and Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and that he had written in their signet offices<blockquote>
<div class="indent">full fourty yere<br>
</div>
<div>As well beyond the see as on thys syde.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Ashby's Poems</span>, 3)</blockquote>During the minority of Henry VI he appears to have worked for Duke Humphrey, but in 1437, when the king took charge of his own affairs, Ashby moved to the royal signet office as one of its four clerks. In June 1438 he was granted the office of constable of Dynefwr Castle, Dyfed, while in 1439 he went to Calais with the king's secretary, Thomas Beckington (<i>d</i>. 1465), and was paid &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. of the king's gift as his expenses. In July 1441 he was granted &pound;10 yearly for life until recompensed with an office of the same or greater value, and in 1446 he was made steward of Warwick. In 1444 he had been one of the embassy that brought Margaret of Anjou to England, and Queen Margaret later wrote to an unidentified lady thanking her &#145;for service to George Ashby, Clerk of Our Signet&#146;  (Margaret of Anjou, 114). In 1459 he represented Warwick in the Lancastrian-dominated parliament held at Coventry. He was in the Fleet prison, possibly because of his Lancastrian sympathies, in 1463, and since he says he had been there &#145;a hoole yere and more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashby's Poems</span>, 2), he may have been committed in 1461 or 1462 after the Yorkist takeover.<br>
<br>It was while Ashby was in prison that he wrote his surviving poems, first published by Mary Bateson in 1899. In &#145;A Prisoner's Reflections&#146; Ashby addresses his own situation. He says he was unjustly imprisoned &#145;By a gret commaundment of a lord&#146;, that many lies were told about him, that he had been deprived of property and reduced to penury, and that he had been reviled with &#145;vnfyttyng langage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashby's Poems</span>, 1&#150;3). But he determines to school himself to &#145;patience&#146; and to see in his suffering a &#145;lesson&#146; which may benefit himself and others. &#145;The Active Policy of a Prince&#146; is a much longer and more ambitious poem, and seeks to advise Prince Edward, the Lancastrian heir to the throne, on the proper conduct of a ruler. Much of the advice is of a very conventional sort, and Ashby makes extensive use of the <span class="italic">Liber de dictis philosophorum antiquorum</span>, a collection of proverbial maxims: sometimes he quotes the Latin and then translates it. But sometimes he addresses the contemporary situation precisely: advice to &#145;bryng vp ayen clothe makyng&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashby's Poems</span>, 29), and to regulate the apparel of his future subjects, are consistent with many of the proposals set out in the sumptuary legislation of 1463. Like many fifteenth-century poets Ashby praises Gower, Chaucer, and Lydgate&#151;not only for their aureate language, as was usual, but also for the new stanza forms they had devised. He acknowledges their pre-eminence and says he follows them &#145;not as a master but as a prentise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashby's Poems</span>, 14), which is not a bad self-estimate.<br>
<br>Ashby was evidently released from prison without facing trial. He died on 20 February 1475 and was buried in Harefield, Middlesex, where he owned a small estate called Breakspeares. According to their funeral brass in Harefield church, Ashby's wife was Margaret, who died on 24 September 1474. He left a son John, who died in 1496. A grandson George, who followed his grandfather's profession and was a clerk of the signet under Henry VII and Henry VIII, died on 5 March 1515.<br>
