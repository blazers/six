<span class="headword">Boner,  Charles</span>  (1815&#150;1870), <span class="occ">poet and journalist</span>, was born at Weston, near Bath, on 29 April 1815, the second child and only son of Charles Antonius Boner (1759&#150;1833), and his wife, Maria. Boner was educated at Bath from 1825 to 1827, and then at Tiverton grammar school from 1827 to 1829. From 1831 to 1837 he was tutor to the two elder sons of John Constable, the painter. Boner became a close friend of the Constables, organizing the painter's private affairs, and helping him research and write his lectures on landscape painting.<br>
<br>After his mother's death in 1839, Boner accepted an invitation to join Baron August Doernberg in Germany. The following spring he accompanied the baron to Regensburg, where he accepted the offer of a post in the family of the Prince Thurn und Taxis. Boner, who shared the prince's passion for art and literature, spent twenty years in the family of Thurn und Taxis, and became intimate with a large number of the prince's friends.<br>
<br>Boner travelled widely throughout Germany and Austria, and devoted himself to the study of the German language. In 1844 he was contracted by the London <span class="italic">Literary Gazette</span> for a series of articles on the German poets. Boner's facility in the language of his adopted country was widely admired, and his translations into English, notably of the German versions of Hans Christian Andersen's tales, <span class="italic">A Danish Story Book</span> (1846) and <span class="italic">The Dream of Little Tuck</span> (1848), were held to be remarkably faithful and idiomatic. In August 1845 Boner was introduced to Mary Russell Mitford, and the two writers embarked on a literary correspondence that was to last for a decade. A number of Mitford's letters to Boner, many offering constructive criticisms of Boner's work, are printed in Rosa Kettle's <span class="italic">Memoirs and Letters of Charles Boner</span> (1871).<br>
<br>While in the service of Thurn und Taxis, Boner came to love the forests and mountains of Bavaria, and his experiences as a naturalist and huntsman are recorded in <span class="italic">Chamois Hunting in the Mountains of Bavaria</span> (1853). Boner's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> reveal that <span class="italic">Chamois Hunting</span> was scrutinized in manuscript by Mary Russell Mitford. In 1855 Boner composed the letterpress to <span class="italic">English Landscape Scenery</span>, a collection of engravings by John Constable. In the same year he translated Professor Masius's work from the German as <span class="italic">Studies of Nature</span>. Boner also turned his hand to verse, publishing <span class="italic">Cain</span> in 1855, <span class="italic">The New Dance of Death and other Poems</span> in 1857, and <span class="italic">Verses</span> in 1858.<br>
<br>Boner left Regensburg in 1860 and settled in Munich. In 1863 he travelled through Transylvania. A detailed account of his studies there, <span class="italic">Transylvania, its Products and People</span>, was published in 1865, and later translated into German. On 27 February 1865 Boner's daughter Marie married Professor Theodor Horschelt (1829&#150;1871), the Munich painter who twelve years earlier had supplied the illustrations for <span class="italic">Chamois Hunting</span>. In September 1865 Boner left Munich for Vienna as special correspondent of the London <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. While in Vienna, he contributed articles to a number of other newspapers, including the <span class="italic">New York Tribune</span>. In 1867 he went to Salzburg to be present at the meeting of Napoleon III and the emperor of Austria, and wrote a very graphic description of the scene. He later attended the funeral in Trieste of the emperor Maximilian, of whom he compiled a memoir. Boner died in Professor Horschelt's house at Louisenstrasse 5, Munich, on 9 April 1870.<br>
