<span class="headword">Brown,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1671&#150;1705), <span class="occ">legal writer</span>, is very difficult to identify. In dedicating his <span class="italic">The Entering Clerk's Vade Mecum</span> (1678) to Thomas Robinson (later first baronet), chief protonotary of the court of common pleas, Brown referred to &#145;my sixteen years experience (as clerk of your office)&#146;. Thus it would appear that Brown began his service shortly after the Restoration. As late as his <span class="italic">Privilegia parliamentaria</span> (1704) he was described as &#145;a clerk of the court of Common Pleas&#146;. It seems likely from this fact that he was of insufficient status to be identified with any of his namesakes who were educated in the inns of court after the Restoration.<br>
<br>Brown's stock-in-trade consisted of books of tutorials for the aspiring clerk, books of precedents, and manuals for public officials such as justices of the peace. His first work appears to have been <span class="italic">Formulae ben&eacute; placitandi: a Book of Entries, Containing Variety of Choice Precedents</span>, published in 1671, which had a second edition in 1675. <span class="italic">Modus intrandi placita generalia: the Entring Clerk's Introduction</span> followed in 1674, with a second edition in 1687. <span class="italic">The Entering Clerk's Vade Mecum</span> followed in 1678. Further guides and collections of precedents followed. After the revolution he appears to have branched out, publishing in 1705 <span class="italic">Astraeae abdicatae restauratio, or, Advice to Justices of the Peace</span>, but the method was the same, a compendium of information.<br>
<br>Brown was rarely an original writer. He edited works by William Sheppard, and the preface to Brown's <span class="italic">Methodus novissima intrandi placita generalia</span> (1699) revealed something of his method. He had waited thirty years to obtain the drafts of William Gardiner, late of Barnard's Inn, another clerk of the common pleas, which he now presented to the public.<br>
<br>Brown's date of death is unknown, but the will of a &#145;William Browne of the Middle Temple&#146; was proved in October 1712. Writing on 20 April 1712, the author describes himself as &#145;gent&#146;, and refers to &#145;my circumstances being in not so good a condition as I could wish&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/529, sig. 180), and to chambers in Fig Tree Court in the Temple, which he had purchased from Denham Pritherick for life, and now rented to Sam Provost. He himself lived in Brick Lane in the Temple, and left a wife, Elizabeth, and a brother, Robert.<br>
