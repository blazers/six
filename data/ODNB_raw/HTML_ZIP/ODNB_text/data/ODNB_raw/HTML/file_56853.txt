<span class="headword">Morgan,  Frederick Charles</span>  (1878&#150;1978), <span class="occ">antiquary and book collector</span>, was born on 29 June 1878 at 11 High Street, Stratford upon Avon, the sixth of nine children of John Morgan (1830&#150;1908), bookseller and printer, and his second wife, Mary Kibler (1846&#150;1929). After attending Stratford grammar school until the age of thirteen, he assisted his father in running a circulating library. In 1902 John Morgan printed <span class="italic">The Campden Wonder</span> and <span class="italic">An Account of the Battle of Stratford-upon-Avon</span>, both edited by his son, but in the following year he closed his business. F. C. Morgan obtained a part-time post at the Shakespeare Memorial Library and subsequently at the Stratford Public Library. During these years his delight in antiquarianism began to develop with cycling expeditions into the Cotswolds. He became an ardent admirer of William Morris, collected illustrations of Morris's craftsmanship, and visited Kelmscott; he later claimed that Morris's <span class="italic">Earthly Paradise</span> (1870) exactly fitted his political ideas.<br>
<br>In 1910 Morgan was appointed librarian at the new public library in Malvern where, in 1911, he organized the first exhibition of children's books, many of which came from his own collection, which eventually contained over a thousand examples dating from the early eighteenth century. In 1954 this was given to the Baillieu Library at Melbourne University. The catalogue for the exhibition was revised and republished in 1976. On 29 August 1914 Morgan married Emma (1877&#150;1967), daughter of Richard Jones, of Radbrook, near Clifford Chambers, Warwickshire; their only daughter, Penelope, was born in 1916. While at Malvern, Morgan made contact with several eminent local botanists and geologists and met the Herefordshire antiquary Alfred Watkins. During the First World War he served with the Royal Garrison Artillery.<br>
<br>Morgan was appointed librarian and curator of the art gallery and museum at Hereford in 1925 and thus began his connection with the cathedral city with which his reputation is inextricably linked. For the next half-century he dominated antiquarian pursuits in his adopted county and revealed through his many publications the rich vein of documentary sources and archaeological artefacts which lay uncatalogued and unexplored in the institutions of the county town and the countryside which surrounded it. Through his wide contacts he built up an outstanding reference library but he was also proud of his achievements as curator: he established an important collection of English topographical paintings and, with the help of his wife, a famous collection of English costumes. He found an outlet for his researches in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club, the Herefordshire archaeological society, and during his life he held all the executive offices of the club, including president in 1937 and 1951. Morgan pioneered an interest in vernacular architecture, and published several articles illustrated with his own photographs; he was especially depressed by the spate of demolitions of timber buildings after the Second World War, fighting hard to convince the authorities of their worth.<br>
<br>Long before the age of record offices, Morgan was actively seeking archive material, preserving it and making it publicly available at the Hereford Reference Library. Many documents were carefully transcribed and printed in the Woolhope <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. While fire-watching on the roof of the library during the Second World War he began the major task of cataloguing and transcribing the muniments of the city of Hereford. The result after thirteen years was a ten-volume calendar of the city records from <i>c</i>.1500 to 1700.<br>
<br>In 1945 Morgan retired but now embarked upon a catalogue of the printed books of the famous library of Hereford Cathedral, together with the 30,000 items in its archive. He was assisted here by his daughter, Penelope. He remained honorary librarian until his death in Hereford on 16 July 1978. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral on 20 July. F. C. Morgan produced 165 books, pamphlets, and articles which were listed in a catalogue published by his friends to mark his 100th birthday. He received many honours: fellow of the Library Association (1910), FSA (1938), an honorary MA from Birmingham University (1952), and chief steward of the city of Hereford (1975). His important photographic collection was shared by the cathedral and city libraries in Hereford, and the National Monuments Record. In honour of its most famous member the Woolhope Club inaugurated an annual F. C. Morgan lecture.<br>
