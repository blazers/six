<span class="headword">Ker, Sir  Walter, of Cessford</span>  (1510&#150;1582), <span class="occ">border chieftain and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15445/', "Andrew Ker of Cessford (d. 1526)")</script> and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Sir Patrick Crichton of Cranstoun Riddel. His father was killed near Melrose in 1526 by a follower of Sir Walter Scott of Branxholm, during an unsuccessful attempt to free James V from the guardianship of the earl of Angus. Sir Andrew's death gave rise to a bitter feud between the Kers and the Scotts. Walter's uncle, George Ker of Faldonside, acted as his tutor until he was served heir on 12 May 1528, aged eighteen. Cessford was cup-bearer to James V from 1528 to 1536 and occupied the office of warden of the Scottish middle march, with a jurisdiction which encompassed Teviotdale, during the years 1535&#150;8, 1542&#150;51, and 1558&#150;70. His position as a border law officer did not, however, prevent his engaging in reiving. The lands of Cessford and Primside in Morebattle parish, Roxburghshire, were created free baronies for him in 1542. He married Isobel (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1585), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15446/', "Andrew Ker of Ferniehurst")</script>, before 27 September 1543. They had six children: Sir Andrew Ker of Caverton; William Ker of Cessford, who succeeded his father as warden; Thomas; Agnes, who married John Edmonston of that ilk; Isobel, second wife of John Rutherford of Hunthill; and Margaret, who wed Alexander, fifth Lord Home.<br>
<br>During the so-called &#145;rough wooing&#146; Cessford faced intermittent accusations of collaboration with the English, but on 15 October 1545 he appeared before the council to bind himself to the defence of the nation. Following the Scots defeat at Pinkie on 10 September 1547, however, Cessford submitted to the duke of Somerset at Roxburgh and assured to England. The English exploited his feud with the Scotts to enlist him in raids on Newark Castle and the Buccleuch lands in January 1548. Then in October the Kers burnt Catslack Tower and with it Lady Elizabeth Ker, mother of Walter Scott of Branxholm and also Cessford's own great-aunt. England's grip on the borders was subsequently undermined by French intervention and Cessford was replaced as warden by Scott of Branxholm in 1550, exacerbating the tension between the two men. Knighted by Governor Arran in June 1552, on the evening of 4 October following he avenged his father when with his friends he stabbed Scott of Branxholm to death on Edinburgh High Street, Hume of Cowdenknowes urging Cessford to &#145;strike for thy father's sake&#146;  (Fraser, 2.210). The murderers were outlawed, but on 8 December the crown elected to banish them to France, ordering the Kers to raise 100 horsemen to serve in the continental wars. Their exile was never enforced and a remission was eventually granted on 16 May 1553. On 28 August 1559 Cessford was appointed a commissioner to treat with the English for the ransom of prisoners of war. He joined the protestant lords of the congregation at Leith in April 1560 and sat in the Reformation Parliament. He was frequently censured throughout Queen Mary's reign for his failure as warden to provide adequate redress to people complaining of breaches of the march laws, a failure partly caused by the refusal of his kinsman, Sir Thomas Kerr of Ferniehurst, and his followers to co-operate with him. There was rarely any consistency about relationships among the Ker chiefs, whose long-standing rivalry in the middle march often set them against each other.<br>
<br>In March 1564 a contract arranging marriages between the Kers and the Scotts was made to settle their feud, and Cessford was required to seek the laird of Buccleuch's forgiveness for the murder of the latter's father in St Giles's Kirk, Edinburgh. Significantly, Cessford and Ferniehurst only agreed to stand surety for their own followers, rather than for all of their surname. Like the majority of the realm, Cessford remained loyal to the crown during the chaseabout raid, the revolt by the earl of Moray and duke of Ch&acirc;telherault in 1565. However, after the queen married the earl of Bothwell in 1567 he opposed her later that year at Carberry Hill, and in 1568 fought valiantly with the king's men at Langside, alongside his son-in-law Lord Home. As a committed protestant Cessford was a natural supporter of Moray's regency, and he assisted the regent's expeditions to suppress Liddesdale in 1569. By contrast Ferniehurst, who had reconverted to Catholicism in the late 1560s, remained loyal to Mary and between 1570 and 1573 acted and was virtually recognized by the English as warden of the middle march. Cessford avoided direct confrontation with him, and in July 1570 pragmatically allowed a Marian raid on Wark, led by Ferniehurst and Buccleuch, to pass and return through that march unchallenged. Despite agreeing to ride against Ferniehurst in February 1571, Cessford made no direct response to his kinsman's attempts to burn Jedburgh, perhaps as a result of his own differences with the Rutherfords among the townsmen. However, he joined with Lord Ruthven's force, which rode from Leith to Jedburgh's rescue in February 1572, and was present at the convention which elected the earl of Morton regent in November.<br>
<br>Four years later Morton antagonized Cessford by seeking to divide the area of the middle march under his jurisdiction, and in August 1578 Sir Walter accompanied the earls of Atholl and Argyll when they rode from Edinburgh to Stirling to secure the regent's deposition before the king. When recommended for an English pension in March 1580 Cessford was noted to be a man &#145;of great power, constant, stout, valiant&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1574&#150;81</i>, 386). Appointed a gentleman of the king's bedchamber in October, he initially favoured the duke of Lennox's regime but evidently grew disenchanted, for he signed the secret band which preceded the Ruthven raid in 1582. He died some time later that year and was probably buried in Bowden parish church.<br>
