<span class="headword">Sewell,  Richard Clarke</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1803, <em>d.</em> 1864), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Sewell (1775&#150;1842), a solicitor, of Newport, Isle of Wight, and his wife, Jane Edwards (1773/4&#150;1848). Among his eleven siblings were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36028/', "James Edwards Sewell")</script>, warden of New College, Oxford, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25142/', "Henry Sewell")</script>, first premier of New Zealand, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25148/', "William Sewell")</script>, a Church of England clergyman, and the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36027/', "Elizabeth Missing Sewell")</script>. He was baptized at Newport on 6 February 1803, and entered Winchester College in 1818. He matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 26 July 1821, was a demy of his college from 1821 until 1837, and a fellow from 1837 to 1856. He served as senior dean of arts in 1838, as bursar in 1840, and was vice-president and praelector of natural philosophy in 1842. He graduated with a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i>, BA 1826, and proceeded MA 1829, and DCL 1840. He was awarded the Newdigate prize for poetry in 1825. On 25 June 1830 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, became known as a special pleader, and took business on the western circuit and at the Hampshire sessions.<br>
<br>Tragedy overtook the family in 1842 when Sewell's father died, leaving large debts which the family undertook to clear. This may have influenced Sewell's decision to go to Australia towards the end of 1855. On 7 February 1856 he was admitted to the Victorian bar, where he gained considerable eminence, chiefly in criminal cases, including his leading the prosecution of one of the murderers of John Price, the notorious inspector-general of prisons, in April 1857. From May to August 1856 he edited the <span class="italic">Victorian Law Times and Legal Observer</span>, and from February 1857 he was reader in law at the new University of Melbourne, but the demands of his practice forced him to resign in July.<br>
<br>Sewell published extensively in Britain and Australia. His writings were mainly on legal subjects, but, like his brother William, he was also interested in the rights and constitutional position of the Anglican church, on which he published a work in 1848. For the English Historical Society, Sewell edited <span class="italic">Gesta Stephani</span> (1846). Making available this invaluable source on the reign of King Stephen was helpful, but the source itself was incomplete until missing parts were discovered in the latter half of the twentieth century, which discovery made earlier editions redundant.<br>
<br>Sewell died unmarried on 7 November 1864 in Melbourne and was buried the following day in Melbourne general cemetery.<br>
