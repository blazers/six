<span class="headword">Robertson, Sir  George Scott</span>  (1852&#150;1916), <span class="occ">administrator in India and politician</span>, was born in Southwark on 22 October 1852, the second son of Thomas James Robertson, pawnbroker, formerly of Rousey, Orkney, and his wife, Robina Corston, daughter of Robert Scott of Kirkwall, Orkney. Educated at Westminster Hospital medical school, he entered the Indian Army Medical Service in 1878, and was with the Kabul field force throughout the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&#150;80). For the next eight years he was a civil surgeon with the Indian medical services. In 1882 he married Catherine Edith (1863/4&#150;1886), daughter of Colonel Alexander John Edwin Birch, with whom he had one daughter, Gwendoline.<br>
<br>In 1888 Robertson entered the Indian foreign department when he was chosen by Captain Algernon Durand as companion on a mission to northern Kashmir to investigate hostilities between Kashmir and its tributaries, Hunza&#150;Nagar, and to visit the other parts of Dardistan. There were underlying political objectives: to ascertain the growth of Russian influence, to emphasize the advantages of Indian government intervention, and to present recommendations on how to bring stability to the warring tribes. The two men travelled throughout the region; they were welcomed with ceremonies, involved in long negotiations, and were successful in achieving allegiances with promises of government subsidies.<br>
<br>It was a mission of four months during which a close bond developed between the two men: Robertson&#151;two years the senior&#151;tall, calm, resourceful, quiet-spoken; Durand&#151;handsome, clever, impulsive, burdened with the family tradition of Indian service. The Indian government accepted Durand's recommendations: the British agency in Gilgit was reopened in 1889 with Lieutenant-Colonel Durand as political agent and Surgeon-Major Robertson as medical officer.<br>
<br>In October 1889 Robertson, interested in making a study of Kafiristan, the isolated buffer state between Afghanistan and Chitral, undertook a preliminary visit, which with governmental approval was followed by an extended stay. From October 1890 to September 1891 he lived among the Kafirs. It was an exhausting visit: he suffered from intrigues, thieving, and threats, and, though not a total prisoner, was rarely allowed to travel beyond one village. His understated description of the Kafirs was that their cupidity, jealousy of one another, and proneness to quarrel made it difficult to live among them.<br>
<br>Robertson had little occasion to promote the advantages of Indian intervention, but ample opportunities to study a pagan society. Throughout he remained resolute and patient, developing particular skills in negotiating, and achieved some success in securing their acceptance of him. When he left, six Kafirs accompanied him as guests of the government on an educational visit to India. His confidential report appeared in 1894, and his <span class="italic">Kafiristan and its People</span> in 1895. His major work, <span class="italic">The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush</span>, was published in 1896&#151;an impressive ethnographical study and graphic account of his solitary experiences.<br>
<br>Robertson arrived back in Gilgit to find extensive preparations under way for a punitive expedition against Hunza&#150;Nagar. There were particular difficulties with these two small states&#151;societies based on brigandage and slave trading, inaccessible cliffside forts&#151;which were actively welcoming Russian and Chinese advances. Durand's proposed action to prevent an inheritance dispute erupting into general violence received governmental approval and he planned the advance into the mountain ravines with precision. On the first day of the campaign, in the attack on the Nagar fortress, he was severely wounded: his plans were not followed, and there was confusion and the possibility of retreat. Robertson, taking over as chief political officer, kept the force in position for twenty days, ending in the capture of Nagar and Hunza. Durand acknowledged to Lord Roberts that Robertson's strength of will and his determined support of the actions of junior officers had ensured success.<br>
<br>Durand stayed on in Gilgit, never completely recovering from his wound and without his earlier assurance. When he took long recuperative leave, Robertson took charge. With governmental approval he embarked on an active campaign, travelling south to visit small states in the Indus valley. He was attacked, retaliated, crossed the Indus, burned the fortress of Chilas, was besieged, and &#145;with the sublime disregard for odds which characterised him, [he] attacked in his turn with about eighty men and routed the enemy&#146;  (Durand, <span class="italic">The Making of a Frontier</span>, 368). Chilas, astride the Indus valley, came under British control. At the end of 1894 Robertson became British political agent in Gilgit when Durand's career as a frontier officer ended.<br>
<br>In Chitral on 1 January 1895 the <i>mehtar</i> (ruler), Nizam al-Mulk, was murdered by his half-brother, Azim al-Mulk, who was acknowledged as his successor. Opposing forces gathered quickly under the leadership of Umra Khan, an ambitious Pathan chief. There was also a rival candidate, Sher Afzul, who had Afghan support, and there seemed every prospect of escalating conflict throughout the region. Robertson was instructed to march to Chitral, but not to intervene if he considered Azim's position was accepted. Travelling by forced marches, he and his small force arrived on 31 January. With the group was Azim's brother Shuja al-Mulk, aged sixteen.<br>
<br>It was difficult to remain neutral with Umra giving support to Sher Afzul and marching against Azim al-Mulk. In a complex situation of intrigue and treachery Robertson aimed to establish the British position with a forthright decision: at a gathering in Chitral he declared Azim to be replaced as <i>mehtar</i> by the young Shuja, subject to the approval of the Indian government. It was a declaration not accepted by Umra Khan and Sher Afzul. Robertson and his forces, Shuja, his family, retainers, and treasures, withdrew to Chitral fort. Robertson sent out a reconnaissance force, which was ambushed, retreating in confusion into the fort. They were besieged by the Chitralis and Umra Khan's forces: from 4 March to 20 April 1895 more than 500 people, including more than 100 non-combatants, endured and existed. Aid came relatively fast and from two directions: from Gilgit a force under Colonel James Kelly, and from the south an army under Sir Robert Cunliffe Low.<br>
<br>The responsibility over the weeks of the siege rested with Robertson as political officer, with Captain Colin Powys Campbell, badly wounded, and Captain Charles Vere Ferrers Townsend in military command. Robertson's diary provides a record of endurance and bravery, discipline and camaraderie, resourcefulness and ingenuity in combating boredom and despair. At first Robertson expected reinforcements from the northern garrisons, and was fully occupied, rejecting false peace offers, finding ways to send messages, using all his negotiating skills during short periods of truce. There were frightening attacks from the besiegers, dangerous sorties for water, the almost disastrous mining of the tower: and overall there was the awfulness of their conditions, the resilience of the British officers, the bravery of the Sikhs. On 19 April their captors left, and next day Kelly and his force arrived. Tales of the siege captured the imagination of the British public; Robertson's own vivid account was published as <span class="italic">Chitral: the Story of a Minor Siege</span>. There were awards to the British officers and the Indian troops involved, and Robertson was made KCSI.<br>
<br>Robertson returned to England on furlough and, to the surprise of his friends, never returned to India. New prospects in business, politics, and science claimed his attention. In 1894, his first wife having died, he married Mrs Mary Gertrude Bird, a widow and the daughter of Samuel Laurence, the portrait painter. In 1897 he was in Canada at the British Association for the Advancement of Science sixty-seventh annual meeting in Toronto, receiving the honorary degree of DCL from Trinity University.<br>
<br>Robertson's parliamentary ambitions faltered with defeat in the 1900 election in Stirlingshire, but he was successful as Liberal candidate for Central Bradford in 1906, and was returned in 1910. He was not a prominent parliamentary speaker, but was a good constituency MP of advanced views (he advocated female suffrage, payment for MPs, and more working men in parliament). In parliament he took a close interest in all matters relating to India; in 1914 his intimate knowledge of Indian soldiers was of value on special missions to France. He was also a successful businessman, actively involved in two manufacturing companies. He died in London on 2 January 1916 having been in poor health since 1914, and was buried on 7 January at Golders Green cemetery. He was survived by his second wife and daughter.<br>
