<span class="headword">Oldfield,  Thomas Hinton Burley</span>  (1755&#150;1822), <span class="occ">political reformer and historian</span>, was born in Derbyshire. The identity of his parents remains undiscovered and very few details of his personal life are known, except that he fathered several children, two of whom became merchants in Baltimore. Having earned a living practising law, Oldfield is referred to in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as &#145;an attorney of great celebrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 566), although his name is unknown to the law list. As a lawyer, Oldfield was actively engaged in politics as an election agent for candidates, a duty which encompassed the important responsibility of organizing and managing local campaigns. From 1777 Oldfield maintained a close association with various groups for parliamentary reform, including the Society for Constitutional Information, earning a reputation as a zealous pioneer of parliamentary reform. His connection with these societies ensured his familiarity with many reformers of the day, but it was, according to his obituary, his &#145;cheerful temper&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, 178) which particularly endeared him to friends like Sir George Saville, John Jebb, Christopher Wyvill, Granville Sharp, Major John Cartwright, and John Horne Tooke.<br>
<br>As an author Oldfield found another vent for his political beliefs, and was quite productive and influential in this pursuit despite the somewhat disparaging reference to him, by one contemporary, as &#145;an obscure writer on the Boroughs&#146;  (Mathias, 30). His first book chronicled <span class="italic">An Entire and Complete History, Political and Personal, of the Boroughs of Great Britain</span> (3 vols., 1792), and was followed by a <span class="italic">History of the Original Constitution of Parliaments</span> (1797). Oldfield continued to expound the ideas of electoral reform through such historical treatises as a <span class="italic">History of the House of Commons</span> (4 vols., 1812), <span class="italic">The Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (6 vols., 1816), and <span class="italic">A Key to the House of Commons</span> (1820). Oldfield did not publish any further works before his death on 25 July 1822 at the age of sixty-seven. The cause of death and place of burial remain unknown, and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> present conflicting accounts of the place where Oldfield passed away, with the former suggesting he died in Exeter on his way to the Cornwall assize and the latter stating that he expired at his apartments in Skinner Street, London.<br>
