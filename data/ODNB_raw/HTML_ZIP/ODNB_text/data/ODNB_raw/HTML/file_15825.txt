<span class="headword">Kinder,  Philip</span>  (<em>b. </em>1597, <em>d.</em> in or after 1665), <span class="occ">writer and physician</span>, was born on 12 April 1597, the second son of William Kinder (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1623), of Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, and Katherine, daughter of William Dunn of Nottingham. His father had graduated from Brasenose College, Oxford, with a degree in medicine, and Philip chose the same profession, graduating from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1616 with a licence to practise medicine, which he was doing &#145;from his chamber by the East gates in Leicester&#146; by 1620, apparently following Paracelsian principles  (MS Ashmole 788, fol. 48; MS Ashmole 429, fol. 43). At some point he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Barkley of Warwickshire, but there were no children.<br>
<br>After his father's death in 1623, Kinder moved back to Sneinton, and by 1629 he was receiving an annuity of &pound;20 p.a. from the Pierrepoints, a powerful family of that town. For reasons probably arising from Kinder's lack of deference, this relationship turned to mutual hostility which eventually caused Henry Pierrepoint and three of his servants to attack Kinder in the cloister of Westminster Abbey in the year 1630. According to Kinder, who took his case to the Star Chamber, they had meant to kill him. Pierrepoint received a royal pardon, and, despite further suits, Kinder was unable to receive satisfactory compensation for his injuries.<br>
<br>In 1640 Kinder was at York with the king's army, probably in the service of the Hastings family of Ashby-de-la-Zouch. He completed a detailed survey of the monuments in York Minster, but the manuscript was lost at Nottingham in 1643  (MS Ashmole 788, fol. 188). After the outbreak of the civil war, the royalist cavalry commander Henry Hastings appointed Kinder to be his agent at the Oxford court, but Kinder complained of being ill rewarded for his services. In 1649 he contributed a Latin memorial inscription and a short English poem to <span class="italic">Lachrymae musarum</span> (1649), the memorial volume for Hastings's nephew. Kinder was in the garrison of Ashby Castle when it fell to the parliament in 1646. In the period 1650&#150;54 Kinder was at Aston upon Trent; his fortunes were at a low ebb, and he had to remind various influential acquaintances of their promises of money and help.<br>
<br>Kinder wrote Latin, studied Greek and Hebrew, and understood Spanish and Italian. His own writings in verse and prose, Latin and English, include some unusually accomplished verses as well as drama, topography, genealogy, astrology, and literary criticism. Throughout his life he composed Latin epitaphs for his friends, family, and acquaintances.<br>
<br>While at university Kinder had written a Latin comedy, &#145;Silvia&#146;, and a theological treatise which survives in his miscellany. He also composed &#145;The Ball&#146;, a text for a revel or series of danced entries representing the ancient and modern poets  (MS Ashmole 788, fols. 205, 103, 3). In 1629 he contributed a Latin elegiac verse to a posthumous volume of verse by his friend and correspondent Sir John Beaumont of Grace Dieu  (J. Beaumont, <span class="italic">Bosworth-Field</span>, 1629). In 1628 he began to develop his &#145;Trismegeticall Invention&#146;, a &#145;Universal Character&#146; consisting of a system of number-symbols with which, he claimed, any document could be translated into at least ten languages within two hours. In this he anticipated the 1653 <span class="italic">Logopandecteision</span> of Sir Thomas Urquhart, and like Urquhart he composed a pedigree for himself beginning with Adam and continuing &#145;without intermission of Centurie or name&#146;  (Kinder, <span class="italic">Surfeit</span>, 28&#150;30; MS Ashmole 788, fols. 50&#150;51, 162).<br>
<br>Probably in the 1630s, and as a bid for royal patronage, Kinder composed &#145;Eugenia&#146;, a Latin treatise that purports to trace the descent from the protoplast Adam, &#145;of all the Emperors, Kings and Princes of the universal world&#146;  (Kinder, <span class="italic">Surfeit</span>, 23&#150;4). His royalism also expressed itself in the hagiographic tone of his Latin life of Charles I and his fine verses &#145;The Antiparode&#146; which end &#145;Honour and Beautie are but Dreames / Since Charles and Mary lost theire Beames&#146;  (MS Ashmole 788, fol. 22<i>v</i>). In his &#145;Terminalia&#146; he prophetically interprets the writings of Esdras, John the Divine, Merlin, Ambrose, and St Malachias the Primate as histories of the world, the church, England, and the papacy  (MS Ashmole 788, fols. 64&#150;102). In 1636 he provided prefatory verses for William Sampson's <span class="italic">Virtus post funera vivit</span>. He may have translated Boethius's <span class="italic">De consolatione philosophiae</span>  (MS Ashmole 788, fol. 171).<br>
<br>In the 1650s he composed a pair of treatises, the first upholding papism from the church fathers, the second protestantism. Kinder's purpose was to show the irrelevance of the patristic authors to modern religious controversy  (Kinder, <span class="italic">Surfeit</span>, 10&#150;13). At about the same time, he also wrote &#145;The Court of Astraea with the Arraignment of Romances&#146;, which looks back to the bonfire of the romances in <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>, and forwards to Boileau's &#145;Les h&eacute;ros de roman&#146; (written in 1666). In 1656 there appeared his only published work, <span class="italic">The Surfeit to ABC</span>, a series of meditations on books and ideas, including the observation that historians of classical antiquity are too na&iuml;ve in their use of literature as evidence:<blockquote>As if one in future ages should make all <i>England</i> in ages past to be a <i>Bartholomew</i>-Faire, because <i>Ben. Johnson</i> hath writ it. Or that the condition of all our <i>English</i> women may be drawn out of <i>Shackespeers</i> merry wifes of <i>Windsor</i>. (Kinder, <span class="italic">Surfeit</span>, 58)</blockquote>As well as being an astronomer, Kinder was an expert in the &#145;art of <i>shadowes</i>&#146;: he produced logarithmic calculations for &#145;sun-dialls&#146; and an <i>ad hoc</i> method for calculating the time by measuring shadows  (Kinder, <span class="italic">Surfeit</span>, 60&#150;61; MS Ashmole 788, fols. 206, 210). His miscellany manuscript contains not only literary and antiquarian material but also accounts of prophecies and of a vision seen on the night of 16 November 1658  (MS Ashmole 788, fol. 102).<br>
<br>In 1658&#150;60 Kinder was living at Wilson, near Melbourne in Derbyshire. By 1661 he was living at Walton-on-Trent where he consolidated his epistolary friendship with Charles Cotton, who encouraged him to write his best-known work, the project for a &#145;History of Darby-shire&#146; (1663). About 1662 he moved back to Nottingham, whence he wrote his last dated letters in 1665.<br>
