<span class="headword">Nugent,  Richard</span>, second earl of Westmeath  (1626&#150;1684), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the only son of Christopher Nugent, styled Lord Delvin (<i>c</i>.1604&#150;1625), and his wife, Lady Anne MacDonnell (<i>d</i>. before 1676), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17461/', "Randal MacDonnell, first earl of Antrim (d. 1636)")</script>. On his father's death Richard Nugent became heir to his grandfather, also <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20397/', "Richard Nugent (1583&#150;1642), first earl of Westmeath")</script>. In or before 1641 he married Mary (1623&#150;1672), daughter of Sir Thomas Nugent of Moyrath.<br>
<br>In England at the time of his grandfather's death in 1642, Westmeath was detained at Beaumaris while seeking passage to Ireland. He was not permitted to proceed home until after the cessation of September 1643 between the confederate Catholics and the earl of Ormond, Charles I's representative in Ireland. In July 1645 he raised a regiment of infantry and a troop of horse to take part in the proposed confederate expeditionary force to Cheshire to assist Charles I. When the expedition was cancelled in the spring of 1646, the expeditionary regiments were incorporated into the confederate armies, with Westmeath being commissioned as a colonel in the Leinster army. In December 1646, at the confederate blockade of Dublin, he and Clanricarde acted as go-betweens for Ormond in the latter's attempt to detach the Leinster army from its allegiance to the confederate supreme council and foil the proposed attack on Dublin. The attack was abandoned, but Westmeath was subsequently reconciled to the confederates. He was present, on 7 August 1647, with most of his regiment at Dungan's Hill when the Leinster confederate army was destroyed by the parliamentarian commander Michael Jones. He was taken prisoner but subsequently exchanged for Viscount Montgomery. In 1648 he again sided with the Ormondist party against the papal nuncio, Rinuccini, and the clericalist party during the renewal of confederate internal conflict, heading the list of those recorded as taking the June 1648 oath to uphold the supreme council against Rinuccini's excommunication. In October 1648 he was appointed one of the commissioners to negotiate a peace treaty with Ormond, concluded the following January. Westmeath was appointed a field marshal by the supreme council in January 1649 and by 1650 had been given command of all forces in Leinster within the new pan-royalist alliance headed by Ormond. Following Ormond's departure for France in December 1650, Westmeath gave his support to Ormond's deputy, the earl of Clanricarde.<br>
<br>Westmeath's conduct of the war was the subject of criticism from the clericalist party. He was, claimed the author of the &#145;Aphorismical discovery&#146;, &#145;a man that never gathered an army into the field since he was appointed general, nor any party did stick unto himself that did act worth 6<i>d</i>.; rather worked all the means possible for faction, dispersion, rent, and division&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Contemporary history</span>). He was blamed for not taking proper measures for the defence of Finnea, for not relieving Ballynacargy, co. Cavan, and for bringing about the surrender of his Leinster army to parliament on 12 May 1652, on conditions known as the articles of Kilkenny. That there may have been truth in the clericalist jibes is suggested by his subsequent petition to parliament that he be allowed to keep his estate, or a portion of it, because of his loyalty &#145;so different from all other Catholics of this Nation&#146; and because &#145;he attended to the advancement &amp; interests of England&#146;. Although listed among those to be excluded from pardon for life and estate by the <span class="roman">Act for the Settling of Ireland</span> of August 1652, on 13 April 1653 he obtained an order to enjoy such parts of his estate as lay waste and undisposed of, and on 16 November the order was extended to the enjoyment of a full third of his estate. Having raised his regiment for the Spanish service as permitted by the articles of Kilkenny, he obtained a pass permitting him to transport himself and two servants, with travelling arms and necessaries, to and from Flanders, provided he gave notice of his arrival to the governor of the place where he should first land. He appears to have taken advantage of this permission. On the apprehension of fresh disturbances in the summer of 1659 he was, with other leading royalists, placed under arrest. He recovered his liberty and his estates at the Restoration, but seems to have taken no further interest in politics. In 1680 he rebuilt the chapel of Fore, to be a place of burial for himself and his posterity, and, dying in 1684, was interred there.<br>
<br>Besides two sons who died in infancy, Westmeath had four sons and five daughters. Christopher, Lord Delvin, his eldest son, married Mary, eldest daughter of Richard Butler of Kilcash, co. Tipperary, and, predeceasing his father, left Richard, third earl of Westmeath, who died in holy orders in 1714; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20401/', "Thomas Nugent, fourth earl of Westmeath (1668/9&#150;1752)")</script>; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20391/', "John Nugent, fifth earl of Westmeath (1671/2&#150;1754)")</script>. The second earl's other children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20400/', "Thomas Nugent, created Baron Nugent of Riverstown (d. 1715)")</script>; Joseph, a captain in the service of France; William, MP for County Westmeath in 1689, and killed at Cavan in 1690; Mary, who married Henry, second Viscount Kingsland; Anne, who married, first, Lucas, sixth Viscount Dillon, and, secondly, Sir William Talbot of Cartown, co. Meath; Alison, who married Henry Dowdall of Brownstown, co. Meath; Elizabeth, who died young; and Jane, who married Alexander MacDonell, called Macgregor of Dromersnaw, co. Leitrim.<br>
