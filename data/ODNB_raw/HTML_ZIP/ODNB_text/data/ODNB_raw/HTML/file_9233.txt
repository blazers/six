<span class="headword">Fazakerley,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1682, <em>d.</em> 1767), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized on 26 February 1682 at Broughton, near Preston, Lancashire, the eldest son of William Fazakerley, a gentleman, of Kirkby, Lancashire. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 12 March 1702 but went down on 12 January 1703 without taking a degree. He was admitted to Middle Temple on 13 May 1700 and called to the bar on 23 May 1707. He was admitted to Inner Temple in 1716 and on 22 November 1734 to Lincoln's Inn where he was elected bencher on 25 June 1736. He became master of the walks in 1741, keeper of the black book (the records of the inn) in 1742, dean of the chapel in 1744, treasurer in 1747, and in 1748 master of the library. From 1738 to 1757 he held the office of counsel to the University of Cambridge. He practised from chambers in Hare Court, Temple, until November 1734, when he moved to 11 New Square, Lincoln's Inn. Fazakerley was returned unopposed as member of parliament for Preston on 24 January 1732, and held that seat until his death. His only preferment came in August 1742, when he was appointed recorder of Preston. On 10 October 1723 he married Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17230/', "Sir Thomas Lutwyche")</script>, member of parliament for, successively, Appleby, Callington, and Amersham. They had a son, who died on 30 June 1737  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), and a daughter, Elizabeth, who on 23 December 1744 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16541/', "Granville Leveson-Gower, Viscount Trentham")</script>.<br>
<br>Fazakerley first came to public notice when he appeared with Thomas Bootle in 1731 as counsel for the defence in the trial of Richard Francklin, a Fleet Street printer and publisher of <span class="italic">The Craftsman</span>, for publishing an anti-government letter said to have been written by Lord Bolingbroke. Fazakerley and Bootle in their conduct of that case &#145;started every objection and laboured every point as if the fate of the empire were at stake&#146;  (Campbell).<br>
<br>Horace Walpole's description of Fazakerley as &#145;a tiresome Jacobite lawyer&#146; is undiscriminating, for his political principles, while those of a tory, are not easy to classify. His subscribing &pound;200 towards raising the Lancashire militia during the Jacobite rising of 1745 seems inconsistent with support for the Jacobite cause  (Thomas Starkie to Lord Derby, 21 Oct 1745, MSS DDK/1741, Lancs. RO). An inveterate Jacobite might have been expected to do nothing, and it is unsurprising that he took no part in the negotiations between the Jacobite leaders and the French government from 1740 to 1745. Furthermore, after the failure of the attempted French invasion at the beginning of 1744 he introduced into parliament a bill making treasonable any correspondence with the sons or descendants of the pretender. When the bill was returned from the Lords to the Commons Fazakerley, in the course of the debate, &#145;denounced as one of the most pernicious and unconstitutional provisions ever devised&#146; a government amendment, introduced in the upper house, to extend &#145;the attainder and corruption of blood, to the children of those who should be convicted under the act&#146;  (Coxe).<br>
<br>Fazakerley's role <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the bill against treasonable correspondence suggests that his political principles were rooted in opposing the administration, and he voted against the government in every recorded division during the reign of George II. Of importance in this respect was his signing the circular letter of 20 December 1743 appealing to opposition members to be present to vote against the Hanoverian troops when parliament reassembled after Christmas  (BL, Add. MS 29597, fol. 29). Some further insight into Fazakerley's politics may be provided by his supporting, together with other prominent tories, the programme for reform of Frederick, prince of Wales, which was published on 4 June 1747. Included in the programme were measures for the &#145;Abolition of party distinctions, [the taking] away of any Proscriptions of any Set of men who were friends of the Constitution &hellip; [the raising] and establish[ing] of a militia throughout the country [and an] Enquiry into abuses of offices&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35870, fols. 129&#150;30). Fazakerley's support for the prince of Wales's programme places him among those tories who after 1747 began to identify with the heir apparent rather than with the pretender.<br>
<br>Fazakerley's opposition to the administration's bills often sprang from his belief that they were inimical to the health of the constitution. This was his theme when taking a leading part in the debate on the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in May 1751. That bill was introduced after the death of Frederick, prince of Wales, in March 1751, and was intended to cover the contingency of his son's succeeding before he had attained his majority. Fazakerley argued that rule by a regency council would lead to faction but that there should be a council for the regent, Augusta, princess of Wales, to consult with and to advise her when she desired it. During the course of 1753 he spoke against both Lord Hardwicke's marriage bill and that for the naturalization of the Jews. Fazakerley died at his house in Grosvenor Street, Westminster, in February 1767.<br>
