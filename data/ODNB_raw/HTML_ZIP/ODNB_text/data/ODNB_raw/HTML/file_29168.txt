<span class="headword">Wharton,  Edward Ross</span>  (1844&#150;1896), <span class="occ">philologist and genealogist</span>, was born at Rhyl, Flintshire, on 4 August 1844, the second son of Henry James Wharton (1798&#150;1859), vicar of Mitcham, whose ancestors had long been settled at Winfarthing in Norfolk. His mother was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6456/', "Thomas Peregrine Courtenay")</script>. He was educated as a day boy at Charterhouse, where he was captain of the school, under the headmastership of Richard Elwyn, and elected to a scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford, in 1862, graduating BA in 1868 and MA in 1870. Though never robust in health, and suffering at this time from weak eyesight, he had a distinguished university career. In his second year he won the Ireland scholarship, though for the Hertford and Craven he came out only proxime. He was placed in the first class in classical moderations, and also in the final classical school. In 1868 he was elected to a fellowship at Jesus, which he was obliged to relinquish after his marriage in 1870 to Susanna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1899), daughter of Samuel Hicks Withers of Willesden. He was connected almost continuously with the college until his death, as assistant tutor and Latin lecturer, and was re-elected to a fellowship after the change in statutes in 1882. He devoted himself to acquiring a thorough knowledge of both Latin and Greek, to which he added an understanding of the cognate languages.<br>
<br>Wharton's first book was <span class="italic">Etyma Graeca</span>, an etymological lexicon of classical Greek (1882), which lists with minimal explanation the derivations of about five thousand common words. <span class="italic">Etyma Latina</span> (1890) was similarly constructed, but included an appendix showing the changes that letters undergo in the cognate languages as well as in Latin. He also contributed several papers to the London Philological Society and to the French Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Linguistique. His other published works were translations of Aristotle's <span class="italic">Poetics</span> and book i of Horace's <span class="italic">Satires</span>.<br>
<br>Wharton was a keen walker, especially in the British Isles and the Alps. He met Karl Baedeker in Koblenz, and made numerous suggestions for early editions of his guides. During the last few years of his life much of his interest was transferred to genealogy. The results of his researches, largely among original documents, are contained in six manuscript volumes, which he bequeathed to the Bodleian Library, dealing with all who had borne the name of Wharton or Warton. A short sketch of the baronial family of Wharton of Wharton Hall in Westmorland, which he had finished just before his death, was printed by his widow as a memorial volume. He died at 3 South Parks Road, Oxford, on 4 June 1896, and his remains were cremated at Woking. He had no children.<br>
<br>A younger brother, <a name="cosubject_29168"></a><span class="headword">Henry Thornton Wharton</span>  (1846&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Mitcham, was educated at Charterhouse and at Wadham College, Oxford, where he graduated with honours in natural science in 1871. He was best known for a book on Sappho&#151;memoir, text, selected renderings, and a literal translation (1885)&#151;which passed through four editions. He was also one of the joint compilers of the official list of British birds issued by the British Ornithologists' Union (1883), his special task being to supervise and elucidate the Latin nomenclature; and he contributed a chapter on the local flora to a work entitled <span class="italic">Hampstead Hill</span> (1889). He died on 22 August 1895 at his home, Madresfield, 2 Acol Road, Hampstead, where he had practised for some years as a surgeon (MRCS, 1874). He left a widow, Caroline Wharton, and was buried in the neighbouring Hampstead cemetery in Fortune Green.<br>
