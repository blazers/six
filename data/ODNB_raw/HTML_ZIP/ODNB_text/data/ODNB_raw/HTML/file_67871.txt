<span class="headword">Higgs,  Eric Sidney</span>  (1908&#150;1976), <span class="occ">sheep farmer and archaeologist</span>, was born on 26 November 1908 in Oldbury Wells, near Bridgnorth in Shropshire, the elder son of Sidney Higgs, carpet designer, and his wife, Florence Annie Price, whose family ran a building and haulage firm. He was educated at Bridgnorth grammar school, and took a BComm at the London School of Economics. After periods of unemployment and a spell as a professional card player, he worked in London as a specialist in the waterproofing of buildings and railway tunnels. During this period he lived in Kent and kept horses. After his first marriage, on 29 May 1936 to Marion Bett (<i>b</i>. 1900/01), daughter of William Edward Bett, a Russian jute merchant, and the birth of their only daughter, he returned to Shropshire at the outbreak of the Second World War to take up sheep farming at Clee St Margaret. His farming was largely self-taught and during the war years the government compelled him to grow food crops. He founded the Brown Clee Club, a local discussion group for politics, drama, and poetry reading, travelled with the French agronomist Ren&eacute; Dumont throughout France and Spain, and later with his farmer friend and neighbour Michael Osler visited Yugoslavia and Greece, where he first encountered the transhumant Vlachs of the Pindus Mountains.<br>
<br>In 1954 Higgs moved to Cambridge to read the two-year postgraduate diploma in prehistoric archaeology under Charles McBurney and Grahame Clark. In 1956 he was appointed assistant in research in the department of archaeology and anthropology, and his new home at 35 Panton Street became the focus of undergraduate supervisions and the plotting of summer fieldwork campaigns. Shortly afterwards, in 1958, he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. So began the longest period of his adult career at an age and in conditions of health when others would have put their feet up in early retirement. In 1963 he became senior assistant in research, and assistant director of research in 1968.<br>
<br>As a late entrant to the academic profession Higgs brought fresh thinking to a discipline that he felt had become over-obsessed with studying the minutiae of artefact form, and which relied on other scientific disciplines with little interest in the human factor to supply information on the environmental background. He was convinced that the archaeological record could not be properly understood without a better understanding of the basic economy. He also believed that archaeology should address a wider public and the more general threats to human survival in the modern world. He lectured to the Workers' Educational Association, gave radio and television broadcasts, and advocated the importance of an archaeological perspective in distinguishing factors of long-term importance from the short-term noise of cultural choice.<br>
<br>Higgs became an expert on the study of animal bones from archaeological sites and pioneered an approach that is now a cornerstone of professional practice. Animal bones should not be thrown away or handed over to some scientific specialist but studied by archaeologists as primary data capable of yielding as much information about human activities as conventional artefacts. He founded the Cambridge &#145;Bone Room&#146;, and with his assistant, Don Allen, taught generations of students the rudiments of animal-bone identification.<br>
<br>In 1962 Higgs launched a field project in northern Greece to search for palaeolithic sites in a country where almost none were then known. Discovery of the enigmatic &#145;red beds&#146; of Kokkinopilos in Epirus and subsequent excavations at the rock shelters of Asprochaliko and Kastritsa opened up a rich prehistoric record. This work stimulated new ideas about prehistoric economy, the study of site locations in relation to local landscape settings, and the importance of mobility as a primary human adaptation to regional and seasonal variations in food supply. In 1968 he was awarded the Rivers medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, and in 1994 a square in the old part of the city of Ioannina was named after him.<br>
<br>From 1967 to 1976 Higgs directed the British Academy major research project on the early history of agriculture. Teams of research assistants and students were dispatched to collect animal bones and plant remains from ongoing excavations throughout Europe and the Near East and to conduct site catchment walks in the surrounding landscape. The results, published in a series of edited volumes&#151;<span class="italic">Papers in Economic Prehistory</span> (1972), <span class="italic">Palaeoeconomy</span> (1975), and <span class="italic">Early European Agriculture</span> (1982)&#151;documented the novel view that plant and animal domestication were not discoveries of recent millennia diffusing out from a revolutionary centre of origin in the Near East. Rather they were part of a continuing process of worldwide economic adaptation, which extended from earliest prehistory up to the modern period under the impetus of inexorable population growth and technological change.<br>
<br>In Higgs's archaeological years, his hunched back and balding, domed head belied a youthful approach to life allied with an impish sense of humour. He encouraged his students to challenge established orthodoxy and inspired them with confidence to venture into new territory. Fieldwork was carried out every summer in nomadic style from an operational base in the family Land Rover with his second wife, Helen Pauline Tippett (<i>b</i>. 1936), whom he married in 1964, a chemist by training who had first analysed the red sediments of Kokkinopilos, and their children, all three of whom were brought up on the experience of fieldwork. Spartan living conditions and long hours in the field taxed those much younger and fitter than him. Students and younger colleagues alike were charmed and challenged into feats of unaccustomed accomplishment or endurance, lightened by his tales of a wider world beyond academe and by a farmer's insights into past and present land use. By 1975 his chronic heart condition worsened and after a slow decline he died at his home, 35 Panton Street, on 23 September 1976, his wife surviving him. He was buried at Clee St Margaret.<br>
