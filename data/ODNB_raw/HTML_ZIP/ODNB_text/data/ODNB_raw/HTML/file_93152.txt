<span class="headword">Pike,  (Irene) Mervyn Parnicott</span>, Baroness Pike  (1918&#150;2004), <span class="occ">businesswoman, politician, and voluntary worker</span>, was born at Highmere, Whitwood Mere, Whitwood, Castleford, Yorkshire, on 16 September 1918, the second child and only daughter of Ivan Samuel Pike (1867&#150;1934), managing director of Clokie and Co., a pottery works, and his wife, Alice Goodhead (<i>d</i>. 1956). Known as Mervyn, after her intended godfather who fell in action days before her birth, she studied at Hunmanby Hall, in Filey, Yorkshire, before taking a first-class degree in economics and psychology from the University of Reading in 1941. That same year she joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, in which she served for the remainder of the Second World War, becoming a flight sergeant responsible for crew selection.<br>
<br>After the war Pike succeeded her mother as Clokie's managing director and, encouraged by the local Labour chief, followed her father onto the local parish council. By 1950 her dislike of the government's centralization and controls led her to become a Conservative, but she retained the desire to improve social conditions that had attracted her to Labour. She was elected unopposed to Yorkshire West Riding county council but had to be persuaded by the party chairman, Lord Woolton, to run for parliament, feeling that local government was where people's lives could be improved. After standing in Pontefract and Leek in 1951 and 1955 respectively, she finally landed the safe tory seat of Melton, Leicestershire, at the by-election of December 1956 necessitated by the Foreign Office minister Anthony Nutting's resignation over the Suez d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. The nomination of a woman outsider in this traditional, rural constituency stirred controversy, and some party members withheld their support, but the party's decreased majority was blamed on Suez and she was praised for holding the seat.<br>
<br>Pike had a brisk, robust manner and set rigorous standards, yet remained fun to work with. Colleagues appreciated her energy, enthusiasm, and humour, and she enjoyed hosting generous dinner parties for friends. However, she had a low parliamentary profile and some were surprised by her rapid rise, as she became a parliamentary private secretary at the Home Office in early 1957, and assistant postmaster-general in October 1959. Despite joking that this formidable title kept her from finding a husband (she never married), Pike, one of parliament's few businesswomen, enjoyed overseeing reforms at one of Britain's largest institutions. These reforms were both cosmetic&#151;brightening the uniformly brown and cream post office interiors and replacing traditional metal grilles with glass&#151;and practical, like shortening queues by abolishing the counter clerks' specialization, and separating its finances from the exchequer. During the tories' last eighteen months in power Pike was parliamentary under-secretary at the Home Office, but soon after their defeat in October 1964 she left the front bench for a directorship with the major Devon-based ball clay company Watts Blake Bearne. There she helped to introduce a successful new approach to union relations.<br>
<br>In 1966 Pike became the most senior woman Conservative in a decade, as shadow minister for social services. She was an innovator&#151;one of the first MPs to have an office computer&#151;and a brain-stormer whose spontaneity, bordering on impetuosity, could alarm those with slower thought processes. Her pamphlet <span class="italic">Needs Want</span> (1967) reflected her original thinking and position as one of the party's liberals, drawing upon her voluntary experience with the National Council of Social Services and the Child Guidance Council. She rejected the tory orthodoxy that poverty was due to &#145;feckless work and reckless breeding&#146;, and recommended targeted payments rather than family allowances and claw-backs. She also persuaded her party to support the use of voluntary organizations to address social problems. In 1967 she left the shadow cabinet permanently, facilitating Margaret Thatcher's rise as the party's &#145;statutory&#146; woman front-bencher, but she went on to develop intellectual links between the party and conservative academics. Through this network, and as chairman of the Conservative Systems Research Centre, she did much to shape the Conservatives' economic proposals which contributed to their surprise election victory in 1970. Despite her back-bench status there was none the less surprise when she did not receive a ministerial appointment&#151;for private health reasons&#151;and her chief political legacy was therefore made in opposition, not government.<br>
<br>In 1974 Pike left the Commons to replace her friend Lady Reading as chairman of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service (WRVS). She was made a life peer, as Baroness Pike, in the dissolution honours of April 1974. She rarely spoke in Lords debates, but her political contacts helped the WRVS, and as she undertook its reform, her tactics enabled her almost always to get what she wanted. As usual she brought fresh ideas to her task, introducing such projects as a victims' support scheme in the courts and contact centres where divorced fathers could see their children. In addition she gave the WRVS uniform a more feminine look, encouraged the recruitment of more men, and appointed the first male vice-chairman. Her devolution of authority and fostering of greater professionalism in the WRVS's work made a lasting difference. Despite her having to oversee some difficult economizing and restructuring, this period was the happiest of her life and she greatly invigorated a somewhat hidebound wartime institution.<br>
<br>On leaving the WRVS in 1981 Pike was made a DBE, and held her last public appointment as the first chairman of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, from 1981 to 1985. Here she drew upon her experience as chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority's general advisory council from 1974 to 1979. After leaving public life she remained in Hownam, Kelso, where she had lived since the 1970s as a popular &#145;lady of the manor&#146; with Dame Susan Walker (her long-time companion and a former senior Conservative official), enjoying walking and gardening. She died of pneumonia, following a stroke, on 11 January 2004 at Queens House nursing home, Kelso, and was buried at Hownam. She never married.<br>
