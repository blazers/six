<span class="headword">Knight,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1606?), <span class="occ">mariner</span>, was described by Captain James Hall of Hull as &#145;my Countrie-man&#146;; beyond this, his origins remain obscure. In 1605 he sailed on a voyage of exploration to Greenland. The fleet was commanded by John Cunningham, a Scot employed by Christian IV of Denmark. Cunningham sailed in the admiral <i>Trost</i> with James Hall as his pilot. The vice-admiral the <i>R&oslash;de L&oslash;ve</i> was captained by a Danish nobleman Godske Lindenov, while Knight was steersman of the pinnace <i>Katten</i> or <i>Marekatten</i>.<br>
<br>The ships left Copenhagen on 2 May 1605. The <i>Trost</i> sighted the coast of Greenland in latitude 59&deg;50' on 30 May, but the fleet's attempts at exploration were hampered by ice and fog. The <i>R&oslash;de L&oslash;ve</i> parted company on 11 June and returned to Copenhagen with skins and narwhal ivory. Meanwhile the <i>Trost</i> and <i>Katten</i> reached an area of coastline without ice, and bartered goods with the Inuit in the Itivdleq Fjord. Hall and Knight sailed away in the pinnace to explore and map the harbours between the latitudes of 66&deg;30' and 68&deg;35', surviving skirmishes with Inuit. The islands at latitude 66&deg;59' were named after Knight. On 11 July the two ships started home through the ice, and arrived in Copenhagen on 10 August.<br>
<br>In 1606 Knight undertook a voyage on behalf of the English East India and Muscovy companies in search of the north-west passage. He commanded the <i>Hopewell</i>, a pinnace of 40 tons, which sailed from Gravesend on 18 April making for the Orkney Islands, where bad weather detained the ship until 12 May. The voyage was uneventful until 3 June, when the <i>Hopewell</i> met with the ice floes that were to hamper her progress. In his journal Knight describes the daily battle with the ice, and how his men manoeuvred the <i>Hopewell</i> through narrow gaps with spars, boat-hooks, and oars. Land was sighted on 13 June, but two days later the ship was nearly crushed, tossed by high winds and stormy seas against the ice. On 19 June the <i>Hopewell</i> reached land at latitude 56&deg;48' on the coast of Labrador. Knight managed to steer into a cove where a storm on 24 June broke off the rudder, flooded the ship, and drove her aground.<br>
<br>Knight's journal ends abruptly: &#145;Thursday the 26th beinge faire wether&#146;. Another hand has added an explanation. On the morning of 26 June 1606 Knight rowed to an island and went ashore with three others, taking instruments for mapping and weapons to defend themselves if necessary. Two sailors left in the shallop waited until eleven o'clock at night but Knight and his men did not return. The remaining eight crew members attempted a search for their colleagues, but were thwarted by the ice. They patched up the <i>Hopewell</i> sufficiently to sail to Newfoundland for repairs and arrived in Dartmouth on 24 September 1606. Evidence given by the crew at a high court of admiralty inquiry in November that year satisfied the sponsors of the voyage that the loss of Knight and his men was not the result of desertion or mutiny.<br>
