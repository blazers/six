<span class="headword">&Oacute; Rathaille,  Aodhag&aacute;n</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1729), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet</span>, was born in Sliabh Luachra, co. Kerry, where his family leased lands from the MacCarthy family at Scrahanaveele, a little over 10 miles east of Killarney. Nothing is known of his parents, but it is suggested that his father may have been from co. Cavan and that he married a woman from the Sliabh Luachra area. The MacCarthys were an old Gaelic family who were, at the time of &Oacute; Rathaille's birth, subtenants of Sir Nicholas Browne, viscount of Kenmare. It would appear that &Oacute; Rathaille was born into a position of privilege and that he was educated at Captain Eoghan MacCarthy's house at Headford, where he would have been tutored in the manner of the Gaelic professional poets of previous centuries. It seems certain that he would also have spent a good deal of time in Glenflesk, at the castle of the O'Donoghues, themselves a notable literary family, and in the big houses of the remaining Gaelic aristocracy in east Kerry and west Cork. As well as giving him training as a poet, this privileged background gave &Oacute; Rathaille a knowledge of English, Latin, perhaps a little Greek, and a familiarity with the literature of post-Renaissance Europe.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Rathaille's world was to collapse into chaos, however, after the battle of the Boyne in 1690. Sir Nicholas Browne, who had supported the Jacobite cause and the Catholic King James in the Williamite wars, had his estate confiscated and tenants such as the MacCarthys and the &Oacute; Rathailles were evicted from their homes. In his poem &#145;Cr&eacute;achta Chr&iacute;ch F&oacute;dla&#146; (&#145;The wounds of the Land of F&oacute;dla&#146;), &Oacute; Rathaille laments the demise of the MacCarthy family and beseeches God to come to the assistance of &#145;majestic gentle-mannered Erin&#146; who is portrayed as being ravished by &#145;foreign churls&#146;. Another poem <span class="italic">An Milleadh d'imthigh ar Mh&oacute;r-shleachtaibh na h&Eacute;ireann</span> (&#145;The ruin that befell the great families of Erin&#146;) portrays Ireland &#145;As a land which wolves have spitefully devoured, a land placed in misfortune and subjection, beneath the tyranny of mercenaries and robbers&#146;. It was against this background of upheaval that, about 1708, &Oacute; Rathaille found himself and his family having to move to the area of Corca Dhuibhne in west Kerry where he wrote his great lyric <span class="italic">Is Fada Liom O&iacute;che Fh&iacute;rfhliuch</span> (&#145;The drenching night drags on&#146;). Here, he portrays himself as being reduced to eating &#145;dogfish and periwinkles&#146; and he rages against the sound of the waves which crash below him at night during a storm, crying at the end: &#145;Were Help to come again to fair Erin, I would thrust thy discordant clamour down thy throat.&#146; In this poem he equates his own desperate plight with the plight of the Gaelic nation as a whole and this is echoed in his later work. It should be noted, however, that the autobiographical reading of this poem, and of &Oacute; Rathaille's work as a whole, has recently been questioned by B. &Oacute; Buachalla and it is probable that &Oacute; Rathaille was never reduced to anything like the grinding poverty suggested here.<br>
<br>In the years that followed &Oacute; Rathaille, then moving between counties Kerry, Cork, and Limerick, composed a number of <i>aisling</i> or vision poems. Typically in <i>aisling</i> poetry the poet encounters a beautiful but distressed woman-queen who awaits the return of the rightful Stuart king to free her from bondage and, often, she leaves the poet with a message that help is imminent. The <i>aisling</i> was to become the most popular form among eighteenth-century Gaelic poets, but &Oacute; Rathaille was perhaps the greatest practitioner of the genre, transcending as he did what, in the hands of lesser poets, was often a repetitious formula. One of his earliest <i>aisling&iacute;</i> was <span class="italic">Gile na Gile</span> (&#145;Brightness most bright&#146;), a remarkable poem in which the beautiful maiden tells the poet &#145;of one returning by royal right&#146;, later referred to as &#145;a man most fine, thrice over, of Scottish blood&#146; who will free her from &#145;that black, horned, foreign, hate crested crew&#146;. The overall atmosphere of the poem, however, is one of despair and there is a feeling of great anxiety throughout the poem which does not indicate any great hope on the part of &Oacute; Rathaille that the Pretender was in fact about to come to Ireland's aid. By way of contrast, <span class="italic">Tion&oacute;l na bhFear Muimhneach</span> (&#145;The assembly of the men of Munster&#146;) tells of the poet's vision of the nobles of Munster preparing for the Jacobite invasion and the return of &#145;the wanderer without a blemish &hellip; to his rightful place in his full power and pure beauty&#146;. In <span class="italic">Maidin sul smaoin Titan a chosa do luadhaill</span> (&#145;One morning ere yet Titan had thought to stir his feet&#146;) the poet encounters a group of other-worldly women who light three candles &#145;of indescribable light&#146; on a hilltop to guide the return of the Stuart pretender to &#145;rule and defend the triple realm&#146; of Ireland, England, and Scotland forever. <span class="italic">Mac an Cheanna&iacute;</span> (&#145;The redeemer's son&#146;) is perhaps his best-known <i>aisling</i> and it may date from as late as 1722. It is also the only one of his <i>aisling</i> poems in which he adheres quite rigidly to the usual formula and it is written in a more popular metrical form. In this <i>aisling gh&eacute;ar</i> or &#145;bitter vision&#146;, however, there seems to be no hope of the Pretender returning to the aid of &#145;the maiden mild whose name was &Eacute;ire&#146; and, indeed, at the end of the poem the poet himself informs the maiden that her &#145;redeemer&#146; is in fact dead at which she herself is seen to expire. It has been suggested by Owen Dudley Edwards that the Mac an Cheanna&iacute; referred to here was James FitzJames, duke of Berwick, who undermined the Jacobite cause by refusing to join the 1715 rising and by vanquishing Spanish arms during the War of the Spanish Succession. This would undoubtedly explain &Oacute; Rathaille's disillusionment in Mac an Cheanna&iacute; and it also indicates that, as well as having a deep knowledge of Jacobite popular culture, he had a fine awareness of contemporary European politics and the Jacobite cause.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Rathaille wrote one prose work, some time about 1713, a satire on the upstarts who had made good in the wake of the dispossession of the MacCarthys and of &Oacute; Rathaille's own people. This work is entitled <span class="italic">Eachtra Thaidhg Dhuibh U&iacute; Chr&oacute;in&iacute;n</span> (&#145;The adventure of Tadhg Dubh &Oacute; Cr&oacute;in&iacute;n&#146;) and purports to describe a gathering of upstarts in Kerry to discuss the repression of the remaining Gaelic nobility of the area which, in the end, descends into violence and bloodshed. The <span class="italic">Eachtra</span> is heavily indebted to a famous seventeenth-century prose satire entitled <span class="italic">Pairlement Chloinne Tom&aacute;is</span> and it provides interesting insights into &Oacute; Rathaille's view of those who were making good under the new order.<br>
<br>In 1720 Sir Valentine Browne inherited the lands of his father and &Oacute; Rathaille was furious to find that he was not treated with any more favour by Valentine than he was by upstarts such as Tadhg Dubh &Oacute; Cr&oacute;in&iacute;n. He wrote of his feelings towards Valentine in <span class="italic">Vailint&iacute;n Br&uacute;n</span> in which he accused Sir Valentine of having &#145;usurped the rights of the noble MacCarthy&#146;.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Rathaille seems to have ended his days in the Sliabh Luachra area of his youth, and his great valedictory poem is entitled <span class="italic">Cabhair N&iacute; Ghairfead</span> (&#145;I will not call for help&#146;), popularly known as <span class="italic">An File ar Leaba a Bh&aacute;is</span> (&#145;The poet on his deathbed&#146;). Here he portrays himself as close to death and states that he will no longer ask Valentine Browne or anyone else for help but will follow his beloved MacCarthys, who were his people's princes &#145;since before the death of Christ&#146;, to the grave. &Oacute; Rathaille died in 1729 and was buried in Muckross Abbey in Killarney, burial place of the MacCarthys.<br>
