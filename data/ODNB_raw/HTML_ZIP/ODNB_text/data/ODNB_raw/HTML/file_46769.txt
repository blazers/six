<span class="headword">Campbell, Sir  Alexander</span>, first baronet  (1760&#150;1824), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 20 August 1760, the fourth son of John Campbell of Baleed, Perthshire, of a branch of the Breadalbane Campbells, and his wife, Isabella, daughter of John Campbell of Barcaldine. He entered the army by purchasing an ensign's commission in the 1/1st (Royal) regiment on 1 November 1776, became a lieutenant in the same regiment on 25 December 1778, and then became a captain (by purchase) in the newly raised 97th foot on 13 April 1780. He embarked with the 97th as a marine officer on board the Channel Fleet under Vice-Admiral George Darby in September 1780, was at the first relief of Gibraltar in May 1781, and afterwards again served as a marine in Hyde Parker's fleet at the battle of the Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781. In March 1782 the 97th foot returned to Gibraltar, to reinforce the garrison, whence it eventually returned after the end of the &#145;great siege&#146; in July 1783 and was disbanded at Hilsea barracks on 23 September. Campbell was placed on half pay. In 1783 he married Olympia Elizabeth Morshead (<i>d</i>. 24 Dec 1794), eldest daughter of William Morshead of Cartuther, Cornwall, and sister of Sir John Morshead, baronet, of Trenant Park, Cornwall. They had three daughters (Olympia, Charlotte, and Amelia) and two sons, both of whom predeceased him. In 1787 four new regiments were raised specifically for service in India and Campbell was appointed a captain in the 74th (Argyll) highlanders with effect from 25 December 1787, and in 1793 went to India. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the regiment on 4 December 1795, and commanded it with distinction at the storming of Srirangapatnam on 4 May 1799. He held important commands in southern India, finally succeeding Sir Arthur Wellesley (later duke of Wellington) as governor of Srirangapatnam in 1805. He left India at the end of 1807.<br>
<br>On his return to the United Kingdom in 1808 Campbell was initially appointed a brigadier-general and placed on the staff in Ireland; then in January 1809 he went to Portugal as a brigade commander. Slightly wounded by grapeshot in the thigh at Talavera on 28 July 1809, while temporarily commanding the 4th division, he briefly returned home on sick leave and was appointed colonel of a penal unit incongruously called the York light infantry volunteers. Returning to the Peninsula in January 1810, he was promoted major-general on 25 July and transferred to the command of the new 6th division. He commanded the division at Fuentes d'O&ntilde;oro on 5 May 1811, but poor health compelled him to return home in December 1811. So he was fortuitously placed to stand proxy for Wellington at the latter's installation as a knight of the Bath and as such was himself knighted in 1812. On 9 March 1812 he was nominated commander-in-chief of the forces on the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and Bourbon, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, and he served there from January 1813 to August 1816. He was promoted substantive lieutenant-general on 4 June 1814. On 6 May 1815 he was created a baronet, and transferred to the more prestigious colonelcy of the 80th foot on 28 December 1815. On 6 December 1820 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the king's and East India Company's troops in the Madras presidency. He married, secondly, Elizabeth Anne (<i>d</i>. 20 Jan 1870), daughter of the Revd Thomas Pemberton; they had a son who died in infancy and a daughter, Flora Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1824). On 3 July 1821 Campbell obtained a renewed patent to the baronetcy, extending the limitation to his grandson, Alexander Cockburn, and after him to the male issue of his second daughter Isabella, Lady Malcolm. Campbell died on 11 December 1824 at Madras and was buried there. His elder son, Lieutenant John Morshead Campbell, was killed in action at Assaye in 1804, and the younger, Major Allan William Campbell, was fatally wounded at Sorauren, while temporarily attached to the Portuguese army, and died at Pamplona on 9 October 1813. He was succeeded by his grandson Alexander Thomas Cockburn, who in 1825 took the additional surname Campbell (making Cockburn-Campbell) and he and his descendants resided in Australia.<br>
