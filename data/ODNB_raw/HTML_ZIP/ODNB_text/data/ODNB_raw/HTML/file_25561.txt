<span class="headword">Lobb,  Emmanuel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Joseph Simons]</span>  (1594&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Jesuit and playwright</span>, was born at Portsmouth and at the age of eleven was sent to Portugal to learn the language with a view to mercantile life. There he was converted to the Catholic faith by the Jesuit Henry Floyd. After a while he was sent to the college of the English Jesuits at St Omer, and on 13 October 1616 he entered the English College at Rome under the assumed name of Joseph Simons by which he became generally known; his father was noted as dead but his mother was still alive. Having received minor orders in 1617 he left Rome for the Spanish Netherlands on 14 September 1619, was received into the Society of Jesus at Li&egrave;ge, and was professed of the four vows on 25 January 1633. After professing rhetoric and <i>belles-lettres</i> in the English College at St Omer for five years he became professor of theology, philosophy, and sacred scripture in the English theologate of the Society of Jesus at Li&egrave;ge. Between 1642 and 1644 he was involved in the foundation of the convent of the English canonesses at Li&egrave;ge, subsequently giving them financial help in 1668 and 1669. In 1647 he was appointed rector of the English College at Rome, and in 1650 rector of the theologate at Li&egrave;ge. He was also instructor of the tertian fathers at Ghent. Being subsequently sent to the English mission he was at one period rector of the college of St Ignatius. In 1667 he became the English provincial. When living in London in 1669 he was consulted by the duke of York, whom he afterwards reconciled to the Roman Catholic church. He died in London on 24 July 1671.<br>
<br>Simons was author of the following tragedies, all of which are in five acts and in verse. They were all first performed at the English College, St Omer, as follows: <span class="italic">Vitus</span> (13 May 1623), <span class="italic">Mercia</span> (7 February 1624), <span class="italic">Theoctistus</span> (8 August 1624), <span class="italic">Leo Armenus</span> (between 1624 and 1629), <span class="italic">Zeno</span> (7 August 1631). <span class="italic">Zeno</span> and <span class="italic">Mercia</span> were first printed at Rome in 1648 and <span class="italic">Theoctistus</span> at Li&egrave;ge in 1653; Simons's collected plays were published later as <span class="italic">Tragoediae quinque</span> (first edition Li&egrave;ge, 1656; reprinted 1657, 1680, and 1697). The tragedies were frequently acted on the continent in Simons's lifetime, and are perhaps the most distinguished contribution made by a seventeenth-century English author to the genre of Jesuit drama. Also speculatively attributable to him are <span class="italic">S. Damianus</span>, acted at St Omer on 13 February 1626 and preserved together with <span class="italic">Leo Armenus</span> and <span class="italic">Zeno</span> in two manuscripts, and a lost play on King Robert of Sicily, performed at St Omer on 19 June 1623. <span class="italic">An Answer to Doctor Pierce's Sermon</span> (1663) is attributed to Simons by a contemporary, Thomas Blount, and in the <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue</span>, though this work has sometimes been assigned to John Sergeant. A manuscript treatise on penitence, dated 1642 (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D. 1355), may also be Simons's.<br>
