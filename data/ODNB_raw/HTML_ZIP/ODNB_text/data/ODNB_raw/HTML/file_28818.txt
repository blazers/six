<span class="headword">Waterton,  Charles</span>  (1782&#150;1865), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born on 3 June 1782, at the family seat of Walton Hall, Sandal Magna, near Wakefield, the eldest son of the six children of Thomas Waterton (<i>d</i>. 1805), and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1819), a daughter of Edward Bedingfeld and his wife, Mary. Waterton's father, who had inherited Walton Hall in 1767, was a direct descendant of Sir Thomas More, chancellor to Henry VIII. The family had a long history in northern England: it was mentioned in Shakespeare (<span class="italic">Richard II</span>, II.1), distinguished at Agincourt, and a staunch royalist supporter at Marston Moor.<br>
<br>Waterton was educated as a Roman Catholic, and in 1792 was sent to a small preparatory school at Tudhoe, near Durham. Four years later he went to Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, where it was said he became a fanatical rat-catcher. In 1798 he made a promise (on the advice of his master, Father Clifford) never to drink wine or spirits&#151;a promise he kept for the rest of his life. He remained at Stonyhurst until 1801 and spent the following year at home, hunting with Lord Darlington.<br>
<br>In November 1802 Waterton sailed for Spain with his younger brother Christopher on the brig <i>Industry</i>. They visited Cadiz, before travelling to Malaga to stay with two maternal uncles, who were naturalized Spaniards. A year after Waterton's arrival, there was an outbreak of &#145;black vomit&#146; (plague) in Malaga. He fell seriously ill and one of his uncles died. Nevertheless, both the Waterton brothers managed to escape from the quarantined city and returned to England in 1803. Waterton then enjoyed a season's hunting in Yorkshire, but his health was still not good, and he decided to sample the warmer climes of the family estates at Demerara.<h2>
<a name="TravelsinSouthAmerica"></a>Travels in South America</h2>On 29 November 1804 Waterton sailed from Portsmouth on board the <i>Fame</i>, and after a voyage of six weeks landed at Stabroek (later Georgetown). He managed four large plantations at Demerara, owned by his uncle Christopher Waterton, along with several hundred enslaved people attached to the estates. While in Demerara he took in the opportunity to pursue his natural history studies. On the death of his father in 1805, he inherited Walton Hall, and returned home. About 1806 or 1807 he returned to Demerara where he continued to manage the family estates, and travel extensively. In 1807 he received a commission as lieutenant in the 2nd regiment of the Demerara militia, a position which provided him with the opportunity to explore the Orinoco. On 2 August 1808 he departed from Demerara in the <i>Levina</i>, on behalf of the British government, to convey dispatches from Admiral Collingwood to the Spanish captain-general of the Orinoco, Don Felipe de Ynciarte. Furthermore, Waterton was granted permission to enter Dutch Guiana by Governor Carmichael.<br>
<br>Waterton relinquished responsibility for the family plantations in 1812 and in that April, at the beginning of the wet season, set out on an expedition into the Demerara forests. His primary aim for this expedition was to acquire samples of curare poison (or &#145;wourali&#146;), thought at the time to be a possible remedy for rabies. He was also keen to visit Lake Parima, in search of the elusive golden city of El Dorado of the Amerindians. During the expedition he paddled up the Demerara River to the rock of Seba. Several weeks later, on reaching a settlement of Macusi Indians, he was successful in obtaining samples of curare. (His research into the anaesthetic properties of the drug brought curare to the attention of a wide audience and contributed to its later widespread use.) He journeyed on to the Essequibo and Burro Burro rivers, the savannahs on the Brazil frontier, and from the Pirara River he travelled by canoe on to the fort of S&atilde;o Joachim. However, four months after beginning his expedition, he fell ill and was forced to quit his journey. In 1813, probably sick with malaria, he sailed home to England on the <i>Fame</i>, docking at Liverpool in the spring of that year. Owing to his lingering illness, he was forced to decline an exploration of Madagascar, for which venture he had been personally recommended by Governor Carmichael to Lord Bathurst. He spent the next three years at Walton Hall, which stood on an island in a lake of about 30 acres, surrounded by a well-wooded park. In the autumn of 1814 Waterton was badly injured while loading a gun; he attended to the wound himself, and then bled himself using his lancet. He had been introduced to the practice of bloodletting by Dr John Marshall, in Guiana, and Waterton was a firm advocate of its beneficial use.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1816 Waterton sailed from Liverpool on board the <i>Indian</i> to embark on his second &#145;wandering&#146; in South America. He landed in April at Pernambuco (Recife), Brazil, where he collected a number of birds, before proceeding on a Portuguese brig to Cayenne, French Guiana, using a hen-coop on deck as his bed. He then sailed on a Yankee brig to Paramaribo, Surinam, New Amsterdam, and Georgetown. He spent six months in the forest collecting more than 200 specimens, and searching for the &#145;feathered tribe&#146;. In 1817 he returned home, on board the <i>Dee</i>, with his numerous specimens. Waterton, a skilled taxidermist, had developed an alternative method for preserving specimens: skins were soaked in a solution of alcohol and bichloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate) for several hours, dried, and then modelled into shape from the interior&#151;rendering internal stuffing unnecessary. A scarlet ibis was believed to be the earliest specimen preserved by this technique in 1810. His preserved specimens were often arranged on the staircase at Walton Hall. In later years John Edmonston, a freed slave Waterton had brought back from Guiana, taught Charles Darwin how to stuff birds, having been taught himself by Waterton.<br>
<br>In October 1817 Waterton visited Italy where he passed the winter of 1817&#150;18. In Rome, accompanied by Captain Edwin Jones, his friend from Tudhoe School, he displayed his increasing eccentricity: placing a glove on top of the lightning conductor above the cross of St Peter's and standing on one leg on the head of the guardian angel which surmounted the castle of St Angelo. In 1818 he made another visit to Rome, this time accompanied by his old Stonyhurst friends, seeking an audience with a Vatican official. He returned to England on 19 February 1818.<br>
<br>In February 1820 Waterton set sail from the Clyde in the <i>Glenbervie</i> for his third &#145;wandering&#146; in South America. He arrived back in Georgetown, where yellow fever had become epidemic, and by June that year he was himself ill with fever. He prepared his own cure, which consisted of cinchona bark, laudanum, calomel, and jalap, in addition to his routine bloodletting. During this trip to Demerara he ventured into the interior by way of the Essequibo River. He remained in the forest for eleven months, and collected 230 birds, 2 land tortoises, 5 armadillos, 2 large snakes, a sloth (his favourite subject), a giant anteater, and a cayman. On his return to Liverpool in the <i>Dee</i>, in 1821, he was met by excisemen who withheld his collection for several weeks until the duty was assessed.<br>
<br>After his return Waterton decided to surround the park at Walton Hall with a 9 foot wall which was completed in the summer of 1826. Within the enclosed park he banned the use of guns, and the area was transformed into what was probably the country's first nature reserve and bird sanctuary. Alexander Wilson's <span class="italic">Ornithology of the United States</span> inspired Waterton to visit America, and in the early summer of 1824, he sailed on board the <i>John Wells</i> to New York, and commenced his fourth &#145;wandering&#146;. He travelled in Canada and the United States, where he was introduced to the ornithologist George Ord (1781&#150;1866), with whom he regularly corresponded. In the autumn of 1824 Waterton sailed from New York to the West Indies, and passed on to Demerara. Here he proceeded to the forests of the interior, journeyed some 200 miles up-river, and studied jacamars, red grosbeaks, sunbirds, tinamous, and humming-birds, as well as &#145;vampires&#146;, sloths, and monkeys. In January 1825 he completed his final tour of Guiana, and sailed back to Southampton.<br>
<br>In August 1825 Waterton published his account of the four journeys in a quarto volume, <span class="italic">Wanderings in South America, the north-west of the United States, and the Antilles in the years 1812, 1816, 1820, and 1824</span>. The work was reprinted several times, and edited with illustrations and some alterations, by J. G. Wood, in 1879. Details of the &#145;Waterton method&#146; for preserving natural history specimens were also appended to his travel observations&#151;the frontispiece of his book represented a human face based on that of a red monkey, which had been modelled using his method.<br>
<br>In the chapel of the canonesses of St Augustine (an English convent), on the rue des Carmes, Bruges, at 5.30 a.m. on 18 May 1829, Waterton married Anne Mary (1812&#150;1830), second of six children of Charles Edmonstone (<i>d</i>. 1827) of Cardross Park, Dumbarton, and his wife, Helen, daughter of William Reid, a timber cutter, and his wife, &#145;Princess Minda&#146;, an Arawak Indian. Waterton had often stayed at Charles Edmonstone's home, Warrows Place, Mibiri Creek, during his visits to Demerara. It was believed that Waterton had vowed, as he attended Anne Mary's baptism some seventeen years earlier, that he would some day marry the child. However, the marriage was short: Anne Mary died on 27 April 1830, the result of puerperal sepsis following the birth of their only child, Edmund. She was buried three days later, in the Waterton family vault at Sandal Magna church (St Helen's). Waterton placed a picture of St Catharine of Alexandria, which resembled his wife, over a mantelpiece at Walton Hall, and to the end of his life often fixed his eyes on it as he sat by the fire. His wife's sisters, Eliza Edmonstone (1807&#150;1870) and Helen Edmonstone (1813&#150;1879), took over the running of the house for him until he died. Eliza and Helen died at Ostend and Bruges, respectively; both were unmarried.<h2>
<a name="LatertravelsinEurope"></a>Later travels in Europe</h2>In 1830 Waterton travelled on the continent. During these travels he bought a collection of paintings from a Herr Berwind at W&uuml;rzburg, and also revisited Bruges on his way home. In the summer of 1833 he paid another visit to Belgium, accompanied by his sisters-in-law, son, and two servants. In 1838 he published the first series of his <span class="italic">Essays in Natural History</span>, which were followed in 1844 by a second series, and in 1857 by a third series. Several of the essays first appeared in John Claudius Loudon's <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> and Waterton gave the proceeds from his second series to Mrs Loudon following her husband's sudden death in 1843. Each series of essays was preceded by a portion of autobiography, and while a few essays focused on tropical subjects, the majority examined English birds and wild animals. His <span class="italic">Essays</span>, including thirty-six of his letters, and a biography written by his close friend Sir Norman Moore (1847&#150;1922) were published in 1870.<br>
<br>Waterton again travelled on the continent in 1840. However, on this occasion he was joined at Cologne by his friend Alexander Fletcher (1808&#150;1888), with whom he journeyed to Rome. Waterton spent the winter of 1840&#150;41 in Rome, where he attended mass at four o'clock every morning in the church of the Ges&ugrave;, made many ornithological observations, and collected specimens of local birds. He started back to England on 10 June 1841, but was shipwrecked in the <i>Pollux</i> near Elba on the night of 17 June 1841, and returned to Italy. He departed for England from Rome for a second time, on 20 July 1841, visiting many places <i>en route</i>, including Aix-la-Chapelle. In later years he often visited Aix-la-Chapelle in addition to trips to Scarborough in the autumn and Stonyhurst College at Christmas.<br>
<br>In 1844 Waterton made another journey across continental Europe, in particular to Austria and Italy. The following year he was awarded the knighthood of the supreme order of Christ from Dom Miguel, exiled king of Portugal. He returned home in June 1845, and in November that year accompanied his sisters-in-law to Madeira, where he stayed until January the next year. During this period he made numerous improvements at Walton Hall, including a new garden and a pigeon-cot, and in 1855 he improved the drainage of the lake.<h2>
<a name="Penanceanddeath"></a>Penance and death</h2>Waterton lived on good terms with his neighbours, and at Walton Hall he exercised a continuous and genial hospitality. As penance, following the death of his wife, he slept on the bare floor of a small room at the top of the house, using a wooden block as a pillow, and a military cloak or blanket for a covering. He rose at three, lit his fire, and lay down for half an hour while it burned up. He then dressed, spending from four to five in the morning in his chapel. He then read a chapter on the life of St Francis Xavier, and one on Don Quixote, both in Spanish, and wrote letters or stuffed birds until eight, when he breakfasted. He dined at half-past one and had tea at six and spent a great part of the day in his park. He kept his hair very short, indoors he wore an old-fashioned swallow-tailed coat, refusing to adopt the formal fashion of his day, and also wore shoes several sizes too large. Until very late in life he continued to climb trees, and was said to impress friends by scratching the back of his head with his big toe.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1865 Waterton tripped and fell; the accident resulted in considerable internal injuries, from which he died at Walton Hall two days later. He was buried on 3 June 1865 (his birthday), between two old oaks, on the lake-shore in his park, under a stone cross which he had erected in the previous year, and which bore the epitaph &#145;Orate pro anima: Caroli Waterton: cujus fessa juxta hanc crucem sepeliuntur ossa&#146; (&#145;Pray for the soul of Charles Waterton, whose wearied bones lie beneath this cross&#146;). A permanent display was dedicated to Waterton at the Wakefield Museum.<br>
<br>Waterton's only child, <a name="cosubject_28818"></a><span class="headword">Edmund Waterton</span>  (1830&#150;1887), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 7 April 1830, at Walton Hall. In September 1841 he was sent to be educated, like his father, at Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1850. Throughout his life he was a devout Roman Catholic. He married twice. His first wife, whom he married on 20 August 1862, while his father and aunts, Eliza and Helen, were abroad at Aix-la-Chapelle, was Josephine Margaret Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1879), second daughter of Sir John Ennis, of Ballinahown Court, co. Westmeath. The couple had two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Having run up large debts, Edmund Waterton sold Walton Hall (which later became Waterton Park Hotel) in 1876 (although his father's natural history collection was preserved at Alston Hall, near Preston). In 1879 he purchased Deeping Waterton Hall, Market Deeping, Lincolnshire, which later became the Old Manor House, and all except the chapel became the property of the Xaverian brothers. On 15 November 1881 he married his second wife, Ellen, only child of John Mercer of Alston Hall; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Edmund Waterton wrote several essays on the devotion to the Blessed Virgin in England, formed a collection of rings, many of which went to the British Museum at South Kensington, and collected editions, printed and manuscript, of the <span class="italic">De imitatione Christi</span>. He also published a brief description of some of his rings. When abroad he would use the obsolete title of twenty-seventh lord of Walton on his visiting cards.<br>
<br>In 1858, like his father before him, Waterton was admitted as knight of the supreme order of Christ. He was also a knight of Malta, papal privy chamberlain, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He died after a long illness, on 22 July 1887, and was buried in the Waterton chapel, in Deeping Waterton, with his first wife. He was survived by his second wife, who died on 10 January 1909; she was buried in the Mercer family vault at Alston Lane.<br>
