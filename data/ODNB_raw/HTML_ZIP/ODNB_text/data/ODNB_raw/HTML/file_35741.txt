<span class="headword">Richey,  James Ernest</span>  (1886&#150;1968), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 24 April 1886 at Ballymully, co. Tyrone, the son of the Revd John Richey, priest in the Church of Ireland and rector of Desertcreat, and his wife, Susana Best. Educated at St Columba's College, Rathfarnham, and at Trinity College, Dublin, he graduated BA in natural sciences in 1908 (with the award of a senior moderatorship and a gold medal) and BAI (bachelor of engineering) in 1909. His published work gained him the degree of ScD of Trinity in 1934.<br>
<br>After a period as demonstrator at Oxford (1910&#150;11) under W. J. Sollas, Richey joined the geological survey in 1911 and was assigned as a geologist to the Scotland office in Edinburgh. Richey went into the field under C. T. Clough (and later Edward Battersby Bailey) in Mull. It fell to Richey to complete the mapping of a broad dyke crossing Loch B&agrave;; his meticulous work showed its annular, outward-dipping shape and provided the key to the principal structural element in the complex, a ring-fracture which had permitted the subsidence of a plug of rock more than 1 kilometre wide into the magma chamber below. It now began to emerge that a series of such ring-subsidences had taken place during the eruptive episode, and that a considerable variety of different rock-types had been emplaced in the fractures. The ring-dyke concept thus enabled successive foci to be defined, and the stages in the evolution of the magmas to be determined. Bailey had previously recognized what he called cauldron subsidence in the much older intrusive complex at Glencoe on the mainland. Now the way was open for the elucidation of the history of the Tertiary volcanoes, the interiors of which had been exposed by erosion over the past 55 million years. A large share of this work fell to Richey, and he became the leading figure in a subject that influenced work on volcanoes, ancient and modern, worldwide.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Richey was commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1914, serving with the guards division in France, reaching the rank of captain, and gaining the MC. After the war, he began an investigation of the Ardnamurchan peninsula, where the ring form of the intrusions is beautifully reflected in the topography, and by 1924 he had completed an extremely detailed 6 inch survey. In the same year Richey married Henrietta Lily McNally from his own home county, and with his charm and Irish wit, sometimes mordant, they made an ideal couple. They later had three daughters.<br>
<br>The publication of Richey's Ardnamurchan map and descriptive memoir in 1930 was a landmark in the subject. However by then, although not entirely part of his official duties, he had begun to look at other volcanic centres on an axis which ran through Skye, Mull, and Arran, in order to reinterpret Harker's mapping in Skye and that of the geological survey of Ireland in Slieve Gullion and the Mourne Mountains. In an outstanding presidential address to the Geological Society of Glasgow in 1932 he was able to give a new conspectus of Tertiary vulcanicity in the British Isles, and he was later able to show that quiet upwelling of magnesian magmas alternated with violent periods of explosion when the magma became silica-rich.<br>
<br>Richey's geological interests were very wide. From 1925, when he became district geologist, he was actively engaged in the metamorphic areas of Morar, Moidart, and Morvern, and the granitic complex of Strontian. His collaborators in this study included W. Q. Kennedy, J. B. Simpson, and A. G. MacGregor. He contributed substantially to geological knowledge of Renfrewshire and Ayrshire, and later to the eastern midland valley of coalfield surveys in Scotland. After his retirement from the geological survey at the age of sixty, he set up as a consulting geologist and also gave lectures at Queen's College, Dundee. He wrote a number of papers, and also penned the foreword to the first issue of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology</span> (1967).<br>
<br>Richey's work achieved wide recognition. He received the Lyell medal of the Geological Society of London in 1933 and was elected FRS in 1938. The Geological Society of Edinburgh gave him their Clough medal in 1964, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of which he was a fellow (1927), general secretary (1946&#150;56), and a vice-president (1956&#150;9), awarded him its Neill prize in 1965. He became an honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1967, and was an honorary fellow of the Geological Society of America (1948). The Society of Engineers awarded him its first Baker medal in 1954. His influential work on ancient volcanoes led to his election to the vice-presidency (1936&#150;48) of the International Association of Volcanologists, a constituent body of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. From 1950 to 1959 he was chairman of the Royal Society's committee on vulcanology. His presidencies included the geological societies of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and section C of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.<br>
<br>Richey was visited at his homes in Edinburgh and Monifieth, Angus, by geologists from all over the world. He was generous with his time and liked to encourage younger men to criticize and re-examine his work. Among his leisure interests, gardening was one of the chief. He had the charming custom of attaching names of friends he wished to remember to his rhododendron bushes. Richey died at Coleshill, Warwickshire, on 19 June 1968, survived by his wife.<br>
