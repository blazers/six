<span class="headword">Sherland,  Christopher</span>  (1594&#150;1632), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born in Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire, and baptized on 28 April 1594, the first son of Thomas Sherland esquire of Milden, Suffolk, and his wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30213/', "Sir Christopher Yelverton")</script> of Easton Maudit. He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, on 8 May 1607 aged thirteen and he graduated BA on 31 January 1610. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 1 November 1604, was called to the bar on 26 June 1617, and he became a bencher in 1627. At an unknown date he married Jane, daughter of Edward Oglethorpe of Smithfield, London.<br>
<br>According to Sherland's contemporary biographer, Richard Sibbes, preacher at Gray's Inn, the dominant influence on Sherland's early years was his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30214/', "Sir Henry Yelverton")</script>, who persuaded him to set aside his early inclination to become a divine and to pursue his studies in the law. It was also on his uncle's recommendation that Sherland was appointed recorder of Northampton on 23 June 1623. During the late 1620s he lived in the town, representing the borough in the parliaments of 1624, 1625, 1626, and 1628&#150;9, and acting as legal adviser to the corporation and to local gentry families, such as the Drydens and the Knightleys. He also formed close links with the network of local puritan ministers, including Thomas Ball of Northampton, Robert Bolton of Weekley, John Dod of Fawsley, and Andrew Perne of Wilby, whom he described in his will as &#145;my reverend and pious friends&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB, 11/10, Audley, 1632). He was among those who defaulted over payment of the forced loan at Northampton in 1627.<br>
<br>At a national level Sherland was closely involved with the leading puritan opponents of crown policies. He was one of the four lawyers among the feoffees for impropriations established in 1625, and by his will he left &pound;400 to the feoffees &#145;for furtherance of the preaching of the gospel&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB, 11/10, Audley, 1632). He was also a founding member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95346', "Providence Island Company")</script>, set up in September 1630, and, in the same month, he joined William Fiennes, first Viscount Saye and Sele, Sir Nathaniel Rich, John Pym, and John Crewe as members of a trust established by Richard Knightley to support John Dod. He made &#145;my good friend&#146; John Hampden executor of his will.<br>
<br>In the absence of correspondence, the clearest impression of Sherland's attitudes and concerns is provided by his contributions in parliament, where he was a prominent speaker and committee man. His main priority was the defence of Calvinist orthodoxy. Sibbes described him as someone well versed in &#145;controverted points of divinity&#146; and, with the exception of John Pym, no MP in the late 1620s was more vigorous in his efforts to demonstrate the dangers presented by Arminianism. His first significant speech was in August 1625 when he opposed a grant of subsidies and suggested that proper enforcement of the recusancy laws would provide the king with a more than adequate revenue. In 1626 he reported to the Commons on the outcome of the York House conference, at which George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, had declared his support for Arminianism, and when he delivered one of the Commons charges against Buckingham in the Lords he added his own gloss that he was &#145;the principal patron of a semi-pelagian, semi-popish faction, dangerous to church and state, lately set on foot among us&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1628, like other leading lawyers, Sherland was much involved in the debates leading to the petition of right, but again his main concern was religion. In the debate on the remonstrance against Buckingham in June he argued that the Arminians &#145;run in string with the papists and flatter greatness to oppress the subject&#146;, thereby making what has been described as a new and crucial intellectual link between the alteration of religion and the alteration of government. In 1629 he was again at the forefront of discussions on Arminianism, proposing the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> of 1562 as a basic standard of religious orthodoxy and denouncing the evil influence of Arminian advisers close to the king. Sherland died in February 1632. He had no surviving children. He was regarded by Sir John Eliot as one of the ablest and most articulate critics of Charles I's government.<br>
