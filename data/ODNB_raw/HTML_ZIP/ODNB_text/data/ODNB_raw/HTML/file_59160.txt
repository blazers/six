<span class="headword">Bacon,  Thomas</span>  (1700?&#150;1768), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and musician</span>, was probably born either in the Isle of Man or Cumberland. He had at least one brother. He is known to have been in charge of a coal depot in Dublin in 1737, the year in which he published <span class="italic">A Compleat System of the Revenue of Ireland</span>. In the same year he married a widow who kept a Dublin coffee house in Essex Street; this became known as Bacon's Coffee House.<br>
<br>In January 1742 Bacon established a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Dublin Mercury</span>, at the coffee house premises. Samuel Richardson's novel <span class="italic">Pamela</span> was first advertised in Ireland in this newspaper, and on 10 April 1742 it announced the first public performance of Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>; the performance was reviewed in a later issue. In September 1742 Bacon received authorization to print the <span class="italic">Dublin Gazette</span>, the official newspaper of Ireland, but in July 1743 he ceased its publication without giving prior notice.<br>
<br>Soon after abandoning publishing Bacon studied for holy orders with Thomas Wilson, the bishop of Sodor and Man, his aim being to emigrate to Maryland, where his brother Anthony had prospered as a merchant. He was ordained deacon by Wilson on 23 September 1744 and as priest on 10 March 1745. Anthony Bacon returned to England in 1748, and traded successfully in London.<br>
<br>Accompanied by his wife and son John (Jacky), Thomas Bacon left the Isle of Man in June 1745 and arrived in Maryland in August or September. He took up residence in Talbot county, located on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, and there served as curate of St Peter's parish until his appointment as rector in March 1746. It was there that he began to make a name for himself, not only as a clergyman, but also as a musician and composer. Bacon was an excellent violinist and cellist, and enjoyed visiting the homes of friends for dinner, discussion, and music. He often crossed Chesapeake Bay to visit Annapolis, the capital of Maryland, and the site of much social activity. He became an honorary member and chief musician of the Tuesday Club, a very exclusive group of men. Bacon composed several &#145;birthday odes&#146; and occasional music for the club, and was dubbed &#145;Signior (<i>sic</i>) Lardini&#146;, a pun on his surname. He remained chief musician until 1754.<br>
<br>As a clergyman Bacon especially espoused social reform and was an advocate of education for poor children and slaves. At St Peter's parish he preached several sermons between 1749 and 1753 which were published and sold in aid of establishing a charity school. He even travelled to Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia, to solicit funds by preaching and performing. In May 1755 the building was completed, but the school never achieved success.<br>
<br>The mid-1750s proved to be a turning point for Bacon. His wife died in 1755; he was charged with rape later that year (eventually he was acquitted); and his son was killed in the local wars against the French and Indians. In 1757 he married Elizabeth Bozman (<i>d</i>. 21 July 1768), a parishioner from a nearby village. He had been the officiating priest at her marriage, only two years before, to the Revd Thomas Belchier, who was found to be a bigamist. However, Bacon married Elizabeth without previously publishing the banns of marriage and obtaining a marriage licence. He was indicted and fined, but the indictment was later dropped.<br>
<br>Along with his wife and three daughters Bacon left Talbot county in 1758 for All Saints' parish, Frederick county, where he was asked to serve as curate; he did not become rector there until 1762. All Saints' was the most desirable living in Maryland, worth almost &pound;1000 a year, and while there Bacon sought permission from the general assembly of the provincial government to compile and publish a new edition and index of colonial laws. However, though his <span class="italic">Laws of Maryland</span> was completed in 1762, it was not printed until 1765. He made an unsuccessful attempt to commit the parish vestry to contributing to the establishment of a charity school in Frederick. By 1767 Bacon's health had declined badly; he died at Frederick, deeply in debt, on 26 May 1768. On that day John Cary wrote to Bacon's dear friend Walter Dulany that &#145;Our worthy, our good, and sincere friend, the Revd Mr. Bacon is now no more; he departed this life about ten minutes ago, sincerely lamented by all honest men here&#146;  (Dulany MS I, fol. 20).<br>
