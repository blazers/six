<span class="headword">Thomas,  Francis Inigo</span>  (1865&#150;1950), <span class="occ">architect and garden designer</span>, was born at Warmsworth, near Doncaster, Yorkshire, on 25 December 1865, the fifth son of Charles Edward Thomas (1823&#150;1901), rector of Warmsworth, and his wife, Georgiana Mary (1828&#150;1921), daughter of Colonel Henry Hely-Hutchinson of Weston Hall, Northamptonshire. For several generations the gentrified Thomases had been settled at Ratton Park, Willingdon, Sussex, and through marriages were related to a number of aristocratic families, a circumstance that was to be useful to F. Inigo Thomas, as he became known, at the outset of his career.<br>
<br>Thomas was educated at Haileybury College, Hertford, and in 1884 went to Pembroke College, Oxford. Later that same decade he joined the London office of the Gothic revival architects G. F. Bodley and Thomas Garner. During this apprenticeship he lived with his elderly uncle William Brodrick Thomas (1811&#150;1898), a sometime successful designer of landscape gardens who had been obliged to accommodate himself to the developing taste&#151;driven by an army of ambitious professional plantsmen and the new horticultural magazines&#151;for ahistorical gardens replete with imported specimen plants and other foreign novelties. It was this unwelcome drift that Thomas and other young architects confronted. Identifying Tudor and seventeenth-century houses and gardens as the zenith of English design, and inspired by the aims and values of William Morris and the arts and crafts movement, they sought to recover the native character and style of the smaller country house and its surroundings.<br>
<br>In 1889 Thomas made the first of a series of study tours on the continent, compiling a portfolio of his own drawings, watercolours, and etchings of old houses and gardens in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. He also travelled in Britain to the same end, and in 1892 he and his fellow architect Reginald Blomfield published <span class="italic">The Formal Garden in England</span>, an illustrated historical survey that promoted designs featuring masonry gazebos and pavilions, balustrading, dipping wells, rectilinear and circular pools, lead and stone statues, and geometrically clipped yews. Most of its pen-and-ink drawings were by Thomas. The book went into a third edition in 1901, and many years later Blomfield remembered that he largely owed to it &#145;the growth of his practice in early days&#146;  (Fellows, 46). It also helped Thomas's career. Alfred Cart de Lafontaine (<i>d</i>. 1944) had already commissioned Thomas in 1891 to construct vast Elizabethan-style gardens for Athelhampton Hall, Dorset, for which Thomas borrowed from those at Montacute House, Somerset, but in 1892 he was asked to supply an equally ambitious scheme for Barrow Court, Barrow Gurney, Somerset, by Henry Martin Gibbs (<i>d</i>. 1928), who had made his fortune in Peruvian guano. Both sixteenth-century houses were run down and lacked gardens, and both were cheap recent purchases due to a glut in the estate market. Five years on, Lindsay Lindsay-Hogg (1853&#150;1923), later baronet (1905) and Conservative MP (1900&#150;06), chose Thomas to extend Rotherfield Hall near Crowborough, Sussex, another decayed sixteenth-century house recently purchased, and to add terraced gardens, pavilions, and a <i>nymphaeum</i>&#151;a grotto with pool and attendant sculptured nymph.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Thomas was also involved with the Art-Workers' Guild, C. R. Ashbee's School of Handicraft, the Royal Society of Painters and Etchers, and the Society of Arts. He gave illustrated lectures on architectural gardens for the Society of Arts (published in the <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span>, February 1896) and wrote a series of articles &#145;Of garden making&#146; for <span class="italic">Country Life</span> (February&#150;April 1900). He exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts in London (1894), at the Architectural Exhibition held at the Carnegie Art Gallery, Pittsburgh (1900), and elsewhere. At the end of the decade he served in South Africa as a government official during the South African War, and was for a time incarcerated there. Following his return to England commissions were infrequent and insubstantial (a terraced riverside garden for Drakelow Hall near Burton upon Trent in 1902; extensions to Ffynone, a John Nash villa near Manordeifi, Pembrokeshire, in 1904). But in 1910 he was contracted to design gardens for Chantmarle, another Dorset manor house, for Frank Ewart Savill (1869&#150;1916). Chantmarle was Thomas's last substantial layout, and its canal, pools, and balustrading owe much to the influence of the Renaissance and baroque gardens he had explored years before in Italy. (In 1893 he had taken measured surveys and photographs of Italian gardens in the Campagna and elsewhere in the hope of interesting a publisher back in Britain, but none was found and the project was abandoned.)<br>
<br>In 1912 Thomas published his slim <span class="italic">Keystones of Building</span>, a dry, self-deprecating account aimed at providing the layman with &#145;a description of such situations as arise in the progress of building &hellip; in terms that he can understand&#146;  (p. v). Two years later the outbreak of hostilities forced Thomas to close his London office at 44 Piccadilly and work from home at 2 Mulberry Walk, Chelsea, where he made his last-known garden designs the following year for Captain Somerset Arthur Sherston and his wife, Dorothy (only daughter of General Sir William Parke), of Otley Hall, Suffolk. Sherston's death in action in May 1915 curtailed further work there. That same year Thomas was sent to Russia, and in 1916 to Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and Spain in connection with his occasional employment as a liaison officer between government departments and the Federation of British Industries. He continued in this role until his retirement in 1928. A lecture, &#145;Gardens&#146;, that he gave to students in the month before the general strike of May 1926, afterwards published, contains both undiminished enthusiasm for Italianate classicism in design and plangent nostalgia for a world that had passed: &#145;Surplus funds, a cultivated aristocracy, security of tenure and electric power &hellip; are all that is wanted for old England to blossom out again with garden schemes equal to any she has known in the past&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the RIBA</span>, June 1926, 439). In 1930 a valedictory exhibition entitled &#145;The Spell of England&#146; of fifty-one of his paintings was shown in London and Doncaster.<br>
<br>Thomas never married. He died at his home, 2 Mulberry Walk, Chelsea, London, on 27 March 1950, and at his request he was cremated, his ashes joining those of his brother George and sister Frederica in their grave in Putney Vale cemetery. He left the bulk of his real and personal estate to his nephew and sole executor, Major Reginald Brodrick Freeman-Thomas, a land agent, of Hankerton Priory near Malmesbury, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Thomas was a leading figure in the brief revival of architectural gardens that was effectively brought to an end by the First World War. His work was photographed for articles in <span class="italic">Country Life</span> and other periodicals, and it was known in Germany and Austria via Hermann Muthesius's influential three-volume <span class="italic">Das englische Haus</span> (1904&#150;5). Thomas's major gardens&#151;Athelhampton, Barrow Court, Rotherfield, and Chantmarle&#151;survive intact. A portrait in chalks of 1889 of his cousin, the talented composer Arthur Goring Thomas (1850&#150;1892), in the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Tirah campaign obelisk of 1900 in Bonn Square, Oxford, a memorial to the Oxfordshire light infantry's losses on the north-west frontier in 1897&#150;8, are accessible examples of his other undertakings in art and design.<br>
