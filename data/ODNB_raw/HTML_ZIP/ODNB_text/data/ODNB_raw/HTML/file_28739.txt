<span class="headword">Warenne,  William (IV)  de</span>, fifth earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [Earl Warenne]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1240), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the only son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28732/', "Hamelin de Warenne, earl of Surrey (d. 1202)")</script>, an illegitimate son of Geoffrey, count of Anjou, and hence half-brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script>. William's mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28733/', "Isabel de Warenne (d. 1203)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28738/', "William (III) de Warenne (d. 1148)")</script>, inherited a claim to the earldom of Surrey together with sixty knights' fees in England, the honour of Lewes in Sussex, the castles of Reigate in Surrey, Castle Acre in Norfolk, Conisbrough and Sandal near Wakefield in Yorkshire, and extensive estates in Normandy at Mortemer and Bellencombre close to Varenne, the original Warenne stronghold.<br>
<br>Warenne was probably raised in Normandy. He witnessed a charter of Richard I issued at Rouen in September 1197, and for several years before 1202 witnessed and confirmed charters of his father, Earl Hamelin. Hamelin died on 7 May 1202, and on 12 May, in Normandy, Warenne was allowed to do homage for his father's estates. Over the next eighteen months he played a leading part in the defence of Normandy against the French. With the collapse of Plantagenet power in 1204 he sought permission to do homage to the French king, Philip Augustus, for his Norman lands, while promising King John that his heart would remain loyal to the king of England. John refused this offer, and instead, in April 1205, Warenne was awarded the major estates of Stamford and Grantham in Lincolnshire as compensation for his Norman lands which were seized by the French. He none the less maintained his contacts with Normandy via his sisters, Isabel, married to Gilbert, lord of l'Aigle, and Matilda, married first to Henri, count of Eu, and later to Henry de Stuteville or Etoutteville, lord of Valmont. When Gilbert de l'Aigle defected to the French after 1204, Earl William fined &pound;2000 with the crown to have possession of Gilbert's English estates on behalf of his sister, Gilbert's wife. The fine was paid in full between 1207 and 1212, and eventually, after 1217, Gilbert was able to recover his lands in England. Likewise in 1217 Warenne acquired custody of lands in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and elsewhere, seized at the death of Leonia, mother of Henry de Stuteville, Warenne's brother-in-law. No doubt in the hope of regaining his French estates, in 1206 he served on the king's expedition to Poitou. In the following year he was engaged in peace negotiations with Scotland. He sent knights to the king's army in Ireland in 1210, and in 1212 was briefly appointed sheriff of Northumberland with custody of several castles seized from northern barons suspected of plotting against the king. Over the next two years he took charge of various baronial hostages surrendered to the king, and in 1213 acted as one of the king's guarantors for the terms of peace with the church, intended to put an end to the papal interdict on England and to encourage the exiled English bishops to return. In 1214 he sent knights to the king's army in Poitou.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of civil war Warenne sided with the crown: he carried out negotiations with the rebel barons at Northampton, and in June 1215 was named as one of the royalists present at the issue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. He attended the siege of Rochester in November 1215 and, once again, was involved in a parley with the rebel barons. Thereafter he served as royalist commander in Sussex and on 26 May 1216 was sent to take charge of the Cinque Ports. However, on 6 June 1216 the rebel army commanded by Louis of France was allowed to enter Warenne's castle at Reigate unopposed, and later that month, at Winchester, Warenne himself came to the French prince and offered him his support. Possibly he hoped that Louis would restore his estates in Normandy. Like the earls of Salisbury and Arundel, and the count of Aumale who defected at the same time, he may have believed the Plantagenet cause to be doomed. Alternatively it has been suggested that he had a more personal grievance against King John, who many years before had conducted an adulterous affair with one of Warenne's sisters, mother of the royal bastard Richard fitz Roy (or de Warenne); but this seems an improbable motive for rebellion given that the affair had taken place twenty years before and that Warenne was himself the son of Earl Hamelin, another royal bastard. Warenne remained in rebellion for less than a year. As early as March 1217 he was in receipt of instructions from King Henry III over land at Stamford, and at Chichester on about 17 April he entered into a truce with the royalists, negotiated by the papal legate Guala. Probably to safeguard his interests in France he was scrupulous in his approach to his former French allies, and in June 1217 sent formal letters to Louis notifying him of his decision to abandon the rebel camp. Although he himself took no part in the naval battle off Sandwich on 24 August 1217, he equipped a ship of knights which was one of the first to engage the French fleet, and which took many prisoners. In the aftermath Warenne was prominent in the negotiations which put an end to the war. His own interests were at stake here, since after the battle of Sandwich he had paid more than 1000 marks to the men of the Cinque Ports to take possession of various French prisoners, from whom he clearly hoped to extract heavy ransoms. The treaty arranged in September forbade any such ransom payments, so that Warenne was forced to accept an undertaking from his fellow royalists that he would be refunded the 1000 marks from the royal exchequer. The problems involved in obtaining this money ensured that for much of the next decade Warenne was dependent upon loans and occasional payments from the crown. He also borrowed heavily from his kinsman the justiciar Hubert de Burgh, who had married the daughter and heir of William de Warenne of Wormegay in Norfolk, a cousin of Earl William.<br>
<br>His kinship to Hubert de Burgh was to prove very useful to Warenne after 1217 in enabling him to obtain favours from the royal court. In 1218 he successfully pursued a claim to the sheriffdom of Surrey, disputed during the civil war by the alien royalist Engelard de Cigogn&eacute;. He remained sheriff of Surrey until November 1226. In 1219 he was one of those who attended the funeral procession of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, from Caversham to the Temple Church in London, and in the same year he obtained the restoration of her estates to Alice, countess of Eu, his niece, who through negotiation had succeeded in recovering her lands both in Normandy and in England. Acting as custodian on Alice's behalf, Warenne henceforth enjoyed custody of the honours and castles of Tickhill in Yorkshire and Hastings in Sussex. His possession of Tickhill was vigorously resisted by a local magnate, Robert de Vieuxpont, leading for a time to the threat of violent unrest. In 1220 he was prominent in negotiations with the French and with the king of Scots, Alexander II, and in 1221 he sent knights to the army dispatched to recover Bytham Castle on behalf of Henry III. In the spring of 1223 he made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, but returned in time to serve on the king's campaign against Montgomery, providing the king with twenty knights, and witnessing the eventual terms of truce with the Welsh. During the winter of 1223&#150;4 he supported Hubert de Burgh against his rivals at court. He joined the army besieging Bedford Castle in 1224 and afterwards was appointed to conduct the disgraced alien constable, Falkes de Br&eacute;aut&eacute;, into exile. Probably in reward for his loyalty he was granted custody of the royal castle of Bramber, and the castle of Hornby in Lancashire. However, in November 1226 he was replaced as sheriff of Surrey and in February 1227 was forced to surrender Hornby to its rightful heir.<br>
<br>These disappointments may help to explain Warenne's involvement in a brief confederation against the crown, led between July and October 1227 by the king's brother Richard of Cornwall and the earls of Pembroke and Chester, confirmed at Warenne's manor of Stamford. In the aftermath Warenne was forced to surrender his custody of Tickhill, but his disgrace was short-lived. In 1228 he was confirmed in possession of the manors of Stamford and Grantham for life, and for the first time received the third penny of the county of Surrey, an honorary payment due to the earl of any particular county, but which seems previously to have been denied to Warenne and his father, despite their claim to be recognized as earls of Surrey by right of Warenne's mother. In 1230, during the king's expedition to Brittany, Warenne was appointed keeper of the ports of the English east coast, and in the following year he served with the king's army in Wales. In 1232 he was involved, albeit incidentally, in the disgrace of his former protector, Hubert de Burgh, being one of the four earls appointed to keep de Burgh prisoner at Devizes Castle. However, he seems to have remained sympathetic to de Burgh, and after the fall of Hubert's persecutors in 1234, returned to government, accepting the surrender of the castles of Bramber and Knepp from de Burgh's enemies. He served as a ceremonial cup-bearer at the coronation of Queen Eleanor in 1236, and in 1237 witnessed the reissue of <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span> as one of the few surviving barons who had witnessed the charter of 1215. In the same year he was admitted to the king's council, and in 1238 was sent to defend the papal legate Otto against violent attacks at Oxford.<br>
<br>Warenne married twice: first, before 1207, Matilda, daughter of William d'Aubigny, earl of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1223). She is said to have died, childless, on 6 February 1215, and was buried at Lewes. His second wife, another Matilda, was the eldest daughter of William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke, and widow of Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk (<i>d</i>. 1225). Warenne purchased her marriage and her dower in Norfolk before July 1225. She outlived him by several years, and died in April 1248. Her body was buried at Tintern Abbey and her heart at Lewes. Warenne died in London on 27 or 28 May 1240, and was buried before the high altar of his family's foundation at Lewes in Sussex. The king ordered that a wayside cross be erected in his memory, on the road between Merton and Carshalton in Surrey. With Matilda Marshal Warenne had two children: a son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28734/', "John de Warenne")</script>, who succeeded to his father's estates in 1248, and a daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60821/', "Isabel de Warenne (1226x30&#150;1282)")</script>, married to Hugh d'Aubigny, earl of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1243). During his lifetime Warenne had been a regular patron of religious foundations. He granted or confirmed lands to the priories of Lewes, St Michael Stamford, and the Holy Sepulchre at Thetford, and at some time between 1219 and 1222 founded a Cluniac cell at Sleves Holm near Methwold, dependent upon Castle Acre Priory. In Normandy, before December 1203, he made gifts to the monks of Bonne-Nouvelle, and in 1223 he confirmed land at Little Palgrave in Norfolk to the monks of St Riquier in Picardy. He also supported the foundation by his subtenant, Hugh de Pleiz, of an Augustinian priory at Broomhill in Norfolk, and is credited, not entirely convincingly, with the foundation of priories or hospitals at Reigate and Stamford. His daughter, Isabel, widow of Hugh d'Aubigny, earl of Arundel, founded a Cistercian nunnery at Marham in Norfolk, on land that she had received from Warenne in dower. Warenne was the last survivor of the Anglo-Norman aristocracy who had held land in both France and England before 1204. It is clear that throughout his life he endeavoured to maintain the links between England and Normandy, in the hope that the old Anglo-Norman realm might one day be re-established.<br>
