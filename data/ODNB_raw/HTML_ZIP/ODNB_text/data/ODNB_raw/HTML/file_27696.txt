<span class="headword">Tremenheere,  Hugh Seymour</span>  (1804&#150;1893), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Wootton House, Gloucestershire, on 22 January 1804, the eldest son of Walter Tremenheere and his wife, Frances, daughter of Thomas Apperley.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_27696"></a><span class="headword">Walter Tremenheere</span>  (1761&#150;1855), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Penzance on 10 September 1761, and saw action in the American, French revolutionary, and Napoleonic wars. He was lieutenant-governor of Cura&ccedil;ao, colonel-commandant of the Chatham division of the Royal Marines, and briefly aide-de-camp to William IV, for which last he was appointed KH in 1832. He was known for his Cornish landscape drawings. He died at 33 Somerset Street, Portman Square, London, on 7 August 1855. Two of his sons soldiered in India. George Borlase Tremenheere (1809&#150;1896), lieutenant-colonel of the Bengal Engineers, served in the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars; in retirement he commanded the western battalion of the Duke of Cornwall's volunteers and was president of the Indian Mutiny Relief Fund. Charles William Tremenheere (1813&#150;1898), major-general of the Bombay Engineers, fought in the Indian mutiny (for which he was made CB), was commandant at Aden, and wrote <span class="italic">Missions in India: the System of Education in Government and Mission Schools Contrasted</span> (1876). Another son, John Henry Tremenheere (1807&#150;1880), was a prolific contributor to periodical literature.<br>
<br>Hugh Seymour Tremenheere was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford (BA 1827, MA 1832), and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1834. Appointed a revising barrister on the western circuit in 1838, he inspected schools for the education department (1839&#150;43), and mines (1843&#150;59) and other industries (1855&#150;71) for the Home Office. He was a fellow of New College from 1824 until his marriage, on 2 April 1856, to Lucy Bernal, third daughter of Ralph Bernal MP, and widow of Vicesimus Knox.<br>
<br>Tremenheere's interest in working-class education began with his membership of the Central Society of Education, a body that published papers on teaching methods and child psychology and lobbied for state-run schools on the Irish model (which kept religious and secular training separate). When the new education committee of the privy council filled its posts in 1839, Tremenheere was appointed to inspect schools of the nonconformist-dominated British and Foreign School Society. His appointment came through the influence of B. F. Duppa, the Central Society's secretary, who knew the lord president of the council Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, marquess of Lansdowne. A moderate Anglican whig, Tremenheere was not likely to alienate the society. His first mission, to Monmouthshire and Herefordshire in December 1839, officially to survey the state of education, involved an inquiry into the causes of John Frost's Newport rising.<br>
<br>Tremenheere co-operated with the education department's permanent secretary, James Kay-Shuttleworth, in promoting efficient education to teach working-class children their place in society, and aligned himself with non-sectarianism against &#145;our opponents the High Churchmen &amp; the Newmanites&#146;  (Paz, 109). The British and Foreign School Society, however, resented the negative tone of his reports, which criticized its use of the monitorial teaching method. It also felt aggrieved because, unlike the Church of England and the Church of Scotland, it had no control over the appointment of the inspector of its schools. After the defeat of the Peel ministry's <span class="roman">Factory Bill</span> in 1843, the government was forced to settle the dispute with the British and Foreign School Society over inspection, and did so by transferring Tremenheere to the Home Office at the end of the year.<br>
<br>At the Home Office Tremenheere was appointed by Sir James Graham as inspector under the <span class="roman">Mines Act</span>, 1842. In his annual reports on the mining districts he advocated education to teach obedience, free-market economics, and the evils of trade unions. Education would &#145;fortify the mind [of the pitmen's children] against attempts at misdirection&#146; from &#145;agitators of their own class&#146;, and promote &#145;the growth of morality and social order&#146;  (Colls, 92). Tremenheere encouraged colliery owners to build schools, and discouraged working-class self-education and schools outside the control of other agencies. Although he interviewed workers and union leaders, his sympathies were on the side of the employers. He saw his main task as the reporting of social conditions in the mining regions, rather than the enforcing of safety regulations. He visited Belgium, France, and Germany to study mining laws and underground inspection in those countries, and recommended that Britain adopt underground inspection. The <span class="roman">Mines Act</span>, 1850, of which Tremenheere was the architect, provided for the appointment of inspectors with technical qualifications who would use their expertise to advise colliery managers and encourage them to emulate one another, rather than to force improvements. He was however, energetic in reducing the incidence of the truck system in mining, and the payment of miners' wages in public houses.<br>
<br>The Home Office gave Tremenheere additional tasks in the 1850s and 1860s. He investigated bleaching works (1855), lace works (1861), and bakehouses; he served on royal commissions on the employment of children and young persons in both industry (1862&#150;7) and agriculture (1867&#150;71). In these activities he continued to express his opposition to trade unions, and his beliefs that the state should cajole rather than coerce employers, and that ideologically correct education should be provided to the working classes. He retired from government service in 1871, receiving a CB.<br>
<br>In retirement Tremenheere opposed Irish home rule and church disestablishment, and addressed political pamphlets to a working-class audience, which were published by the Christian Knowledge Society and the Liberal Unionist Association. A contributor to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (1837&#150;9), <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> (1881), and <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span> (1880), his other publications included a comparison of the constitutions of Great Britain and the USA (1854), following a tour of North America in 1852, and in <span class="italic">The Political Expertise of the Ancients, in its Bearing upon Modern Times</span> (1852). He died at Silverdale, Alexandra Road, Farnborough, Hampshire, on 16 September 1893.<br>
