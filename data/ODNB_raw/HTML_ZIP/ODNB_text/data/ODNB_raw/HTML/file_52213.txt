<span class="headword">Picard <span class="st"> [Pycard]</span>,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1361), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, was descended from a family of Picardy merchants settled in London possibly since the late thirteenth century. A vintner, royal financier, and shipowner, Picard dealt in wine, wool, cloth, and malt, and established a substantial overseas trade. He supplied the king's wardrobe and was closely involved with alien merchants resident in London, dealing with merchants of the Hanse of Germany, the town of Dordrecht, and the city of Florence. Trading overseas was not without its difficulties. In 1350&#150;1 the mayor and aldermen of London protested on Picard's behalf to Edward III and the authorities of Florence concerning the illegal seizure of his goods during a time of political tension. Again, in 1359, the mayor and aldermen wrote to the town authorities at Dordrecht demanding the release of a ship owned by Picard and Thomas Nottingham, mercer and London citizen, that had been seized in payment of an alleged debt disowned by Picard and Nottingham.<br>
<br>Picard had property interests in London and Calais. Thanks to his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Thomas Gisors, pepperer, and granddaughter of John (III) Gisors (<i>d</i>. 1351), twice mayor of London, he inherited all the property belonging to John Gisors in the parish of St Martin Vintry, including Gisors's main residence called The Vintry, and the rent of 100 marks charged on Gisors Hall in the parish of St Mildred, Bread Street, which later became known as Gerard's Hall. In the will of John Pulteney (<i>d</i>. 1349) Picard was left the right of first refusal on the purchase of Coldharbour Mansion in Vintry ward. It was in this mansion that Picard's legendary entertainment of the five kings&#151;Edward III of England, Jean I of France, David of Scotland, Waldemar of Denmark, and Peter of Cyprus&#151;took place. This famous event, variously dated by Stow to 1357 and 1363, is most likely to have occurred in the former year, when Picard was mayor of London and a mayor crown financier, when Edward III was not on campaign, and when David of Scotland and the French king were prisoners in England awaiting ransom. Stow's account involved the kings of England, France, Scotland, and Cyprus only. The king of Denmark and other nobles who attended were later additions to the story by Joshua Barnes, in his <span class="italic">History of Edward III</span> of 1688. In memory of this feast the tradition was established that the toast of the Vintners' Company be followed by five cheers&#151;a tradition still maintained in the late twentieth century.<br>
<br>Picard was alderman of Bishopsgate ward from 1348 to 1361, sheriff in 1349, and mayor in 1357. He represented the city at royal councils and merchant assemblies in 1349, 1351, 1356, and 1358. A very wealthy man who provided the exchequer with no less than fifty-eight loans, ranging from a few hundred pounds to &pound;13,333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., Picard supplied many of these sums alone, but the more substantial loans were made in collaboration with other merchants, both English and foreign. In 1346 he also contributed to a city loan to the king. Picard regularly acted as a middleman between the crown and the alien merchants resident in London when they lent money to the king, and he also acted as guarantor. In January 1346 he was involved in the negotiations between the crown and the merchants of London and Bruges when the crown of England was pledged as security for a loan of &pound;13,333 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. Undoubtedly his financial support to the crown gave him influence, for example when in November 1360 he obtained a royal pardon for Gilbert Wendlinburgh, a German merchant and one of Picard's business partners, for various offences, including the rape of Marguerite, wife of Jacques de Navarre. He held a number of royal appointments, including collector of the cloth custom throughout the realm in 1350, king's butler from 1350 to 1359, clerk of recognizances in London from 1356 until his death, and commissioner of array in London, Kent, and Essex in 1360. In May 1358 he was granted an annual pension of &pound;50 for life from the customs revenue of London. He acted as an executor with Adam Fraunceys, mercer and mayor of London, of the will of Henry Causton, mercer.<br>
<br>Henry Picard died before 3 July 1361, but his will was not enrolled until July 1365. In his will he left property to a John Picard senior and a John Picard junior, possibly his sons. One son, John, predeceased him. Both John Picard senior and John Picard junior were dead by 1368 when the London letter-books describe William Picard, a kinsman, as Henry Picard's heir.<br>
