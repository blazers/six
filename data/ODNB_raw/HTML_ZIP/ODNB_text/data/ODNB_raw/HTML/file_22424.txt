<span class="headword">Pocock,  Lewis</span>  (1808&#150;1882), <span class="occ">art patron</span>, was born in London on 17 January 1808, the third and youngest son of John Thomas Pocock (1776&#150;1832), the proprietor of St Bride's Wharf, Fleet Street, and his wife, Margaret (1782&#150;1811), daughter of John Kennedy (1759&#150;1842), the co-owner of the Vineyard nursery, Hammersmith. The Pocock family had come to London from Berkshire about 1750 and prospered as speculative builders. Connections with France made by Kennedy when working for the Empress Josephine on the gardens of Malmaison led to Lewis being educated at Tours. When young, he lived at St Bride's Wharf and at his father's suburban house, at 6 Greville Place, Kilburn, and, later, at 4 Albion Place, Southwark. On his father's death, his inheritance supported his patronage of the arts and new artistic technology.<br>
<br>The writer Fanny Rivi&egrave;re (Mrs C. H. Smith) recalled that in 1834 Pocock was &#145;a handsome young man of good means&#146;, who patronized art and attended most of the literary and scientific institutions. He was often accompanied by his friend the architect George Godwin, with whom, in 1836, he founded the Art Union of London, a subscription society to encourage young artists and the appreciation of art; the two men became honorary joint secretaries. The union was one manifestation of a growing enthusiasm for the arts among the rapidly expanding middle classes; encouraged by the patronage of the prince consort as well as the publicity of the union, the emergence of this new public for art was to culminate in the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the founding of museums and galleries throughout the country.<br>
<br>The Art Union published a monthly journal, books, prints, and Parian reproductions of sculpture; it also organized artistic competitions, awarded prizes, and pressed for the subsidization of public art galleries. Pocock himself wrote the introduction to an edition of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>, illustrated by H. C. Selous and published by the Art Union in 1844, and to a poem inspired by the Lord's prayer by Dean Henry Alford of Canterbury, illustrated by Frederick Pickersgill. He commissioned a large painting in oils, <span class="italic">The Proscribed Royalist</span>, from the young John Everett Millais in 1852; his own collection also included paintings by J. M. W. Turner. Samuel Johnson having lived near his house, he made a notable collection of Johnsoniana which was sold by Sothebys in 1875.<br>
<br>Pocock advised the guiding committees of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and supported the establishment of the South Kensington (later the Victoria and Albert) Museum; he was also a fellow of the Society of Arts. Pocock's interests spread beyond art: the scientist Michael Faraday was a friend and, in 1852, Pocock himself patented a scheme for &#145;electric lighting combined with the production of colour and power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Union of London Annual Report</span>, 1883) and another for purifying sea water. Pocock was also involved in the early development of photography, and served as treasurer for the Graphic Society. As a director of the Argus Life Assurance office, he published <span class="italic">A Familiar Explanation of the Nature of Assurances upon Lives</span> (1842).<br>
<br>On 6 September 1838 Pocock married Eliza (1816&#150;1894), the daughter of George Bassett (1773&#150;1846), architect and land surveyor; they had twelve children. They lived in London, first in Gloucester Road, Regent's Park, and then in Bloomsbury, at 29 Montague Street. Later, they moved to 28 Gordon Square. Subsequently, they moved to 20 Upper Gower Street and, in 1869, to 70 Gower Street, where Pocock died on 17 October 1882; he and his wife were both buried in Highgate cemetery. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> of 23 December 1882 noted that:<blockquote>he believed in the refining influence of all things beautiful to the eye and he zealously devoted himself to the diffusion of works of art among the people, in order that the pleasures of what he held to be the highest sense might be enjoyed by the many instead of the chosen few.</blockquote>
