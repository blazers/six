<span class="headword">Thompson,  George Donisthorpe</span>  (1804&#150;1878), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist</span>, born at Liverpool on 18 June 1804, was the third son of Thomas Thompson of Leicester and his wife, Elizabeth Donisthorpe. In 1831 he married Anne Erskine, daughter of Richard Spry, a minister in the Methodist Connexion of the countess of Huntingdon. They had six children. He first became widely known as a propagandist for the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. In October 1833 a series of lectures by him led to the formation of &#145;the Edinburgh Society for the abolition of slavery throughout the world&#146;. He also lectured and took part in public discussions in Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Bath, and elsewhere. In September 1834 he undertook a mission to the United States. He worked with William Lloyd Garrison, John Greenleaf Whittier, and the members of the American Anti-Slavery Society in the movement for the abolition of slavery, and was instrumental in forming more than 300 abolitionist branch associations. He is said to have caused by his speeches the failure of Thomas Jefferson Randolph's so-called &#145;post natal t&#146; plan for slave emancipation in Virginia and he was denounced by General Andrew Jackson in a presidential message.<br>
<br>Thompson's life was frequently in danger, and in December 1835 he was forced to escape from Boston in an open boat to a British vessel bound for New Brunswick, from where he sailed back to Britain. On his return he was enthusiastically received at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne, and other large towns. He revisited the United States in 1851, and again during the American Civil War, when a public reception was given to him in the house of representatives, in the presence of President Lincoln and the majority of the cabinet. He was made an honorary LLD by the Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, on 21 July 1864.<br>
<br>Thompson was associated with Joseph Hume, Sir Joshua Walmsley, and other prominent Liberal radicals in the National Parliamentary Reform Association. He was also a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>, and took part in forming the British India Association, visiting India to study its governance. In 1846 he was presented with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh. On 31 July 1847 he was returned to parliament for the Tower Hamlets constituency, a seat he retained until 1852, and about 1870 a testimonial was raised for him by his friends in Britain and the United States. He settled at Leeds and died there on 7 October 1878.<br>
<br>Thompson was a brilliant speaker, and well regarded socially. John Bright &#145;always considered him the liberator of the slaves in the English colonies&#146;. His second daughter, Amelia, married Frederick William Chesson, secretary to the Aborigines Protection Society.<br>
