<span class="headword">Sheridan,  William</span>  (1635&#150;1711), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of Ireland bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh</span>, was born in Togher, near Kilmore, co. Cavan, the eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67233/', "Denis Sheridan (c.1610&#150;1683?)")</script>, vicar of Killesher, co. Fermanagh, and his first wife, Jane (<i>c</i>.1610&#150;<i>c</i>.1643), daughter of Anthony Atkinson of Geashill, King's county. A member of a Gaelic Irish family long associated with the district of Kilmore, his father had been brought up a protestant in the house of John Hill, dean of Kilmore. William was named after his godfather, Bishop William Bedell, who had ordained his father and left the youth 40<i>s</i>. in his will to buy a mourning ring. He had a brother, Patrick (1638&#150;1682), and two half-brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25368/', "Thomas Sheridan (1646&#150;1712)")</script> and James (<i>b</i>. 1649). William was privately educated, partly by his father, before he and his brother Patrick entered Trinity College, Dublin, as fellow-commoners in May 1652. Although his first degree is not recorded, he graduated DD in 1682. At an unknown date he married Mary O'Reilly, presumably also from co. Cavan, with whom he had a son, Donald.<br>
<br>After his ordination Sheridan was chaplain to Sir Maurice Eustace, the first lord chancellor of Ireland after the Restoration, and was subsequently chaplain to the duke of Ormond. Rector of Athenry, co. Galway, in 1667, he became dean of Down two years later (25 August 1669), though he was in England that autumn and had permission to remain there until his health recovered. In fact poor health was to be a recurring theme of his correspondence later in his life. During Ormond's last viceroyalty, and thanks to his influence, Sheridan was formally appointed bishop of Kilmore in January 1682 (though at first intended for Raphoe), holding it with the diocese of Ardagh. His brother Patrick had been appointed bishop of Cloyne in 1679.<br>
<br>Sheridan seems to have left Ireland in the latter part of James II's reign. Unlike four other Church of Ireland bishops, he did not sit in James II's Irish parliament of May&#150;June 1689, though unlike them he was deprived under William III for not taking the necessary oaths prescribed by the 1691 act. As the only nonjuring bishop in the Church of Ireland, he moved to London, where he lived close to other nonjurors. Impoverished, in poor health, and continuing to sign himself &#145;Wm Kilmore&#146; (sometimes adding &#145;dispossest.&#146;), he was clearly on the conscience of some at least of the conforming clergy. William King of Derry did what he could to help, and was warmly thanked by Sheridan, as was the tory earl of Huntingdon, for whose &#145;so often repeated charity &hellip; I want words to express my gratitude&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.300).<br>
<br>At the beginning of Queen Anne's reign an attempt associated with the lay nonjuror Henry Dodwell to heal the schism in the Church of Ireland, which by this stage effectively centred on Sheridan, petered out. However, for a time thereafter he was apparently paid an allowance out of Kilmore diocesan coffers, a voluntary support which had come to an end before mid-1707, Archbishop King being told in 1708 that Sheridan's successor but one in Kilmore, Edward Wetenhall, &#145;has not sent him one penny since last midsummer was a year, and then but tenn guineas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Second Report</span>, HMC, 244). It was ironic that it should be Wetenhall who failed to keep up payments on Sheridan's allowance, as he had sat in James II's parliament as bishop of Cork and had required convincing in 1691 that William and Mary were lawful sovereigns. Having endured years of poor health, during which he was cared for by a niece who herself became ill in the process, Sheridan died in London on 3 October 1711 and was buried later that month at Fulham.<br>
