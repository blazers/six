<span class="headword">Sheehy,  Nicholas</span>  (1728/9&#150;1766), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born near Fethard, co. Tipperary, Ireland. Little is known about his parents except that his mother's maiden name was Power. He was educated in Louvain, Belgium, and ordained in Rome in 1752, and upon his return to Ireland he became curate of Newcastle, co. Tipperary, and later parish priest of a group of parishes centring on Clogheen, co. Tipperary. Clogheen became the centre of serious agrarian disturbances, led by the Whiteboys, in the early 1760s. Their chief grievances were the enclosure of commons and the high rent for potato ground, both of which resulted in the displacement of settlements. As the latter were the source of income for Catholic priests such as Sheehy, they were now left with little or nothing. These circumstances may have predisposed Sheehy to concur with Whiteboy aims. He encouraged resistance to the collection of 5<i>s</i>. for every marriage celebrated in the area around Ballyporeen, co. Tipperary, a novel claim advanced by a tithe farmer in 1762. He opposed the collection of church rates and tithes in the Newcastle area. R. R. Madden suggested that Sheehy collected money for the defence of those of his parishioners accused of Whiteboy crimes, and thus their acquittal was attributed to him. His apparent encouragement of this agitation was to mark him out as an enemy of the government and protestant gentry.<br>
<br>The 1760s saw the coincidence in time and place of a unique set of circumstances which caused protestants in the region to feel insecure in the face of, as they perceived it, a new assertiveness on the part of Catholics. Sheehy was seen by the county gentry as a ringleader in raising a rebellion to undo the land settlement, reverse the penal laws, and unite with the French. Multiple expressions of Catholic assertiveness, compounded by their inability to obtain convictions for Whiteboy offences, broke the nerve of the local gentry and unleashed a sectarian campaign, one victim of which was Sheehy.<br>
<br>Sheehy was presented by the grand jury at the summer assizes of 1762 for being an unregistered priest. This invoked a statute which had fallen into disuse, but nothing apparently came of the charge. In May 1763 he was indicted for forcing people not to inform against the Whiteboys, but the charge appears to have been dropped. Indictments for high treason, rebellion, and assault followed in 1764, but no convictions ensued. Frustrated at this, the local gentry influenced the government to issue a proclamation in February 1765 offering &pound;300 for Sheehy's capture. Shortly after he surrendered voluntarily, and the government conceded to his wish to stand trial in Dublin rather than in Tipperary, where justice was likely to be more partial. Although he was bailed in June 1765 to the amount of &pound;4000, it took eleven months before he stood trial in February 1766, largely because of questionable delays in assembling the prosecution case. At his trial he was acquitted as the prosecution witnesses proved unreliable, an outcome not entirely unforeseen by his prosecutors, who now brought forward a murder charge for which Sheehy was to be tried in Tipperary rather than Dublin, a concession which reneged on the original government assurance. The charge related to the disappearance in late 1764 of John Bridge, a key informant against Sheehy. The defence case rested on the unreliability of the prosecution witnesses, on an alibi for Sheehy's location on the night of the supposed murder, and on the lack of evidence that the victim had actually been murdered, since the body was never located and, in fact, Bridge was later rumoured to have gone to Newfoundland. None the less, on 12 March 1766 Sheehy was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, which followed in Clonmel on 15 March. Prior to his execution, Sheehy, in a letter to Major Joseph Sirr, suggested that the real murderers of Bridge had been revealed to him in the confessional but, by virtue of his clerical office, he could not use this information in his own defence. He was buried in Shanrahan graveyard.<br>
<br>Most believed the murder charge to be spurious. Popular reaction among Catholics was exemplified in the stoning to death of Sheehy's executioner in 1770. Protestants outside the region did not view the charges as credible. Such were the proceedings against Sheehy regarded that the term &#145;Sheehy's jury&#146; became a derogatory one applied to any jury which acted in an arbitrary fashion. Of the members of the grand jury that condemned Sheehy, the majority reportedly came to sad and sudden ends, which has been interpreted as divine retribution for their action. Within a short time Sheehy was accorded the status of martyr, and there were regular and well-attended pilgrimages to his grave. He became the subject of a number of poems and laments. Sheehy's memory was perpetuated in the context of the land war of the 1880s when he was cited as an exemplar of priestly leadership and collective action. The centenary celebrations of the 1798 rebellion in 1898 saw the erection of a memorial tablet on his grave site.<br>
<br>Sheehy's execution was one of the most significant events in eighteenth-century Ireland. It exemplified intense sectarian animosities and it cast the government, the local gentry, and the Catholic hierarchy in an unfavourable light.<br>
