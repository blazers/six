<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mitrinovi&#263;,  Dimitrije</span>  (1887&#150;1953), <span class="occ">philosopher and social critic</span>, was born into a Serbian Orthodox family at Donje Poplat, a small village near Stolac in Herzegovina, on 21 October 1887, the eldest of ten children. His father, Mihailo Mitrinovi&#263;, was a civil servant in charge of an experimental farm and his mother, Vidosova, was a schoolteacher. He attended the Mostar Gymnasium and, in 1907, enrolled at Zagreb University where he studied philosophy, psychology, and logic. He became a significant figure in the Young Bosnia movement, a nationalist grouping of south Slavs who sought a cultural and moral renaissance as part of the struggle against the yoke of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and between 1907 and 1913 he wrote regularly for the journal <span class="italic">Bosanska Vila</span>. <br>
<br>By 1914 Mitrinovi&#263; was attending Munich University, where he studied the history of art under Heinrich Wolfflin. He became associated with circles around the artist Wassily Kandinsky and the Blauer Reiter group. Through Kandinsky he became involved with Erich Gutkind and the Dutchman Frederik van Eeeden in trying to establish a network of world figures from the arts, humanities, and sciences who would be able to exercise a positive influence on the course of history through their cultural and spiritual leadership, and avert the slide to war. <br>
<br>The outbreak of the First World War placed Mitrinovi&#263; in a vulnerable position, as he was liable to conscription into the Austro-Hungarian army, and was also under suspicion as a Serbian passport-holder known to the secret police. He made his way to London where he was to live until his death. He never married and never took British citizenship. On his arrival in August 1914 he obtained a position within the Serbian legation in London, and busied himself learning English, proselytizing for the cause of a Yugoslav federation, and forming friendships with exiled Serbs including the Serbian Orthodox priest Nicolai Velimrovi&#263; and, later, the leader of the Serbian Social Democratic Party, D&#365;san Popovi&#263;. He promoted the work of the sculptor Ivan Mestrovi&#263;: at an exhibition of Mestrovi&#263;'s work at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1915 he encountered Philip Mairet who described him as &#145;a tall dark handsome man, attired in the black frock coat of an official or a business executive, who spoke with a strong foreign accent but with noticeable freedom, fluency and even eloquence&#146;  (Sisson, 85). He studied at the British Museum library and gave private classes in oriental and ancient philosophy to a small group of people who were attracted to him, including Mairet, the art collector Gladys MacDermot, and Valerie Cooper, a Bloomsbury-based musician and teacher of dance. <br>
<br>Mitrinovi&#263; was out to make his intellectual mark and eventually he was introduced to Alfred Orage, the editor of <span class="italic">The New Age</span>, a leading weekly of that period with a political orientation towards guild socialism and financial reform along social credit lines. Commencing in August 1920 Mitrinovi&#263; contributed a series of articles to <span class="italic">The New Age</span> under the collective title of &#145;World affairs&#146;. The overall theme was the portrayal of the world as a complex evolving organism, whose organs were constituted by the different races and nations, each having its own character relating to its appropriate function in the context of the world as a whole. The individual was likened to a single cell within this organism, each a constituent part of a common humanity sharing a single world. He affirmed that history was evolving in the direction of the conscious realization by individuals of their membership of this unified whole. In sketching out this vision Mitrinovi&#263; was drawing on a long tradition, but was particularly influenced by the ideas of the Russian theologian Vladimir Solovyov. <br>
<br>While he was developing these ideas Mitrinovi&#263; was widening and deepening his circle of friends and associates in London, seeking to involve them in his project. For him the spirit of organic unity could only be born within the minds and spirits of individuals. If the world was to change, individuals must change. The competitive individualism and egotism of the contemporary age had to be transcended. The key transformative process was the assumption by individuals of responsibility to live their lives in association with others in full consciousness of their responsibilities as members of a common humanity. The organic growth of &#145;universal humanity&#146; could start with individuals prepared freely to commit themselves to one another in open and equal alliance. <br>
<br>This was to become the dominant motif in Mitrinovi&#263;'s life&#151;the preparation of groups of individuals for a new world-transforming initiative, to which he gave the name Senate. Their function would be to work in and through all levels of society, helping people and groups to relate to each other as constituent members of a common human household. Their key resource would be the ability to view all human problems from the perspective of the world as a whole. <br>
<br>In 1927 Mitrinovi&#263; founded the British section of the Adler Society (International Society for Individual Psychology) to develop this project. He was particularly taken with Alfred Adler's emphasis on the responsibility of individuals for their own feelings and actions, and his belief in the innate potential of human beings for co-operation and mutual aid. The Adler Society in London became a centre for lectures, seminars, and workshops exploring different dimensions of the relationship between the individual and the macro-level of global transformation. He was also associated with the establishment in 1926 of what became known as the Chandos Group, named after the hotel where they met fortnightly to explore ways in which Britain might be transformed in accordance with the principles of guild socialism and social credit. Among their number were Mairet and the Christian sociologist Maurice Reckitt. <br>
<br>Another initiative was the New Europe Group. Launched in 1931 with Patrick Geddes as its first president, its proclaimed aim was to promote European federation from below, as a step towards world federation. In 1932 the New Europe Group spawned the New Britain Group as another medium for the propagation of Mitrinovi&#263;'s vision. Drawing on the ideas of Rudolph Steiner with regard to the &#145;threefold state&#146;, the New Britain Group, whose members included the chemist Frederick Soddy, advocated the functional division of public life into three spheres, economic, political, and cultural. Each should be guided by different principles&#151;equality in the economic realm, fellowship in the political domain, and liberty in the cultural sphere. From the start the New Britain Group pursued a very active propaganda programme and in 1933 a weekly newspaper was published under the editorship of Charles Purdom, the propagandist for garden cities. Sales grew to over 32,000, and Mitrinovi&#263; availed himself of the paper's columns to write a second series of &#145;World affairs&#146; articles under the pseudonym of M. M. Cosmoi. Local New Britain groups were established around Britain and a movement grew up around the paper. <br>
<br>Tensions soon emerged between those who sought to turn the new movement into a political party, and those around Mitrinovi&#263; who saw the initiative as just one phase in the deeper process of sowing the seeds of a new world order. At its first national conference, held at Leamington in March 1934, the New Britain movement was split asunder. <br>
<br>Mitrinovi&#263; was associated with a number of other public initiatives in the years before the Second World War, including the House of Industry League, which sought to promote guild socialism. However, the main focus of activity was with his inner core of friends and associates with whom he embarked upon a sustained educational experiment aimed at developing their capacities as &#145;universal individuals&#146; or what might now be called cosmopolitan citizens of the world. The bulk of his associates at this stage were idealistic, middle-class, young people who had become involved in the New Britain movement and had gradually been attracted to the central group at its heart. Alan Watts later recalled that &#145;the atmosphere of Mitrinovi&#263; fascinated me&#151;his humour, the power of his eyes and voice, his secretive and night-owl habits, his oracular way of writing (under the pseudonym of M. M. Cosmoi) and his exotic tastes in art and literature&#146;  (Watts, 110). Others who were part of Mitrinovi&#263;'s circle during this period included Winifred Gordon Fraser, Harry Christian Rutherford, Ellen Mayne, Violet MacDermot, the linguist David Shillan, Watson Thomson, and Ralph Twentyman. Throughout these years Mitrinovi&#263; received financial support for the initiatives and their publications from those in his circle who had the necessary funds. He also received a small pension from the kingdom of Yugoslavia. <br>
<br>With the outbreak of the Second World War the intensive group-work came to an end. Mitrinovi&#263; spent the war years in London. His health began to deteriorate and by 1950 he had moved to a house in Richmond where he was cared for by members of his most intimate circle. He died at his home, 114 Richmond Hill, Richmond, Surrey, on 28 August 1953 and was buried in Highgate cemetery. A memorial service was held at the Greek cathedral, Moscow Road, London, on 7 October 1953. Those who had been closest to him during the final years of his life established the New Atlantis Foundation to continue his work and spread his ideas by means of public lectures, publications, and related activities.<br>
