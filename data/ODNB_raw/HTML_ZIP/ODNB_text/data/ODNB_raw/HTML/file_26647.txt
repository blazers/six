<span class="headword">Stratford <span class="st"> [Hatton]</span>,  Ralph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1300&#150;1354), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was perhaps the son of Thomas Hatton&#151;so called from a place near Stratford upon Avon&#151;and of a sister of bishops <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26645/', "John Stratford")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26648/', "Robert Stratford")</script>. John's will describes him as <i>cognatus</i>, but the <span class="italic">Historia Roffensis</span> states that the archbishop was his uncle. He was regent MA at Oxford in 1329, and was delegate of the university for the confirmation of the chancellor's election in 1332, when he is termed BCL. In that year he was at Bologna, maintained, in accordance with the papal bull <span class="italic">Cum ex eo</span> under which he was licensed to pursue his studies, from the rectory of Mapledurham, Hampshire, to which John Stratford had collated him in 1329. By 1340 he was doctor of canon and civil law, perhaps of Bologna.<br>
<br>Academic qualifications, status as a king's clerk (so described in 1332), and the prominence of his uncles ensured Ralph Stratford's promotion to a succession of benefices. In 1332 he had papal provision to a canonry of York, while in 1333 he secured Erchesfont prebend in St Mary's Abbey, Winchester, exchanging it two years later for that of Blewbury in Salisbury Cathedral, which he resigned on his provision as treasurer (1336). He was to present a silver-gilt image of Our Lady to that cathedral. There followed royal presentation to a canonry and prebend at St Paul's, where the chapter elected him bishop on 26 January 1340. The king signified his assent three days later. The temporalities were restored on 13 February and consecration followed on 12 March at Canterbury. John Stratford, archbishop of Canterbury since 1333 and clearly influential in this promotion, officiated as consecrator.<br>
<br>Ralph Stratford and his uncle Robert gave loyal support to Archbishop Stratford in his conflict with Edward III in 1340&#150;41. As dean of the province of Canterbury, Ralph became responsible for circulating his uncle's letter <span class="italic">Sacrosancta ecclesia</span> in defence of ecclesiastical liberties. When the archbishop was refused entry to parliament in April 1341, Ralph and Robert accompanied him to the Painted Chamber in the palace of Westminster, while on 3 May the two kinsmen were named members of one of the committees that four days later presented proposals, subsequently embodied in a statute, for constitutional reform and the preservation of ecclesiastical liberties.<br>
<br>Despite his part in the crisis of 1340&#150;41 Ralph Stratford was not long out of royal favour. In 1342 he was empowered to treat with the king's continental allies and also with the French king. In 1345 he was a member of Lionel of Antwerp's council of regency during Edward III's absence in Flanders in July, and in November of that year he was appointed to treat with the papal envoy about relations with France. But after the archbishop's death in 1348 he took little part in public affairs, although, according to the chronicler Baker, in 1350 the king nominated him, together with Bishop William Bateman of Norwich (<i>d</i>. 1355), for the cardinalate.<br>
<br>Apart from joint political action there are other signs that Ralph Stratford was on good terms with his uncle John Stratford, who in his will left him Guido de Baysio's <span class="italic">Rosarium</span>, a copy of the <span class="italic">Speculum judiciale</span> purchased in Bologna, and an enamelled cup&#151;a present from Ralph. He fell ill in October 1348, and was relieved of the onus of administering his uncle's will. Four years later he arranged for the construction of suitable premises to house the chaplains of the late archbishop's college of St Thomas the Martyr at Stratford, buildings that were still standing in Leland's time. Ralph Stratford's episcopal register has not survived. According to Stow's <span class="italic">Survey</span>, in 1348, during the black death, he bought a croft named No Man's Land as a burial-ground&#151;later Pardon churchyard&#151;and built a chapel there, the adjoining land becoming the site of the London Charterhouse. But this has been questioned by the historian of the Charterhouse for lack of supporting evidence. Stratford died at Stepney, on 7 or 17 April 1354, and on the 28th his uncle Robert, bishop of Chichester, granted forty days' indulgence to those who prayed for his soul. He was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
