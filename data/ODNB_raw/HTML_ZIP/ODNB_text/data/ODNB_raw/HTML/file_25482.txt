<span class="headword">Shute,  Christopher</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was probably a younger son of Christopher Shute of Oakington, Cambridgeshire, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25486/', "Robert Shute (d. 1590)")</script>, the future judge, who was born at Gargrave, Yorkshire. He matriculated as a pensioner from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in the Michaelmas term of 1561, graduated BA early in 1565, and proceeded MA in 1568. &#145;Hand-picked&#146;  (Collinson, 208) by Archbishop Edmund Grindal, who had been master of the college when he was first an undergraduate, Shute was ordained at York in August 1572 and licensed to preach throughout the diocese and province. On the presentation of the queen, but probably through the influence of either Grindal or George Clifford, earl of Cumberland, the local magnate, Shute was on 15 July 1576 instituted vicar of Giggleswick, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>The following year Shute published the first edition of his catechism, <span class="italic">The Testimonie of a True Fayth</span>, and <span class="italic">A verie godlie and necessary sermon preached before the young countess of Cumberland &hellip; the 24 of November 1577</span>. The latter stressed obedience to the word of God and Christian assurance, and called for right administration of the sacraments and for ecclesiastical discipline. Shute proceeded BD in 1580, and in 1581 issued a new version of his catechism as <span class="italic">A Compendius Forme and Summe of Christian Doctrine</span>. Its dedication to the earl of Cumberland acknowledged his patronage and emphasized the role of the Christian magistrate.<br>
<br>Shute was, or became, one of Cumberland's wealthier tenants in the lordship of Craven. On 17 August 1581 at Giggleswick he married Katherine Newhouse. They had at least five sons&#151;Robert (<i>bap</i>. 1584), <a href="#cosubject_74238">Nathaniel [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25485/', "Josias Shute (bap. 1588, d. 1643)")</script>, <a href="#cosubject_74239">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_74240">Timothy [<i>see below</i>]</a>&#151;and two daughters, Margaret and Mary.<br>
<br>Shute was almost certainly the author of <span class="italic">A Brief Resolution of a Right Religion, Touching the Controversies that are nowe in England</span> (1590). He explained to his readers that &#145;I shall hazard my person in running uppon the cragged rockes of the pestilent toonged papistes &hellip; howbeit I mean well even to the Romish Catholickes themselves&#146;. In his dedication to Francis Flower, esquire and JP, the publisher John Proctor declared that, of all those tackling the subject, &#145;none &hellip; so largelie, and in such sweet maner deciphered true religion before, wherein contrarie sects are utterly put down, altogether making manifest what true faith is&#146;. The work contained a further commendation from &#145;R. Armin&#146;.<br>
<br>Shute was emerging as the pre-eminent leader of a flourishing and sometimes radical puritan tradition in Craven. As early as 1582 a Kirkby Malhamdale man had been presented before the northern court of high commission for misbehaving during one of his sermons, &#145;sayinge that it was a shame for him to tarry so longe in the pulpytt&#146;  (Marchant, 278). Ten years later, in 1592, records of a case of defamation brought before the same court reveal him as a participant in &#145;exercises&#146; at Gargrave. In 1594 Shute himself became a member of high commission, yet the same year was presented for not using the cross in baptism and then, following his compliance on this point, for other nonconformist practices. However, such trouble as he experienced over the affair seems to have arisen from a quarrel with some parishioners: that he remained a commissioner and that the court's sole requirement was that he should preach a sermon approving the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> is testimony both to the strength of puritanism and its patrons in the area and to the authorities' perception of the imperative for providing an effective preaching and pastoral ministry. In 1599 Shute was nominated a member of the commission for the investigation of schism in the northern province.<br>
<br>By the end of the century Shute was acting as the chairman of the governors of Giggleswick School, and in that capacity he began in 1599 to keep minutes of their meetings, preserved at the school in the &#145;Shute book&#146;. At least three of his sons were pupils there, and between 1615 and 1619, probably as a temporary expedient, Shute also served as headmaster. He died at Giggleswick shortly after making his will on 9 October 1626, and was buried there on 14 October. His wife survived him, but was dead by 1 May 1628, when her will was proved.<br>
<br>All five of Shute's sons entered the ministry, a fact noted and celebrated by David Lloyd in his memoir of Josias. Robert, of whom little is known, was vicar of Lyn and predeceased his father. <a name="cosubject_74238"></a><span class="headword">Nathaniel Shute</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1587, <em>d.</em> 1638)<span class="occ"></span>, who graduated BA from Christ's College, Cambridge, early in 1604 and proceeded MA in 1607, was rector of St Margaret Moyses, London, from 24 February 1614 to 1618, and of St Mildred Poultry from 23 January 1618. Described by Lloyd as &#145;an excellent scholar and solid preacher&#146;  (p. 295), he published only <span class="italic">Corona charitatis: the Crown of Charity</span> (1626), a funeral sermon for his friend Richard Fishburne, merchant, preached at the Mercers' chapel on 10 May 1625. Shute died in 1638 and was buried on 11 August, his funeral sermon being preached by Richard Holdsworth; admonition of his will was granted on 24 September to his son Christopher.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_74239"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Shute</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1590, <em>d.</em> 1618<span class="mult">x</span>26)<span class="occ"></span> matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1605, graduated BA from Peterhouse in 1609, was ordained deacon and priest in Chester on 17 February 1611, and proceeded MA in 1612. He became domestic chaplain to Bishop George Lloyd of Chester and preached his funeral sermon in 1615. He was still a preacher in the city in 1618 but dead by the time his father made his will in October 1626. <a name="cosubject_74240"></a><span class="headword">Timothy Shute</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1592, <em>d.</em> in or before 1659)<span class="occ"></span> matriculated from Peterhouse, Cambridge, in the Easter term of 1609, graduated BA in 1613, and proceeded MA in 1616. It was almost certainly he who married Precilla Spackman on 21 October 1619 at St Nicholas Cole Abbey, London; their son Christopher was baptized there on 28 November 1623, but was not among the three sons and three daughters of the marriage named in Shute's will, dated 1645. Timothy was rector of Holy Trinity, Exeter, from 1628 and a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral from 1630. On 6 October 1636 he married at St Thomas the Apostle, Exeter, Joane or Jane Moore, a widow with two sons. According to John Walker, on his refusal to take the covenant Timothy Shute was ejected from his Exeter livings in 1645 and disqualified from holding others, but in 1645 and 1647 he appears as rector of Lawhitton, Cornwall, and in 1650 as rector of Farway, where on 8 January 1655 he or his son was admitted by the triers. The date of his death is unknown. In his will he left, among many other bequests, works by George Downame, Richard Holdsworth, and Aquinas; notes he and his brother Josias had compiled went to his sons Thomas and Timothy, who were destined for the ministry. They proved the will on 24 February 1659.<br>
