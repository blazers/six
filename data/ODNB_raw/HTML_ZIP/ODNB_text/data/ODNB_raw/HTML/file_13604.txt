<span class="headword">Holmes,  William</span>  (1689&#150;1748), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in the parish of St Swithin London Stone on 5 April 1689, the son of Thomas and Margaret Holmes of London. He was admitted into Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 12 September 1701 and was elected to St John's College, Oxford, on 11 June 1707, whence he matriculated on 2 July. He was admitted fellow in 1710, graduated BA on 16 May 1711, and proceeded MA on 9 April 1715. After filling the office of proctor in 1721 he took the degree of BD on 13 April 1722 and that of DD on 5 March 1725. He held in succession the livings of North Leigh, near Oxford (1725&#150;6), and of Henbury, Gloucestershire (1726&#150;8), and was elected president of St John's College on 3 June 1728. On 24 September he was appointed rector of Boxwell, Gloucestershire, and to the college living of Hanborough, Oxfordshire. From 1731 to 1737 he was proctor for the clergy of the diocese of Oxford in convocation.<br>
<br>From 1732 to 1735 Holmes was vice-chancellor of Oxford University and, as such, was appealed to by John Wesley to allay the fears of critics of the Holy Club. In 1734 he was appointed one of the king's chaplains. In the same year, as vice-chancellor, he presented addresses from the university on the occasion of the marriage of the princess royal to the prince of Orange, who during his time at Oxford had been partly under Holmes's care. From 1736 to 1742 Holmes was an energetic regius professor of history. As president of St John's he had printed, so that it might be given to every scholar on entry, the last letter of Sir Thomas White, founder of the college, in which he urges the fellows to live at peace with each other and bids them &#145;take a coppye of yt for my sake&#146;. Holmes is ridiculed as time-serving in an imitation of the first satire of Juvenal, printed in London in 1740, and in a letter purporting to be written from Oxford and published in <span class="italic">British Champions, or, The Impartial Advertizer</span> (10 January 1743); &#145;that ornament of learning and politeness H&#151;es&#146; is given as an example of those who &#145;steer judiciously between all extremes&#146;. He was certainly the first president to be loyal to the house of Hanover. He seems to have supported sound learning and was civil to Thomas Hearne, the antiquary, who wished to see a plan adopted for printing Oxford manuscripts. While vice-chancellor Holmes revived, on 9 July 1733, the ceremony of &#145;the act&#146;, which had been discontinued, and invited Handel to play before and after the ceremony. He offended Hearne and probably other traditionalists, however, by allowing Handel to perform on his own account in the Sheldonian Theatre on several occasions and to charge 5<i>s</i>. for admission; Hearne refers scathingly to &#145;Handel and (his lousy crew) a great number of foreign fiddlers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae</span>, 778). On the other hand Holmes prohibited a company of players from visiting Oxford. On 4 June 1742 he was nominated by the crown to the deanery of Exeter. Two months earlier, on 15 March, he had married Sarah England, widow of Robert England, at St Sepulchre's, London.<br>
<br>The only work ascribed to Holmes is <span class="italic">The Country Parson's Advice to his Parishioners &hellip; of the Younger Sort</span>, published anonymously in 1742; other editions, with slightly different titles, were published in 1764, 1769, and 1783. Holmes died on 4 April 1748, at the age of fifty-eight, leaving considerable property (two farms and &pound;200 a year) to St John's College, and was buried in the college chapel. He was survived by his wife, Sarah; she died on 3 December 1750. She was also a benefactor to the college, where her portrait still hangs, in St Giles's House. A monument was erected to Holmes in the college chapel, at her direction.<br>
