<span class="headword">Festing, Sir  Francis Worgan</span>  (1833&#150;1886), <span class="occ">Royal Marines officer</span>, second son of Captain Benjamin Morton Festing RN, and Caroline Jane, only daughter of F. B. Wright of Hinton Blewett, Somerset, was born at High Littleton, Somerset, on 24 July 1833. He was educated at the Royal Naval College, New Cross, and at sixteen entered the Royal Marines as a cadet, being gazetted second lieutenant on 3 July 1850. In 1854 he served with the Baltic expedition. He commanded a mortar in the flotilla used against Sevastopol from June 1855 until its fall, and was also at the bombardment and surrender of Kinburn. For these services he received a medal with clasp, and was made a knight of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. He saw service with the China expedition 1857&#150;9 as adjutant of the artillery, when he assisted in the blockade of the Canton River and in the bombardment and storming of the city, and was rewarded with his brevet of major. In 1862 he married Margaret Elizabeth, daughter of A. Hall of Watergate, Sussex; she died in June 1864. In 1869 he married Charlotte Letitia, daughter of R. J. Todd; she died in 1871.<br>
<br>Festing served throughout the Second Anglo-Asante War during 1873&#150;4, and when the Asante army under Amanquatia threatened Cape Coast Castle, he was selected to command the detachment of marines sent to the Gold Coast in May 1873 to assist in repelling the Asante army, which was then encamped at Mampom, between Abrakampa and the River Pra. The chiefs of Ehina were asked to lay down their arms, and on their refusal their town was attacked on 13 June. Festing commanded the forces in the engagements that day, when the enemy were defeated and their town burnt. On the arrival of Sir Garnet Wolseley, Festing was placed in command at Cape Coast. He was taken on Wolseley's list of special service officers on 20 October, and took the command of the indigenous camp at Dunkwa and of the advanced posts. He commanded the forces at the engagements near Dunkwa on 27 October, when he was slightly wounded, and on 3 November, when he was severely wounded while trying to rescue Lieutenant Eardley Wilmot of the Royal Artillery, who had fallen mortally wounded. He was afterwards placed in charge of the camp at Prahsu.<br>
<br>Festing held a dormant commission to administer the government of the Gold Coast while commanding the regular troops, and was on the executive council. He was specially allowed to retain the rank of colonel (brevet colonel, 7 January 1874) in the army for his distinguished services, and was made CB on 31 March 1874 and KCMG on 8 May 1874, and received the thanks of parliament. He was appointed assistant adjutant-general of the Royal Marines in August 1876, made an aide-de-camp to the queen on 7 July 1879, and gazetted colonel commandant of the Royal Marine Artillery on 3 September 1886. In 1876 he had married Selina Eleanor Mary, only daughter of Leycester William Carbonell; she survived her husband. He died at his home, Donnington Lodge, Newbury, on 21 November 1886, and was buried at Eastney cemetery, Portsmouth, on 26 November.<br>
