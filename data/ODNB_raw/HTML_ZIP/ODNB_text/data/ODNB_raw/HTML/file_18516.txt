<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Meikle,  Andrew</span>  (1719&#150;1811), <span class="occ">millwright and inventor of the threshing machine</span>, was born on 5 May 1719, probably at Saltoun, Haddingtonshire. He was one of at least two brothers. His father, James Meikle, wright in Nether Keith, Haddingtonshire, working on behalf of Henry Fletcher, brother of Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, visited the Netherlands in 1710 and brought back knowledge of pot barley making.<br>
<br>Between the late 1740s and late 1760s Meikle worked on a number of projects, mostly textile mills, with his brother, Robert (<i>d</i>. 1780), whose surname was sometimes rendered Mackell. In 1751 they were appointed as consultants to the board of trustees for manufactures, who allowed them &pound;20 per annum to train apprentices and in 1754 granted them a premium for improvements to bleaching machinery. They surveyed mills for the forfeited estates commission and in 1768 obtained a patent (no. 896) for a grain winnowing machine. In 1772 Andrew Meikle took out a second patent, for spring-regulated windmill sails. In addition to Scottish projects and commissions, his work took him to the north of England, East Anglia, and London.<br>
<br>By the early 1750s Meikle had settled at Houston Mill, near East Linton on the Haddingtonshire Tyne. John Rennie, the engineer, lived at the nearby farm of Phantassie and spent two years working with Meikle in the early 1770s before completing his formal education. From about 1780 onwards, Meikle was also associated with Knowes Mill, a mile or so further downstream.<br>
<br>Meikle was married to Marjorie Mirrilees, who predeceased him. They are known to have had at least eight children. Of these, James (the eldest, <i>d</i>. before 1807), Andrew (1760&#150;1839), Mary, and Marion remained in Haddingtonshire; <a href="#cosubject_18517">George [<i>see below</i>]</a> followed his father's trade and was best-known as the inventor in 1787 of an ingenious water-lifting wheel, which was used to float peats from Blairdrummond Moss, Perthshire; Robert and John lived and worked in the West Indies, at Berbice, Demerara, and Grenada, where John was reputed to have made a considerable fortune from building sugar mills; and another son, David, died at Houston Mill before he could make the passage to Grenada.<br>
<br>Meikle's work on the threshing machine first comes to light with a machine for threshing grain and &#145;scutching&#146; (that is, beating) flax, and which consisted of five flails driven by a water-wheel at Knowes Mill. A demonstration on 14 February 1788 impressed a number of Haddingtonshire gentlemen, who drew it to the attention of the board of trustees for manufactures. Meikle did not persist with this design, but instead worked on machines based on a revolving drum, which had originated in Northumberland in the early 1770s and had been brought to Scotland in model form by Sir Francis Kinloch of Gilmerton. Kinloch sent a model, incorporating his own improvements, to Meikle, who tested it to destruction at Houston Mill in 1784. When in 1785 Meikle worked on a new design, this incorporated a revolving drum.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_18517"></a><span class="headword">George Meikle</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1811)<span class="occ"></span>, working from Alloa, Clackmannanshire, almost certainly knew of another early design, initiated by Michael Stirling, farmer at Craighead, Dunblane, in 1748 or 1758. This machine had revolving wooden &#145;scutchers&#146; (beaters) of a type already used in flax-preparing lint mills. Meikle's prototype machine, erected at Knowes Mill, used short scutchers mounted on a revolving drum. When in 1786 George Meikle installed the first complete machine for James Stein at Kilbagie, Clackmannanshire, he added a pair of fluted feed-rollers, another feature of lint mills. The patent (no. 1645), granted to Andrew and George Meikle in 1788, incorporated all of these elements, but could not apply in Scotland as the machine had already been publicly used there.<br>
<br>The patent proved troublesome. There were competing claims from proponents of the Northumbrian and Dunblane machines and from Sir Francis Kinloch. During the first ten years so many unlicensed machines were erected that attempts to enforce the patent were abandoned. In 1809 Sir John Sinclair established a subscription fund which raised &pound;1500 on Andrew Meikle's behalf. Andrew Meikle died on 27 November 1811 at Houston Mill, near East Linton, and was buried at the kirk of Prestonkirk, East Linton, where there is a tombstone to his memory. His son George died just two days later.<br>
