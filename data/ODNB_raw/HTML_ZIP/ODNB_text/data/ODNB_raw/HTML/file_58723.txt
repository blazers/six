<span class="headword">Grueber,  Francis</span>  (1658?&#150;1730), <span class="occ">gunpowder and leather manufacturer and merchant</span>, was born in Lyons, France, probably in December 1658, the eldest of the three sons and three daughters of Daniel Grueber (<i>d</i>. 1692) and his wife, Susanne (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Monginot). The Huguenot family arrived in England about 1680 and, as distressed protestants, were endenizened in November 1682 and subsequently naturalized by act of parliament in June 1685. Daniel Grueber remained domiciled in the London parish of St Swithin, and a member of the capital's French Walloon community, until his death in 1692, but by 1687 he had rented leather and gunpowder mills in the parishes of Ospringe, Preston, and Faversham in Kent, and was involved in a regular coastal trade, exporting grouph petre and general groceries to Faversham, and importing the gunpowder and skins manufactured in his mills by return.<br>
<br>After Daniel's death Francis and his youngest brother, Nicholas, inherited their father's lease on the gunpowder and leather mills (on a two-thirds to one-third ratio respectively). Nicholas appears soon to have surrendered his share, and by the mid-1690s Francis had emerged as the largest of five Faversham merchants supplying gunpowder to the Ordnance Office. In 1699, for example, Francis Grueber alone was responsible for 1337 of the 2692 barrels of gunpowder shipped coastwise from Faversham. Refined saltpetre also featured prominently in consignments to the capital under his name. Grueber's export of sheep and deer skins to the metropolis was likewise substantial in the 1690s, and he also dabbled occasionally in the grain trade that dominated the business of the port of Faversham. After 1700, however, Grueber seems to have concentrated increasingly on gunpowder manufacture, his mills providing employment for others among the small community of Huguenot refugees who had also settled in Faversham by the turn of the century. Before 1690 he had married Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1738), with whom he had two daughters and three sons. Between 1691 and 1693 he was a deacon of the French church in Threadneedle Street, London, and was an elder between 1705 and 1708 and after 1713.<br>
<br>The risks inherent in gunpowder manufacture were not always neutralized by Huguenot technical expertise. In September 1703 one of Grueber's Faversham mills exploded spectacularly. As Daniel Defoe later recalled:<blockquote>The blast was not only frightful, but it shattered the whole town, broke the windows, blew down chimneys, and gable-ends not a few &hellip; but what was most remarkable in it all, was, that the eldest son of the master of the powder-mill, a youth of about fifteen years of age, who was not in the mill, or near it, when it blew up: but in a boat upon the river, rowing cross for his diversion, was kill'd by a piece of the building of the mill, which blew up in the air by the force of the powder, and fell down upon him in the boat. (Defoe, 112)</blockquote>Francis Grueber the younger (1691&#150;1703) was buried on 15 September, along with three Huguenot powdermakers who had been directly blown up at work &#145;by the store of fried-up powder&#146;  (CKS, TR 1042/11/7). In October 1703 Faversham corporation somewhat belatedly ordered the purchase of &#145;a dozen leather buckets &hellip; for the extinguishing of fire which at any time might happen&#146;, and that the &#145;engine belonging to this town be put in good and sufficient repair &hellip; that it may be fit to extinguish any fire&#146;  (CKS, Fa/AC 4, pt ii, fol. 255<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>The acknowledged urban gentry status of the family notwithstanding, disputes centring on production and working practices at the gunpowder mills meant that relations between the Gruebers and Faversham corporation were often strained in later years. In 1728 Grueber was reportedly facing bankruptcy, at which point he entered into a partnership with Thomas Coram, the merchant, American colonist, and later founder of the Foundling Hospital, London. Following his death on 15 April 1730 Francis Grueber, &#145;gentleman&#146;, was buried in Faversham parish church on 19 April; he was survived by his wife, who was buried in the church on 21 December 1738. After his death the business passed to his surviving son, (Henry) Francis (<i>d</i>. 1747). In April 1741 this Francis Grueber was censured by the corporation for dangerously transporting loose gunpowder through the town, but by then his business was in trouble, and within two or three years the day-to-day management of local powder mills had fallen entirely into different hands. Faversham's principal gunpowder mill was eventually purchased by the Ordnance Board in 1759.<br>
