<span class="headword">Mandeville,  John Henry</span>  (1773&#150;1861), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born in Suffolk. After attending Dedham School he entered the navy, but later held a commission in the 1st light dragoons. On 16 September 1797 he married Mary Serle (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1818), with whom he had a son, who predeceased him. For over twenty years, from 1801, he held unpaid posts as an attach&eacute; in the diplomatic service: in the summer of 1801 he was commissary for prisoners of war in France, and was from 1802 to 1804 attached to the embassy at Paris, before moving to Vienna in 1804, Brussels in 1815, and Frankfurt in 1817. He became paid attach&eacute; at Paris in 1824, and was appointed secretary to the embassy at Lisbon in 1828 and secretary at Constantinople, where from 1831 to 1833 he was minister plenipotentiary. He was &#145;considered by his superiors active, trustworthy, and intelligent&#146; and has been seen as a &#145;typical workhorse&#146; of the British diplomatic service  (Jones, 19).<br>
<br>In October 1835 Mandeville was named minister plenipotentiary at Buenos Aires, replacing Charles James Hamilton (1779&#150;1856). He arrived there on 3 May 1836, and occupied an important role in diplomatic, political, and military affairs during his period of office, which coincided with the dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas. In May 1839 he negotiated a treaty with Rosas's foreign minister, Felipe Ara&ntilde;a, by which slave traders were to be regarded as pirates. He developed close relations with Rosas (despite the fact that the dictator treated him with a certain mockery) and his daughter, Manuelita, at whose soir&eacute;es and entertainments he was a frequent visitor. A cultured man with an intriguing personality, physically small, bald, and with tiny, penetrating eyes, he was dashing in both his attire and his social life, a well-known figure in political circles, at the theatre, and in the social events of Buenos Aires, where he resided in the Parque Lezama district. While under no illusions about Rosas's despotism, Mandeville viewed him as pro-British, and committed to upholding the treaty of friendship signed in 1825. He also saw Rosas as an important source of stability in Argentina, British residents and property being vulnerable to any breakdown in order. Mandeville was criticized, however, for being too slow to condemn the killings of Rosas's political opponents, though he made formal protests to the Argentinian leader in 1840 and 1842.<br>
<br>When British policy under the Conservative foreign secretary Lord Aberdeen became more hostile to Rosas, Mandeville was urged to develop closer relations with Uruguay, with whom in July 1839 he had concluded a treaty against the slave trade. In July 1842 he signed a treaty of friendship, trade, and navigation with the government of Fructuoso Rivera of Uruguay. He failed to halt the hostilities between Argentina and Uruguay, which led to Rosas's forces surrounding Montevideo, and an apparent promise by him of military aid in support of President Rivera was later repudiated by London. When, early in 1843, a British naval force under Commodore John Brett Purvis (1787&#150;1857) intervened on the River Plate to prevent the bombardment of Montevideo, Mandeville opposed more aggressive actions against the Argentinian blockade, fearing repercussions for the British community in Buenos Aires. He was replaced in May 1845 by William Gore Ouseley, and retired on a pension in August 1845.<br>
<br>Mandeville was a controversial figure. He was publicly criticized by British business interests in Montevideo for failing to support them in the face of Rosas's aggression, and for misleading them into believing that there would be military intervention. Privately, his successor, who opposed his policy towards Rosas, alleged that he had received favours from the dictator, and that the Mrs McDonald whom Mandeville presented at social occasions as his &#145;niece&#146; was in fact a mistress, who occupied a house provided by Rosas (Ouseley to Aberdeen, 23 July 1845, Lynch, 377 n. 75). Jos&eacute; M&aacute;rmol's novel of the dictatorship, <span class="italic">Amalia</span> (1851), depicted Mandeville as servile to Rosas. Yet there is no doubt that his complicated and often contradictory diplomatic role was highly beneficial to the British residents of Buenos Aires, who were a very privileged group during that period. In retirement he continued to work on the River Plate question and travelled to Paris, where he had an audience with King Louis Philippe and Guizot on 1 January 1847, when it was reported that he was preparing to travel to Buenos Aires to take charge of the peace talks with Rosas (this did not occur); in 1847 and 1848 he briefed Lord Howden and Henry Southern before they went as envoys to Buenos Aires. He died at his home, 11 Rutland Gate, London, on 16 March 1861.<br>
