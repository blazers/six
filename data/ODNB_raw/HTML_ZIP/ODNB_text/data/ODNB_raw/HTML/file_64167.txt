<span class="headword">Stone,  Thomas Brace</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> 1815), <span class="occ">agricultural writer and land surveyor</span>, was baptized at Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, on 26 November 1753, the fifth son of Richard Stone (<i>d</i>. 1782/3), and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Arnold, who died before her husband. Richard Stone was a prosperous draper and a churchwarden in Leighton Buzzard, and the owner of considerable property there and in neighbouring Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Thomas Stone is known to have lived for many years in the East Indies. Confirmation comes from his letter of July 1776 to Governor-General Warren Hastings. This, from Pondicherry, acknowledges his &#145;distressful situation &hellip; occasioned by folly and indiscretion&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29137, fol. 283). He had been based in Calcutta but had been forced to escape his creditors there by fleeing to a place then safely under French control. Whether his appeal for help to Hastings was answered is unknown, but he soon returned to England. He now started farming in &#145;the Eastern part of Norfolk, where I was bred up a farmer&#146;  (T. B. Stone, <span class="italic">General View of the Agriculture of the County of Lincoln</span>, 1794, 86). He next moved to Tong, Shropshire, where he farmed 1300 acres and met John Bishton sen. (1735&#150;1806) of Kilsall, who was to write the <span class="italic">General View of the Agriculture of the County of Salop</span> for the board of agriculture, published in 1794.<br>
<br>After inheriting property from his father in 1783 Stone moved on to land surveying and valuing estates. He settled in Bedford, where his first book was produced, <span class="italic">Essay on Agriculture</span>, 1785, dedicated to the Norfolk MP Harbord Harbord, whose Norfolk land agent had been fellow agriculturist William Marshall. Despite castigation by the eminent agricultural reformer Arthur Young, the <span class="italic">Essay</span> &#145;contrived to lead many persons of distinction to believe that he possessed superior talents in the management of estates&#146;  (Shoberl, 447). Stone married Mary Purser at Ampthill on 21 November 1786 and then became active as an estate manager in Bedfordshire, where he was principal acting manager for the duke of Bedford's estates from 1794, and in Lincolnshire, where he valued Sir Joseph Banks's 3400 acre estate in 1796. His work for both, which involved his partner Charles Chadwick Cremer (<i>c</i>.1765&#150;1818), was soon criticized as overpriced and inaccurate. Stone was also a commissioner for some Bedfordshire inclosures (on which he published a pamphlet in 1787) and roads.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Stone was asked by Sir John Sinclair, whose inconsiderate manner in choosing his authors so riled Young, to write reports for his board of agriculture. Late in 1793 (when Stone had opened a Gray's Inn office in London) his <span class="italic">Agriculture of Huntingdon</span> was published, followed by those for Lincolnshire (February 1794) and Bedfordshire (July 1794). These were welcomed by his friend Marshall, but not by his new enemy Young. In 1796 the board of agriculture asked its contributors to prepare improved reports on their counties but immediately realized that, in its new financial plight, it would be unable to support them. Stone was certainly asked to prepare an improved report for Bedfordshire in May 1796, an invitation rescinded in June. Stone felt bitter, especially when in June 1797 Young (secretary to the board) was asked to prepare the new report on Lincolnshire. Stone now made himself obnoxious to the board by continual demands for compensation between 1797 and 1799. He had leased Ampthill House by mid-1797, thereby probably overextending himself financially.<br>
<br>Young's new report on Lincolnshire was published in 1799 and Stone took immediate revenge in the long and vicious <span class="italic">A Review of the Corrected Agricultural Survey of Lincolnshire</span>, published in 1800, in which Young was called &#145;the worst farmer in Suffolk&#146;  (p. 21), together with a printed <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Somerville</span> (the board's new president) &#145;with a view to shew the inutility of the plans and researches of that institution&#146; published that same year, in which he, probably with Marshall, joined forces as a Society of Practical Farmers. Stone had by now been appointed a commissioner for draining the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire. His two last published works were <span class="italic">Letters on Drainage in Lincolnshire</span> (a scheme being proposed by John Rennie sen.), published in 1800 and 1801 (of the latter no surviving copy is known).<br>
<br>Francis Russell, fifth duke of Bedford, who had been disputing Stone's charges between 1796 and 1798, decided to take his own revenge in 1800 and arraigned Stone, who &#145;combined such a love of rural sports, and of convivial enjoyments, as interfered with his business&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>), before the local magistrates for killing game on estates at Maulden without a licence. Stone immediately countered with the same charge against two of the duke's employees. The Bedfordshire magistrates found Stone guilty in January 1801 but he appealed to the court of king's bench in London, whose four judges, in June, were split in their legal opinion, so failing to confirm or deny his conviction.<br>
<br>By now Stone was clearly again in deep financial difficulty. He had written in 1796 of having &#145;lain under a Cloud of Obloquy for many years&#146;  (Bedfordshire RO, R3/2009) and by July 1801 had been seized for rent and ejected from Ampthill House. He is last heard of in England in September 1801 at Wansford, near Peterborough, probably busy with drainage work. By October 1801 the legal case against him had been discontinued, probably because he had already &#145;suddenly eloped with twelve thousand pounds belonging to one of his noble employers [surely the duke of Bedford] and various smaller sums&#146;  (Shoberl, 447). Bedford died suddenly in March 1802 leaving unsettled accounts of &pound;400,000 and when irregularities were found in these, his steward at Woburn, John Farey, was summarily dismissed by the sixth duke, Farey later writing, in 1813, of Stone's &#145;merited exile and oblivion&#146;  (Farey, 375). Stone had certainly emigrated again to French protection by the time of the peace of Amiens in May 1802. There he died in poverty in Paris in October 1815, much attacked by gout, leaving his wife and daughters in real difficulty.<br>
