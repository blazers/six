<span class="headword">Dillon,  John</span>  (1851&#150;1927), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born into the Catholic bourgeoisie in Blackrock, co. Dublin, on 4 September 1851, second son among eight children of the Young Irelander <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7657/', "John Blake Dillon (1814&#150;1866)")</script> and Adelaide (1828&#150;1872), daughter of William Hart, a Dublin solicitor.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareersummary"></a>Early life and career summary</h2>John Dillon was educated privately (one of his tutors was the Fenian James Stephens) and at the age of thirteen was sent to Dr Quinn's school in Harcourt Street. From 1865 to 1870 he studied in the arts faculty of the Catholic University, where he won several prizes and was auditor of the Literary and Historical Society. A voracious reader, he devoured works on literature, history, philosophy, medicine, and science, among many topics. In 1870 Dillon briefly was apprenticed to a Manchester cotton broker but he returned to Dublin and began studies at the Catholic University medical school, before becoming a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1875. Dillon then was a demonstrator in anatomy at the Cecilia Street medical school, but ceased active involvement in medicine when he entered political life. Family financial means enabled him to devote his energies exclusively to politics. A romantic revolutionary aura hung over this tall (6 feet 2 inches), thin man, who was plagued by chronic bouts of illness, including dyspepsia (a condition that affected him in every political crisis), varicose veins, a degree of heart trouble, and eye problems&#151;although he was also prone to hypochondria.<br>
<br>Dillon's liberal, independent Irish Catholic notion of an inclusive political nation based on civic rights was in consonance with his father's vision. He articulated radical&#150;Liberal opinions: C. P. Scott observed, &#145;on social subjects and in foreign politics he is a keen and active Liberal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Diaries of C. P. Scott</span>, 202), though in later years he was essentially conservative on labour questions and women's suffrage. Dillon&#151;solitary, aloof, fastidious, and lacking in bonhomie&#151;was respected in Ireland and by the House of Commons. At the height of the land war, when he was locked in political combat with the government, the Irish chief secretary's adopted daughter none the less recorded, &#145;there is always something impressive in Mr Dillon's tragical face and manner, and belief in his undoubted honesty and political unselfishness never fail to get him a respectful hearing from the House&#146;  (<span class="italic">Florence Arnold-Forster's Irish Journal</span>, 494). Yet he also had a vindictive streak that manifested itself later in his attitude to Sir Horace Plunkett, Sir Antony MacDonnell, James Larkin, and James Connolly. Possibly he had more of a Catholic concept of the &#145;nation&#146; than he would have wished to acknowledge; Dillon was unwilling to accommodate the Irish landlord class. His public career falls into three phases: radical and agrarian up to 1891; party and parliamentary leader from 1891 to 1914; and an increasingly critical though constitutional opponent of Britain and its Irish policy from 1914 to 1918.<h2>
<a name="RadicalandagrariantheHomeRuleLeagueandtheLandLeague"></a>Radical and agrarian: the Home Rule League and the Land League</h2>Dillon joined the Home Rule League when it was founded in November 1873. He surfaced in the parliamentary by-election campaign of John Mitchel, his father's old associate, for Tipperary in 1875, when he first met William O'Brien, for many years his closest colleague and later an unrelenting critic. Dillon became ill in 1876 and remained largely outside the political arena until the next year, when he was elected to the council of the Home Rule League and began working with Charles Stewart Parnell. He also joined the council of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language and later the Gaelic League, though he never succeeded in learning Irish himself. A political rather than a cultural nationalist, he was a foremost opponent of making Irish a compulsory subject in the new National University in February 1909. From the time he entered politics until the early 1890s he was seen as a radical with an affinity for Fenianism, though he never joined the movement. By attacking the supposedly anaemic parliamentary approach of Isaac Butt in January 1878 Dillon won public notice; on 4 February 1879 he famously condemned the ailing Butt on the leader's last appearance at the Home Rule League council in Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1879 Dillon made his first speech on the land question and on 5 October he advocated what would become known as &#145;boycotting&#146;. When the Irish National Land League was formed in October 1879, he was a member of the original committee and accompanied Parnell on a mission to North America to raise funds for the new body; he remained there until July. In April 1880 he joined the executive of the league. Though Dillon admired Parnell, the two were never intimate colleagues. In his absence Dillon was returned to the House of Commons for Tipperary at the general election in April. But his principal forum was Land League meetings; on 5 November he was among those unsuccessfully prosecuted for conspiracy to prevent the payment of rent. Dillon was a close ally and friend of Michael Davitt, the spearhead of the land agitation. In January he was elected to the committee of the party and, after Davitt's imprisonment, he was appointed Land League head of organization on 13 February. A stern critic of Gladstone's <span class="roman">Land Bill</span> introduced in April 1881, which he believed would do nothing for small farmers, Dillon stole a march on Parnell by calling for its rejection (12 April). No other member of the Irish party ever took the initiative away from Parnell in that period. Dillon was detained under the <span class="roman">Protection of Person and Property Act</span> (1881) on 2 May (ultimately he was imprisoned six times) but his health quickly deteriorated and he was released on 6 August. At that time he declined to be associated with Parnell's newly launched newspaper, <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>. On 15 October he was incarcerated again, with Parnell and others, in Kilmainham prison. Although opposed to the &#145;No rent manifesto&#146; issued on 18 October, as a gesture of solidarity Dillon signed it. Shortly after his release from prison on 2 May he (and Parnell) received the freedom of Dublin (16 August). As part of the &#145;Kilmainham treaty&#146;, Parnell sought to end the land war; unhappy with this change of direction, on 25 September Dillon announced his withdrawal from politics &#145;for the next few years&#146;  (Moody, 539); he left Ireland in November and in the summer of 1883 departed for Colorado, where his elder brother, William, lived. There he avoided politics and did not mix with Irish-Americans.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1885 Dillon re-emerged tentatively in politics, after returning home to find the political climate altered. Though he had differed from Parnell over cessation of the land war, he now believed that the Irish leader's strategy on home rule had borne fruit. Persuaded to contest the Ulster seat of North Tyrone, where he was narrowly defeated in the autumn general election, Dillon also was selected to fight the safe constituency of East Mayo, which he held until 1918. When Parnell, at the risk of undermining party unity, insisted on the selection of Captain William O'Shea for the parliamentary vacancy at Galway borough in February 1886, Dillon remained neutral. Gladstone's adoption of home rule in 1886 confirmed Dillon's acceptance of Parnell's strategy and convinced him of the utility of the Liberal alliance. But the Conservatives' return to office in July 1886 heralded renewal of the land agitation and the following years were dominated by the second phase of the land struggle, the Plan of Campaign, which Dillon authored with O'Brien and T. C. Harrington; it was published on 23 October in <span class="italic">United Ireland</span>. He and O'Brien were the most visible leaders of the agitation. During 1887 he first met his future wife, Elizabeth Mathew [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55179/', "Dillon, Elizabeth (1865&#150;1907)")</script>], daughter of Sir James Mathew, at her parents' home in London, where he became a frequent guest. In the most notorious incident of the struggle on 9 September 1887 at Mitchelstown, Cork, where Dillon was speaking, the constabulary opened fire, killing three and wounding two. Although an earnest Catholic, Dillon always opposed clerical interference in secular politics; following the papal rescript condemning the Plan of Campaign, Dillon on 4 May 1888 retorted, &#145;that document is not binding on the conscience of any Irishman at all&#146;  (C. C. O'Brien, 221). From this period he faced a stream of criticism from some ecclesiastics, and notably engaged in a long-running dispute with the bishop of Limerick. Confined to Dundalk prison on 20 June, Dillon was released on 15 September because of weakening health. The Plan of Campaign was chronically bereft of funds and Parnell was not prepared to lend more than token aid. On 6 March 1889 Dillon sailed for Australia to solicit contributions; he also toured New Zealand, and returned to Ireland via the United States in late April 1890. His mission raised about &pound;33,000, but the financial woes of the plan persisted and the movement was nearly bankrupt by mid-1890. Dillon was arrested again on 18 September 1890, but received bail, and he and O'Brien disappeared on 9 October and travelled to America. He was thus abroad and unable to re-enter the United Kingdom during the crucial stages of the Parnell divorce crisis. After initial hesitation he declared against Parnell's continued leadership. He reached France on 18 January 1891 to join O'Brien in the &#145;Boulogne negotiations&#146; with Parnell over the leadership of the party. When these broke down, Dillon and O'Brien travelled on 12 February to Folkestone, where they were immediately arrested. They were detained in Galway gaol until 30 July, in what proved to be his final spell in prison. While interned, Dillon and O'Brien became increasingly disgusted with the tenor of Irish politics, especially by T. M. Healy's venomous attacks on Parnell. On their release they sided with the anti-Parnellites.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarymanoeuvrings18911914"></a>Parliamentary manoeuvrings, 1891&#150;1914</h2>Parnell's death marked the emergence of the second phase of Dillon's career. Although he never lost sight of the land question, especially the fate of evicted tenants, he increasingly focused on the management of the anti-Parnellites and the home rule question, though his active participation was limited by illness during later 1891 and early 1892. On his recovery he took the lead in resisting Healy's influence. As deputy to the aged Justin McCarthy, Dillon was effectively the anti-Parnellite chairman, and consolidated his pre-eminence by 1894. He worked to reconstruct Parnell's authority, with its emphases on united control, strong leadership, vigorous discipline, the reassertion of the party in the national movement, and on placing the constituencies in a subordinate position to the parliamentarians. When the Liberals reclaimed office in August 1892 Dillon was one of the Irish leaders routinely consulted about policy. He urged John Morley, the chief secretary, to treat the case of the evicted tenants and was party to the negotiations over the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> in 1893. Gladstone's retirement created a political vacuum in the Liberal alliance, presenting problems for Dillon's direction of the national agenda. Following the general election of 1895 the Conservatives returned to office, which limited nationalist influence, but the outcome of the election also provided Dillon with the ammunition to expel Healy from positions of influence in the movement. His personal circumstances changed when he married Elizabeth Mathew on 21 November at the Brompton Oratory. They had six children, five sons (born in 1896, 1898, 1900, 1902, and 1905) and a daughter (born in 1897). Their fourth son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65844/', "James Mathew Dillon (1902&#150;1986)")</script>.<br>
<br>On McCarthy's resignation, Dillon was elected chairman of the anti-Parnellites by thirty-eight votes to twenty-one on 18 February 1896. He immediately abolished the troublesome party committee but never enjoyed uncontested allegiance; the Healy faction and the <span class="italic">Irish Catholic</span> constantly snapped at his heels. At this point there were in reality three Irish national parties, though Dillon led much the largest. Dillon announced at the Irish Race Convention in September that he was ready to stand aside if this would abet reunion. However, he was less accommodating towards Sir Horace Plunkett's attempts to bring Unionists and nationalists together. Although he attended the All-Ireland Committee conference in 1896, Dillon never shed mistrust of dialogue with Irish Unionists, and displayed an animus against Plunkett, the co-operative movement, and Unionist reformism generally. Similarly, though he supported the <span class="roman">Irish Local Government Bill</span> (1898) sponsored by the tory government, he was uneasy about plums proffered from that quarter. In 1898 O'Brien initiated the United Irish League on an agrarian platform. Dillon was ambivalent about this new association, believing that it could lead to confrontation with the government and endanger the alliance with the Liberals. This time marked the first significant strains in the O'Brien&#150;Dillon relationship. In February 1899 Dillon resigned the party chairmanship in order to facilitate party reunion.<br>
<br>Freed from the constraints of leadership, Dillon felt able to take a more forthright political stance. He was a key critic of the South African War. Although faithfully supporting John Redmond after his selection for the chairmanship of the unified Irish party in February 1900, Dillon during late 1901 and early 1902 made a series of speeches on the land question. He went on a fund-raising tour of America in 1902 but became ill and was sidelined from politics from October until April 1903. During the interlude the land conference in December 1902 agreed a formula for tenant land purchase which became the backbone of the <span class="roman">Wyndham Act</span> (1903), the single largest measure of its type. Whereas O'Brien was a keen promoter of the accord and thereafter became the chief nationalist proponent of &#145;conference plus business&#146;, as the way to unite all classes and creeds for Ireland, Dillon's instinctive dislike of negotiations with landlords soon surfaced. While some of his objections to the act were well founded, at Swinford on 23 August he attacked the legislation and also the &#145;doctrine of conciliation&#146;  (Bew, <span class="italic">Conflict and Conciliation</span>, 102&#150;3), believing that the right approach was to put unrelenting pressure on the landlords and government. An ensuing breach with O'Brien was never healed; O'Brien's later published accounts severely tarnished Dillon's reputation. Dillon successfully urged Redmond to resist the conference approach to deal with the vexed question of universities in Ireland. Similarly, the devolution proposals promoted by the under-secretary, MacDonnell, were seen by Dillon as insidious. For much of 1904 he was once more afflicted by illness, and only resumed regular attendance in the House of Commons the next year.<br>
<br>When the Liberals returned to office in January 1906 Dillon again was regularly consulted. In 1906 he laboured assiduously to defend Catholic interests in the abortive <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> (for England and Wales) and was deeply involved in negotiations over the local government proposal of the chief secretary, James Bryce, which, however, he always disliked. A much modified scheme incorporating Dillon's major objections was proposed by Bryce's successor, Augustine Birrell, the next year. The nationalist response was uncertain; a national conference was called; this rejected the measure and it was withdrawn by the government. Dillon's part in the conference was curtailed abruptly when his wife died on 14 May; effectively he was inactive for some months afterwards. Subsequently, he spent most of his time in Dublin and raised a young family. The passage of the <span class="roman">Evicted Tenants Act</span> (1907), the <span class="roman">Irish University Act</span> (1908), and the <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> (1909) were more satisfying outcomes for Dillon. During the budget crisis of 1909 he spoke frequently in Ireland, incurring unpopularity for his stance on a measure which would increase the Irish tax burden.<br>
<br>Between 1910 and 1914 the home rule question re-emerged. Dillon twice suffered debilitating injuries during this period. From 4 June until October 1911 he was incapacitated and then in October 1912 he was thrown from a pony trap, which caused him to be inactive. During 1913 he was mostly in Ireland, casting an unsympathetic eye on the &#145;malignant enemy&#146;, James Larkin, during the Dublin &#145;lock-out&#146;  (Carroll, 208). Dillon was at the hub of negotiations over home rule in 1914, and was present at the abortive Buckingham Palace conference (21&#150;24 June). Opposed to &#145;partition&#146;, he was prepared to support local autonomy for northern protestant areas so long as the formal unity of the country was not compromised. During 1914 Dillon was frustrated by the government's handling of the &#145;Curragh mutiny&#146; (20&#150;25 March) and the fatal consequences of the use of troops at Bachelors Walk on 26 July.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstWorldWarreputation"></a>The First World War: reputation</h2>With the opening of the First World War, Dillon entered a final phase of his public career. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, Dillon accepted Redmond's support of the British decision to enter the conflict, though he never shared his leader's enthusiasm and he abstained from the military recruiting campaign. Between the Easter rising, April 1916, and the general election of 1918 Dillon's political statesmanship was severely tested. When the rebellion broke out he was in Dublin and able to estimate its effect. On 11 May he made an impassioned speech in the House of Commons against further executions. Thereafter Dillon, a natural pessimist, was plunged into constant gloom about the situation. He was immersed in David Lloyd George's abortive attempt to resolve the home rule question (May&#150;July 1916) and offered important criticisms of the government's actions in Ireland during the autumn. His reservations about the war accelerated, and he was &#145;deeply concerned &hellip; from the point of view especially of the protection of the smaller nationalities, and now of Rumania&#146;  (<span class="italic">Political Diaries of C. P. Scott</span>, 239). In 1917 he declined nomination to the Irish Convention. On 12 March 1918 Dillon was elected party chairman in succession to the recently deceased Redmond. He joined forces with Sinn F&eacute;in and the Catholic bishops in resisting the government's plan to introduce conscription to Ireland which, in the event, was never imposed. He made a further vain effort to persuade the government to introduce Irish self-government, introducing a motion for self-determination on 29 July 1918. After the failure to reach an electoral pact with Sinn F&eacute;in, the Irish party was overwhelmed by it in the December general election; Dillon himself was defeated in East Mayo by Eamon de Valera by 8975 votes to 4514.<br>
<br>Afterwards Dillon played little active part in Irish affairs, though he corresponded with old colleagues about public events. Between 1919 and 1922 he came to a rapprochement with his old antagonist Plunkett. Had Dillon left politics in 1882 or 1892, he would have been remembered as one of the foremost figures of the land struggle. As it is, his reputation was scarred by the long years of parliamentary manoeuvres after Parnell's fall and the failure to achieve home rule. Furthermore, his Young Ireland brand of nationalism seemed outmoded in the years after 1916, while his conservative views on labour and women did not endear him to a rising generation. His standing was also harmed in unflattering memoirs by several old colleagues. Following surgery, he died in a nursing home at Portland Place, London, on 4 August 1927, and was buried four days later in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin.<br>
