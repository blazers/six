<span class="headword">Humfrey,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1515&#150;1579), <span class="occ">mining promoter and assayer</span>, about whom nothing is known before 1560, was a central figure in the Elizabethan government's attempt to revitalize the country's mining and metallurgical industries. In 1560 Humfrey is known to have been a member of the Goldsmiths' Company and a resident of St Vedast's parish in the city of London. His involvement in national affairs owed much to the patronage of Sir William Cecil, with whom he corresponded regularly. Despite evidence to the contrary, Cecil continued to regard Humfrey as an expert on metallurgical matters and provided both financial backing and political support for his projects. In 1561 Humfrey was appointed assay master at the royal mint, where, in 1565, he was implicated in a robbery.<br>
<br>At the mint Humfrey came into contact with the German technologists who had been recruited to assist the recoinage. Both Humfrey and Cecil were convinced of the superiority of German metallurgical techniques, which they believed could be imported to develop new industries in England. In accordance with this policy, two joint-stock companies were incorporated under royal charter in 1568. The Mines Royal Company, which mined copper at Keswick, was financed by Augsburg bankers and operated by German technologists. The Company of Mineral and Battery Works, however, owed its origins to Humfrey's initiative in recruiting the Saxon, Christopher Sch&uuml;tz, to develop brass manufacture and battery in England. The company took over the patents that Humfrey and Sch&uuml;tz had obtained in 1565 covering the manufacture of brass, brass and iron wire, battery (the hammering of metal into plates and utensils), and the introduction of new mining and smelting technology.<br>
<br>Attempts to use German technology to stimulate English industries in this fashion failed. Although deposits of calamine (zinc ore) were discovered in Somerset, Sch&uuml;tz was unable to manufacture brass from English copper and zinc ores. Battery manufacture was similarly abandoned and the iron-wire mills erected at Tintern struggled to survive. In 1569 Humfrey, smarting from the company's criticism of his extravagant lifestyle at Tintern, leased back part of his original patents and turned his attention to the expanding lead industry.<br>
<br>About 1570 Humfrey and Sch&uuml;tz built a water-powered lead-smelting furnace at Beauchief, near Sheffield, and also introduced a German sieve for processing ore on the Derbyshire mines. Humfrey hoped to persuade the local smelters to adopt his new furnace under licence, but most preferred to retain their traditional wind-powered smelting boles. In response to Humfrey's initiative George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury, invited smelters from Somerset to erect a Mendip-ore hearth furnace in his park at Chatsworth. Humfrey complained to Burghley that this new furnace, which used foot-powered bellows, infringed his patent. Between 1581 and 1584 the court of exchequer set up four commissions to investigate this complaint and subsequent allegations.<br>
<br>Humfrey's furnace did make lead successfully, but only after he replaced his German workmen with a Mendip smelter. The water-powered smelting mill, as it came to be called, rapidly ousted both traditional boles and footblasts. Despite assistance from Burghley, Humfrey could stop neither the widespread adoption of the smelting mill by the local gentry nor the unlicensed use of his sieve by the miners. The new furnace consumed only half as much fuel as the bole and was far more convenient to operate. It enabled the industry to expand dramatically after 1570 when lead became a major export commodity. Humfrey did not live to see this development or the eventual failure of his patent action. When he died he had already lost interest in Derbyshire and had embarked upon a silver-mining project in Cardiganshire. Humfrey died intestate in July 1579 leaving a wife, Alice, and two daughters. Elizabeth, the elder daughter, married Robert Ledger, a merchant tailor, at St Vedast's on 30 July 1570; Alice, the younger, married Alexander Fownde, an embroiderer.<br>
