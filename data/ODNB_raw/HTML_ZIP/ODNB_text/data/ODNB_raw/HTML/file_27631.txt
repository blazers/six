<span class="headword">Townshend,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1845), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Richard Boyle Townshend, high sheriff for co. Cork and MP in the Irish House of Commons, and his wife, Henrietta, daughter of John Newenham of Maryborough. He was born at Castletownshend on 11 June 1789, and on 24 January 1805 was appointed cornet in the 14th light dragoons. He became lieutenant on 8 March 1806, by purchase, and captain on 6 June, without purchase. On 16 December 1808 he sailed from Falmouth with his regiment for Portugal. He served in the Peninsular War, in Portugal and Spain, from 1809 to 1813, and was repeatedly in action, serving at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo (December 1811 and January 1812) and Badajoz (March&#150;April 1812), and the battles of Salamanca (22 July 1812) and Vitoria (21 June 1813). On 24 June 1813 he took part in the taking of the enemy's last gun near Pamplona, under the command of Major Brotherton of the same regiment, and was constantly engaged with the enemy until the battle of Orthez on 27 February 1814. On 8 March he was made prisoner of war in an encounter with the enemy near the city of Pau, but was quickly released. He was subsequently present at the battle of New Orleans (8 January 1815).<br>
<br>Townshend was made: brevet major on 21 January 1819, as a reward for his services during the Peninsular War; major in the regiment, by purchase, on 13 September 1821; lieutenant-colonel, by purchase, on 16 April 1829; and aide-de-camp to the queen and colonel in the army on 23 November 1841. In 1827, on the death of his father, he succeeded to the family estates at Castletownshend. In 1831 he was one of the board of officers appointed by the general commanding in chief, under Lord Edward Somerset, for revising the formations and movements of cavalry. He served with his regiment in India for some years, but embarked at Bombay for England in November 1844. He landed in England in January 1845, and died unmarried at Castletownshend on 22 April 1845; he was buried there. A monument was erected to his memory in the church of Castletownshend by the officers of his regiment. He was succeeded in his estates by his brother, the Revd Maurice Fitzgerald Stephens-Townshend.<br>
