<span class="headword">Vettius Bolanus,  Marcus</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em><span class="smallcap">AD</span> 93), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, could well have been a descendant of a Marcus Bolanus for whom Cicero wrote a letter of recommendation as &#145;a good, brave, and in every respect distinguished man&#146;  (Cicero, <span class="italic">Ad familiares</span>, xiii.77). The rare name Bolanus is found, together with that of Vettius, on an inscription at Mediolanum (Milan), and other Bolani are recorded there and in this region of Italy, which was presumably the governor's home. The family also had estates in Etruria, north of Rome. Bolanus had two sons, one with the same names as himself, the other called Crispinus, born in the late <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 70s and <i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 80 respectively. Hence Bolanus evidently married late, as he himself was probably born between <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 20 and <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 30; he died <i>c</i>.<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 93.<br>
<br>Not much is known of his career before his governorship (<span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69&#150;71), but Bolanus served as a legionary legate in Armenia in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 62 in the campaign against the Parthians conducted by Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. He then probably served as proconsul of Macedonia before holding the consulship in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 66, or at least had strong links with that province, since a Macedonian who clearly owed his Roman citizenship to Bolanus, Marcus Vettius Philo, later left money in his will to celebrate Bolanus's birthday annually. In April <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69 Bolanus was at Lugdunum (Lyons), where he had gone to greet the emperor Vitellius immediately after the latter's generals had defeated Otho in northern Italy. The governor of Britain, Trebellius Maximus, had just arrived, having been forced out of the province: the legionary legates, dissatisfied with Trebellius's sluggish and indecisive stance during the civil war, had stirred up the troops against the governor's &#145;greed and meanness&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Histories</span>, i.60). Bolanus was selected to fill this difficult vacancy.<br>
<br>After a decade of inaction in the military field, there was now trouble on the northern frontier of the province. The Brigantes of the Pennines were at odds with their pro-Roman ruler Cartimandua, who was &#145;hated for her cruelty and lust&#146;, according to Tacitus  (<span class="italic">Histories</span>, iii.45): she had divorced her anti-Roman husband Venutius and married his armour bearer. An added incentive to the anti-Roman party was provided by the fall of Nero and the ensuing civil war, not least because Vitellius had further diminished the province's garrison (already deprived of the crack fourteenth legion and eight cohorts of Batavians in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 66) by withdrawing 8000 men from the other legions. Although Bolanus was allowed to take the fourteenth back to Britain, Vitellius soon demanded more troops. Bolanus temporized, because &#145;Britain was never peaceful enough&#146;  (ibid., ii.97); but substantial numbers of men from the British garrison were engaged in the civil war campaign in northern Italy in October <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69. Besides this, the loyalties of his men were again divided, between Vitellius and Vespasian, with the second legion favouring the latter, its old commander from twenty-five years earlier. Thus Bolanus's room for manoeuvre was already limited when the crisis in the north broke out. He was able to rescue Cartimandua and fought several battles with mixed success, according to Tacitus's account in the <span class="italic">Agricola</span>, written in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 98. But Venutius was left in control of the kingdom. Bolanus clearly had to refrain from further action until conditions were more favourable. At about this juncture, Julius Agricola took over command of the twentieth legion, replacing the turbulent Roscius Coelius, and fretted at his lack of opportunity for campaigning. Bolanus was replaced in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 71, by Petillius Cerialis, who, with the garrison back to full strength, was able to launch an aggressive, forward policy in northern Britain.<br>
<br>Shortly after his return from Britain, in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 73, Bolanus was honoured by Vespasian by being made a patrician and a little later became proconsul of Asia. Both items indicate that the man who had been appointed by Vespasian's enemy Vitellius had performed to the new emperor's satisfaction. Perhaps he had refused active support to Vitellius at a critical moment in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 69. Three years before Tacitus wrote about Bolanus for the first time in the <span class="italic">Agricola</span>, the poet Statius had composed 180 hexameters in honour of Crispinus, the sixteen-year-old son of Bolanus; the latter had died shortly before. Crispinus was on the verge of beginning his own career, as a military tribune, and Statius recalled, as an inspiration for the young man, the martial deeds of Bolanus, which included capturing &#145;the breastplate of a British king&#146;  (Statius, v.2, 148&#150;9). This can hardly be other than Venutius. At all events, Bolanus's successes may have been greater than is conveyed by Tacitus in his hostile version. Statius's poem also reveals that after the death of Bolanus, his widow had tried to poison Crispinus, who was probably as a consequence adopted into another family (the Clodii) and may be identified as the consul of 113, Gaius Clodius Crispinus. The elder son, Marcus Vettius Bolanus junior, was consul in 111.<br>
