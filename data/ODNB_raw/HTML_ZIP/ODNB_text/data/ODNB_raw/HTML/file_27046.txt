<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1694&#150;1761), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and tutor</span>, was born at Scotforth, Lancaster, the son of an Anglican timber merchant and his wife, a dissenter. Destined for the Christian ministry, he entered Thomas Dixon's dissenting academy at Whitehaven in 1709, where Caleb Rotheram, afterwards of Kendal, was among his contemporaries. During the course of his studies (1712) he devised his own Hebrew grammar, which ran to 100 pages, thereby laying the foundation for his scholarly eminence in that field. Three years of further instruction followed at Findern Academy under the capable classicist Thomas Hill. In his funeral oration for Taylor, Edward Harwood pronounced his classical scholarship &#145;almost unrivalled&#146;, though Samuel Parr queried his competence in Latin. Taylor left Findern on 25 March 1716. On 7 April he took charge of the extra-parochial chapel at Kirkstead, Lincolnshire, which was used for dissenting worship under the patronage of the Disney family, and was ordained by Derbyshire ministers on 11 April, no formal doctrinal subscription being sought. He undertook to &#145;maintain the truths of the Gospel, especially such as are beyond controversy determined in the Holy Scriptures&#146;  (James, 804). On 13 August 1717 he married a widow, Elizabeth Jenkinson (<i>d</i>. 1761) of Boston. Their two surviving children were Richard (<i>d</i>. 1762), father of Philip (1747&#150;1831), minister at Kay Street, Liverpool (1767), and at Eustace Street, Dublin (1771), and of John (1750&#150;1826), the hymn writer; and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1773), who married John Rigby of Chowbent, and whose son was the physician Edward Rigby (1747&#150;1821).<br>
<br>Life was hard at Kirkstead. Taylor eked out his annual stipend of &pound;33 by conducting a boarding-school. Even so he was not always able to heat his study&#151;to which cause he later attributed the rheumatism in his knees; neither could he afford to complete the abridgement of Matthew Henry's commentaries on which he had embarked. Though invited to the Pudsey church in 1726, Taylor continued at Kirkstead until 1733, when he became Peter Finch's colleague at Norwich. Finch, the son of the ejected Henry Finch (1633&#150;1704), had been maintaining orthodox Calvinism and expounding the Westminster catechisms at Norwich since 1691, and did so until his death in 1754. On his arrival, Taylor selected Samuel Clarke's <span class="italic">The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity</span> for congregational study, and was himself influenced by it in the direction of Arianism. As Harwood later remarked, &#145;if ever he expressed an uncommon warmth and honest indignation against anything, it was against <i>Athanasianism</i>, which he thought one of the greatest corruptions of pure and genuine Christianity, as this doctrine entirely subverts the unity of God&#146;  (Harwood, 40).<br>
<br>In 1735, under the influence of Samuel Clarke, Taylor finished writing <span class="italic">The Scripture-Doctrine of Original Sin</span>, but it was not published until 1740, with a second edition in the following year. It is widely reported that an unnamed Irish Calvinist minister warned his flock, &#145;I desire that none of you will read it, for it is a bad book, and a dangerous book; and, what is worse than all, the book is unanswerable&#146;  (Davis, 36). Influenced by Limborch, Taylor sought to rebut the Calvinist view of original sin on scriptural grounds, larding his case with moral repugnance. The Calvinist doctrine turns God into a monster: &#145;pray consider seriously what a God He must be who can be displeased with and curse His innocent creatures even before they have a being&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scripture-Doctrine of Original Sin</span>, 151). Among respondents to Taylor were John Wesley, who in <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Original Sin</span> (1757) charged Taylor with overthrowing the foundations of primitive, scriptural Christianity; Samuel Hebden who, standing foursquare on the Westminster confession, upheld the sole agency of the Holy Spirit in regeneration against Taylor's view that virtue and holiness result from the free and right choices of human beings; and Jonathan Edwards who, in <span class="italic">The Great Christian Doctrine of Original Sin Defended</span>, argued that if we do not posit universal depravity we cannot explain how every individual does, in fact, freely choose what is evil. Nevertheless, with hindsight it was observed that Taylor's <span class="italic">Original Sin</span> &#145;did more than any other [book] to emancipate the English Presbyterian Dissenters from Calvinism&#146;  (&#145;British and Foreign Unitarian Association Centenary Exhibition&#146;, <span class="italic">Transactions of the Unitarian Historical Society</span>, 3, 1923&#150;6, 228).<br>
<br>In the meantime Taylor had, in 1737, earned the favour of some and the disapprobation of others for his defence of the layman Joseph Rawson, who had been accused of embracing Arianism, and had accordingly been removed from the membership roll of Castle Gate Church, Nottingham, at the instigation of the minister, James Sloss, a former pupil, though clearly not a clone, of the liberal John Simson of Glasgow, who had himself been threatened with a heresy trial. Taylor was utterly opposed to what he took to be unwarrantable tests of church membership, and in <span class="italic">A Further Defence of the Common Rights of Christians</span> (1738) he thundered, &#145;A popish, anti-christian Spirit, I will ever oppose, as God shall enable me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Further Defence</span>, 78). In 1745 he published his <span class="italic">Paraphrase with Notes on &hellip; Romans</span>, which prompted John Barker's expostulation to Philip Doddridge in a letter of 26 March 1745: &#145;What an Audacious theolougue is that Taylor! Unhappy Norwich! Poor Mr. Finch!&#146;  (Nuttall, no. 1048). Taylor prefixed a &#145;Key to the apostolic writings&#146; to his <span class="italic">Paraphrase</span>, concerning which, and with reference to Taylor's indebtedness to Locke, Doddridge, in a letter to Samuel Wood of 19 April 1745, declared that &#145;a certain Key &hellip; seems broke in the Lock&#146;  (ibid., no. 1055).<br>
<br>In 1750 Taylor published <span class="italic">A Collection of Tunes in Various Airs</span>, to which is prefixed an introduction to the art of singing. He used the book when training his choir of young people at Norwich. <span class="italic">The Scripture-Doctrine of the Atonement</span> appeared in 1751, followed by the two volumes of Taylor's <span class="italic">The Hebrew Concordance Adapted to the English Bible</span> (1754, 1757). In the former work, which drew a reply from the high-Calvinist Baptist John Brine, Taylor insists (unlike later liberal exponents of exemplarist views of the atonement) that Christ died to take away sin, but he does not accept that the Son had to die in order to make the Father merciful. The first volume of the latter work, dedicated to the archbishops and bishops of England and Ireland, contains a subscription list including twenty-two English bishops, fifteen Irish bishops, and such prominent nonconformists as Job Orton, Joseph Priestley, and Taylor's college contemporary Caleb Rotheram. For his biblical work Taylor was, on 20 January 1756, awarded the degree of DD by the University of Glasgow, his promoters including William Leechman and Adam Smith. Looking back, the Congregationalist John Stoughton judged that &#145;The Independents had no Hebrew scholar to be compared with Taylor of Warrington&#146;  (J. Stoughton, <span class="italic">History of Religion in England, from the Opening of the Long Parliament to the End of the Eighteenth Century</span>, 1881, 6.322).<br>
<br>On 12 May 1756 Taylor preached at the opening of the Octagon Chapel in Norwich, the foundation-stone of which he had laid on 25 February 1754. When John Wesley visited the building, designed by Thomas Ivory, on 23 December 1757 he described its elegant interior, ruefully wondering, &#145;How can it be thought that the old coarse gospel should find admission here?&#146;  (J. Wesley, <span class="italic">The Works of the Rev. John Wesley, A.M.</span>, 1872, 2.431). In 1756 Taylor published <span class="italic">The Lord's Supper Explained upon Scripture Principles</span>, and in 1757 there appeared <span class="italic">The Covenant of Grace, and Baptism the Token of it</span>, in which he drew an analogy between paedobaptism in the church and circumcision in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>. The Baptist Grantham Killingworth published a rebuttal in the following year.<br>
<br>By the end of 1757 Taylor had, in response to insistent appeals, moved to Warrington to become the first tutor in divinity and moral philosophy at the academy which had opened on 20 October. The secretary of the trustees and inspiration of the entire project, John Seddon, received a letter from his friend Philip Holland concerning the proposal to extend an invitation to Taylor:<blockquote>There can be no doubt, I think, but he will undertake the care of the Academy, when invited to it, but I wish there will not be some little difficulty in finding him a colleague that he will approve of, and that he may not aim at too much in the business of lecturing. (McLachlan, <span class="italic">Warrington Academy</span>, 18)</blockquote>In the event, Taylor was not happy at Warrington: &#145;My condition ever since I came to Warrington has been very uneasy, and I may say, wretched&#146;  (Harwood, 49). A variety of factors conspired against him. For a start, he was not in good health, and rheumatism now required his use of two sticks, and he was concerned for his wife's frailty. His relations with Seddon deteriorated for he was incensed when Seddon took it upon himself to offer some theological lectures, and complained that Seddon refused to purchase library books recommended by the tutors. He opposed Seddon and those Liverpool ministers who were urging set forms of worship, and in his posthumous work <span class="italic">The Scripture Account of Prayer</span> (1761) he made out a strong case for free prayer in worship, though &#145;only so far as it is rational; not any extravagant effusions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scripture Account of Prayer</span>, 5). Although in his annual address to the students Taylor advocated the impartial weighting of evidence and the according of conscientious rights of judgement to others, it is suggested that he waxed dictatorial when students adopted opinions other than his own. In particular, and despite his associations with Glasgow, he is said to have been displeased when the students inclined more towards Hutcheson's moral sense theory of ethics (of which Taylor published an <span class="italic">Examination</span> in 1759) than towards that of William Wollaston, to whose book <span class="italic">The Religion of Nature Delineated</span> Taylor's <span class="italic">A Sketch of Moral Philosophy</span> (1760) was intended as a guide and endorsement. However there is no evidence of friction on this score between Taylor and Hutcheson's pupil and disciple Samuel Bourn during the latter's assistantship to Taylor from 1754 to 1757. The rightness of an action, Taylor argues, does not depend upon the agent's will, or upon teleological considerations, but solely upon the nature of the action as such, this being determined by reason&#151;that is, by conscience. Taylor's divinity class notes, <span class="italic">A Scheme of Scripture Divinity</span>, first printed for the use of students by the Warrington trustees in 1761, were posthumously published in 1763.<br>
<br>Taylor died in his sleep, a disappointed man, in Warrington on 5 March 1761. A number of subscribers to Warrington Academy invoked the ungracious treatment of Taylor as the ground (or the pretext) of their discontinued support, but other more deep-rooted problems brought about its closure twelve years later. Taylor and his wife, who died three months later, on 2 June 1761, were buried at Chowbent Chapel graveyard, Atherton, Lancashire. A tablet in the vestibule at Chowbent commemorates them both, and in the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, there is a memorial tablet to Taylor.<br>
