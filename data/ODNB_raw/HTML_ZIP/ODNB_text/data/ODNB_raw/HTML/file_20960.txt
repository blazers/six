<span class="headword">Outram, Sir  Benjamin Fonseca</span>  (1774&#150;1856), <span class="occ">surgeon and naval officer</span>, son of Captain William Outram, was born in Kilham, near Bridlington, Yorkshire, and baptized at Gravesend, Kent. He was apprenticed to a Mr Coleman and later to Mr William Harvis, surgeon-apothecaries of Gravesend. He joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon's mate in 1794, serving in the frigate <i>Isis</i>. Promoted to the rank of surgeon in 1796, he served in the <i>Harpy</i>, <i>La Nymphe</i>, and <i>Boadicea</i>, where his medical competence and clinical acumen won high praise from Dr Thomas Trotter, physician of the fleet. He was surgeon in the <i>Superb</i> in her celebrated action off Algeciras, when Sir James Saumarez routed the French and Spanish fleets on 12 July 1801, and his presence of mind prevented an explosion on board. He received war medals and clasps for his services under Sir Richard Goodwin Keats during the war. The brief peace enabled him to undertake further surgical training at Guy's Hospital, London, and on the renewal of hostilities he served in the hospital ship <i>Matilda</i>, the frigate <i>Euryalus</i>, and the yachts <i>Royal Charlotte</i> and <i>Royal Sovereign</i>. During this period he studied intermittently in Edinburgh, where he graduated doctor of medicine on 24 June 1809, after presenting his inaugural thesis, &#145;De febre continua&#146;. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, on 16 April 1810, and practised as a physician in London, where he lived more than forty years, from 1832 in Hanover Square. He also acted as physician to the Welbeck Street Dispensary. On 18 May 1811 he married Ann Scales, widow of Captain Richard Corne RN, with whom he travelled extensively, and they spent several years on the continent. She died suddenly at Clifton, near Bristol, in 1852.<br>
<br>On 3 May 1838 Outram was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, but was not the author of the geological paper published in its <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (1796), with which his name is associated in the list of fellows. He also became one of the earliest members of the Royal Geographical Society, where he proved a faithful friend and a kind and congenial colleague, contributing actively to its meetings.<br>
<br>In 1841 Outram became inspector of fleets and hospitals. He was made a knight bachelor and companion of the bath on 17 September 1850, and was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 9 July 1852.<br>
<br>On 10 October 1855 Outram married Sally, the daughter of Joseph Outram, a near relative of General Sir James Outram. He contracted cholera while travelling to a scientific meeting and died on 18 February 1856 while convalescing at Brighton. He was buried with his first wife at Clifton.<br>
<br>A man of considerable affluence, Outram was an able clinician with wide scientific interests, and a generous philanthropist. His uncle Captain Sir Thomas Outram left him a small estate in Kilham.<br>
<br>Outram left legacies to his friends, &pound;4000 to his domestics and &pound;100 each to the Fistula Hospital, the Institution for the Widows of Medical Men of London, the Naval School for Boys at New Cross, the Naval Benevolent Institution, and the Distressed Governesses' Society.<br>
<br>Outram published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Suggestions to Naval Surgeons Previous to, during, and after a Battle</span>, and &#145;An account of the action in the Straits of the Mediterranean on the night of the 12th of July 1801&#146;, published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and used by T. S. Hughes in his continuation of Hume and Smollett's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (1857).<br>
