<span class="headword">Bannerman,  Anne</span>  (1765&#150;1829), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 31 October 1765 in Edinburgh, the daughter of William Bannerman, and his wife, Isobel Dick. Bannerman was a highly gifted poet, part of the Edinburgh poetic circle that also included John Leyden, Thomas Campbell, and Dr Robert Anderson. Anderson, the editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>, encouraged Bannerman's publications from the late 1790s, sending copies and praising her poetry to important literary figures of the day. Through the efforts of Anderson and Thomas Park (the antiquary and editor), Bannerman's poetry was read and admired by such literary men as James Currie (Burns's first biographer), Bishop Percy (editor of <span class="italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span>), and Joseph Cooper Walker (Irish writer on Italian tragedy and lifelong friend of Charlotte Smith). Bannerman was an old friend of John Leyden (Scott's co-editor of <span class="italic">The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span>, 1802&#150;3), whose best-known ballad, &#145;The Mermaid&#146;, appeared two years after Bannerman's own remarkable ode, &#145;The Mermaid&#146;, was published in her 1800 <span class="italic">Poems</span>. Leyden and Bannerman fell out shortly before he left Edinburgh for London, on his way to India, though after his death there in 1811 it was Bannerman who rescued many of his papers which had been abandoned by his executor.<br>
<br>Like most Romantic writers, Bannerman began her career by publishing in the periodicals, as Augusta, as B, and under her own name in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Poetical Register</span>, and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span>. Her first volume, <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1800), was widely praised in reviews and correspondence, although it did not sell well. <span class="italic">Poems</span> contains a series of remarkable original odes, as well as a sonnet series translated from Petrarch, one series based on <span class="italic">The Sorrows of Werther</span>, and original sonnets. In her two sonnet series Bannerman expanded Joanna Baillie's theory of dramatic composition, elaborated in Baillie's &#145;Introductory discourse&#146; to her <span class="italic">Plays &hellip; on the Passions</span> (1796), by applying it to the sonnet, explaining in <span class="italic">Poems</span> that &#145;an attempt has been made in the &#147;Sonnets from Werter&#148; [<i>sic</i>], to delineate the progress of a single passion &hellip; In this manner a <i>unity</i> may be communicated&#146;  (Bannerman, 220). A great admirer of Baillie, Bannerman sent her a presentation copy of <span class="italic">Poems</span>.<br>
<br>Bannerman's longer 1800 poems, such as &#145;The Genii&#146; and &#145;Ode: the Spirit of the Air&#146; were often singled out for praise in reviews, as evoking a sublime and visionary poetic identity, as the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> noted: &#145;Anne Bannerman's Odes may be quoted as an irrefragable proof that the ardour, whatever be its gender, which gives birth to lofty thought and bold expression, may glow within a female <i>breast</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Critical Review</span>, 435). She may also have been the author of the anonymous verse <span class="italic">Epistle from the Marquis de Lafayette to General Washington</span>, also published in 1800.<br>
<br>Bannerman's second volume, <span class="italic">Tales of Superstition and Chivalry</span> (1802), published anonymously, comprised ten Gothic ballads and four engravings, the fourth of which, &#145;The Prophecy of Merlin&#146;, caused a small scandal because it featured a nude female figure, causing it to be withdrawn from the volume at the author's request, although some copies have survived. Unlike her positively reviewed 1800 volume, the <span class="italic">Tales</span> was frequently derided, with critics and fellow poets such as Anna Seward growing frustrated with her Gothic poetry's cultivation of the &#145;palpable obscure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Seward</span>, 5.325). In 1802 she also translated several verse passages for Joseph Cooper Walker's <span class="italic">An Historical and Critical Essay on the Revival of the Drama in Italy</span> (1805), and declined his offer to translate longer works.<br>
<br>The death of her mother in 1803 and of her brother left Bannerman without any source of income, and she began to support herself through the charity of friends such as Anderson, Park, and Beattie. Anderson and Park obtained for her a new edition of her poems by subscription, hoping that she would be able to live off the interest. At first reluctant to publish by subscription, Bannerman soon agreed, though the volume, <span class="italic">Poems: a New Edition</span> (1807) sold poorly and had insufficient subscribers to grant her an annuity. The volume included most of the poems in the 1800 and 1802 volumes, with some revised and some new works, such as her poem &#145;To Miss Baillie&#146;. Park was able to obtain &pound;20 from the Royal Literary Fund for her in 1805, though an attempt to gain her a pension failed. With Anderson's help and insistence, in 1807 Bannerman accepted the position of governess for Lady Frances Beresford's daughter in Exeter for &pound;60 per year. She visited Park in Hampstead during this time, and by the early 1810s was back in Scotland, existing at least partially through gifts from the Beresford family, and visiting the writer Anne Grant in 1824.<br>
<br>On 29 September 1829 Bannerman died an invalid and in debt in Portobello, near Edinburgh, with two of her poems appearing in <span class="italic">The Laurel</span> (1830) and <span class="italic">The Casket</span> (1829). After her death, Lady Frances Beresford and her family paid &pound;22 toward Bannerman's debts and spoke fondly of her, though she urged a mutual friend to destroy all of Bannerman's letters. After her death, Walter Scott praised her poetry in his &#145;Essay on imitations of the ancient ballad&#146; (1830), and noted her poetry's characteristic obscurity:<blockquote>Miss Anne Bannerman likewise should not be forgotten, whose <span class="italic">Tales of Superstition and Chivalry</span> appeared about 1802. They were perhaps too mystical and too abrupt; yet if it be the purpose of this kind of ballad poetry powerfully to excite the imagination, without pretending to satisfy it, few persons have succeeded better than this gifted lady, whose volume is peculiarly fit to be read in a lonely house by a decaying lamp. (Scott, 4.16&#150;17)</blockquote>Bannerman was the only female poet Scott included in this essay on Scottish ballads, and she remains significant for her Gothic ballads, as well as for her innovative sonnet series and her bold original odes.<br>
