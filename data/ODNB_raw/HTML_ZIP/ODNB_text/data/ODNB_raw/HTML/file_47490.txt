<span class="headword">Dixon family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1770s&#150;1880), <span class="occ">iron and coal masters</span>, were for three generations deeply involved in the coal and iron industries of western Scotland. They came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_48965"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Dixon</span>  (1753&#150;1824), <span class="occ">iron and coal master</span>, whose origins are obscure but who is reputed to have come to Scotland from Northumberland in 1770 or 1771; during the 1770s he was engaged as manager of the Govan colliery, indicating that he had probably trained as a mining engineer in the north-east of England. This appointment commenced an association of the names Dixon and Govan that was to last almost 200 years until the Govan ironworks, or &#145;Dixon's blazes&#146;, so named for its furnaces' lighting up the night sky, was dismantled in 1958.<br>
<br>The first William Dixon was ambitious and hardworking, and while manager at Govan set up the Calder ironworks in Lanarkshire in 1795 in partnership with David Mushet, the discoverer of the local blackband iron ore which was intermixed with the coal-seams, and James Creelman, a local pottery manufacturer. The partnership lasted until 1802, when Dixon bought out the concern for &pound;19,000; he followed this in 1803 with the purchase of the estate of Palacecraig, lying centrally in the rich coal and ore seams of north Lanarkshire. All of this was undertaken while Dixon still managed the Govan collieries, and when these were put up for sale in 1813 at a price of &pound;30,000 he acquired four-ninths of the stock. He worked with the other members of the purchasing combine for six years, and finally acquired sole control of the Govan colliery in 1819. To this he added further mineral estates at Govanhill and Faskine, also in 1819, and the mineral lands and ironworks at Wilsontown in 1824, the year of his death. In a long working life he had created an extensive coal and iron empire with collieries at Govan, Faskine, Palacecraig, Wilsontown, and Legbrannock, together with ironworks at Calder and Wilsontown.<br>
<br>On William Dixon's death in 1824 his considerable empire passed to his two sons John and William. There was property but little liquid capital, and the elder son John, unwilling to take on the business, sold out to the younger <a name="cosubject_48967"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Dixon</span>  (1788&#150;1859), <span class="occ">iron and coal master</span>. To buy out his brother, William like his father before him had to resort to a partnership with three other investors. This arrangement lasted eleven years until 1835, when Dixon regained control of the family business. He married Elizabeth Strang, and they had at least one son, who was born at Gallowknow, Gorbals, in Lanarkshire.<br>
<br>The second William Dixon shared his father's drive and ambition. Some time between 1835 and 1840 he sold the lands of Palacecraig to the Bairds of Gartsherrie, purchased another estate at Carfin, near Wishaw, and began smelting and puddling at his newly established Govan Bar Iron Works. He was active in experimenting with the substitution of raw coal for coke in the furnace, and also with J. B. Neilson's idea of heating the blast. He managed to reach a temperature of 600&deg;F in tests and was reported to have made three times as much iron with the same quantity of coal as before. Satisfied with this he blew in the first blast furnace at Govan in 1837. He then closed the Wilsontown ironworks in 1842, and concentrated his iron interests at Govan and Calder.<br>
<br>By the late 1840s Dixon was among the leading coal and iron masters in Scotland, his collieries then providing around 150,000 tons of coal per year. He was a man of great energy and drive, and one who exercised close and detailed control over all his business operations. He was also a citizen of some standing, a trustee of the savings bank of Glasgow and a town councillor. Unfortunately, he was a man of inflexible opinion. He constantly engaged in litigation, notably over Neilson's hot blast patent and with the trustees of the Clyde Navigation, and the Monkland Canal Authority. In the early 1850s this brought him close to bankruptcy, and he was rescued only by loans from friends to meet his debts; these were not repaid until after his death in 1859.<br>
<br>Control of the Dixon empire passed over to his son <a name="cosubject_48968"></a><span class="headword">William Smith Dixon</span>  (1824&#150;1880), <span class="occ">iron and coal master</span>, who had been assistant to his father for some years. Unlike his father and grandfather, William S. Dixon was a cautious manager rather than a risk taker. Under his control the colliery side expanded in the 1860s with new mines at Cockerhill, Titwood, and Ibrox. In the early 1870s, when the new deeper coalfield around Blantyre, 10 miles south-east of Glasgow, was being developed, Dixon chose to convert his company to limited liability status. In 1872 Dixon issued 465 shares of &pound;1000 each, and with the capital extended mining into the Blantyre district. After this it seems that William S. Dixon withdrew from active management and spent much of his time in London or at his estate at Belleisle, Ayr. He served as deputy lieutenant for Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, and was also a major in the 2nd Lanarkshire militia. The community where his works were situated benefited from his generosity, including his funding of the town halls of the joint burghs of Crosshill and Govanhill. Dixon married Catherine Ann, daughter of David Napier, a Singapore merchant, on 21 August 1851.<br>
<br>William S. Dixon died on 16 June 1880 at his home, 14 Grosvenor Place, London, at the early age of fifty-six. He and his wife (who survived him) did not have any children, and thereafter the company was carried on by trustees, becoming a publicly limited company in 1906. The Govan colliery finally closed in 1926.<br>
