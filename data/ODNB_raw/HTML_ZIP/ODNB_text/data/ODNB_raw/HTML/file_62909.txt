<span class="headword">Griffith <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wynne]</span>,  Sidney</span>  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1752), <span class="occ">follower of Methodism</span>, was the daughter of Cadwaladr Wynne and his wife, Jane Griffith (<i>d</i>. 1771) of Foelas, Ysbyty Ifan, Denbighshire, but her date of birth is unknown. She was named in honour of her grandmother, a member of the prominent Thelwall family. Her marriage to William Griffith (1721&#150;1751) of Cefnamwlch in Caernarvonshire is believed to have taken place in 1741, for in 1742 she gave birth to her only son, John Griffith, high sheriff of Caernarvonshire in 1765.<br>
<br>Griffith converted to the Methodist cause under the ministry of the Methodist clergyman Peter Williams in 1746. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12392/', "Howel Harris")</script>, one of the leaders of the early Methodist movement in Wales, met her for the first time during a preaching tour of north Wales in October 1748. The strong-minded and attractive young woman made a lasting impression on Harris, who was always gratified when members of the gentry were drawn to the movement. Her first visit to Harris's home at Trefeca in Brecknockshire took place in February 1749 and she soon began to accompany him on his preaching journeys. In July 1749 she fled to Trefeca to seek refuge from her unhappy marriage and her drunken and abusive husband, who was compared by John Wesley to one of the &#145;ruffians&#146; in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>.<br>
<br>Harris insisted that &#145;Madam Griffith&#146; should be regarded as a prophetess and referred to her as his &#145;Eye&#146; and his &#145;Light&#146;. In this capacity she attended meetings of the Association, the governing body of the Methodist movement in Wales, despite the fact that the movement tended to disapprove of women adopting a prominent public role. Ultimately, however, the relationship proved to be one of the contributory factors in the quarrel which divided the Welsh Methodist cause into two distinct camps in 1750. Doctrinal differences and increasing tension as a result of Harris's fractious personality were also to play a major part in the division, which led to most of the Methodist exhorters siding with Daniel Rowland against Harris.<br>
<br>Harris's infatuation has in the past been frequently attributed to his declining mental health, and it has been suggested that exhaustion led him to the brink of a total breakdown by the late 1740s. It has also been claimed that Mrs Whitefield actively sought to poison Anne Harris's mind against Madam Griffith out of malice and jealousy. The precise nature of the relationship remains a topic of debate among Welsh historians, particularly since Harris's diary entries are ambiguous and open to various interpretations. There can be little doubt that he was utterly enchanted by her. His marriage to Anne Williams in 1744 had not been a great success, partly because his wife's ill health did not allow her to accompany him on his preaching tours. Speculation regarding the relationship with Madam Griffith caused Harris's associates to urge him to relinquish his prophetess for the good of the movement. Harris, however, proved to be intractable and succeeded in alienating many of his closest colleagues by his refusal to listen to reason. It is difficult to know what Griffith's own feelings and attitudes were, since so much evidence regarding the relationship comes either from Harris's own writings or from contemporary supposition. She could be obstinate and determined, and occasionally supported Daniel Rowland against Harris on matters of doctrine. She also at times proved to be something of a financial burden, since her husband was loath to contribute to her maintenance before he finally fell and broke his neck in February 1751.<br>
<br>Griffith died on 31 May 1752 at The Lodge, Hyde Park, and was buried in Audley Chapel, London. Harris was grief-stricken and continued to mourn her passing for the rest of his life. It could be argued, however, that her death removed one major stumbling block in the way of his eventual reconciliation with the remainder of the Methodist movement in 1763.<br>
