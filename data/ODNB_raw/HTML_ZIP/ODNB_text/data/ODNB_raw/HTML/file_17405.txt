<span class="headword">M'Creery,  John</span>  (1768&#150;1832), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was born at Burndennet near Strabane in co. Tyrone; his father was probably James M'Creery (<i>c</i>.1745&#150;1811), a printer in Strabane. John M'Creery came to Liverpool, where he was apprenticed to George Wood (1754&#150;1815), printer of Princes Street. M'Creery set up as a printer in Houghton Street, Liverpool, his earliest imprints being dated 1792, when he printed Thomas Hall's <span class="italic">Achmet to Selim, or, The Dying Negro</span>, a slim quarto. M'Creery became acquainted with William Roscoe, who played a leading part in many Liverpool institutions, and who became M'Creery's principal patron, entrusting to him the printing of his <span class="italic">Life of Lorenzo de' Medici</span> (2 vols., 1796). M'Creery produced much ephemeral work for those Liverpool institutions with which Roscoe was associated. While these are no better than the jobbing work of his time, he aspired to fine printing, as he clearly indicates in the preface to the first part of his <span class="italic">The Press: a Poem</span> (1803), which was set in the transitional typeface cut by William Martin for the Boydell Shakespeare, printed by William Bulmer; it was illustrated with wood-engravings by Henry Hole, a former apprentice of Thomas Bewick. In this preface, expatiating on the &#145;art&#146; of printing, M'Creery also makes clear his belief that his &#145;remote&#146; situation in Liverpool prevented his achieving fine printing. However, a study of his output suggests that his later work did not improve upon the substantial books that he produced for Roscoe while in Liverpool.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, in 1805, with William Martin's advice, M'Creery moved to London, establishing himself in Black Horse Court, Fleet Street, and registering his press under the <span class="roman">Seditious Societies Act</span> on 28 December of that year. He became free of the Stationers' Company by redemption on 4 February 1806, and was immediately cloathed in the livery; he was active on the committee of master printers, which was at that time negotiating wages with the journeymen compositors and pressmen. He still relied to a considerable extent on his former Liverpool patrons, especially Roscoe, for work, though initially he gained some support in London, printing <span class="italic">Bibliomania</span> (2 vols., 1811) for the demanding author T. F. Dibdin. In spite of Dibdin's praise M'Creery's business declined, and by 1817 he had only a single compositor at work. He published a second part of <span class="italic">The Press</span> in 1827. He appears to have been a poor man of business, and had retired by June 1828. Soon afterwards he returned to Liverpool. In the autumn of 1831 M'Creery visited Paris with his wife and daughters, and on 18 April 1832 he died there of cholera. His body was brought back to England, and he was buried in London at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
