<span class="headword">Reach,  Angus Bethune</span>  (1821&#150;1856), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born at Inverness on 23 January 1821, the son of Roderick Reach (<i>d</i>. 1853), a solicitor, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bethune. He was educated at the Inverness Royal Academy and then at Edinburgh University, where he contributed literary articles to the <span class="italic">Inverness Courier</span>, which his father had formerly owned.<br>
<br>In 1842 the family moved to London, where Charles Mackay, then sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, found work for Reach as a reporter at the central criminal court and afterwards in the House of Commons gallery. In 1848 he contributed to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> most of a series of articles entitled &#145;Labour and the poor&#146;, which Fox Bourne described as &#145;an unparalleled exploit in journalism&#146;  (Fox Bourne, 2.154). They helped inspire Henry Mayhew's <span class="italic">London Labour and the London Poor</span> (1851, 1862), which also began life as a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>Besides the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, Reach wrote for the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span> (January&#150;October 1845), <span class="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</span> (February 1853 &#150; October 1854), <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, <span class="italic">The Era</span>, and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. He was associated with two short-lived imitations of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, Henry and James Vizetelly's the <span class="italic">Puppet Show</span> (1848) (on which his leading colleagues were Henry Sutherland Edwards and James Hannay) and the <span class="italic">Man in the Moon</span> (1847&#150;9), which he edited in collaboration with Albert Smith and which for a time threatened to rival <span class="italic">Punch</span> itself. He joined the staff of <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1849. His pioneering gossip column in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (1850&#150;51), &#145;Town talk and table talk&#146;, was the forerunner of the paper's famous column &#145;Echoes of the week&#146;, edited for many years by George Augustus Sala. Between 1847 and 1850 he published several short humorous monographs, including four &#145;natural histories&#146; of society in the style of Albert Smith's &#145;physiologies&#146;, and <span class="italic">A Romance of a Mince Pie</span> (1850), which was illustrated by Phiz. A sensational romance, <span class="italic">Clement Lorimer, or, The Book with the Iron Clasps</span>, with twelve etchings by Cruikshank, was published in monthly parts in 1848&#150;9, in a single volume in 1849, and as a two-volume novel, <span class="italic">Leonard Lindsay, or, The Story of a Buccaneer</span>, in 1850. As a &#145;special commissioner&#146; he wrote a much admired series of letters to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> on the vineyards of France, republished in book form as <span class="italic">Claret and Olives</span> in 1852, and also reported on the manufacturing and coal-mining districts of the north of England. For more than ten years he was a musical, theatrical, and art critic, as well as principal book reviewer, for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. In addition he was London correspondent of the <span class="italic">Glasgow Citizen</span> and, after his father's death in 1853, of the <span class="italic">Inverness Courier</span>, a role in which first Shirley Brooks and then Edmund Yates succeeded him. He wrote many dramatic farces, of which only one, <span class="italic">Jenny Lind at Last, or, The Swedish Nightingale</span> (1847), appears to have been published.<br>
<br>Early in 1855 Reach was incapacitated by what Edmund Yates described as &#145;an attack of softening of the brain&#146;  (Yates, 1.270). Shirley Brooks obtained grants for him of &pound;50 and &pound;100 from the Royal Literary Fund and the Royal Bounty Fund respectively. On 31 March 1855 members of the Fielding Club led by Albert Smith and Yates staged a benefit pantomime at the Olympic Theatre to raise money for him and his wife: the audience included Dickens and Thackeray, and a repeat performance was given at Drury Lane Theatre before the queen, the prince consort, and the prince of Wales. For a year before his death Shirley Brooks carried out Reach's work for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Inverness Courier</span>, handing the proceeds to Reach's wife.<br>
<br>Reach died at Camberwell Green, London, on 25 November 1856 and was buried in Norwood cemetery. Sala spoke of his &#145;brilliant talents&#146;, to which &#145;not half enough justice&#146; was done in the forty years after his death, and described him as &#145;one of the most laborious and prolific writers&#146; he had ever met with. But Reach still found time for late-night revelry with Sala and his bohemian circle at the Caf&eacute; de l'Europe in the Haymarket  (<span class="italic">Life and Adventures</span>, 164&#150;5), and it can probably be assumed that drink contributed as much as overwork to his early death. Yates remembered him as &#145;an earnest-faced long-haired young man&#146;  (Yates, 1.216). His name was pronounced as a disyllable: Re-ach.<br>
