<span class="headword">Lowther,  William</span>, first earl of Lonsdale  (1757&#150;1844), <span class="occ">landowner and literary patron</span>, was born on 29 December 1757 at Little Preston Hall, near Leeds, the elder son of the Revd Sir William Lowther, baronet (1707&#150;1788), rector of Swillington, and Anne Zouch (1723&#150;1759), daughter of the Revd Charles Zouch, vicar of Sandal near Wakefield. He was educated at Felsted School, Essex (1769&#150;71), Westminster School (1771&#150;2), by private tutor (1773&#150;5), and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1776&#150;8) where he became a friend of Pitt.<br>
<br>In 1780 Lowther was elected MP for Carlisle under the patronage of his godfather and third cousin once removed, the tyrannical Sir James Lowther (later earl of Lonsdale), and a year later, on 12 July 1781, married Lady Augusta Fane (1761&#150;1838), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9135/', "John Fane, ninth earl of Westmorland")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9134/', "Fane, John, seventh earl of Westmorland")</script>]. They had two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17114/', "William Lowther")</script>, and five daughters. In the 1784 election Lowther was returned for Cumberland but in 1790 was dropped by Lonsdale &#145;without any reason &hellip; and without Lonsdale even signifying any offence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Boswell</span>, 80). In 1788 he had succeeded his father as second baronet, of Swillington, and inherited the family's large Yorkshire estate with its collieries. In 1796 he re-entered parliament as member for Rutland, where he now lived, and was free from the tight political reins of his godfather; but he was a reluctant speaker in the house.<br>
<br>In 1797 the childless earl of Lonsdale received the additional titles of Viscount and Baron Lowther of Whitehaven with special remainder to Sir William, his nearest male Lowther relative. The distant cousins were back on speaking terms. On Lonsdale's death on 24 May 1802 Sir William became Viscount Lowther and inherited the family's vast estates in Cumberland and Westmorland including the lucrative collieries and flourishing harbour of Whitehaven. By a previous arrangement the family's Yorkshire estates then passed to Sir William's brother.<br>
<br>William Lowther became overnight one of the wealthiest men in the kingdom (his annual income was estimated to be nearly &pound;100,000), the controller of eight (later nine) seats in parliament, the patron of thirty-two parishes, and lord lieutenant of Cumberland and Westmorland (appointed 16 June 1802). His newly acquired wealth brought him great influence which, in contrast to his predecessor, he used generously and with sympathy. Immediately on inheriting, he arranged a compromise with the duke of Norfolk over the filling of the two seats for Carlisle to avoid an expensive and unseemly campaign at the forthcoming election. Soon afterwards he repaid, with full interest, the earl's twenty-year-old debt of &pound;5000 to William and Dorothy Wordsworth, a debt which arose from legal and political fees owing to the poet's father, who had been Lonsdale's law agent and land steward in Cockermouth for twenty-three years until his death in 1783. Throughout the succeeding years Lonsdale had resisted a series of lawsuits brought by the guardians of the Wordsworth children for payment of the debt. Repayment of &pound;8500 was made by William Lowther within eighteen months of his inheritance.<br>
<br>In 1806 Lowther was selected by the earl of Chatham to be one of the six assistant mourners at Pitt's funeral &#145;as one of the nearest of his friends&#146;  (Chatham to Lowther, 17 Feb 1806, <span class="italic">Lonsdale MSS</span>, 166). In the following year he was created earl of Lonsdale and received the Order of the Garter for his part in negotiating the duke of Portland's new administration after the resignation of Grenville, but he declined a seat in the cabinet.<br>
<br>On inheriting Lowther Hall, the family seat in Westmorland, Lowther found it in a deplorable state and commissioned Robert Smirke, the future architect of the British Museum, to build Lowther Castle. It was the young architect's first major commission, described by Wordsworth as &#145;a baronial castle&#146; of &#145;majestic pile&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, 477). The artist Jacob Thompson was another whom Lonsdale set on the road to fame.<br>
<br>William Wordsworth and Lonsdale became firm friends and mutual admirers, and in 1818 Lonsdale was able again to ease the poet's financial position by arranging his appointment as distributor of stamps for Westmorland. For their part Wordsworth and his sister worked tirelessly in the Lowther interest during the general election campaigns of 1818 and 1820. In 1828 Lonsdale presented Wordsworth's clergyman son to the first of three livings in his gift.<br>
<br>For many years Wordsworth paid an annual visit of a week or more to Lowther Castle and sometimes stayed also at Whitehaven Castle. Occasionally he even sent his verse to Lonsdale for comment and accepted the earl's suggestions for changes. &#145;He was to myself and my children the best benefactor&#146;, Wordsworth wrote to Lady Frederick Bentinck on 31 March 1844  (De Selincourt, 7.539).<br>
<br>Lonsdale died on 19 March 1844 at York House, Twickenham, aged eighty-six, and was buried on 1 April in Lowther church beside his wife (<i>d</i>. 1838). &#145;How much is there to be thankful for in every part of Lord Lonsdale's life to its close&#146;, wrote Wordsworth  (De Selincourt, 7.539).<br>
