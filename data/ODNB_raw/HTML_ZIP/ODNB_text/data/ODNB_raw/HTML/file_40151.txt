<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Andrews,  Eamonn</span>  (1922&#150;1987), <span class="occ">radio and television broadcaster</span>, was born on 19 December 1922 at 11 Synge Street, Dublin, Ireland, the second of five children and elder son of William Andrews, carpenter, and his wife, Margaret Farrell. He was educated at a Dublin convent and the Synge Street Christian Brothers' school, where he became an altar boy. In spite of being tall for his age (he was later over 6 feet and weighed 14 stone) he was bullied at school and to overcome this he started taking boxing lessons. He was so successful that he became the all-Ireland juvenile middleweight boxing champion.<br>
<br>Andrews's first job was as a clerk with the Hibernian Insurance Company, from which he was dismissed when he was discovered doing a boxing commentary for Radio &Eacute;ireann. After many applications he was finally given more broadcasting work for Irish radio. In 1948 he comp&egrave;red the stage show <span class="italic">Double or Nothing</span> from the Theatre Royal, Dublin. It was seen by the English bandleader Joe Loss, who liked Andrews's voice and personality and invited him to take the programme on tour with the band in England. When he was at the Theatre Royal he met Grace (who was always known by the Gaelic version of her name, Grainne), daughter of Lorcan Bourke, a Dublin impresario. They married in 1951 and had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>In 1949, when Stewart MacPherson gave up his job as comp&egrave;re on a BBC radio programme, <span class="italic">Ignorance is Bliss</span>, Andrews wrote to the BBC stating his experience with Irish radio and asked to be considered for the job, which he got. The programme was a great success and Andrews's distinctive voice became known to his English audience. He was then asked to present the live weekly BBC radio programme <span class="italic">Sports Report</span>. Although he was badly paid for this, he undertook the programme in order to consolidate his position with the BBC, and he went on to present many successful worldwide boxing commentaries.<br>
<br>In 1951 a chairman was needed for a new BBC television panel game called <span class="italic">What's my Line?</span>, and two people were considered for the job&#151;Andrews and Gilbert Harding. As it happened, Harding joined the game's panel and Andrews became its chairman. The programme was such a national success that Andrews gained first-class status in television, being voted the top television personality of the year for four years running from 1956. He also appeared on a children's programme, <span class="italic">Crackerjack</span>.<br>
<br>The BBC bought a new American television programme, <span class="italic">This is Your Life</span>, in 1955, even though there was some doubt about its intrusive nature, which was not in the BBC style. Andrews presented the programme, which became an instant success and lasted until 1964, when for internal BBC reasons it was dropped. Greatly concerned, he accepted the chance to change channels to the new independent television station ABC TV. In 1964 he presented a late-night live talk programme, featuring five guests at the same time. <span class="italic">The Eamonn Andrews Show</span>, live from London, became the first television programme to broadcast at eleven o'clock at night and get into the top twenty television ratings.<br>
<br>One of Andrews's biggest challenges was to bring back his favourite programme, <span class="italic">This is Your Life</span>, on Thames Television in 1969. However, it became an even greater success, rising to the number one position in the national television ratings. It remained in the top ten programme lists and was watched by over 14 million people weekly. Andrews continued to present it until he died. The current affairs programme <span class="italic">Today</span> was also presented by him on three nights a week, which meant that for part of the year he was on television for four nights every week. In spite of this schedule, he found time to write for <span class="italic">Punch</span> magazine and was a member of the exclusive <span class="italic">Punch</span> lunch club. He was also (from 1960) chairman of Telefis, the Irish independent television service. He became one of the highest-paid entertainers on British television and was reputed to be a millionaire when some of his business activities failed towards his later years.<br>
<br>In 1964 Andrews became a papal knight of St Gregory (an honour given to him personally by the pope), and in 1970 he was appointed honorary CBE. Even at the height of his success he was always shy and reticent with strangers. Andrews, who never lost his Irish brogue, had an open face, with brown eyes, a broad smile, and a large chin. He died from heart failure at Cromwell Road Hospital, London, on 5 November 1987. His memorial service at Westminster Cathedral in London attracted more than 3000 people.<br>
