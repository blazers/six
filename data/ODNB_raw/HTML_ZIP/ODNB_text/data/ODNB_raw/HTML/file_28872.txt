<span class="headword">Watson,  Walter</span>  (1780&#150;1854), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Chryston, in the parish of Calder, Lanarkshire, on 29 March 1780, one of the three sons and four daughters of William Watson, hand-loom weaver. At the age of eight he became a herd, and attended the village school during winter. From eleven he worked as a weaver, and after a couple of years worked as a farmhand at home and as a sawyer in Glasgow. He enlisted in the Scots Greys in May 1799 but saw nothing more serious than drills and parades. He was discharged at the peace of Amiens, 1802. In March 1803 he married Margaret, daughter of Alexander Wilson of Hill Farm, near Chryston. They were to have eight sons and two daughters; however, only four children survived Watson.<br>
<br>From 1803 to 1820 Watson worked as a weaver in Chryston. He began writing poetry but was reprimanded by the village teacher for his lack of grammar. In 1808 he published a small volume of his poems. This was a troubled period in the weaving industry and Watson was periodically obliged to find employment as sawyer, stonecutter, and printer as the family moved around Stirlingshire, Lanarkshire, and Dunbartonshire. Another volume of poems was published in 1823 and yet another in 1843. In 1849 he settled at Duntiblae, near Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire, where he worked as a weaver. His <span class="italic">Poems and Songs, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect</span> was published in 1853. He died on 12 September 1854 at Duntiblae and was buried in Calder churchyard where a granite monument was erected in 1875.<br>
