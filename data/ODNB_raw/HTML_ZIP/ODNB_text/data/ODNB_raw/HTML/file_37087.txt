</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zangwill,  Israel</span>  (1864&#150;1926), <span class="occ">writer and advocate of Jewish causes</span>, was born on 21 January 1864 in Ebenezer Square, Houndsditch, Whitechapel, London, the second of the five children of Moses Zangwill (1836?&#150;1908), an itinerant pedlar, glazier, and rabbinical student, and his wife, Ellen Hannah Marks, a Polish Jewish immigrant. His father, according to J. H. Udelson, &#145;born evidently in a small Russian Baltic town, is said to have escaped czarist conscription and arrived in Britain in 1848, at the surprising age of twelve&#146;  (Udelson, 60). Israel quickly demonstrated high ability at school in Bristol, where his parents were living after moving from Plymouth. They then settled in London, where he won awards at the Jews' Free School, Bell Lane, Spitalfields. He was articled there as a teacher, and remained until 1888 when he was twenty-four. Four years earlier, in 1884, he had received his degree with honours in French, English, and mental and moral science from London University where he had attended evening classes.<br>
<br>Many of the contradictions and paradoxes in Zangwill's life and work have their origin in the incompatibility between his parents. His pious, observant father was a scripture reader in the synagogue, and in the 1890s left his family to live and pray in Jerusalem where he was supported by Zangwill. His mother was less religious than her husband and was remembered by her third and youngest son, Louis Zangwill (1869&#150;1938), &#145;as a Tartar&#146;, living with whom &#145;must have been hard for Moses Zangwill, who wanted a quiet life, prayer and study&#146;  (Leftwich, 90). She was also more freethinking and independent than her husband, was the dominant force in the home, and was ambitious for her children.<br>
<br>By June 1888 Zangwill had resigned from his teaching position to become a journalist on the staff of the newly founded weekly newspaper the <span class="italic">Jewish Standard</span>. He wrote a weekly column for this newspaper until 27 February 1891, four months before it folded. Another reason for leaving the Jews' Free School was his collaboration with his fellow pupil teacher Louis Cowen on the novel <span class="italic">The Premier and the Painter</span> (1888), published under the pseudonym J. Freeman Bell. It dealt with political rebellion and love and went into three editions by the end of the 1890s. Zangwill's first solo success, <span class="italic">The Bachelors' Club</span> (1891), was a sequence of short stories linked to appear as a novel, and introduced &#145;three central Zangwillian motifs: the irony of life, the fragility of idealism, and the utility of even delusive ideals&#146;  (Udelson, 74). Some of these stories, and of those later collected as <span class="italic">The Old Maids' Club</span> (1892), first appeared in <span class="italic">Ariel, or, The London Puck</span>, a comic journal edited by Zangwill which folded in February 1892. He also wrote for Jerome K. Jerome's <span class="italic">The Idler</span>&#151;the two had become friends at London University&#151;and Zangwill's <span class="italic">The Big Bow Mystery</span> (1891), with its non-Jewish settings and characters, appeared serially in the <span class="italic">London Star</span> (1891) and attracted a wide audience.<br>
<br>Notable among the myriad of miscellaneous articles Zangwill wrote, &#145;English Judaism: a criticism and a classification&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span>, 1, July 1899) consigned traditional Orthodox Judaism to the dustbin of history while also rejecting the new Reform Judaism:<blockquote>There is something touching and sublime in the common belief of a people in an apparent impossibility, in the ultimate return of its national hero, in the recovery of its golden glories &hellip; something pathetic in its simple faith and credulous hope, as a mother who clasps her dead child to her breast and will not let it go.</blockquote>Such apparent contradictions attracted the attentions of the backers of the newly founded Jewish Publication Society of America which commissioned him to write a Jewish novel. The result, <span class="italic">Children of the Ghetto</span> (1892), with its powerful realistic depiction of ghetto life, established Zangwill as a spokesperson for Jewry within and outside the Jewish world. His <span class="italic">Ghetto Tragedies</span> (1893), <span class="italic">The King of Schnorrers: Grotesques and Fantasies</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">Dreamers of the Ghetto</span> (1898) similarly presented the realities of Jewish ghetto life. <span class="italic">The Master</span> (1895) continues to explore immigrant life and the &#145;conflict between the demands of the artist's life and the moral values in which he was raised to believe&#146;  (Rochelson, 371), though this time using a non-Jewish setting split between Nova Scotia and London.<br>
<br>The year 1895 marked a watershed in Zangwill's personal life. At a reception he met Edith Ayrton (1875&#150;1945), the daughter of the distinguished electrical engineer and physicist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30509/', "William Edward Ayrton FRS (1847&#150;1908)")</script> and stepdaughter of Ayrton's second wife, also a distinguished physicist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37136/', "Phoebe Sarah (Hertha) Marks Ayrton (1854&#150;1923)")</script>. Edith's mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/949/', "Matilda Charlotte Chaplin Ayrton (1846&#150;1883)")</script>, one of the first women's medical doctors in Britain, had died in 1883 and Edith was brought up by Hertha, who was Jewish. Edith attended Bedford College, London University. Author of six novels, <span class="italic">Barbarous Babe</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The First Mrs Mollivar</span> (1905), <span class="italic">Teresa</span> (1909), <span class="italic">The Rise of a Star</span> (1918), <span class="italic">The Call</span> (1924), which focused on the emancipation cause, and <span class="italic">The House</span> (1928), she married Zangwill in a civil register office ceremony on 26 November 1903. Their marriage was a happy one, and they had three children: Ayrton Israel 
    (George; <i>b</i>. 1906)
  , who became an engineer and worked in Mexico; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39981/', "Oliver Louis Zangwill (1913&#150;1987)")</script>, who became professor of experimental psychology at the University of Cambridge (1952&#150;81); and Margaret (1910&#150;<i>c</i>.1990), who suffered from a mental condition and was institutionalized.<br>
<br>Zangwill became deeply involved with the Zionist cause, in its internal politics and infighting. He travelled widely, speaking and writing on its behalf. At the seventh Zionist conference in Basel in 1905 he made impassioned pleas to the delegates to accept the scheme to resettle Jews in east Africa: as he said, &#145;Palestine proper has already its inhabitants. &hellip; better Zionism without Zion than Zion without Zionism&#146;  (Udelson, 177). In the aftermath of the vicious pogroms raging in eastern Europe Zangwill, Theodor Herzl, and others were primarily concerned to rescue and resettle Jews anywhere, but these plans were rejected by various Zionist conferences. As Udelson summarizes: &#145;From 1901 to 1905 [Zangwill] was an advocate of official Herzlian Zionism; from 1905 to 1914 he was the driving force behind insurgent Territorialism; and from 1914 to 1919 he was the leading Western advocate of a Palestine-centred Jewish nationalism&#146;  (ibid., 164). Much of Zangwill's energy between 1905 and 1914 was devoted to the &#145;Galveston plan&#146;, which was supported by wealthy New York Jews of German origin and involved getting thousands of persecuted Jews out of eastern Europe and resettling them in the west and midwestern United States.<br>
<br>Ideological and personal rivalries caused Zangwill to break with the Balfour declaration of 2 November 1917. Initially he had supported this declaration of a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine, but he had come to believe that the Balfour declaration did not make adequate arrangements for the Arab populations there. At the 1919 Paris peace conference he advocated resettlement of these populations in a &#145;new and vast Arabian kingdom&#146;  (Udelson, 188). Disillusioned with what he regarded as British establishment duplicity and by internal dissension in Zionist politics, his last years were spent railing against those who he thought had betrayed his hopes for the future of the Jewish people and for the survival of their culture. In 1920 he wrote in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 16 January:<blockquote>What is now being concocted in Paris [that is, a League of Nations mandate] is a scheme without attraction save for mere refugees, a scheme under which a free-born Jew returning to Palestine would find himself under British military rule, aggravated by an Arab majority in civic affairs. (Udelson, 189)</blockquote>Zangwill was angular, tall, gaunt, and bespectacled, and was a witty, powerful and epigrammatic speaker who attracted large audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. In addition to his novels he translated the Hebrew liturgy into English and wrote poetry and twenty dramas&#151;many of which were adaptations from his novels. His most famous play was <span class="italic">The Melting Pot</span>, produced in Washington, DC in 1908, in New York in 1909, and in London in 1914. A political play, it advocates the message of tolerance and the assimilation of minority groups into the wider community. In <span class="italic">Too Much Money</span> (1918) he explores another of his favourite themes&#151;the corrupting power of wealth.<br>
<br>Broken in health, Zangwill spent his last years tended by his wife at their home in the Sussex countryside at Far End, East Preston. He died of pneumonia on 1 August 1926 at Oakhurst, a nursing home in Midhurst, Sussex. He was cremated at Willesden Green, London on 5 August, following a service conducted by the rabbi of the Liberal Jewish synagogue at St John's Wood, London. His ashes are at the Liberal Jewish cemetery, Willesden. His friend and contemporary Alfred Sutro observed that:<blockquote>under a somewhat truculent exterior he was curiously unselfish and tender-hearted. &hellip; A fiery spirit, a man who all his life followed a great idea, he was fitly apostrophized by Rabbi Wise in his funeral address &#145;Flame thou wert, to flame thou hast returned&#146;. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>
