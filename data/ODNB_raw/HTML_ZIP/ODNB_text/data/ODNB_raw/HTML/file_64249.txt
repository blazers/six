<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rogers,  Claude Maurice</span>  (1907&#150;1979), <span class="occ">painter and art teacher</span>, was born on 24 January 1907 at 28 Sutherland Avenue, Maida Vale, London, the elder son and eldest of the three children of David De Sola Rogers (<i>d</i>. 1920), dental surgeon, and his wife, (Rebecca) Ida, fifth daughter of Bernard Rubinstein of Maida Vale. His father's family were Sephardi Jews (the family name was probably an Anglicized version of Rodriguez), and his mother's family were Ashkenazim from Latvia. Rogers spent his first six years in Buenos Aires, where his chief memories of his father were the trinkets which he made out of dental gold, but thereafter he lived with his mother, who remained in London after the outbreak of war in 1914. He was educated at Colet Court, Kensington (1914&#150;19), Cheltenham Junior School for Boys (1919&#150;20), and St Paul's School, Hammersmith (1920&#150;25), and entered the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London, in 1925, after the painter Gerald Moira intervened to overcome his family's objections to painting as a profession. By the time he arrived at the Slade he already possessed a distinctive appearance and personality&#151;round-faced and bespectacled, short in stature, exuberantly fleshed, and legs stoutly astraddle, with a loud stamping gait and a high voice rising to a squeak when excited. With later additions of beard and pipe, these remained his salient features. His enthusiasm, affectionate joviality, and lively sense of humour made him many friends throughout his life, among them such Slade contemporaries as Rodrigo Moynihan and William Coldstream. Among many female friends at the Slade he met <a href="#cosubject_64249">Elsie Evelyn Few [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he married in 1937.<br>
<br>Rogers was one of Henry Tonks's star pupils, and he was awarded Slade scholarships in 1926 and 1927, obtained his certificate for drawing in 1926, won first prize for figure drawing in 1927, and prizes for landscape painting and figure composition in 1928 and 1929. On leaving the Slade he continued to paint, wandering around London making drawings and Sickertian oil sketches on which he worked further in a shed in his mother's garden. In 1930 he completed his first commission, obtained for him by Tonks&#151;a portrait of Sir Clive Coates and his family. He first exhibited with the London Group in 1930, and in 1931 was elected a member of the London Artists' Association, under whose auspices he held his first solo exhibition in 1933. Although for most of his life he used his own visual experience as subject matter for his paintings, for a short time in the 1930s he experimented with abstract art, showing work in the &#145;Objective abstraction&#146; exhibition at Zwemmer Gallery, London, in 1934. From 1935 to 1937 he became a part-time art-master at Raynes Park County School for Boys, Wimbledon, where his enthusiastic and eccentric teaching was admired. He continued to paint and in 1936 exhibited at the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>In 1937, with William Coldstream and Victor Pasmore, Rogers founded a school of drawing and painting in premises at 12 Fitzroy Street, London, and later at 314&#150;16 Euston Road. Many friends helped with the inception of the new school, which was unofficially christened the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64717/', "Euston Road School")</script> by Clive Bell when reviewing work by its members in the 1938 exhibition &#145;15 Paintings of London&#146;. Its prospectus emphasized that its chief discipline would be the observation of nature, with no preconceived idea of a final result, and the method of exploration would be measurement. Although the threat of war forced the school to close in 1939, its informal approach and serious purpose had an influence disproportionate to its brief existence. Rogers continued to paint through the early part of the war, in 1940 holding a successful solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London, where his painting <span class="italic">Mrs Richard Chilver</span> was bought through the Chantrey bequest for the Tate Gallery. He became an air raid warden, was appointed to St Pancras first aid post in 1940, and in March 1942 joined the Royal Engineers, becoming a corporal in 1943. Nobody could have been less suited to the army than Rogers, who was clumsy at all the drill and merely pined to paint. His attempts to become a war artist had resulted in only one commission, <span class="italic">The Wiring Party</span> (1942, in records of the Imperial War Museum, London). A nervous breakdown led to his exit from the army in August 1943, and in 1944 his son Crispin was born. He resumed painting with a series of remarkable still lifes&#151;<span class="italic">Still Life with Globe</span>, <span class="italic">Still Life with Cast</span>, and <span class="italic">Cast over the Mantelpiece</span> (1945, all priv. coll.)&#151;and landscapes such as <span class="italic">Clover Fields Near Toppesfield Church</span> (1946, priv. coll.) in which he combined rigorous observation and strong design with a new exuberance of colour. To help support his family he took part-time teaching jobs at St Martin's School of Art and at Hammersmith College of Art (1944&#150;5) and became a part-time painting tutor at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts (now Camberwell College of Arts) from 1944 to 1949. He also exhibited at the UNESCO exhibition in Paris in 1946, and in 1947 held a second solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries.<br>
<br>In 1949 Rogers became a visiting teacher at the Slade School of Fine Art, becoming a fine art assistant (1950) and lecturer (1955), later being recognized as a teacher of the university in the faculty of arts (1961). He continued to combine teaching with painting, exhibiting regularly in mixed shows and undertaking portrait commissions of notable academics, including <span class="italic">Professor Haldane</span> (University College, London), <span class="italic">Professor Tawney</span> (London School of Economics), and <span class="italic">Dame Janet Vaughan</span> (Somerville College, Oxford). In 1951 he was one of sixty British painters invited to contribute to the Arts Council's Festival of Britain exhibition, winning a purchase prize with his immaculately painted <span class="italic">Miss Lynn</span> (City Art Gallery, Southampton). A series of exceptional paintings followed, notably <span class="italic">The Hornby Train</span> (1951&#150;3, priv. coll.), <span class="italic">The Patient Opposite</span> (1952), and <span class="italic">The Blowlamp</span> (1953&#150;4, both Tate collection). His third solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in 1954 was followed by a retrospective show which toured to Bristol, Leicester, Manchester, and Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>Teaching and art administration gradually took up more of Rogers's time. In 1952 he became president of the London Group, a post which he held for thirteen years, and was co-opted onto the national committee of the International Association of the Plastic Arts created by UNESCO. He was a member of the art panel of the Arts Council (1955&#150;63), the Gulbenkian Foundation's advisory committee on art (1960), and the National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design and chairman of the fine arts panel (1961&#150;8). He was an influential teacher, whose obvious commitment to his subject and readiness to help his students tackle their problems in a practical way made him much in demand as a visiting tutor and examiner in many art schools throughout Britain. In 1959 he was appointed OBE, and was elected fellow of University College, London, in 1965. In 1963 he became professor of fine art at the University of Reading, retiring as professor emeritus in 1972. During these years he experimented with &#145;painting the unpaintable&#146;, fire and flight, in two long series of paintings of burning stubble fields and views from aeroplanes. Following his retirement, a major retrospective exhibition was held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, which toured to Birmingham, Bradford, Reading, Southampton, and Sheffield. Exhibitions at Fischer Fine Art Ltd, London, in 1975 and 1978 followed, at Gainsborough's House, Sudbury, in 1976, and in Harlow, Essex, in the month of his death. Rogers had been ill for some time with complications resulting from his diabetes (diagnosed in 1952) and had spent long spells in hospital in 1976. He died at his home at 36 Southwood Lane, Highgate, London, on 18 February 1979. At his funeral at Golders Green crematorium an address was given by Sir William Coldstream.<br>
<br>Claude Rogers clearly enjoyed his position as a painter, teacher, and administrator at the heart of the British art establishment. In this he was supported by his wife, <a name="cosubject_64249"></a><span class="headword">Elsie Evelyn Few</span>  (1909&#150;1980), also a <span class="occ">painter and teacher</span>, whose opinion he always respected. She was born on 4 February 1909 in Kingston, Jamaica, the eldest child of Jethro Few, drapery merchant, and his wife, Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Redwood White (<i>d</i>. 1919). She studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, and the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College, London (1928&#150;31) and, after some years of living abroad, returned to London and worked part-time at the Euston Road School. She was elected a member of the London Group in 1943, and after the war moved into education as art editor of a series of picture books for Chatto and Windus (1945&#150;8) and then as head of the art department at Gipsy Hill College of Further Education in south London (1949&#150;69). She combined painting with teaching, and for most of her life painted sensitive observations of nature. In 1970 she suffered a stroke and was paralysed on her right side. She trained herself to use her left hand and then embarked on a long series of collage works, helped by her husband. These were exhibited at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, in 1973. She died on 17 December 1980 in London. Her work is represented in many public and private collections, and the Tate collection owns her painting <span class="italic">Bradfields</span> (1947) and collage <span class="italic">Wrapping Paper</span> (1977).<br>
<br>Rogers and his wife had an enormous circle of friends whose work encompassed a wide range of attitudes and artistic allegiances. Rogers's own painting and teaching remained firmly committed to the figurative tradition which had come to England via France through the Camden Town painters. This did not prevent his appreciation of other influences, and he used his powers of appointment to promote many abstract artists. His importance as a teacher lay chiefly in the example he set as a working painter with exacting standards of his own. He perceived the history of painting as a progression in man's ability to depict and celebrate the visible world. He adhered to what he himself had learned, resisting fashions in art and relying on careful observation and representation of the odd realities of shape and colour and form which he perceived. His unusual painting motifs, particularly the intimate portraits of patients in hospital, are drawn from his own experience and combine a concern for visual truth with a painterly excitement and a warm humanity. His paintings are distinguished by an honest and plain-spoken realism in which delicate responses to observed fact and a sure sense of colour are assembled in solid and satisfying designs.<br>
