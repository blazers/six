<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whithorne,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1528&#150;1596), <span class="occ">composer and autobiographer</span>, was a son of John Whithorne and his wife, Joan, daughter of William Cabell, of Ilminster, Somerset. He was born in Somerset, probably in Ilminster, where the previous three generations of his family were settled; his sisters Joan, Margaret, and Agnes married Ilminster men. He was said to be aged sixteen in 1544 and forty in 1568, but sixty-two in 1596.<br>
<br>Whithorne's life and works to 1575 are recorded in &#145;A book of songs and sonnets, with long discourses set with them &hellip;&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. c. 330) written about 1576, in phonetic spelling, for an unknown friend. It is the earliest known continuous English autobiography. Some of its omitted names and places have been identified. It is the tale of unfortunate patrons and amorous women, and contains numerous verses (but no music), including a bawdy poem in broad Gloucestershire dialect, jests, and proverbs.<br>
<br>Whithorne studied in Oxford, at Magdalen College School (1538&#150;44) and at Magdalen College itself, as a demy (1545), but left without a degree. He moved to London to be employed as John Heywood's &#145;servant and scholar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1962, 6) for three years, and there learned to play the virginals and lute and to write poetry. On leaving Heywood, Whithorne hoped to teach music in London but found no openings in the metropolis (where he learned to play the cittern and gittern), so had to live in with country families. He declined an invitation to teach one of the duchess of Northumberland's daughters on the instruction of his then mistress. Thereafter he toured the continent to observe foreign customs. Whithorne's delight in Italian epigrams later found expression in a portrait of 1569, not hitherto identified. This half-length miniature shows a man inside a globular metal cage, a position evoking his own phrase, &#145;the spheres be the walls of music&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1962, 196). The accompanying motto, <i>So che io sono inteso</i>, has been translated as &#145;I know that I am in harmony&#146;  (Strong, 60).<br>
<br>Back home, Whithorne was in Lord Ambrose Dudley's service by 1557 and remained there until household economies forced him out. In 1560&#150;62 he was private tutor to William Bromfield's son William, who was then at Trinity College, Cambridge. On William's graduation, he and Whithorne went to London. Bromfield senior, having appointed Whithorne to manage his business affairs in London, left for Le Havre but died soon afterwards. Whithorne's health was poor, so again he took a country post. To further his career, he prepared earlier pieces for publication, and <span class="italic">Songes for Three, Fower, and Five Voyces</span> appeared in 1571. This collection consisted of secular songs for a wide range of abilities: these were, in effect, early madrigals. By about 1576 he had improved some verses and tunes.<br>
<br>Whithorne was appointed chapel master to Archbishop Matthew Parker, for whom he arranged two metrical psalms for four voices; he was in this post at the time of Parker's death in 1575. By 1577 Whithorne was living in the parish of St Alfege, London Wall. On 5 May of that year he married Elizabeth Stoughton in her parish church, St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. In 1582 he was assessed for the subsidy on a mere &pound;3, in St Mary Abchurch parish, where he finally settled.<br>
<br>Whithorne's <span class="italic">Duos, or, Songs for Two Voices</span>&#151;which in fact contains some pieces for voices and/or instruments&#151;was published in 1590. The verses of twenty of the fifty-two pieces had appeared in the autobiography, though they may have been written long before. Tipped into the autobiography was a scrap of paper listing early Tudor musicians (for example Robert Fayrfax, John Taverner) on one side, and later ones (including William Byrd, Giles Farnaby, and John Dowland) on the reverse.<br>
<br>Whithorne declared his nuncupative will on or about 5 July 1596: he bequeathed all his goods (unspecified) to his wife, Elizabeth, having no one else. He died quite soon afterwards, and was buried at St Mary Abchurch, on 2 August. In the event, his will was set aside, and administration was granted on 25 August of that year to his widow, who married Robert Souch at St Mary Abchurch on 18 October 1596.<br>
<br>Whithorne's autobiography makes interesting reading, though one could wish that he had been more expansive in certain particulars, as when castigating minstrels as &#145;the rascal and off-scum&#146; of the profession; mentioning the &#145;pretty, merry&#146; Neapolitan music; and stating that:<blockquote>
<div>I join th'English with the stranger, t'agree in music's trade,<br>
</div>
<div>So I the flats and sharps do set &hellip;<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1962, 203, 145, 146)</blockquote>Those of Whithorne's pieces which began as solo songs are suitably elaborate, whereas the music he composed for his own poems is very staid. His longer works are less restrained, though on occasion the contrapuntal aspects are overstretched, bringing imbalance, as Robert McQuillan argues in detail in his thesis of 1981 (see Osborn and McQuillan). However, his &#145;songs&#146; were the first English secular partbooks in print, while the &#145;duos&#146; were the earliest published duets; together they provide a pleasant introduction to Elizabethan middle-class music and song.<br>
