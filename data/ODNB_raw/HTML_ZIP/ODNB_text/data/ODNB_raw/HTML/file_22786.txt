<span class="headword">Prideaux,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1720?, <em>d.</em> 1759), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of Sir John Prideaux, sixth baronet (1695&#150;1766), of Netherton Hall, near Honiton, Devon, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1767), the eldest daughter of John Vaughan, first Viscount Lisburne. He was probably the John Prideaux baptized at Sutcombe, Devon, on 21 September 1720. On 17 July 1739 he was appointed ensign in the 3rd foot guards (later the Scots Guards); he was adjutant of his battalion at Dettingen (27 July 1743), and became lieutenant-colonel of his regiment on 24 February 1748. On 24 November 1746, at St George's, Mayfair, Westminster, he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Colonel Edward Rolt and the sister of Sir Edward Baytum-Rolt, bt, of Spy Park, Wiltshire; they had three sons and two daughters. She was described by a nineteenth-century descendant as &#145;a worldly, heartless, extravagant woman&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 8th ser., 9, 1896, 85) who played little part in her children's upbringing.<br>
<br>On 20 October 1758 Prideaux was appointed colonel of the 55th foot, in succession to George Augustus Howe, third Viscount Howe (1725?&#150;1758), killed at Ticonderoga. In 1759, during the Seven Years' War, William Pitt, the secretary of state, instructed General Jeffrey Amherst 
    (later Baron Amherst; 1717&#150;1797)
  , commander in America, that, while Wolfe attacked Quebec, attempts should be made to invade Canada via Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that at the same time he should undertake any other operations to weaken the enemy without detriment to the main task of the expedition. Amherst decided to attempt the capture of Fort Niagara, and entrusted the task to Prideaux, then brigadier-general, who had just arrived, appointing Sir William Johnson (1715&#150;1774) his second in command. Prideaux was to ascend the Mohawk River with 5000 troops, regulars and New York provincials, together with Native Americans drawn from the Five Nations under Johnson, to leave a strong garrison at Fort Stanwix, the great portage, descend the Onondega, leaving part of his force under Colonel Frederick Haldimand (1718&#150;1791) at Oswego, and to attack Niagara with the rest. Prideaux reached Oswego by the middle of June, rebuilt the fort, and on 1 July started for Niagara. Fort Niagara, on the site of a former post, was a strong modern fort, recently rebuilt by the French, commanded by Captain Pouchot, and garrisoned by part of the French regiment of B&eacute;arn. Prideaux arrived before it on 6 July 1759 and began siege operations. The British engineers were so incompetent&#151;a highland officer called them &#145;fools and blockheads&#146;  (Parkman, 448)&#151;that, to Prideaux's disgust, the first approaches were completely swept by the French fire and had to be constructed anew. On 19 July 1759 the batteries were ready. That morning Prideaux's force repelled a French vessel which attempted to land reinforcements, but in the afternoon Prideaux was struck on the head by a fragment of shell, which burst prematurely at the mouth of a British cohorn and instantly killed him. He was described by some writers as an unpopular officer. Colonel Eyre Massey 
    (later first Baron Clarina; 1719&#150;1804)
  , 46th regiment, the next senior regular officer, waived any claim to command in favour of Sir William Johnson, to whom the fort surrendered on 24 July 1759.<br>
<br>Since his elder brother, Sanderson Prideaux, a lieutenant in Colonel Moreton's marines, had died at Cartagena, Spain, in 1741, Prideaux's elder son, John Wilmot Prideaux (1748&#150;1826), became heir to the baronetcy, to which he succeeded, as seventh baronet, on his grandfather's death in August 1766; he was father (with his third wife) of the last two holders of the baronetcy, which became extinct in 1875 on the death of Sir Edward Prideaux, ninth baronet.<br>
<br>Prideaux had two daughters, Maria Constantia (<i>d</i>. in or before 1793) and Georgina Frances Anne, one of whom (although which is unknown) became an actress. She appeared first at Bath in October 1787, and played several times at the Haymarket or Drury Lane in London between 1788 and 1790, although never to any acclaim, and was discharged from the Drury Lane company in the 1791&#150;2 season.<br>
