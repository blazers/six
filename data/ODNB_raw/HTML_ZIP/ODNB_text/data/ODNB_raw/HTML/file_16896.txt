<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lampson,  Frederick  Locker-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Frederick Locker]</span>  (1821&#150;1895), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 29 May 1821 at the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, Kent, where his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16893/', "Edward Hawke Locker (1777&#150;1849)")</script>, held the office of civil commissioner, an appointment gained in part through Frederick's grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16895/', "William Locker")</script>, a naval captain and lieutenant-governor of the hospital from 1793. His mother, Eleanor Mary Elizabeth Boucher (1793&#150;1861), was the daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2972/', "Revd Jonathan Boucher")</script>, vicar of Epsom, Surrey, a book collector and a former friend of George Washington. Frederick was the third child, and a younger brother was the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16892/', "Arthur Locker (1828&#150;1893)")</script>. All were raised to revere their illustrious seafaring heritage, and were regaled with tales of Nelson over dinner, and surrounded by books and maps.<br>
<br>Frederick was sociable, if not quick&#151;at the age of nine he could not yet read&#151;so rather than attend Eton College, his father's school, he pursued a nondescript education at various schools&#151;at Clapham in London, at Yateley in Hampshire, at Greenwich, and elsewhere&#151;before becoming, on 18 September 1837, a junior clerk in a colonial broker's office in Mincing Lane in London. He followed this uncongenial calling for some years. Then, on 30 March 1841, he obtained from Lord Minto, first lord of the Admiralty and son of the governor-general of Bengal, a temporary clerkship in Somerset House. On 12 November 1842 he was transferred to the Admiralty, as a junior in Lord Haddington's private office, and he subsequently became deputy reader and pr&eacute;cis writer, which he enlivened by his ready wit and poetry. A rhyming version of a petition from an importunate lieutenant seems to have sent Lord Haddington into ecstasies, and Locker continued his career under Sir James Graham and Sir Charles Wood until ill health gained him a leave of absence on 23 May 1849, after which he toured the continent.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1850 Locker made a brilliant match in Paris with Lady Charlotte Christian Bruce (<i>d</i>. 1872), a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3759/', "Thomas Bruce, seventh earl of Elgin")</script>, who brought the Elgin marbles to England. Along with giving him an entr&eacute;e to royal circles&#151;he and his wife used to summer at Frogmore, as Lady Charlotte was friendly with Queen Victoria&#151;his marriage enabled him to quit government service, and in 1857 he published, with Chapman and Hall, his first collection of verse, <span class="italic">London Lyrics</span>, a small volume of ninety pages, which, under its various editions and revisions, constitutes his poetical legacy. Ironically, he had trouble having editors respond to his poetry, but he had an ally in Thackeray, who once told him &#145;I have a sixpenny talent (or gift), and so have you; ours is small-beer, but, you see, it is the right tap&#146;  (Locker-Lampson, <span class="italic">My Confidences</span>, 300). A second issue appeared in 1862, and in 1865 Moxon included a selection from its pages in <span class="italic">Miniature Poets</span>, illustrated by Richard Doyle. In 1868 another issue was privately printed for John Wilson of Great Russell Street, with a frontispiece by George Cruikshank. Eight further editions appeared between 1870 and 1893. In the United States <span class="italic">London Lyrics</span> was printed in 1883 for the Book Fellows' Club of New York, with some fresh illustrations by Randolph Caldecott; and in 1895 the Rowfant Club of Cleveland, Ohio, named from Locker's home in Sussex, put forth a rare little volume of his verse, chosen by Locker himself, entitled <span class="italic">Rowfant Rhymes</span>. The latter includes a preface by Austin Dobson and a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson. More reprints were put forward throughout the twentieth century, assuring Locker a place in England's literary history.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">London Lyrics</span> was not Locker's only work, and in 1867 he published the anthology <span class="italic">Lyra elegantiarum</span>, composed of specimens of <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i> and <i>vers d'occasion</i> gleaned from his ample experiences of high society. Although chronic ill health and dyspepsia made it impossible for him to follow any active calling, they did not prevent him from being a member of several clubs or enjoying the friendship of many distinguished people. Along with Thackeray, he was on intimate terms with Anthony Trollope, Tennyson, Lord Houghton, Lord Lytton, George Eliot, Dickens, Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Alexander William Kinglake, George Cruikshank, Alphonse de Lamartine, Franz Liszt, George Du Maurier, the royal family, and the shah of Persia, and he took great pains to see them introduced to his daughter Eleanor, who married Tennyson's son Lionel in 1878. In the meantime Lady Charlotte had died on 26 April 1872, and she was buried at Kensal Green. On 6 July 1874 Locker married his second wife, the children's writer Hannah Jane Lampson, the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15957/', "Sir Curtis Miranda Lampson, first baronet (1806&#150;1885)")</script>, of Rowfant, Sussex, and he took the Lampson name in order to succeed to the family estate in 1885. At this time his wife was a more prolific writer than Locker, who was caught up in <span class="italic">London Lyrics</span>, but he did publish <span class="italic">Patchwork</span> in 1879.<br>
<br>Locker's general characteristics are well summed up by his son-in-law, Augustine Birrell KC, who became his principal biographer. Birrell said that Locker was &#145;essentially a man of the world; he devoted his leisure hours to studying the various sides of human nature, and drawing the good that he could out of all sorts and conditions of men&#146;  (Birrell, appendix to <span class="italic">The Rowfant Library, a Catalogue</span>). As a poet he belonged to the school of Matthew Prior, Winthrop Mackworth Praed, and Thomas Hood. His chief endeavour, he said, was to avoid flatness and tedium, to cultivate directness and simplicity both in language and idea, and to preserve individuality without oddity or affectation. Thus, his work is always neat and clear, restrained in its art, and refined in its tone. Many of these characteristics may be glimpsed in the writings of his son, Godfrey Locker-Lampson, the eldest child of his second marriage. Oliver Locker-Lampson (1880&#150;1954), his second son, became a commander in the Royal Navy, a war hero, and a member of parliament.<br>
<br>Locker lived out his last years at his home, Rowfant, with his wife and children&#151;for along with Godfrey and Oliver he had two more children, his daughters Dorothy and Maud&#151;and it was for them that he wrote <span class="italic">My Confidences</span>, a mix of genealogy and reminiscences of famous people which was published by Birrell after Locker died. Birrell also put together a catalogue of his books, once known as the &#145;Rowfant library&#146;. The catalogue comprises, in addition to its record of rare Elizabethan and other volumes, many interesting personal and bibliographical memoranda which he had collected, along with his Louis XVI furniture, old masters, Chinese porcelain, and east Asian antiques. After Locker's death at Rowfant on 30 May 1895, an appendix to the <span class="italic">Rowfant Library</span> was issued, but the library itself was sold to an American bookseller in 1905 and dispersed.<br>
