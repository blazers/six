<span class="headword">Campbell,  Gordon Thomas Calthrop</span>, Baron Campbell of Croy  (1921&#150;2005), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born on 8 June 1921 in Quetta, India, one of two sons of Major-General James Alexander Campbell (1886&#150;1964), army officer, and his wife, Violet Constance Madeline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Calthrop (<i>d</i>. 1978), artist and writer. Educated at Wellington College and, at the outbreak of the Second World War, the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Campbell served briefly as an instructor, then with the 15th Scottish division. He was promoted captain at nineteen, and major at twenty-one. As the Germans retreated after D-day, he commanded the 320 field battery in the 15th Scottish division and became embroiled in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. Having earned the nickname Lucky following close shaves on the Siegfried line and in Normandy, he found himself on 29 April 1945 with one more river to cross, the mighty Elbe. Just minutes after his division set off in assault boats, a bullet smashed through Campbell, severing his sciatic nerve and disabling him for life. &#145;Here's another bloody Jerry!&#146;, shouted one of his rescuers as they carried him to a padre, failing to recognize Campbell beneath the blood and mud. &#145;That's not a bloody Jerry,&#146; replied the padre, having spotted his MC and bar, &#145;it's Major Gordon Campbell!&#146;  (<span class="italic">The News</span>, Nov 2002). He survived, unlike his brother Ian, a Spitfire pilot who was shot as an escaping prisoner in 1943 after baling out over Italy.<br>
<br>Campbell was flown back to Britain where he spent more than a year in hospital. He took the entrance examination for the Foreign Office while still on crutches, and began his diplomatic career with a desk job covering eastern Europe. He got to know the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, and would often wake him during the Berlin blockade to pass on telegrams. During this period the so-called &#145;Campbell solution&#146; was adopted over Trieste, marking the border between Italy and Yugoslavia. At the Foreign Office Campbell formed a close friendship with Anthony Montague Browne, later Churchill's last private secretary, who remembered Campbell being &#145;in pain a good deal of the time and partially disabled&#146; (his left leg was in a calliper), although it &#145;did not stop him being both remarkably efficient and the most jolly and humorous of companions&#146;  (Browne, 68&#150;9). Browne was Campbell's best man when on 21 July 1949, at St Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, he married Nicola Elizabeth Gina Madan, a 28-year-old Foreign Office colleague. She was the daughter of Captain Geoffrey Spencer Madan, and a descendant of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. They had two sons and one daughter. Shortly after his marriage Campbell was transferred to New York as part of the UK delegation to the United Nations. His regime of daily hospital care continued in the United States, and three years later he returned to London, first as Foreign Office liaison officer with MI5, MI6, and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and then as private secretary to the cabinet secretary, Sir Norman Brook.<br>
<br>It was apparently Brook who suggested Campbell to the former Conservative Scottish secretary James Stuart as the latter's successor in the Moray and Nairn constituency. He was duly adopted, resigned from a diplomatic posting in Vienna, and worked in the Conservative research department until the general election of 1959, when he was elected to parliament. After two years on the back benches he became a Scottish whip, and in 1963 joined the Scottish Office as parliamentary under-secretary for local government and housing. In opposition from 1964, he joined Edward Heath's front bench (despite voting for Reginald Maudling in the 1965 leadership contest) as a shadow defence spokesman before replacing Michael Noble (to whom Campbell's wife was also related) as shadow Scottish secretary in February 1969. He earned a reputation as a stickler, often contesting Hansard's grammatical corrections of his speeches.<br>
<br>In 1970 Campbell became secretary of state for Scotland in Heath's government, arriving at St Andrew's House to applause from civil servants, something that reportedly infuriated his predecessor (and successor) as Scottish secretary, Labour's Willie Ross. From Ross, Campbell inherited the report of a royal commission on local government in Scotland. He broadly supported its recommendation for two-tier local authorities, and stood firm despite opposition from Conservative activists fearful that a Strathclyde regional council would consolidate Labour dominance in the west of Scotland. Always uncomfortable with the political aspects of his cabinet post, Campbell also faced hostility because of his refusal to overrule Scottish councils that wanted to abolish selective schools. But there were some successes. The NHS in Scotland was overhauled through the creation of individual health boards, while Campbell was especially proud of fast-tracking construction of the A9 road. Industrial relations, however, were not so smooth. Campbell infuriated the Scottish Trades Union Congress when he described the upward trend of unemployment in Scotland as &#145;worrying, though not unexpected&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Feb 1972), while the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders forced Heath into a disastrous economic U-turn. Campbell also faced growing discontent over Heath's lack of commitment to a devolved Scottish assembly, a proposal that was not implemented despite a report from the Kilbrandon commission in October 1973. The Scottish National Party was then on the march with its compelling cry of &#145;It's Scotland's oil&#146;. Unfortunately for Campbell, voters in Moray and Nairn largely agreed and he was beaten by the Scottish Nationalist Winnie Ewing at the general election of February 1974 and jeered when, uncharacteristically, he claimed his defeat was a vote against the disabled. Campbell was unfailingly courteous, but what John Biffen remembered as &#145;an engaging lack of flamboyance&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 30 April 2005) did not serve him well as a politician and he was one of the weakest post-war Scottish secretaries.<br>
<br>Appointed to the House of Lords as Baron Campbell of Croy, he served as opposition spokesman in the upper house on Scottish affairs, and spoke on rather esoteric subjects reflecting his interests in ornithology and nature, including a campaign to exterminate the highland midge. More fruitful was his long campaign on behalf of disabled people. In the 1960s he had campaigned against discrimination and succeeded in strengthening the statutory duty of employers to provide access for disabled workers. He resumed his championship of the disabled after leaving the Commons. His work was recognized with the Nuffield Trust's first Queen Elizabeth, the queen mother, fellowship in 1980, after which he published <span class="italic">Disablement: Problems and Prospects in the UK</span> (1981). He also campaigned for greater understanding of schizophrenia.<br>
<br>Campbell was active in the upper house until the early years of the new millennium, but the constant travelling between his home in Nairnshire and parliament eventually took its toll. He moved, with his wife, to the St George's Nursing Home at 61 St George's Square, London, and died at St Thomas's Hospital, Lambeth, on 26 April 2005, of a pulmonary thrombo-embolism. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
