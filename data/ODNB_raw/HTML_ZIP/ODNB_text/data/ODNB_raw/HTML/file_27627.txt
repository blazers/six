<span class="headword">Townshend,  Hayward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1577&#150;1603<span class="mult">x</span>21), <span class="occ">parliamentary diarist</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Henry Townshend (1537?&#150;1621), second justice of Chester and a member of the council in the marches of Wales, and his wife, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1592), daughter of the prominent Londoner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37526/', "Sir Rowland Hayward")</script>. He was educated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1595, and he studied at Lincoln's Inn, being called to the bar in 1601. When he was elected to parliament in 1597 he became one of the youngest men to sit in the Elizabethan Commons. Then and in the 1601 parliament Townshend sat as MP for Bishop's Castle, Shropshire. Criticism of the royal granting of monopolies was voiced in both these parliaments. In 1601 Townshend proposed that the Commons petition the queen for permission to proceed against monopolies by statute, a suggestion that earned him the praise of Sir Francis Bacon. Townshend was an active participant in this parliament, offering his own, ultimately unsuccessful, measures on solicitors and perjury. He spoke eloquently and, on his own report, decisively, in favour of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company, which was seeking protection against encroachment of their trade by the Plasterers in 1601.<br>
<br>However, it is as a parliamentary diarist that Townshend has earned his reputation. He kept a relatively thin diary for 1597&#150;8, but any previous parliamentary journal is incomparable both in length and substance to his for 1601. The young MP was impressed by the opening and closing ceremonies and was particularly moved to record procedural discussions and matters of privilege. He was also a keen observer of detail, as in 1597 when he noticed that the clerk of the crown received the subsidy bill and &#145;laid it on a little table standing before the Speaker betwixt ii great wax candles one a plaine greene carpet&#146;  (Hartley, 3.241). Townshend often described bills fully and he recorded debates on a wide range of matters. However, it is his joy in the workings of the institution and his fascination with the persons around him that contributes much to modern understanding of an Elizabethan House of Commons. In 1597&#150;8 Townshend refers to those &#145;in the rebellioues corner in the right hand of the Howse&#146;  (ibid., 238) and to how MPs, having waited for thirty minutes to gain access to the closing ceremonies, rushed in with &#145;the greatest thrust and most disorder that ever I sawe&#146;  (ibid., 240&#150;41). Through Townshend it is known that one MP was upset in 1601 because a gentleman usher told those MPs standing outside the door of the House of Lords, trying to hear the lord keeper's speech, that &#145;yf they ware not quyett they should be sett in the stockes&#146;  (ibid., 310); that the house considered ordering a page, who had harassed an MP, to be taken to a barber to have his excessively long hair cut before being discharged, and that one morning, while waiting for the speaker's arrival, older MPs discussed how, in earlier days, special scaffolding had been required to accommodate fashionable breeches. Townshend gives important insights into the processes of lobbying, recording that one town &#145;openlie in the Howse canvased for voices and procured councellors to speake in the behalfe&#146; of their case in 1597&#150;8  (ibid., 240), and he reported that lists of monopolies circulated while the house debated the matter in 1601. His diary reveals the eloquence and influence of men such as Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Robert Cecil, and Sir Walter Ralegh.<br>
<br>Townshend was certainly dead by 2 April 1621, when his father drew up his own will, and it has been suggested that he died as early as 1603, on the grounds that such an active MP would hardly have failed to seek a seat for the 1604 parliament  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 517). He married Francasina (or Francelliana), illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19927/', "Edmund Neville")</script>, claimant to the earldom of Westmorland, and Franceline (or Francelliana), daughter of John Townshend of Dereham Abbey, Norfolk. Townshend's <span class="italic">Historical collections, or, An exact account of the proceedings of the four last parliaments of Queen Elizabeth of famous memory</span> was published in 1680.<br>
