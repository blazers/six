<span class="headword">Slaughter, Sir  William Capel</span>  (1857&#150;1917), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born at 9 Langton Place, Vassall Road, Kennington, London, on 11 May 1857 and was the sixth and youngest child, and second son, of Mihill Slaughter (<i>d</i>. 1880), the secretary of the railways' department of the stock exchange, and his wife, Ann Erskine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Capel. Little is known about the kind of education the Slaughter children received; the biographical notes that survive suggest that he was educated privately, a euphemism of the period suggesting education at home by a governess or tutor. He did not attend university and his legal training, common at the time, was a five-year period as an articled clerk to a solicitor. Slaughter was articled to the firm of Benjamin Gay Wilkinson and George Bernard Harvey Drew in Bermondsey Street. Although he learned the fundamentals of law with this firm, it did no commercial work, and Slaughter's first professional exposure to the field of work in which he would make his name occurred in 1879 when he joined the leading firm of solicitors Ashurst Morris Crisp &amp; Co. Here John Morris, a highly respected commercial lawyer, became his mentor.<br>
<br>In 1880 Slaughter's father died and he left &pound;40,000 to be divided among his children, his wife having predeceased him. This gave him a degree of financial security, and together with his legal work enabled him to marry, on 22 September 1881, Ida Mabel (1855/6&#150;1889), daughter of Loraine Wearer, a surgeon. The couple produced four children between 1882 and 1887, two sons and two daughters, although one daughter died of meningitis aged eighteen months. Shortly after his marriage Slaughter was made a freeman of the Clothworkers' Company.<br>
<br>In 1887 Slaughter left Ashurst Morris Crisp to set up his own practice. By an agreement with Morris, Slaughter continued to handle the affairs of some of his clients as agent of Ashurst Morris Crisp but the rest Slaughter was able to keep as his own. It appears that in addition Slaughter had clients who were unrelated to his work for the firm, but acquired mainly through family connections. It was also at this time that Slaughter began his connection with William May, who had also undertaken his articles at Ashurst Morris Crisp. By the end of 1888 they had decided to go into partnership together. On 1 January 1889 they opened a joint bank account and the legal firm of Slaughter and May was established. Shortly afterwards Slaughter's wife Ida died, leaving him with three small children, but his sister Mary stepped in to look after the children and the household, allowing Slaughter to concentrate on his legal practice. On 9 December 1899 he married his second wife, Hester Mary (<i>b</i>. 1867/8), daughter of William Duff Bruce, a civil engineer and vice-chairman of the port of Calcutta; they had one son.<br>
<br>Slaughter's pre-eminence in the legal world arose through his legal knowledge and practical experience of finance and commerce. It was said that there was no man in the City whose advice was valued more on any complicated question of law and finance: &#145;Ten minutes' consultation with him was worth more than an hour with most men. His brain worked with extraordinary rapidity, and with a fine sense of proportion&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 13 March 1917). His experience of business was vast, typified by his long connection with the Home and Colonial Stores (a highly successful chain of low-cost but good-quality food retailers), whose founding partner, Julius Charles Drew (formerly Drewe) was his sister's brother-in-law. Slaughter became chairman of Home and Colonial Stores in 1888 and remained so until his death in 1917. He reconstructed the company in 1893 so as to facilitate its expansion, and in 1895 the company was reconstituted again, this time with a capital of &pound;100,000. Although a managing director was appointed in 1899, Slaughter continued his detailed involvement with the company, remaining its primary negotiator with suppliers.<br>
<br>Slaughter's high profile and reputation as a businessman prompted his appointment to the royal commission on sugar supplies, established in August 1914 under the chairmanship of Reginald McKenna. The commission had a mandate to &#145;purchase, sell, and control the delivery of sugar on behalf of the government&#146;, and it was one of the first examples of central control over food resources, a matter which became more prevalent as the war progressed. Slaughter gave &#145;arduous assistance&#146; to the commission and other government departments, especially the Board of Trade, and was rewarded by the king with a knighthood in the birthday honours list of 1915.<br>
<br>Slaughter appears to have had few interests outside law and business. He founded Kingsgate Golf Club on the Kent coast in the first decade of the twentieth century but it is not known whether he played, although the Sir William Capel Slaughter cup was played for at the club for many years after his death.<br>
<br>Slaughter had always made great demands upon himself and by the middle of the war these were beginning to take their toll. He had suffered bouts of illness since the 1890s, not surprisingly, given that a contemporary described him as working &#145;unremittingly, allowing no rest by night or day&#146;  (Dennett, 145). The end, however, was brought about by cancer: in 1916 he was diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the prostate, and was very ill by Christmas. He died on 10 March 1917 at his London home, 3 Berkeley House, Hay Hill, Mayfair, after a stroke had sent him into a coma, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Slaughter was typical of the breed of Victorian solicitors familiar with business yet determined to create and maintain professional respect for the solicitors' profession. Many such solicitors fell victim to the recession of the late 1890s, but those that survived did so with an enhanced professional reputation. At the time of his death, Slaughter and May was established as one of the leading commercial firms, a position that it has retained up to the present day and for which it owes much to its original founder.<br>
