<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walker,  George</span>  (1734?&#150;1807), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and mathematician</span>, was born at Newcastle upon Tyne. At the age of ten he was placed in the care of his uncle at Durham, Thomas Walker (<i>d</i>. 1763), who was successively minister at Cockermouth (1732), Durham (1736), and Leeds (1748). He attended the Durham grammar school under Richard Dongworth. In autumn 1749 he was admitted to the dissenting academy at Kendal under Caleb Rotherham; here, among the lay students, he met his lifelong friend John Manning (1730&#150;1806). On Rotherham's retirement in 1751 he was for a short time a pupil of Hugh Moises at Newcastle upon Tyne. In November 1751 he entered at Edinburgh University with Manning, where he studied mathematics under Matthew Stewart, who interested him in that subject. He moved to Glasgow University in 1752 to attend divinity lectures of William Leechman; he continued his mathematical studies under Robert Simson and heard the lectures of Adam Smith, but learned more from all three in their private conversation than their public performances. Among his contemporaries at Glasgow were Newcome Cappe, Nicholas Clayton, and John Millar (1735&#150;1801), members with him of a college debating society. After leaving Glasgow in 1754 without graduating, he did occasional preaching at Newcastle and Leeds, and injured his health by excessive study; at Glasgow he had allowed himself only three hours' sleep. He apparently recovered through a course of sea bathing. In 1756, while seeking to become what he himself termed the &#145;spiritual consul&#146; to &#145;any presbyterian tribe&#146;  (Walker, xxxi), he declined an invitation to succeed Robert Andrews as minister of Platt Lane Chapel, Manchester, partly on financial grounds: the salary was only &pound;40 p.a. But later in that year he accepted a call (in succession to Joseph Wilkinson) to serve his uncle's former congregation, at Durham, and was ordained there in 1757.<br>
<br>At Durham, Walker finished, but did not immediately publish, his <span class="italic">Doctrine of the Sphere</span>, begun in Edinburgh. With the signature P. M. D. (presbyterian minister, Durham) he contributed to the <span class="italic">Ladies' Diary</span> a collection of mathematical papers, published in serial form and edited by Thomas Simpson (1710&#150;1761). He left Durham at the beginning of 1762 to become minister at Filby, Norfolk, and assistant to John Whiteside (<i>d</i>. 1784) at Great Yarmouth. Here he resumed his friendship with Manning, who was by then practising as a physician at Norwich. He began a treatise on conic sections, inspired by Isaac Newton's <span class="italic">Arithmetica universalis</span> of 1707. He took pupils in mathematics and navigation. Through Richard Price he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1772 was recommended to William Petty, second earl of Shelburne (afterwards first marquess of Lansdowne), for the post of his librarian, subsequently filled by Joseph Priestley. He declined it owing to his approaching marriage in that year, when he also became mathematical tutor at Warrington Academy in succession to John Holt (<i>d</i>. 1772). Here Walker prepared his treatise on the sphere for publication, himself cutting out all the illustrative figures, of which there were 20,000, for an edition of 500 copies. It appeared in quarto in 1775, and was reissued in 1777. Joseph Johnson gave him for the copyright &pound;40, remitted by Walker on finding the publisher had lost money.<br>
<br>The emoluments at Warrington did not answer Walker's expectations, and he resigned in two years, becoming colleague to John Simpson (1746&#150;1812) at High Pavement Chapel, Nottingham, in autumn 1774. Here he remained for twenty-four years and devoted himself to congregational and political work. He made his mark as a pulpit orator, reconciled a division in his congregation, founded a charity school in 1788, and published a hymnbook. In conjunction with Gilbert Wakefield, the controversialist and classical scholar, he formed a literary club, meeting weekly at the members' houses. Wakefield described him as possessing &#145;the greatest variety of knowledge, with the most masculine understanding&#146; of any man he ever knew  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Gilbert Wakefield</span>, ed. J. T. Rutt and A. Wainewright, 2 vols., 1804, 1.227). Nottingham was a focus of political opinion, which Walker led both by special sermons and by drafting petitions and addresses sent forward by the town in 1775 in favour of the independence of the United States and the advocacy of parliamentary reform (1782) and religious liberalization (1789&#150;90). His ability and his whiggish constitutional opinions won the high commendation of Edmund Burke. His reform speech at the county meeting at Mansfield on 28 October 1782 led William Henry Cavendish Cavendish-Bentinck, third duke of Portland, to compare him with Cicero, to the disadvantage of the latter. From 1787 Walker was chairman of the associated dissenters of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and part of Yorkshire, an organization aiming to achieve the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Acts</span> and secure religious liberty for Unitarians. His <span class="italic">Dissenters' Plea</span> (n.d. [1790]) was praised by Charles James Fox as the best publication on the subject. He was an early advocate of the abolition of the slave trade. The variety of his interests is shown by his publication in 1794 of his treatise on conic sections, while he was agitating against government measures for the suppression of public opinion which culminated in the <span class="roman">&#145;Gagging Act&#146;</span> of 1795.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1797 Walker was invited to succeed Thomas Barnes as professor of theology in Manchester College. Feeling it a duty to comply, he resigned his Nottingham charge on 5 May 1798. There was one other tutor, but the funds were low, and Walker's appeal in April 1799 for increased subscriptions met with little response. From 1800 the entire burden of teaching, including classics and mathematics, fell on him, with no increase of salary. In addition he served the congregation at Dob Lane Chapel, Failsworth, from 1801 to 1803. Samuel Pipe-Wolferstan, whose son Stanley studied under Walker at Manchester, recorded in his diary that Walker was overworked and embroiled in financial disputes with the college trustees. He resigned in 1803, and the college was moved to York.<br>
<br>Walker remained for two years in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and continued to take an active part in its Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he was elected president on the death of Thomas Percival (1740&#150;1804). In 1805 he moved to Wavertree, near Liverpool, still keeping up a connection with Manchester. In the spring of 1807 he went to London on a publishing errand. His health declined suddenly, and he died at Draper Hall, London, on 21 April 1807. He was buried in Bunhill Fields. His only son, George Walker, his biographer and author of <span class="italic">Letters to a Friend</span> (1843) on his reasons for nonconformity, became a resident in France. His only daughter, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1854), married on 9 July 1795 Sir George Cayley, bt, of Brompton, near Scarborough.<br>
<br>Walker's theology, which he described as a &#145;tempered Arianism&#146;, plays a considerable part in his own compositions, and also shows itself in omissions and alterations in his <span class="italic">Collection of Psalms and Hymns</span> (1788). James Tayler, in a funeral sermon, described him as &#145;averse to &hellip; contradiction&#146; and prone in controversy to &#145;an unbecoming warmth of expression&#146;. As J. E. Bradley has shown, Walker was an important figure in late eighteenth-century English radicalism and his controversial writing endured for longer than that of most of his contemporaries.<br>
