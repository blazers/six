<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dobson, Sir  Roy Hardy</span>  (1891&#150;1968), <span class="occ">aircraft manufacturer</span>, was born at Horsforth, Yorkshire, on 27 September 1891, the eldest child of Horace Dobson, farmer, and his wife, Mary Ann Hardy. He became an engineering apprentice with T. and R. Lees, a firm then operating in Hollinwood, near Manchester. He joined the company of A. V. Roe, aeroplane manufacturer, in 1914, becoming its works manager in 1919 and general manager in 1934. He was elected to the board of the company in 1936 and became managing director in 1941, retaining that position until he became in 1958 managing director of the Hawker Siddeley Group Ltd, a company of which A. V. Roe had become a subsidiary in 1935, and to which Dobson was appointed a director in 1944.<br>
<br>The increasing possibility of war in the late thirties gave Dobson an opportunity to develop his talents to the full. During the 1930s A. V. Roe had been engaged in the design of a twin-engined bomber aircraft, the Manchester, which suffered from underpowered and unreliable engines and seemed bound to fail. At the time, the Merlin engine, developed by Rolls-Royce, was designed to be used in fighter aircraft. Roy Chadwick, then chief designer at A. V. Roe, felt that if he could redesign the twin-engined Manchester using four of the Merlins, he might overcome the problems. This was a proposal which the authorities were loath to accept, if only because they felt that the need for fighters would absorb as many Merlins as could be provided. Dobson faced this problem with characteristic vigour. Somehow four Merlins were obtained and speedily fitted into the Manchester prototype. From this work emerged the Lancaster, which was undoubtedly the most successful bomber developed by either side in the war. Dobson's ability to procure such a new and vital weapon displayed to the full his energy, determination, and imagination.<br>
<br>With similar vigour Dobson initiated and supervised the provision of resources to manufacture this aeroplane in quantity for Hawker Siddeley in Canada, as he was also doing in English factories. In Canada, however, he was starting from the beginning, and he created a factory which produced an excellent product in large numbers. An aero-engine factory was set up at the same time. At the end of the war Dobson arranged the purchase by Hawker Siddeley of both the aeroplane and engine units. At this time he set up A. V. Roe Canada Ltd, and Orenda Engines Ltd, as design and manufacturing organizations. He was the first president of these companies and later, in 1951, became their chairman. Their first product was a successful military aircraft, the Avro CF100, powered by an engine (the Orenda) designed and built by Orenda Engines. The Canadian company also built a prototype jet-propelled civil aircraft which was almost certainly the first jet civil machine to fly. It was slightly ahead of the Comet, designed by De Havilland in England, although it did not enter passenger service, as did the Comet, which therefore became the first jet-propelled aircraft to carry commercial passengers.<br>
<br>Under Dobson's chairmanship, A. V. Roe Canada proceeded from these successes to design and build, in conjunction with the Canadian government, prototypes of a very advanced fighting aircraft which became known as the Arrow. In retrospect it can be seen that this very costly venture was probably beyond the financial resources of a country with the small population then possessed by Canada, and the Arrow, although technically successful, was cancelled in a storm of controversy. Dobson, perhaps sensing that there were limits to the investment which Canada could make alone in military development, had already extended the business of A. V. Roe Canada into other areas, particularly railway engineering in which he made a series of company acquisitions. He had many associates in Canada, a country for which he had great affection, and was a director of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (1955&#150;66).<br>
<br>Despite his heavy responsibilities in Canada, Dobson continued to develop his interests in England. After the war A. V. Roe designed and built the revolutionary delta-winged Vulcan bomber and entered the civil aviation field with the Avro 748, which enjoyed a long production run. As a director and managing director of the Hawker Siddeley Group, and subsequently its chairman (1963&#150;7), Dobson did much to widen the company's aeronautical interests, particularly in the early 1960s, when he initiated the acquisition of the De Havilland, Blackburn, and Folland companies, so forming, with the existing Hawker Siddeley aviation interests, a strong aeronautical unit which eventually became Hawker Siddeley Aviation Ltd. Simultaneously he initiated early moves to bring the company into areas of engineering other than aeronautics. He retired from his chairmanship in 1967 at the age of seventy-five.<br>
<br>Dobson&#151;known the world over as Dobbie&#151;was a man of great vigour and imagination, with a drive and determination which enabled him to make a definitive impact on the development of industry and particularly the aeronautical industry. He was warm-hearted and enthusiastic, if sometimes a little hard on others in his outbursts of anger when things went wrong, but always immediately contrite if he had been too harsh. He was apt, from time to time, to address people in somewhat heightened language, but never to an extent greater than he would readily apply to himself if he concluded that the fault was really his own. He was a colourful man with a tremendous capacity for hard work and for overcoming difficulties. He gathered around him others whose devotion to him increased the more he drove them, although not without the occasional casualty.<br>
<br>Dobson was created CBE in 1942, was knighted in 1945, and was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1956. In 1916 he married Annie Smith (<i>d</i>. 1954). They had two sons, one of whom was killed in a flying accident in 1946, and a daughter. He died at King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, Sussex, on 7 July 1968.<br>
