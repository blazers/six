</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Phillips, Sir  Tom Spencer Vaughan</span>  (1888&#150;1941), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 19 February 1888 at Pendennis Castle, Falmouth, Cornwall, the son of Colonel T. V. W. Phillips, Royal Artillery, and his wife, Louisa May Adeline, the daughter of Admiral Sir Algernon F. R. de Horsey. At fifteen he entered the training ship <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet in a distinguished year that was to see six of the class eventually reach flag rank.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Phillips was known for his intelligence from the outset and duly satisfied his examiners at every turn: he was appointed midshipman in 1904, sub-lieutenant in 1907, and, after gaining the maximum five first-class certificates, lieutenant in July 1908. He decided to specialize in navigation and saw service in the First World War, initially as navigator of the cruiser HMS <i>Bacchante</i> during the Dardanelles operation. Although he sought more excitement, his next posting was as navigator on the more modern cruiser HMS <i>Lancaster</i>, stationed well out of the action in the Far East. Disappointed that he was denied the opportunity to participate more fully in the war, Phillips none the less worked hard and prospered. Benefiting from an unexpected vacancy, he was given the rank of acting commander and became the executive officer of the <i>Lancaster</i> from April 1917 onwards. In the following year he was made acting captain and commanded the ship for three months before being transferred to the cruiser HMS <i>Euryalus</i> in early 1919 so that he could bring her back to the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>In the same year Phillips married Gladys Metcalfe, the daughter of Captain F. G. Griffith-Griffin and the widow of J. H. Brownrigg. It was a highly successful partnership, not least because they were able to spend far more time ashore together than was usual within the service. They were to have one son who, perhaps not surprisingly, decided to follow his eminent father into the Royal Navy.<br>
<br>Although he was widely respected for the quality of his mind, it has to be admitted that Tom Phillips was not the most popular leader of men ever to go to sea. Lacking the common touch and a sense of humour, he was generally considered to be aloof, disdainful, impatient, intolerant, and dismissive of those whose opinions he did not value. Being utterly self-confident, he was often both assertive and dogmatic in portraying his views on matters both large and small. Nicknamed Tom Thumb and Titch Phillips because of his slight physical stature&#151;he was no taller than 5 foot 2 inches in height and roughly 57 kilos in weight&#151;Phillips was sallow in complexion and often looked exhausted. Apart from his love of chocolate, which he ate more or less permanently, he had few foibles. An intense individual who could rarely relax and whose hobbies were limited, Phillips was essentially a compulsive workaholic and a person disinclined to delegate authority to even those subordinates with ability. Senior officers could depend upon him, however, and his knack of working harmoniously with even the most difficult of them showed a diplomatic side to him that his critics rarely concede. He lived for his work and he set his staff exacting standards of professionalism that often proved impossible for others less gifted or less driven than him to match. Difficult though he could be to work for, he inspired a real sense of loyalty from those of his staff who spent much time with him.<br>
<br>Phillips's career took off after the war. He attended the first Staff College course and was duly noticed by the authorities as an officer to watch. Thereafter he served for three years on the staff of the British naval representative at the League of Nations, and was promoted to the rank of commander in June 1921. After his stint in Geneva, he worked in the plans division of the Admiralty for a further two-year period of staff work. Late in 1924 he was sent back to sea in command of the sloop HMS <i>Verbena</i> on the Africa station. Eight months later he was appointed to the operational staff of the Mediterranean Fleet serving under Admiral Sir Roger Keyes and working closely with his chief of staff, Dudley Pound, whose firm friendship he gained and never lost. Phillips remained in the Mediterranean until May 1928 and was promoted captain in June 1927. His next appointment was in command of the sixth destroyer flotilla for nineteen months from September 1928, whereupon he returned to the plans division as assistant director. It was a very fraught period, coinciding with the onset of the great depression and the withering effects of severe financial economies in public expenditure that culminated in the tragic Invergordon mutiny in September 1931. A year later he left Admiralty House once more to take command of HMS <i>Hawkins</i>, the flagship of the East Indies squadron, and remained in that post until January 1935.<br>
<br>After his shore leave he returned once more to Whitehall as director of plans. He held this post from August 1935 to April 1938 at a time of increasing tension in both Europe and the Far East. As the British government grappled with the problem of imperial overstretch and remained committed, at least on paper, to the &#145;Singapore strategy&#146; with wholly inadequate naval resources at its disposal, Phillips was brought into the planning circle that Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, formed to find alternative ways of dealing with these very considerable potential threats to the United Kingdom's democratic existence. Eden, no firm believer in appeasement, felt that the only effective answer lay in involving the Americans in some form of naval co-operation against the Japanese in the Pacific. To this end a top-secret meeting between Captain Royal E. Ingersoll, the American navy's representative, and Tom Phillips took place in the Admiralty in early January 1938. Unfortunately, the Ingersoll&#150;Phillips conversations were rather anticlimactic in nature and their inconclusive results did much to scuttle Eden's plans for coping with the Japanese menace. Eden's alternative to appeasement had therefore failed to materialize and so the strategic mess that the United Kingdom found itself in remained unresolved.<br>
<br>After leaving Admiralty House in the month after the <i>Anschluss</i> had been arranged between Germany and Austria, Phillips was appointed commodore of the Home Fleet destroyer flotillas. It was not a sinecurial appointment. In the early hours of 25 September 1938, in foul weather on passage from Rosyth to Scapa Flow, one of Phillips's destroyers, <i>Encounter</i>, managed to collide with the aircraft-carrier HMS <i>Furious</i>. Although no board of inquiry was held into this incident and therefore no blame was attached to him, it certainly did not add any lustre to Phillips's reputation within the navy as a whole. He was seen essentially as a very competent staff officer rather than a naturally gifted ship-handler. When he reached flag rank in January 1939, his critics commented wryly upon his good connections. These were certainly in evidence in the summer of 1939 when he was asked by Dudley Pound, the newly appointed first sea lord, to become his deputy chief of the naval staff. This meant yet another lengthy spell in London and away from any form of naval action on the high seas, yet it was also an extraordinary offer that simply could not be refused. Usually, this level of appointment would be filled by someone of vice-admiral rank. Phillips was some years shy of such a rank, but Pound had no qualms about his ability to do the job. His assessment proved to be correct. Phillips and Pound formed a wonderful working relationship with one another. Complete trust was established between the two of them from the outset and Phillips's abilities and work ethic soon won over the rest of the naval staff and his political masters as well. His sharp, penetrating intellect and calm, unruffled demeanour were qualities much appreciated by Churchill, who consulted him on numerous questions and enjoyed his company and frequently invited him to spend the weekend at Chequers after May 1940. By then Churchill had recommended that he be given the acting rank of vice-admiral in February 1940 and the first lord's hand could also be seen in Phillips's redesignation as vice-chief of the naval staff two months later. Whatever the value of his advice may have been to the former first lord, the same independence of spirit exhibited by Phillips in criticizing policies that Churchill advocated, namely, retaliatory bombing of German cities (September 1940) and the diversion of troops and supplies from north Africa to Greece (April 1941), eventually alienated the prime minister and the two men rarely spoke thereafter. Aware of the estrangement, Albert Alexander, the Labour MP who became first lord of the Admiralty in May 1940, did not hold it against Phillips, whom he came to rely upon for the same type of analytical shrewdness that his predecessor had valued.<h2>
<a name="CommanderinchiefEasternFleet"></a>Commander-in-chief, Eastern Fleet</h2>Wishing to go back to sea after his period as vice chief of the naval staff was completed, Phillips learned in May 1941 that he was to become the commander-in-chief of the as yet unformed Eastern Fleet. This was another controversial appointment that rankled with many of his fellow officers, not least because he would receive a double promotion to acting admiral. Quite apart from the favouritism that they felt had once more been shown to him, his critics complained that he did not have the requisite amount of command experience at sea to hold down such a post, let alone in wartime. At the time and even subsequently there was much debate over the composition of the fleet that Phillips would command. While these details were being worked out, he remained in the Admiralty until October 1941, when he was finally ordered to the River Clyde in order to pick up his flagship, the modern battleship HMS <i>Prince of Wales</i>, and take her out to South Africa in the first instance and further east if circumstances warranted it.<br>
<br>It is evident that Phillips was perturbed about the magnitude of the task that faced his fledgeling Eastern Fleet. As someone who had been involved in the evolution of the &#145;Singapore strategy&#146; almost from its inception, Phillips did not need reminding that this version of it was only a pale shadow of the massive force first envisaged by the Admiralty planners in the early 1920s. Lacking an aircraft-carrier&#151;the HMS <i>Indomitable</i> had run aground in the Caribbean&#151;the newly constituted Force G led by the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, though still not properly worked up, left the Clyde on 25 October with the destroyers <i>Electra</i> and <i>Express</i> and would rendezvous with the old battle cruiser HMS <i>Repulse</i> and two further destroyers, <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Encounter</i>, in Colombo. Before crossing the Indian Ocean, however, Phillips, on Churchill's orders, had flown to see Field Marshal Jan Smuts, the South African prime minister, in Pretoria. Impressed though Smuts was with Phillips, he was deeply concerned that the Eastern Fleet, far from being a deterrent to the Japanese, might prove to be an irresistible temptation to them. Phillips was painfully aware that if the Eastern Fleet was to be an important fleet-in-being it must be augmented as quickly as possible with other heavy units and fighter protection. While Phillips was a late convert to the effectiveness of air power, it is also evident that he still regarded the battleship, properly handled and screened, as capable of wielding the most destructive power of any military unit at sea.<br>
<br>As soon as the <i>Prince of Wales</i> had reached Ceylon, Phillips was ordered by the Admiralty to fly to Singapore on 29 November in order to hold planning discussions with the British military commanders on the island. This left the 53-year-old W. G. Tennant, the immensely popular captain of the <i>Repulse</i>, to bring Force G into Singapore on 2 December amid much fanfare and acclaim from the local press and populace. Phillips formally took command of the Eastern Fleet on 3 December and next day flew off to Manila to confer with Admiral Hart, the commander-in-chief of the American Asiatic fleet, about the possibilities of gaining naval reinforcements for his Eastern Fleet from both the American and Dutch naval commands. While he remained in the Philippines, he ordered the <i>Repulse</i> to steam to Port Darwin to &#145;show the flag&#146; in the hope that it might encourage the Australian government to release at least a cruiser to supplement his force in Singapore.<br>
<br>In the afternoon of 6 December, however, even before the <i>Repulse</i> had reached Darwin and Phillips had concluded his conversations with Hart, ominous news arrived indicating that three separate convoys of Japanese transports, totalling thirty-eight ships in all and flanked by strong naval escorts, had been spotted off the southern coast of French Indo-China steaming in the direction of the Gulf of Siam. While no declaration of war had been issued as yet by the military authorities in Tokyo, their aggressive intentions were palpably clear. Ironically, just when the time to act had arrived Phillips was in no position to respond. If he could have sent his capital ships to wreak havoc on the intensely vulnerable Japanese transports as they were landing their troops either on the coast of southern Thailand or north-eastern Malaya, the imperial Japanese army's invasion of Malaya could have been seriously disrupted. As it was, however, neither Phillips nor the <i>Repulse</i> was on hand to do anything about this intelligence report, and to make matters worse&#151;if that was possible&#151;the <i>Prince of Wales</i> was in no condition to sally forth immediately to engage the enemy since she was having her boilers overhauled. It would be a further two full days before Phillips could take his ships to sea.<br>
<br>By then, of course, the guessing game was over as the Japanese had already begun landing their troops at Singora, Patani, and Kota Bahru, had bombed both Singapore and the allied air bases throughout the Malayan peninsula, and had created havoc with the American Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Since the Admiralty did not issue him with any instructions about what to do with his ships in this new and hostile environment&#151;a grievous omission if ever there was one&#151;and he refrained from requesting any such advice, Phillips was left to ponder the very few practical options open to him. Given that his ships could not remain undetected and unharmed for long in Singapore, a retreat to Australia, Ceylon, or the Dutch East Indies was indeed possible if he wished to pursue the fleet-in-being concept, even though such a move was bound to be considered morally indefensible by those fighting for their very lives in Malaya at this time. Steeped in naval tradition, Phillips appears to have felt that there was no realistic alternative but to take his ships, now to be known as force Z, into the South China Sea to do some belated damage to the amphibious operation that the Japanese had launched in the early hours of 8 December. Quite how long he expected the Japanese to take in landing their troops on the Thai and Malayan coasts is unclear, but one imagines that he hoped that the north-easterly monsoon would have inhibited these movements in a significant way. Unfortunately, the vital adjunct to any search and destroy mission&#151;air power&#151;was unlikely to be available to him in significant strength for the duration of his sortie. It was essential, therefore, that force Z, shorn of its aerial cover, should remain undetected by either Japanese submarines or aircraft on its outward journey so that it could arrive unexpectedly off the invasion beaches and inflict maximum damage to the Japanese cause before escaping at high speed southward. Whether it was wisdom, or sheer folly, for Phillips to sail &#145;to the sound of the guns&#146; has been debated ever since this ill-starred operation left the Johore Strait in the late afternoon of 8 December, but few would disagree that it was a bold and courageous act and in keeping with the best traditions of the Royal Navy.<h2>
<a name="DestructionofforceZ"></a>Destruction of force Z</h2>Sadly, force Z, consisting of his two capital ships and four destroyers of mixed vintage and ability, the modern and fast <i>Electra</i> and <i>Express</i> and the ancient and slow <i>Tenedos</i> and <i>Vampire</i>, was not to remain undetected for long. Despite taking an indirect route to the Gulf of Siam to avoid both a likely Japanese minefield and submarine flotilla and obscured by heavy cloud and poor visibility, force Z was still spotted at 1345 hours on 9 December by submarine <i>I-65</i> some 100 miles north of the Anambas Islands. Unaware that force Z had been detected, Phillips pressed on northward but just over three hours later the skies suddenly cleared and at about 1740 hours three Japanese seaplanes emerged on the horizon and shadowed the two British capital ships until dusk fell. Phillips realized that the game was up and that any chance of striking a decisive blow against the Japanese transports had evaporated. All that remained for him to do was to escape from the enemy dragnet that was certain to be mounted against his ships from that time forward. He altered course twice under cover of darkness before aborting the original operation and setting course for a return to Singapore at 2015 hours. As midnight approached a signal was received on the <i>Prince of Wales</i> from Rear-Admiral Palliser, Phillips's chief of staff in Singapore, reporting an enemy landing at Kuantan, a town roughly half-way along the east coast of Malaya and less than 200 miles from Singapore. Phillips was a stickler for observing radio silence once an operation had begun and he did not contact Palliser for confirmation that this report was correct. (It proved, alas, to be false.) Even so, such a landing would make perfect sense for an invasion force because once a bridgehead had been established the Japanese could then make use of a good existing arterial road system to cut off the allied troops operating in the north of the country and accelerate their own progress against those pitted against them in the southern state of Johore and on the island of Singapore. Thus the danger to be apprehended from making a diversion to Kuantan was worthwhile and Phillips had few qualms about doing so. Whether Phillips expected Palliser to send fighter cover for force Z at Kuantan is unknown, but he did not break radio silence to request it. For his part, Palliser was blissfully unaware of Phillips's actual position or indeed whether he intended to follow up the as yet unconfirmed report about the landing at Kuantan.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly, when force Z reached Kuantan at 0800 hours on 10 December the ships found themselves alone. Moreover, all was quiet on the Pahang shoreline. Despite the fact that there was no sign of any invasion and the weather was bright and clear, Phillips proceeded to waste more than two hours scouring the seas off Kuantan for what was a non-existent invasion fleet. He could not have been oblivious to the vulnerability of force Z, but even so he was still engaged in this futile investigation when his ships were eventually spotted by a Japanese reconnaissance plane at 1015 hours. At this point Phillips had nothing to lose by breaking radio silence and requesting Singapore to send all available aircraft to protect force Z as it sped home, since the Japanese now knew where it was and were sure to attack it. Amazingly, no such request was ever transmitted from the <i>Prince of Wales</i>. Decades later the seminal question of why Phillips continued to maintain radio silence at this stage remains unanswered. Although there has been much conjecture from numerous quarters, no definitive evidence has ever been unearthed to solve this tragic conundrum. In the final analysis, however, it is doubtful whether the limited force of ageing Brewster Buffaloes available to the allies in Singapore would have made any material difference to the eventual outcome even if they had been covering force Z over the South China Sea at this time.<br>
<br>Away from the realms of speculation, the Japanese aircrews were ruthlessly efficient in dispatching force Z. From the time that they located the British ships and began their high-level bombing (at 1113 hours) to the successive waves of torpedo attacks that finally finished off the <i>Repulse</i> (1233 hours) and <i>Prince of Wales</i> (1320 hours), the degree of co-ordination and courage shown by them was impressive, as was the heroic resistance put up by the crews of the two doomed capital ships. In the end, however, force Z was overwhelmed by hostile forces. It was a sobering lesson for the traditionalists within the Royal Navy to learn, for it graphically demonstrated that the age and supremacy of the battleship had passed.<br>
<br>Tom Phillips had the opportunity to save himself before his ship sank but he chose not to. He was one of the 840 officers and men of force Z who lost their lives as a result of this naval disaster in the South China Sea on that fateful day, 10 December 1941. His wife survived him.<br>
