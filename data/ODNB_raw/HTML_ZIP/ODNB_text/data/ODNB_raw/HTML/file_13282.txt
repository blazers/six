<span class="headword">Hill,  John Harwood</span>  (1809&#150;1886), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and topographer</span>, son of Robert Hill of Lincoln and Leamington, and his wife, Mary, was born at Louth, Lincolnshire, and baptized there on 3 October 1809. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13294/', "Robert Gardiner Hill (1811&#150;1878)")</script> was a younger brother. On 30 June 1830 he was admitted a pensioner of Peterhouse, Cambridge. His marriage on 8 December 1833 to Maria Ann Jiggins (1815&#150;1874) brought them a large family, including John Daniel Hill, staff surgeon to the Royal Free Hospital, London. <br>
<br>In 1834 Hill graduated BA, was ordained deacon at Carlisle, and became curate of Glaston, Rutland. The following year he was ordained priest at Peterborough and moved to become curate of Corby, Northamptonshire, and librarian to Lord Cardigan at Deene. He compiled a black-letter catalogue of the Deene library, with etchings of his own. In 1837 he was appointed by Lord Cardigan rector of Cranoe, and by the lord chancellor in 1841 vicar of Welham, both near Market Harborough, Leicestershire. In August 1846 the church at Cranoe was badly damaged in a storm and through Hill's efforts a new church was built in 1849 by subscription. The church at Welham was also restored during his incumbency and in 1838 the rectory at Cranoe was rebuilt, largely at his expense. Hill was appointed surrogate for the diocese of Peterborough in 1852.<br>
<br>Hill was author of several works, of which the earliest was <span class="italic">The chronicle of the Christian ages, or, Record of events ecclesiastical, civil, and military to the end of 1858</span> (1859). His <span class="italic">History of the Hundred of Gartree</span> was published in two parts: <span class="italic">The History of the Parish of Langton</span> (1867), which was originally designed to raise funds for the rebuilding of the church at Tur Langton, and <span class="italic">The History of Market Harborough</span> (1875); both volumes included several other parishes and were illustrated with Hill's own etchings. Hill was the local secretary of the Leicestershire Architectural and Archaeological Society and contributed some seventeen articles to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span> on a wide variety of local history and genealogical subjects. He was also a corresponding member of the Royal Archaeological Institute. On 12 January 1871 he was elected FSA. He died at Cranoe rectory on 3 December 1886 and was survived by Sarah (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1848), his second wife. He was buried in Cranoe churchyard.<br>
