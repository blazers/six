<span class="headword">Treswell,  Ralph</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1616/17), <span class="occ">painter&#150;stainer and surveyor</span>, was the son of Robert Treswell, alias Baker, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Margaret Langley. His date of birth is not known, but the first reference to him at work is 1567&#150;8, and he may therefore have been born about 1540. He was by trade a painter&#150;stainer, a craft which in 1581 included face painters, history painters, arms (heraldic) painters, and house painters; Treswell was probably an arms painter, for he painted streamers and banners for several London companies. He must have become a fairly senior member of his own company, since he was one of the receiving trustees of Painter&#150;Stainers' Hall in 1580, and one of those releasing the hall to others in 1605. He married three times. His first wife was Cicely Cresley, with whom he had three sons: Robert, who became Somerset herald in 1597, Ralph (also a surveyor), and Christopher. His second wife was Anne Kentish, and his third Elizabeth Bachelor.<br>
<br>From at least 1580 Treswell was also drawing pictorial surveys, all of rural estates. These included estates in Northamptonshire of Sir Christopher Hatton, and lands of London institutions such as St Bartholomew's Hospital, Christ's Hospital (of which he was a governor from 1604 to his death), and the Clothworkers' and Leathersellers' companies. Other clients for single surveys included Magdalen College and Christ Church, Oxford. From at least 1607 he also drew up plans of properties in London to accompany leases of Christ's Hospital. In 1610&#150;11 the hospital, and in 1612 the Clothworkers' Company, decided to obtain a comprehensive survey of their London estates. Both these surveys have survived, and they provide an important and unique view of housing conditions in the city before the great fire of 1666.<br>
<br>Treswell, like other heraldic painters, transferred his skills to map making to meet the increasing demand for estate plans in the vigorous property market after the dissolution of the monasteries and the Reformation. Being in London, he could exploit both the court and the merchant community as patrons, and would have been exposed to the new developments in surveying in the published works of Leonard and Thomas Digges and others. He thus became one of the first modern land surveyors.<br>
<br>From 1583 Treswell took part in the administration of Aldersgate ward in the city of London, where he lived; from 1606 he was the ward's senior common councilman. He died intestate between July 1616 and March 1617.<br>
