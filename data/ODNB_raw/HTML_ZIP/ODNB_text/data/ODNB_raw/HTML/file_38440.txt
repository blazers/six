<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sutcliffe,  Francis Meadow <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1853&#150;1941), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 6 October 1853 at Headingley, Leeds, Yorkshire, the eldest son of the painter Thomas Sutcliffe (1828&#150;1871) and his wife, Sarah Lorentia Button (<i>d</i>. 1915). Thomas Sutcliffe attempted to establish a career as a watercolour painter selling to Yorkshire patrons, but he died young; after an elementary education at a dame-school, his son Frank tried to support the family by taking up the relatively new technology of photography. By this time the family was living on the Yorkshire coast near Whitby, a town with which Sutcliffe's name and work was to become inextricably linked.<br>
<br>Frank Sutcliffe was one of the first generation of practitioners to take on photography and to devote a lifetime to investigating its potential. His work demonstrates photography's role as a direct, expressive medium through which he was able to convey his vision of the life of ordinary people and the landscape in which he lived and worked. In this he was very different from many earlier photographers who had often been businessmen looking for new openings or painters seeking ways of making a living in a changing world. He resented the fact that he had to make his living as a portrait photographer, working first in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and then for over half a century in Whitby. His father had brought him into contact with prominent men in the art world including John Ruskin, whom Sutcliffe visited and photographed at his home, Brantwood, in 1873. Throughout his career he nurtured higher ambitions, though he was also a shrewd and hard-working businessman and was routinely in touch with the successful commercial photographers of the day, such as Francis Frith. Thus Sutcliffe led a double life, taking portraits of holidaymakers during the summer season and producing photographs for himself which were exhibited and admired around the world. His work was shown at and won prizes in exhibitions from London to Chicago and Tokyo; prints made from his negatives have been on sale to visitors to the Yorkshire coast, and more widely, for over 120 years.<br>
<br>Sutcliffe's business in his Skinner Street studio rooted him to Whitby and Eskdale, but what seemed to him initially to be a severe disadvantage actually proved an immense strength in his work. He left the most complete and revealing photographic record of a late Victorian town and the people who lived there. Not only was he a superb photographer, but he was known by everyone in the community, who co-operated with him in photographing the everyday life of the area, its fishing activities, and the changing seasons. His most famous photograph, entitled <span class="italic">Water Rats</span> and taken in 1886, shows the misty east side of Whitby, with young boys playing by a boat in the harbour water. There was some contemporary comment from locals concerning the indecency of photographing naked boys (who were, moreover, on the run from the truancy officer), but the image is hardly erotic. It is probably best interpreted as a realist image filtered through a high art lens: Sutcliffe was clearly experimenting with the traditional conventions of the academic nude in an attempt to illustrate how photography could reach to the level of art.<br>
<br>Sutcliffe's misty landscapes, with the sun breaking through the sea fret and figures in the foreground set against hazy backgrounds, were early examples of naturalistic photography of the kind promoted by P. H. Emerson. In both his photography and his writing, Sutcliffe showed an awareness of the techniques and the ideas of other visual artists, such as the French painter Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet. His work embodied a sophisticated approach previously seen in painting, combined with the strength of the direct recording powers of the camera. His style and subject matter were much admired and much copied, and he was one of the photographers asked by Kodak to demonstrate the potential of their new snapshot cameras, including panoramic cameras.<br>
<br>Sutcliffe married a woman from a local family, Eliza Weatherill Duck (<i>b</i>. 1847/8), the daughter of a bootmaker, on 1 January 1875 and brought up one son and three daughters in Sleights, near Whitby, where he built himself a substantial house on the proceeds of his photographic business. A prolific writer on photographic subjects, he contributed to the <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span>, the <span class="italic">Photographic Journal</span>, and many other periodicals. For over twenty years he wrote a photography column in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Weekly Post</span>. In 1922 he retired from photography to become the curator of the Whitby Museum, and in 1935 he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. Frank Sutcliffe died at his home in Carr Hill Lane, Sleights, on 31 May 1941 and was buried in the churchyard at Aislaby, overlooking the Esk valley. His work is in the collection of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society in the Whitby Museum, and in national collections such as the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in Bradford.<br>
