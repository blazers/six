<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilde, Sir  William Robert Wills</span>  (1815&#150;1876), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born at Kilkeevin, near Castlereagh, co. Roscommon, the youngest of the three sons and two daughters of a prominent local medical practitioner, Thomas Wills Wilde, and his wife, Amelia (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1844), daughter of John Fynn. From his family background and schooling in Roscommon&#151;the Royal School at Banagher and the Church of Ireland diocesan school at Elphin&#151;Wilde acquired an idealized if scholarly devotion to the folk traditions and topography of the west of Ireland. His introduction to surgery came from accompanying his father on his rural rounds. In 1832, however, Wilde was bound as an apprentice to Abraham Colles, the pre-eminent Irish surgeon of the day, at Dr Steevens' Hospital in Dublin. He was also taught by the surgeons James Cusack and Sir Philip Crampton and the physician Sir Henry Marsh. Wilde also studied at the private and highly respected school of anatomy, medicine, and surgery in Park Street (later Lincoln Place), Dublin. Wilde's close and significant friendships with the physicians Robert Graves and William Stokes came about as a result of his being taught by Graves at Park Street. He completed his Dublin training with a year's midwifery at the Rotunda Hospital under Evory Kennedy, where he won the annual prize examination with a treatise on spina bifida.<br>
<br>A collapse in health preceded Wilde's appointment as a licentiate of the college of surgeons in March 1837. For either reasons of health or as a consequence of his having fathered a child out of wedlock, his mentors arranged for him to absent himself temporarily from Dublin in September of that year to travel as surgeon to a consumptive Glasgow merchant bound for Madeira and the Levant on the steam yacht <i>Crusader</i>. The numerous cases of ophthalmic trachoma Wilde encountered on the streets of Alexandria and Cairo were decisive for his later orientation towards eye surgery. The notes on the climate, natural history, topography, and state of medicine in the places he visited were later published as the two-volume <span class="italic">Narrative of a Voyage to Madeira, Teneriffe and Along the Shores of the Mediterranean</span> (1840). This work, which became known popularly as Wilde's <span class="italic">Voyage</span>, established him as a Dublin savant and led to him becoming a regular contributor to, and close associate of, the editorial coterie behind the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>. It also introduced Wilde to the &#145;gentlemen of science&#146; who made up the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). His attendance at its 1839 Birmingham meeting marked the start of a long and fruitful association with the natural history and anthropological sections of the BAAS.<br>
<br>The &pound;250 fee Wilde received for <span class="italic">Voyage</span> allowed him to extend his medical education by a period of study abroad, first in London for three months in 1839 at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital (Moorfields) and the Hunterian Museum, and then at the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in Vienna. At Moorfields his teachers were John Dalrymple, Frederick Tyrell, and George Guthrie. He also made the acquaintance of Richard Owen, the Hunterian professor of comparative anatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons. His London circle included Queen Victoria's physician Sir James Clark, his fellow Dublin expatriate, the surgeon and later founder of King's College Hospital, Robert Bentley Todd, and Sarah Lee, illustrator and author of <span class="italic">Memoirs of Baron Cuvier</span> (1833) and numerous works of travel, African exploration, and natural history. Through the novelist Maria Edgeworth, Wilde was brought into London literary society. Although Wilde had gone to Vienna primarily to extend his knowledge of ophthalmic and aural surgery he quickly discovered that the latter was as neglected by the Allgemeines Krankenhaus as it was by Moorfields. With the treatment of eye disease, however, he followed a six-month course on practical surgery in the Viennese medical faculty, which in 1812 had established a chair and clinic of ophthalmology. Here Wilde observed the clinical and teaching practices of Anton Rosas (1791&#150;1855), the second holder of the ophthalmology chair, and Friedrich Jaeger (1784&#150;1871), professor of ophthalmology at the Joseph's academy, where surgeons were trained for service in the imperial army. Vienna also afforded him access to Josef Skoda (1805&#150;1881), renowned for his diagnosis of diseases of the chest, and the pathological anatomist Karl Rokitansky (1804&#150;1878).<br>
<br>From Vienna, Wilde travelled to Munich, and from there to Prague, Dresden, and Heidelberg, where he attended the university for several months as an independent scholar before to going to Berlin to study at the clinic of Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792&#150;1847), founder of plastic surgery. The letters of introduction he carried from Maria Edgeworth were a passport to the political and intellectual &eacute;lites, most notably to the Berlin Geographical Society, at which he read a paper on Irish ethnology and which brought him to the attention of Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#150;1859).<br>
<br>Wilde returned to Dublin in 1841 to open a practice as an eye and ear specialist from his home at 15 Westland Row. As his practice grew he moved in 1848 to 21 Westland Row, and then in 1855 to 1 Merrion Square. On 12 November 1851, in St Peter's Church, Dublin, he married the poet and critic Jane Francesca, known as Speranza (1821&#150;1896) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29398/', "Wilde, Jane Francesca Agnes")</script>], the daughter of the Dublin attorney Charles Elgee (1783&#150;1824) and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of the Revd Thomas Kingsbury LLD, of Lisle House, Dublin. They had two sons, the barrister and later journalist William Charles Kingsbury Wills (1852&#150;1899) and the writer, critic, and journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29400/', "Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde")</script>, and a daughter, Isola Francesca (1857&#150;1867). Wilde also fathered three illegitimate children, one of whom, a son whom he called Henry Wilson (<i>c</i>.1838&#150;1877), a name thought to have been a play on &#145;Wil(de's) son&#146;, was trained by his father as an oculist. Wilson was the author of <span class="italic">Lectures on the Theory and Practice of the Ophthalmoscope</span> (1868), and, after Wilde's death, succeeded him as senior surgeon to St Mark's Hospital for Diseases of the Eye and Ear. Wilde's two other natural children, Emily (1847&#150;1871) and Mary (1849&#150;1871), were adopted as wards by his eldest brother, the Revd Ralph Wilde.<br>
<br>Wilde established in Dublin a specialist eye and ear hospital modelled on Moorfields but including aural practice. He acquired the lease of a disused stable on South Frederick Lane, off Molesworth Street, and converted it into a dispensary for treating the eye and ear complaints of the poor of Dublin. The reputation he quickly acquired from the popularity of his dispensary both enhanced his private practice and led to his being appointed lecturer in ophthalmology and otology at the Park Street school. Wilde's dispensary paid for itself through monthly subscriptions from each of his patients, but further expansion into the treatment of in-patients and the development of teaching required a larger building. In 1844 Wilde purchased the building on Mark Street that had formerly housed a general hospital. As St Mark's Hospital and Dispensary for Diseases of the Eye and Ear this became the first hospital in the British Isles to teach aural surgery, and the first in Ireland to combine treatment of the eye with that of the ear. Funded partly from a realization of the assets of the former general hospital, partly from a grant from the Dublin grand jury, and partly from private subscriptions, it appointed Robert Graves as consultant physician and Sir Philip Crampton as consultant surgeon. Its success was such that it soon outgrew the Mark Street building. The closing of the Park Street school in 1848 provided Wilde with a timely opportunity for further expansion. He bought the building for &pound;1100 and put &pound;200 into structural work, which enabled it to become a hospital for twenty public patients, with three private rooms, outpatient facilities, an operating theatre, a lecture room, and rooms for a resident surgeon. In 1862 Wilde formally delegated the management of St Mark's as a voluntary hospital to a board of trustees to safeguard its facilities for the poor of Ireland. It merged in 1897 with the National Eye and Ear Infirmary to form the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, on Adelaide Road.<br>
<br>Under Wilde's direction St Mark's became a centre for research and teaching in ophthalmic and aural practice. Wilde followed the continental teaching techniques of clinical instruction at the patient's bedside in what was effectively a specialist teaching hospital. As a surgeon he followed the methodology of the schools of Paris and Vienna in seeking to apply to surgery the localized insights offered by pathological anatomy. He was a regular attender of the Saturday afternoon meetings of the Dublin Pathological Society. Wilde's <span class="italic">Observations on Aural Surgery and the Nature and Treatment of Diseases of the Ear</span> (1853) drew on the wealth of detailed clinical case reports he had amassed at St Mark's. It was also the first textbook to provide practitioners with a reliable nosology and pathology for scientific diagnosis and treatment. The book, in which Wilde classified ear diseases by pathology rather than symptomatology, was bitterly attacked in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> by Wilhelm Kramer, who advocated the older symptomatological classification. The attack was supported by <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>'s editor, who said that the reviewer had &#145;consigned [Wilde's] book to the trunkmakers&#146;. Nevertheless, in 1853 the appointment of surgeon oculist-in-ordinary to the queen in Ireland was conferred on him.<br>
<br>Wilde's bedside investigations were crucial in establishing the role of the tympanic membrane and the middle ear in aural infections. Wilde introduced into Irish medical practice the unsplit ear speculum designed by the Viennese otologist Ignaz Gruber (1803&#150;1872) for examination of the tympanic membrane. He also developed the first dressing forceps specifically for use with the ear, an aural snare, and a new incision to be used in the surgical treatment of mastoiditis. As &#145;Wilde's snare&#146; and &#145;Wilde's incision&#146;, these became the first otological additions to the existing stock of Irish medical eponyms.<br>
<br>In his other specialism, eye surgery, Wilde was a keen proponent of the use of atrophine in the treatment of corneal ulcer and cataracts. He followed Jaeger's technique for the removal of cataracts by upward incision, and performed numerous operations to relieve squint by tenotomy, cutting and then stitching to divide the internal rictus muscle of the eye. He regarded the granulations of ophthalmic trachoma as the most frequent cause of blindness in Ireland and believed it was the same condition he had seen in Egypt. He independently (with Thomas Wharton Jones, a London ophthalmologist, confirmed the cause of astigmatism as being the asymmetry of the cornea. Wilde shared with many of his contemporaries an ambiguity about anaesthetics, though he did support the use of chloroform for plastic operations on the face and the tear ducts.<br>
<br>In 1843 Wilde initiated an extended series of clinical communications in the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal of Medical Science</span>, questioning received medical opinion on eye and ear surgery and issues of public health. Having added the word <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> to its title when he became editor in 1845, he used the journal to campaign vigorously on behalf of his profession, publishing as an open letter the 1847 attack by Robert Graves on the central board of health for the inadequacy of the financial provision it had made for doctors involved in famine work. In <span class="italic">Medico-legal observations upon infantile leucorrhea, arising out of the alleged cases of felonious assaults on young children, recently tried in Dublin</span> (1854), he argued that leucorrhea in minors was not necessarily associated with venereal infection and did not therefore provide conclusive proof of sexual assault; <span class="italic">On the Physical, Moral, and Social Condition of the Deaf and Dumb</span> (1854) drew on the statistics he had compiled from the 1851 Irish census. These represented the first attempt anywhere in Europe to classify the total number of persons in a given geographical area suffering from disease, either permanent or temporary, on a given day.<br>
<br>In the 1850s Wilde also enjoyed lucrative part-time employment in the emergent life-insurance industry, in his case as medical referee for the Victoria Assurance Company. He was an early member of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, and in 1844 he had instituted at St Mark's an annual series of hospital reports distinguished by their level of statistical detail. The statistical abilities he had demonstrated in his book <span class="italic">Austria: its Literary, Scientific and Medical Institutions</span> (1843) drew him to the attention of the organizers of the material collected in the 1841 census of Ireland and led to his appointment as medical adviser and compiler of the table of deaths for the census report. He went on to become assistant commissioner for the censuses of 1851, 1861, and 1871, service which earned him a knighthood in 1864.<br>
<br>Wilde viewed the Irish countryside as a national asset which was threatened by famine, emigration, and education. His early writing on this topic was to have been expanded into a &#145;History of Irish medicine and popular cures&#146;, but this remained uncompleted at the time of his death. Some of the material he had assembled was published in his <span class="italic">Irish Popular Superstitions</span> (1852) and, posthumously, in Lady Wilde's <span class="italic">Ancient Cures, Charms and Usages of Ireland</span> (1887). Through his wife and her contributions to <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, Wilde was linked to the nationalist politics of Young Ireland; he himself was a quasi-nationalist, and in his final years looked favourably on Isaac Butt's campaign for Irish home government. Wilde became part of the inner circles of the Royal Irish Academy, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Celtic Society of Dublin. The first volume of his <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogue of the Antiquities &hellip; in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy</span> (3 vols., 1857&#150;62) was published to coincide with the association's meeting in Dublin in 1857. At its 1874 meeting in Belfast, Wilde gave an address entitled &#145;On the ancient races of Ireland&#146;. Other publications reflected his interests in natural history and travel. In 1849 he also published <span class="italic">The Closing Years of Dean Swift's Life</span>, one of the earliest refutations of Swift's insanity.<br>
<br>Wilde's reputation became tarnished by scandal. Mary Travers, a long-term patient of his and the daughter of a colleague, had for some time been engaged in an increasingly public campaign of harassment against Wilde, claiming that he had seduced her. This culminated in her writing, and then distributing outside the building where Wilde was about to give a public lecture, a pamphlet crudely parodying himself and Lady Wilde as Dr and Mrs Quilp, and portraying Dr Quilp as the rapist of a female patient anaesthetized under chloroform. Lady Wilde complained to Mary's father, Robert Travers, which resulted in Mary bringing a libel case against her. Mary Travers won her case but was awarded a mere farthing in damages by the jury. The case, however, was the talk of all Dublin. Wilde's refusal to enter the witness box during the trial was widely held against him as ungentlemanly behaviour and provided his fellow oculist and medical editor Arthur Jacob with a further opportunity publicly to campaign against the man he had earlier accused of rapacity as a gentlemanly entrepreneur of surgery.<br>
<br>From this time onwards Wilde began to withdraw from Dublin to the west of Ireland, where he had started in 1864 to build what became Moytura, his house overlooking Lough Corrib in Connemara. His declining health and persistent and prolonged bouts of depression during much of that time were exacerbated by deaths of his daughter Isola from fever in 1867, and of his natural daughters Emily and Mary in a fire in 1871. Moreover, the trial cost Wilde dear, with costs of &pound;2000 awarded against his wife, and this may have started the downward spiral which left his family in virtual penury after his death. Wilde returned to Dublin to die on 19 April 1876 at 1 Merrion Square surrounded by his family, and, Oscar Wilde later recalled, a former lover who sat with Lady Wilde's permission, shrouded in a veil at his bedside. He was buried three days later in the Church of Ireland cemetery of Mount Jerome in Harold's Cross, Dublin.<br>
