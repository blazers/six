<span class="headword">Boyle,  Constance Antonina <span class="st"> [Nina]</span></span>  (1865&#150;1943), <span class="occ">women's rights campaigner</span>, was born in Bexley, Kent, on 21 December 1865, the second daughter and fifth of the six children of Robert Boyle (1830&#150;1869), great-grandson of the second earl of Glasgow and a captain in the Royal Artillery, and his wife, Frances Sydney Fremoult Sankey (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of Francis Fremoult Sankey MD. Little is known about her early life or education.<br>
<br>About the turn of the century Nina Boyle spent several years in South Africa, including performing hospital duty during the South African War, in which two of her brothers also served. She also worked as a journalist, and during this time commenced her activism for women's rights, founding the Women's Enfranchisement League of Johannesburg. After returning to Britain in 1911, she became active in the Women's Freedom League (WFL), which had been formed in 1907 after a split within the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) over autocratic control by the Pankhursts, and which adopted civil disobedience and propaganda tactics in preference to the occasionally more violent methods used by the WSPU.<br>
<br>Boyle became head of the WFL's political and militant department in 1912. She wrote extensively for <span class="italic">The Vote</span> (the journal of the WFL) and took a leading role in the league's campaigns and numerous demonstrations. She was arrested on several occasions and imprisoned three times. Partly as a means of improving the treatment of women by the police&#151;particularly given her own experiences&#151;and also as part of the WFL's aim to make all employment areas open to women, Boyle attempted to gain approval for women to be employed as special constables. When this was officially refused, in the autumn of 1914 Boyle, with Margaret Damer Dawson of the National Vigilance Association, established the first voluntary women's police force, the Women's Volunteer Police Corps (WVP). The WVP represented also an attempt within the women's movement to begin to challenge male control of the law&#151;particularly in regard to sexual matters. In correspondence with Asquith in 1914, Boyle complained in regard to the possible revival of the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Act</span> that it was unjust that male officers should police laws that were &#145;almost exclusively concerned with matters in which women are involved to a greater extent than men&#146;  (Levine, 57). But it was the policing of such matters that led to divisions within the WVP. From the first the corps had acted at least to some extent as &#145;moral police&#146;, concentrating on young women and prostitutes loitering near railway stations used by servicemen. This type of work became officially sanctioned, but Boyle split away from the organization over the use of the WVP to enforce a curfew on women of &#145;loose character&#146; near a service base in Grantham. Boyle saw this as a &#145;slur upon <i>all</i> women&#146;  (Carrier, 17). Dawson, the organizational strength in the WVP, carried on and developed the corps into the women police service, ultimately leading to official acceptance of women as police officers. In late 1916 Boyle went to Macedonia and Serbia to do war relief work, for which she was awarded the Samaritan order of Serbia and the allied medal.<br>
<br>Although women over thirty gained the vote in 1918, there was some doubt as to whether women were eligible to stand for parliament. In March 1918 Boyle attempted to stand as a WFL candidate in the Keighley by-election. Although her nomination was rejected because of a technical flaw, the returning officer's willingness to accept her candidature established the desired principle.<br>
<br>During the 1920s and 1930s Boyle remained active in a broad range of women's organizations. She campaigned on behalf of the National Union of Women Teachers, the Women's Election Committee, the Open Door Council (which aimed to remove protective barriers that restricted women's employment opportunities), and also organizations concerned with the welfare of women and children in developing countries. She was particularly active in the Save the Children Fund (SCF). In 1921 she went to the USSR to work in an SCF famine relief programme, she wrote articles for SCF publications, and she made frequent speeches as an SCF representative. On 20 May 1936 the SCF honoured her with a tribute at the Lyceum Club.<br>
<br>In 1920 Boyle had a novel, <span class="italic">Out of the Frying-Pan</span>, published. Although it was not received particularly well by reviewers, she went on to write a string of adventure romance novels ending with <span class="italic">Good Old Potts</span> in 1934. In many of her books &#145;remarkably capable&#146; women were apparent  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 12 March 1925, 173), and the reviewer of her 1927 work, <span class="italic">The Rights of Mallaroche</span>, thought readers should enjoy the book &#145;then go back to p.289 to smile at the feminism which Miss Boyle has kept hot from her suffragette days&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 27 Oct 1927, 769).<br>
<br>Boyle was a committed and principled activist whose actions led in part to increased opportunities for women to be involved in both the making and the enforcement of the law. Her courage and determination for her causes were remembered as being complemented by a developed sense of humour and modesty. She never married. She died in a nursing home at 99 Cromwell Road, London, on 4 March 1943, and was cremated at Golders Green on 9 March.<br>
