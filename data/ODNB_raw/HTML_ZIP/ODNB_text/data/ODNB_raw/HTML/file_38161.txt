<span class="headword">Yeoman,  Thomas</span>  (1709/10&#150;1781), <span class="occ">millwright and surveyor</span>, was probably born in Somerset. Although his origins and early life are obscure, his career embraced many different aspects during a formative phase of the early industrial revolution, and he became one of the most prolific and influential civil engineers of the period and a founding father of the profession. He is first encountered as the wheelwright skilled in &#145;turning iron &amp; Brass, &amp; making machinery for grinding&#146;  (Birmingham Reference Library, Johnson MS 185602), who was recruited by Edward Cave to operate the first water-powered cotton-spinning mill at Northampton in 1741, using the system patented by Lewis Paul. At the time of his recruitment, Yeoman was probably employed at Abbey Mills in Bromley, one of several mills located on the complex of streams on the tidal reaches of the River Lea.<br>
<br>Moving to Northampton about 1742, Yeoman soon began to take an active role in the commercial, cultural, and religious life of the town. While working as &#145;Operator for Mr Cave's Cotton Engines&#146;  (<span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>, 5 Dec 1743), he first established himself as a millwright in St Mary's Street. From there he advertised his services, including the construction of a range of machinery such as John Wyatt's weighbridge and the ventilator invented by Stephen Hales, which provided a regular source of employment throughout the 1740s and 1750s. Yeoman corresponded frequently with Hales on this and related subjects and fitted ventilators into numerous buildings throughout the country, including the town gaol in Northampton and the infirmary, newly founded in 1743. He became president of the Northampton Philosophical Society, one of the earliest and most important provincial societies, which met in his house and numbered among its members Philip Doddridge and William Shipley, who later founded the Society of Arts. Yeoman built and sold scientific instruments from his new premises in Gold Street, and in 1746&#150;7 he undertook a series of scientific lecture demonstrations in Northampton, Coventry, and Birmingham, with exhibits of electrical apparatus. He continued to operate an &#145;Experiment room&#146; in his house and in 1748 he advertised proposals for <span class="italic">Uranographia Britannica</span>, a celestial atlas by the astronomer John Bevis, an ambitious and ultimately unsuccessful venture.<br>
<br>Yeoman was evidently already married when he moved to Northampton; the birth of a son, Samuel, was recorded in October 1742, but his wife, Sarah, died in 1746. On 18 August 1747 he married Anne (1707/8&#150;1793), the sister of Joshua Remington, a wealthy grocer of the town. Two further children were born: a son, Thomas, in August 1748 and a daughter, Anne, in January 1752. In 1752 another son, James, was apprenticed to John Neale, a maker of scientific instruments in London and an occasional partner of Yeoman.<br>
<br>For all of his adult life, Yeoman was a Baptist and, during his time in Northampton, a prominent member of the College Lane Baptist Church. The Baptist minister, John Gill, an influential high-Calvinistic theologian, wrote to Yeoman in 1745 to promote his forthcoming <span class="italic">Exposition of the New Testament</span>. Yeoman subscribed not only to this but to all Gill's major works between 1746 and 1769. On a number of occasions he acted on behalf of the church, and he discharged his social obligations by supporting the infirmary; several times he acted as a house visitor and from 1746 to 1752 he was a member of the committee of governors. It was probably in this social context that Yeoman came to the attention of the local whig grandee Lord Halifax who, as president of the Board of Trade and later first lord of the Admiralty, was able to secure him preferment with the Admiralty.<br>
<br>Yeoman's interests diversified considerably while he was in Northampton and his career blossomed. Commensurate with this, his social status rose as he moved first to Gold Street and finally, in 1755, to Bridge Street. He continued to construct ventilators, for both land and sea use, and in 1751 he was commissioned to install machines in four merchantmen at Rotterdam. Work on marine ventilation was to lead to further employment by the Admiralty, first in 1756, in the naval hospitals, and later installing ventilators into vessels of the fleet itself. Yeoman's work as an engineer was reported and advertised not only locally but also nationally, through the pages of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, published by Edward Cave. During this period Yeoman also turned to surveying, both for local estate owners and for turnpike trusts. He first surveyed the River Nene in 1744 and his work in this field developed to become the major occupation of his later career. In 1756 he gave evidence to the parliamentary commission for the navigation of the River Nene, and in 1758, as the work was in progress, he was several times engaged by the commissioners to act as both surveyor and consultant engineer.<br>
<br>When the cotton mill declined and finally closed about 1756, Yeoman moved to London, where he established himself first in Little Peter Street, Westminster, and continued his work as a surveyor and engineer. In Thomas Mortimer's <span class="italic">Universal Director</span> (1763) Yeoman was credited with the ventilation of the Drury Lane Theatre and the houses of parliament, and for the first time he was described as a civil engineer. In 1760 he was elected to the Society of Arts, and he continued to play an active part in its proceedings until the late 1770s. He proposed numerous new members between 1760 and 1776, including a number of other surveyors and engineers. From 1763 he was chairman of the committee of mechanics and in 1768 he presented the society with a model of the Hales ventilator. In 1764 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, but he seems to have participated little in its activities.<br>
<br>During the 1760s and 1770s Yeoman's main occupation was as a surveyor and engineer of canal and river navigations and of drainage schemes. Besides the River Nene, he worked on the rivers Ivel, Stort, Chelmer, Lea, Stour, Stroud, Medway, and Thames; on the Aire and Calder Canal, and the Clyde Canal; on the draining of the level of Ancholme and of Deeping Fen; and he appeared a number of times to give evidence before parliamentary committees. He published several engineering reports, though no books; a manual for the instruction of millwrights that he was preparing in the 1740s was never completed. Probably his greatest surviving achievement is the Limehouse cut, linking the River Lea to the Thames upstream of the Isle of Dogs, which he completed, as John Smeaton's assistant, in 1770.<br>
<br>By about 1769 Yeoman had moved to Castle Street in Leicester Fields, Westminster, and he continued a Baptist as a member of the Grafton Street church, where he served as both deacon and secretary to the church. In 1766&#150;7 he played a prominent part in an acrimonious dispute which ended with the congregation dismissing its minister, William Anderson, and replacing him with Benjamin Messer.<br>
<br>From 1770, then in his sixties, Yeoman was increasingly employed as a consulting engineer, and in recognition of his standing in the embryonic profession he was elected in 1771 the first president of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93805', "Society of Civil Engineers")</script>. His final illness was recorded in the society's minutes in April 1780; his will had been written in the previous year. In it he made provision for his widow and four surviving daughters, and listed properties in London and Trudoxhill, Somerset. Yeoman died at his home in Castle Street on 23 January 1781, and was buried on 31 January in Bunhill Fields. His wife Anne survived him until 6 November 1793, and was then buried in the same grave; the grave no longer exists, but the inscription has been preserved.<br>
