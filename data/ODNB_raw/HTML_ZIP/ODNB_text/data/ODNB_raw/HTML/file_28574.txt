<span class="headword">Wallis,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1866), <span class="occ">topographer and cartographer</span>, born in Fore Street, Bodmin, on 11 April 1789, was the eldest child of John Wallis (1759&#150;1842), attorney and town clerk of Bodmin, and his wife, Isabella Mary, daughter of Henry Slogget, purser in the Royal Navy. He had a twin brother, Henry, and a younger sister, Isabella Mary. He was educated at Tiverton grammar school, and afterwards articled to his father. After being admitted a solicitor and proctor about 1811 he practised as an attorney in Bodmin with his father and John Bennett until 1814. He matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 17 December 1813, graduating BA on 7 July 1820, and MA on 20 March 1821. On completing his residence at Oxford he was ordained in 1817, curate at Blisland, and was then appointed vicar of Bodmin on 17 November of the same year. He was a capital burgess of the borough, and served as mayor in 1822. In 1840 he became deputy registrar of the archdeaconry of Cornwall, a post which he retained until his death. He was also vice-warden of the stannaries of Cornwall.<br>
<br>Wallis was a keen topographer and cartographer of Bodmin and the surrounding districts. His first publication was a reprint of the index to Thomas Martyn's &#145;Map of the county of Cornwall&#146;, to which he appended a short account of the archdeaconry of Cornwall (1816). In 1825 he published thirteen outline maps of the archdeaconry and county of Cornwall, at the scale of 4 miles to the inch. Between 1831 and 1834 he published several reports and tables about Bodmin, and between 1827 and 1838 he published in twenty parts <span class="italic">The Bodmin Register</span>, which contained much historical and geographical information about Bodmin and Cornwall in general. Of his projected <span class="italic">Exeter Register</span> only the first part was published (1831). His <span class="italic">Cornwall Register</span> (1847&#150;8), in twelve parts, contained particulars of Cornish parishes, and was accompanied by a map of Cornwall at the scale of 4 miles to the inch. He also wrote a <span class="italic">Family Register</span> (1827) and several pamphlets, chiefly on topographical subjects.<br>
<br>Wallis died at Bodmin vicarage, unmarried, on 6 December 1866, and was buried at Berry cemetery, Bodmin, on the 11th. He was described as amiable and energetic, able to stay on friendly terms with the many nonconformists in his parish.<br>
