<span class="headword">Aston,  Walter</span>, Baron Aston of Forfar  (1584&#150;1639), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born about June 1584 at Charlecote, Warwickshire, and baptized there on 9 July, the son and heir of Sir Edward Aston of Tixall, Staffordshire, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17151/', "Sir Thomas Lucy (b. in or before 1532, d. 1600)")</script> of Charlecote. He spent his early life at Tixall. After the death of his father on 1 February 1597, Lord Burghley, master of the court of wards, granted his wardship to the attorney-general, Edward Coke, who paid fees of &pound;300 to the crown and &pound;1000 to Burghley in secret. The properties of Aston, assessed at &pound;256 p.a., were popularly overvalued at &pound;10,000. In 1600 Aston married Anne Barnes, without the permission of Coke, who insisted that this match be dissolved by the court of high commission. At this time Aston became a patron of the poet Michael Drayton, who, from 1602 to 1607, dedicated five of his works to him and, at the ceremony on 25 July 1603 where Aston was created a knight of the Bath, acted as his esquire. In 1607 Coke agreed to Aston's marriage to Gertrude, only daughter of Sir Thomas Sadler of Standon, Hertfordshire, and received a final fee of &pound;4000. In 1611 Aston paid &pound;1095 for a baronetcy and in 1618 James appointed him steward of the honour of Tutbury.<br>
<br>On 11 November 1619 Aston was nominated resident ambassador to Spain, with instructions dated 5 January 1620 that required him to sound out both Philip III's terms for the marriage of the infanta to Prince Charles and the prospects for James's son-in-law as king of Bohemia, but &#145;to deny that we encouraged it&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 94/23, fols. 279&#150;90). He was also to discuss the ships and equipment for an Anglo-Spanish fleet to patrol against piracy, but this future naval collaboration was shelved in 1623 by the breakdown of the Spanish match. Skilled in speaking and writing Castilian, Aston's reports from Madrid were well-informed. Buckingham assured him in October 1623 that &#145;his Majestie was never better satisfyed with a dispatch [than] the last you sent&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 94/28, fol. 229). None the less, there were serious disappointments. On 5 June 1624 Aston wrote to Prince Charles:<blockquote>in the 4 yeares that I have served here, by reason of ill payment and such charges, which &hellip; I could not avoyd, that which is now owing me &hellip; I believe is a greater sum than was ever due unto any ambassador. (BL, Add. MS 36447, fol. 89)</blockquote>To pay off debts he sold portions of his patrimony in England, which weakened severely his heir's holdings. Meanwhile he was disappointed by his failure to move Philip to persuade the emperor and the duke of Bavaria that the Palatinate crisis must be resolved to the satisfaction of the English court. Aston was warned by Charles in 1624 that he considered it &#145;a condition of the good friendship &hellip; he deserved&#146;, if he were to marry the infanta  (Gardiner, 272).<br>
<br>Charles's liking for &#145;dear Wat&#146; continued into his reign as king, since he pardoned Aston after his return for all prosecutions for recusancy to which his conversion to Catholicism in 1623 laid him open. At a meeting at Theobalds on 20 July 1626 the king promised Aston help in two years for his debt of &pound;14,000: this was vital, according to Aston, for he had spent &#145;four parts of five of his estate in that service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1625&#150;49</i>, 227). Later Charles decided to honour him with a barony in Scotland, which he accepted, but he complained to Secretary Conway that it would have been &#145;a great comfort&#146; to him had &#145;the ancient house of Tixall&#146; been honoured  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1627&#150;8</i>, 270, 348). As a basis for his title of &#145;Baron Forfar in county Angus&#146; Charles gave him a bond of &pound;1000 to buy land in Scotland, the office of keeper of the king's mulberry garden at St James's with a fee of &pound;60 p.a., and annual pensions of &pound;100 p.a. and &pound;50 p.a. for himself and his wife respectively. Finally, in December 1628 a warrant was issued to prepare a bill for a privy seal to pay out of the exchequer &pound;14,000 to cancel his debt. Early in 1631 he was made a commissioner in his county to enforce a fine upon gentry who failed to appear at Charles's coronation to receive knighthood. In June 1635 he prepared his last will, &#145;being careful to sett in order my estate&#146;, prior to returning as envoy to Spain. While his son, Walter (<i>b</i>. 1609), was an executor and heir, his five other children held annuities and his wife the use of his silver plate and furniture for life. After his arrival in Madrid Arthur Hopton remained for months to assist him. While the Palatinate dispute remained intractable, his papers for 1636&#150;8 show his assistance to twenty-seven law suits of English merchants in Spanish courts and give detailed accounts of the political burdens facing Olivares. Two problems relating to Charles I were highlighted: the role of English ships in the transport of silver to pay the army of Flanders and the strained relations of the ambassador, the count of O&ntilde;ate, with several courtiers. His duties took their toll on his health, and in the spring of 1638 he was recalled to England. He died on 13 August 1639 and was buried in St Mary's Church, Stafford. His wife survived him.<br>
