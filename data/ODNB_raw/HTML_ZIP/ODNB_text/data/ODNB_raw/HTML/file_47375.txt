<span class="headword">Maddison,  Fred</span>  (1856&#150;1937), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 17 August 1856 at Boston, Lincolnshire, the son of Richard Maddinson, a hotel worker, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Yates. When precisely the spelling of his surname changed is unknown. After a period of education at the Adelaide Street Wesleyan school in Hull, he served an apprenticeship as a compositor, and developed into a quintessential late Victorian radical craftsman. In 1879 he married Jane Ann Weatherill of Bewholme in Yorkshire; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>When the Trades Union Congress met in Hull in 1886 Maddison acted as its president, a consequence of his position as president of the Hull Trades Council. He was a committed Liberal, a supporter of the eight-hour day and the payment of MPs. From 1887 he was president of the Hull branch of the Labour Electoral Association, with an agenda of securing the election to parliament and local authorities of working men under Liberal Party auspices.<br>
<br>Maddison's most significant trade union activity began in 1889 when he became editor of the <span class="italic">Railway Review</span>, the organ of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants. He was an effective editor, and had a close association with the railway servants' general secretary, Edward Harford (1837&#150;1898). Both were Liberals and became increasingly the target of criticism from those union activists who espoused independent labour or socialist politics. In 1897 Harford was dismissed; his successor, Richard Bell (1859&#150;1930), although essentially a Liberal, was supportive of the union policy of a more assertive &#145;all grades&#146; campaign for improved conditions. Maddison felt that a limited union membership made successful industrial action unlikely and argued thus in an editorial. Following criticism from Bell and the union's executive Maddison resigned, admitting his purpose had been &#145;to avert a general strike&#146;  (<span class="italic">Railway Review</span>, 10 Dec 1897). This rift was a consequence of differences over union strategy, a desire by a full-time official and a union executive to control the behaviour of an employee, and a significant political difference between Maddison and several members of the society's executive.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Maddison emerged as a vigorous anti-socialist and a defender of labour movement links with the Liberal Party. In 1892 and in 1895 he stood unsuccessfully as &#145;Lib&#150;Lab&#146; candidate for Central Hull. A violent dock strike in 1893 found Maddison attempting to conciliate between Liberal shipowners and trade unionists. One Independent Labour Party member characterized him as &#145;a paltry mean miserable party hack&#146;  (J. Northern to James Keir Hardie, quoted in Howell, 119).<br>
<br>Eventually in August 1897 Maddison was returned to the Commons in a by-election for the working-class constituency of Sheffield Brightside. His Commons career was brief. He opposed the South African War as a campaign waged for the benefit of international financiers. His radical sentiments (flavoured with antisemitism) failed to gain endorsement from the Brightside electorate, many of whom were involved in armaments manufacture. Sheffield Liberalism was divided over the war and in the 1900 election Maddison was defeated.<br>
<br>Maddison's response to the formation of the Labour Representation Committee in February 1900 was hostile and dismissive&#151;&#145;the shortest and surest path to Labour representation is by way of Liberalism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Speaker</span>, 593). In 1906 Maddison successfully contested Burnley in a three-cornered contest, but was run close not just by the Conservatives but by H. M. Hyndman of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). In a town with a significant SDF presence, the contest saw a sharp juxtaposition of Lib&#150;Lab and socialist rhetoric. His second period as an MP saw Maddison clearly at odds not just with Labour sentiment as articulated by the Parliamentary Labour Party, but also with Liberals prepared to consider some state intervention. In the Commons Maddison, unlike many Liberals, vehemently opposed the Labour Party's &#145;right to work&#146; bill as &#145;the first fruit of the Socialist agitation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 4</span>, 186, 1908, col. 32).<br>
<br>The January 1910 election saw Maddison's defeat at Burnley by ninety-five votes; in December 1910 he unsuccessfully contested Darlington. After the war he stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal at Holderness (1918), South Dorset (1922), and Reading (1923). He continued with two enthusiasms characteristic of his radicalism&#151;industrial co-partnership and international arbitration. From 1897 he had been an organizer for what became the Labour Co-partnership Association and from 1908 was secretary of the International Arbitration League. Much of his later life was spent at Ealing and then at Hounslow. He died at the Grove Nursing Home, 18 The Grove, Heston, Isleworth, on 12 March 1937. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Maddison was a Victorian radical, strongly influenced by Giuseppe Mazzini. He responded vigorously to the socialist challenge in the 1890s; his ideas changed little and by the 1906 parliament he seemed somewhat outdated. His most productive years were perhaps as editor of the <span class="italic">Railway Review</span> and his resignation from it arguably marked a critical deterioration in his relationship with the labour movement.<br>
