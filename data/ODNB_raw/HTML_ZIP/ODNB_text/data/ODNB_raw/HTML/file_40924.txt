<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Butler,  Eliza Marian <span class="st"> [Elsie]</span></span>  (1885&#150;1959), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 29 December 1885 in Bardsea, Lancashire, third daughter and third of the seven children of Theobald Fitzwalter Butler (1845&#150;1914), a coal owner and iron manufacturer at Barrow in Furness, and his wife, Catherine Elizabeth Barraclough (<i>d</i>. 1946). Her father wanted his children educated abroad, and Eliza (Elsie) was dispatched to Hanover. This led to a lifelong preoccupation with German literature and a lifelong scepticism about the Germans. She became a German scholar in spite of herself.<br>
<br>After Hanover, a spell in Paris, and a year at Cheltenham, Butler entered Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1908 and obtained first-class honours in the medieval and modern languages tripos in 1910. Some schoolteaching was followed by research on Friedrich Hebbel in Bonn, where she was put off by what she saw as Germanic academic pettiness and was dismayed by nationalist attitudes. The outbreak of the First World War sent her home, and she taught French, then German at Newnham (with more detested schoolteaching in between), and was once almost arrested as a spy. In 1917&#150;18 she served in the Scottish women's hospitals unit in Russia and Macedonia. Then, after she had taught for two years at Avery Hill Training College, Newnham offered her a lectureship in German. She would have preferred French or Russian.<br>
<br>Still seeking a research topic, Butler turned to Professor J. G. Robertson (1867&#150;1933) in London. He suggested Heine (who also disliked the Germans), and the result was <span class="italic">The Saint-Simonian Religion in Germany</span> (1926), a large book which she claimed nobody ever read. Her second book was again out of the mainstream, a biography of the eccentric aristocrat Hermann von P&uuml;ckler-Muskau, <span class="italic">The Tempestuous Prince</span> (1929), whose ghost she claimed to have met, briefly, in Berlin. Still eager to escape from German, her next involvement, juxtaposing literary and psychological analysis, was with another flamboyant writer in <span class="italic">Sheridan: a Ghost Story</span> (1931).<br>
<br>After a sabbatical year visiting India with the Pali scholar Isaline Blew Horner (1896&#150;1981), her companion from 1926 onwards, there appeared Butler's finest work, <span class="italic">The Tyranny of Greece over Germany</span> (1935). The book is broad in its literary coverage; it is scholarly but highly readable; and it is a polemic. Whatever their own views on the matter, Butler argued, the Germans had not been liberated by Greek ideals, but had become obsessed with a distortion of those ideals while assimilating them less than any other nation. How, she asked, could German Hellenism have produced only pain and dionysiac frenzy, and she raised doubts about accepted views of Goethe and German classicism. The book was, predictably, not translated into German. A visit to Germany in 1936, too, was soured by antisemitism and swastikas.<br>
<br>In 1936 Butler took the Henry Simon chair of German at Manchester University. Though increasingly depressed by the contrast between Germany's literature and its political present, she wrote a biography of another literary individualist, <span class="italic">Rainer Maria Rilke</span> (1941), aiming again not just to present the poetry, but to dispel some of the Rilke myths. She was appointed in 1944 to the Schroeder chair of German in Cambridge, where her elder sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62108/', "Kathleen Teresa Butler")</script> was mistress of Girton College. Her inaugural lecture, &#145;The direct method in German poetry&#146; (25 January 1946) again tried to match German literature with a national psyche that produced Nazism. This led to three books on the ambivalent figure of the magus, which had always fascinated her: <span class="italic">The Myth of the Magus</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Ritual Magic</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Faust</span> (1952). These interests prompted her to visit Aleister Crowley (1875&#150;1947), the once-notorious diabolist, and her autobiography makes clear her strong sense of the supernatural. Her not infrequent encounters with ghosts are recounted in her autobiography in a deliberately doubting tone that has the effect of making them entirely believable.<br>
<br>Butler was president of the Conference of University Teachers of German in 1948&#150;9, and retired in 1951, living until her death in London, where she wrote two short novels, <span class="italic">Daylight in a Dream</span> (1951) and <span class="italic">Silver Wings</span> (1952), summed up in <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituary as &#145;not very good&#146;  (14 Nov 1959), a judgement that she had herself ruefully accepted. <span class="italic">Heinrich Heine: a Biography</span> and <span class="italic">Byron and Goethe: Analysis of a Passion</span>, both in 1956, were followed by a sparkling autobiography, <span class="italic">Paper Boats</span> (1959); an incomplete study, <span class="italic">Napoleon and the Poets</span>, remains in manuscript in the Institute of Germanic Studies, London. Elsie Butler was sceptical but always scholarly, a feature overlooked by those who dismissed her work as frivolous. Her position as an outside observer allowed her to address problems that nationalist literary approaches did not even recognize. While able to respond to the essence of cultures (India, Greece, Russia), she was clearly attracted to a particular type of forceful literary individual, and with Heine, Byron, P&uuml;ckler-Muskau, Rilke, and the others, she recognized beside their &#145;star quality&#146; the conflicts between the inner self, the writings, and the image. London and Oxford gave her honorary doctorates in 1957 and 1959. She died at her home, 30 Dawson Place, Bayswater, London, on 13 November 1959, and a memorial service was held on 7 December in King's College chapel, Cambridge.<br>
