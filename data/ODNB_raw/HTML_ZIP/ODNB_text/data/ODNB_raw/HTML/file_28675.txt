<span class="headword">Warburton,  Peter</span>  (1588&#150;1666), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 27 March 1588, the eldest son of Peter Warburton of Hefferston Grange, Cheshire, and Magdalen, daughter of Robert Moulton of St Alban, Wood Street, London, auditor of the exchequer during the reign of Elizabeth I. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 11 May 1604 and graduated BA on 22 November 1606. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 27 January 1607, possibly after a period at Staple Inn, and was called to the bar in 1612. At an unknown date he married Alice, daughter of John Gardener of Worcester. This may not have been his only marriage: his will of 1664 implies that not all his children were the offspring of his then wife.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1641, Warburton was part of a commission in Cheshire for the levying of the first of the Long Parliament's two subsidies. In June 1649 the Rump created him serjeant and raised him to the bench of the common pleas as part of a larger move to replace the seven of the fifteen common-law judges who had declined to continue under the Commonwealth. He was a member of the commission that tried the Leveller leader John Lilburne at the London Guildhall in October 1649. Over the course of the interregnum Warburton served on all circuits. He was &#145;a strong adherent of the Rump&#146; and Oliver Cromwell did not renew his appointment upon his accession as lord protector at the end of 1653  (Black, &#145;Coram protectore&#146;, 59). He seems to have played little role in public life over the next two years although it appears that he served on the militia commission for Cheshire on 14 March 1655 along with Sir George Booth and Sir William Brereton. Warburton re-emerged from obscurity with Cromwell's raising of him to the upper bench in February 1656, and on 9 February the next year he presided with Lord Chief Justice Glynne at the trial of Miles Sindercombe. On succeeding as protector, Richard Cromwell re-appointed Warburton on 29 September 1658 but in May 1660 the Convention Parliament declined to continue his appointment. Although Warburton was pardoned at the Restoration, Charles II did not confirm him as serjeant. By the time Warburton came to draw up his will in February 1664 he was living in Wood Street, London. He bequeathed land in Staffordshire, Middlesex, and London to his son Peter, and other legacies to his son Robert, daughters Esther, Lady Goodricke, Elizabeth, Anne, and Abigail, and to his wife and her daughters, Sara and Anne. He died on either 26 or (more probably) 28 February 1666, and was buried at Fetcham church, Surrey.<br>
