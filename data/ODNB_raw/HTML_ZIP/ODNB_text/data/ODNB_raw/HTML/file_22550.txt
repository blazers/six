</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Porson,  Richard</span>  (1759&#150;1808), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 25 December 1759 in East Ruston, a remote village in Norfolk, about 4 miles from the coast, the third of seven children, four of whom survived to adulthood, of Huggin Porson (<i>d</i>. 1806) and Ann Palmer (<i>d</i>. 1784).<h2>
<a name="Familyandearlyeducation"></a>Family and early education</h2>Porson's childhood was unusually academic and, somewhat like the young Montaigne being taught Latin at home before he spoke French, his youth was invested with high hopes and imaginative energy on the part of his parents. His father was a worsted weaver by trade who became the local parish clerk, succeeding his own father in the position. Porson's mother was the highly intelligent daughter of a shoemaker in a nearby village. She learned to read and then, while in service at the house of a gentleman with a well stocked library, pursued a passion for Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and other English standard authors, which she passed on to her children.<br>
<br>From the earliest possible age Porson and his siblings, boys and girls alike, were given strenuous memory and mathematical lessons and exercises by their father and it is known that Richard had the opportunity to study haphazardly but deeply in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, John Jewel's <span class="italic">Apology</span>, Greenwood's <span class="italic">English Grammar</span>, an odd volume of Chambers's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia</span> (picked up from a wrecked and stranded cargo vessel on the Norfolk coast), and several volumes of the <span class="italic">Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure</span>.<br>
<br>At about nine Porson was sent to the free school in the neighbouring coastal village of Happisburgh, when he was taught by a remarkable schoolmaster, himself only about twenty, a Mr Summers, who found not only that the boy could extract cube roots in his head but that he was &#145;shrewd, sensible and intelligent&#146;. Under Summers's guidance, Porson soon learned formal mathematics, the fundamentals of Latin, and, importantly, an extraordinary skill and neatness in penmanship. Even at this early age Porson seems to have enjoyed and to have learned from meticulous copying; examples of professional calligraphic quality survive on subjects such as great circle sailing and astronomical problems under the Copernican system.<br>
<br>In due course Porson's achievements caught the attention of Thomas Hewitt, the local vicar, and of John Norris (1734&#150;1777), a man of wealth and benevolence in nearby Witton, and founder of the Norrisian professorship of divinity at Cambridge. Hewitt was educating his own sons at home, in Bacton (a coastal village some 3 miles from East Ruston), and offered the eleven-year-old Porson the opportunity to join them each Monday to Saturday, which he did. This arrangement continued for about two years, whereupon the boy was tested for ability by James Lambert, who had recently been elected regius professor of Greek at Trinity College, Cambridge. Thus, by a remarkable series of connections and chances, while barely a teenager, Porson (&#145;the Norfolk boy&#146;, as some at Cambridge described him), was on course not only towards his eventual area of expertise but was in direct high-level contact with an important representative of the very college and professorial chair in which he would attain his own fame, both in Britain and abroad.<h2>
<a name="EtonCollege"></a>Eton College</h2>By about March 1773 it was recognized even by his Norfolk patrons that the young Porson had remarkable abilities but that he was &#145;an unwinning cub&#146; who needed allowances made for the awkwardness of his manners. Bearing a letter of introduction from Hewitt, the young Porson arrived in Cambridge and was tested, favourably, by senior tutors, including Thomas Postlethwaite, later master of that college. After a further year of home study with Hewitt, Porson entered Eton in August 1774, largely on the basis of a considerable fund collected by Norris, and administered by Sir George Baker, president of the College of Physicians and physician to the king and the queen. Thus, before the age of fifteen, such was the promise held out for Porson that his name was already known within some of the top academic circles in the country.<br>
<br>The three and a half years Porson spent at Eton, however, must have done little to satisfy the more ambitious expectations of Summers, Hewitt, Norris, and Baker and one can only speculate what goals the boy awaited from himself. He was occasionally in poor health (from asthma) and was never physically robust, although he grew to 6 feet and was to all appearances a healthy man. Writing about this period of Porson's life, one of his earliest biographers, Thomas Kidd, claimed (without personal knowledge) that at Eton, Porson was inclined to drink, at night, and usually alone. Kidd asserted that he developed habits and attitudes which would be seen as characterizing the rest of his life: ability coupled with indifference, punctuated by periods of feverish, sometimes brilliant, effort and long periods of reading without systematic production of work of his own.<br>
<br>On the purely academic side it was clear at Eton that Porson's scholarly attainments had been overrated. He was not inclined to take his lessons seriously and he knew little Greek and little of prosody, compared to classmates such as Richard Wellesley, Marquess Wellesley, who was rated &#145;infinitely superior to [Porson] in composition&#146;. Porson took some solace at Eton both acting in and in writing plays, including one called <span class="italic">Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire</span>&#151;the title is both suggestive and revealing. Many years later he repeated the play from memory to a friend at Trinity College. The <span class="italic">Frying-Pan</span> play ends with a soliloquy in which the Dr Faustus part (Porson's reincarnation of the friar in the Friar Bacon legend who proposed a brass wall around Britain to fend off her enemies) reasons that the island can defend itself by valour alone. This is essential Porson: truth and courage and defiance concealed behind apparent light-hearted but ironical humour and metaphorical word play.<h2>
<a name="Intellectualcharacter"></a>Intellectual character</h2>Any expression of Porson's own lifelong dialogue, deep within himself, he reserved to silent penmanship and to one massive treatise on the Christian Trinity, a detailed and obscure work. Occasionally he gave more sarcastic vent to his feelings, but did so in ways that were clever and passed for mere wit, sober or otherwise&#151;and he generally chose the objects of his satire with great care. Even under Summers he had shown signs of &#145;a little spirit of satire&#146; and while at Eton he wrote a lampoon on his schoolfellow Charles Simeon, later the evangelical leader, who in his youth had affected some of the airs of a dandy, whereas all his life Porson was careless, even negligent, about his appearance. Aware that his humble background severely limited his future prospects, Porson sought to make his mark, either by displaying his brilliant insights into classical learning, or by dazzling those around him with his feats of prodigious memory.<br>
<br>Porson's memory was considered amazing even in an era where much more emphasis was placed on rote learning than today. There are literally hundreds of surviving Porson anecdotes attesting to his skill, most of them strongly suggesting that he thoroughly enjoyed displaying himself in this way. Some such stories have him behaving almost like a circus oddity, reciting lengthy passages of Greek from memory, or reciting them both from memory and backwards. Others have Porson allegedly identifying which edition of Thucydides a reader was testing him from by being able to remember which side of the page a particular word occurred in a particular edition and then being able to regurgitate the entire relevant passage on the page of the edition in question, sight unseen. Many of his memory feats were no doubt authentic, but many sound embellished for effect, if not by Porson himself, then by his many admirers. Porson's feats of memory did not come without intense effort and he admitted that to retain information he sometimes had to copy it several times and read it a dozen.<br>
<br>The memory skill was developed early on and, coming late to Latin and Greek as compared to other boys with whom he studied, Porson must have found that his mathematical skills would serve well for words. Indeed, he later found that memory could form the search engine for some of his most famous classical text emendations. Rather than having the unwanted memory powers of some kind of <i>idiot savant</i>, Porson's memory seems to have been developed by him as a necessary adjunct to his scholarship and no doubt went along with his lifelong habit of writing out his notes in calligraphic fair copy.<h2>
<a name="Cambridge"></a>Cambridge</h2>In March 1778 Porson entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner. In 1781 he won the Craven scholarship with Greek iambics of a technical quality that revealed he had more than made up whatever had been gaps in his knowledge before his arrival in Cambridge. They were much admired at the time, although by modern standards they are defective, inasmuch as they violate Porson's own celebrated metrical law by allowing three out of seventeen lines to have a caesura in the fifth foot preceded by a long syllable. In the following year he won the chancellor's medal and in 1785 was elected to a fellowship, despite a rule making junior bachelors ineligible.<br>
<br>Porson thereafter devoted his time to Greek, with virtually nothing by way of teaching duties, until a great turning point came in his academic life. The statutes of Trinity required that fellows must be in holy orders after seven years had elapsed from the taking of their MA degree. Porson's time was up in 1792, and it was clear that he would not choose to be ordained. At the time there were two fellowships open to laymen and Porson believed that the master of Trinity, Postlethwaite, had promised him one of them, but instead the master awarded it to his own nephew, a person of no particular academic merit or distinction. The incident created something of a scandal at the time and it deeply affected Porson&#151;he spoke to a friend about how hard it was to &#145;renovate&#146; a man's spirit when it had been broken. He moved to London and for the rest of his life, only rarely returned to Cambridge.<br>
<br>At just this time the regius professorship of Greek, for which Porson had long been hoping, became vacant and, not requiring ordination or subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, Porson was encouraged by Postlethwaite to make himself available as a candidate. He was unanimously elected in 1792. Porson took Euripides as the subject of his prelection, the public address in Latin required in connection with taking up the professorship. Friends, including Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode and Charles Burney, raised a large fund for Porson's support, of which he declined all but the annual interest, which amounted to about &pound;100.<br>
<br>The remaining years of Porson's life were spent in London. He never left England and was clearly piqued when the Cambridge Syndics denied him the means with which to travel to Florence in order to collate the famous Medicean (&#145;Laurentian&#146;) manuscript of Aeschylus, claiming, with deliberate malapropism, that Porson &#145;could collect [<i>sic</i>] his manuscripts at home&#146;. Porson correctly saw that as the slap it was intended to be. The valuable estate and library which he assembled suggests that Porson could have found the means to travel but this open rejection of his request must have eroded or even have killed off his desire. Without the approval he deserved, he retreated into a life of supposedly excessive drinking but at the same time produced most of his best scholarly work.<br>
<br>In London on 24 November 1796 Porson married Mary Lunan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Perry (<i>d</i>. 1797), the divorced sister of his very close friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21996/', "James Perry (1756&#150;1821)")</script>, editor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. The marriage seems to have been happy, and the well-known portrait of Porson by John Hoppner dates from this time. Mary's death on 12 April 1797, barely six months into the marriage, was a severe blow to Porson, who later always spoke about her to friends with great emotion and sincere affection, sometimes with tears in his eyes.<h2>
<a name="Theologicalcontroversy"></a>Theological controversy</h2>Porson's reputation as a formidable critic was confirmed beyond doubt by the <span class="italic">Letters to Mr Archdeacon Travis, in Answer to his Defence of the Three Heavenly Witnesses</span> (1790), which were first published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as a series of seven letters in 1788&#150;9. The matter at issue was a disputed verse in the first epistle of <span class="roman">John</span> (5: 7), about the three heavenly witnesses, which had been condemned as spurious by Edward Gibbon in his <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span>. The interpolated words in this verse had been rejected by serious scholars, including Richard Bentley, who had made it the subject of his prelection as divinity professor in Cambridge in 1717. In 1782 a hapless archdeacon in Chester, George Travis, ventured to defend the genuineness of the added words in the verse and to attack Gibbon at the same time, by publishing a series of &#145;Letters to Edward Gibbon&#146; in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, which were reprinted, with additional errors, in 1784. Despite the flimsiness of its learning and the error of its conclusion, Travis's defence stood unchallenged until Porson decided to enter the fray. His &#145;Letters to Archdeacon Travis&#146;, which were later turned into a weighty book containing much additional research, mercilessly exposed the errors of Travis. Gibbon was delighted and hailed Porson's <span class="italic">Letters</span> as &#145;the most acute and accurate piece of criticism since the days of Bentley&#146;. Some readers were offended not only by Porson's conclusion but by the fact that he had used wit and even flippancy to reach it. There is evidence that an old lady from Norfolk was so infuriated with Porson for having written &#145;against Christianity&#146; that she changed her will to exclude him from what would have been a large cash legacy. Porson did not care.<br>
<br>Commentators have generally concluded that Porson wrote to confute Travis because of Porson's strong love of truth, which he surely had (Porson had written that &#145;he does the best service to truth, who hinders it from being supported by falsehood&#146;). Others have pointed out that Porson loved a good fight, in which he could display his learning and his wit. The timing of his intervention in a controversy that had been running since 1782 suggests, however, that there was a deeper motivation for Porson's energetic and enthusiastic engagement in the debate. Approaching the end of his fellowship in 1792, Porson had to decide whether to enter the church and the controversy offered a way in which he could try to work out in his own mind the dilemmas regarding the Trinity and the Christian religion in general, without which no truthful man would be able to take the oath required for holy ordination. If Porson did not persuade Travis about the errors of the controversial verse, it seems obvious that he did persuade himself that he could not take orders, even if it meant losing his fellowship at Trinity. He once commented that one needed fifty years of study to give proper consideration to matters of religion.<br>
<br>Porson subsequently distanced himself further from Anglican orthodoxy by aligning himself with the Unitarians. In one of his incidental poems he ridicules Thomas Kipling, a deputy regius professor of divinity who was subordinate to Bishop Richard Watson. Justifiably considered by Porson to be ignorant as well as orthodox to the point of bigotry, Kipling was publishing a facsimile of the great <span class="italic">Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis</span>, a manuscript of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> (circa fifth century) but also a very controversial one, because of textual differences between it and &#145;normal&#146; <span class="roman">New Testament</span> text. In his poem Porson writes:<blockquote>
<div>Orthodoxy's staunch adherent,<br>
</div>
<div>Bishop Watson's great Vice-gerent,<br>
</div>
<div>Sub-professor Dr. Kipling,<br>
</div>
<div>Leave off your Yorkshire trick of tippling;<br>
</div>
<div>For while thy Beza is in hand,<br>
</div>
<div>Man's salvation's at a stand.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Kipling's bad Latin was proverbial (a &#145;Kiplingism&#146; became synonymous with an execrable grammatical mistake). More importantly, Kipling was one of the leaders of the university prosecution of William Frend, attacked for sedition and for his openly Unitarian views. Porson's own sympathies in the matter can be seen glistening beneath the surface of his rhymes.<br>
<br>One of the most famous Porson anecdotes originated in this period. Porson was being told by someone that the proof of the Trinity would be found when three persons (that is, the deity) could be found riding in one buggy (that is, the godhead). Porson instantly and incisively replied that such proof would actually be forthcoming only when one person was seen to be riding in three buggies. He presumably saw insuperable problems with the first of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> which posits a &#145;godhead of three persons&#146; but he uttered his doubts no more openly than in this apparent mathematical jest.<h2>
<a name="Classicaleditions"></a>Classical editions</h2>Having reached a workable compromise, at least within himself, on the matter of religion, Porson then produced a series of serious critical works on the classics, mainly in the field of Greek drama, by which he secured his scholarly reputation for generations. He began a famous edition of four plays of Euripides in 1797, with <span class="italic">Hecuba</span> (1797), <span class="italic">Orestes</span> (1798), <span class="italic">Phoenissae</span> (1799), and <span class="italic">Medea</span> (1801), the first in the series to bear his name. In his second edition of <span class="italic">Hecuba</span>, he includes a supplement to the preface in which he sets forth and illustrates Porson's law.<br>
<br>Porson spent about a year laboriously transcribing in his own calligraphic handwriting the entire 15,000-line <span class="italic">Codex Galeanus</span> text of the lexicon of Photius, the ninth-century Byzantine scholar and patriarch, eponymous with the Photian schism between the Latin and Greek churches and a vigorous denouncer of the <i>Filioque</i> clause (&#145;And the Son&#146;), followed in the Nicene&#150;Constantinopolitan creed and in the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. When Porson's transcription of the lexicon was destroyed by fire about 1796 he stoically repeated his prior meticulous work.<br>
<br>Porson also worked on Homer, Aristophanes, Pausanias, and Suidas, and the results were published by his friends, after his death, as were his transcript of Photius (1822) and his conjectural restoration of the Rosetta stone (1812). This was in addition to his work on the lexicons of Suidas and Hesychius, his collation of the Harleian manuscripts of the <span class="roman">Odyssey</span> (1801), and his many notes on Athenaeus and on various Greek poets, which were published as <span class="italic">Adversaria</span> (1812).<br>
<br>Porson's work immediately earned him a European reputation as a careful, patient, insightful scholar whose vast fund of knowledge yielded numerous emendations to corrupt texts and wise conjectures which have rarely left room for improvement. He was brilliant but cautious and declined to produce an edition of Aeschylus, as he could not base it on the Medicean manuscript. His handwritten text for <span class="italic">Medea</span> and <span class="italic">Phoenissae</span> formed the basis for the Porson Greek type, first used by Cambridge University Press in 1809 for a few words in Edward Daniel Clarke's <span class="italic">Greek Marbles brought from the Shores of the Euxine, Archipelagi, and Mediterranean</span>; the first full text to use it was the Cambridge edition of <span class="italic">Prometheus</span> in 1809, followed by its use for other plays of Euripides.<h2>
<a name="Ephemeralandhumorouswritings"></a>Ephemeral and humorous writings</h2>Meanwhile, Porson did not neglect the literature and topics of his own day. Besides numerous contributions to the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, many submitted pseudonymously, he wrote hundreds of epigrams and light poems, often with classical allusions of a somewhat boyish humour, such as:<blockquote>
<div>When Dido found Aeneas would not come,<br>
</div>
<div>She mourned in silence and was Di-do-dum.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He wrote a longer piece in 1787 about Sir John Hawkins's <span class="italic">Life of Johnson</span> which was read in his day and considered a model of parody, in the style of Jonathan Swift. He also wrote a variety of political tracts, of which the best-known was <span class="italic">A New Catechism for the Use of the Swinish Multitude</span> (1792), in which Porson expresses strong Jacobinical sentiments, as he also did in an unknown number of unsigned articles printed in the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, that were often recognized by his contemporaries as coming from his pen. He wrote miscellaneous literary criticism, sometimes in prose and sometimes in verse. Of Robert Southey's unreadable narrative poem &#145;Madoc&#146; (1805) he was reported by Byron as having said that &#145;it will be read when &hellip; Homer and Vergil are forgotten &hellip; but not until then&#146;. Porson could also make fun of himself in the same light sarcastic vein, writing:<blockquote>
<div>I went to Strassburg and got drunk<br>
</div>
<div>With that most learn'd professor, Brunck;<br>
</div>
<div>I went to Wortz, and got more drunken<br>
</div>
<div>With that more learn'd professor, Ruhnken.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He here refers to two eminent classicists, Richard Brunck, of Strasbourg, and David Ruhnken, a German who spent most of his time at Leiden, contemporary with Porson. Ruhnken, in fact, was a pioneer of serious classical studies in Germany at a time of which Porson quipped that, in general, &#145;Germans in Greek are sadly to seek.&#146; Porson admired Brunck for his courage in making original corrections to otherwise unintelligible Greek texts and he admired Ruhnken for making great progress in freeing many Greek texts from Christian theological interpretation. As often is the case, Porson's levity conceals a mind keenly aware of the serious but able to retain objective distance, through subtle or obscure humour, even with respect to those ideas and persons which he deeply admired.<br>
<br>Porson considered Gibbon's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span> one of the greatest of modern books, but he was not above quipping that &#145;there could be no better exercise for a schoolboy than to turn a page of it into English&#146;. In a more serious vein, he wrote what is unquestionably one of the best book reviews of the eighteenth century, a one-page model of making his point with a degree of insight, sarcasm, and elegance which is the equal of Gibbon himself; it was published in the preface to the <span class="italic">Letters to Travis</span>. Gibbon's reserve and primness did not accord very well with Porson's rather caustic (but correct) analysis and although Gibbon expressed gratitude for Porson's efforts to expose Travis to the world he did not take so well to the same skills being turned on himself.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsanddeath"></a>Final years and death</h2>In April 1806 Porson became principal librarian of the London Institution, on a salary of &pound;200 per annum, plus a set of rooms at 8 Old Jewry, and a servant. There he apparently carried out his strange mixture of solitary scholarship, solitary and communal inebriety, steady flashes of brilliant classical scholarship, and a ready flow of wit deemed worthy of remembrance, until the end of his life.<br>
<br>On 19 September 1808, while walking near the Strand, Porson collapsed in a fit and was taken to a nearby workhouse, since his identity was not readily ascertainable and, when not actually unconscious, his speech was paralysed and incoherent. A newspaper report of the event on the following day&#151;describing his appearance, his clothes, and some scraps of Greek and algebra found in his pockets&#151;brought forth immediate attention from several of his friends. They attended him until he died in his rooms at the London Institution on 25 September, aged forty-eight. Before he died he regained sufficient of his former intellectual acuteness to recite at length in Greek, as if it were his native tongue. The cause of death was possibly a subdural haematoma. He was buried on 3 October in Trinity College chapel, Cambridge, in a funeral ceremony with considerable pomp and sorrow, which was attended by many eminences of the day. His tomb lies at the foot of Isaac Newton's statue and is not far from the remains of Bentley. Burney and his friends erected a plaque to his memory with a simple Latin inscription.<h2>
<a name="Library"></a>Library</h2>Much of Porson's library was auctioned by Leigh and Sotheby over seven days in June 1809 in 1351 lots; it realized the sum of &pound;1254; Burney was among the purchasers. The remainder of the library was acquired by Trinity College for about 1000 guineas, together with many of Porson's manuscripts, and is still intact. The quality, beauty, and value of the books that were auctioned are indisputable. In addition to more than fifteen editions from the Aldine Press, there were numerous later editions, such as from the Foulis Press in Glasgow, that are principally valued for their typography. Others, such as the Grenville Homer, realized almost three times the amount of Porson's annual income as regius professor. Convincing evidence that he was still deeply engaged in scholarship in his last years is provided by the dates of many of the books, some of which were published as late as 1805 to 1808. In addition to a great number of books containing annotated texts of the Greek and Roman classics, there was an exceptionably large number of dictionaries and glossaries. There were also many bibles, religious works, Bayle's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, books on calligraphy (including two copies of John Hodgkin's <span class="italic">Calligraphica Graeca</span>, 1794 and 1807, to which Porson was a subscriber), plus many volumes of Shakespeare, Milton, Pope, Swift, Johnson, Locke, and Gibbon. Among the numerous unexpected items was a copy of Beccaria's <span class="italic">Crimes and Punishments</span> in Greek.<h2>
<a name="Legacyandreputation"></a>Legacy and reputation</h2>Some two hundred years after his death, Porson survives in numerous small ways, seldom accorded to any classical scholar, however eminent. There is a Porson Road in Cambridge, fittingly placed parallel to Bentley Road. As well as Porson's law, there is Porson's bridge, which asserts that a word with a final heavy syllable may not implement third anceps in Archilochus, Semonides, Solon, or the Greek tragedians but may be found in Hipponax and the comedians. A Porson prize and Porson scholarship exist, both of which were first administered by Burney and funded by the capital from which Porson declined to accept anything but the annual interest. The Porson prize has been awarded since 1817 for the best translation into classical Greek verse (of a specified rhythmic type) of a text from the Elizabethan dramatists, often Shakespeare but also Marlowe, Jonson, Massinger, and others, and did much to arouse interest in England for academic Greek versification. Among the winners of the prize have been Sir John Edwin Sandys and Sir Richard Claverhouse Jebb, author of the biography of Porson (1896) in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. The Porson scholarship has been awarded since 1855 and has been conferred upon Jebb (1859), among others. Porson's reading chair, his tobacco pot, and a few other minor mementoes are preserved at Trinity. Good life portraits of him exist, by Hoppner and by John Opie, as well as a miniature attributed to George Engleheart, and there is a bust of him by Sir Francis Chantrey in Trinity College chapel.<br>
<br>Porson's great work, the textual emendations, have entered the mainstream and his scholarship, academic integrity, and originality have never been doubted. However, his rarefied focus on the minutiae of metre and textual criticism has not kept pace with a world where the Attic dramatists are most commonly read in modern language translations which obliterate the very linguistic mysteries Porson laboured so hard to elucidate.<br>
<br>Although Porson taught no pupils and founded no lasting &#145;school&#146; of literary, or even of textual, criticism, in the generation just after his death he had a number of followers who were proud to have their names linked with his. His &#145;disciples&#146;, such as Charles James Blomfield, Peter Paul Dobree, Thomas Kidd, and James Henry Monk, were a group of Trinity men so closely bound by their excessive Porsonian devotion as to be dubbed the &#145;Porsonulettes&#146; and edited and published many of their master's unfinished projects. The Porson &#145;industry&#146; seems to have peaked by about 1867, with the publication of Porson's correspondence by Henry Richards Luard, registrar of the University of Cambridge and author of the Porson biography for the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>; it was later revised by John Edwin Sandys for the eleventh edition. After that, the anecdotal side of the Porson persona tended to predominate and no serious original work on him was done until 1937, with the publication of M. L. Clarke's biographical study.<br>
<br>Porson's reputation has been compromised by his much publicized propensity to drink. Gossip about his excessive drinking was circulated by the numerous anecdotal biographies and sensational newspaper obituaries which appeared shortly after his melodramatic death. Ten years later, in a letter of 20 February 1818 to the publisher John Murray, Lord Byron referred to Porson's &#145;bestial intoxication&#146; at Cambridge, yet admitted that he had more often seen Porson sober than drunk. In his own lifetime Porson's name served as a byword either for the pinnacle of scholarship or for the depths of drunkenness and wasted talent.<br>
<br>Perhaps Porson's most lasting legacy resides in that most characteristic expression of his better self&#151;his Greek handwriting. It is elegant, it is sensitive, it is self-confident, it is a visual embodiment of all the best which the reader hopes from the best ideas within the text. Porson type is now the most commonly printed font for classical Greek text in the English-speaking world and is likely to continue as such for centuries. It is directly copied from Porson's own manuscript. His handwriting was deemed so perfect that the punches were said to have been cut directly, by Richard Austin, of the Cambridge University Press, between 1806 and 1808, from Porson's own script and under his own supervision, and &#145;Porson Greek&#146; is a great improvement over the wiry curlicues of the Aldines and the ambiguity of Granjon, Plantin, Estienne, and other predecessors. First used to print a classical text in Blomfield's Cambridge edition of <span class="italic">Prometheus vinctus</span> (1810), it has become one of the most familiar type fonts for all students of the Greek classics.<br>
