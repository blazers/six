<span class="headword">Faber,  George Stanley</span>  (1773&#150;1854), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, the eldest son of the Revd Thomas Faber (1730&#150;1821), vicar of Calverley, Yorkshire, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Traviss (<i>b</i>. 1745), was born at Calverley parsonage on 25 October 1773. Frederick William Faber, convert to Catholicism and founder of the London Oratory, was his nephew. He was educated at the Hipperholme grammar school, near Halifax, where he remained until he went to university. On 10 June 1789 he matriculated at University College, Oxford, and was elected a scholar of Lincoln College, Oxford, on 25 March 1790, where he was awarded his BA degree and elected a fellow and tutor in 1793. He proceeded MA in 1796 and BD in 1803, and became proctor in 1801. He came to general notice through his <span class="italic">Two sermons before the University of Oxford: an attempt to explain by recent events five of the seven vials mentioned in the Revelations</span> (1799). As Bampton lecturer in the same year, he published a paper, <span class="italic">Horae Mosaicae, or, A view of the Mosaical records with respect to their coincidence with profane antiquity and their connection with Christianity</span>, on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>.<br>
<br>On 31 May 1803 Faber married Eliza Sophia Scott-Waring (1776&#150;1851), a philanthropist; they had five children. Since fellows of Oxford colleges were not allowed to marry, he resigned his fellowship and became assistant curate to his father at Calverley. After two years, in 1805, he was made vicar of Stockton-on-Tees. He later served as rector at Redmarshall (1809&#150;11) and at Long Newton (1811&#150;32). He became prebendary at Salisbury Cathedral in 1830, and Bishop van Mildert appointed him master of Sherburn Hospital in 1832. After resigning his post at Long Newton, he spent a good deal of his own income at Sherburn on the successful improvement of the hospital estates.<br>
<br>Faber's brand of Anglicanism was strongly evangelical, and he stressed the protestant doctrines of the necessity of conversion, justification by faith, and the sole authority of scripture as the rule of faith. As a result of his opinions and his writings, he became friendly with Bishop Burgess, Bishop van Mildert, Bishop Barrington, the marquess of Bath, Lord Bexley, and Dr Routh. His writings on <span class="italic">The Origin of Pagan Idolatry</span> (1816) attempted to demonstrate, mainly through the evidence of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, that all pagan nations had worshipped the same gods who, he argued, were in fact men who had been deified by simple people. The origins of their errors stemmed from the Tower of Babel and Noah's three sons. He also gave his Bampton lectures on the so-called &#145;Arkite Egg&#146;, a subject which he also discussed elsewhere. His treatises on <span class="roman">Revelation</span> and on the seven vials, prophetic interpretations which included predictions of the restoration of Napoleon in 1815, were old-fashioned approaches in the Church of England of his day. His books on the primitive doctrines of election and justification were noteworthy insofar as they stressed the evangelical view of these doctrines, in opposition to the opinion of contemporary writers of very different schools such as Vicesimus Knox and Joseph Milner. Faber's wife, Eliza, died at their home, Sherburn House, on 28 October 1851, and he died at Sherburn Hospital, near Durham, on 27 January 1854. He was buried in the chapel of the hospital on 1 February.<br>
<br>Faber's less well-known works include <span class="italic">A dissertation on the mysteries of the Cabiri, or, The great gods of Phoenicia, Samothrace, Egypt, Troas, Greece, Italy, and Crete</span> (2 vols., 1803), <span class="italic">A dissertation on the prophecies relative to the great period of 1200 years, the papal and Mahomedan apostasies, the reign of Antichrist, and the restoration of the Jews</span> (2 vols., 1807; 5th edn, 1814&#150;18), <span class="italic">A general and connected view of the prophecies relative to the conversion of Judah and Israel, the overthrow of the confederacy in Palestine, and the diffusion of Christianity</span> (2 vols., 1808), <span class="italic">A practical treatise on the ordinary operations of the Holy Spirit</span> (1813), and <span class="italic">Remarks on the fifth apocalyptic vial and the restoration of the imperial government of France</span> (1815). Controversial works included <span class="italic">The difficulties of infidelity</span> (1824), <span class="italic">The difficulties of Romanism</span> (1826), <span class="italic">A treatise on the origin of expiatory sacrifice</span> (1827), <span class="italic">The testimony of antiquity against the peculiarities of the Latin church</span> (1828), <span class="italic">Letters on Catholic emancipation</span> (1829), <span class="italic">The apostolicity of trinitarianism: the testimony of history to the antiquity and to the apostolical inculcation of the doctrine of the holy Trinity</span> (2 vols., 1832), <span class="italic">The primitive doctrine of justification investigated, relatively to the definitions of the Church of Rome and the Church of England</span> (1837), <span class="italic">Christ's discourse at Capernaum fatal to the doctrine of transubstantiation on the very principle of exposition adopted by the divines of the Roman church</span> (1840), <span class="italic">Letters on Tractarian secessions to popery</span> (1846), and <span class="italic">Papal infallibility: a letter to a dignitary of the church of Rome</span> (1851).<br>
