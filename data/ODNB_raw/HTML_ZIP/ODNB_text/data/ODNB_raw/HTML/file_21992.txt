<span class="headword">Perry,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1765), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born at Abingdon, Berkshire, and apprenticed to a hosier, but, showing some aptitude for art, he was placed first with one of the Vanderbanks, and afterwards with Richardson, to study painting. Having made no progress in this he became clerk to a commissary, whom he accompanied to Lichfield, and there made drawings of the cathedral, which he subsequently etched. Eventually he devoted himself to drawing and engraving topographical views and antiquities, working chiefly for magazines. He engraved two views of the cloisters of St Katharine by the Tower for Dr A. C. Ducarel's paper of 1790 on that church in Nichols's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span>, <span class="italic">A Collection of Eighteen Views of Antiquities in the County of Kent</span>, and portraits of Matthew Hutton, archbishop of York; of Dr Ducarel, after A. Soldi; and of Dr Thomas Hyde, after Cipriani.<br>
<br>Perry is best known, however, for his engravings of coins and medals, which he executed with great neatness and accuracy. The sixteen plates in Ducarel's <span class="italic">Anglo-Gallic Coins</span> (1757) are by Perry, and he also worked for the numismatist Thomas Snelling. In 1762 he began publication of a series of gold and silver British medals, of which three parts, containing ten plates, appeared before his death and a fourth posthumously. In 1764 he exhibited with the Free Society of Artists his print of Dr Hyde and a pen-and-ink view at Walworth. Perry had the use of only one eye and habitually etched on a white ground, which facilitated his working by candlelight. Though painstaking and industrious he could only earn a precarious living. At the time of his death, on 3 January 1765, he was unmarried and living in Carter Lane, south of St Paul's Cathedral. He was buried in Bunhill Fields on 7 January. His prints, coins, and medals, and some china were auctioned on 8 April, his estate being administered by a cousin.<br>
