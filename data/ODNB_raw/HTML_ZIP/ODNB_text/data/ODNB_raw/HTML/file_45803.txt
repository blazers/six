<span class="headword">Larcher,  Dorothy Mary</span>  (1882&#150;1952), <span class="occ">flower painter, designer, and textile printer</span>, was born on 28 September 1882 at 47 Shirlock Road, St Pancras, London, the daughter and (presumed) only child of William Gustavus Francis Larcher, schoolmaster, and his wife, Eliza Pearce, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Arkell. Active during the 1920s and 1930s, she produced with her partner, the designer and printer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45801/', "(Mabel) Phyllis Barron (1890&#150;1964)")</script>, innovative hand block-printed materials that had &#145;a perfect harmony between the fibre, the dye and the block&#146;  (Bosence, 42).<blockquote>Despite the peculiarly English feel of these textiles, they were in complete contrast to what was generally being produced in Britain in the interwar years for dress and upholstery. They stand apart even when compared to the few other well-established contemporary hand block-printed textiles that were available, such as those of Alec Walker for Crysede or Joyce Clissold at Footprints, where designs were often on a smaller scale and the results frequently busier and more fragmented, often employing more colours. (Roscoe, ed. Coatts, 61)</blockquote>Larcher studied fine art at Hornsey School of Art, London, where she also later taught. In 1914 she accompanied Lady Christiana Herringham to India to help record the Buddhist frescoes in the Ajanta caves; subsequently she taught and lived with an Indian family in Calcutta, as the outbreak of war prevented her return to England until 1921. No doubt it was in India that she first saw textiles being printed by hand. Back in London &#145;she visited the Brook Street Gallery and was charmed with Barron's simple hand block-printed textiles. They met, and later &hellip; decided to work together&#146;  (Bosence, 45). Initially Dorothy Larcher &#145;joined Barron's workshop in Hampstead High Street. Soon afterwards they moved to 2 Parkhill Studios in Parkhill Road and shared a flat together which was practically next door&#146;  (Roscoe, ed. Coatts, 64&#150;5).<br>
<br>In 1930 Larcher and Barron moved to Hambutts House, Edge Road, Painswick, Gloucestershire. The etcher and educationist Robin Tanner recorded his first visit in 1938. Describing Larcher as &#145;small&#146; but with a &#145;strong personality&#146;, he wrote:<blockquote>She had a rather sad, quiet voice and a serious manner, though her sense of humour was every bit as keen as Barron's. She too was most beautifully dressed. She wore cotton printed in iron rust in her own design called <i>Old Flower</i> the very first she ever cut &hellip; [She] was a most distinguished embroideress. (Roscoe, 1993, 123)</blockquote>Whereas Barron tended towards strong geometrical patterns Larcher more often based designs on plant and flower motifs such as <i>Little flower</i> and <i>Basket</i>. Responsibilities in the workshop tended to be divided: &#145;Dorothy Larcher was mainly responsible for the block cutting &hellip; and Barron was very good at dye mixing &hellip; Girls from the village helped with the printing, taught by Dorothy Larcher&#146;  (Bosence, 48).<br>
<br>The Second World War brought an end to production. Hambutts House was sold and Barron and Larcher converted the self-contained workshop into a compact but equally comfortable home called Hambutts. Inspired by special plants from their well-stocked garden &#145;Larcher returned to her flower studies, each one lovingly painted&#151;its character, colour and markings captured in a rare, discreet quality of paint [but] she completed only about forty of her favourite plants before she died&#146;  (Bosence, 48). Her death certificate records that she died of cerebral thrombosis at New Nursing Home, Cainscross Road, Stroud, on 14 August 1952 and that Barron arranged for her burial.<br>
<br>The Crafts Study Centre at the Surrey Institute of Art and Design, University College, Farnham, holds the major collection and archive of Barron's and Larcher's work, presented by Robin and Heather Tanner. Their textiles can also be seen at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester; Cheltenham Museums and Art Gallery; and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.<br>
