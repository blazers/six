<span class="headword">Fargus,  Frederick John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Hugh Conway]</span>  (1847&#150;1885), <span class="occ">poet and novelist</span>, was born at Bristol on 26 December 1847, the eldest of the three sons of Frederick Charles Fargus (<i>d</i>. 1868), a local auctioneer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marson, who died during their boyhood. Fred Fargus was a quiet, contemplative child, but his boyish passion for the novels of Captain Marryat made him long to be a sailor. His father reluctantly assented to his wish to be entered, when thirteen years old, as a student on board the school frigate <i>Conway</i>, then stationed on the Mersey. Although he made rapid progress there, and in June 1862 won several prizes for academic achievement, his desire to enter the Royal Navy soon cooled, and he was placed for a time at a private school in Bristol.<br>
<br>On leaving school Fargus was articled to W. H. Williams &amp; Co., a firm of public accountants in Bristol, in whose office he remained until his father's death on 14 April 1868. He then joined his uncle H. R. Fargus as an auctioneer in the family business, where he worked until he achieved fame as a writer in 1883. He was known as a good judge of art, curiosities, china, and bric-&agrave;-brac, and as such was employed to value and catalogue the Strawberry Hill collection on the death of Countess Waldegrave. On 26 August 1871 Fargus married Amy, the youngest daughter of Alderman Spark JP, of Bristol; they had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>As a schoolboy of seventeen Fargus had written a burlesque, &#145;Jason, or, The Golden Fleece&#146;, which impressed the company then performing at the Bristol Theatre. While still a clerk, he began to write lyrical poems, and a collection was published in 1879 as <span class="italic">A Life's Idylls and other Poems</span>. Many of his verses were set to music, &#145;Some Day&#146; (1880), with music by Joseph Milton Wellings, being perhaps the most popular. These poems and songs appeared under the signature Hugh Conway, in memory of his old school frigate on the Mersey, and soon afterwards he began to write short tales of mystery and the supernatural using the same pseudonym. &#145;The Daughter of the Stars&#146; was the first to be published in late 1881, in a collection of tales entitled <span class="italic">Thirteen at Dinner</span>, the earliest of the series of <span class="roman">Christmas Annuals</span> from Bristol publisher J. W. Arrowsmith. Soon Fargus's stories were appearing regularly in metropolitan miscellanies like <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span> as well as in provincial newspapers such as the local <span class="italic">Bristol Times</span> or the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Post</span>, which carried the serial novel &#145;The Redhills Mystery&#146; in 1883. In Margaret Oliphant's judgement, however, of his early stories, collected in two volumes under the title <span class="italic">Bound together</span> in 1884, the best were those which appeared in the Edinburgh monthly <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>, beginning with &#145;The Secret of the Stradivarius&#146; in December 1881.<br>
<br>But it was the unexpected popular success of the novella <span class="italic">Called back</span> which brought Fargus international fame. This gripping tale of blindness, amnesia, and murder, of political conspiracy in Italy and political exile in Siberia, appeared in late 1883 as the third of Arrowsmith's <span class="roman">Christmas Annuals</span>. Only about half of the initial edition of 6000 had been sold by the end of the holiday season, but, owing in part to an enthusiastic notice in <span class="italic">Truth</span> (3 January 1884), 30,000 copies were cleared by March 1884. According to the original agreement Fargus ceded the entire copyright of <span class="italic">Called back</span> to Arrowsmith for only &pound;80. However, on the success of the book, this was cancelled by mutual consent and a royalty was paid for a period of six years. Frequently reprinted as a paperback in Arrowsmith's <span class="roman">Bristol Library</span>, by summer 1887 over 350,000 copies of the book had been sold throughout the British empire. A much larger number were undoubtedly printed in various unauthorized editions in the United States, and the story was quickly translated into all the major European languages. Contemporary commentators tended to compare the story to Wilkie Collins's sensation novels of the 1860s, but readers are now more likely to recognize <span class="italic">Called back</span> as one of the first examples of the modern best-selling thriller.<br>
<br>The story was dramatized by J. Comyns Carr in collaboration with the author, and opened on 20 May 1884 at the Prince's (later Prince of Wales's) Theatre in London, where it ran for almost 200 performances. The success of <span class="italic">Called back</span> led Fargus to quit his job as an auctioneer and move to London. This followed a banquet given on 12 June 1884 by the mayor of Bristol to celebrate the local author's triumph. Success also led to a large number of offers of remunerative literary work which Fargus clearly struggled to fulfil. In addition to regular contributions to metropolitan periodicals, Fargus agreed to write further <span class="roman">Christmas Annuals</span> for Arrowsmiths and promised a series of short stories to Tillotsons Fiction Bureau in Bolton. His most highly paid effort was probably the serial <span class="italic">Living or Dead</span>, sold for &pound;1200 to W. C. Leng &amp; Co. of Sheffield, who were starting a rival fiction syndication agency centred on their <span class="italic">Weekly Telegraph</span>. The most popular work was probably the 1884 Arrowsmiths <span class="roman">Annual</span> <span class="italic">Dark Days</span>. This was also dramatized and widely translated, and provoked a parody in Andrew Lang's <span class="italic">Even Darker Days</span>, also issued in 1884 under the pseudonym A. Huge Longway. Fargus's most complex narrative was <span class="italic">A Family Affair</span>, which combines the mechanisms of enigma and suspense with delicate social comedy. It was serialized in the <span class="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</span> from October 1884. Much of Fargus's fiction did not appear in volume form until after his death. In addition to collections of short tales, and the 1885 Arrowsmiths <span class="roman">Christmas Annual</span> <span class="italic">Slings and Arrows</span>, the posthumous books included three triple-decker novels, <span class="italic">A Family Affair</span> (1885), <span class="italic">Living or Dead</span> (1886), and <span class="italic">A Cardinal Sin</span> (1886), which was &#145;The Redhills Mystery&#146; under a new title.<br>
<br>Although Fargus wrote with great fluency, this excess of literary labour seems to have led to physical exhaustion. Early in 1885 Fargus showed symptoms of tuberculosis and was advised to seek rest and recuperation in a sunnier climate. While in the Riviera in the spring, following visits to Milan, Florence, and Rome, he was diagnosed as suffering from typhoid fever. When convalescent, he caught a chill, suffered a relapse, and died at Monte Carlo on 15 May 1885. On 18 May he was buried in the cemetery at Nice. An epitaph by Lord Houghton placed over his grave describes him as &#145;A British writer of fiction of great renown and greater promise, who died prematurely&#146;. A memorial tablet in his honour was erected by public subscription in Bristol Cathedral.<br>
