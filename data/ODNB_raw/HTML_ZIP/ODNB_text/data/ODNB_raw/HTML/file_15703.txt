<span class="headword">Knatchbull, Sir  Norton</span>, first baronet  (1602&#150;1685), <span class="occ">politician and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 26 December 1602, the eldest surviving son of Thomas Knatchbull (1572&#150;1623) of Maidstone and his wife, Eleanor (1574&#150;1638), daughter of John Astley, master of the revels. He was educated at Eton College from 1615 to 1618, matriculated at Cambridge as a fellow-commoner of St John's College on 20 March 1619, and graduated BA in 1620. In 1624, as his father and uncles had done, he entered the Middle Temple, London. On 22 October 1630 he married Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Westrowe, member of the Grocers' Company and alderman of London. They had thirteen children. His uncle Sir Norton Knatchbull of Mersham Hatch, Kent, sheriff of that county in 1608 and MP for Hythe in 1609, had founded the free school at Ashford. The younger Norton succeeded to the family estate on the death of his uncle in 1636. He confirmed the deed of endowment for the school of &pound;30 per annum and subsequently added to the buildings.<br>
<br>In 1639 Knatchbull was elected member of parliament for New Romney, Kent, and was knighted at Whitehall in London by Charles I. He was made a baronet on 4 August 1641. Although originally inclined towards the opposition to Charles I, he was summoned in November 1642 with twenty-seven others to appear before the House of Commons as a delinquent, and in the following year he was fined 1000 marks for neglecting his services to the house and the county committee. His considerable delay in taking the covenant reflected his distaste for the militant presbyterianism it represented. Knatchbull did not sit in the house after Pride's Purge, and occupied himself instead with his Hebrew studies.<br>
<br>In 1659 Knatchbull published <span class="italic">Animadversiones in libros novi testamenti</span>. The work demonstrates a considerable breadth of learning, reflecting the author's use of his large library. It is also intrepid in its arguments for considering historical circumstances and contemporary idiom, and for suggesting the existence of scribal errors in the transmission of the sacred text. A second edition with appendix was published in 1672 and a third, emended, at Oxford in 1677; a fourth edition, in English, appeared in 1692, entitled <span class="italic">Annotations upon some Difficult Texts in All the Books of the New Testament</span> (Cambridge, 1693). The preface states that Knatchbull undertook the translation, probably shortly before his death. It is preceded by an &#145;Encomiastick upon the most Learned and Judicious Author&#146;, by Thomas Walker of Sidney Sussex College. The work was well received in England and abroad, was reprinted on the continent, and was held in high regard well into the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1660 Knatchbull's New Romney constituency honoured him by electing him together with his son on condition that they both took out their freedom. Knatchbull sat on only five committees in the Convention, and probably voted with the court. Re-elected in 1661, he participated more actively in the Cavalier Parliament, but he did not take part in formulating the Clarendon code or in later measures against its deviser. By now a widower, he married on 27 November 1662 Dorothy, daughter of Sir Robert Honeywood of Charing, Kent, widow of Sir Edward Steward of Barking, Essex, who survived him. They had no children. In 1669 Sir Thomas Osborne identified him as one of the members to be engaged by the duke of Buckingham. Owing to advancing years he probably did not attend any sessions after 1673. In December 1675 Sir Richard Wiseman listed him as a probable government supporter, recording his recent absence, and in 1677 Lord Shaftesbury marked him &#145;doubly vile&#146;, probably because his younger son was secretary to Lord Chancellor Finch  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1660&#150;90</span>, 692).<br>
<br>In 1680 Pierre du Moulin the younger dedicated to Knatchbull his <span class="italic">Short view of the chief points in controversy between the reformed churches and the church of Rome</span>, a translation from an unprinted manuscript by his father, Pierre du Moulin the elder. Knatchbull had acquired the manuscript for his collection and handed it over for the purposes of publication. Du Moulin praised Knatchbull's combination of piety and learning well known to the world.<br>
<br>Knatchbull died at Mersham Hatch on 3 February 1685 and was buried in the family vault under the chancel of Mersham church, where a Latin epitaph styled him <i>Criticorum coryphaeus et oraculum</i>, comparing his eloquence with that of Cicero and Chrysostom and his judgement with that of Varro and Jerome. In his will he left considerable sums to the poor around his estate, and the sum of &pound;40 to his servant Francis. The estate passed to his eldest son, John.<br>
