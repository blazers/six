<span class="headword">Viotti,  Giovanni Battista</span>  (1755&#150;1824), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born in Fontanetto da Po, Piedmont, Italy, on 12 May 1755, possibly the illegitimate son of Antonio Viotti, a blacksmith and amateur horn player, and Maria Magdelena Milano. His early instruction may have come from his father and, when he was eleven, from Giovanni, a lutenist in Fontanetto. Viotti's talents were discovered while he was playing at a church festival at Strambino in 1766. He impressed a bishop who was present and who recommended him as a companion to the young Alfonso dal Pozzo, prince of Cisterna. They travelled to Turin, where Viotti came to the attention of Colgnetti, a musician at the royal court of Sardinia-Piedmont; he persuaded the prince's father, the marchese di Vogliera, to take responsibility for Viotti's welfare and further education. After tuition with Antonio Celoniat, Viotti studied with Gaetano Pugnani, the principal exponent of the school of violin playing begun by Arcangelo Corelli; Pugnani returned from London in 1770 to become first violinist in the king's music at Turin.<br>
<br>After five years (1775&#150;80) at the back of the first violins in the orchestra of the royal chapel in Turin, Viotti embarked on a concert tour with Pugnani. From early 1780 they travelled to Switzerland, Dresden, and on to Berlin, where his first publication, a concerto in A (now known as no. 3) was published in 1781. From there they visited (via Warsaw) St Petersburg, then returned to Berlin towards the end of 1781. It was now important for Viotti to establish himself in his own right, and he made the journey to Paris alone.<br>
<br>Viotti's remarkably successful d&eacute;but at the Concert Spirituel took place on 17 March 1782, following which he remained in great demand and in high critical esteem for the next year and a half. He then turned his back on public performance for a time and was appointed Queen Marie Antoinette's accompanist at Versailles, with a life pension of &pound;150, in January 1784. In the following year, while living with his friend the musician Luigi Cherubini, Viotti held private academies on Sunday mornings for fellow musicians, which often featured his own latest compositions. With the patronage of Louis-Stanislas-Xavier, comte de Provence, brother of Louis XVI, Viotti built in 1788 the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de Monsieur (later the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Feydeau), which he ran to great effect. Following the revolution the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de Monsieur closed, and Viotti moved opera performances to the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Foire St Germain, but they proved less successful there.<br>
<br>Viotti's Parisian period had been immensely productive and influential, but his close association with the court came to threaten not only his livelihood but also his life, and to escape the hostility of the Jacobins he abandoned Paris for London, arriving in July 1792. He established himself as a teacher, but once again made his greatest impact as a performer. His d&eacute;but at Johann Peter Salomon's Hanover Square concert on 7 February 1793, playing his twenty-first violin concerto, was a huge success, and he became the primary violinist of the series for two seasons. He returned briefly to Paris in July 1793, on the death of his mother, before going back to London (via Switzerland, Germany, and Flanders) in December. He was living at 34 Wells Street, Oxford Street, in 1794. Viotti came into contact with Haydn about this time, playing at his benefit concerts in 1794 and 1795. He also became musical director and a performer at the new opera concerts in 1795 and managed Italian opera at the King's Theatre during the 1794&#150;5 season. The connection with the King's endured (his salary was &pound;300 during 1795&#150;6), and he took Wilhelm Cramer's position as leader and director of the orchestra in 1797. Often to be found performing in the homes of the social &eacute;lite, he enjoyed an assured position as the foremost violinist in London.<br>
<br>Viotti's fortunes, however, took a distinct turn for the worse soon afterwards. On 20 February 1798 he was replaced as leader at the King's Theatre by Salomon, and, suspected of Jacobin activity, he was ordered to leave Great Britain the following month. Despite his written protestations to the contrary and the flimsy evidence, amounting to little more than that he still had correspondents in France, the order stood. He stayed in Schenfeldt, near Hamburg, for a year and a half, the guest of the Chinnery family, musical English friends from London. Viotti continued to work during this difficult period, publishing a set of duos, op. 5, dedicated to William Chinnery, and teaching; his pupils included the influential German music teacher Friedrich Wilhelm Pixis.<br>
<br>In July 1799 he left Germany, and he returned to London at some time before 1801. Viotti had been involved with the wine trade before his exile, and this became his primary focus on his return, although he continued to compose and publish new works and perform privately. The Chinnery family remained close friends, and he was often a guest performer at Gilwell, their country house near Stewardstone in Epping Forest, Essex. There were also visits to Paris in 1802 and 1814, and he was a founder member of the London Philharmonic Society in 1813, although his performances for that body were infrequent. The London-born Nicolas Mori, the first violin professor at the Royal Academy of Music, was a pupil of Viotti about this time.<br>
<br>Viotti's wine business folded in 1818, and Paris apparently offered more possibilities for continuing his musical career and repaying some of his debts. His former patron, the comte de Provence, was now Louis XVIII. A performance of one of his own concertos at a reception held in his honour was received enthusiastically, and he was appointed director of the Paris Op&eacute;ra on 1 November 1819 with an annual salary of 12,000 francs. Once again his good fortune was curtailed. This time the assassination of the king's nephew Charles-Ferdinand, duc de Berri, at the Op&eacute;ra shortly afterwards (while Viotti was visiting London) created severe difficulties for the company and its director. Viotti finally resigned in November 1821, and, despite his enduring directorship of the Italian theatre in Paris, his financial predicament continued. He made his will in Paris (13 March 1822) and travelled to London in the following year to stay with his old friends the Chinnery family at 17 Montague Street and then at 5 Upper Berkeley Street, Portman Square. He died there on the morning of 3 March 1824, and may have been buried at Stewardstone. He left two violins, a fine 1712 example by Antonio Stradivari, used by Viotti until his death, and a Klotz that once belonged to Mrs Chinnery.<br>
<br>Viotti's will and other documents reveal that his debts (by his own estimation, 80,000 francs and 800 francs to Mrs Chinnery and his brother Andr&eacute; respectively) and &#145;bitter regrets of neglected talent&#146;  (White, &#145;Viotti&#146;) played heavily on his mind during the final period of his life. Despite this inner torment, contemporary accounts and visual representations depict him as physically attractive with a strong, endearing, and refined personality. His personal attributes, integrity, and talents allowed him to rise from humble origins to the highest echelons of musical and social circles in Italy, France, and England. His suspected Jacobin sympathies and a few questionable career decisions did not prevent him from becoming a hugely important and influential figure whose legacy endured through pupils, prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, and their writings. Viotti was an innovator, bridging the gap between the Italian and Franco-Belgian (modern) traditions of violin playing, although this also meant that he was denied the relative security offered to earlier court musicians and to the travelling virtuosos of the following era. His ten &#145;London&#146; concertos combine elements of Haydn's symphonic writing with the qualities of the violin model of Stradivari and the bow developed by Tourte, paving the way for the violin concertos of Beethoven and Brahms. He was sufficiently accomplished as a musician and a virtuoso to develop violin technique and the genre of the violin concerto in general at a time when expressive ideals were in a crucial state of transition. However, modernism and virtuosity were never to be at the expense of lyricism, refinement, and beauty of tone, and these were priorities appreciated by English critics and connoisseurs in particular. Viotti, and later Louis Spohr, represented these qualities in the eyes of the English well into the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Viotti was a prolific composer, mainly for his own instrument. Autographs, sketches, and fragments of his work survive at the Conservatoire National de Musique, Paris, the British Library, and the Conservatorio di Musica Luigi Cherubini, Florence. An increasing number of recordings of his works, in particular the concertos, reflected the ongoing reassessment of their importance and quality at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
