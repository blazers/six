<span class="headword">Peckard,  Peter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1717, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">dean of Peterborough</span>, was baptized on 2 November 1717 at St Margaret in the Close, Lincoln, the son of the Revd John Peckard (1689?&#150;1765) of Welbourn, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1786/7). In his youth he lost an arm in a shooting accident. He matriculated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 20 July 1734, and proved to be a lively undergraduate: he was twice obliged to atone for misdemeanours by public penance on his knees in the college hall. Peckard graduated BA in 1738, proceeded MA in 1742, and became scholaris, or probationary fellow, in 1744. He was ordained deacon on 22 September 1745, and priested on 25 May 1746, by the bishop of Lincoln. On 26 February 1746 he had been instituted to the vicarage of St Martin's, Lincoln, which he held until 1750. From about 1752 to 1760 he was curate of King's Ripton, near Huntingdon.<br>
<br>On 13 June 1755 Peckard married Martha (1729&#150;1805), accounted a local beauty, daughter of Edward Ferrar, a Huntingdon attorney and descendant of Nicholas Ferrar of the Little Gidding community. In 1760 Peckard was appointed rector of Fletton, near Peterborough, through the patronage of Lord Careysfort of the local Proby family, and to the vicarage of Yaxley nearby, a crown living. This pluralism required a dispensation from Thomas Secker, archbishop of Canterbury, who disapproved of Peckard's unorthodoxy as a &#145;mortalist&#146; denying any intermediate state of consciousness between death and the Judgement. Before giving his assent Secker subjected him to rigorous examination in Latin and humiliatingly exacted his signature to four articles which constituted a partial retraction.<br>
<br>For a number of years Peckard combined his parochial responsibilities with those of army chaplaincy, and the <span class="italic">Army List</span> shows him on the strength of the 16th foot from 1755 to 1766, and of the Grenadier Guards from 1766 to 1782, though he evidently held leave of absence for much of the time. In the mess he was reckoned a convivial companion. He held prebends at Lincoln Cathedral from 1774 and Southwell Minster from 1777. In 1777 Peckard vacated Yaxley and was appointed to the rectory of Tansor, Northamptonshire, which he held until 1793. From 1781 until his death he was master of Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was appointed vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1784, created DD in 1785, and in 1792 was appointed dean of Peterborough. He was rector of Abbot's Ripton, Huntingdonshire, from 1793 to 1797.<br>
<br>While a Huntingdonshire curate Peckard incorporated in 1753 as a Cambridge MA, and became associated with the informal circle of liberal Anglican divines who helped make the university a citadel of mid-century latitudinarianism. Propagating his beliefs in a number of tracts and sermons, he covered some of his more heterodox views by a veil of prudent ambiguity or anonymity. Peckard was devout in his way, far from being a deist and bitterly critical of scoffers or sceptics like David Hume, yet his commitment to the principles of <i>sola scriptura</i> and private judgement led him to break with contemporary orthodoxy on several dogmas, including the Trinity, which he saw as a speculative opinion grafted onto the faith by subtle Platonizers. Like some of his friends, he demanded a &#145;further reformation&#146; of the church to make its teachings and liturgy more consonant with the simple rule of life set out in scripture, and thus more defensible against sceptical attack. He strongly criticized the way in which assent to doctrinal confessions (&#145;human impositions&#146;) was made a test of orthodoxy. In 1772, however, he did not sign the Feathers tavern petition to parliament demanding an end to obligatory subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, though he warmly endorsed the principle. He was keenly interested in the last judgment&#151;which he believed might come in 2016&#151;and in God's providential judgement of states and nations in this world. Though his theological views were never set out systematically, they can be pieced together from his various publications, particularly from <span class="italic">Subscription, or, Historical Extracts</span> (1776).<br>
<br>Peckard was strongly committed to whiggish principles of civil and religious liberty. He had a high view of natural rights, government by consent, liberty of conscience, and the need for the periodic review of human institutions. His earliest publication was a defence of the Jewish naturalization bill of 1753. By the early 1780s the focus of his political attention had moved to the anti-slavery cause, of which he became an eloquent supporter. Preaching the university sermon in Cambridge in 1784 he denounced the slave trade as a &#145;sin against the light of nature, and the accumulated evidence of divine Revelation&#146;  (Peckard, <span class="italic">Piety</span>, 6). As vice-chancellor in 1785 he set the legitimacy of slavery as the theme of the senior bachelors' Latin essay prize: it was won by Thomas Clarkson, who was thus set on his abolitionist career. Peckard's pamphlet demolishing notions of African inferiority, <span class="italic">Am I not a Man and a Brother?</span> (1788), may have launched the phrase as an anti-slavery slogan. He was a patron of Olaudah Equiano, the African-born abolitionist.<br>
<br>It was probably during his military service that he became a friend of Sir John Griffin Griffin, later Lord Howard de Walden, whose inheritance of Audley End gave him the right to appoint Peckard as master of Magdalene College. An advanced liberal, Peckard arrived in 1781 to head a college which had become an early haven for evangelicalism in the university. Yet the new master did not clash with the evangelical fellows. He saw eye to eye with them on the slavery issue and like them regarded the college &#145;not as a place of dissipation and expense but of economy and education&#146;  (Forbes, 246). Following the associationist psychology of John Locke and David Hartley, Peckard believed in the malleability of the human personality, and saw education as a vital means of social progress. Under his aegis Magdalene flourished, producing a stream of university prize-winners, missionaries, and evangelical leaders. A firm master, he stabilized the college finances, increased admissions, and maintained discipline. He was a major college benefactor, leaving lands and money to augment stipends and fund two open Ferrar scholarships in memory of his wife's family. Peckard compiled <span class="italic">Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar</span> (1790).<br>
<br>In 1792 came Peckard's advancement to the deanery of Peterborough. His chapter grumbled at his refusal to provide them more than one annual dinner. In 1795, when old and infirm, he managed to deliver a sombre fast sermon in the cathedral, demanding peace with France and warning that the continuance of the slave trade would amplify God's present judgements on the nation. He died of cancer on 8 December 1797, having imprudently cut off a facial wen which hampered his shaving. He was buried in Peterborough Cathedral.<br>
