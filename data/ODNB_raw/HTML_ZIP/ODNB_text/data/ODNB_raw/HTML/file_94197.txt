<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hampshire, Sir  Stuart Newton</span>  (1914&#150;2004), <span class="occ">philosopher and college head</span>, was born on 1 October 1914 at Arden Court, Healing, Lincolnshire, the son of George Newton Hampshire, who ran a fish merchant's business in nearby Grimsby, and his wife, Marie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> West. He was educated at Repton School. In 1933 he gained a scholarship in modern history to Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford, however, he switched to Greats (philosophy and ancient history), graduated with a first in 1936, and was elected to an All Souls fellowship that autumn. On arrival at All Souls he became a member of the philosophical group that Isaiah Berlin and J. L. Austin had just established. Of their meetings Berlin said that &#145;in retrospect they seem to me to be the most fruitful discussions of philosophy at which I was ever present&#146;  (Berlin, 108). Berlin later deplored their lack of interest in the wider philosophical world, but the habit of attending carefully to what was being said at the moment and by the particular persons in the room was a valuable one, and Hampshire's attentiveness to his students in later life was much admired by his colleagues.<br>
<br>In 1937 Hampshire began a long relationship with (Grace Isabel) Ren&eacute;e Ayer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lees (1909&#150;1980), the wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39796/', "A. J. (Freddie) Ayer")</script>. For a decade after 1937 the attachment threatened to destroy Hampshire's chances of an established career, whether in academic life or in the Foreign Office. The person apparently least put out by it was Ayer himself; he finally divorced Ren&eacute;e in 1941, citing Hampshire as co-respondent, but always acknowledged the child born to his friend and his wife in 1939 as his own. Julian Ayer was inevitably known as Julian Ayrshire. Julian's younger sister, Belinda, was acknowledged as Hampshire's child from the first. Hampshire and Ren&eacute;e Ayer eventually married in 1961.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War Hampshire joined the army and served briefly in the infantry in Sierra Leone. He was rapidly transferred into military intelligence, and worked with some distinguished colleagues including Hugh Trevor-Roper. He spent much of the war analysing the activities of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, the central command of Himmler's SS. Like almost everyone else in military intelligence he came across colleagues whose loyalty lay with the Soviet Union rather than their own country. At the end of the war he was interviewed at length about his ties to Guy Burgess, during the first of several failed attempts by MI5 to uncover the full extent of the spy ring that Burgess had established. Many years later Goronwy Rees accused Hampshire of having been a member of the ring that included Burgess, Blunt, and Maclean; he was duly investigated, by Peter Wright, and cleared. The affair was awkward because Hampshire had been appointed in 1962&#150;3 to review the intelligence-gathering activities of GCHQ at Cheltenham.<br>
<br>By the end of the war Hampshire was fully acquainted with the atrocious history of the SS in occupied Europe and Russia. It persuaded him, as he later wrote, that &#145;unmitigated evil and nastiness&#146; are as natural to human beings as kindness  (<span class="italic">Innocence and Experience</span>, 8); the feeling was sharpened when he had to interrogate Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the successor to Heydrich as head of the SS. Even his fellow SS officers regarded Kaltenbrunner as a ruthless sadist whose cruelty was disgusting. He was executed for a long list of war crimes in 1946. When the war was over Hampshire's future was uncertain. There were no philosophy posts open, and a permanent post in the Foreign Office was impossible in view of his marital status; for two years he occupied several slightly obscure positions in the Foreign Office that must sometimes have been a cover for work for MI5. They took him to San Francisco for the opening session of the United Nations and to Paris for some hard work on setting up the Marshall plan.<br>
<br>Hampshire's return to academic life was brought about by Ayer. Ayer left Oxford when he became Grote professor at University College, London, in 1947; he immediately appointed Hampshire to a lecturership in his new department. In 1950 Hampshire left London and became fellow and tutor in philosophy at New College, Oxford; in 1955 he was elected to a senior research fellowship at All Souls; in 1960 Ayer left London when he became Wykeham professor of logic at Oxford, and Hampshire succeeded him as Grote professor. By this time Hampshire had published the two books for which he is best known, <span class="italic">Spinoza</span> in 1951 and <span class="italic">Thought and Action</span> in 1959. In 1960 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. But America beckoned. He stayed at University College, London, for only three years before moving to Princeton, where he was professor of philosophy from 1963 to 1970.<br>
<br>At this time Princeton had one of the best philosophy departments in the world, and it remained so during Hampshire's years there. He became chairman of the department the year after he arrived, and was very successful in the position. His years at Princeton coincided with the increasing hostility to the Vietnam War, and by extension to modern capitalism and its political manifestations, that convulsed American campuses in the 1960s. He played an important role in defusing conflicts at Princeton that could all too easily have led to real bloodshed, as almost happened when students attempted to close the Institute for Defense Analysis and armed police confronted them. Hampshire played down the whole business, and self-deprecatingly referred to himself as having joined &#145;the stage army of the good&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 16 June 2004), whose house journal was the <span class="italic">New York Review of Books</span>, or&#151;as George Will had it&#151;the <span class="italic">English Review of Vietnam</span>. He enjoyed Princeton even though he found its pastiche Gothic painful; but he had no difficulty deciding to return to Oxford as warden of Wadham College when the chance came.<br>
<br>In 1970 Maurice Bowra retired from the position as warden of Wadham that he had occupied since 1938. The college had flourished, and although Bowra was a markedly twenties-ish figure, Wadham was the most left-leaning, radical, and &#145;modern&#146; of the traditional colleges. The college was not of one mind about how different it wished the next warden to be. Wardens had always been chosen from among fellows and former fellows; and Hampshire was not one. What clinched things for Hampshire was the fact that he was unequivocally in favour of Wadham admitting women undergraduates; in the eyes of young fellows it was a litmus test of one's attitude to all aspects of university and college life.<br>
<br>Hampshire was a successful warden, although he did not set out to stamp his personality on the college and the university as Bowra had done. Colleagues and students felt pleased to have in their midst someone who was such a distinguished cultural figure in the wider world. In 1979 Hampshire was knighted for services to philosophy. The following year Ren&eacute;e died. Initially Hampshire withdrew into himself, but then turned more often to colleagues and the college for companionship; students from the early 1980s remembered him with particular affection.<br>
<br>In 1984 Hampshire reached the age of seventy and had to retire from the wardenship. He was appointed to a chair in philosophy at Stanford University. In 1985 he married Nancy Lynn Delaney Cartwright (<i>b</i>. 1944), who was also a professor of philosophy at Stanford; they immediately adopted their first daughter, Emily, and the following year had a daughter of their own, Sophie. Hampshire and his wife remained at Stanford until 1991, when he retired and she became professor of philosophy and scientific method at the London School of Economics. They purchased a small house in Headington, Oxford, within a few yards of the Berlins, and Hampshire very happily&#151;though to the alarm of some old friends who disapproved of domesticity on principle&#151;settled into the role of house-husband, while continuing to write on Spinoza and much else until the very end of his life.<br>
<br>At the time of the publication of <span class="italic">Thought and Action</span> Mary Warnock described Hampshire as an &#145;Aristotelian existentialist&#146;  (personal knowledge), an evocative phrase that catches the flavour of his writing, if not the detail. In 1950 Hampshire had published, in the journal <span class="italic">Mind</span>, a devastating review of Gilbert Ryle's <span class="italic">The Concept of Mind</span> that mocked Ryle's attempt to argue that our mental lives were &#145;obvious not occult&#146;, and insisted that the thoughts and desires of all of us were always open to interpretation and re-interpretation, especially by their &#145;owner&#146;. Hampshire always insisted that Aristotle was right on one crucial issue&#151;what &#145;good&#146; means. A great deal of time could have been saved if this had been better understood. This was a rebuke to those who had proffered emotivist and imperativist analyses of &#145;good&#146;. While Hampshire sided with Aristotle's view that the task of ethics was&#151;in large part&#151;to explicate the nature of the virtues, he was far from endorsing Aristotle's substantive views, and over the years distanced himself still further.<br>
<br>Hampshire's criticisms of Aristotle's vision of the good life emphasized the narrowness of Aristotle's view of what good lives there could be, and the inability of reason to choose between them. Characteristically he went beyond those observations to argue that what most undermined Aristotle's ethics was the nature of the modern world; a new sense of time and a new conception of freedom could not be accommodated within Aristotle's metaphysics and theory of action. He argued much the same case against Spinoza; on the one hand, he admired Spinoza's assaults on irrational guilt and anxiety, but on the other he thought Spinoza's defence of a paternalistic political order was wholly inapt for the modern world.<br>
<br>The implausibility of building politics around the search for harmony became a prominent theme of Hampshire's later thoughts on ethics and politics. In both <span class="italic">Innocence and Experience</span> (1989) and <span class="italic">Justice is Conflict</span> (1999) he pursued ideas that if they had been explained less deftly might have seemed simply nihilistic. One was an emphasis on the difference between private and public virtue. It was intended as a restatement of Machiavelli's insistence on the unavoidability of dirty hands in public life, but Hampshire displayed a much stronger sense of the costs of effectiveness in the public realm, and had none of Machiavelli's relish for dirty tricks as an art form. Nor was Hampshire brusque in the way Machiavelli had been about the relative attractions of different kinds of life; the virtues of innocence were not &#145;monkish&#146;, or suited only to those without the nerve to risk their necks in the political realm.<br>
<br>Hampshire was, among other things, a reviewer of near-genius. Everyone who read him in <span class="italic">Encounter</span> or the <span class="italic">New York Review</span>&#151;perhaps above all, everyone who read him in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>&#151;was enchanted by his reviews; he had an uncanny ability to depict the inner workings of an author's mind and to hold in balance an attention to the deeply individual features of a writer and the culture in which they worked, and the universal features of human life that an author illuminated. He discounted these essays as contributions to criticism properly speaking; this was not affectation but the reflection of a sense of the different tasks proper to the critic and the philosopher. The critic ought, on this view, to tackle single works, one at a time, and evaluate them by the standards of the genre and the aspirations of those who worked in that genre. Hampshire, on the other hand, was showing philosophically minded readers how to nourish their imagination, and uncovering for the benefit of anyone interested the intellectual and theoretical allegiances that animated modern literature. But his sense of how much philosophy could learn from both science and literature had much to do with the engrossing quality of his work. He was a writer to whom readers turned in the expectation of enlightenment and inspiration; they might not always be sure where he would take them, but they were always happy to have shared the journey with him.<br>
<br>Stuart Hampshire was one of the most interesting philosophers of the second half of the twentieth century. He made a less visible impact than several contemporaries: he was less of a public figure than Isaiah Berlin, less of a celebrity than A. J. Ayer, and less influential in setting the philosophical agenda of the day than John Austin, Peter Strawson, or Donald Davidson. But he had a strikingly wide range of close friends in the worlds of literature, art, and politics, and his philosophical writing reflected those interests. His work on Spinoza drew on his interest in psychoanalytic theory, as did his major work, <span class="italic">Thought and Action</span>; while his later political writings, such as <span class="italic">Justice is Conflict</span>, reflected his deep conviction that the task of philosophy was to reflect the reality of irresolvable conflict over ultimate ends, not to try to tidy conflict out of sight. He died of cancer of the pancreas at his home, 7 Beaumont Road, Headington, Oxford, on 13 June 2004, after a mercifully short illness. He was survived by his second wife, Nancy, and his four children.<br>
