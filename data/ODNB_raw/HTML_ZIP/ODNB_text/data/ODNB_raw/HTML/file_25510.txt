<span class="headword">Sibthorp,  Richard Waldo</span>  (1792&#150;1879), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Roman Catholic convert</span>, born at Canwick Hall, near Lincoln, on 4 October 1792, was the fifth and youngest son of Colonel Humphry Waldo Sibthorp (1744&#150;1815), MP for Lincoln, and his wife, Susannah, daughter of Richard Ellison of Sudbrooke Holme, Lincolnshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25507/', "Colonel Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp")</script> was his brother. After an elementary education in a private school at Eltham, Kent, he was sent to Westminster School on 25 March 1807. He matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 12 December 1809, and in 1810 was elected to a demyship at Magdalen College.<br>
<br>Attracted by the Roman Catholic faith, in the Michaelmas term of 1811 Sibthorp went to Wolverhampton, where he spent two days with Bishop John Milner, with the intention of entering the Roman communion. He was brought back, under police surveillance and chancery order, by an elder brother. He graduated BA in 1813, took Anglican orders in 1815, and was appointed curate of Waddington and Harmston, Lincolnshire. There he &#145;preached with all the enthusiasm of a Whitefield&#146;  (Palmer, 22). He graduated MA in 1816, and afterwards became curate to John Scott (1777&#150;1834), incumbent of St Mary's Church, Hull. In July 1819 he was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and in the same year became vicar of Tattersall, Lincolnshire. He proceeded BD in 1823. In 1825 he took the charge of Percy proprietary chapel, St Pancras, London, and was subsequently evening lecturer at St John's Chapel, Bedford Row. At this period he was recognized as one of the leaders of the London evangelicals, and he was one of the founder members of the Islington Clerical Society. In 1829 he gave up his connection with London chapels and went to reside at Magdalen College as a fellow. From 1830 to 1841 he was incumbent of St James's Church, Ryde, Isle of Wight.<br>
<br>On resigning the living Sibthorp was received into the Roman Catholic church at St Mary's College, Oscott, on 27 October 1841 by Bishop (afterwards Cardinal) Wiseman. Clerical conversions to Catholicism were at that period rare, and his defection excited considerable alarm. Sibthorp studied divinity at Oscott for a few months, was ordained priest on 21 May 1842, and was then attached to the cathedral church of St Chad, Birmingham, though he subsequently moved into a house which he bought for himself at Edgbaston. Dissatisfied with his position, and mentally disquieted after a serious accident, he left Edgbaston in June 1843 and purchased a cottage near St Helens, Isle of Wight, where he continued to say mass until October. Then he returned to the communion of the established church.<br>
<br>After three years of retirement at Winchester, Sibthorp made a fruitless petition to Bishop Charles Richard Sumner to be reinstated as an Anglican clergyman. After settling at Lincoln in 1847 he established a liberally endowed St Anne's bede-house, and in the same year he was readmitted to discharge the functions of the Anglican ministry. Sibthorp resigned the chaplain-wardenship of St Anne's at the close of 1864, and on 25 January 1865 resumed the privilege of saying mass in the private chapel of Cardinal Wiseman. In December 1865 he was attached to the cathedral of St Barnabas, Nottingham. He frequently preached there, but, &#145;though now a Roman Catholic priest, his feelings, his language, his general teaching, were, in some very important respects, still evangelical&#146;  (Fowler, 177). He was placed on the list of retired priests in December 1874, and died at Nottingham on 10 April 1879. Following a Catholic requiem mass at Nottingham, he was buried in Lincoln cemetery where, in accordance with his express desire, the Anglican service was read over his grave.<br>
<br>Sibthorp was unquestionably devout and sincere (and Gladstone thought him &#145;a holy man&#146;; <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 21 April 1880), but he was never able to satisfy himself that he was in the true church. Certainly he never accepted the full range of Catholic dogma in his Catholic periods. In addition to several sermons and pamphlets, he published <span class="italic">Psalms and Hymns</span> (1831), <span class="italic">The Family Liturgy, being a Course of Morning and Evening Prayers for a Family</span> (1836), and <span class="italic">Daily Bread, being a Few Morning Meditations for the Use of Catholic Christians</span> (1876; rev. and enlarged edn, 1879). His apologetic, <span class="italic">Some Answer to the Inquiry &#145;Why are you become a Catholic?&#146;</span> (1842), elicited a series of replies from Oxford friends, including William Dodsworth and William Palmer, and a further reply from Sibthorp.<br>
