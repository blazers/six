<span class="headword">Adams,  William Grylls</span>  (1836&#150;1915), <span class="occ">scientist and university teacher</span>, was born on 10 February 1836 at Lidcot, Laneast, Cornwall, the youngest son of the four sons and three daughters of Thomas Adams (1788&#150;1859), small estate owner and farmer, and his wife, Tabitha Knill Grylls (1796&#150;1866). The eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/123/', "John Couch Adams (1819&#150;1892)")</script>, was an astronomer and the discoverer of the planet Neptune. Adams was educated at a private school in Birkenhead and then entered St John's College, Cambridge, to study mathematics in 1855, graduating twelfth wrangler in 1859. He received the ScD degree in 1889. He was a fellow of St John's College from 1865 to 1869 and it was at Cambridge that he attended the experimental science lectures of George Stokes.<br>
<br>In 1859 Adams was appointed vice-principal of Peterborough Training College. In the following year he moved to Marlborough College as mathematics master, where he remained until 1863 when he was appointed lecturer in natural philosophy at King's College, London, under James Clerk Maxwell. In 1865 Maxwell moved to Cambridge and Adams, who was said to be a better disciplinarian than Maxwell, replaced the latter as professor of natural philosophy, a post he held until his retirement in 1905. In 1864&#150;5 he also taught at Highgate School. On 24 August 1869 he married Mary Dingle, daughter of Richard Dingle, a farmer, at Lewannick in Cornwall.<br>
<br>While at King's College Adams was in the forefront of the development of science education. Many of the students at King's would enter manufacturing or engineering. With this in mind, Adams introduced a substantial practical element into the physics course with a strong emphasis upon measurement and the application of mechanics to practical engineering situations. Eventually his practical regime was extended to all branches of physics taught there. He was also successful in improving laboratory accommodation at the college and this helped to bring in money partly via the Whitworth scholarship scheme. While in London he attended John Tyndall's lectures at the Royal Institution and he was a member of a committee intended to increase college autonomy over teaching and examining.<br>
<br>Adams undertook a number of educational roles outside King's College. He was an examiner in physics for the Department of Science and Art from 1879 until 1892 and for the universities of London and Cambridge. He played an active role in the formation of the Physical Society in 1874 and was its president from 1878 until 1880. In 1880 he was president of Section A of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and gave an address to the association's annual meeting outlining recent developments in physics. He was a member of its council in 1878&#150;83. In 1884 Adams was president of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians (later to become the Institution of Electrical Engineers). He gave a presidential address in which he outlined some measurements made on the efficiency of dynamos used at an electrical exhibition at the Crystal Palace in 1882. This was a period of very rapid growth in the technology of electrical power generation and transmission and Adams was at the vanguard of this new technology.<br>
<br>Adams had a variety of research interests of which one was magnetism. He studied the change in resistance produced by magnetization in iron and steel (1875). He compared magnetograph curves recorded at the observatories of Kew, Stonyhurst, Lisbon, Coimbra, Vienna, and St Petersburg (1880), and examined magnetic disturbances produced simultaneously at a number of locations (1893). He studied the polarization of light (1871), and in the late 1870s developed new forms of the polariscope, an instrument for studying the polarization of light. His particular instrument was used for determining the optical axes of biaxial crystals. In addition he studied the action of light on selenium (1875, 1877) and on selenium and tellurium (1876). Adams also determined lines of flow curves and equipotential surfaces in both two- and three-dimensional objects. This was the subject of his Bakerian lecture to the Royal Society in 1875. He had been elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1872 and was a member of the Kew observatory committee of the society as well as being on the board of visitors of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. His interest in astronomy took him to Sicily in 1871 to study eclipses. He was a much travelled man and in his earlier years he had been a proficient mountaineer and a member of an alpine mountaineering club.<br>
<br>Adams had a great interest in lighthouse illumination and in 1885 he conducted work for Trinity House on a comparison of oil and electric lights for this purpose. In 1883 he gave a series of public lectures (the Cantor lectures) on electrical lighting. He edited two sets of volumes of the scientific papers of his brother John in 1896 and 1901. Those who knew Adams spoke of him as a very approachable colleague and teacher, and a man of great geniality. He retired from King's College, London, in 1905. A year later he went to live at Heathfield in Broadstone, Dorset, where he died on 10 April 1915. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter.<br>
