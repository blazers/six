<span class="headword">Larkin,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1580&#150;1619), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, is first recorded on 17 July 1606 when he was awarded the freedom of the City of London by redemption in the Company of Painter&#150;Stainers. Further documentary evidence of his life and work is scanty, but because his will is listed with those in the parish of St Sepulchre, just outside the walls of the City, it has been suggested that his father may have been William Larkin, the host of The Rose inn in that parish. A brother, Richard, and his son, Benjamin, are mentioned in the will.<br>
<br>The fact that Larkin did not obtain his freedom to trade in London in the usual way&#151;by patrimony or after serving an apprenticeship&#151;is unexplained. Freedom by redemption was usually awarded to craftsmen coming from elsewhere, but the evidence of Larkin's painting style points to training in one of the London studios. In any event by 1606 he had certainly attracted patronage at the highest level: his sponsors for freedom of the City were Lady Arabella Stuart, third in line to the throne, and her future father-in-law, Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford.<br>
<br>In 1609 or 1610 Larkin painted the only picture which can as yet be linked to documentary evidence: a portrait of Edward Herbert, first Baron Herbert of Cherbury, which survives with its pair, of Sir Thomas Lucy (1585&#150;1640; Charlecote Park, Warwickshire). According to an anecdote told in Herbert's autobiography, copies of the portrait were made for the queen, for Richard Sackville, the third earl of Dorset, and in miniature by Isaac Oliver, for Lady Aeres (a copy at University College, Oxford, may be one of these). In 1613 Larkin painted the third earl of Dorset and his brother, Sir Edward Sackville, later fourth earl, and shortly afterwards he or his studio was responsible for seven portraits of ladies connected with the Suffolk family. (This series is now in the collection of English Heritage.) The Rutland papers record two payments to Larkin, both of the considerable sum of &pound;30: in 1617 for an unspecified picture, and in 1619 for a portrait of Lady Katherine Manners, who was to marry George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham, in the following year (a portrait of Buckingham in the National Portrait Gallery, London, is attributed to Larkin on stylistic and technical grounds). In the summer of 1618 Lady Anne Clifford sat to Larkin (a bust-length portrait still at Knole, Kent, may be a copy of the original). Three portraits by Larkin are listed in a seventeenth-century inventory of pictures at Claydon House, Buckinghamshire: Lady Sussex; Frances Howard, countess of Somerset; and Anne Turner, her accomplice in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury.<br>
<br>Larkin represents the end of the tradition in which a painter was regarded as an anonymous craftsman, like a possible relation, Thomas Larkin, the king's locksmith. His paintings echo the elaborate concoctions of late sixteenth-century European court portraiture, a style soon to be swept away by the tide of the baroque brought to England from Flanders by Rubens and Anthony Van Dyck.<br>
<br>All that is known of Larkin's domestic life derives from the parish registers of St Ann Blackfriars, where between 1612 and 1615 the baptisms and burials of three of his children are recorded, and from his will, in which he mentioned his wife and young daughter, both named Mary. There is no suggestion of worldly success, although the sums paid for his work compared well with those paid to his contemporaries, and his estate is referred to simply as &#145;goods and chattels and debts&#146;. Larkin died in 1619, between 10 April when he signed his will and 14 May when it was proved.<br>
