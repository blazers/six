<span class="headword">Stevenson,  Robert Alan Mowbray</span>  (1847&#150;1900), <span class="occ">painter and art critic</span>, the only son of the Scottish engineer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26427/', "Alan Stevenson (1807&#150;1865)")</script> and his wife, Margaret Scott Jones (1813&#150;1895), was born at Edinburgh on 25 March 1847; his younger sister, Katharine [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60256/', "Mattos, Katharine Elizabeth Alan de")</script>], later achieved prominence as a writer. From boyhood he was a close friend of his first cousin Robert Louis Stevenson, his junior by three and a half years, who was to acknowledge his youthful debt to the stimulating company and influence of his cousin Bob. Robert Stevenson was educated at Windermere College and at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he took no honours, but graduated BA in 1871 and MA in 1882. He excelled as a gymnast and athlete; his favourite outdoor exercise was canoeing. His bohemian temperament made the family profession unattractive to him; his real interests lay in the fine arts, especially their theory and practice.<br>
<br>For a year or two after taking his degree Stevenson continued to live with his widowed mother and sisters at Edinburgh, studying painting at the school of art in that city. In 1873 he went to Antwerp to continue his studies at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts before moving to Paris to study with Carolus Duran, and then spending several years at Barbizon and Grez. In 1876, with his cousin, he took the canoe trip on the Sambre, Meuse, and Somme which is the subject of R. L. Stevenson's book <span class="italic">Inland Voyage</span> (1878).<br>
<br>Stevenson's work in landscape painting, exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere, was interesting and competent; but his unassertive personality and lack of commercial instinct would probably have hampered his career as an artist. Theory was his element, and about 1881&#151;the year in which he married Harriett Louisa (<i>b</i>. 1855/6), daughter of Theodore Purland, on 27 August&#151;his friends, especially W. E. Henley, began to urge him to turn his critical faculties to practical account. In 1882 he taught a painting class of undergraduates at Cambridge, in connection with the work of Sidney Colvin as Slade professor. Having previously been an occasional contributor, from 1885 to 1889 he wrote regularly for the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> as a critic of both painting and music. In 1889 he was appointed professor of fine arts at University College, Liverpool, and, after resigning that office in 1893, became for six years the regular art critic of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. He was also a contributor to the <span class="italic">Magazine of Art</span> and to the <span class="roman">Portfolio Monographs</span>.<br>
<br>Stevenson also published a translation of Henri Delaborde's <span class="italic">La gravure</span> as <span class="italic">Engraving</span> (1886), a short study of Peter Paul Rubens (1898), and his most important work, <span class="italic">Velasquez</span> (1895, revised and expanded 1899; new edition by Denys Sutton, 1962). This volume was closely linked, both in Stevenson's terms and the values he stressed, to his long-standing championship of both Whistler and the impressionists: he sought legitimacy and acceptance for these contemporary artists by drawing attention to the parallels that could be made between their techniques and those of Vel&aacute;zquez, &#145;the great Spanish Impressionist&#146;  (R. A. M. Stevenson, <span class="italic">Velasquez</span>, 1895). An essay on Raeburn, accompanying a volume of reproductions from that master's works, was published posthumously (1900).<br>
<br>Stevenson was the pioneer of a new school of art criticism in England. He attempted, above all, to introduce the British public to the aims and methods of impressionism, valuing these painters' capacity to reproduce &#145;the broad shimmer of light and the aerial suppleness of a natural envelopement&#146;  (&#145;The Royal Academy: IV&#146;, <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 63, 4 June 1887, 800). Although he was scrupulously fair towards other artistic tendencies with which he was less in sympathy, he was critical of the policies of the Royal Academy, believing them to be over-influenced by commercial considerations and to favour those artists who fed public taste with &#145;nice little fables with a very obvious moral&#146;  (&#145;The Picture Galleries: III&#146;, <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 55, 19 May 1883, 632). He attacked those artists who practised &#145;the realism of story telling and illustrative incident, instead of the realism of effect&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 65, 19 May 1888, 595).<br>
<br>Stevenson's prose was lucid and vivid. Yet he had learned to write with difficulty, and his instinctive genius was for talk. In conversation his insight, imagination, humour, and gift of expression played freely, and not only on artistic topics. R. A. M. Stevenson aptly figures in the writings of his cousin R. L. S. as the Arethusa of the <span class="italic">Inland Voyage</span>, and Spring-heel'd Jack of the essay <span class="italic">Talk and Talkers</span>. In the autumn of 1899 Stevenson's health broke down, and he died of heart disease in his house at 41 Oxford Road, Chiswick, on 18 April 1900.<br>
