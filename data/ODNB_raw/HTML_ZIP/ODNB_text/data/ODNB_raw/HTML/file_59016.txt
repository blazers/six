<span class="headword">Merrifield <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Watkins]</span>,  Mary Philadelphia</span>  (1804&#150;1889), <span class="occ">writer on art and algologist</span>, was born on 15 April 1804 in Brompton, London, the daughter of a conveyancing barrister, Sir Charles Watkins. In 1827 she married John Merrifield of Tavistock (1788/9&#150;1877), who was called to the bar in Middle Temple in 1828 and practised for many years in Brighton, where the family lived. Her earliest work appears to be her translation, entitled <span class="italic">Treatise of Painting</span> (1844), of Cennino Cennici's early fifteenth-century work, which had been recently discovered and published in 1821 by the Italian antiquary Giuseppe Tambroni. This led to her employment by the royal commission on the fine arts, investigating the history of painters' materials and techniques, which resulted in the publication of her <span class="italic">The Art of Fresco Painting</span> (1846). Reflecting the royal commission's deep concern about the absence of a British school of history painting, it was at once a collection of historical texts on the techniques of twelfth- to eighteenth-century fresco painters and a manual for the practising artist; it long remained a useful work and was reprinted in 1952. Her two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18603/', "Charles Watkins Merrifield (1827&#150;1884)")</script>, later a marine engineer and mathematician, and Frederick Merrifield, assisted her researches. Mrs Merrifield followed this important work with <span class="italic">Original Treatises on the Arts of Painting</span> (1849), a collection of early technical information which remained of value for many years and was reprinted in 1967.<br>
<br>In 1851 Mary Merrifield published <span class="italic">Practical Directions for Portrait-Painting in Watercolours</span>, which was followed in 1854 by <span class="italic">Dress as a Fine Art</span>, a reprint of essays which had first appeared in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> and the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>; both works seem to be intended for a readership of young middle-class women. In <span class="italic">Dress</span> Mrs Merrifield declared herself in favour of practical, modest, and elegant fashions, and displayed a considerable sympathy for the dress reforms of Amelia Bloomer. Her <span class="italic">Handbook of Light and Shade with Reference to Model Drawing</span> (1855) was possibly written at the request of her son Charles, who was then an examiner in the education office.<br>
<br>On 2 May 1857 Mary Merrifield was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100 in recognition of her services to literature and art. Ironically her literary career now took a new direction: in the same year she published <span class="italic">Brighton Past and Present</span>, a lively guidebook featuring a good many Regency anecdotes, which was followed by <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Natural History of Brighton</span> (1864). This reflected her new interest in botany: over the next twenty years, taking advantage of her seaside residency, she became an accepted authority on seaweeds, publishing articles on marine algae in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Linnean Society</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span>, and the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span>. From 1875 until her death she also contributed frequently to the important scientific journal <span class="italic">Nature</span>, exhibiting a keen sensitivity to both the beauty and the antiquity of her subject matter. She assisted in the arrangement and display of natural history exhibits at the Brighton Museum, and in her later years learned Danish and Swedish to read scientific literature in these languages. A species of marine algae was named after her, and her herbarium is held at the natural history department of the British Museum.<br>
<br>After the death of her husband in 1877 Mary Merrifield went to live with her daughter, who had married a clergyman, at Stapleford vicarage, near Cambridge; she died there on 4 January 1889. Her contributions to both art history and science show how a linguistically accomplished middle-class woman could establish herself in Victorian cultural and scholarly circles: C. R. Sherman has emphasized how translations&#151;rather than original writings&#151;could serve as &#145;passports for women's publications in the arts&#146;  (Sherman, 13), while the essentially taxonomic and descriptive project of late Victorian botany offered Merrifield an opportunity to establish a niche in one of the few sciences considered suitable for her sex.<br>
