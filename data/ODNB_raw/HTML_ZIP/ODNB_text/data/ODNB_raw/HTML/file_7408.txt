<span class="headword">Decker, Sir  Matthew</span>, first baronet  (1679&#150;1749), <span class="occ">political economist and merchant</span>, was born in Amsterdam, the son of Derrick (Dirk) Decker, of Amsterdam, and his wife, Katherina. He received his commercial education under Burgomaster Velters of Amsterdam, but in 1702 travelled to London to establish himself as a merchant, and was naturalized in February 1704, at the second attempt. He then consolidated his business interests, and it was through trader and banker John Drummond that he secured a match on 16 August 1710 with Henrietta (1679&#150;1759), daughter of Richard Watkins DD, rector of Whichford, Warwickshire, a union which produced two sons and four daughters. His daughters are the subject of a group portrait (1718) by the Dutch artist Jan van Meyer which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. Decker's eldest daughter, Catherine (<i>c</i>.1710&#150;1786), married Richard Fitzwilliam, sixth Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion, and was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9660/', "Richard Fitzwilliam, seventh Viscount Fitzwilliam")</script>, whose art and manuscript collections&#151;including works inherited from his maternal grandfather&#151;formed the basis of the Fitzwilliam Museum.<br>
<br>By the time of his marriage Decker had already become a leading figure in Anglo-Dutch commerce, but the change of ministry in the summer of 1710 proved the making of his career, for he quickly established himself as one of Robert Harley's trusted City agents. As early as August 1710 he was ready to loan the government &pound;40,000 to bolster its credit, and during the last three years of the War of the Spanish Succession he advanced several large remittances to keep the forces in the Low Countries supplied. He was also one of the leading backers for Harley's South Sea Company, subscribing for &pound;49,271 worth of stock, and was appointed as one of its original directors. However, he withdrew from the board the following year, and thereafter sought prominence in the East India Company, where he served as a director from 1713 to 1743, as deputy governor in 1720&#150;21 and 1729&#150;30, and as governor in 1725&#150;6 and 1730&#150;33.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1713 Decker was a powerful figure in the City, using his position to advance relations between his native and adopted countries. It was even said that he would &#145;become a very rich man without risking what he has already got, which is a happiness that few can arrive to&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.330). Such good fortune was less apparent the following year, when his patron Harley was dismissed from office, and he found himself &#145;extremely&#146; pressed for lack of money  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.497). Although he was never to achieve as close a connection with any Hanoverian ministry, his influence was recognized on 20 July 1716, when he was raised to the dignity of baronet. Three years later he entered parliament as member for Bishops Castle, thanks to the interest of James Brydges, duke of Chandos, a former paymaster of the forces, with whom he had had many financial dealings. In common with the rest of the City, Decker faced great difficulty at the time of the South Sea Bubble, and rumours circulated that he faced bankruptcy. However, his friends moved quickly to quash these reports, observing that he &#145;had sold out betimes, and had left nothing in any of the stocks but what was pure gains&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 7.282). Decker himself was bullish at this critical moment, writing to assure his Dutch banker Andreas Pels that he could &#145;draw at sight &pound;100,000 on him&#146;  (ibid.). However, despite his importance in the City and as a former director of the South Sea Company, Decker did not play a prominent parliamentary role in the wake of the bubble, when the regulation of the City was of great national interest, and he declined to seek re-election in 1722.<br>
<br>Although a City magnate, Decker did not covet advancement within the London corporation, and away from East India business his consuming passion was his estate at Richmond, where he entertained George I in 1716. As if to demonstrate his attachment to country life, he was prepared to undertake the onerous position of sheriff of Surrey in 1729&#150;30. He appears to have taken especial care in developing his gardens, and was credited by contemporaries as the first to grow the pineapple in England, although this claim was later refuted. His commercial activities brought other exotic curiosities to Richmond, including a Chinese cock pheasant.<br>
<br>Decker had far from retired from commerce, however, and his principal fame rests with two anonymous treatises of the 1740s which have been attributed to him. The first, <span class="italic">Serious considerations on the several high duties which the nation in general, as well as trade in particular, labour under, with a proposal for preventing the removing of goods, discharging the trader from any search, and raising all the public supplies by one single tax</span>, appeared in 1743, and went through seven editions by 1756, the last of which named Decker as author. Joseph Massie's pamphlet of 1757, which attacked <span class="italic">The Proposal, Commonly called Sir Matthew Decker's Scheme for one General Tax upon Houses</span>, also pointed to Decker's involvement, but historians have remained sceptical about such claims. The second work, <span class="italic">An essay on the causes of the decline of the foreign trade, consequently of the value of Britain, and on the means to restore both</span>, was published in 1744, although &#145;begun in 1739&#146;, and was translated into French by Abb&eacute; de Gua de Malves in 1757. Josiah Tucker identified it as Decker's in 1751  (<span class="italic">Townshend MSS</span>, 376&#150;7), but another contemporary, Francis Fauquier, thought it the work of William Richardson  (McCulloch). Such arguments have continued ever since, although it is generally accepted that the <span class="italic">Essay</span> is Decker's. The principal difficulty in identifying him as the author of both tracts is the irreconcilability of the tax proposals which appear in these writings, with the <span class="italic">Considerations</span> calling for a single duty on houses, while the <span class="italic">Essay</span> supports an imposition on luxury consumers. However, there are important similarities between the two works, most notably a proposal for licensing tea consumers.<br>
<br>The treatises attracted considerable comment, particularly for their bold advocacy of free trade and the introduction of an all-embracing single tax. Indeed, the <span class="italic">Considerations</span> was &#145;strongly recommended to the electors of Great Britain, that they should, preferably to place and pension bills, or even triennial Parliaments, press their representatives to pass an Act pursuant to the author's scheme&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 13.653&#150;5). Both schemes held the plethora of existing customs and excise duties currently as an obstacle to the advancement of trade, an attack meeting the approval of economists such as Fauquier and Malacy Postlethwayt. Equally popular was the expressed concern to alleviate the burden of taxation on the lower orders, and to shift taxes from the merchant to the consumer. Other observers, most notably Joseph Massie, Arthur Young, and Adam Smith, were less convinced by the workability of the schemes, and even the <span class="italic">Considerations</span> conceded that some prohibitive duties might be needed to regulate trade to protect domestic manufacturers. Such radical proposals had little hope of immediate parliamentary sanction, for eighteenth-century governments remained too timorous to tamper with the customs system in favour of direct taxation.<br>
<br>Decker was still eager to serve the government in June 1747, writing to the duke of Newcastle to enquire whether he could fulfil any services on a forthcoming trip to the Netherlands, or as he still termed it, &#145;the old fatherland&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32711, fol. 557). However, it was in his adopted country that he died on 18 March 1749, and his body was laid to rest at St Mary Magdalene's Church, Richmond. Estimated by one source to be worth &#145;upwards of &pound;100,000&#146; at his death, Decker bequeathed his considerable estate to his three surviving daughters  (<span class="italic">London Magazine</span>). His will urged a charitable disposition upon his heirs, for he declared that &#145;I never have felt so much inward joy as when I gave money or other things in charity, especial[ly] when I was satisfied that it was disposed upon honest, good and industrious Christians&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/769, sig. 103). By the testimony of one obituarist, this was no rhetoric, for he had &#145;a remarkable evenness of temper, and an uninterrupted tranquillity of mind, &hellip; the proofs and rewards of such conscious virtue&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 19.141).<br>
