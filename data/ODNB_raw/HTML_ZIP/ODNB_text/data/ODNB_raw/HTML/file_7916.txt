<span class="headword">Douglas,  Robert</span>  (1594&#150;1674), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was the son of George Douglas, in turn the illegitimate son of Sir George Douglas of Lochleven and, according to commonly held contemporary opinion, of Mary, queen of Scots. However, while Robert never denied the rumour of his royal heritage, there is no historical evidence to substantiate it. Little is known of his early life other than that he was educated at the University of St Andrews and that he graduated MA in 1614. Licensed to preach the gospel about 1617, he was ordained to the second charge of Kirkcaldy in 1628 and, soon after, became chaplain to one of the brigades of Scottish auxiliaries sent to aid Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War. By all reports Douglas was a man of majestic appearance, great wit, and strength of character which, combined with the rumours of his parentage, caused many of his contemporaries to stand in awe of him. According to the historian Robert Wodrow, Gustavus was so impressed with him that upon Douglas's departure he declared, &#145;There is a man who, for wisdom and prudence, might be a counsellour to any king in Europe&#146;  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Analecta</span>, 3.82).<br>
<br>In 1638 Douglas subscribed the national covenant and was a member of the famous Glasgow general assembly that abjured episcopacy. The following year he was translated to the second charge of St Giles, Edinburgh, and on 24 December 1641 he was removed to the city's north-west quarter, or Tolbooth parish. He was elected moderator of the 1642 general assembly and at its close was chosen moderator of the assembly's revived standing committee, the powerful commission for the public affairs of the kirk. The next year he was named as one of the Scottish commissioners to the assembly of divines at Westminster, but did not serve because of other responsibilities. From January to November 1644 he served as moderator of the presbytery of the Scottish army and as chaplain to the earl of Leven during the army's expedition into England. By the summer of 1646 Douglas's first wife, Margaret Kirkaldy, whom he had married at an unknown date, had died, and on 20 August 1646 he married Margaret Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1692).<br>
<br>During the remainder of the decade Douglas emerged as the kirk's leading minister. He was elected moderator of the general assembly three more times, in 1645, 1647, and 1649, and served as moderator of its commission from 1646 to 1650. During the period known as the theocracy, or kirk regime, following the duke of Hamilton's failed engagement, his sphere of power was greatly expanded as the assembly and its commission exercised an unprecedented influence on the affairs of state. Accordingly, in early 1649 he was translated again to Edinburgh's High Kirk, this time to the prestigious first charge, where he remained until the Restoration.<br>
<br>In February 1650 Douglas joined with the marquess of Argyll and other leading moderates in kirk and state in calling for renewed negotiations with the exiled Charles II. During the ensuing controversy between the regime's radical and moderate wings he led the moderates in a staunch defence of the king's royal prerogatives. Following the Cromwellian invasion of Scotland in the summer of 1650 he resisted the radicals' desire to purge all royalist malignants and former engagers from the covenanting army, and instead advocated the raising of all fencible men in the nation's defence. From December 1650 to May 1651 he led the commission in passing a number of public resolutions which resulted in parliament's full repeal of the 1646 and 1649 acts of classes and the readmittance of royalists and engagers to the military and public office. On 1 January 1651 he officiated at the coronation of Charles II at Scone, and preached a sermon in which he reminded the king of his covenanted responsibility to establish presbyterianism in all three of his kingdoms. In July he was elected moderator of the infamous &#145;pretended&#146; general assembly at St Andrews and Dundee, which ratified the commission's public resolutions, and saw the kirk irreparably divided between resolutioners and protesters.<br>
<br>On 28 August 1651 Douglas and other leading members of the commission and committee of estates were captured at Alyth, near Dundee, by a large troop of English horse. He was transported to England and imprisoned in the Tower of London. During his confinement Douglas continued to have a large influence on the affairs of the national kirk, even going so far as to send his resolutioner colleagues detailed instructions on how to conduct the business of the 1652 general assembly.<br>
<br>In early April 1653 Douglas was released from the Tower and returned to Edinburgh amid much public jubilation. Immediately upon his arrival in the city he began to preach against sectarianism and religious toleration and persuaded the synod of Lothian to emit a protestation &#145;against the usurpation of the English&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, vol. 3, appendix 1, 446). He also encouraged the resolutioner ministers to give covert support to the royalist rebellion in the highlands known as Glencairn's rising. For his suspected complicity in this matter he was identified by the commander of the English army in Scotland, Colonel Robert Lilburne, as &#145;the principall man in their plott&#146;  (Firth, 160). With the failure of the rising he changed tack and, together with his colleagues &#145;the Ministers of Edinburgh&#146;, led the national party in pursuing an accommodation with the English authorities. In September 1655 he and his ministerial colleagues reached an accord with the Lord Broghill and the Scottish council wherein the resolutioners agreed to suspend their public prayers for the king. The following year he was instrumental in the party's decision to grant tacit recognition to the English regime's authority in ecclesiastical matters. During the years 1657 and 1659 he directed the activities of the resolutioners' agent, James Sharp, during his struggles with the protesters in London.<br>
<br>In late 1659 and early 1660 Douglas assisted General Monck, soliciting support for his intervention in England, and using his influence to ensure that Scotland remained calm after the general's march into England. During the remainder of 1660 he also continued to direct Sharp in his ill-fated attempts to secure a presbyterian settlement for the Scottish church. Due to his efforts in effecting the Restoration, in the autumn of 1661 Douglas was offered, via Sharp, a bishopric. Douglas flatly refused, but perceiving Sharp's intention to take the archbishopric of St Andrews, told him, &#145;take it, and the curse of God with it&#146;  (Kilpatrick, 44). Douglas was removed from his charge at St Giles in June 1662 to make way for the new bishop of Edinburgh, and translated to Greyfriars, Edinburgh. On 1 October that year he was deprived from his new charge for refusing to conform to episcopacy. Virtually nothing is known of his activities during the remainder of the 1660s, but in the spring of 1669 Douglas supported the government's plan to settle deposed presbyterian ministers in vacant parishes. He accepted the resultant indulgence and, on 2 September 1669, at the age of seventy-five, was admitted to the parish of Pencaitland in Haddingtonshire, where he continued quietly until his death there in February 1674. He was buried on 6 February at Edinburgh. He was survived by his second wife, Margaret, who died in July 1692.<br>
