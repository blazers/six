<span class="headword">Cooper,  James</span>  (1846&#150;1922), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born at Elgin, Moray, on 13 February 1846, the eldest son of John Alexander Cooper, a merchant, afterwards a farmer at Spynie, Elgin. His mother, Ann, daughter of James Stephen of Old Keith, was descended from the Gordons and Stuarts of Birkenburn. Educated at Elgin Academy and at Aberdeen University (1863&#150;70), where he graduated MA in 1867, Cooper was licensed to preach in 1871. In 1873 he was ordained at St Stephen's Church, Broughty Ferry, and in 1881 was translated to the East Church of St Nicholas, Aberdeen; in 1898 he became regius professor of church history at Glasgow University.<br>
<br>Cooper was an energetic pastor and a faithful preacher. He introduced Holy Week services at St Stephen's, revived the daily service at Aberdeen, and was the first to institute a women's guild. Shortly after his induction to the East Church in Aberdeen his &#145;high church&#146; doctrine and practices were challenged by some of the elders. The final verdict of the presbytery in the &#145;East Church case&#146;, however, represented a vindication of Cooper's position as belonging within the reformed tradition of the kirk. Passionately interested in church architecture and antiquities, he founded the Aberdeen Ecclesiological Society and later served four times as president of the Scottish Ecclesiological Society. He was also an active member of the Church Service Society, for which he produced an edition of &#145;Laud's liturgy&#146; in 1904. He had previously edited the chartulary of the East Church, Aberdeen, for the New Spalding Club (1888&#150;92).<br>
<br>Cooper reflected his upbringing in the episcopalian north-east of Scotland by being a lifelong advocate of the union of the Church of Scotland and the Church of England, a &#145;United Church for the British Empire&#146;. He was the first secretary of the Scottish Church Society, founded in 1892 to advance Catholic doctrine, and he became one of the leaders of the &#145;Scoto-Catholic&#146; party in the kirk. He took a prominent part in the negotiations for presbyterian reunion in Scotland, and secured what he considered to be an adequate safeguard for the Catholic faith in the new constitution of the kirk set out in the &#145;articles declaratory&#146; of 1921. He was elected moderator of the general assembly in 1917, a tribute to the high regard in which he was held in the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>As professor Cooper exercised a strong personal influence over students by his sincerity and piety; his cultured mind, varied interests, and generous hospitality also brought him a large circle of friends. He published a large number of sermons, addresses, and pamphlets, and in 1907 brought out <span class="italic">Confessions of Faith and Formulas of Subscription</span>. On 4 January 1912 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1947), eldest daughter of George Williamson, a farmer at Shempston in Moray; they had no children. He received the freedom of Elgin (1917) and honorary degrees from the universities of Aberdeen (1892), Dublin (1909), Durham (1910), Oxford (1920), and Glasgow (1922). He died at Braemoriston, Elgin, on 27 December 1922, and was buried in Urquhart churchyard on 30 December.<br>
