<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Relph,  Harry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Little Tich]</span>  (1867&#150;1928), <span class="occ">music-hall entertainer</span>, was born on 21 July 1867 at Cudham, Kent, the sixteenth child of Richard Relph (1790&#150;1881), a farmer and publican, and his Irish-born second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Moorefield or Murphew (1835&#150;1893). He was born with an extra finger on each hand and both hands were slightly webbed. He also effectively stopped growing at the age of ten and reached a height of only 4 feet 6 inches. This combination of physical characteristics made him extremely self-conscious and resulted in his seeking privacy when off stage. His stature, however, became essential to his act and to the publicity surrounding it.<br>
<br>When he was ten, Harry Relph began work as a lather-boy in a barber's shop in Gravesend, while at the same time performing as a dancer and tin-whistle player in public-house concerts and free and easies. By 1880 he had developed a &#145;blackface&#146; act and was good enough to secure engagements at the nearby Rosherville Pleasure Gardens and at Barnard's Music Hall, Chatham. He eventually made his London d&eacute;but at the Foresters in 1884. Initially he used the stage name &#145;the Infant Mackney&#146;, an allusion to E. W. Mackney, a leading blackface performer of the period, but by the early 1880s he was billed as &#145;Young Tichborne&#146;. Finally, in late 1884, he adopted the title &#145;Little Titch&#146;, though the &#145;t&#146; soon disappeared. &#145;Tichborne&#146;, or &#145;Tich&#146;, was a childhood nickname, which he, along with many other children of stout build, had to tolerate at this time. It was originally a reference to the corpulence of a celebrated claimant to the Tichborne family inheritance. It was Little Tich's eventual fame that resulted in the name's gaining its current usage, indicating small stature rather than wide girth.<br>
<br>Little Tich's act matured and gained considerable critical acclaim during a tour of the United States between 1887 and 1889. In particular, Tich dropped the blackface act to concentrate on dancing and character sketches. A major success in <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood</span> at Manchester in 1889&#150;90 led to a series of engagements at London halls, notably the Pavilion, and in Drury Lane pantomime. By the early 1890s Tich was a leading figure within British music-hall and comic theatre. Between 1896 and 1902 he ran and performed in his own musical theatre company and also spent much of his time in Paris, where he was an enormously popular variety artist; by 1900 he was a good enough linguist to perform in French, and in 1910 he was made an officer of the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise for his services to French theatre. Although he was no longer at the absolute pinnacle of the variety profession by the early 1920s, he remained a popular performer until his death.<br>
<br>Little Tich was famed above all for his talent as what contemporaries referred to as an &#145;eccentric dancer&#146; and as a character comedian. His most famous routine was the so-called big boot dance, which he developed during his American tour in the 1880s. Each boot was 28 inches in length, and Tich used them as both comic props and the basis for quite remarkable tricks of comic agility. Aided by his being double-jointed, he was able to stand on the points of his shoes and lean out at extraordinary angles. The cry of &#145;Oo'er&#146; when he appeared to stand on his fingers during the dance was a particular trademark. The act was extremely demanding and he tired of it both physically and mentally in his later years, abandoning it from about 1915. In the 1890s he developed a burlesque of the &#145;Serpentine dance&#146; used by the American dancer Loie Fuller, which lead to the invention of Little Miss Turpentine, one of his most successful stock characters. Other richly imagined characters included the Tram Conductor, the Gas Inspector, and the Spanish Senora, all of whose tribulations were acted out in meticulously prepared costumes. It is significant that few of Tich's songs ever gained widespread popular currency. J. B. Priestley, a devotee, noted that they were &#145;sung at a frantic speed, delivered to you as if they were so much routine rubbish, perhaps a minor item in a contract&#146;  (Priestley, 189&#150;90). Tich's forte was his agile and acrobatic dancing and mime, his range of facial expression, and his droll, sometimes minimalist, patter: Priestley recalled the simple phrase &#145;comic business with chapeau&#146; closing a piece which had involved endless failed attempts to pick up a hat.<br>
<br>Little Tich was a member of the charitable Grand Order of Water Rats and was King Rat in 1906. He was also a strong supporter of the 1907 variety strike. He painted in oils and watercolours, played the cello, and was a talented linguist. His personal life was complex. He married an English dancer, Laurie Brooks (<i>d</i>. 1901), in Illinois on 20 January 1889. Their son, Paul (1889&#150;1948), later had a generally unsuccessful theatrical career which borrowed extensively from his father's act. The marriage ended in 1897 when Laurie departed, along with a considerable amount of her husband's savings and furniture. He lived with a Spanish dancer, Julia R&eacute;cio, from about 1898, and eventually married her on 31 March 1904. Their relationship was far from happy, and Tich had a number of liaisons before meeting the actress Ivy Latimer (1892&#150;1973) (born Winifred Emma Ivey), in 1916. They had a daughter, Mary, in 1918, who was the co-author of an informative biography of her father. The couple married three months after Julia's death in 1926.<br>
<br>Shortly after receiving a heavy blow to the head in an on-stage accident in November 1927, Little Tich suffered a stroke from which he never recovered. He died at his house, 93 Shirehall Park, Hendon, London, on 10 February 1928, and was buried in Marylebone cemetery. He was undoubtedly one of the most popular music-hall and variety acts of all time and influenced a number of British and European performers. Many commentators claimed that the visual trickery employed by many early film comedians owed much to his example and imagination.<br>
