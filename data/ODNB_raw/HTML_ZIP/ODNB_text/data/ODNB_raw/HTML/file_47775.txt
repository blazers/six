<span class="headword">Collet, Sir  Mark Wilks</span>, first baronet  (1816&#150;1905), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born at Highbury Grove, Highbury, Middlesex, the second of three sons of James Collet, a native of the Isle of Man, and his wife, Wendelina Elizabeth van Brienen, of Dutch origin. His father died when Mark was young, and his mother initially moved to Douglas, Isle of Man, and subsequently to Archangel, Russia, where her family were merchants. Mark was educated in Archangel, where he learned both Russian and French; his first language, which he used with his mother, was German. In 1832 Wendelina returned to London, where she ran a boarding-house, and Mark became a clerk in Liverpool with Henry Patry &amp; Co., a firm associated with the leading London merchant house of Thomas Wilson &amp; Co. Collet was henceforth to devote his career to trade with the United States.<br>
<br>Collet claimed in 1833 that his main recreation was listening to sermons, and he was a deeply religious man throughout his life, who believed that subordination to an all-powerful and all-wise God gave strength to bear any problems. Certainly, he had his share of family responsibilities, for he supported both his mother and his two feckless and incompetent brothers. The consolations of religion also helped him in his own difficulties, for Thomas Wilson &amp; Co. failed in the crash of 1837, when a number of merchant houses specializing in the Anglo-American trade failed. The business was taken over by Purton, Parker &amp; Co., with whom Collet continued as a clerk, making two trips to the United States in 1840&#150;42. The firm was not successful, and was dissolved in 1842. Although Collet would have preferred to remain with a merchant house, he reluctantly accepted a position as sub-manager of the Bank of Liverpool, at a salary of &pound;500. He returned to his mercantile career in 1846 as a partner of J. W. Cater and Thomas Arnott, whose partnership in the existing Liverpool merchant house of J. W. Cater &amp; Co. was dissolved and reconstituted as J. W. Cater, Collet &amp; Co. in London and J. W. Cater &amp; Co. in Liverpool. The capital of &pound;30,000 was supplied by Cater, who took a minimal role in the business, drawing interest and a small share of the profits. Arnott ran the business in Liverpool in return for a quarter of the profits and &pound;750 a year; Collet was responsible for the business in London, for which he received a third of the profits and a salary of &pound;1000 a year. Collet followed the pattern of many able men without capital, providing the expertise which allowed firms to continue despite the absence of capable family members in the next generation. The initial term of partnership was seven years, with the right to give notice after three or five years, an option which Collet used in 1851 when he was approached by another, more prestigious, American merchant house which urgently needed a new partner: Brown, Shipley &amp; Co.<br>
<br>The business of Brown Shipley had been developed by the family of Alexander Brown (1764&#150;1834), a Belfast linen merchant, who had emigrated to Baltimore in 1800, where he became a successful general merchant. One son, John, was sent to Philadelphia in 1818 to establish John A. Brown; another son, James, went to New York in 1825 to form Brown Brothers; and Alexander Brown &amp; Sons continued in Baltimore. The eldest son, William (1784&#150;1864), left for Liverpool in 1808, where he became a major merchant, above all in raw cotton, which was ordered from his father's agents in the American south. In 1825 William was joined by Joseph Shipley, an American who was agent in Liverpool for a Philadelphian merchant. He was crucial to the survival of the firm in the crisis of 1837, and the name of the firm was subsequently changed to Brown Shipley when he became a partner in Liverpool and the firms in the United States.<br>
<br>Increasingly, the focus of the business shifted from trade to finance, and away from Baltimore and Philadelphia to Brown Brothers in New York, and William devoted more time to politics. Shipley was responsible for most of the business, with the assistance of F. A. Hamilton, who had been the Browns' agent in New Orleans before he was offered a partnership in 1845. When Shipley retired and returned to America in 1850 it was crucial to recruit a new junior partner, and the choice fell on Collet, whose expertise in American trade finance was invaluable. With some hesitation, he accepted the offer of 26,000 shares to become a partner.<br>
<br>Collet was, like other major figures in the City of London, a meritocrat whose technical skills and business competence were crucial to the success of a family firm. Such men were sometimes kept in salaried positions and denied partnerships; in other cases, they became junior partners with a share in the profits, who were accorded less status. The relationship between family and non-family members was prone to tensions, and a careful negotiation of the competing dictates of a competitive market and dynastic ambitions was crucial for continued success. In the case of Collet and the Brown family, the relationship was threatened on two occasions in the 1860s, when Collet complained that he was exploited and slighted by the family.<br>
<br>William Brown died in 1864, and left his shares to his brother James in New York, who failed to increase the holdings of Collet and Hamilton, much to their annoyance. It was, Collet informed Hamilton, unreasonable that James &#145;should appropriate to his family the shares which have been held out to the Juniors for years as their future reward&#146;  (Collet to Hamilton, 15 Aug 1865, Collet MS U1287, C79/5). When Collet was offered additional shares, he angrily complained that they were inadequate recompense for his work, and was even more outraged by the demand that he cede power to James to dispose of shares and appoint his successors as senior partners by will. Collet was horrified that his and Hamilton's judgement should be ignored and their property controlled by an unknown nominee. &#145;If Mr Brown suspects you or me of any design in the event of his death to oust his family and to appropriate to ourselves the goodwill and style of the house, he grievously misjudges the men who have placed a confidence in him, which should have called forth some response of a similar feeling towards ourselves&#146;  (Collet to Hamilton, 8 April 1865, ibid.).<br>
<br>Brown responded by simply handing all the shares to his son. James Brown, it seemed to the aggrieved junior partners, &#145;wishes to legislate for eternity&#146; with the result that he was threatening the survival of the firm through his &#145;foolish attempt to obtain advantages to the detriment of others in which he is not likely to succeed&#146;  (Hamilton to Collet, 7 and 10 April 1865, Collet MS U1287, C79/6). The tension resurfaced in 1868, when two issues collided. Collet was weary of his &#145;severe and incessant labour&#146; and wished for some relief through the appointment of another partner, provided that it did not mean the renewal of a &#145;claim to an absolute hereditary proprietorship in the House&#146; and the appointment of a senior partner over his head  (Collet to Hamilton, 3 and 7 March 1868, ibid., C79/9). At the same time, James Brown was contemplating retirement and the withdrawal of his capital, or at most leaving it in the firm without bearing risks. Collet feared that the firm would decline to second-class status, and that the junior partners would be left to bear the risks and the work. &#145;If the family wish to maintain the House&#146;, he pointed out to Hamilton, &#145;they must assume the risks incident to doing so; certainly, it would not be fair nor just to ourselves if we tied ourselves to stay and keep our property in and liable, while they seriously reduced theirs&#146;  (Collet to Hamilton, 19 March 1868, ibid.). Although the immediate crisis passed, the problems of the 1860s exposed in a stark way the difficulties of reconciling the hereditary principle with the maintenance of a successful firm. The attempt to entrench family control alienated the junior partners, who were often the more competent members of the firm; the withdrawal of capital left non-family members to carry risks to an unacceptable extent.<br>
<br>Despite the slight to Collet's self-esteem, he became a leading figure in the establishment of the City after the main operation of Brown Shipley moved from Liverpool to London in 1863. He became a director of the Bank of England in 1866, and served until his death; he was governor in 1887&#150;9 and was created baronet in 1888. He amassed a fortune of &pound;248,500 by the end of 1876, with his house at 2 Sussex Square, London, and personal investments valued at &pound;88,500; the balance was presumably in the firm. In 1878 he bought a small estate of 399 acres, St Clere, Kemsing, in Kent, for &pound;50,000, and subsequently invested in a wide portfolio of English and American shares. Meanwhile, the firm was trapped in conservative ways, largely dependent on supplying credit to customers of Brown Brothers in New York, and the aged Collet was not the man to revive the firm. He pointed out, rather defensively, to Brown Brothers in 1899 that even J. P. Morgan had difficulties in finding a suitable partner in London and it was scarcely surprising that he had no more success  (Kynaston, 190&#150;91).<br>
<br>Eventually, the answer was found through dynastic ambitions which the Browns no doubt appreciated. On 23 July 1850 Collet had married, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Susanna Gertrude, the daughter of James Eyre, a Church of England priest. She died in 1851, leaving a daughter, Linda Susan Penelope, who married in 1870 Frederick William Norman, the son of Collet's fellow director of the Bank of England, Geoffrey Warde Norman. Frederick Norman was a director of Martin's Bank, and their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35252/', "Montagu Collet Norman")</script> (Collet's grandson), spent some time at Martin's before joining Brown Shipley in 1894. He gained experience in the United States before he became a partner in 1900. Only in 1903, after service in the South African War, did he take an active role in the firm. Montagu Norman proved to be Collet's successor in business; Collet's heir to the landed estate was his son by his second marriage, on 8 May 1862, to Antonia Frederica, the daughter of Joseph Edlmann, merchant, of Chislehurst in Kent. Their only child, Mark Edlmann Collet, was born in 1864, but he took no interest in the City, and settled in the south of France with his invalid wife before moving to the Isle of Man. Collet died on 25 April 1905 at his London house, 2 Sussex Square, of bronchial pneumonia.<br>
