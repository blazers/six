</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Porteus,  Beilby</span>  (1731&#150;1809), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, born at York on 8 May 1731, was youngest but one of the nineteen children of Robert Porteus (<i>d</i>. 1758/9), planter, and his wife, Sarah Jennings. His parents were natives of the American colony of Virginia and had lived on their own estate, which grew chiefly tobacco. His mother was the daughter of Colonel Jennings, superintendent of Indian affairs in Virginia, and is said to have been related to Sarah Jennings, duchess of Marlborough. Ill health and a wish to procure a better education for his children drove Porteus's father to return to England in 1720, and the family settled at York. Beilby Porteus was educated first at York, then at Mr Hyde's school, Ripon. At the age of seventeen he was admitted, through his brother's influence, as sizar at Christ's College, Cambridge. He was made a scholar on 19 November 1748 and he graduated BA in 1752, as tenth wrangler; he also won the second chancellor's medal for classics. He was subsequently elected a fellow of his college, which led to a period that he described as one of the happiest of his life. He accepted the office of esquire bedel, not because he felt himself especially suited to it but to ease financial pressure on his father. To further assist this end he took private pupils, who included Thomas Robinson, later second Baron Grantham and secretary of state under Shelburne. In 1757 he was ordained deacon, and in the same year he was ordained priest by Archbishop Hutton of York. In 1759 he won the Seatonian prize for an English poem, &#145;Death&#146;, inspired perhaps by the recent death of his father. Though, in the opinion of his biographer, &#145;as a juvenile performance there are none finer&#146; his elegy on the death of George II earned a lampoon in Thackeray's <span class="italic">The Four Georges</span>:<blockquote>Here was one who had neither dignity, learning, morals nor wit&#151;who tainted a great Society by bad example; who in youth, manhood, old age was gross, low and sensual; and Mr Porteus, the divine who wept these tears over George the Second's memory wore George the Third's lawn. I don't know whether people still admire his poetry or his sermons. (W. M. Thackeray, &#145;The first four Georges: sketches of manners, morals, court and town life&#146;, <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, 2, 1860, 191)</blockquote>Porteus did at least win notice for his sermons in the 1760s, and his university sermon, in 1761, on the character of King David (a reply to a pamphlet by the deist Peter Annet, <span class="italic">The History of the Man after God's Own Heart</span>) may have helped his appointment in 1762 as chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker. He moved to Lambeth. He was appointed by Secker to two livings in Kent, Rucking and Wittersham, but soon afterwards took instead Hunton, another Kent rectorship. He was made a prebend of Peterborough in 1764 and rector of Lambeth in 1767. Porteus did not neglect his domestic life, and on 13 May 1765 he married Margaret, daughter of Bryan Hodgson, landlord of The George inn, Stamford. He proceeded DD at Cambridge, where his sermon on the necessity of instructing youth in the principles of revealed religion influenced John Norris (<i>d</i>. 1777) to found the Norrisian professorship of divinity. He was appointed chaplain to the king in 1769 and master of St Cross Hospital in Winchester in 1773. In 1776 he was promoted to the bishopric of Chester. He resigned Lambeth but kept the valuable living of Hunton; it was thought praiseworthy that he had not kept both.<br>
<br>Porteus was a very energetic bishop of Chester, a post which he held for eleven years. He encouraged the rising evangelical school; he instituted a fund for the relief of poorer clergy in the diocese; he warmly encouraged the foundation of Sunday schools in every parish. He was also soon to show that activity in the House of Lords which would also mark his later period as bishop of London. In 1777, acting for the incapacitated bishop of London, Dr Lowth, he piloted through the Lords a measure to stop incumbents giving general bonds of resignation (bonds to resign whenever the patrons required them) and for many years&#151;with ultimate success in 1800&#151;he fought a campaign to stop a species of simony in the form of purchase of advowson of a living. He was also to show an early interest in the campaign against the slave trade that would mark his later career by writing a pamphlet (1784) that called upon the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to set an example for slave owners by the management of its own estates in Barbados.<br>
<br>Porteus gained quite a reputation for his sermons in the 1770s. A contemporary, Job Orton, described them as &#145;super-excellent&#146;  (Ippel, 46). He earned less favourable comment from Horace Walpole for his sermon preached for the general fast in 1776: &#145;The Fast Sermon of Dr Porteus let loose all the zeal of the clergy and contributed to raise the infatuation of England against America&#146;. This seems a little unfair; the main theme of Porteus's address was opposition to the licentious and luxurious habits of the English themselves, a topic to which he was perhaps improbably to return in the euphoniously entitled <span class="italic">Letter to the inhabitants of Manchester, Macclesfield and the adjacent places on the occasion of the recent earthquake</span> (1777).<br>
<br>In 1787 Porteus succeeded Lowth as bishop of London. He was from the first a warm supporter of evangelicals, though he did not himself identify with all their views&#151;he was decidedly anti-Calvinistic. He was a staunch supporter of Hannah More for many years. He threw himself eagerly into the work of the newly formed Society for Enforcing the King's Proclamation against Immorality and Idleness, known as the Proclamation Society. Given his support for George III's moral crusade, it was appropriate that Porteus, as bishop of London, preached the sermon at the service of thanksgiving for the king's recovery held at St Paul's on 23 April 1789. He made full use of his position to further the interest of the campaign to abolish the slave trade; he tried, but failed, to see Sir William Dolben's <span class="roman">Slave Carrying Bill</span> through the Lords (1788). He successfully transferred a bequest of Robert Boyle, made in 1691 and intended for missionary work in America, to his own Society for the Conversion and Religious Instruction of the Negroes of the West Indies. He was an early patron of the Church Missionary Society and vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society, having recommended John Shore, first Baron Teignmouth, as its first president.<br>
<br>Though sometimes called a Methodist, Porteus was strict at all times in enforcing the discipline and doctrine of the church. He excluded from the parishes in his diocese Dr Draper, sometime president of a college in the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, and incurred no little odium for so doing. In 1779 he had approved relief of Catholics from the penal law but he was no supporter of Catholic emancipation, especially the abortive bill of 1805. Porteus took a great interest in securing the due observance of religious holidays. He wrote a letter on the neglect of Good Friday to his Lambeth parishioners in 1776, which resulted in stricter observance of the day throughout London; the letter was later published by the SPCK. In 1780 he had campaigned to put down two London practices, Sunday debates and Sunday promenades. In 1787, newly as bishop, he produced a <span class="italic">Letter to the Clergy of London on the Profanation of the Lord's Day</span>. In 1794 he stopped building work on the new Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, going forward on a Sunday, and in 1795 he persuaded the king to abandon Sunday card parties. Not long before his death in 1809 he was petitioning Prince George to change the meeting day of a club that he frequented on Sundays. In 1805 the manager of the King's Theatre had to end a production in order to avoid threatened prosecution by Porteus if the show should continue past midnight and hence into Sunday. Porteus was indifferent to the criticism that this particular campaign brought him.<br>
<br>Porteus's tenure of the diocese of London&#151;which then contained vast areas beyond the metropolitan area&#151;coincided with the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars. He vigorously resisted the spread of French revolutionary principles, which he regarded with alarm. He was particularly exercised over the influence of the work of Thomas Paine, whose <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span> had, he said, &#145;rendered irreligion easy to the meanest capacity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.276&#150;7); he reported that he had heard cases of coalminers selling their bibles in order to buy copies of the work. It was specifically to counter the influence of &#145;one Paine, an American&#146;, as Porteus referred to him, that he commissioned Hannah More's <span class="italic">Village Politics</span>, 1793  (Porteus, diary, 30 March 1791, MS 2100, fol. 25). In his charge to the clergy of his diocese for 1794 (he was commenting on the lately published posthumous works of Frederick II) he laid the blame for such developments with the continental <i>philosophes</i> of the European Enlightenment:<blockquote>These philosophers reject all idea of Providence and of a moral governor of the world. They ascribe every event to fortune, or to necessity, or to choice: They decried the existence of the soul distinct from the body; they conceived man to be nothing more than a piece of clockwork, which when the wheels refuse to act, stands still and loses all power of motion for ever. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.266&#150;7)</blockquote>In 1795, with Paine himself beyond its reach, Porteus's Proclamation Society prosecuted the printer of Paine's <span class="italic">Age of Reason</span>, Thomas Williams. By a nice irony they retained Thomas Erskine, a prominent radical lawyer, for the task. The whig <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> deprecated the zeal in the matter of the &#145;Reverend Prosecutors&#146; (26 February 1798).<br>
<br>To counteract the spread of infidelity and the &#145;growing relaxation of public manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.vi) Porteus delivered, in St James's, Piccadilly, a series of lectures on Fridays in Lent in four successive years, beginning in 1798. Crowds attended them and they caused formidable queues of carriages in Piccadilly&#151;whether full of sceptical coalminers history does not relate. Unlike the <i>philosophes</i> Porteus himself had a keen sense of the workings of Providence. In particular he thought it necessary to earn the benevolence of Providence&#151;and hence success in the war&#151;through redress of offences. High among these he would put the slave trade; it has already been mentioned how he had involved himself in this issue since the early 1780s. From the 1790s until 1807 Porteus was a leading figure in the effort to get abolition through both houses of parliament. It was difficult for detractors of such a campaign to label it Jacobinical&#151;though they tried&#151;with a figure such as Porteus in the lists in favour of it. It was commented upon by Horace Walpole and others that the bishops formed a party of the crown in the Lords and, though in the main this might have been true, Porteus and his brethren voted consistently against three royal dukes on the slave trade issue. There was an early success with a bill to limit the trade to southern equatorial Africa in 1799; throughout 1806 and 1807 Porteus attended and voted in the Lords for abolition. He was, however, quick to dissociate himself from a campaign, as early as 1808, to proceed to the abolition of the institution of slavery itself. An effort was made to recruit his energies for a campaign to take action against the prevalence of prostitution in London in 1808 but by then he was fading. He died at Fulham Palace on 14 May 1809 and was buried at Sundridge, Kent. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>Porteus had ample means and made liberal use of them. He was generous to poorer clergy and attempted to raise the stipends and status of assistant curates. He endowed his former college, Christ's, Cambridge, with &pound;1200 for three medals: for a Latin dissertation on the evidences for Christianity, for an English essay on some precept of the gospel, and for reading the lessons in the college chapel.<br>
