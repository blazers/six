<span class="headword">Ferrabosco,  Alfonso</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1543, <em>d.</em> 1588), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at Bologna and baptized in the cathedral of San Petronio there on 18 January 1543, the eldest son of Domenico Maria Ferrabosco (1513&#150;1574), a singer and composer, and Giulia Novelli dall'Arpa (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1578). On 5 August 1552 he was appointed overseer of the office of immigration taxes in Bologna (a sinecure). By 1559 he was in the service of Charles of Guise, cardinal of Lorraine, and, together with two younger brothers, participated in Du Bellay's <span class="italic">Epithalame</span> intended for the wedding of Princess Marguerite of France and Emanuele Filiberto, duke of Savoy.<br>
<br>A reward on 28 March 1562 shows Ferrabosco to be at the English court, where he was paid an annual pension of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. between 1562 and 1567. As a groom or gentleman of the privy chamber (both descriptions are given) he had direct contact with the queen, unlike an ordinary court musician. For want of evidence it is assumed he was a lutenist and singer. Ferrabosco was briefly absent in the service of Cardinal Farnese in Rome, and in June 1564 wished to return to England. The cardinal refused to release him, but he escaped. Back at the English court, Ferrabosco was granted a life annuity in 1567 at &pound;100 p.a. on condition that he should remain in Elizabeth's service. This did not prevent him from travelling (perhaps on occasion as a spy). Setting out with his brother to settle his affairs in Italy, he wrote from Paris on 25 June 1569 with news that he had been robbed, but planned to return to England forthwith. Further letters of 30 October 1569 and 28 September 1570, from Bologna, indicated he had been unable to obtain the necessary travel licence. Meanwhile his father had arranged for him another sinecure in Bologna.<br>
<br>In England again, Ferrabosco collected his annuity in 1571. In June 1572 he participated in a masque at Whitehall. On 23 October 1574 he asked permission to return to Bologna to attend to family affairs; in 1575 he was stated to be travelling in France, but by the following November he was in London again delivering messages from the queen to a diplomatic mission from Venice. On 27 February 1576 he performed in Ubaldino's Italian comedy at Whitehall.<br>
<br>Difficulties soon arose in Ferrabosco's relations with queen and court, though the circumstances are unclear. For some reason he petitioned for his annuity to be halved to &pound;50 and for numerous leases to be granted to a William Fysher. This took effect from midsummer 1576. In a letter of 23 September 1577 Ferrabosco reveals that he had recently returned to London to find himself in some disgrace and without his accustomed access to the queen. One reason bandied about was that he had attended mass in the house of the French ambassador. Writing to Lord Burghley on 26 September 1577, Ferrabosco described other visits he had made there, suggesting that his enemies used these to discredit him. On 13 October he denied robbing and murdering a servant of Sir Philip Sidney, and in a third letter of 29 December he asked the earl of Sussex to intercede for him at court.<br>
<br>Because of these troubles Ferrabosco seems to have decided to leave England. Perhaps in part to smooth forthcoming travel arrangements, he married Susanna Symons at St Botolph, Aldgate, on 2 May 1578; she is presumed to be the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9353/', "Alfonso Ferrabosco (c.1575&#150;1628)")</script> and an unnamed daughter, whom the couple left in the care of Gommar van Oosterwijck, a court flautist. They were in Paris by 23 June 1578, when Anselmo Dandino, papal nuncio in France, wrote to Rome that Ferrabosco had come as musician to the cardinal of Lorraine and that he suspected that Ferrabosco was a spy. Ferrabosco left Paris for Italy on 30 September 1578, with plans for his wife to join him there later. On arrival he was imprisoned on the pope's orders on suspicion of disloyalty to the Roman Catholic church; Queen Elizabeth persuaded Catherine de' Medici to intercede for Ferrabosco's release and he was free by October 1580. His English annuity ceased at Lady day 1582. He was in Turin by February 1582, having taken up service there with Carlo Emanuele I, duke of Savoy.<br>
<br>Ferrabosco published two collections of madrigals (1587), and vocal works by him appear in some fifteen other collections published between 1572 and 1613. In all about two hundred vocal pieces (rather more madrigals than motets) and some thirty instrumental works survive. He was highly regarded by his English contemporaries (there are tributes by John Baldwin, Thomas Morley, Thomas Campion, Henry Peacham, and Charles Butler); most extant manuscript copies of his music are in English libraries. No example has been found of a publication&#151;listed by the Stationers' Company (15 October 1603) and mentioned by Morley&#151;of a friendly competition between Ferrabosco and William Byrd in making forty two-part pieces on the plainsong <span class="italic">Miserere</span>. A fire in 1904 destroyed the bulk of the holograph literary manuscript <span class="italic">Dell'historia D'Altimauro composta per Alfonso Ferrabosco</span> in the university library at Turin.<br>
<br>In 1584, according to Gommar van Oosterwijck, &#145;Alfonso did send commission &hellip; to bring him his children&#146;  (Charteris, <span class="italic">Thematic Catalogue</span>, 36&#150;7), but the queen intervened to prevent this. In 1585 Ferrabosco attended the duke of Savoy when he travelled to Spain to marry Catherine of Austria. He was appointed &#145;gentiluomo ordinario di nostra bocca&#146; and granted a life pension on 6 March 1586. He died on 12 August 1588 in Bologna and was buried in the church of Sant' Isaja. The duke made provision for Ferrabosco's widow and his two children born in Italy, Carlo Emanuele and Caterina.<br>
