<span class="headword">Washington,  John</span>  (1800&#150;1863), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, entered the navy in May 1812 on the frigate <i>Juno</i>, in which he served on the operations in the Chesapeake. In October 1813 he was moved into the <i>Sybille</i>, then in November 1814 he joined the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, from which he passed out in May 1816 with the gold medal for mathematics. He then served for three years in the <i>Forth</i> on the North American station, and afterwards in the <i>Vengeur</i> and the <i>Superb</i> on the South American station, where he was promoted lieutenant on 1 January 1821. He was then at Valpara&iacute;so, and gained permission to return to England by an adventurous journey across the Andes and the pampas to Buenos Aires.<br>
<br>In February 1823 Washington was appointed to the sloop <i>Parthian</i> in the West Indies, after which he was for two years on half pay, and travelled in France, Spain, and Italy, improving his knowledge of their languages. In May 1827 he was appointed to the <i>Weazle</i> in the Mediterranean, and in December was moved to the frigate <i>Dartmouth</i>, returning to England in the following spring. During this time he obtained leave, and travelled in Morocco with Edward William Auriol Drummond-Hay, and determined several positions by astronomical observations. From 1830 to 1833 he was flag lieutenant to Sir John Poo Beresford, commander-in-chief at the Nore, and on 14 August 1833 was promoted commander. On 3 September 1833 he married Eleonora, youngest daughter of the Revd H. Askew, rector of Greystoke, Cumberland. They had three sons.<br>
<br>From 1836 to 1841 Washington was secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was one of the original members. With one clerk, he did the whole work of the society, the early success of which was largely due to his energy. In March 1841 he was appointed to the steamer <i>Shearwater</i>, for surveying work on the east coast of England, and in January 1842 was temporarily lent to the yacht <i>Black Eagle</i>, appointed to bring the king of Prussia to England. In compliment to the king, Washington was made captain on 16 March. In January 1843 he was moved to the steamer <i>Blazer</i>, in which he continued the survey of the east coast until 1847. In January 1845 he was also appointed a commissioner for inquiring into the state of the rivers, shores, and harbours of the United Kingdom, and in February was elected FRS. Afterwards he was employed in the railway and harbour department of the Admiralty; in 1853, making a visit to Denmark, Sweden, and Russia to investigate a new type of lifeboat, he was directed by Sir James Graham, then first lord of the Admiralty, to obtain information on the Russian Baltic fleet and the defences of Kronstadt, Reval, and Sveaborg. Surprisingly, he was given full facilities by the Russians, including witnessing their fleet manoeuvres, and returned impressed by the strength of the Russian defences. He became assistant to Sir Francis Beaufort the hydrographer in 1854, and on Beaufort's resignation in 1855 Washington was appointed his successor. He held this office until his death, having been promoted to the rank of rear-admiral on 12 April 1862.<br>
<br>Under the pressure of the Crimean War, Washington managed to gain necessary increases in staff in the hydrographic office. He was less successful in moving the office from the unsalubrious attics of the Admiralty, and his recommendation to abolish the separate class of masters was unpopular ashore and afloat. Several ship casualties attributed, wrongly except in one case, to shortcomings in the hydrographer's department preyed on his sensitive nature. The last straw came when his second son, on return from the China station, was almost immediately sent abroad again despite Washington's pleas to the contrary. Washington became seriously ill and, on his way home from a short visit to Switzerland, died of &#145;nervous ailments&#146; on 16 September 1863 at Le Havre; he was buried on 19 September in the protestant cemetery there. His wife survived him.<br>
