<span class="headword">Wilson,  Walter Gordon</span>  (1874&#150;1957), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer</span>, was born in Blackrock, co. Dublin, on 21 April 1874, the fifth son of George Orr Wilson, barrister, and his wife, Annie Shaw. Wilson started his career as a naval cadet in the <i>Britannia</i>. In 1894 he entered King's College, Cambridge, where he was elected to an honorary exhibition in 1896, and in 1897 was placed in the first class in part one of the mechanical sciences tripos.<br>
<br>The inventive genius that characterized the engineering achievements for which Wilson later became known was demonstrated in his first engineering venture. Through Lord Braye, Wilson was introduced to Percy Pilcher, a lecturer in naval architecture and a keen glider. Wilson observed Pilcher's gliding activities with a profound technical interest and soon became enthused with the possibilities of powered flight. In 1898 the three formed the firm of Wilson and Pilcher with the primary objective of building what might have been the world's first internal combustion aero-engine. One year later Wilson had designed a prototype engine which Pilcher was to test, but before it was built Pilcher was killed in a gliding accident in 1899. The shock put an end to Wilson's plans for powered flight and he looked instead at the &#145;horseless carriage&#146;. In new premises in Westminster he created the Wilson&#150;Pilcher motor car embodying epicyclic gears and some remarkable new features which in later years came to be regarded as the hallmark of good design in motor cars of quality.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1904 Wilson married Ethel Crommelin (<i>d</i>. 1963), daughter of Samuel Octavius Gray, chief accountant to the Bank of England; they had three sons. In the same year he joined the firm of Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., where he designed the Armstrong Whitworth car. From 1908 to 1914 he worked with J. and E. Hall of Dartford and designed for them the Hallford lorry, which was extensively used by the army during the First World War.<br>
<br>When war broke out Wilson rejoined the navy and served as a lieutenant with the Royal Naval armoured car division, which at that time was defending naval air bases on the coasts of France and Belgium. Already well known as an engineer he was soon engaged in the construction of armoured vehicles. When Winston Churchill set up the landships committee under Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt at the Admiralty in early 1915 to investigate the possibility of building an armoured fighting vehicle capable of resisting rifle and machine-gun fire, destroying barbed wire entanglements, and crossing trenches, squadron 20 of the armoured car division was placed at the committee's disposal. Wilson was posted to squadron 20 and placed in charge of the first experiments at Burton upon Trent. So he came to play a leading role in the birth of the tank.<br>
<br>Wilson and his colleague in design, William Tritton, created a machine capable of the tasks required of it; the speedy success of the tank was chiefly due to the inventive genius and engineering skill of these two men. In August 1915 the design of the Tritton vehicle, or &#145;Little Willie&#146;, was already well advanced when fresh and more stringent requirements were laid down by the War Office. To meet them, Tritton and Wilson concentrated on a new design, on which they were already working, in which the tracks, at Wilson's suggestion, were carried all round the vehicle. This design, known first as the Wilson, then the Centipede, next &#145;Big Willie&#146;, was ready for official trials early in 1916. On 2 February in Lord Salisbury's park at Hatfield, before a company that included Kitchener, Balfour, Lloyd George, and General Robertson, it successfully demonstrated its ability to fulfil not only the official requirements but also far more exacting tests. Production orders were placed immediately and &#145;Big Willie&#146;, now named &#145;Mother&#146;, became the prototype of the Mark I tank which went into action on the Somme in September 1916. Other designs followed, and Wilson's development of epicyclic transmissions for these vehicles was an achievement of outstanding importance, culminating in 1937 with his design for a new epicyclic steering which provided a larger turning radius at high speeds than at low speeds.<br>
<br>Wilson transferred to the army in March 1916 with the rank of major in the heavy branch, machine-gun corps, renamed in 1917 the Royal Tank Corps. He served as chief of design in the mechanical warfare department of the War Office until the war ended. He was twice mentioned in dispatches and was appointed CMG in 1917.<br>
<br>After the war he invented the well-known Wilson self-changing gearbox, used in many cars, and founded the firm of Self-Changing Gears Ltd, of Coventry. He was an honorary member of the Institution of Automobile Engineers, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and the Junior Institution of Engineers, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. A man of strong character and shrewd judgement, he was a great lover of the countryside, a fine shot and an expert fly fisher.<br>
<br>Wilson died at his home, The Elms, Itchen Abbas, near Winchester, on 30 June 1957.<br>
