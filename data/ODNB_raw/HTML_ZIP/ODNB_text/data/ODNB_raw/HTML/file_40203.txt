<span class="headword">Bentinck,  Victor Frederick William  Cavendish-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Bill Bentinck]</span>, ninth duke of Portland  (1897&#150;1990), <span class="occ">diplomatist and businessman</span>, was born on 18 June 1897 at 16 Mansfield Street, London. He was the younger son and third of the four children of (William George) Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck (1856&#150;1948), barrister, who managed the ducal family's Marylebone estate, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63832/', "Ruth Mary Cavendish-Bentinck (1867&#150;1953)")</script>, who was the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49739/', "Edward Adolphus Ferdinand St Maur, Earl St Maur")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25164/', "St Maur, Edward Adolphus, twelfth duke of Somerset")</script>], a son of the duke of Somerset, and was reputed to have Gypsy blood. Bill Bentinck was educated at Wellington College, but left at seventeen without making a mark and in August 1916 was appointed honorary attach&eacute; at the British legation at Christiania (Oslo). In 1918 he enlisted and trained with the household brigade but saw no active service. He entered the diplomatic service in 1919, missing the chance of university education, and was posted as third secretary to the legation at Warsaw. It was as ambassador at Warsaw twenty-seven years later that he ended a diplomatic career in which he achieved special distinction as chairman of the wartime joint intelligence committee (1939&#150;45). In 1922 he began work in the Foreign Office and took charge of administrative arrangements for the Lausanne conference before moving to the embassy in Paris as second secretary. There in 1924 he contracted a marriage that soon cast a shadow over a very promising career. His wife, Clothilde, was the daughter of James Bruce Quigley, a lawyer from Kentucky; her lifestyle was extravagant and she had a talent for quarrelling with other diplomatic wives. Bentinck was a conciliator by nature, though well able to fight his corner. His tall, stooping figure and rather myopic look belied the resolution he displayed in a crisis.<br>
<br>Back in the Foreign Office in 1925, Bentinck served in the League of Nations department and had a useful role at the Locarno conference. He was promoted first secretary and sent back to Paris in 1928; but, as his domestic problems worsened, assignments grew shorter and further from the &#145;inner circle&#146;: Athens in 1932 was followed by Santiago in 1933. In 1937, however, he was recalled to the Foreign Office as assistant in the Egyptian department and there acquired experience of handling military matters. In the summer of 1939 his wife left without warning for the USA, taking their two children&#151;a boy and a girl. Her departure coincided with the high point of his diplomatic career, when the Foreign Office, which had been reluctant to pool intelligence with the armed services, appointed him chairman of the joint intelligence committee and he found himself, as a civilian and relatively junior, reporting to the chiefs of staff. His perceptiveness and tact enabled him to overcome service rivalries and weld the joint intelligence committee into a highly effective instrument. He was appointed CMG in 1942 and promoted counsellor to head the newly created services liaison department of the Foreign Office.<br>
<br>Despite wartime success, Bentinck's diplomatic career was doomed. He had formed a close friendship with a Canadian, Kathleen Elsie, widow of Arthur Richie Tillotson and daughter of Arthur Barry of Montreal, but his absent wife refused to divorce him. He explained his difficulties to the Foreign Office, which persuaded him in July 1945 to take the key post of ambassador to Poland, a country which had fallen under Soviet control. The communist-dominated government did its utmost to sabotage his mission and in February 1947 the Foreign Office withdrew him and applied to Brazil for his <i>agr&eacute;ment</i> as ambassador. In March his suit for divorce came before the court and was exploited by his wife to discredit him. The resultant publicity obliged the Foreign Office to withdraw the request for <i>agr&eacute;ment</i>. He then resigned, thus forfeiting his pension under Treasury regulations. The Court of Appeal finally granted his divorce and in July 1948 he married Kathleen Tillotson.<br>
<br>Bentinck had lost no time in finding remunerative work as vice-chairman of the committee of industrial interests in Germany, becoming chairman in 1949. In addition to advancing the interests of major British companies such as Unilever, he formed close connections with leading German companies, such as Bayer AG. He promoted the German and Belgian nuclear industries and was awarded a high German decoration (Bundesverdienstkreuz). On the death of his elder brother in 1979, he became the ninth duke of Portland; but he inherited neither land nor capital, since the entail had been broken eight years previously by the seventh duke. His son, William, had died of heart failure in 1966, leaving no children. When he himself died at his home, 21 Carlyle Square, Chelsea, London, on 30 July 1990, the dukedom created in 1716 became extinct.<br>
