<span class="headword">Ashwell,  Lena</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Lena Margaret Pocock; <em>married name </em>Lena Margaret Simson, Lady Simson]</span>  (1872&#150;1957), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was born on 28 September 1872 aboard a training ship moored in the Tyne, the <i>Wellesley</i>, the daughter of Captain Charles Ashwell Botelar Pocock and his wife, Sarah Margaret Stevens. She was the third daughter in a large and religious family; one of her brothers, Roger Pocock, later became a traveller and founder of the Legion of Frontiersmen. When she was eight the family moved to Canada at Brockwell on the St Lawrence River. Here her father became a minister and Lena Ashwell was educated at Bishop Strachan's School for Young Ladies in Toronto and the University of Toronto, and later specialized in music at the Swiss State School, the Lausanne conservatoire, and the Royal Academy of Music in London. On the advice of Ellen Terry, who was adjudicating an elocution class in which she was training, Ashwell gave up her career in music in favour of one in acting. She used her father's middle name professionally.<br>
<br>Lena Ashwell eventually found acting work through the professional support of Malcolm Watson (later theatre correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>) and her first engagement as an actress was in a production of <span class="italic">The Pharisee</span> by M. Watson and Mrs L. Wallis in March 1891. By 1892 she was touring with George Alexander in Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span>. Various London and touring roles followed but it was as Elaine in Comyns Carr's <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> with Henry Irving that she gained significant critical notice in 1895. Ashwell was now in constant employment and her role as Mrs Dane in Charles Wyndham's production of <span class="italic">Mrs Dane's Defence</span> (1900) by H. A. Jones brought her into the ranks of one of the half-dozen leading actresses of the day. From this point on she was often given lead female roles such as Katusha in <span class="italic">Resurrection</span> (1903) by M. Morton, Leah in <span class="italic">Leah Kleschna</span> by C. M. S. McLellan in 1905, and her much-praised 1909 performance in <span class="italic">Madame X</span> by John N. Raphael. Ashwell was known as an actress of great soul, who chose to play what were then considered to be &#145;modern&#146; parts which demanded emotional force and sincerity. During this first phase of her career she worked with many of the iconic actor&#150;managers of the Victorian period and this was to influence the way in which her own career developed.<br>
<br>During the Edwardian period Ashwell took on the management of the Savoy Theatre in 1906 and then refurbished and reopened Penley's Theatre in Great Queen Street as the Kingsway in 1907. Her dedication to suffrage politics coincided with her years of actor management and it was the Kingsway which saw the first production of Cicely Hamilton's feminist play <span class="italic">Diana of Dobson's</span> (1908) with Ashwell in the lead. Ashwell later worked with Hamilton again as part of her work organizing entertainments for the troops during the First World War. At the Kingsway she encouraged among other things matin&eacute;e performances of new plays by new playwrights, and her wish to produce theatre which appealed to the mind meant that productions were not always commercially successful. Financial constraints eventually forced her into subletting the theatre to other managements. According to <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span> (13 February 1914):<blockquote>when the woman theatrical manager was practically unheard of she made a brilliant success of an enterprise that gave the public a series of plays in which the woman's point of view was never left out; and so she won another outpost for the advancing woman's army.</blockquote>Ashwell's political and ideological beliefs infiltrated her work to a significant degree during these years. Aware that her star status had come from playing either villainous or submissive women, she campaigned to improve women's lot in a theatre world largely controlled by men. Along with a number of other leading actresses she joined and became an active campaigner in the Actresses Franchise League in 1908. The league organized performances of suffrage plays and training in public speaking and generally acted as a pressure group which brought the struggle for female franchise more into the public eye, as well as aiming to improve generally the position of women within the theatre industry. For someone with such a high public profile Ashwell was unusually outspoken in her political beliefs, and was one of a deputation sent by the Women's Tax Resistance League to confront Lloyd George about the inequities of the income tax law for married women; she even refused at one point to condemn militant suffragette action, pointing out that such anarchy is often the &#145;result of some deep seated sore within the community&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 16 June 1914). Ashwell was also a founder of the Three Arts Club on the Marylebone Road in London: here affordable and safe accommodation was provided for women working in the arts.<br>
<br>A champion of theatrical causes as well as social ones, Ashwell spent a great deal of her career arguing for the benefits of some kind of national theatre, pointing out the continual discrepancies between attitudes to culture in other European countries and those in Britain. It was this agenda which underpinned her work from the First World War onwards; she believed in the educational and emotional value of theatre, that theatre should be available to all no matter where they lived or from what social class they originated. During the First World War she organized an enormous number of concerts for the troops, mainly in France, but some of the tours went as far afield as Egypt. These concerts might include short plays as well as songs and recitations or extracts from Shakespeare's works and were often oversubscribed by the troops eager to find respite from the terrors of the war. Ashwell worked with large teams of performers who were paid expenses only, and raised &pound;100,000 towards the enterprise. For this work she was appointed OBE in 1917.<br>
<br>After the First World War Ashwell returned to London and devoted her energies to trying to continue on home ground the kind of arts work she had been carrying out abroad. She set up touring companies which performed all over London, with the support of London county council mayors who gave permission for performances to take place in local halls and baths; they appeared as far afield as Camberwell, Enfield, Bethnal Green, and Watford. The Lena Ashwell Players became a training ground for many young performers who went on to later fame, and the repertory was full of both classic and modern works. In 1924 she established a permanent base at the Bijou, a small Notting Hill theatre which she renamed the Century. This was, until financial collapse in 1929, the headquarters of two companies, one in residence and one on tour, and such plays as St John Ervine's <span class="italic">Jane Clegg</span>, Henrik Ibsen's <span class="italic">The Master Builder</span> and <span class="italic">An Enemy of the People</span>, and G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Fanny's First Play</span> and <span class="italic">Misalliance</span>&#151;works unlikely to be staged in the commercialized West End theatres&#151;were produced to great critical acclaim.<br>
<br>With the collapse of the Century Theatre venture Ashwell retired from active service in the theatre. In one of her four books, <span class="italic">The Stage</span> (1929), she split her career into three phases, the first being her years as a star actress from which she made a great deal of money, the second her war work, which was honorary, and the third her work with the &#145;great London Boroughs&#146; in which she lost most of her money. To some extent she saw this work as having failed, but in retrospect it is not possible to see Ashwell as anything other than a pioneer of work toward a national theatre and as someone who truly dedicated herself to the opening up of opportunities for the whole community to enjoy theatre in one form or another.<br>
<br>Lena Ashwell's first husband was the actor Arthur Wyndham Playfair (1869&#150;1918). Unusually for her day, in 1908 she obtained a divorce from him on the grounds of drunken and violent behaviour towards her. In that year she married the surgeon Henry Simson, later knighted, and lived happily with him until his death in 1932. Her other works were <span class="italic">Modern Troubadours</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Reflections from Shakespeare</span> (1927), and <span class="italic">Myself a Player</span> (1936). She had no children and died on 13 March 1957 in London.<br>
