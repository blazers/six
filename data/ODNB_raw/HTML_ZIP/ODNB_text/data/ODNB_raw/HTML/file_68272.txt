<span class="headword">Carew,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1616), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is of uncertain origins, although he claimed connections with more famous and armigerous Carews, including George Carew, successively Lord Carew and earl of Totnes, with the Norfolk family of Gawdy, and with the lord of the manor at Bildeston, John Rivett, whose grandmother was a Carew. Still less is known of his education, but there is no evidence that he was a graduate, and in the Norwich consistory court he was described as &#145;unskillful and unlearned in the tongues, as Latin, Greek and Hebrew&#146;. He seems to have been ordained by Bishop Edmund Freake, either at Norwich or perhaps in Freake's original diocese of Rochester, which may tend to confirm naval connections, of which there are other stray hints.<br>
<br>Carew's career was that of a clerical stormy petrel in Essex and Suffolk. He is first encountered in the mid-1580s at Hatfield Peverel in Essex, this being a donative served by a curate, and as such at the disposal of the owner of the former priory, Edmund Allen. It is highly probable, though incapable of final proof, that the Essex curate was identical with the man who was later curate of St Margaret and St Nicholas, Ipswich, and rector of Bildeston, Suffolk. As a notorious nonconformist who never wore the surplice or used the sign of the cross in baptism, the circumstances of his appointment enabled Bishop John Aylmer (who was later said to have consented to it) to allege that Carew had been &#145;elected by the people&#146; and practised &#145;a presbytery&#146; although Carew's principal offence may have been the hard pastoral line he took with crypto-papists in the parish, &#145;adversaries&#146;, &#145;monstrous enemies&#146;, whom Aylmer was anxious to win  (Peel, 2.28&#150;35). Carew's verbal onslaught on Aylmer was extreme, and he suffered periods of imprisonment, interspersed with irregular preaching. After two years of ignoring the prayer book and promulgating presbyterian doctrine in two more donatives in Ipswich, his past caught up with him and he was again on the run. But Carew had powerful friends, including Sir Martin Frobisher, and also the third Lord Rich and Sir Robert Jermyn, who in 1591 secured the right of presentation to the relatively well-endowed Suffolk rectory of Bildeston from the earl of Essex.<br>
<br>At Bildeston, Carew either conformed or, more probably, found himself immune from prosecution for irregularities of that kind. His published sermons were, with one exception, typical and unremarkable Calvinist effusions, which freely plagiarized more celebrated preachers such as Richard Greenham and George Gifford. The exception was a sermon (part of a collection of <span class="italic">Certaine Godly and Necessarie Sermons</span>, 1603) to which he gave the title &#145;A caveat for craftesmen and clothiers&#146;. This was an outspoken attack on clothiers, remarkable less for its rhetoric, vivid though this was, than for Carew's deployment of apparently accurate facts and figures about hours of work and levels of pay in an industry in which the distinction between entrepreneurs and employees was already emergent. Clothiers were the most unconscionable of employers, &#145;considering the greatness, variety and continuance of their oppressions&#146;  (Carew, <span class="italic">Certaine Godly and Necessarie Sermons</span>, sig. T6<i>v</i>&#150;7<i>r</i>). &#145;It is a thing monstrous and strange that any should be so void of religion and humanity as to defraud the poor of their wages&#146;  (ibid., sig. T3<i>v</i>). Carew believed that the profits of rich clothiers were made from low and exploitative wages, &#145;the enriching of two or three in a town&#146;, &#145;the impoverishing of many&#146;  (ibid., sig. V6). Having been told that the rich remembered the poor in their wills, Carew remarked: &#145;Therefore it might be wished that such rich men would die quickly, that there might be some good done at their deaths, for they do hurt while they live&#146;  (ibid., sig. O5<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Although the economy of Bildeston depended on cloth, it is not certain that Carew's diatribe was delivered in his own parish or that he had his own people in his sights. The so-called &#145;new draperies&#146; predominated in Bildeston, and Carew alleged that things were more tolerable in that branch of the industry, reserving his harsher criticism for the &#145;blue men&#146;, the manufacturers of broadcloth. Certainly he continued to live, apparently peaceably, in his comfortable rectory until his death in 1616, when his will had nothing to say about the poor but expressed a concern that his widow should not be deprived of her interest in the tithe corn which was even then being harvested. Carew and his wife, Margaret (who had little to dispose of when she herself died in 1629), had no fewer than nine children, including a son George (perhaps named for Lord Carew), who entered Merton College, Oxford, in 1604 and became a London clergyman.<br>
