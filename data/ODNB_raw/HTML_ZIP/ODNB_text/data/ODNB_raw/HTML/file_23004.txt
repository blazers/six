<span class="headword">Rae,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1671&#150;1748), <span class="occ">printer and mechanic</span>, was born probably at Burronhill in the parish of Mouswald near Dumfries; his father's name was probably Peter Rae. In February 1692 he is recorded as a student in the class of Master John Law at Glasgow University, from which he graduated MA on 4 April 1694. He held three posts of clerkship in Dumfries before marrying, on 19 July 1697, Agnes Corsane. Matrimony encouraged him to seek a parish, and following trials and delays he was ordained as minister by the parish of Kirkbride near Sanquhar on 22 April 1703. By this date Rae had already shown his interest in matters mechanical. The hammermen (metalworkers) of Dumfries made him a freeman of the incorporation on 31 July 1702; his essay piece, possibly the first grandfather clock to have been manufactured in the south of Scotland, still survived in the 1990s, as did an astronomical chime clock he presented to the third duke of Queensberry in the 1730s.<br>
<br>Rae's ministry at Kirkbride involved constant strife with his parishioners, but he still managed to construct a printing press, only the seventh operating in Scotland at the time. The first recorded production was a broadside against the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> (1706), followed over the next fifteen years by at least eighteen further works ranging from religious tracts to chapbooks. <span class="italic">A History of the Late Rebellion</span> (1718), researched, written, and printed by Rae, is one of the main sources for the period. The <span class="italic">Dumfries Mercury</span> (1721), of which only the eighteenth and a portion of the twelfth numbers are known to survive, was the first newspaper in Scotland to be produced outside Edinburgh and Glasgow. A peculiarity of the press's productions was that Robert Rae was named as the printer. Robert, Peter's son, was eight years old when the press commenced operations, and although he later became involved with the family business (especially after 1714, when the press moved to Dumfries) it is likely that Peter used his son's name as a means of deflecting criticism within his parish. A hostile contemporary rhyme has no doubt of the printer's identity<blockquote>
<div>The printing trade he now does try<br>
</div>
<div>The Minister trade he should lay by.<br>
</div> (R. Ker, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1719)</blockquote>In 1721 Rae's wife, Agnes, inherited the extensive Corsane estates, and legal difficulties connected with the legacy persuaded him to cease printing. Nevertheless, other activities occupied this many-sided man. He was the agent at the Wanlockhead lead mines, surveyed the Lochar moss outside Dumfries, and in 1733 published his own sermon <span class="italic">Gospel Ministers Christ's Ambassadors</span>. Peter and Agnes had at least ten children; the surviving sons turned their father's hobbies into businesses, Robert as a printer, Alexander as a clockmaker in Dumfries, and James as agent at the lead mines and farmer. Rae was given the more substantial living of Kirkconnel parish in 1732, and in 1748 was awarded a timely tribute when he was elected moderator of Dumfries presbytery. He died at Kirkconnel manse on 29 December of that year, and was buried in Kirkconnel churchyard. <span class="italic">A Treatise of Lawful Oaths and Perjury</span> was published posthumously in 1749, and fragments of a manuscript history of Penpont presbytery survive.<br>
