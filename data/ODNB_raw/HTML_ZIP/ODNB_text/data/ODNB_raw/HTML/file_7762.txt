<span class="headword">Dodwell,  Edward</span>  (1776/7&#150;1832), <span class="occ">traveller and archaeologist</span>, was the son of Edward Dodwell (1747&#150;1828), of West Molesey, Surrey, and his wife, Frances (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jennings). Dodwell's sister, Frances (1771/2&#150;1857), was a watercolour painter who married the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6693/', "Sir Alexander Crichton (1763&#150;1856)")</script>; a younger brother, Harry, died in infancy about 1778. Dodwell was the grandson of Henry Dodwell, a London businessman, and his wife, Dulcabella. He was also the great-grandson of the prolific writer and theologian Henry Dodwell (1641&#150;1711), fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, who from 1688 to 1691 occupied the post of Camden professor of history at Oxford.<br>
<br>Dodwell was educated first at Parson's Green School, Middlesex, under Mr Waring, and second at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1798, and graduated BA in 1800. When young, he travelled in Scotland, Ireland, and England with his father and developed a taste for drawing buildings. Having private means he adopted no profession, though in 1823 he was described as &#145;a learned English architect&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1823). He is known to have resided for some time in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1801 Dodwell made a tour of Holland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. In April 1801 he arrived at Trieste to embark on his first tour of Greece; his &#145;intention was to visit Greece, to explore its antiquities, to compare its past with its present state, and to leave nothing unnoticed, which, to the classical reader, can be an object of interest, or a source of delight&#146;  (Dodwell, 1.1). On this journey, he was accompanied by his friend Sir William Gell (1777&#150;1836), who also travelled with Dodwell through Greece in 1805 and 1806. From Trieste he proceeded to Venice, and on 29 April 1801 set sail in the merchant ship <i>Lo Spirito Santo e la Nativit&agrave; della Madonna</i>, which was captained by Giovanni Marassi. Although this voyage was hampered by adverse weather conditions, by the end of May that year they had reached Corfu, where their passports were presented to Sir Speridion Foresti, the British consul-general. In June 1801 Dodwell travelled on to Ithaca, the island of Cephalonia, Patras, and through the provinces of Phocis and Boeotia, to Athens, and then on to the islands of the Greek archipelago, the coast of Troy, and Constantinople.<br>
<br>Dodwell's second tour of Greece began on 1 February 1805 when he departed from Messina with his artist, Signor Simone Pomardi, in the Greek merchant ship <i>Saint Speridion</i>. They landed at Z&aacute;kinthos, and after about a week proceeded on their journey to Mesol&oacute;ngion, Patras, Galaxidhion, and &Aacute;mfissa where they were met by Dr Andrea Cattani. Dodwell also visited the ruins at Delphi, Mount Parnassos, Lev&aacute;dhia, Thebes, and by about 26 March 1805 he had proceeded to Athens.<br>
<br>At Athens Dodwell was required to make a payment to the disdar, or Turkish governor, for the privilege of making drawings and observations of the Acropolis. Dodwell offered only part payment of the fee, with the promise of full payment on completion of his drawings. The disdar, however, demanded the whole sum, which Dodwell refused: in turn, he was banned from entering the Acropolis. However, on reaching the Acropolis, Dodwell procured his entrance by bribing the guards &#145;by throwing a few paras amongst them&#146;. Repeatedly visiting the Acropolis by this means, he &#145;acquired the name of the Frank of many Paras, and for a small expense purchased the civility of the soldiers&#146;  (Dodwell, 1.293). On a later occasion, while at the Parthenon, Dodwell attempted to explain his camera obscura to the disdar, who became perturbed and called Dodwell &#145;pig, devil, and Buonaparte&#146;, to which Dodwell replied that if he did not leave him unmolested, he would put him into his box (camera obscura). Apparently, the disdar did not trouble him again.<br>
<br>From Athens, Dodwell journeyed out to the Attic Mountains, visiting Aegina, Piraeus, Thessal&iacute;a, Chaeroneia and Orchomenos, Eleusis, and (about 30 November 1805) Corinth. Near Corinth, at the village of Mertese, he persuaded local villagers to open sepulchres a quarter of a mile from their village. A number of bones, vases, and an urn containing burnt remains, were extracted from these tombs; in addition he was informed by the villagers &#145;that a Jew of Corinth, who had lately been digging in this spot, had found several vases&#146;  (Dodwell, 2.197). On visiting this person, Dodwell found and procured an inscribed vase, the lid of which depicted a wild-boar chase, with the names of the actors written beside each painted human figure. This vase, referred to now as the &#145;Dodwell vase&#146; or &#145;Dodwell pyxis&#146;, was one of a group of vases of Middle Corinthian oriental style now attributed to the &#145;Dodwell painter&#146;, who specialized in decorating vases with friezes of animals.<br>
<br>After leaving Corinth, Dodwell also travelled across the Peloponnese, visiting Mycenae, Tiryns, Ep&iacute;davros, Messene, Megalopolis, and Sparta. On 2 April 1806 he left Patras for Mesol&oacute;ngion, and a week later set out for Ithaca. Dodwell made a prolonged stay at Corfu until 16 May 1806 when he set sail for Messina in a Russian armed brig, <i>Letun</i>. At Messina he met his acquaintance Mr Mackenzie, and on 12 August 1806 sailed in the merchant vessel <i>Il Redivivo</i> to Civita Vecchia (which had been taken by the French some weeks before). Dodwell's ship next sailed for Leghorn where the passengers had to undergo a quarantine of twenty-one days. As a former prisoner of Bonaparte's government, Dodwell felt obliged (according to the terms of his parole) to surrender himself to the French; and his two years' leave of absence to quit France (to make his tour of Greece) had expired. Therefore, following quarantine, he disembarked and visited the French general at Civita Vecchia. He was indebted to the artists Granet and Paulin du Quelar, Count Annoni of Milan, the sculptor Dupaty, and the author Lechevalier, whose exertions secured permission for him, first, to travel in Greece and, second, to surrender himself at Rome, rather than Verdun. On 18 September 1806 Dodwell arrived at Rome. In this latter city and in Naples, he reportedly resided almost continuously for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Dodwell spent two years examining Cyclopean buildings, making drawings of the walls of the cities of Argos, Tyrinthia, and Lycosurae and compared them with similar monuments in Italy. The most important of these drawings was considered to be that of Lycosurae, the ancient city of Arcadia, which was apparently discovered by Dodwell in 1805. In Greece, Dodwell also made some four hundred drawings, while his artist, Pomardi, made about six hundred. Dodwell also collected numerous coins in Greece, and during his lifetime formed an impressive collection of classical antiquities (see Braun, <span class="italic">Notice sur le Mus&eacute;e Dodwell</span>, 1837), including 115 bronzes and 143 vases. He sold the remarkable bronze reliefs from Perugia and an archaic head of a warrior to the crown prince of Bavaria. The location of a marble head from the west pediment of the Parthenon, once in his possession, is now unknown.<br>
<br>Dodwell's publications included: <span class="italic">Alcuni bassi rilievi della Grecia descritti e pubblicati in viii tavole</span> (1812); <span class="italic">A Classical and Topographical Tour through Greece; during the Years 1801, 1805 and 1806</span> (2 vols., 1819), with a German translation by F. K. L. Sickler (1821&#150;2); <span class="italic">Views in Greece, from Drawings by E. Dodwell</span>, with descriptions in English and French (1821); and <span class="italic">Views and descriptions of Cyclopian or Pelasgic remains in Greece and Italy &hellip; from drawings by E. D.</span> (1834), which was also printed with French text and title in the same year.<br>
<br>In 1816 Dodwell was elected an honorary member of the Royal Academy in Berlin, along with his friend Gell. Dodwell married late in life Theresa, the daughter of Count Giraud; she was at least twenty years his junior. There were no children from this marriage. His wife was described by Lady Blessington as &#145;one of the most faultless models of loveliness ever beheld&#146;  (Madden, 427); and when Moore saw Theresa Dodwell in society at Rome (October 1819), he remarked &#145;that beautiful creature, Mrs. Dodwell &hellip; her husband used to be a great favourite with the pope, who always called him &#147;Caro Doodle&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Dodwell died at Rome on 13 May 1832 from the effects of an illness contracted in 1830 when exploring the Sabine Mountains near Rome.<br>
<br>Dodwell was survived by his wife who married, second, in 1833, Count de Spaur, the Bavarian minister at Rome. She was responsible for organizing the pope's escape from the Vatican to Gaeta during the revolution of 1848. Gell, who acted as a trustee of Dodwell's estate, considered his friend's will most unjust towards Theresa, his widow. He left her just 12,500 scudi and, while the leased house and furniture also went to her, at the time it was doubtful whether she would inherit his museum and books. However, family records suggest that she did indeed acquire his collections of Greek, Roman, and other artefacts, including the Dodwell vase, which were later sold. The Dodwell vase, for example, now resides in the Staatliche Antikensammlungen und Glyptothek, Munich. Dodwell's sister, Lady Frances Crichton, who also survived him, inherited his Irish land.<br>
