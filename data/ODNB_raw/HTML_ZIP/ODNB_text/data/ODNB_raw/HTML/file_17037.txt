<span class="headword">Loutherbourg,  Philippe Jacques <span class="st"> [Philip James]</span>  de</span>  (1740&#150;1812), <span class="occ">landscape painter and scene designer</span>, was born on 31 October 1740 according to the baptismal register of the Neue Kirche in Strasbourg, Alsace. However, his monument in the cemetery of St Nicholas in Chiswick, London, notes his birth as taking place on 1 November in Fulda, some 60 miles north of Darmstadt, Germany. His mother was Catherine Barbe Heitz and his father Philippe Jacques (or Jacob) Loutherbourg (1698&#150;1768), who worked as a miniaturist and engraver to the court of Darmstadt. The painter Johann Rudolf Loutherbourg (1652&#150;1727), noted by B&eacute;n&eacute;zit as working in Basel, is likely to have been the artist's grandfather. His father planned an engineering career for his son, while his mother held hopes for his future in the ministry of the Lutheran church. He studied mathematics, theology, and languages at the University of Strasbourg, but a talent for drawing led him to seek instruction from his father. On the family's move to Paris in 1755, he began his formal artistic training with Carle Van Loo, rector of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale. He studied engraving with Jean-Georges Wille and began his lifelong concern for the chemistry and technology of pictorial reproduction. While still a pupil of Wille, Loutherbourg worked in the studio of Fran&ccedil;ois Joseph Casanova, and exhibited his first paintings at the salon, in 1763. Critical acclaim was swift, and Diderot identified the abilities to depict space and atmosphere that were to become distinctive features of de Loutherbourg's work, both in the theatre and for the easel  (D. Diderot, <span class="italic">Salons</span>, ed. J. Seznec and J. Adh&eacute;mar, 2nd edn; 1975, 1.225).<br>
<br>Loutherbourg regularly exhibited in subsequent salons and, in 1766, he was nominated as a &#145;peintre du roy&#146; of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale. In the following year he was elected a full member&#151;a mark of his celebrity in that he was three years away from the qualifying age of thirty. He was now unhappily living with Barbe Burlat, whom he had married in 1764. But rumours of criminal activity on her part sufficiently tainted the painter's name to prevent the final bestowal of the Acad&eacute;mie award. His father died in 1768, and it was perhaps a combination of personal reasons (as well as artistic imperatives) that caused Loutherbourg to leave Paris that year. Significantly, he chose to make his grand tour to southern France, Switzerland, and the Rhineland, and not to Venice, Naples, and Rome. By 1771 he was the most prolific painter exhibiting at the salon. He adopted the &#145;de&#146; and used this almost exclusively with his name thereafter.<br>
<br>It is possible that de Loutherbourg considered his journey to England in the autumn of 1771 as a continuation of his tour of Europe, and not with a view to permanent residence. Although there is no direct evidence of theatrical activity in Paris, de Loutherbourg's letter of introduction was from Jean Monnet (1703&#150;1785), the retired manager of the Op&eacute;ra Comique, and a friend of David Garrick, who was patron to a number of easel artists, including Zoffany, Gainsborough, and Richard Wilson. On arrival in London, de Loutherbourg stayed with Domenico Angelo, a fencing-master, stage machinist, and good friend of both Monnet and Garrick. It was here, according to Henry, Domenico's son, that de Loutherbourg met Garrick.<br>
<br>The result of this meeting was de Loutherbourg's letter to Garrick that proposed radical change to the scenic arrangements at Drury Lane Theatre (Harvard Theatre Collection). Garrick was sufficiently impressed to engage de Loutherbourg and to give him control over all aspects of the scenic department at Drury Lane. He was paid an unprecedented salary of &pound;300, which was increased to &pound;500 during his second season for Garrick.<br>
<br>De Loutherbourg's most significant designs were for Garrick's pantomime <span class="italic">A Christmas Tale</span> (1773); Alexander Dow's tragedy <span class="italic">Sethona</span> (1774); John Burgoyne's comedy <span class="italic">The Maid of Oaks</span> (1774); Henry Woodward's pantomime <span class="italic">Queen Mab</span> (1775); and Charles Dibdin's ballad opera <span class="italic">The Waterman</span> (1776). Contemporary comment valued his work for the unification of all scenic elements; for his skill in creating lighting effects of considerable sophistication; and for his ability to create scenes of great topographic power and association.<br>
<br>Sheridan continued to employ de Loutherbourg when he took over the management of Drury Lane in 1776. New work included Sheridan's afterpiece <span class="italic">The Camp</span> (1778), which was noted for its representation of the military camp at Cox-Heath and in which reference is made to de Loutherbourg as &#145;Mr Leatherbag the great painter&#146;. Sheridan's comedy <span class="italic">The Critic</span> (1779) presented de Loutherbourg's recreation of Tilbury Fort and battle against the Armada for which &#145;The deception of the sea was very strong, and the perspective of the ships, together with the mode of their sailing truly picturesque&#146;  (<span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>, 1 Nov 1779). The harlequinade&#150;travelogue written by Sheridan and de Loutherbourg, <span class="italic">The Wonders of Derbyshire</span> (1779), for which a model survives in the Theatre Museum, London, may well have been his finest work in this period. The scenographic coherence of this is probably rare, and Sheridan increasingly economized by extracting scenic effects from earlier work, or requiring de Loutherbourg to design a spectacular scene to rejuvenate revived pieces&#151;for example the revival in 1780 of Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>, concluded with &#145;a Grand View of Greenwich Hospital&#146;.<br>
<br>Sheridan's financial mismanagement may well have prompted de Loutherbourg to leave Drury Lane after completing <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> in 1781. Additionally, de Loutherbourg was elected a member of the Royal Academy early in 1781 and the next decade saw him committed to pursuing his easel career. He undertook extensive tours of the Peak District of Derbyshire, the Lake District, and north Wales, and exhibited some twenty-one paintings between 1784 and 1787. Some of his most powerful and typical landscapes include: <span class="italic">Dovedale in Derbyshire</span> (exh. RA, 1784; York City Art Gallery), <span class="italic">View of Snowdon from Llan Berris Lake</span> (exh. RA, 1787; Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-arts, Strasbourg), and <span class="italic">Smugglers Landing in a Storm</span> (1791, Victoria Art Gallery, Bath).<br>
<br>De Loutherbourg made two important interventions in matters theatrical during the 1780s. In 1782, at his home in Lisle Street, London, he presented his actor-less miniature theatre, the Eidophusikon, which presented scenes from Milton; topographical scenes that prefigured the great panoramas and dioramas of the nineteenth century; and scenes of immediate interest such as the loss at sea in January 1786 of the Indiaman <i>Halsewell</i>. De Loutherbourg perhaps achieved the visual unity and compositional control in miniature that current theatre technology was unable, or unwilling, to allow.<br>
<br>With John O'Keefe, de Loutherbourg prepared the pantomime <span class="italic">Omai, or, A Trip Round the World</span> (1785) at Covent Garden Theatre. This built upon the excitement created by Captain Cook's voyages in the south seas. John Webber, the artist who accompanied Cook, assisted and added authority to the scenic spectacle. Two models survive in the Theatre Museum, London, and seventeen costume designs exist in the Commonwealth National Library, Canberra, Australia.<br>
<br>In 1781 de Loutherbourg transformed rooms at Fonthill Abbey, Wiltshire, into an environment of Arabian fantasy for William Beckford, and concerns with alchemy, mysticism, and the occult underlie his later career. In 1787 he left England with the notorious theologian and freemason Count Cagliostro. Their partnership ended acrimoniously and de Loutherbourg and his wife, Lucy, returned to London to offer faith-healing services through &#145;heavenly and divine Influx&#146;. He abandoned this in late 1789 and returned to his easel. During the 1790s he celebrated Britain's growing naval eminence in <span class="italic">Lord Howe's Action, or, The Glorious First of June</span> (1795; NMM), <span class="italic">The Battle of Camperdown</span> (1797) and <span class="italic">The Battle of the Nile</span> (1800; both Tate collection). Robert Bowyer published William Pickett's engravings of de Loutherbourg's <span class="italic">The Picturesque Scenery of Great Britain</span> (1801) and <span class="italic">The Romantic and Picturesque Scenery of England and Wales</span> (1805). He contributed many of the plates in Thomas Macklin's <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1800) and to Robert Bowyer's <span class="italic">History of England</span> (1812). In 1807 he was made &#145;Historical painter to HRH the Duke of Gloucester&#146;, but no paintings have been identified from this appointment. He died peacefully at his home in Hammersmith, Middlesex, on 11 March 1812, and was buried at St Nicholas's Church, Chiswick, where his second wife, Lucy, who died in 1828, and his son, William Philip James Lodder (1779&#150;1867), were also interred.<br>
