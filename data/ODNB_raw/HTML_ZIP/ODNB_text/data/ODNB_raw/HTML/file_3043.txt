<span class="headword">Bower,  Archibald</span>  (1686<span class="mult">x</span>8&#150;1766), <span class="occ">religious controversialist and historical writer</span>, was born either on 17 January 1686 or on 17 January 1687 or in September 1688, at or near Dundee. His parents' names are unknown. According to his own account he was descended from an ancient family that had for several hundred years been possessed of an estate in Forfarshire, but as the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> remarks &#145;all his statements concerning himself must be received with extreme caution&#146;.<h2>
<a name="TheSocietyofJesus"></a>The Society of Jesus</h2>In October 1702 Bower was sent to the Scots College at Douai before going on to Rome, where he entered the Society of Jesus on 9 December 1706. After two years of novitiate and of attending lectures in philosophy at the Roman College he was appointed to teach at the Jesuit colleges at Fano (1712&#150;13) and Fermo (1714&#150;16). From 1717 to 1721 he studied theology at the Roman College, during which time he was ordained, in 1719 or 1720. He was then sent to lecture in philosophy at Arezzo in 1721, at Macerata in 1723, and at Perugia in 1725. He was professed at Florence on 2 February 1723.<br>
<br>In 1726 Bower left Perugia for reasons that are less than clear. Those whom he later considered to be his enemies alleged that he had been discovered in a love affair with a nun. He himself described how he escaped from Perugia on account of &#145;the hellish proceedings&#146; of the inquisition in which, he said, he was a consultor, or judge. In fact the Jesuit records show that he was sent away to England in 1726, perhaps with the hope of enabling him to make a fresh start; if he was truly penitent he could have continued as a Jesuit. He arrived in England in July 1726. The Jesuit records show that as late as 1729 he was in London, nominally as a member of the Jesuit mission to Scotland. To begin with he was in touch with fellow Jesuits but by November 1726 he had abandoned the Jesuits and the Catholic church. Two accounts of his &#145;flight&#146; from Perugia were published, one by Richard Baron&#151;<span class="italic">A faithful account of Mr Archibald Bower's motives for leaving his office of secretary to the court of inquisition</span> (1750)&#151;the other by Bower himself, <span class="italic">Mr Bower's Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet</span> (1757).<h2>
<a name="Conversion"></a>Conversion?</h2>In England Bower made the acquaintance of Dr Edward Aspinwall, a former Jesuit who was at that time prebendary of Westminster and who introduced him to Dr Samuel Clarke; he also met George Berkeley, dean of Londonderry and later bishop of Cloyne. He said that he found a system of religion for himself and was for six years a protestant of no particular denomination. Eventually he conformed to the Church of England. To earn his living he taught the classics and Italian to students, and read the classics with Lord Aylmer, former MP and equerry to George I, to whom he had been introduced by Dr Thomas Goodman, the king's physician. Aylmer in turn introduced Bower to George Lyttelton, who proved to be a steadfast friend when almost everybody else had deserted him. For a year he undertook the education of the son of Mr Thompson of Cooley, in Berkshire, but after a period of ill health he was again employed by Lord Aylmer, this time as tutor to two of his children.<br>
<br>While Bower was living in Aylmer's household he wrote the monthly review <span class="italic">Historia Litteraria, or, An exact and early account of the most valuable books published in the several parts of Europe</span> which was published from 1730 to 1734. From 1735 to 1744 he was employed by a consortium of London booksellers that was undertaking an ambitious and costly project to publish in monthly instalments a history of the world. One of a group of writers engaged on the history that included George Sale and George Psalmanazar, Bower's contribution to <span class="italic">An Universal History, from the Earliest Account of Time to the Present</span> was the history of ancient Rome, which came to occupy one third of the seven folio volumes that dealt with ancient history. The final volume of the ancient history appeared in 1744 and the modern history was not completed until 1765; in the interim an octavo edition had appeared and the work had been translated into French, Italian, and German. Bower received &pound;300 for revising the second edition of the <span class="italic">Universal History</span> but he apparently undertook the task in &#145;a slovenly and careless manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Despite such failings the <span class="italic">Universal History</span> was a celebrated publishing enterprise that was widely read throughout Europe. Its significance is amply demonstrated by the fact that the writers of the <span class="italic">Encyclop&eacute;die</span> drew on many of its articles in preparing the entries for that publication.<br>
<br>Letters to Jesuits in London from their superior-general in Rome between March 1730 and February 1734 reveal that Bower during these years was nibbling at the idea of returning to the Catholic church and to the Society of Jesus. Then, in 1744, he met the Jesuit Philip Carteret, who in 1745 reconciled him to the church and readmitted him to the society. It was understood that he would go into the country, be provided with books by the Jesuits, and devote himself to writing. A few years before this, wishing to invest his savings (&pound;1100) rather than leave them in the funds and not being able to persuade any of his protestant friends to burden his estate with a life-rent or to find another form of investment, he had transferred his money through Mr Wright, a Catholic banker, to a Mr Hill. Hill was in fact John Hill, the financial agent of the English Jesuits, who gave him for his &pound;1100 (with a further &pound;250) a generous 7 per cent, that is to say &pound;94 10<i>s</i>. a year. This financial negotiation later proved very damaging to his reputation. His opponents believed that he made this arrangement to recommend himself to his superiors and to prove his sincerity. But Bower did not break with his protestant friends, and in 1745 he was engaged in a treaty of marriage that in fact did not take place. He decided to break his vows a second time, and corresponded with Henry Sheldon, provincial superior of the Jesuits in England, asking for the return of his money, which he duly received on 20 June 1747. At St Benet Paul's Wharf, London, on 20 August 1749 Bower married Dorothy Conner, the daughter of a Church of England clergyman and a niece of Bishop William Nicolson. A widow, she brought Bower a fortune of &pound;4000 and a child from her former marriage.<h2>
<a name="HistoryofthePopes"></a>History of the Popes</h2>In March 1747 Bower issued proposals for printing by subscription <span class="italic">History of the Popes</span> &#145;by Archibald Bower Esq., heretofore public professor of rhetoric, history and philosophy in the universities of Rome, Fermo and Macerata&#146;&#151;a violent attack on papal supremacy &#145;well qualified to serve the interests of Protestantism&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 60/2). He announced that he had begun the work to support the doctrine of papal supremacy but that his researches had led him to change his mind on the subject. In 1748 he presented the first volume to George II, and through the influence of Lyttelton, a commissioner of the Treasury and a friend of the prime minister, Henry Pelham, was appointed keeper of Queen Caroline's library and, in 1754, clerk of the buck-warrants, &#145;an office of no great emolument&#146;  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 25.261). The second volume (with a lengthy list of subscribers) and the third appeared in 1750 and 1754, respectively, the fourth in 1759. The final three volumes were rushed through the press in the 1760s, and the recent history of the popes covered in a superficial manner: the period 1600 to 1758 occupied a mere twenty-six pages of the seven volumes. To the fifth volume Bower attached an appendix of 180 pages: &#145;A summary view of the controversy between the papists and the author &hellip; the cruel and unjust persecution which the author of the present history has undergone, in this protestant kingdom, from the Jesuits, encouraged and aided by a protestant clergyman, and the wicked measures, which they have jointly pursued to force him back to the idolatrous church and antichristian order he had left&#146;.<h2>
<a name="TheSheldonletters"></a>The Sheldon letters</h2>The first serious attack on the <span class="italic">History of the Popes</span> was made in a pamphlet by the Revd Alban Butler published anonymously at Douai under the title <span class="italic">Remarks on the two first volumes of the late lives of the popes, in letters from a gentleman to a friend in the country</span> (1754), which exposed in 100 pages the author's plagiarism and literary ill faith. This may have had little effect, but about 1750 there had come into the hands of Sir Henry Bedingfield, a Catholic, the letters that Bower had written, signed A&#151;D B&#151;R, to Sheldon during the period of his last coquetting with Catholicism. These letters were written about the time when the prospectus for the <span class="italic">History of the Popes</span> was issued. While in the prospectus Bower posed as one who had fervent zeal for the protestant faith and was about to publish the results of twenty years of hostile criticism of the papacy, he was writing confidential and respectful letters to Sheldon about the return of his money. Bower maintained that the letters were forgeries designed to destroy his reputation with his protestant friends and produced by the Jesuits in revenge for his attack on the frauds of the priesthood.<br>
<br>One of those who believed the letters were genuine was David Garrick, who had been Bower's friend, and he informed Lyttelton (who took no action) of his belief. Later Garrick threatened to write a farce in which Bower would be introduced as a mock convert and the profligacy of his character exposed. Another who saw the letters was the writer Nathaniel Hooke, who talked of the matter with John Douglas, chaplain to Lord Bath and afterwards bishop of Salisbury, who had already detected the fraud of William Lauder in regard to Milton. Douglas met the historian Dr Thomas Birch, who knew Bower's hand, and he and one Morgan, who had a portfolio of Bower's writings, became convinced, with Douglas, in February 1756 that the letters were genuine.<br>
<br>Sir Henry Bedingfield defied Bower to bring the matter to public trial but Bower replied by asserting that the letters were forgeries and declared that he had had no intercourse with the Jesuits for thirty years; in June he issued a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Mr Bower's Affidavit in Answer to the False Accusation Brought Against him by Papists</span>. The reply by Douglas, published in the same month, was <span class="italic">Six letters from A&#151;d B&#151;r to Father Sheldon, provincial of the Jesuits in England; illustrating with several remarkable facts tending to ascertain the authenticity of the said letters and the true character of the writer</span>. Douglas found that the letters revealed that in the summer of 1746 and in early 1747, after Bower had been readmitted by the Jesuits, he was writing to Sheldon on matters arising from his return to the society and asking for &pound;500 to pay to a woman for what was later found to be breach of promise. Douglas's tract was a powerful denunciation of Bower and proved the letters were genuine; it showed that want of veracity was not the only defect in Bower's character and that he was as little remarkable for his probity as for his love of truth. He was plainly trading, under false pretences, on the respect of protestants for him and his writings. Douglas also drew attention to the evidence of Mrs Hoyles, a lady converted to Roman Catholicism by Bower years earlier. Her evidence made it clear that Bower was ready to support in secret the church that, for self-interested ends, he was publicly denouncing.<h2>
<a name="Ashatteredreputation"></a>A shattered reputation</h2>Bower replied to Douglas with his <span class="italic">Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet Intituled &#145;Six Letters from A&#151;d B&#151;r to Father Sheldon&#146;</span>, published in two parts, in January and February 1757, respectively, arguing that the Jesuits had asked for his money and that he had agreed because he thought that they were good business people. &#145;Fancy&#146;, said Douglas, &#145;a deserter from Catholicism, a fugitive from his Order depositing his money with the Jesuit Provincial, that is with the representative of all that he had flouted and injured&#146;  (Pollen, 301), whereupon he wrote a second pamphlet, <span class="italic">Bower and Tillemont Compared</span> (1757), showing how the <span class="italic">History of the Popes</span>&#151;the first volume especially&#151;was chiefly a translation of a work of the French historian S&eacute;bastien Le Nain de Tillemont. Douglas added &#145;some further Particulars relating to the true character and conduct of the Translator&#146;. In his reply to <span class="italic">Bower and Tillemont Compared</span> and in two other pamphlets Bower attempted in 1757 to refute the criticism of his character made by Douglas, who in return published <span class="italic">A Full Confutation of All the Facts Advanced in Mr Bower's Three Defences</span>, which drew from Bower <span class="italic">Mr Bower's Reply to a Scurrilous Tract Intituled A Full Confutation</span> (1757). Douglas then wrote <span class="italic">A Complete and Final Detection of A&#151;d B&#151;r</span> (February 1758), to which Bower made no reply.<br>
<br>During his life and after his death there were many who approved of Bower's writings; his views were acceptable to a section of public opinion at that time. In his last years he continued his attacks on his enemies and his attempt to recover his reputation. He published the last volumes of <span class="italic">History of the Popes</span>, and in 1757 brought out an abridgement of the first four volumes in French. He died on 3 September 1766, probably in London, and was buried in Marylebone churchyard. His widow, to whom he left all his property, wrote from Woodstock Street on 10 October 1766 that during the seventeen years that she had constantly been with him he had always professed himself a protestant. The epitaph on his tomb described him as a man exemplary for every social virtue, justly esteemed by all who knew him for his strict honesty and integrity, a faithful friend, and a sincere Christian.<br>
