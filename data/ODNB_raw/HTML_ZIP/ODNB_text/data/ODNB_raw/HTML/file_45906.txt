<span class="headword">Bax,  Ernest Belfort</span>  (1854&#150;1926), <span class="occ">Marxist theoretician and activist</span>, was born at his parents' home, 27 Clarendon Square, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 23 July 1854, the last of four children of Daniel Bax (<i>d</i>. 1882), a manufacturer, and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of John Carter of Greenwich. His parents were strict nonconformists who followed evangelical and sabbatarian principles. The family moved to Brighton shortly after his birth, and remained there until 1864, when they moved to Hampstead. Educated mainly by private tutors, Bax began to rebel against his comfortable and pious bourgeois background early. At the age of sixteen he identified himself with the &#145;Communards&#146; in Paris as they struggled to erect a new social order amid the military collapse of France. This sympathy drew him to the London positivists, one of the few groups in England to favour the revolutionaries in Paris. Although he did not join the positivists, their vision of a new religion centring on the ideal of humanity, derived from Auguste Comte, strongly influenced Bax.<br>
<br>In 1875 Bax travelled to Germany to study musical composition at the Stuttgart conservatory. After a year he abandoned the plan, although he remained sufficiently conversant with musical forms to serve as a music critic for the London <span class="italic">Star</span> in the 1880s, a position he passed on to his close friend George Bernard Shaw. The hope of becoming a composer would be realized by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30645/', "Arnold Bax")</script>. During the 1880s and early 1890s he earned his living by journalism, supplemented after 1882 by his father's inheritance. But in 1894 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple and commenced practice as a barrister. He did not abandon journalism, editing the socialist journals <span class="italic">Time</span> and <span class="italic">Today</span> and continuing to write copiously on philosophy and socialism.<br>
<br>In 1879, while he was working as a correspondent for the <span class="italic">London Standard</span> in Berlin, Bax's acquaintance with the German philosopher Edward von Hartmann had led to a lifelong interest in philosophical questions. A decisive turn to his thought came when he read Marx's <span class="italic">Kapital</span>. His short piece on Marxist theory, published in 1881, won Bax the praise and gratitude of Marx. Bax did not, however, adopt the orthodox Marxist standpoint, fixed in the years just ahead by the strictly materialistic and deterministic version of Engels. Marxism, according to Bax, still required philosophy, which he defined as &#145;the final pronouncements of thought on the great problems of life&#146;  (E. B. Bax, <span class="italic">Outlooks from the New Standpoint</span>, 1891, 196). Over the next two decades he attempted to develop the ethical, religious, and metaphysical meaning of socialism by drawing on the German philosophical tradition. From Kant he drew insight into man's ethical life, while Hegel provided a dialectical logic which swept away &#145;all accepted habits of thought&#146; and disclosed the dynamic nature of reality. But Bax rejected Hegel's rationalism in favour of a notion found in Schopenhauer and von Hartmann, of a non-rational impulse beneath consciousness. Bax called this impulse the &#145;alogical&#146;. It remained fundamental to his thought.<br>
<br>Bax accepted Marx's analysis of capitalism. But he was occupied mainly with changes in human consciousness and denied that moral and aesthetic principles evolved in subordination to economic causes. By means of his metaphysical augmentation of Marxist materialism Bax developed a view of history according to which humankind was moving from the unconscious social solidarity of primitive societies, through a period of private property, individualism, and the class struggle, toward the future solidarity consciousness of communism. Scattered through his writings were speculations that humanity was developing a &#145;super organic&#146; consciousness in which the tension-ridden personality characteristic of history would be overcome. Although Bax never produced a general interpretation of history, he wrote three books dealing with the French Revolution and published three studies of the Reformation era in Germany.<br>
<br>Bax attempted to instruct his socialist colleagues in the larger meaning of their cause. In 1882 he joined the Democratic Federation (later Social Democratic Federation), founded a year earlier by Henry Mayers Hyndman, and moving toward a Marxist political programme. Two years later Bax joined William Morris in breaking with Hyndman to form the Socialist League. Both men rejected Hyndman's utilitarian-oriented Marxism in favour of a conception of socialism which emphasized ethical and aesthetic values. Bax and Morris worked closely together, editing the league's journal, <span class="italic">The Commonweal</span>, and collaborating on a book, <span class="italic">Socialism and the Ground up</span>, which combined a straightforward account of Marxist economic theory with the utopian vision of the authors. The daughter of Morris described their relationship:<blockquote>A strange pair they made, Bax with his fine, regular features and bushy moustache &hellip; tall and thin, in his black coat &hellip; smoking with perhaps a glass at his elbow; my father &hellip; sitting at the writing table &hellip; with perhaps a dry grin on his face at a vagary of Bax's. (M. Morris, <span class="italic">William Morris</span>, 2, 1936, 173)</blockquote>In 1889 Bax left the Socialist League, now the scene of a bitter conflict between those, including Bax, who favoured political action, and a quasi-anarchist wing. He returned to Hyndman's Social Democratic Federation, convinced that it offered the best hope of holding the practical and ideal sides of the movement together. In the years ahead Bax served on the federation's executive, edited its journal, <span class="italic">Justice</span>, for a short time, and remained one of Hyndman's closest associates. He devoted himself to what he saw as the higher meaning of Marxism, firmly committed to its international mission, and battling against those social democrats who played down the revolutionary goal in order to enhance their appeal to the workers. Toward those socialists who developed, in the Independent Labour Party, a popular ethically inspired form of socialism, Bax had only contempt. Their sentimental socialism was a &#145;bastard enthusiasm &hellip; born of the morbid self consciousness of our Christian and middle class civilization run to seed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Religion of Socialism</span>, 1885, 100). He strongly opposed the tendency among some socialists to assert the compatibility of Christianity and socialism. Although he became less active in the movement after the turn of the century, Bax continued to be seen by Hyndman as the &#145;only original thinker now in any country&#146;  (H. M. Hyndman to George Bernard Shaw, 2 Jan 1914, BL, Shaw MSS) capable of formulating a new philosophical synthesis.<br>
<br>Bax's role in the early British socialist movement was, however, idiosyncratic. This was most evident in the social criticism to which he devoted much of his journalistic activity. He attacked many features of British life&#151;imperialism, the legal system, and particularly the middle-class family, &#145;the most perfect specimen of the complete sham that history has presented&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Religion of Socialism</span>, 1885, 141). In contrast to nearly all of his socialist colleagues, Bax was convinced that prevailing moral and legal conventions permitted the female to dominate the male. He fiercely opposed the contemporary feminist movement. Although Bax looked to the working class as the bearer of the &#145;religion of socialism&#146;, his manner&#151;abstract and impractical&#151;foreclosed any popular appeal. A young Glasgow socialist, Edwin Muir, recalled hearing him &#145;mumble his way through a long and intricate paper on some aspect of historical determinism, never raising his eyes from the bundle of papers he held before him&#146;  (E. Muir, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1954, 112).<br>
<br>Even so, Bax was an interesting figure in the development of modern socialism. His attempt to do justice to the complexities of human consciousness anticipated later Marxists who broke with the rigid materialism and determinism of orthodoxy. He remained, however, a late Victorian; his socialist faith was a solution to the crisis of religious belief which occupied so many of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>Bax was married twice. His first wife, Emily Gordon Wright, whom he married in 1877, died at the age of thirty-six after bearing seven children. In 1897 he married a German woman, Maria Johanna Cecelia Henneberg. He died within hours of his second wife at 204 Bedford Hill, Balham, London, on 26 November 1926.<br>
