<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cleland,  William Paton <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">cardiothoracic surgeon</span>, was born on 30 May 1912 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the only son and third of five children of Sir John Burton Cleland (1878&#150;1971), pathologist and naturalist, and his wife, Dora Isabel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Paton. His father became professor of pathology at the University of Adelaide in 1920 and his dedication to the environment was recognized by the naming of Cleland Conservation Park in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. The Cleland family had been involved in law, viticulture, and medicine in Australia since 1852.<br>
<br>Cleland was educated at Scotch College and graduated in medicine from the University of Adelaide in 1934. After junior appointments at the Royal Adelaide Hospital he worked his way as a ship's doctor to England at the age of twenty-seven in order to specialize as a physician in chest medicine. He gained a post at the Brompton Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, from where he obtained membership of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1939 (becoming a fellow in 1967). But encouraged by the senior surgeon, Tudor Edwards, who thought that he would make a good surgeon, he then became the resident surgical officer at the Brompton. His mother did not approve, commenting, &#145;Bill was never any good at carpentry&#146;. Cleland was later to say, &#145;Little did mother know that cardio-thoracic surgery owes more to plumbing than to carpentry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Courier Mail</span>, 4 May 2005). During the Second World War he served in the Emergency Medical Service at the Horton Hospital, Epsom, where he operated on both military and civilian patients, removing bomb fragments from the heart and lungs and also operating for pulmonary tuberculosis. Meanwhile on 18 May 1940, at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Hampstead, he married Norah Goodhart (1914&#150;1994), daughter of George Elijah Goodhart, a stockbroker. They had a daughter, Janet, and two sons, Peter and John.<br>
<br>In 1946 Cleland became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and started out on his lifetime's work as a consultant cardiothoracic surgeon, gaining appointments concurrently at King's College Hospital and the Brompton Hospital (from 1948) and Hammersmith Hospital, at the Postgraduate Medical School of London (from 1949). The appointment at Hammersmith was to prove the highlight of his surgical career. He also served as civilian consultant to the Royal Navy and adviser in thoracic surgery to the Department of Health and Social Security.<br>
<br>Cardiac surgery developed rapidly after 1945 when the first &#145;blue baby&#146; operation was carried out in America, but such operations were all done with an intact beating heart and there was an urgent need to be able to open the heart and fully correct the defects. For this a heart-lung machine was needed and at Hammersmith Hospital Denis Melrose invented a pump oxygenator in 1952, with which Cleland performed the first such open heart operation in Britain in 1957. Having seen the apparatus, Alexander Bakulev from Moscow was keen to buy one and start open heart surgery in the Soviet Union. He invited Melrose to bring the Hammersmith team, with Cleland and Hugh Bentall as the surgeons, and four others, to visit Moscow in May 1959. Four children with congenital heart disease were selected for surgery. Two of them were very blue children with the tetralogy of Fallot, a condition on which the team had never before operated. But all four operations were successful and the deputy prime minister, Anastas Mikoyan, embraced the theatre sister, Phyllis Bowtle, saying, &#145;Doctors are clean, but politicians are dirty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 16 May 1959). This was probably the first time that a foreign medical team had actually worked in the Soviet Union, as distinct from just being shown around.<br>
<br>In 1968 an article by Cleland and his colleagues in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> entitled &#145;A decade of open heart surgery&#146; gave details of 1200 operations, which showed the safety of using extra-corporeal circulation, and he published a landmark paper in <span class="italic">Thorax</span> in 1983, &#145;The evolution of cardiac surgery in the United Kingdom&#146;. He wrote chapters on heart surgery for several textbooks and over seventy papers. He continued to do pulmonary operations and his paper in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1963 comparing surgery with radiotherapy remained throughout his lifetime one of the very few randomized trials in lung cancer surgery. He edited the <span class="italic">Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery</span> from 1978 to 1983.<br>
<br>Cleland was an unflappable and meticulous surgeon, and the theatre was always calm when he was operating. Although he was seemingly unhurried, quite suddenly an operation would be finished. Many surgeons and physicians from Britain and abroad came to Hammersmith to learn new techniques and Cleland lectured and performed heart operations in Europe and the Middle East. For his work in their countries he was made a commander of the order of the Falcon of Iceland and a commander of the order of the Lion of Finland. He was the first director of surgery at the Institute for Diseases of the Chest at the Brompton Hospital, London, where one of his colleagues was the pioneer chest and cardiac surgeon Russell Claude Brock. Cleland was an extremely hard worker and outside the operating theatre he was very active in promoting his specialism by teaching, writing, and lecturing, and he trained many young surgeons from abroad who later themselves became leaders in their own countries.<br>
<br>Cleland, known to all as Bill, was a strongly built man with a soft Australian accent. He was warm hearted, always a pleasure to be with, and someone who others felt instinctively could be completely trusted and reliable. Latterly he and his wife lived in Green Meadows, an eighteenth-century mill house in Goodworth Clatford, near Andover in Hampshire, with a trout stream running through the property. He was an outstanding angler, fishing being his main hobby, and the salmon of the River Spey, Lapland, and Iceland were magnets for him. At home he was a keen gardener and beekeeper, and he usually won top prizes in the annual village show at Goodworth Clatford, where he was much loved for his modesty, wisdom, and wit. Second only to fishing was his great love of opera, with Angela Gheorghiu latterly his favourite diva. He was proud of his ancestry and he became the twenty-sixth head of an ancient Scottish family that traced its history back to a cousin of William Wallace. In his nineties he was physically frail but as alert as ever. He died comfortably and peacefully at home in his own bed on 29 March 2005 after only a short illness. A lifelong friend remarked, &#145;How typical of Bill to have arranged his death so well&#146;  (private information). The main cause of death was malignant neoplasm of the prostate. He was cremated at Salisbury and survived by his three children.<br>
