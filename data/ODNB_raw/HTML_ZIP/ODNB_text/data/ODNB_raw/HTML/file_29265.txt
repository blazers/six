<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White,  Richard</span>  (1539&#150;1611), <span class="occ">antiquary and jurist</span>, was born in Basingstoke in 1539, the son of Henry White, who died at the siege of Boulogne in 1544, and of his wife, Agnes, daughter of Richard Capelin of Southampton. In 1553 White entered Winchester College, and he proceeded to New College, Oxford, in 1555, where he was elected a perpetual fellow, a post declared void through his absence in 1564. He took the BA degree on 30 May 1559. A Roman Catholic, White left England in 1560 and moved to Louvain, where he delivered two orations, &#145;De circulo artium et philosophiae&#146; and &#145;De eloquentia et Cicerone&#146;. These were subsequently published in London in 1565 under the title <span class="italic">Orationes duae</span>, with an introduction by Christopher Jonson, headmaster of Winchester College, testifying that White delivered these two lectures to a large audience in the law school at Louvain. White matriculated at Louvain in September 1559.<br>
<br>In 1563 White went to the University of Padua and delivered further orations; in August 1563 the &#145;Pro divitiis regum&#146;, and, at Pavia on 11 November 1566 an oration &#145;Pro doctoratu&#146;, containing many details of his education and teachers at both Winchester and Oxford, mentioning his Winchester headmaster, Christopher Jonson, his Oxford teacher Thomas Butler, and his teachers at Padua, who included the famous jurist Guido Panciroli. These four orations, with the addition of a fifth, &#145;De studiorum finibus&#146;, were printed as <span class="italic">Orationes quinque</span> in Arras in 1596, edited by his son Thomas White. This edition was reprinted at Douai in 1604 with the addition of two further orations. In 1572 White was appointed regius professor of law at Douai, a post he retained for the next twenty years. He became a rector of Douai, and was appointed a count palatine of the Holy Roman empire. White was married twice, first to a lady whose surname was Bonvicta, whose fathers and brothers were senators of Douai. The name of his second wife is not recorded. His works contain references to several children, among them Richard, Thomas, Adrian, Peter, and Mary.<br>
<br>White is remembered chiefly for his legal and antiquarian writings. An early work, <span class="italic">Aelia Laelia Crispis antiquum epitaphium</span> (Padua, 1568; reprinted Dordrecht, 1618), discusses an inscription found in the territory of Bologna. A lengthy volume, <span class="italic">Ad leges decemvirorum libri in duodecim tabulis notae, institutiones juris civilis in quattuor libris, primam partem digestorum in quattuor libris</span> (Arras, 1597), is dedicated to Philip II of Spain. The aim of the work is to discuss and comment on the texts that were studied in the first year of a seven-year law degree. The <span class="italic">Brevis explicatio privilegiorum iuris, et consuetudinis, circa venerabile sacramentum eucharistiae</span> (Douai, 1609) was written in 1583, and discusses a canon of Pope Clement V concerning relics and the veneration of saints. The books of the <span class="italic">Historia Britanniae</span>, which appeared in sections in eleven books at Arras and Douai between 1597 and 1607, books one to nine being reprinted together at Douai in 1602, represent White's masterwork. This is a learned, though of course misguided, attempt to justify the truth of the &#145;British history&#146; as set out originally by Geoffrey of Monmouth, tracing the story of Britain from the time of Brutus the Trojan. There are certain details of the story with which White disagrees, but essentially he was at one with such scholars as John Leland, Sir John Price, and Humphrey Llwyd in accepting the essential validity of the &#145;British history&#146;. John Selden, too, quotes him as an authority in his notes to Michael Drayton's <span class="italic">Poly-Olbion</span> (London, 1612). White assembles an impressive collection of written, antiquarian, and philological arguments to justify his beliefs, and cites numerous highly obscure sources. He was encouraged in his work by Cardinal Baronius, to whom book two of the <span class="italic">Historia</span> is independently dedicated. The <span class="italic">Brevis explicatio martyrii Sanctae Ursulae et undecim millium virginum Britannarum</span> (Douai, 1610) is reprinted from book six of his <span class="italic">Historia Britanniae</span>, and discusses the famous legend of St Ursula and the 11,000 virgins. White's scholarly works are a notable instance of the use, unusual at this time, of detailed endnotes to support the arguments in the main body of his text. He died in 1611 and was buried in the church of St Jacques at Douai.<br>
