<span class="headword">Joyce <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Barnacle]</span>,  Nora Joseph</span>  (1884&#150;1951), <span class="occ">wife and muse of James Joyce 1882&#150;1941</span>, was born on 21 or 22 March 1884 at the Galway union workhouse hospital, co. Galway, Ireland, the second of eight children born to Thomas Barnacle (1846&#150;1921) and Honoraria (Annie) Healy (<i>c</i>.1859&#150;1939), of Sullivan's Lane, Galway. Nora was educated at the Convent of Mercy national school in Galway. Fostered as a child with her grandmother, she worked from the age of twelve at the Presentation Convent, Galway; then, having run away from home in 1904, as a chambermaid at Finn's Hotel, Leinster Street, Dublin. On 10 June 1904 on Nassau Street in Dublin her auburn hair, confident figure, and bold walk caught the eye of the young writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34247/', "James Joyce")</script>. Their first evening together so changed Joyce's life that he later set the entire action of his great novel <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> (1922) on that day, 16 June 1904.<br>
<br>The young couple ran away unmarried to the continent on 8 October 1904, settling in Habsburg Austria&#151;first in Pola, next in Trieste, where Joyce taught English in a Berlitz school. Their first child, Giorgio (1905&#150;1976), was born, and they were soon joined by Joyce's brother Stanislaus (1884&#150;1955), who became a permanent resident there. In the following year the family moved to Rome, where Joyce worked in a bank and also wrote &#145;The Dead&#146;, the last and greatest of his short story collection <span class="italic">Dubliners</span> (1914). Nora is widely thought to be the model for the red-haired Gretta Conroy in that story. When they returned to Trieste, the couple's second child, (Anna) Lucia Joyce (1907&#150;1982), was born, and two of Joyce's unmarried sisters, Eileen (1889&#150;1963) and Eva (1891&#150;1957), came from Dublin to join the household (Eva stayed only briefly). By now the Joyce family spoke Italian at home and Nora ceased active practice of her religion out of respect for Joyce's apostasy.<br>
<br>During the Trieste years Nora's portrait was painted by the artist Tullio Silvestri, who said she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She also attracted the attentions of Roberto Prezioso, editor of the <span class="italic">Piccolo della Sera</span>, and Joyce broke with this good friend out of jealousy. Joyce's terror of being cuckolded underlay the novel <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, which he had begun to write, and also his play <span class="italic">Exiles</span> (1918).<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the First World War, the Joyces (without Stanislaus and Eileen) took refuge in Z&uuml;rich. Joyce continued to work on <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, and in 1918 Nora played Cathleen in the English Players' production of J. M. Synge's <span class="italic">Riders to the Sea</span>, directed by Joyce. In Z&uuml;rich, Ottocaro Weiss (a Triestine banker) made his admiration of Nora known. There is no evidence that she was ever unfaithful to Joyce, rather that he was manipulating his jealousy for his own literary purposes. She wept to Frank Budgen, a close friend of Joyce's, &#145;Jim wants me to go with other men so that he can write about it&#146;  (Budgen, 188).<br>
<br>With the war's end, the Joyces returned to Trieste but the city, now part of Italy and no longer a major port, was dull. Ezra Pound persuaded Joyce to move his family to Paris, which he did in 1920. Nora began mastering her third foreign language, and with the money lavished on them by Joyce's selfless English patron, Harriet Shaw Weaver, she learned the delights of the Paris couture houses. Joyce, increasingly troubled by failing sight and more than ever dependent on Nora's strength, indulged her. She was never over-respectful. She refused to read <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>. When he became a literary celebrity after the publication of <span class="italic">Ulysses</span>, she told friends, &#145;I've always told him he should give up writing and take up singing&#146;  (Ellmann, 561). Of &#145;Work in Progress&#146;, the developing <span class="italic">Finnegans Wake</span>, she said to him &#145;Why don't you write sensible books that people can understand?&#146;  (Ellmann, 590).<br>
<br>Nora made a full recovery from two operations for uterine cancer in November 1928 and February 1929. With Joyce she moved briefly to London in 1931. They married on 4 July at the Kensington register office, &#145;for testamentary reasons&#146;, Joyce told the press. (Both Nora and James Joyce remained British subjects all their lives.) Nora was happy to be married at last. However, the unexpected press publicity upset her family in Galway and also Lucia Joyce, who had thought her parents were married already. Shortly afterwards the Joyces returned to Paris, where they lived during the 1930s. Those years were marred for Nora by her daughter's severe mental collapse, but brightened by the marriage of her son to Helen Kastor Fleischman of New York, and by the birth of her grandson Stephen James Joyce on 15 February 1932.<br>
<br>The Joyces left Paris in late 1939 in advance of the Nazis' entry, leaving Lucia behind in a psychiatric clinic in Brittany, but accompanied by their son (whose wife too had suffered a psychiatric illness) and their grandson. They lived in the village of St G&eacute;rand-le-Puy near Vichy. In December 1940, with the help of Swiss friends, they moved back to Z&uuml;rich. A month later Joyce died unexpectedly from a perforated ulcer and was buried in Z&uuml;rich's Fluntern cemetery.<br>
<br>As a widow Nora remained in Z&uuml;rich, with her loyal son nearby. She resumed the practice of her Catholic religion. In the post-war years she hoped to have her husband's body returned to Ireland in honour, as W. B. Yeats's had been in 1948, but in the puritanical Ireland of Eamon de Valera, Joyce remained a scandalous writer. From Z&uuml;rich, living in pensions, Nora was sought out by the increasing numbers of Joyce scholars, who experienced the tart tongue and Irish common sense so prized by Joyce, for whom, as they wandered Europe, she had been his portable Ireland. Asked her opinion of Andr&eacute; Gide, the widow replied, &#145;When you've been married to the greatest writer in the world, you don't remember all the little fellows&#146;  (Ellmann, 743). As for Joyce's favourite authors, she replied, &#145;He spent a good deal of time reading himself&#146;  (Maddox, 475). Upon her death on 10 April 1951, from uraemic poisoning, she too was buried in Fluntern cemetery, though in a separate grave; in 1966 the bodies were reinterred in a new joint grave.<br>
<br>Nora's influence on Joyce, both personal and literary, was long underplayed by Joyce scholars, who tended to see her as an unworthy and uneducated consort of the great writer. Yet she was the model for his principal women characters, including Bertha in his play <span class="italic">Exiles</span> and Anna Livia Plurabelle in <span class="italic">Finnegans Wake</span>. In time, however, scholars came to note the connection between Nora, with her unpunctuated writing and uninhibited speaking styles, and Joyce's most famous female creation, Molly Bloom, whose earthy rambling soliloquy brings <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> to a close. Nora was the subject of portraits by at least two painters, Tullio Silvestri and Myron Nutting, and the photographer Berenice Abbott, while two biographies and a film (<span class="italic">Nora</span>, directed by Pat Murphy) have chronicled her life. Her mother's home at Bowling Green in Galway is now a museum.<br>
