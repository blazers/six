<span class="headword">Willys, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1614, <em>d.</em> 1690), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and conspirator</span>, was baptized on 13 January 1614 at All Saints' Church, Hertford, the second son of Richard Willys (<i>d</i>. 1625), lawyer, of Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire, and the Inner Temple, London, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1629), daughter of William Henmarsh of Balls, Hertfordshire. The manor of Fen Ditton had been granted to Willys's grandfather Thomas Willys by James I in 1605. Educated at St John's School in Hertford, and Christ's College at Cambridge, matriculating in 1631, Willys was admitted to Gray's Inn in the same year. He had, however, already embarked on a military career in the Dutch service. He distinguished himself at the siege of Breda in 1637 and in 1639 was back in England, serving in the bishops' wars of that and the following year. He was made a member of the king's guard at Whitehall in 1641&#150;2.<br>
<br>Knighted at Shrewsbury, the headquarters of Prince Rupert, in October 1642 for his conduct in a cavalry skirmish, Willys was then appointed colonel of horse under Viscount Grandison, surrendering with him at Winchester in December and, like him, breaking his parole. By the autumn of 1643 he was major-general to Arthur, Lord Capel in Cheshire. Captured in a raid on the royalist camp at Ellesmere in January 1644, he spent nine months in the Tower of London before being exchanged. He returned to Oxford in October and by January 1645 he had joined Prince Rupert near Bath.<br>
<br>In May, Willys was appointed governor of Newark and colonel-general of Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Rutland. But his enjoyment of this licence to plunder one of the richest parts of England was short-lived. In October the king arrived, pursued by Rupert, whom he had dismissed his service and forbidden his presence. Willys, in defiance of the royal wishes, marched out to welcome his old commanding officer. After scenes of tension memorably recounted by Edward Hyde, first earl of Clarendon, Willys was replaced as governor by John, Baron Belasyse, whom he at once challenged to a duel. He finally withdrew with Rupert and, like him, was at length formally reconciled to the king, being pardoned on 3 April 1646 and created baronet on 11 June. He then went abroad, mostly to Italy, returning to Fen Ditton in the summer of 1652.<br>
<br>Willys's claim to fame, or infamy, rests on his membership of the Sealed Knot, the inner ring of six royalist conspirators, all of them, except Willys, aristocrats. Two indeed were peers, one the Lord Belasyse with whom Willys again quarrelled fiercely, perhaps even sending him a second challenge. The Knot came into existence about November 1653 and throughout its six years of intermittent activity achieved less than nothing. Younger, more daring conspirators, such as John (later Viscount) Mordaunt, regarded it with contempt if not positive suspicion. Willys, who was imprisoned in 1654 and 1655, in fact reached an understanding with John Thurloe, Cromwell's chief of intelligence, almost certainly by the autumn of 1656 and on his own admission by March or April 1657. In exchange for information Thurloe undertook that no royalist life should be taken as a result of it. The operation of the system is strikingly instanced in the secret visit to London of James Butler, marquess of Ormond, one of the king's chief advisers, in January 1658. He conferred with Willys, who duly informed Thurloe of his whereabouts, having first warned Ormond to change his lodgings, so enabling him to keep one jump ahead of the pursuit. In or before 1659 Willys married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1684&times;8), daughter and heir of Thomas Fox of Warlies, Waltham Holy Cross, Essex. They had at least two children.<br>
<br>On 3 July 1659 Willys was placarded on the Exchange as a traitor to the king. A few weeks later Samuel Morland, one of Thurloe's assistants, betrayed Willys to the king and Hyde, sending over letters whose hand they recognized. Willys was instantly denounced but many ardent royalists, including three of his colleagues in the Knot, refused to accept his guilt. Morland, a notoriously untrustworthy man, openly boasted of his skill as a forger. But the weight of evidence, including Willys's own defence, is overwhelming. His motives, on the other hand, remain anything but clear. On 15 May 1660 Willys was condemned but pardoned, on condition of never again coming into the king's presence or entering the verges of the court. He lived on quietly at Fen Ditton, where he was buried on 9 December 1690. His will, proved in December of that year, shows him to have been in easy circumstances.<br>
