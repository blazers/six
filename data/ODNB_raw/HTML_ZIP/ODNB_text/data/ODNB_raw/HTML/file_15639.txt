<span class="headword">Kinwelmersh <span class="st"> [Kinwelmershe, Kindlemarsh]</span>,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1538), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 18 October 1538, the son of Richard Kinwelmersh or Kyndelmershe of All Hallows, Bread Street, London. The poet entered Gray's Inn in 1557. Two students of the same surname, Anthony and Robert, were admitted in 1561 and 1563 respectively and were probably his brothers. At least one of them was the son of the man who built lodgings at Gray's Inn known as &#145;Kyndelmarshes buyldings&#146;, so the Kinwelmershes would have been a substantial presence there in the 1560s. Francis and Anthony were probably part of a literary clique at Gray's Inn which included Alexander Neville; in 1565 the poet George Gascoigne wrote his &#145;Memories&#146; in response to a challenge set by their &#145;felowship&#146;.<br>
<br>The following year Kinwelmersh collaborated with Gascoigne on <span class="italic">Jocasta</span>, a translation of Dolce's <span class="italic">Giocasta</span>, itself based on Euripides' <span class="italic">Phoenissae</span>, which was performed in the hall of their inn in the course of 1566 and first published in Gascoigne's anonymous <span class="italic">A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres</span> in 1573. Kinwelmersh was responsible for acts <span class="smallcap">I</span> and <span class="smallcap">IV</span>. The play has been noted as the first Greek tragedy on the English stage. Gabriel Harvey called it a &#145;statelie tragedie&#146; in his copy  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Mal. 792, sig. 2B) and Roger, Lord North, kept a manuscript of the play  (BL, Add. MS 34063). <span class="italic">STC, 1475&#150;1640</span>, attributes to Francis Kinwelmersh the translation of Adrien le Roy's <span class="italic">A Briefe and Plaine Instruction &hellip; for the Lute</span> (1574).<br>
<br>Kinwelmersh was a contributor to <span class="italic">The Paradyse of Dainty Devises</span> (1576), and his initials, F. K., and, in later editions, F. Kindlemarsh, appear on the title-page. In all the editions, several poems carry his initials and one (&#145;For Whitsunday&#146;) is signed M. Kindlemarsh.<br>
<br>F. K. is mentioned in complimentary terms by William Webbe in <span class="italic">A Discourse of English Poetrie</span> (1586); and in Bodenham's preface to <span class="italic">Bel-vedere, or, The Garden of the Muses</span> (1600), Francis Kindlemarsh, esquire, is listed with Norton, Gascoigne, Atchelow, and Whetstone among deceased authors to whose published and unpublished writings &#145;due right&#146; is given by the compiler.<br>
<br>The poet is probably the Francis Kinwelmersh of Charlton, Shropshire, whose will was proved on 21 October 1589; he died in financial difficulties, leaving his lease of Charlton mortgaged for &pound;100 to his wife, Cicely. This Kinwelmersh administered his brother Thomas's estate in May 1575 and died before 16 May 1580, when a new administrator was appointed. The <span class="roman">History of Parliament</span> also identifies the poet as the Francis Kinwelmershe, esquire, elected MP for Droitwich, Worcestershire, in 1571 and then for Bossiney, Cornwall, on 27 April 1572 (probably by the patronage of Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford, who controlled the borough; Russell's name had appeared next to Kinwelmersh's in the admission register of Gray's Inn).<br>
