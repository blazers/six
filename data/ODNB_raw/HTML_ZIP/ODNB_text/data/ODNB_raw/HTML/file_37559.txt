<span class="headword">Holford,  Robert Stayner</span>  (1808&#150;1892), <span class="occ">art and plant collector</span>, was born at Westonbirt, Gloucestershire, on 16 March 1808, the only child of George Peter Holford, master in chancery, of Westonbirt, and his wife, Anne, daughter of the Revd Averill Daniel of Lifford, co. Donegal. Holford graduated BA from Oriel College, Oxford, in 1829. In 1838 he inherited &pound;1 million from his uncle, Robert Holford.<br>
<br>Holford's earliest zeal was for landscape gardening. In 1829 he began the arboretum at Westonbirt, where a tract of sandy loam covering 114 acres allowed trees from almost any country in the world to be planted and raised. The increasing collection of different species of trees and plants&#151;skilfully grouped by season or by collections of single types of tree, and designed in glades, avenues, and drives&#151;caused the eventual expansion of the arboretum to 600 acres.<br>
<br>Holford began to collect works of art in 1839 and became one of the most distinguished collectors of his time, with an enthusiasm for the Italian Renaissance. The diarist A. N. L. Munby described him as &#145;a collector with an eye for quality and the means to indulge it without stint&#146;. No doubt in tribute to the superb quality of his illuminated manuscripts and early printed books, he referred to Holford as the &#145;Ideal Connoisseur&#146;. Apart from his pictures, manuscripts, and early printed books, Holford collected old-master prints and etchings by Rembrandt, sculpture, Della Robbia ware, bronze portrait busts, maiolica, porcelain, furniture, tapestries, and gold- and silversmiths' work.<br>
<br>The picture collection, made with the help of the dealer William Buchanan, was formed chiefly between 1840 and 1860 from most of the important auctions in London and from Italian collections. Holford's collection included works by Rubens, Vel&aacute;zquez, Justus Sustermans, Van Dyck, and Rembrandt; French and Italian landscapes by Claude, Gaspard Dughet, Nicolas Poussin, and Salvator Rosa; Dutch landscape and genre painters; the early Flemish school; and English portraits.<br>
<br>In 1849 Holford purchased the freehold of the old Dorchester House, with its 100 yards of frontage to Park Lane, London: he chose Lewis Vulliamy as his architect to design the Italianate palazzo he planned for the site. He commissioned much of the interior decoration from Alfred Stevens; there was a special relationship between patron and sculptor, whereby Stevens was given a very free hand. The house, completed in 1856, was celebrated for its huge marble staircase and for the splendid series of staterooms on the <i>piano nobile</i>, designed for the reception and display of Holford's collections. Between 1863 and 1870 he rebuilt Westonbirt, again commissioning Vulliamy, but choosing an Elizabethan design.<br>
<br>Holford served as Conservative MP for East Gloucestershire from 1854 to 1872 and was a JP, but he took little interest in politics. He was an original member of the Burlington Fine Arts Club. On 5 August 1854 he married Mary Anne, daughter of Lieutenant-General James Lindsay MP of Balcarres, Fife, and thus became brother-in-law to three collectors: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16686/', "Alexander Lindsay (twenty-fifth earl of Crawford)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34544/', "Robert Lindsay (Baron Wantage)")</script>, and the owner of the Grosvenor Gallery, Sir Coutts Lindsay. Holford and his wife had three daughters and one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62979/', "Lieutenant-Colonel Sir George Holford (1860&#150;1926)")</script>. Holford died on 22 February 1892 at Dorchester House, London, and was buried in Westonbirt churchyard. The collection was sold after the death of his son, at Christies, London.<br>
