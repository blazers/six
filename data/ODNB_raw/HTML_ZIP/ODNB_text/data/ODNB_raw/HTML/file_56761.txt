<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hardcastle,  William <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1918&#150;1975), <span class="occ">journalist and radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 26 March 1918 at 5 Sydenham Terrace, Newcastle upon Tyne, last of the four children of William Hardcastle (1873&#150;1924), medical officer at Newcastle prison, and his wife, Mary Constance Wardroper (1883&#150;1967). William (Bill) Hardcastle's education at Durham School was cut short when, aged sixteen, he contracted osteomyelitis, and was in and out of hospital for the next four years. Nevertheless he read voraciously in the intervals between repeated painful operations which left his arms and legs deeply scarred. Though he had to abandon long-standing plans to become the fourth successive Hardcastle in the medical profession, he was able, in 1938, to start work with a Newcastle house agent. He hated the job and soon left to become a cub reporter on the <span class="italic">South Shields Gazette</span> and later the <span class="italic">North Shields Evening News</span>. His three years on Tyneside during the depression of the late thirties were to leave a lasting mark.<br>
<br>Unfit for military service in the Second World War, Hardcastle moved to Yorkshire to become a sub-editor on the <span class="italic">Sheffield Telegraph</span> and then on to London to work briefly for Kemsley Newspapers. In 1943 he joined Reuters news agency on the editorial desk and early in 1945, after a brief spell at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force), was sent to New York and later to Washington as Reuters junior correspondent. His first big break was a casually distributed White House handout on what had seemed a slow day for news, with President Truman on the way home from the Potsdam conference. Dull the handout was not: in a state of shock he rushed to the phone to dictate his copy to London: &#145;The first atomic bomb, most powerful bomb in the world, was dropped sixteen hours ago on Hiroshima&#146;  (Hardcastle, &#145;Time of my life&#146;).<br>
<br>Long afterwards, Hardcastle remembered those early post-war years in the USA as &#145;a newspaperman's dream&#146;, and indeed it was the ideal place for an ambitious young journalist to learn his trade. He was in his element, making many friends and greatly enjoying the whole lively Washington scene with his wife and young family. He had in 1945 married the widow of a Royal Air Force pilot, Constance May Turton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ashmore (1923&#150;1987); they had four children. The marriage was dissolved in 1960.<br>
<br>Hardcastle's eight years in America were briefly interrupted when, in May 1949, Reuters made him their chief of bureau in Rome&#151;a promotion; yet after only three months in the job he resigned. Early in 1950 he was again in Washington, this time correspondent for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. In December 1952 he returned to London to become news editor and later deputy editor on the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. By then Hardcastle had become every inch the tough, American-style newsman&#151;shirt-sleeved, cigarette-smoking, hard-drinking, insatiable in the pursuit of news. So successful did he prove that in October 1959 the proprietor of Associated Newspapers, the second Lord Rothermere, appointed him as editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, and his revitalization of that ailing journal prompted Rothermere after only two months to sack Arthur Wareham, the &#145;quiet man&#146; who had edited the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> for eight years, and install Hardcastle in his place.<br>
<br>Circulation had been falling, the paper needed a face-lift, and this tough newsman seemed the man for the job. Yet, although he tried to widen the appeal of a dyed-in-the-wool Conservative journal by bringing in writers with a wider, more radical outlook and recruiting lively columnists and gossip writers, readers gradually fell away despite over a million inherited from the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> when it was taken over by the <span class="italic">Mail</span> in October 1960.<br>
<br>In fact, Hardcastle was not entirely at home in the editorial chair: for one of his temperament it provided too little action and too much administration, which he did not enjoy and for which he proved unsuited. One of his columnists, Alan Brien, recalled how his in-tray piled up with urgent decisions he seemed unable to face, and how he gradually sank into a deep depression when &#145;nothing seemed of any importance&#146;. After three years Rothermere too had had enough: Hardcastle was dispatched on a fact-finding trip to the USA early in 1963, only to find himself out of a job on his return.<br>
<br>Without salaried employment for the first time in his working life, Hardcastle launched into freelancing for radio and television; and when, in 1965, the BBC planned an innovatory lunchtime radio news programme, <span class="italic">The World at One</span>, its editor, Andrew Boyle, chose Hardcastle as presenter. So began a second career which was not only to make his a household name in radio journalism but to give the &#145;wireless&#146;, as he liked to call it, a much-needed shot in the arm at a time when television seemed to be taking over.<br>
<br>Boyle and Hardcastle between them injected a new immediacy into the BBC's carefully correct current affairs output. Not only was the latter's urgent, breathless presentation&#151;so alien to the hitherto customary staid and measured delivery&#151;a somewhat startling innovation, but <span class="italic">The World at One</span> itself set out to be provocative. Stimulating new commentators were brought in; hot news was relentlessly pursued wherever it might be happening; and, basically serious though the programme remained, it took a not always reverent look at the passing scene.<br>
<br>Hardcastle quickly adapted to the new medium, bringing with him as presenter and interviewer an encyclopaedic knowledge of home and foreign affairs from his years in print journalism, as well as an instinctive ability to know what questions to ask, whether interviewing some quaking newcomer to the microphone or an evasive politician. With the latter his questioning was relentlessly persistent; but seldom rude and abrasive.<br>
<br>For Hardcastle the great attraction of radio was the speed, immediacy, and flexibility with which it could tackle the news: planned items or even a whole programme could be abandoned if some important story broke at the last moment. No wonder, then, that for him <span class="italic">The World at One</span> marked &#145;a real adventure in journalism&#146;, and its later Sunday edition, <span class="italic">The World this Weekend</span>, &#145;a further stride down the same exciting road&#146;.<br>
<br>&#145;It was journalism of the highest order,&#146; wrote Asa Briggs, author of the official history of British broadcasting, but he continued: &#145;none the less, the programme did not escape criticism from politicians, including the Prime Minister&#146;  (Briggs, 578). The prime minister in question, Harold Wilson, had complained to the BBC's governors, who, while agreeing that &#145;occasional lapses of judgment&#146; were unacceptable, added that they were &#145;loath to sacrifice the real achievements of these programmes in the field of popular news presentation&#146;  (ibid.). Yet Wilson and his Conservative successor, Edward Heath, were always ready to face yet another of Hardcastle's tough, searching grillings: according to Heath, &#145;an interview with him was always an important matter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 11 Nov 1975).<br>
<br>As Hardcastle wrote in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> shortly before his death, &#145;it would be wrong to assume that we were greatly loved. We were brash and cheeky and unappreciative of the many excellences of the BBC&#146;  (Hardcastle, &#145;Ten years&#146;). For their part too, top people in the BBC hierarchy were themselves sometimes unappreciative of these often provocative programmes: indeed, when in 1974 Hardcastle's appearances as presenter were cut from four to three days a week, there were those who believed that the BBC management had yielded to political pressure on the grounds of his alleged left-wing bias, though he was always careful not to let his personal opinions obtrude.<br>
<br>Yet audiences for <span class="italic">The World at One</span>, <span class="italic">The World this Weekend</span>, and the afternoon edition, <span class="italic">P.M. Reports</span>, multiplied, and within a decade similar programmes had become a commonplace in both radio and television.<br>
<br>Hardcastle was a large, untidy person, never happier than when working under pressure in shirt-sleeves in a kind of creative chaos. He was stimulating though not always easy to work with: his professionalism made him impatient with those who did not match his high standards, though his often searing strictures were tempered by an unfailing sense of humour and ready support for inexperienced young journalists.<br>
<br>Always a workaholic, he drove himself too hard, with weekly columns in <span class="italic">Punch</span> and <span class="italic">The Listener</span> and other journalism, as well as the relentless pressure of twice-daily radio programmes. He paid the price: on a Friday evening after a heavy day at the BBC and on the eve of a fortnight's holiday, he had a massive stroke and died three days later, on 10 November 1975, in Epsom Hospital. He was buried at St Mary's churchyard at Headley in Surrey, across the fields from Webb's Farm Cottage, which had been his home for the past fifteen years.<br>
