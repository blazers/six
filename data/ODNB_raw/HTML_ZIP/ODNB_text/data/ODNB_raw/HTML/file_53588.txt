<span class="headword">Suter,  Fergus <span class="st"> [Fergie]</span></span>  (1857&#150;1916), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, the only son of David Suter, a journeyman stonemason, and his wife, Catherine (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke), was born at 159 Shamrock Street, Glasgow, on 21 November 1857. He began his football career with Partick Thistle in 1878, but was attracted to Turton in Lancashire for he saw, like other Scottish players, the potential in the clubs of Lancashire and Yorkshire. He appeared for Turton Football Club in a local cup competition and was paid &pound;3 for his service. This broke the rules but within twelve months he had joined the Darwen club.<br>
<br>Suter, like his father, was a stonemason by trade but when he performed his craft with Lancashire stone his hands and arms began to swell. Concentrating on football without financial payment was hard, so a benefit match between Darwen and Turton was played in the spring of 1879 to help him and a fellow Scot, Jimmy Love, to survive as the earliest &#145;professionals&#146; in an amateur game. In a short period of time his captaincy of Darwen had revolutionized the side, and it was even challenging the supremacy of the top teams such as the Old Etonians.<br>
<br>To the disappointment of the fans and the officials Fergie Suter, as he was known, left Darwen for Blackburn Rovers in 1880. He found a normal employment at a cotton mill but resentment at his leaving Darwen culminated in a serious disturbance when he played against his old club before a crowd of 10,000 at Alexandra Meadows on 24 November 1880. Suter was deliberately fouled by a Darwen player and a large section of the crowd invaded the pitch, forcing Sam Ormerod, as the referee, to abandon the game.<br>
<br>The coming of Suter and his Scottish colleagues (known as the &#145;Scotch professors&#146; on account of their technical proficiency) brought a new era to Blackburn Rovers. Within two years they were regarded as the outstanding team. Suter, a full-back, played a key role, as in the 1882 cup final, when they lost 1&#150;0 to the Old Etonians. His magnificent exhibition on that occasion was so outstanding that the two MPs for Blackburn, W. E. Briggs and Sir William Coddington, entertained him and his colleagues to a dinner. Losing in the cup final again in 1883 to their neighbours Blackburn Olympics spurred Suter and his fellow players to a remarkable period when they won the cup final for three successive years: in 1884 beating Queen's Park, Glasgow, 2&#150;1, in 1885 beating the same side 2&#150;0, and in 1886 defeating West Bromwich Albion 2&#150;0 at Derby after a goalless draw at the Oval. The 1886 final made football history as the first in which two professional clubs appeared: payments to players had been legalized that year largely through the efforts of Blackburn officials, in particular Dr E. S. Morley and T. B. Mitchell.<br>
<br>Suter was in a class of his own, rarely beaten in a tackle, always decisive with his clearances, effective in the air, and dependable at all times. Without his great defensive work his side would not have beaten West Bromwich Albion. He with Herbie Arthur (the goalkeeper) performed miracles, and ensured a special shield for his club from the Football Association (FA) for three consecutive FA cup victories. His playing days came to an end in 1888, the year his club was invited to be one of the founder members of the Football League. Suter's last appearance was on 22 December 1888 against West Bromwich Albion, when he deputized for Arthur in goal.<br>
<br>Suter married at the James Street Independent chapel, Blackburn, on 22 November 1883, Martha (1861&#150;1939), daughter of John Almond, manager at a foundry. They had at least one son and one daughter. Suter's occupation was given as commercial traveller, but, like so many of the first generation of professional footballers, in his retirement from the game he kept a succession of public houses, including the Bay Horse hotel in his adopted town of Blackburn and the White Lion in Darwen. He died of cancer at his home, 8 Seafield Road, North Shore, Blackpool, on 31 July 1916.<br>
