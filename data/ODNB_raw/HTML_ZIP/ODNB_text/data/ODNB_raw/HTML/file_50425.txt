<span class="headword">Claypoole,  James</span>  (1634&#150;1687), <span class="occ">merchant and pioneer settler in America</span>, was born in December 1634 at Northborough Manor, Northamptonshire, the ninth of the fourteen children of John Claypoole or Claypole, a yeoman farmer, and his wife, Mary Angell, the daughter of a wealthy London merchant. When James was eleven his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5567/', "John Claypole")</script> married Elizabeth, the favourite daughter of a neighbour, Oliver Cromwell. After the general's rise to power James's father was made a baronet and John was given various offices in the protector's household.<br>
<br>James Claypoole benefited little from his family's brief prominence as, in 1650, he was apprenticed to a merchant in Bremen. After completing his indentures, on 12 February 1658 he married Helen Mercer (<i>d</i>. 1688) and returned to London to set up in business for himself. He lived first in Nicholas Lane in the City, where his first son, John, was born in November 1658. He then moved to Mincing Lane, where a second child, Mary, was born in 1660, and in 1662 finally settled in Scots Yard, where a further eleven children were born (of whom six survived after the first year) and where he remained until he left England for Pennsylvania in 1683. At some stage he bought a country house in Kingston, which he described as a &#145;small&#146; place for his children and where he often went for weekends.<br>
<br>At this time, when the Quakers were first establishing a foothold in the capital, the Claypooles were convinced by the Friends' teachings and became important members of the Bull and Mouth meeting during the two decades of persecution which followed. Claypoole was not a martyr in the sense of having languished for years in gaol, but he was among those Besse listed as having &#145;frequently exposed themselves, at the hazard of their estates, liberties and lives for the public testimony to the truth&#146;  (Besse, 1.484). The relentlessness of the pressure applied to Quakers was reflected in May 1683, in Claypoole's resigned tone excusing his neglect of a Friend's wife, because he<blockquote>was being tried at the sessions for a riot, for being at a meeting, and [I] had like to have been sent to Newgate, which hindered me many days in my business, and I was harried from one magistrate to another by a warrant and a constable. (Balderston, 210&#150;11)</blockquote>The first meeting for sufferings (1676) was organized in the Claypoole house, as were weekday meetings to keep in touch with other Quaker groups, and leading Friends frequently stayed there. Claypoole was not a scholar but he did contribute to at least two of Penn's pamphlets and was in consultation with Penn and George Fox about the writing of others.<br>
<br>Claypoole's letter-book covering the period from May 1681 to April 1684 provides a valuable insight into the day-to-day workings of a merchant business in a time of rapid expansion and restructuring of English overseas trade. He managed the business with the help of his son James and an indentured apprentice, Edward Haistwell, who had spent two years travelling with Fox. Claypoole operated as both a factor and a merchant on his own account with correspondents in Amsterdam, Bordeaux, Bremen, Hamburg, Ireland, Lisbon, North America, and Barbados. Many were Quakers, although, as he had brothers in Barbados and New Jersey, kin also played a part. Claypoole traded in a wide range of commodities: furs from New York and Hudson Bay; sugar, ginger, indigo, and cotton wool from the West Indies; bullion and fish from New England; linen and wine from Germany, France, and Portugal. London's rising importance as a European entrep&ocirc;t is underlined by the volume of goods re-exported, especially furs to Hamburg for sale in the Baltic and Russia, and linen and wine to the colonies. Claypoole's Quakerism is reflected in plain language, use of numerals for months, and a refusal to take oaths. However, the passing of white sugar for brown to reduce customs duties, the bribing of port officials, his forthright criticism of various friends and relations, and his petty squabbling over minor charges demonstrate less than perfect adherence to Quaker ideals.<br>
<br>In May 1681 William Penn obtained a charter for a new colony in Pennsylvania, and Claypoole was one of the fifty-six subscribers who bought a block of 5000 acres of land for &pound;100. After Penn appointed Claypoole treasurer of the Free Society of Traders, a joint-stock company intended to play a pivotal role in Pennsylvania's economy, the latter purchased a further 5000 acres and made the brave decision to take his family to the new country. He sold his well-established commission business to his neighbours John Bawden and John Gardiner, the leading merchants in London's West India trade.<br>
<br>Claypoole's eldest son, John, migrated in 1682 and the remainder of the family, including seven children and five servants, embarked on the <i>Concord</i> in August 1683 and arrived on 1 October. Claypoole had sent two servants ahead to build a house, which was &#145;40 feet long and 20 broad with a good dry cellar under it which proved an extraordinary conveniency for securing our goods and lodging my family&#146;  (Balderston, 223), but unfortunately there was no fireplace and winter was approaching. Claypoole added a kitchen 20 foot square with a double chimney, and the family settled down in what was to become Walnut Street, Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Claypoole had planned to bring about &pound;700 worth of goods, but probably brought less as he had difficulty collecting all the money owed to him, especially from his brothers John and Norton, and to his great shame as a Quaker he could not entirely clear his own debts before leaving. He remarked on the many promising commercial opportunities in Pennsylvania, and he exchanged wine and dry goods for provisions, whale oil, silver, and furs, which he sent to England or the West Indies. However, he was hindered by his work for the Free Society, which proved more onerous than he had expected, and exclaimed he would not have &#145;undertook it if I had known for three times my salary&#146;  (Balderston, 240). He was paid &pound;100 per annum.<br>
<br>The society's problems were apparent by the time Claypoole arrived. His deputy had sold the first cargo on credit, but it would take time for the pioneer settlers to make payment, and at home investors were reluctant to furnish more capital, leaving subscriptions unpaid. Only five of the thirty-five or so merchants who arrived in Philadelphia in the first four years of its life belonged to the society. They had no intention of allowing such a closed body to monopolize the colony's trade. Instead early commerce fell largely into the hands of individual merchants, acting for themselves or for agents in England. By 1684 Claypoole complained, &#145;we have now neither credit nor money and now must sue or be found to lose all&#146;  (Balderston, 241). The company was itself sued in a number of suits between 1684 and 1686 and it collapsed as a significant factor in Pennsylvania's trade, drawing harsh words for Claypoole from Penn. Attempts to rescue its fortunes failed and it became a mere land company.<br>
<br>Claypoole continued to play a prominent role in Pennsylvania. In February 1684 he acted as interpreter for Penn and Margaret Matson in Pennsylvania's one witchcraft trial, and in November 1685 he was commissioned justice of the peace. In 1686 he served in the assembly; he was made judge of the provincial court in August, and was confirmed as registrar in November. The next spring he was elected to the provincial council. He had been chairman of the court of quarter sessions, and he had many tasks for the meeting as well. In February 1687 Penn appointed five men including Claypoole with practically unlimited powers to act for him in Pennsylvania. He could not have shown his faith in Claypoole's honesty or ability more plainly.<br>
<br>Claypoole died in Philadelphia on 6 August 1687 and was buried the following day in the Quaker burial-ground. His will showed that he had many possessions and his estate was valued at &pound;481 10<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>.<br>
