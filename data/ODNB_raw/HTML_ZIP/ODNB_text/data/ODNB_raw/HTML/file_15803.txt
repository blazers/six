<span class="headword">Knyvett,  William</span>  (1779&#150;1856), <span class="occ">singer and composer</span>, was born on 21 April 1779 in London, the third and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15801/', "Charles Knyvett (1752&#150;1822)")</script>, a musician, and his wife, Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alleway (<i>c</i>.1752&#150;1807). He was educated by his father, by the glee composer Samuel Webbe, and by Giambattista Cimador. In 1788 he sang in the treble chorus at the Concerts of Ancient Music, and in 1795 appeared there as the principal alto. In 1797 he became a gentleman of the Chapel Royal and shortly afterwards a lay clerk at Westminster Abbey. He was appointed composer of the Chapel Royal in 1808, succeeding his father. He helped his father run the Vocal Concerts at Willis's Rooms, and in 1811, with his brother Charles and Thomas Vaughan, established the Vocal Subscription Concerts, which continued until 1822. From 1832 to 1840 he conducted the Concerts of Ancient Music, and he also conducted at the Birmingham festivals from 1831 to 1843 and the York festival in 1835.<br>
<br>One of the finest alto singers of his day, Knyvett sang in London and at provincial festivals, and formed a trio with Samuel Harrison and James Bartleman. The glee &#145;With sighs, sweet rose&#146; was composed for him by John Wall Callcott.<br>
<br>Knyvett was a popular composer for the voice, and his songs and glees included &#145;My love is like the red, red rose&#146; (1803), &#145;The Bells of St Michael's Tower&#146; (1810), &#145;The Boatie Rows&#146; (1810), and &#145;As it fell upon a day&#146; (1812). His glee &#145;When the fair rose&#146; was awarded the prince of Wales prize at the Harmonic Society in 1800. He was also commissioned to write anthems for the coronation of George IV (&#145;The king shall rejoice&#146;) and Queen Victoria (&#145;This is the day the Lord has made&#146;).<br>
<br>Knyvett was married twice. His second wife, whom he married in 1826, was Deborah Travis (1790&#150;1876), a singer, of Shaw, near Oldham, Lancashire. She was one of the Lancashire chorus singers at the Concerts of Ancient Music from 1813 to 1815, and appeared as a principal from 1815. She was much in demand, especially as an oratorio singer, until her retirement in 1843. Knyvett died in poverty on 17 November 1856 at Clarges House, Ryde, Isle of Wight.<br>
