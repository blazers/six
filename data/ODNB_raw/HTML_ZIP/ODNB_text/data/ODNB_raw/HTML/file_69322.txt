<span class="headword">Villiers,  James Michael Hyde</span>  (1933&#150;1998), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 29 September 1933 at 1A Devonshire Terrace, London, the son of Eric Hyde Villiers, a retired brandy distiller, and his wife, Joan Ankaret Talbot. He was educated at Abberley Hall preparatory school, Worcestershire, where he became stage-struck, and at Wellington College, Berkshire. He trained for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and made his professional d&eacute;but at the summer theatre, Frinton, as William Blore in Agatha Christie's <span class="italic">Ten Little Niggers</span> (1953). His first London appearance was at the Prince's in <span class="italic">Toad of Toad Hall</span> (1954) with the Shakespeare Memorial Company. In 1955 he joined the Old Vic, where he played such parts as Trebonius in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Antenor in <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>, and Bushy in <span class="italic">Richard II</span>. The last two he also played on the company's North American tour (1956&#150;7), when he made his New York d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Richard II</span> at the Winter Garden. While spending a year with the English Stage Company at the Royal Court, he appeared in Nigel Dennis's religious satire <span class="italic">The Making of Moo</span> (1957).<br>
<br>Villiers, who claimed descent from George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, and kinship with the earl of Clarendon, quickly became a distinctive character actor. His aristocratic demeanour and plummy accent made him instantly recognizable and much in demand at a time when it was fashionable for actors to have regional accents or a rough edge; not far beneath the surface was a haughty disdain, a supercilious arrogance which usually lent itself to dislikeable characters, some merely ironic or sardonic, others decidedly chilling. His essential good nature, though, ensured that life was enjoyed as fully off the stage as on it.<br>
<br>In 1960 Villiers appeared in the melodrama <span class="italic">Tomorrow&#151;with Pictures</span> at the Lyric, Hammersmith, before transferring to the Duke of York's, but subsequent stage roles in the decade were usually lighter, such as Frederick Knott's <span class="italic">Write me a Murder</span> (1962) at the Lyric, <span class="italic">Everybody Loves Opal</span> (1964), and Brigid Brophy's <span class="italic">The Burglar</span> (1967), both at the Vaudeville. He was, though, becoming more visible in films and on television. His film d&eacute;but, a bit part in <span class="italic">Carry on Sergeant</span> (1958), was followed by Tony Richardson's <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (1960), an unlikely heroic part in <span class="italic">The Clue of the New Pin</span> (1961), and a string of roles in films which epitomized the 1960s, including three for director Joseph Losey&#151;<span class="italic">The Damned</span> (1961), <span class="italic">Eva</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">King and Country</span> (1964)&#151;two Agatha Christie films&#151;<span class="italic">Murder at the Gallop</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">The Alphabet Murders</span> (1966)&#151;Clive Donner's <span class="italic">Nothing but the Best</span> (1964), Roman Polanski's <span class="italic">Repulsion</span> (1965), <span class="italic">The Nanny</span> (1965), as the father opposite Bette Davis, Michael Winner's <span class="italic">You Must be Joking!</span> and Bryan Forbes's <span class="italic">The Wrong Box</span> (both 1966), as well as <span class="italic">Otley</span> (1969), by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. He made numerous television appearances, especially in plays&#151;<span class="italic">The Siege of Manchester</span> (1965), <span class="italic">A Piece of Resistance</span> (1966), and <span class="italic">The Fantasist</span> (1967)&#151;and was a notable Charles II, to whom he bore more than a passing resemblance, in the series <span class="italic">The First Churchills</span> (1969). On 20 August 1966 Villiers married Patricia Nora Donovan (<i>b</i>. 1942/3), a solicitor's assistant, daughter of William Victor Donovan, a retired RAF officer; they divorced in 1984.<br>
<br>The high point in Villiers's stage career was as Victor Prynne in John Gielgud's revival of No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Private Lives</span> (1974) at the Queen's, opposite Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens; some critics felt he improved on Laurence Olivier's original. Villiers played Belcredi in Pirandello's <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> (1974) at Her Majesty's opposite Rex Harrison, and later that year appeared at the Oxford festival as the Earl of Warwick in G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> and, with an excellent comic performance, in Andr&eacute; Roussin's <span class="italic">The Little Hut</span>; the latter transferred to the Duke of York's. He played Sir Ralph Bonnington in Shaw's <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span> (1975) at the Mermaid, and was in an unlikely combination at the Old Vic, <span class="italic">The White Devil</span> and <span class="italic">The Ghost Train</span> (1976). He also enjoyed himself as both Mr Darling and Captain Hook in <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span> (1979) at the Shaftesbury. Among his later roles were Lord Thurlow in <span class="italic">The Madness of George III</span> (1991) at the National and Mr Brownlow in the hit revival of <span class="italic">Oliver!</span> at the Palladium (1994).<br>
<br>Through the 1970s and 1980s Villiers remained just as busy on small and large screen, &#145;enjoying to the full the advantages of the character actor, who often proves more durable than the leads in whose shadows he often lurks&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). His many television appearances included <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> and <span class="italic">The Millionairess</span> (both 1972) and <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> (1973), as Professor Higgins, and in the two mini-series <span class="italic">Fortunes of War</span> (1987) and <span class="italic">Hemingway</span> (1988). He was excellent as the prime minister's sad brother in <span class="italic">House of Cards</span> (1990); a final role was as Buster Foxe in Anthony Powell's <span class="italic">A Dance to the Music of Time</span> (1997). His films included <span class="italic">Blood from the Mummy's Tomb</span> (1971), <span class="italic">The Ruling Class</span> (1972), with long-time friend Peter O'Toole, <span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span> (1977), <span class="italic">Saint Jack</span> (1979), <span class="italic">For your Eyes Only</span> (1981), <span class="italic">Under the Volcano</span> (1984), <span class="italic">Scandal</span> (1989), <span class="italic">Let him have it</span> (1991), and, his last, <span class="italic">The Tichborne Claimant</span> (1998).<br>
<br>Villiers was married again, on 30 July 1994, to Lucinda Claire Noelle (Lucy) Jex (<i>b</i>. 1959/60), a secretary, daughter of Alan Jex, a retired pilot. Away from acting he was a keen follower of cricket and football. He died on 18 January 1998 of cancer at Arundel Hospital, Sussex. His wife survived him.<br>
