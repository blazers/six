<span class="headword">Warburton,  John Paul</span>  (1840&#150;1919), <span class="occ">police officer in India</span>, was born on 28 August 1840 in Kabul, Afghanistan. His mother was Shah Jahan Begum (<i>d</i>. in or after 1866), a member of an Afghan noble family and relative of Shah Shuja, king of Kabul. His adoptive father was Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Warburton (<i>d</i>. 1864) of the Bengal army. The identity of Warburton's natural father is not certain. Warburton was born Jahan Dad Khan, and it is most likely that his father was Shah Jahan Begum's first husband, Sirdar Faiz Talab Khan, a high official in the service of the emir of Kabul. Warburton embraced the culture of his adopted father and typically dressed in English rather than Indian fashion. According to his biographer, G. D. Martineau, &#145;He never saw England, but anyone glancing at him or meeting him casually at a party would have taken him for an Englishman wearing an immaculate suit, of fashionable cut, and often a topi&#146;  (Martineau, 73). Warburton had one younger half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28677/', "Sir Robert Warburton (1842&#150;1899)")</script>, Royal Artillery officer and author of <span class="italic">Eighteen Years in the Khyber</span>. There was a marked difference in the treatment of the two sons. While Robert Warburton was educated in England and secured a commission in the Royal Artillery, John Paul was educated at a Roman Catholic school in Agra. In 1864, possibly through his father's influence, he received a much less prestigious appointment as an assistant superintendent in the Punjab police. A year earlier he had married Mary Whayman (1842&#150;1889), the widow of a British army ensign. They had six children. In 1872 Warburton became superintendent of police in Ludhiana district in the Punjab, where he served for thirteen years.<br>
<br>Warburton gained a reputation as the greatest detective of nineteenth-century India. He was aided in police work by his fluency in several Indian languages, and, according to British observers, his Afghan background was believed to give him an important &#145;native&#146; insight into the workings of the Indian criminal mind. Among Punjabis, Warburton earned the nickname of Button Sahib, and a reputation as &#145;a controller of many devils&#146; that allowed him to gain information about criminal activities. Warburton also had a reputation of being a master of disguise, and popular stories attributed to him the power to change his shape into that of a tiger. In reality, Warburton's success was based on patient and painstaking detective work. According to Percival Griffiths, &#145;It can safely be said that few men have possessed his power of unravelling criminal problems. &hellip; He achieved his results by a remarkable understanding of criminal psychology and by a capacity for relentless, logical deduction from ascertained clues&#146;  (Griffiths, 405).<br>
<br>Much of Warburton's work involved the investigation of &#145;criminal tribes&#146;, such as the Sansiahs, which the colonial state considered to be one of the greatest threats to public order in late nineteenth-century India. He was particularly successful at a common method for dealing with collective crime in British India: persuading gang members to turn approver (or king's witness) in exchange for pardon or reduced sentences. In two of his most famous cases, Warburton broke up a gang of dacoits (gang robbers) who were believed to be responsible for over 600 robberies in the Punjab, and a gang of poisoners who had been active for over two decades. On several occasions he was selected by the government of India for special duties in the investigation of important criminal cases in other provinces. Rudyard Kipling interviewed Warburton about the nature of Indian police work while he was writing the stories that became <span class="italic">Plain Tales from the Hills</span> (1888), and Warburton provided the model for Rudyard Kipling's police character Strickland. In &#145;Miss Youghal's Sais&#146;, the story that introduces Strickland, the narrator writes that Strickland took for his model the one man &#145;in the whole of upper India &hellip; who can pass for Hindu or Mahommedan, hide-dresser or priest, as he pleases. He is feared and respected by the natives from the Ghor Kathri to the Jamma Musjid; and he is supposed to have the gift of invisibility and executive control over many Devils&#146;  (Kipling, 24).<br>
<br>Warburton retired from the Punjab police in 1900, after reaching the rank of assistant inspector-general. After his retirement he served as inspector-general of the Patiala police under Maharaja Rajinder Singh. At George V's 1911 coronation durbar in Delhi, Warburton was made a CIE for his rescue of a British doctor during riots against plague measures in Patiala in 1902. He also received a grant of land in the Punjab for his services, and a village and railway station there were named for him. Warburton died in October 1919 at Kasauli, in the Punjab, following a riding accident.<br>
