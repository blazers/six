<span class="headword">Finch,  Heneage</span>, third earl of Winchilsea  (1627/8&#150;1689), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the ninth child but eldest surviving son of Thomas Finch, second earl of Winchilsea (1578&#150;1639), MP, and his wife, Cicely (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter of John Wentworth of Gosfield, Essex. As the first holder of the title was a woman&#151;Finch's widowed grandmother, created countess of Winchilsea in 1628&#151;he is sometimes known as the second earl. On her death in 1634 he succeeded to the courtesy title of Viscount Maidstone, and in 1639 to the earldom of Winchilsea. His father had already settled the family estates on trustees including Sir William Waller, a brother-in-law of the young heir. Winchilsea matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1644, and on 21 May 1645 married Diana (<i>d</i>. 1648), daughter of Francis, Lord Willoughby of Parham, who was shortly to defect from parliament to the royalists, where Winchilsea's own sympathies lay. In 1649 as a 21-year-old widower he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1672), daughter of William Seymour, marquess of Hertford, settled his estates in turn on trustees, and borrowed heavily against his life interest in order to send supplies to the exiled Charles II and recruit support for him at home. As a peer and head of the influential Finch clan he was a natural leader of the close-knit group of royalists in his part of Kent, and in the abortive rising of 1655 was to have seized first Dover and Rochester, then Colchester for the king. In 1657&#150;8 he travelled extensively on the continent, acquiring a lifelong love of Italy and antiquities.<br>
<br>Back home the political tide was turning in Winchilsea's favour, and in April 1660 he chaired the election meeting which returned royalist members for Kent to the Convention Parliament. Monck then appointed him governor of the castle and town of Dover, where he proclaimed Charles II on 11 May. On the 25th he marshalled the nobility and gentry of Kent to welcome the king on Barham Downs between Dover and Canterbury, where Charles spent the first night of his return, knighting Winchilsea the next day. A month later he was also created Baron Fitzherbert of Eastwell, in allusion to the alleged descent of the Finch family from the Herberts. He was confirmed as governor of Dover and appointed lord lieutenant of Kent and <i>custos rotulorum</i>, colonel of a foot regiment of Kent militia, and captain (later colonel) of the volunteer horse. And at his own request he was nominated as ambassador-extraordinary to the Porte in Constantinople, to remain there as ambassador-in-ordinary on an initial five-year contract with the Levant Company, who paid a large salary and expenses.<br>
<br>Winchilsea sailed in October 1660, taking his wife and baby but leaving behind the five eldest children. As he later told his mother-in-law, it was &#145;to tast a bitter cup, to take leave of my children and nearest relations and friends, and to exchange my native countrey when it was the best worth enjoying, to live amongst barbarians&#146;, but it seemed the only way to repair the family fortunes: &#145;to make my selfe miserable that I might make my posterity happy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 1.470). The voyage was an eventful one, in the course of which the ship was twice nearly lost. The first storm drove her into Lisbon for repairs, in the middle of negotiations for the marriage of Catherine of Braganza. The second storm, and Winchilsea's favourable reception by the grand vizier and sultan, were described in an anonymous <span class="italic">Narrative of the success of the voyage of the right honourable Heneage Finch, earl of Winchelsea</span>, prepared by his secretary Paul Rycaut and published in London in 1661.<br>
<br>The first peer to be appointed to the embassy in Constantinople, Winchilsea lived in some splendour and soon made an ally of the new vizier, Fazil Ahmed K&ouml;pr&uuml;lu. For the earl &#145;was a jolly Lord, and &hellip; having a goodly Person and Mustachios, with a World of Talk, and that all (as his Way was) of mighty Wonders, the Vizier delighted in his Company&#146;  (North, 115). A man of strong passions&#151;the motto on his seal, which translates as &#145;neither elated nor cast down&#146;, could hardly have been less appropriate&#151;he was also fair-minded, and his correspondence breathes trenchant common sense. He was able in January 1662 to renew the capitulations (trading privileges) with a number of important additional articles, and in subsequent years to ensure that any breaches by Ottoman officials were punished. He also represented the English case against the Ottoman dependency of Algiers, where he had negotiated unsuccessfully in 1660, to such effect that an Algerine delegation to the Porte was forced to promise not to search English merchant ships and take out foreign passengers or their goods. This concession had to be reinforced by a naval expedition in 1663&#150;4, but was then observed until 1677, giving the English merchants a significant advantage over their rivals in the Mediterranean carrying trade. Ratifications were also obtained from the sultan of similar treaties with Tunis and Tripoli. And Winchilsea carried out with enthusiasm his instructions to encourage all good Christians within his province, and to mediate between them as well as on their behalf with the Ottomans; Transylvanian, Wallachian, and Moldavian princes, Greek and Armenian patriarchs, Latin bishops in the archipelago, and Franciscan guardians of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem all sought and received his help. He was largely successful in preventing English shipping from being commandeered by the Ottomans for their war with the Venetians in Candia (Crete), although his offers to mediate were not taken up.<br>
<br>Winchilsea's other major contribution was in exerting his authority, strengthened by the Levant Company's new charter of 1661, to re-establish discipline in the English factories in the Levant, where fraud and other abuses had become endemic during the civil wars and interregnum. Cloth exports and silk imports, both vital to English manufacturing industry, returned rapidly to their former levels and soon eclipsed the Dutch trade, which had dominated the scene on his arrival. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War the English government at his suggestion extended its convoy system to ensure that these valuable cargoes were protected by frigates throughout their voyage. The Levant Company acknowledged that Winchilsea had done more for them than any previous ambassador, although this did not stop them from lecturing him about the expenses he had incurred in implementing the king's instructions in terms which he found extremely galling.<br>
<br>&#145;Like a slave used to his chaines, I doe resolve not to change for the worse untill my debts are payd and my children provided for&#146;, Winchilsea told a cousin in 1667  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 1.459), but soon found his plans doubly frustrated by the clandestine marriage of his teenage heir, William, and his own recall. He left Turkey in March 1669 and in April stopped briefly in Sicily to see the lava flow from Mount Etna, which had erupted the month before. His eyewitness account, in the form of a letter to the king from Naples, together with other material supplied by his host in Catania, was published in London later that year as <span class="italic">A True and Exact Relation of the Late Prodigious Earthquake and Eruption of Mount Aetna</span>, and several times reprinted.<br>
<br>Winchilsea's embassy had been an acknowledged success, and he began to lobby for another post in a hot climate: preferably in Italy, but Turkey again, Portugal, Spain, Morocco&#151;even the governorship of Tangier would do. That he never held another overseas appointment he put down to ill will on the part of his cousin Heneage Finch, the future lord chancellor and first earl of Nottingham. He travelled abroad privately instead, with his third wife, Catherine (1649/50&#150;1678), daughter of Sir Thomas Norcliff of Langton, Yorkshire, and widow first of Christopher Lister and second of Sir John Wentworth, whom he had married on 10 April 1673; they went on an extended trip to France and Italy in 1676 and Winchilsea continued east himself in 1677 for a surprise visit to his old friend Consul Rycaut at Smyrna, where one of his own illegitimate children was being raised. He might have retired permanently to Italy before his fourth marriage&#151;by licence dated 29 October 1681 to Elizabeth (1661&#150;1745), daughter and heir of John Ayres of London&#151;but for his responsibilities at home.<br>
<br>In local politics Winchilsea still had an important role which he took seriously. His second wife's brother-in-law, Lord Treasurer Southampton, had kept his lord lieutenancy of Kent warm for him from 1662 until Southampton's death in 1667. Winchilsea was reappointed in 1668, but jointly (to his dismay) with the third duke of Richmond. Richmond, however, died in December 1672, and the following month Winchilsea became sole lord lieutenant (and also vice-admiral of Kent until December 1687). From 1675 to 1683, during the minority of the sixth duke of Somerset, he also held the lord lieutenancy of Somerset. He was clearly regarded as a safe pair of hands, and indeed was active in mobilizing support for the king during the exclusion crisis of 1679&#150;81, the Rye House plot of 1683, and Monmouth's rebellion in 1685, after his reappointment by James II. But he was always a staunch Church of England man, and was among the royalist Anglicans purged by James from the lieutenancy. Then on 12 December 1688, when the king made his first attempt to escape and was detained by the fishermen at the Queen's Arms in Faversham, he heard that Winchilsea was in the neighbourhood and sent to him for help. The earl arrived that night and provided a more suitable guard and lodging. But he welcomed James's successful second attempt, voting in the Convention that the throne was vacant and should be offered to William and Mary. They restored him as lord lieutenant and <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Kent, and in August 1689 William ordered him a pension of &pound;500 a year for life. Already ill, Winchilsea died on 28 August before he could receive the first payment and was buried on 4 September in the family vault at St Mary's Church, Eastwell. Of his twenty-seven legitimate children eleven were stillborn or died in infancy, but he had devoted his best years to providing for the others. In his official capacity he was successful, yet in his own terms he was perhaps a failure. He died so heavily in debt that his widow and daughter-in-law fell out over the sparse furnishings of his house, and only their consent to arbitration by the second earl of Nottingham prevented his marriage bed from being sawn in two. In 1729, on the death without children of the last of Winchilsea's sons, Nottingham himself at the age of eighty-two succeeded to Winchilsea's title and estates.<br>
