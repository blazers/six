<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walker,  Richard</span>  (1679&#150;1764), <span class="occ">horticulturist and college administrator</span>, was the son of Robert Walker, of Tanfield, near Ripon, Yorkshire. After school in Tanfield, he was admitted as sizar in Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1703, matriculated in 1704, and graduated BA in 1707. He obtained a fellowship in 1709, proceeded MA in 1710, and was vice-master in 1734&#150;64. From 1744 to 1764 he was Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy. Walker, a friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the master of Trinity, Richard Bentley, played an important part in the long-running battle between Bentley and the fellows of Trinity, in particular, by refusing as vice-master to act on the sentence passed by the college visitor, the bishop of Ely, to deprive Bentley of his post.<br>
<br>Walker was an enthusiastic gardener, and especially interested in growing exotics in his small garden in Trinity, where his hothouse displayed banana, coffee, pineapple, and many other fashionable foreign plants. He clearly felt that the university lacked a garden and associated regular botanical instruction, and on 16 July 1760 purchased a 5 acre plot of land, including the &#145;Mansion House&#146; to provide lecture rooms, on a central site on which an Augustinian friary had once stood; he conveyed this land to the university on 25 August 1762 in trust &#145;for the purpose of a public Botanic Garden&#146;. In a pamphlet by him published anonymously in 1763 and entitled <span class="italic">A Short Account of a Late Donation of a Botanic Garden to the University of Cambridge</span>, Walker made clear his design, referring to the fact that &#145;we have generally had titular Professors of Botany, but nothing worth mentioning left behind them&#146;, and the first &#145;Statute or order&#146; of his new garden states that &#145;by making use of the plants grown there, trials and experiments shall be regularly made and repeated, in order to discover their virtues, for the benefit of mankind&#146;. In contrast, he states: &#145;Flowers and Fruits must be looked upon as amusements only; though, as these do not want their excellences and uses, they need not be totally neglected&#146;.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Walker's death in 1764 cut short his enthusiastic promotion of the new garden, but his bequest provided for two salaried posts, a reader on plants and a curator; to the first of these posts he appointed Thomas Martyn, who had just succeeded his father John Martyn as professor of botany; the curator's post was filled by Charles Miller, brother of Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden. Walker died on 15 December 1764, unmarried, in Cambridge. The &#145;Walkerian garden&#146;, inside which the university built its first scientific laboratory in 1787, laid the foundation for the great development of science on the &#145;New Museums site&#146; between Bene't Street and Downing Street. His name is perpetuated in the Walkerian Society run by the horticultural students in the botanic garden on its present site.<br>
