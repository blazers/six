<span class="headword">Ramsay,  Andrew</span>  (1574&#150;1659), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Fettercairn, the youngest son of David Ramsay of Balmain, Kincardineshire, and Katherine Carnegie, daughter of Sir Robert Carnegie of Kinnaird, Perthshire. He was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, whence he graduated MA. In common with many of his contemporaries Ramsay continued his schooling in France, where he studied theology. Latterly he occupied a professorial chair at the University of Saumur. An accomplished scholar, he published <span class="italic">Oratio</span> (1600) and <span class="italic">Paraenesis et orationes de laudibus academae Salmuriensis</span> (Saumur, n.d.) during his stay on the continent. He had returned to Scotland by 1606, when he was appointed minister of Arbuthnott, in the presbytery of Fordoun. Probably soon afterwards he married Marie Fraser; the couple had four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23075/', "Andrew Ramsay (1620?&#150;1688)")</script>, later burgess and lord provost of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Ramsay supported royal policy regarding the kirk, and was soon involved in religious controversy. He was appointed constant moderator of the presbytery of Fordoun, and in that capacity voted for the establishment of episcopacy in Scotland at the general assembly of 1610. On the authority of John Spottiswoode, archbishop of St Andrews, he was rewarded with a call to the ministry at Edinburgh in 1613, and was installed at the parish of Greyfriars on 28 April of the following year. He was named burgess of the city (&#145;gratis&#146;) in 1615, and on 21 October of the same year was a member of the newly formed court of high commission (renewed on 15 June 1619). Despite his apparent conformity Ramsay (along with fifty-four others) appended his signature to the &#145;protestation for the liberties of the Kirk&#146; of 1617, an action which frustrated James VI's plans to undermine the power of the general assembly. Following a personal audience with the king, however, Ramsay withdrew his protest. Consequently he retained the favour of James. He was appointed to the chair of divinity at the University of Edinburgh in 1620, and was subdean of the Chapel Royal in 1629.<br>
<br>Unsurprisingly, while Henry Guthrie, bishop of Dunkeld, knew him as a &#145;guid, modest, learned [and] godlie man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 1.70), presbyterian nonconformists took a dim view of Ramsay's support for episcopacy. His sole aim&#151;according to the exiled minister David Calderwood in 1623&#151;was to gain preferment by &#145;amazing the sillie people with griek &amp; latine, [thereby] tickling the ears of the learned sort [and] flattering princes&#146;  (Calderwood, &#145;Answere&#146;, fol. 46<i>r</i>). There was some substance to these allegations, as Ramsay's preaching was widely regarded as tending towards Arminianism. In 1633 he was &#145;severely censured&#146; by his brother-in-law, Sir John Carnegie, and Alexander Henderson, minister of Leuchars, for having adopted &#145;the modish Laudean doctrine of England&#146;  (Wodrow, fol. 12<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). At the same time Ramsay was openly courting the patronage of William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury. His renowned <span class="italic">Poemata sacra &hellip; et epigrammata sacra</span> (a collection of Latin verse written in the style of Ovid) was published at Edinburgh to coincide with the coronation of Charles I, at which Laud was present. The work was highly commended by the contemporary Latinist Arthur Johnston, a client of the archbishop, who later reprinted the poems as part of a wider collection entitled <span class="italic">Deliciae poetarum Scotorum</span> (Amsterdam, 1637).<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his attempts to cultivate the patronage of Canterbury, Ramsay was passed over for the newly created bishopric of Edinburgh in 1634. Neither was he preferred during the extensive reshuffle of Scottish bishoprics&#151;masterminded by Laud&#151;which continued into the following year. Disillusioned, Ramsay's immediate thoughts were of &#145;dimitting his ministry and retiring to his own lairdship&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). By 1637, however, he had sided with the nonconformist ministers of the capital, and&#151;on the occasion of the riot at Edinburgh on 23 July&#151;refused to read the service book from his pulpit. Subsequently Ramsay preached vehemently against the adoption of the new liturgy and canons, and successfully urged his congregation to sign the national covenant in February 1638. In <span class="italic">A warning to come out of Babylon &hellip; preached at the receiving of Mr T. Abernethie, sometime jesuite, into the church of Scotland</span> (Edinburgh, 1638), he demonstrated his own adherence to the covenant. Thereafter Ramsay supported the presbyterian administration in Scotland, and was moderator of the general assembly of 1640. In 1646 he was appointed rector of the University of Edinburgh, a position he held until 1648. In that year, however, he was accused of acting to the prejudice of the government, largely because of his refusal to preach against the engagement with Charles I. The decision to prosecute Ramsay over the issue was not unanimous. The presbyterian diarist Robert Baillie, for example, &#145;could not voyce to depose a man of such age and parts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 3.92). Nevertheless, he was deprived of his ministry by the general assembly of 1649, and he retired to the family estate of Abbotshall, Fife. Later, in 1649, he composed an apology in which he objected to some of the innovations introduced into the kirk since 1638. His disapproval extended to all forms of set prayer in public worship, but especially the Lord's prayer; the repetition of the creed at baptism; and the practice whereby ministers knelt for private prayer on entering the pulpit. On 8 November 1655 the synod of Lothian&#151;on account of his &#145;age and great esteem for piety and learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)&#151;voted in favour of his reinstatement, but he took no further active role in kirk affairs. Ramsay died at Abbotshall on 30 December 1659, and was buried there.<br>
