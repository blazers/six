<span class="headword">Fairlie,  Robert Francis</span>  (1830&#150;1885), <span class="occ">civil and mechanical engineer</span>, was born in Glasgow on 5 April 1830, the son of T. Archibald Fairlie, an engineer, and his wife, Margaret McCall. He gained practical experience of locomotive design and construction at Crewe and Swindon. His first appointment was in 1853 as engineer and general manager of the Londonderry and Coleraine Railway, but he did not stay long in Ireland before accepting a post with the Bombay and Baroda Railway of India.<br>
<br>By the early 1860s Fairlie had returned to Britain and set up in business at 56 Gracechurch Street, London, as a railway consultant. On 5 January 1862 he married Eliza Ann (1844?&#150;1907), daughter of the well-known New Cross builder of small locomotives, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46359/', "George England")</script>. The couple had five children. According to his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary, Fairlie had been married once before.<br>
<br>In 1864 and 1865 Fairlie patented his ideas for an articulated locomotive intended to meet the problems of railway operation in mountainous areas, with sharp curves and steep gradients, at the same time reducing the need for heavy expenditure on civil works and permanent way. He was not the first to consider this concept, but earlier experiments in the United States and Belgium had not been successful, and Fairlie led the way in arriving at a practical solution. His first locomotive type consisted of two powered bogies pivoted at each end of a frame, which carried the boiler, together with fuel and water supplies. The boiler had two barrels back-to-back, with a central firebox and cab, and smokeboxes at the outer ends. Thus, the whole of the weight of the fuel and water, as well as that of the locomotive, was used for adhesion, while the pivoting of the bogies afforded a flexibility which a long fixed wheelbase could not provide. Initial difficulties in steaming were resolved by the provision of separate fireboxes, and problems in providing suitable steam and exhaust connections to the cylinders were also overcome.<br>
<br>The first two locomotives built under the patents were for the Neath and Brecon Railway in 1865 and the Anglesey Central Railway in 1866. They were constructed by J. Cross of St Helens, Lancashire, who also built three locomotives for Queensland, Australia, which were, however, rejected because of defective construction and working. After this inauspicious start, the order for a double engine by the Ffestiniog Railway Company, placed with George England in September 1868, marked an important turning point. This was delivered in August 1869 from Hatcham ironworks, which was, by that time, being run by Fairlie and partners as the Fairlie Engine and Steam Carriage Company.<br>
<br>
<i>Little Wonder</i>, as the locomotive was called, was designed to haul slate trains on the 1 ft 11&frac12; in. gauge Ffestiniog Railway in north Wales, a hilly line with tortuous curves. At several sets of trials it demonstrated its capacity to haul much heavier loads than previous locomotives. Its performance demonstrated the practicability of low cost narrow gauge railways to carry substantial loads in difficult country, a principle which was extended to many parts of the then developing world.<br>
<br>Modifications of the original design were introduced in later years, some with single boilers and others featuring one powered and one trailing bogie. Many were built for overseas railways, notably in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Russia. On the Moscow and St Petersburg line &#145;Fairlie's Railway&#146; was so successful that the tsar had a special gold medal struck in Fairlie's honour. The concept was also taken up in America by the Mason Machine Works of Taunton, Massachusetts, who built some 150 locomotives known as Mason&#150;Fairlies between 1871 and 1889, all except the first being to the single boiler design. Later, construction was carried on by the American Locomotive Company until 1914.<br>
<br>Around the turn of the century attention began to be centred on the Kitson&#150;Meyer and Beyer&#150;Garratt types of articulated locomotive, in which steam for the powered bogies was supplied by a single large boiler; later Fairlie designs, known as &#145;Modified Fairlies&#146;, had many points of resemblance to these. Eventually, some fifty-two railways were to see Fairlie locomotives, which continued to be built into the 1920s, notable examples being three for Mexico, turned out in 1911 and weighing 138 tons.<br>
<br>From 1870 onwards Fairlie secured orders for patent locomotives for railway development all over the world. However, he was more than a locomotive engineer, and offered a comprehensive design and construction package, including rolling stock, generally featuring his type of locomotive. He advocated narrow gauge lines (but of wider gauge than the Ffestiniog Railway) permitting the use of sharp curves and steep gradients. In 1872 he published <span class="italic">Railways or No Railways</span>, which developed his ideas. By the early 1870s Fairlie's business had become a design agency called the Fairlie Engine and Rolling Stock Company, with its locomotives being built by the Vulcan Foundry, the Avonside Engine Company, and Yorkshire Engine Company to virtually standard designs. Fairlie was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 1857&#150;72.<br>
<br>In December 1873 Fairlie was commissioned to undertake a number of railway projects in the republic of Venezuela. He suffered sunstroke soon after landing at Trinidad, and this was followed by jungle fever while surveying the marshes near Puerto Cabello. Fairlie returned to Britain, but his health never fully recovered. However, he continued his business, selling patent locomotives.<br>
<br>Fairlie died at his London home, Woodlands, 13 Church Buildings, Clapham, on 31 July 1885. His business interests were continued by his children, three of whom made their lives in Peru and Chile. One of them, Frank Archibald Fairlie, was locomotive superintendent of the Nitrate Railways (1911&#150;20) and, as such, had the care of locomotives built to his father's designs.<br>
<br>Fairlie's contribution to the development of the steam locomotive lay in the application of basic principles to a novel form of construction. His ideas were later improved upon but, on a number of railways in hilly terrain, his designs lasted until the steam locomotive itself was replaced by diesel or electric traction.<br>
