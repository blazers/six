<span class="headword">Ogilvy, Sir  Alexander</span>, first baronet, Lord Forglen  (<em>d.</em> 1727), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second son of George Ogilvy, second Lord Banff, and his wife, Agnes, only daughter of Alexander Falconer, first Lord Halkerton. In 1685 Ogilvy was accused by Sir Alexander Forbes of Tolquhoun of having taken from Forbes's house a silver mazer, or cup, and sued for its value, but it transpired that Forbes had forgotten that he had earlier taken the mazer to a goldsmith for repair. Forbes was subsequently fined 20,000 merks for this defamation of Ogilvy's character, half as a penalty, which was subsequently remitted, and half as compensation to Ogilvy, which he was obliged to pay.<br>
<br>Although there is no record of his legal training, Ogilvy was described as an advocate when he was appointed deputy keeper of the signet on 22 February 1699. In the same year he was appointed warden of the Royal Mint. On 4 June 1701 he was created a baronet, and he sat in the Scottish parliament as commissioner for the burgh of Banff in 1702 and in 1703&#150;7. In 1703 he and Lord Belhaven were ordered into custody for having quarrelled and come to blows in the parliament house in the presence of the lord high commissioner. On 30 June, having admitted their offence, they were to be freed, but had to await the king's pleasure; Lord Belhaven was fined &pound;5000 for having struck Ogilvy, the additional order that he should ask pardon on his knees having been dispensed with. Ogilvy was appointed to the council of trade in 1705, and in 1706 was a commissioner for the Union, which he warmly supported in parliament.<br>
<br>On 23 July 1706 Ogilvy was appointed a lord of session, with the title Lord Forglen, and later that year he was made a privy councillor. With his first wife, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1663), eldest daughter of Sir John Allardice of Allardice, Kincardineshire, he had four sons and four daughters. There were no children from his second marriage, to Mary (1656&#150;1748), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16486/', "David Leslie, first Lord Newark")</script>, and widow of Sir Francis Kinloch of Gilmerton. He died on 3 March 1727, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his grandson Alexander Ogilvie.<br>
