<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Atwell,  (Una) Winifred</span>  (<em>c.</em>1913&#150;1983), <span class="occ">pianist and entertainer</span>, was born on 27 April <i>c</i>.1913 in Jubilee Street, Tunapuna, near Port of Spain, Trinidad, the only child of a chemist, Frederick Monroe Atwell (<i>d</i>. 1958), and a district nurse, Sarah Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1962). Winifred began playing the piano at the age of four and within a couple of years she was giving Chopin recitals at charity concerts. As a young woman she worked in her father's chemist shop, and he insisted that she took a degree in pharmacy. However, in her spare time she entertained friends and continued to take part in charity concerts.<br>
<br>After performing in Trinidad's Services Club during the war, Winifred went to New York to study piano technique with the celebrated classical pianist Alexander Borovsky. In 1946 she went to Britain, determined to become a concert pianist, and studied at the Royal Academy of Music. She supported herself by working in the evenings playing the piano in dance-halls and clubs. On 9 June 1947 she married Reginald (Lew) Levisohn, a variety artiste who gave up his stage career to become her manager. Encouraged by Lew, Winifred turned her attention to playing ragtime music and became one of Britain's most popular entertainers.<br>
<br>Winifred's breakthrough came in 1948 at a charity concert at the London Casino. She was almost completely unknown before the curtain rose but, after captivating the audience with her ragtime music, she found herself taking several curtain calls. In 1951 she signed a contract with Decca, and in 1952 she appeared in the first royal variety performance for the new queen, Elizabeth II. To a rapturous reception Winifred closed her act with &#145;Britannia Rag&#146;, a number she had composed specially for the occasion and which reached number five in the pop charts.<br>
<br>In the bleak post-war years a party was not complete without Winifred's records being played, and they sold in their millions. In 1954, when she topped the British pop charts with &#145;Let's have another Party&#146;, she became the first black recording artist to reach number one. By 1954 she had also become the first artiste from Britain to have three million-selling hits: &#145;Black and White Rag&#146; (1952), &#145;Let's have a Party&#146; (1953), and &#145;Let's have another Party&#146; (1954). Between 1952 and 1960 she had no less than eleven top ten hits and at the end of the twentieth century she was the most successful female instrumentalist ever to have featured in the British pop charts. At the peak of her popularity her hands were insured at Lloyds for &pound;40,000&#151;a vast sum in the early 1950s&#151;and her fan club had more than 50,000 members. She was also one of the few entertainers to have their own television series on both the BBC and ITV.<br>
<br>Winifred never made a secret of the fact that her heart lay with classical music. Despite her success with ragtime music, she never lost sight of her original ambition to become a concert pianist. In 1954 her exquisite recording of the eighteenth variation from Rakhmaninov's <span class="italic">Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini</span> reached number nine in the pop charts. On 28 November 1954 Winifred packed the Royal Albert Hall as a soloist, accompanied by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, playing Grieg's piano concerto and George Gershwin's <span class="italic">Rhapsody in Blue</span>.<br>
<br>Though Winifred attempted to keep up with a new trend in popular music&#151;rock and roll&#151;it hastened the end of her career in the charts. Also, by the mid-1950s, she faced competition from other successful (white) pianists, including Joe &#145;Mr Piano&#146; Henderson, Russ Conway, and Mrs Mills. However, she was one of the most successful and beloved entertainers of her time, as well as the first Caribbean artiste to become a household name in an era when black performers in Britain had more chance of success if they were American.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Winifred Atwell's carefree, happy-go-lucky records were always being played. In the severity of the post-war years she was one of Britain's most successful and best-loved entertainers. Her warm personality and glamour were just what the British public needed, and she was always consistent, rarely attempting to do anything outside her speciality. Audiences knew what to expect from her, and she never let them down.<br>
<br>By the 1960s tastes in popular music had changed rapidly and Winifred's manic style of piano playing, with its famous &#145;tinny&#146; bar-room sound, went out of fashion. Happily, Winifred had become well known abroad. Her first Australian tour in 1958&#150;9 lasted thirteen months. Her popularity with Australian audiences was so great that, when her record sales began to fall in Britain, she emigrated to that country with her husband. Winifred never completely recovered from the death of Lew in 1978. Three years later she became an Australian citizen; she died from a heart attack in Sydney on 27 February 1983.<br>
