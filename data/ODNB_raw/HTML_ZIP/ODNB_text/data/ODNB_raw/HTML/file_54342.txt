<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hapgood,  Edris Albert <span class="st"> [Eddie]</span></span>  (1908&#150;1973), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born on 24 September 1908 at 4 Clark's Buildings, Union Road, Bristol, the ninth of the ten children of Henry Charles Hapgood (1869&#150;1939) and his wife, Emily Clark (1870&#150;1945). Both parents were from humble west country families. For some fifteen years Henry Hapgood had worked in Wales as a miner, before returning to Bristol shortly before the birth of Edris Albert.<br>
<br>Eddie Hapgood was educated at the Emmanuel and (later) Hannah More schools in Bristol. From the age of fourteen he worked as a milkman at his brother-in-law's dairy, playing football in local leagues. Rejected by Bristol Rovers, in 1926 he joined Kettering Town of the southern league, at that time a &#145;nursery&#146; club for Arsenal Football Club. The following season he signed for Arsenal, a club which, under the managership of Herbert Chapman, was emerging as a leading force in English football. Arsenal's success in the 1930s, which brought five league championships and three cup final appearances, was based on Chapman's strategy of sound defence and rapid counter-attack. Hapgood, as left full-back, played a key role in this system. Of average height and medium build, a non-smoker and teetotaller, he relied upon exceptional speed, precision in the tackle, excellent positional sense, and, despite his height, outstanding heading ability. He always strove for a high level of physical fitness, encouraged by Arsenal's advanced training methods. In the Arsenal defensive formation the full-backs provided cover for the &#145;stopper&#146; centre-half, and in this role Hapgood shaped a new style of full-back play which contrasted with the crude physical methods employed by many full-backs of his day. His technique was to manoeuvre his opponent away from dangerous positions, dispossess with a well-timed tackle or interception, and set up an attack with a shrewdly placed, often short, pass. He rarely used the shoulder charge. His method was acknowledged by his most redoubtable opponent, the Stoke City and England right-winger Stanley Matthews, whose threat Hapgood contained more effectively than most: &#145;[Hapgood] could give and take a pass; a classic player, one of the first footballing full-backs&#146;  (Miller, 35). His method became the benchmark by which future generations of full-backs set their standard.<br>
<br>Hapgood possessed a strong self-belief which shaped both his domestic and professional life. On 16 November 1929 he married the twenty-year-old Margaret Ada (Mig), daughter of William Henry Althorpe, a works foreman, whom he had met in Kettering. They established a comfortable middle-class home in Finchley, where they brought up four children, to whom Hapgood was devoted. Encouraged by Mig's concern for financial security, he capitalized on his fame, supplementing his footballer's maximum wage by advertising chocolate bars and gentlemen's fashions. Socially he rarely mixed with fellow footballers. Chapman had perceived leadership qualities in him from an early stage, and made him captain of Arsenal in 1930, the season in which the club won its first league championship. He retained the post after Chapman's death in 1934, despite cool relations with the new manager, George Allison.<br>
<br>In 1933 Hapgood was selected for England and in November 1934 the Football Association (FA) appointed him captain of the national team. In his sportsmanship, moral probity, and dignified demeanour he exhibited much of the old amateur ethos still favoured by the FA. His first game as captain was the &#145;battle of Highbury&#146;, an ill-tempered match against the world champions, Italy, which tested his strength of character. A broken nose forced his temporary withdrawal from the field but, in the era before substitutions, he returned to lead his team to victory. He remained England's captain throughout the 1930s, and played thirty times. Stanley Rous, the secretary of the FA, wrote:<blockquote>When talking to those who join the ranks of the professionals&#151;an honourable calling&#151;I always stress that they should strive to behave on and off the field as a model on which young players can mould their play and conduct. That Eddie Hapgood has done. (Hapgood, 8)</blockquote>None the less, he was a man of principle, not given to subservience. In the politically sensitive match against Germany in Munich in 1938, when the FA was prevailed upon by the Foreign Office to require the England players, as a mark of goodwill to Germany, to give the Nazi salute before the kick-off, Hapgood expressed his opposition on the grounds that English teams should not be expected to participate in local political customs. Overruled, he consoled himself with his team's crushing 6&#150;3 win.<br>
<br>Though Hapgood continued to play in club, international, and services football during the war, when the league resumed in 1946&#150;7 he felt he had reached retirement age. In any event, Arsenal's failure to pay the full long-service benefit he considered was owed to him led to his leaving the club. At a time of limited career prospects for professional footballers he moved into club management, first with Blackburn Rovers, then (after a brief resumption as a player with Shrewsbury Town) with Watford and Bath City. Each club enjoyed some success under his leadership but his achievements as a manager fell far below his success as a player. He refused to comply with some of the established practices at his clubs and he made enemies, especially among directors. His leaving of Bath City in 1956, amid acrimony and litigation, marked the end of his managerial career.<br>
<br>In 1944 Hapgood published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Football Ambassador</span>, which sold well and went into a second edition in 1951. However, without independent means or a job in middle age he took employment as warden of a YMCA hostel for apprentices at the atomic energy research establishment, Harwell. He was deeply grateful to the organization for this post, but nevertheless considered it less than his due, and resented being unable to continue in football. He enjoyed excellent health throughout his life but at the age of sixty developed heart trouble which forced an early retirement to Leamington Spa. He suffered a fatal heart attack while attending a sports forum at Honiley Hall, Warwickshire, on 20 April 1973.<br>
