<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pynchon,  William</span>  (1590&#150;1662), <span class="occ">public official and pamphleteer in America</span>, was born on 26 December 1590 at Springfield, Essex, the son of John Pynchon (<i>d</i>. 1610) and Frances Brett (<i>bap</i>. 1590). As the child of a wealthy gentry family he was taught Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, but there is no evidence that he attended university. In 1624 he married Anne Andrew (<i>d</i>. 1630/31), with whom he had at least four children. Active in the Massachusetts Bay Company since its planning, Pynchon sailed to New England in the Winthrop fleet in 1630, and was the leading citizen of Roxbury at its founding in the same year. His wife died during the winter of 1630&#150;31 and by 1632 he had married Frances Sanford (<i>d</i>. 1657), widow successively of men named Smith and Sanford. There were no children from his second marriage. Pynchon had been elected to the office of assistant prior to his arrival in the colony and continued in the post until 1636 and served again from 1642 to 1650. He was also treasurer from 1632 to 1633. <br>
<br>In 1636, at a time when hundreds of residents of Massachusetts Bay were moving to the Connecticut River valley, Pynchon headed a group of residents of Roxbury and other Bay communities to the site of what would become the town of Springfield. The town was initially considered to be part of the new colony of Connecticut, but in 1641 Pynchon was able to switch Springfield's allegiance back to Massachusetts Bay. As Springfield was the most westerly Massachusetts Bay town, Pynchon could count on little regular oversight from the Bay authorities, and so had far more power in his settlement than did other magistrates in closer proximity to Boston. Active in the fur trade along the rivers near Boston since his time in Roxbury, and with Springfield the northernmost settlement on the Connecticut River for the better part of two decades, Pynchon was able to obtain complete control over the fur trade over a wide swath of northern New England. The account books maintained by his son John are of central importance for our knowledge of the early history of western Massachusetts. Pynchon also acted as magistrate in the courts in this part of Massachusetts, and again the court records kept by William and his son are extremely valuable. In addition to his powerful position in political and economic affairs, Pynchon held very strong religious opinions of the puritan strain, but not in complete agreement with what had become the orthodoxy of New England. In 1650 he published <span class="italic">The Meritorious Price of our Redemption</span>, a work which controverted the Calvinistic view of the atonement. The general court declared the book heretical and ordered it to be burnt, and Pynchon was made to recant: <blockquote>It hath pleased God to let me see that I have not spoken in my book so fully of the prize and merit of Christ's sufferings as I should have done &hellip; But now at present I am inclined to think that His sufferings were appointed by God for a farther end, namely as the due punishment for our sins by way of satisfaction to divine justice for man's redemption. (<span class="italic">ANB</span>)</blockquote>Not surprisingly, he was not elected assistant in 1651, and in 1652 he returned to England, settling in Wraysbury, Buckinghamshire. Making his contribution to the political and religious atmosphere of 1650s England, Pynchon continued his pamphleteering throughout the decade, his next work, published almost immediately upon his arrival in England, being <span class="italic">The Jewes Synagogue</span>. In 1654 he wrote a detailed work on the sabbath, describing its ordination and true limits. He died in Wraysbury on 29 October 1662 leaving a substantial estate, which he distributed among family and friends in both old and New England.<br>
