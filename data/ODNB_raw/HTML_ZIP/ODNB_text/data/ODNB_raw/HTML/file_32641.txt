<span class="headword">Crookshank,  Harry Frederick Comfort</span>, first Viscount Crookshank  (1893&#150;1961), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Midan Bab-al-Louk, Cairo, Egypt, on 27 May 1893, the only son and first child of Harry Maule Crookshank (1850&#150;1914), a physician and surgeon, and director-general of the Egyptian prisons administration, who was created pasha in 1890, and his wife, Emma Walraven (<i>d</i>. 1954), daughter of the American businessman Samuel Comfort. In 1897 Crookshank Pasha was made controller of the Daira Sanieh administration; he retired in 1907. After his father's death in March 1914 Harry, his mother, and his sister, Betty, continued as one household, from 1937 at 51 Pont Street, London.<br>
<br>After two years at Summer Fields School, Oxford, Crookshank went to Eton College in 1906. At Eton, where he was a king's scholar, Crookshank excelled in most areas with the exception of games. In 1912 he went up to Magdalen College, Oxford. Owing to a weakness in Greek he narrowly missed a first in honour moderations in 1914. Following in the footsteps of his father he became a passionate freemason, joining the Apollo Lodge as soon as he arrived in Oxford.<br>
<br>In summer 1914 Crookshank was studying in Germany, and narrowly escaped internment. On repatriation he volunteered for the Hampshire regiment but soon transferred to the Grenadier Guards. In August 1915, while serving with the 2nd battalion, he was buried alive by the explosion of a mine in an orchard near Givenchy. In October 1915, as he prepared to go out on a wiring party, he was shot in the left leg by a German sniper. He rejoined his unit in August 1916. He commanded the battalion's Lewis guns at the attack on Lesb&#339;ufs on 15 September 1916, when he was seriously wounded by a shell explosion. He returned to active duty between September 1917 and June 1918 at Salonika as aide-de-camp to General Charles Corkran, head of the British military liaison mission to the Serbian army.<br>
<br>In February 1919 Crookshank sat the Foreign Office examination, passing with ease. In October 1920 he was offered a permanent commission in the grenadiers. Despite his own desire to return to the army the Foreign Office refused to release him. In 1921 he was posted to the high commission in Constantinople. In September 1922 he was co-author of a pro-Turkish memorandum that was considered by the cabinet. In the following month he refused to entertain the visiting Ramsay MacDonald. The Chanak crisis convinced Crookshank that important decisions were made by politicians rather than by diplomats. In September 1924 he was adopted as candidate for Gainsborough, Lincolnshire; he won the seat in the general election held in the following month, and retained it until 1956.<br>
<br>Crookshank soon established himself as a Commons &#145;character&#146;. He was thought closely to resemble William Shakespeare, was a natty dresser, and was drawn to quixotic affairs. His first parliamentary set piece was an attempt to wreck a government bill relieving MPs from seeking re-election when they became ministers. He was also associated with the parliamentary revolt in 1927 against the revised <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. In the early 1930s he served as Sir Austen Chamberlain's representative to the League of Nations Union. He was parliamentary under-secretary at the Home Office from July 1934 until June 1935, when he was appointed minister of mines. &#145;Promotion of course,&#146; he recorded, &#145;but just about the least pleasant department and one in which I start with no interest at all&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Crookshank papers). Nevertheless, in December 1935 he persuaded the miners and mineowners to agree on a pay deal. His &#145;whole-hogging&#146; <span class="roman">Coal Bill</span>, which aimed to give the state extensive control over the industry, was, however, howled down in the House of Commons in May 1936. At the end of 1937 the bill was re-introduced; although it became law its provisions were overtaken by the outbreak of war.<br>
<br>Crookshank considered resigning from the government when Anthony Eden was forced out of the Foreign Office in February 1938. He had a private meeting with Neville Chamberlain to express his qualms at the direction of British foreign policy but agreed to remain in office. He did submit his resignation over Munich. Following another private meeting, however, Chamberlain persuaded him to withdraw that resignation. In December 1938 his private criticisms of Leslie Hore-Belisha were leaked to the press, and he apologized to Chamberlain for becoming involved in the so-called &#145;under-secretaries plot&#146;. In April 1939 Crookshank was transferred to the Treasury as its financial secretary, in peacetime a plum job but in wartime a backwater.<br>
<br>Crookshank's combination of carping and caution meant that he was trusted by neither Chamberlain nor Churchill: he voted with the government in the Norway division in May 1940. In February 1942 Churchill asked him to go to the Lords as minister of works. Believing this to be a deliberate insult (the wounds he had sustained at the Somme precluded his fathering an heir to the peerage), he refused. In May 1942 Churchill offered him the post of minister resident in West Africa; this offer too he turned down. In December 1942 he accepted the office of postmaster-general, in war little more than a sinecure. Churchill declined to offer him a senior position in the administration he formed in May 1945: they viewed each other with mutual dislike. It was to 51 Pont Street that James Stuart was summoned in 1947 to hear demands for Churchill's resignation from a group of senior Conservatives.<br>
<br>For Harry Crookshank the Conservative election d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of July 1945 was most fortuitous. He was first and foremost a House of Commons performer and the Conservatives badly needed such talents in opposition. He made a number of high profile attacks on left-wing ministers such as Bevan, Strachey, and Shinwell. He enjoyed his greatest success in exposing the government's incompetence in securing food supplies, particularly the gullibility of ministers in dealing with the Peronist tyranny in Argentina.<br>
<br>Crookshank entered the cabinet in October 1951 as minister of health and deputy leader of the House of Commons. He had little interest in the health portfolio and his tenure was not considered a success. In May 1952 he became lord privy seal and leader of the House of Commons. His transition into full-time parliamentary management was not altogether smooth, and he was criticized for allowing the <span class="roman">Steel Bill</span> to be counted out. He continued to search for opportunities to unseat Churchill. In July 1954 he led a walkout of ministers from the cabinet in response to Churchill's decision to build a British H-bomb after consultation with selected ministers only. He supported Lord Salisbury when the latter accused the prime minister of deliberately flouting constitutional norms in his pursuit of a summit with the Soviet Union. Churchill subsequently failed in his attempt to persuade Harold Macmillan to replace Crookshank as leader of the house. In the end it was Anthony Eden, in whom Crookshank had invested much hope for advancement, who sacked him in order to install R. A. Butler as leader of the house at the end of 1955. In compensation Crookshank was offered a seat in the cabinet as deputy leader of the House of Lords: he accepted the peerage (he was created a viscount in January 1956) but refused further political office. He was appointed CH in 1955.<br>
<br>Although his career was not lacking in worldly success Harry Crookshank remained disappointed in his own progress. Even in the freemasons, who had installed him as a provincial grand master in September 1954, he felt he might have risen higher. His career testifies to the declining importance of the House of Commons as a power base, though his own propensity to be troublesome to the party leadership without ever sticking to a principle and resigning, retarded his own political advancement.<br>
<br>Following the death of his sister in 1948 and of his mother in 1954, Crookshank was a lonely man. He established the Crookshank lectures at the Royal College of Radiologists in his sister's memory. He too was to be killed by cancer. The whiff of scandal was brought to his door in 1958 when his lover was adopted, then ejected, as prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for Grimsby at a time when Conservative anxieties about homosexuality in the party were particularly acute. Crookshank died at his London home on 17 October 1961. As he had since 1960 been high steward of Westminster, his funeral took place in Westminster Abbey; he was buried in Lincoln Cathedral, where a simple plaque is his memorial.<br>
