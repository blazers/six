<span class="headword">Kent,  Elizabeth</span>  (1790&#150;1861), <span class="occ">botanist and writer</span>, was born in Brighton on 13 March 1790, a younger daughter of Ann Kent, court milliner. Nothing is known about her father; when Bessy (as she was known at home) was thirteen her widowed mother married Rowland Hunter, a bookseller in St Paul's Churchyard. Although she had only a dame-school education, Elizabeth Kent had clear intellectual interests, and studied languages and botany. The marriage of her older sister Marianne to Leigh Hunt brought her into lifelong contact with the Romantic writers, including Mary Shelley. She was Hunt's confidante and later his principal correspondent during Hunt's stay in Italy, 1822&#150;5; his sonnet &#145;To Miss K.&#146; (1818) asks &#145;what sylvan homage would it please your Leafyship to have?&#146; Until 1836 she lived with her mother and stepfather, where, she later recalled, she passed much of her time in writing.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Kent combined her literary and botanical interests by writing about plants, producing books and essays meant to excite an interest in flowers among those who were otherwise &#145;deterred by the terms of science which met them at the threshold&#146;. <span class="italic">Flora domestica, or, The Portable Flower-Garden</span> (1823, 1825) is an engaging book about container-gardening. Addressed to town-dwelling &#145;lovers of nature&#146;, it lists flowers, shrubs, and small trees that can be grown in pots and tubs, gives horticultural tips about soil, cultivation, and watering, and includes anecdotes on topics such as the introduction of species into Europe. Kent cites many verses by classical and contemporary poets, including Keats, Shelley, and Charlotte Smith. Her book represented the contemporary Romantic suburban aesthetic, and was widely praised by Byron, Coleridge, and Clare. In <span class="italic">Sylvan Sketches, or, A Companion to the Park and the Shrubbery</span> (1825), a compendium of information about trees and shrubs, she celebrates plants because &#145;there is something beyond mere use, something beyond mere beauty, in their influence upon the human mind&#146;. Her chapter on the maple tree, for example, successfully blends botany and poetry by surveying different species of <i>Acer</i>, describing North American sugaring (tapping sap from the sugar maple to make syrup), and interpolating verses from Virgil, Sidney, Cowper, and Clare.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Kent also integrated botany into her other activities. She wrote a series of introductory articles for young people on Linnaean botanical nomenclature and systematics in the <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> (1828&#150;30), and advertised lessons for young ladies &#145;in the science of botany&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Aug 1828). She wrote a section on botany in <span class="italic">The Young Ladies' Book</span> (1829), and updated Galpine's <span class="italic">Synoptical Compendium of British Botany</span> (1834) and Irving's <span class="italic">Botanical Catechism</span> (1835). Other writing included a book of tales for children, reviews for J. C. Loudon's <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> during the late 1820s, and many unsigned articles and reviews for Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">Indicator</span> (1819&#150;20) and <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> (1830&#150;32).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Kent was left without provision after the death of her mother and the failure of Hunter's business in 1836. She worked as a governess from 1837 to 1846, and received a legacy of &pound;300 from her employer, Mr Bind. This was followed by a period of illness and an unsuccessful attempt to establish a seaside home for young invalids at St Leonards. By 1849, with impaired sight, she was dependent on friends &#145;of that class having more mind than money&#146;  (Kent to Royal Literary Fund, 1855). She applied to the Royal Literary Fund for assistance in 1855, and detailed her &#145;extreme privation&#146; and &#145;delicate circumstances&#146;. She endeavoured to support herself as a writer, but found herself &#145;a stranger in the literary world&#146;. A second application, in 1858, records a fruitless attempt to interest a publisher in a manuscript about &#145;a visit to the principal watering-places on the southern coast&#146; with botanical information. Leigh Hunt supplied testimonials about her &#145;impoverished circumstances&#146; and &#145;high respectability&#146;. At the time of her last application, in 1860, Kent was living with her nephew Thornton Hunt and his large family at 39 Bedford Street, Strand, with no money for clothing, laundry, and medicine. She died in 1861.<br>
