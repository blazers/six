<span class="headword">Bowes,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1383&#150;1444), <span class="occ">lawyer and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, came from a minor gentry family established by 1200 at Costock in south Nottinghamshire. The son of John Bowes (<i>d</i>. in or before 1404) and an unknown mother, he was the first of the family to enjoy a career of any distinction, probably owing his early advancement to his neighbour Sir Thomas Rempston (<i>d</i>. 1406), in whose wardship he was brought up. Nothing can be said of his early years except that he trained as a lawyer, and that his career began in earnest in 1422, when he was added to the quorum of the peace in his native shire, a position he retained (with one short interval) until his death. He soon numbered among his professional clients members of several of the leading gentry families of both Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, and in the latter county acquired a small estate at Frisby on the Wreak through his marriage to Margaret Friseby (<i>d</i>. 1444/5).<br>
<br>Bowes served as royal escheator for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire from November 1428 to February 1430, was occasionally appointed to commissions, and was four times returned to parliament as a knight of the shire for Nottinghamshire, in 1429, 1432, 1435, and 1439. His third election brought him to the high point of his career, when he was chosen to be speaker of the Commons. To outward appearances an unlikely candidate for this office, he may have benefited from a general predisposition in favour of lawyers (he was one of eight to become speaker in successive parliaments between 1432 and 1447), from contacts with such powerful figures as William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, and Ralph, Baron Cromwell, and from the agitation that was then surrounding the payment of the ransom of Sir Thomas Rempston (<i>d</i>. 1458), son of Bowes's early patron and one of the leading English commanders in the last phase of the Hundred Years' War. Bowes had already been involved in an unsuccessful attempt to raise the ransom, and it is likely that, as speaker, he was the sponsor of petitions presented in this parliament on Sir Thomas's behalf. But if those petitions help to explain his appointment, Bowes's work as speaker also found favour with the king's council: on 16 December 1435, a week before the dissolution, he was paid &pound;13 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. as reward for expediting royal business, probably the satisfactory grant of taxation made by this parliament. This is the earliest known example of a payment by the crown to the speaker specifically in return for his services in that office, and no more were made until after the accession of Edward IV, when they became common practice.<br>
<br>Thereafter Bowes continued to practise as a lawyer, and his career prospered to the extent that on 13 July 1440 the corporation of London chose him as its recorder&#151;the city's principal legal officer. It was as recorder that two years later he served as one of the city's MPs. But just as his hitherto only modestly successful career might have been about to bring him greater rewards, he appears to have been afflicted by a sudden illness. On 20 June 1442 he made his will, and on 14 July he was replaced as recorder by Robert Danvers, on the grounds of infirmity. By way of compensation the London authorities granted Bowes a pension of 20 marks (&pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.). He was still alive on 26 July 1444, when he witnessed an important deed, but had died by 4 August following, when his will was proved at York.<br>
<br>Bowes's will is unrevealing, and does not even specify a place of burial. It does not suggest that he had profited greatly from his work as a lawyer, perhaps because significant promotion came only very late in a career that had been slow to develop. In the income tax returns of 1436 he was assessed on an annual income of only &pound;26, and given the meagreness of his patrimony and of his wife's inheritance, it is likely that a significant part of this income came from annuities. He had no recorded children, and his estates passed to his brother William.<br>
