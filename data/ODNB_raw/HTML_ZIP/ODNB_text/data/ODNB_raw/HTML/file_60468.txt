<span class="headword">Scott,  Alexander Mackie</span>  (1920&#150;1989), <span class="occ">poet and scholar of Scottish literature</span>, was born on 28 November 1920 in a two-roomed cottage at 13 Western Road in the Woodside suburb of Aberdeen, the only child of Alexander Mackie Scott (1894&#150;1976), a power-loom tuner, and his wife, Magdalina Cheyne (1895&#150;1988), daughter of Robert Adams and his wife, Elizabeth. His parents were both Scottish; his forebears were craftsmen and farmers from the rural north-east of Scotland.<br>
<br>While Scott was at the Kittybrewster primary school in Aberdeen, he began to imitate stories he found in children's comic magazines. Between 1932 and 1935 this led to his creating in longhand his own weekly magazine, complete with serial stories and hand-drawn illustrations. In the tales he devised, fantasies of buccaneers, detectives, and &#145;redskins&#146; were juxtaposed with versions of the English public-school life depicted by Frank Richards and others. These last retained their interest for him (he was working on a study of Richards before he died). He also wrote much verse in English following Romantic and Victorian models. &#145;The Red Planet Calling Red Circle&#146; was his first publication, appearing in the <span class="italic">Hotspur</span> (13 July 1935) while he was at the Aberdeen central school. When he entered Aberdeen University in 1939, Scott was not only writing copious amounts of poetry but had attempted a novel, and was writing anti-war stories and dramatic sketches as well as material for school and undergraduate reviews. He started to read contemporary poetry while a first-year undergraduate, and discovered Burns during summer 1940.<br>
<br>In autumn 1939 Scott joined the Peace Pledge Union, but his pacificism crumbled in the crisis of Britain's isolation at the beginning of the Second World War; he was not called up until November 1941. He was commissioned in the Royal Artillery but transferred to the Gordon Highlanders. He landed on D-day with the 5th/7th Gordon Highlanders. Wounded at the battle of Falaise Gap in August 1944, he returned to duty and won the Military Cross for his conduct in leading a company attack during the battle of the Reichswald Forest on 8 February 1945. He married Catherine Goodall (<i>b</i>. 1920), a schoolteacher, on 10 May 1944. They had two sons, Crombie and Ewan.<br>
<br>After the war Scott returned to Aberdeen University to complete his degree in English language and literature, and graduated in 1947 with first-class honours. Scott's commitment to Scottish literature developed during the later years of the war: an unpublished poem suggests that he was reading Hugh MacDiarmid in barracks in Germany before being demobbed, and his concluding post-war years as an undergraduate consolidated his knowledge of Scottish verse through the ages. He began writing verse in Scots during the war, and thereafter wrote in both Scots and English; he claimed that the choice of language for a new poem was dictated by the language of the first line which came to him.<br>
<br>While completing his degree, Scott was briefly an editor of the <span class="italic">North-East Review</span>, an Aberdeen-based literary journal in which some of his earliest published poems appeared. This was the first of his several editorships of small magazines, a field in which his contribution was individual, important, and distinguished. He was offered, but refused, a scholarship to Merton College, Oxford. His first academic employment was as assistant lecturer in English at the University of Edinburgh (1947&#150;8), but within a year he was a lecturer in Scottish literature at the University of Glasgow, and he lived in Glasgow for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Scott's first collection of poetry, <span class="italic">The Latest in Elegies</span>, appeared in 1949, and thereafter he was seen as one of a group of poets sometimes referred to as the Lallans Makars, associated with MacDiarmid's programme for a nationalist literary revival. A brief <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> followed in 1950. <span class="italic">Mouth Music</span> came out in 1954 but he wrote few poems in the mid-1950s, and apparently none at all between 1957 and 1965. His impulse to write was subject to hiatuses which he found distressing.<br>
<br>Much of Scott's creative energy in the 1950s was directed towards drama. The short comedy <span class="italic">The Last Time I Saw Paris</span> won a Festival of Britain award for verse drama in 1951, and several other plays gained him lesser awards in the 1950s. In all, seventeen plays can be traced, many written for radio. Most are in Scots, several in verse. Three are full-length stage plays and were produced by the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre. They include <span class="italic">Right Royal</span> (produced in 1954) with which he had a notable success. Later Citizens' productions of his work were less successful, though still attractive to popular audiences. He turned away from the stage, however, believing that commercial theatre in Scotland no longer provided sufficient encouragement for distinctively Scottish drama.<br>
<br>Scott returned to poetry from the mid-sixties until the early 1980s, when his poetry petered out again. His work from this period includes <span class="italic">Cantrips</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Selected Poems, 1943&#150;1974</span> (1975). One of his most frequently anthologized poems is &#145;Coronach&#146;, written in memory of fallen comrades on the second anniversary of D-day. It is characteristic of him in its use of Scots to combine terse, tough manliness with tender emotion. It is, however, uncharacteristic of him in being a war poem: this successful soldier wrote surprisingly few poems reflecting his wartime experiences, and allowed only a few of those poems to see print. Among his generation of Scottish poets he was one of the most craftsman-like, producing poems reflecting a care for traditional features of sound and form. He presents himself in many of his poems in Scots as a downright, plain-speaking common man who nevertheless is compassionate towards the follies and sufferings of humankind. He is also seen as placing a premium on intellectual and aesthetic values. His characteristic voice leans towards the satirical and the humorous, perhaps best exemplified in &#145;Scotched&#146;, the famous sequence of tersely hilarious two-line squibs evoking typical Scottish attitudes on a medley of topics, such as &#145;Scotch Passion&#146;. Many of his best poems are satirical or critical responses to aspects of life and popular culture after the 1950s. On the other hand, he produced love poems of great tenderness. Most of his virtues as a poet are found in his long and subtle poem on his native city, &#145;Heart of Stone&#146;, the writing of which brought him a new creative impetus in the mid-1960s.<br>
<br>As an academic Scott contributed immensely to the emergence of Scottish literature as a subject in universities and schools (he was made the first head of the department of Scottish literature at Glasgow in 1971). His major contribution to research came early in his career. His work on the poet William Soutar was particularly important. He produced an edition of Soutar's diaries, <span class="italic">Diaries of a Dying Man</span> (1954), and a study of the poet, published in 1958. He also produced selected editions of the poems of his own sixteenth-century namesake (1952), and one of the poems of William Jeffrey (1951). He was a gifted anthologist, and at different stages in his career edited important small journals, including <span class="italic">The Scots Review</span> (1950&#150;51) and <span class="italic">The Saltire Review</span> (1954&#150;8). He was joint editor of <span class="italic">The Scottish Review</span> (1980&#150;85) and <span class="italic">New Writing Scotland</span> (1983&#150;6). He was skilled in spotting talent in emergent writers, and his encouragement and nurturing of these were not the least of his contributions to the literary life of Scotland. His vigorous-minded critical comment found regular outlet in the press and on radio. Above all, he was a memorable university teacher, inspiring generations of students, several of whom became academics in Scottish literature.<br>
<br>Alexander Scott was tall and striking in appearance, his strong features crowned by a profusion of long hair which he never lost. His forceful personality and strong opinions made him a powerful presence in committees, and his energy and commitment were decisive in establishing a number of fledgeling literary and academic projects throughout his career. His combativeness was both valuable and a drawback: in the small world of Scottish literary and cultural politics he made some enemies. It may also have contributed to his failure to be awarded a personal chair; his university rank was that of reader when he retired.<br>
<br>In 1977 Scott was diagnosed as suffering from emphysema, which gradually worsened; he retired as head of department in 1983. He died of lung cancer on 14 September 1989 at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, and was cremated at Maryhill on 16 September. He was survived by his wife. His ashes were scattered in the O'Dell Garden, King's College, Aberdeen, on 2 December. A large collection of poetry, &#145;Incantations: Poems and Diversions&#146; was unpublished at his death; it was incorporated into the <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> (1994). Much unpublished and uncollected verse remains. Despite his intermittent career as a poet, he remains, nevertheless, one of the leading poets in Scotland to build on Hugh MacDiarmid's achievement.<br>
