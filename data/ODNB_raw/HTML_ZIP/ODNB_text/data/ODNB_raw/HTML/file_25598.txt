<span class="headword">Sims,  James</span>  (1741&#150;1820), <span class="occ">physician</span>, possibly the son of the Revd Samuel Sims, a dissenting minister, was born in co. Down, Ireland, and after a preliminary education went to study at Leiden, where he proceeded MD in 1764, presenting as his inaugural thesis &#145;<i>De temperie foeminea et morbis inde oriundis</i>&#146;. He then returned to Ireland, and after practising for nine to ten years in co. Tyrone, moved about 1773 to London, where he was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1778.<br>
<br>Sims was greatly assisted by John Coakley Lettsom, and soon acquired a lucrative practice. In 1774 Sims was appointed physician to the General Dispensary in Aldersgate Street (established by Lettsom) and also served as physician to the Surrey Dispensary. He was the first chairman and vice-president of the Philanthropic Society. The Humane Society, too, owed much of its early success to his energy. Sims also became an honorary fellow of the New York and Massachusetts medical societies. He joined the Medical Society of London in 1783 and from 1786 he served for twenty-two years as its president. As his presidency progressed he became less popular, but was dislodged only by the strenuous exertions of the younger fellows, such as Astley Cooper and William Babington, some of whom had already left to form the Medical and Chirurgical Society. Sims had a valuable collection of books, which by an unusual arrangement he made over to the Medical Society in 1802, provided that an annuity of &pound;30 be paid to himself and his wife, and &pound;45 annually to the survivor. He made a sufficient fortune to allow himself to retire in 1810 to Bath, where he died in 1820.<br>
<br>William Wadd described him as &#145;a good-humoured pleasant man, full of anecdote, an ample reservoir of good things, and for figures and facts a perfect chronicle of other times. He had a most retentive memory; but when that failed, he referred to a book of knowledge, from which he quoted with oracular authority&#146;.<br>
<br>There is a good portrait of Sims painted by Samuel Medley (1769&#150;1857). It was engraved by Nathan Branwhite, and issued as a folding plate in the third volume of J. C. Lettsom's <span class="italic">Hints Designed to Promote Beneficence, Temperance, and Medical Science</span> (1801).<br>
<br>Sims's works are: <span class="italic">Observations on Epidemic Disorders, with Remarks on Nervous and Malignant Fevers</span> (1773), which went into a second edition in 1776 and was translated into both German and French; <span class="italic">A Discourse on the Best Methods of Prosecuting Medical Enquiries</span> (1774), a critique of current methods in anatomy, which was translated into French and Italian; and <span class="italic">Observations on the Scarlatina anginosa, Commonly called the Ulcerated Sore Throat</span>, which appeared in several editions between 1796 and 1803. Sims also completed and corrected Edward Foster's <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Midwifery</span> (1781).<br>
