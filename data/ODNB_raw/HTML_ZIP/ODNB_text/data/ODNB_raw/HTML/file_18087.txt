<span class="headword">Marras,  Giacinto</span>  (1810&#150;1883), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 6 July 1810 at Naples, the son of the Cavaliere Giovanni Marras and his wife, Maria Biliotti, a famous Florentine beauty. His father was court painter to the grand duke of Tuscany and the sultan of Turkey, and was himself a son of the Roman poet Angelica Mosca. In 1820 Giacinto entered the preparatory school of the Real Collegio di Musica at Naples. Shortly afterwards, probably on account of his success in the soprano part of Bellini's first opera, <span class="italic">Adelson e Salvini</span>, performed in the college theatre, for which he was chosen by the composer because of the beauty of his voice, he was elected to a free scholarship at the college, where his masters for composition and singing were Niccol&ograve; Zingarelli and Girolamo Crescentini, and Bellini and Michael Costa were sub-professors. While studying in Naples he sang in and wrote music for the city's churches.<br>
<br>On leaving the college Marras made a professional tour through Italy, and in 1835 he was invited by the marquess of Anglesey and the duke of Devonshire to visit England. He was immediately engaged for most of the important concerts, including those of the Philharmonic Society and the Ancient Concerts. In 1842 he made a concert tour of Russia, and he had such success at St Petersburg that Tsar Nicholas offered him the post of director of court music, which he declined. He later sang in Vienna, Naples, and Paris.<br>
<br>In 1846 Marras settled permanently in England, and he was naturalized on 12 January 1850. In 1855 he turned down an offer of the principal professorship of singing at the Royal Academy of Music, and was later elected an honorary fellow. About 1860 he started his Apr&egrave;s-midis Musicales at his house at 10 Hyde Park Gate. Between 1870 and 1873 he made a successful tour through India, and in 1879 he went to Cannes and Nice, where he made his last public appearances. In 1883 he left Cannes for Monte Carlo for change of air, after a severe attack of bronchitis, and died at the H&ocirc;tel de Londres, Monte Carlo, on 8 May 1883. He was buried at Cannes in the protestant cemetery, close to the memorial to the duke of Albany. He had married his pupil Lilla Stephenson, daughter of a major in the 6th dragoon guards, and they had one daughter, later Madame Schulz, who became a singer.<br>
<br>During his long career Marras made many operatic tours with performers including Fanny Tacchinardi-Persiani, Jeanne Castellan, and Jan Pischek, and he sang the leading tenor parts in most of the Italian operas then in vogue. He was equally at home in oratorio and chamber music. As a teacher of singing he was much in demand, and among his pupils were the duchess of Cambridge, Princess Mary of Cambridge, and the grand duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. He composed more than a hundred songs, mainly in Italian. His <span class="italic">Lezioni di canto</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">Elementi vocali</span> (1850) were important contributions to the art of singing, for which the king of Naples sent Marras a gold medal. Marras also composed an opera, <span class="italic">Sardanapalus</span>. Though never publicly performed, it met with considerable success when given privately at Lord Dudley's house, Witley Court.<br>
