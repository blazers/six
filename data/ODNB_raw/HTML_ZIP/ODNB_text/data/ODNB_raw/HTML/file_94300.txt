<span class="headword">Calle,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1503), <span class="occ">administrator and land agent</span>, was the son of a shopkeeper from Framlingham in Suffolk. Nothing more is known about his family except that he had at least one brother. Framlingham was the seat of the Mowbray dukes of Norfolk, and it was thanks to a personal recommendation from the third duke that Calle was taken into the service of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52791/', "Paston family")</script>, gentry from north Norfolk. No details of his experiences before he entered Paston employment, nor the precise date at which he joined their household, can now be recovered. However, the survival of the Paston letters (twenty-six of which were composed by Calle, and eight others written by him at the dictation of members of the family) means that much more is known about his life and career than is the case for most contemporaries of his modest status.<br>
<br>Calle first appears in the Paston correspondence in the mid-1450s. It is clear from the letters that he was an intelligent man who had been educated to a high standard of literacy and numeracy, and he turned his hand to an impressively broad range of duties. He shouldered the principal responsibility for the management of the Paston estates&#151;arranging leases, collecting rents, organizing the sale of agricultural produce, and drawing up detailed financial accounts&#151;and advised his employers on commercial, agricultural, and political matters. When the Pastons became embroiled in a complex battle to inherit the valuable estates of Sir John Fastolf after the latter's death in 1459&#151;a campaign in which their difficulties were compounded by the civil war which resulted in the deposition of Henry VI and the accession of Edward IV in 1461&#151;Calle was entrusted with sensitive legal and political errands, and was sometimes required to put his own safety at risk to protect Paston interests. In the autumn of 1462, for example, he worked closely with John (III), the second son of the family, to fend off the incursions of a rival claimant at the Fastolf manor of Cotton in Suffolk, and was arrested and briefly imprisoned as a result. It is clear that by this stage Calle was one of the most trusted retainers within the Paston household, and that the family depended heavily on his competence and counsel.<br>
<br>However, that trust was shattered, and his expertise lost to the Pastons, in 1469. Just when the fourth duke of Norfolk's challenge for a share in the Fastolf estates was precipitating a terrifying political crisis for the family, they suffered a blow nearer home when it emerged, to their horror, that Calle and Margery Paston (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1450) [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/61168">Calle,  Margery</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/52791">Paston family</a>], elder daughter of John (I) Paston, had fallen deeply in love. The relationship seems to have begun in secret two years earlier, but was discovered in April 1469 by Margery's widowed mother, Margaret. The Pastons' objection to the match was not the difference in the couple's ages&#151;Calle was probably in his mid-thirties, and Margery about twenty&#151;but the disparity in their status: &#145;he should never have my good will for to make my sister to sell candle and mustard in Framlingham&#146;, her brother John (III) wrote angrily  (<span class="italic">Paston letters and papers</span>, 1.541). Despite this vehement opposition, in the late summer of 1469 Calle and Margery became formally betrothed, albeit in secret. When the family discovered what had happened, Calle was banished to London and Margery kept under watch in her mother's home. One of Calle's letters&#151;gracefully composed and intensely moving&#151;has survived from this period of separation: &#145;we that ought of very right to be most together are most asunder; me seemeth it is a thousand years ago since that I spoke with you&#146;  (ibid., 2.498).<br>
<br>Margery was no less determined, refusing to renounce her vows even when interrogated by Walter Lyhert, bishop of Norwich, on 8 September. As a result, the union could not be annulled, and a few weeks later the couple were reunited at Blackborough nunnery near King's Lynn, where Calle took employment as the convent's receiver. A public ceremony of marriage seems to have followed. It seems that Margery was never fully reconciled with her mother and brothers, but, for the pragmatic Pastons, Calle's experience and loyalty&#151;which never wavered, despite their rejection of him as a prospective son- and brother-in-law&#151;were too valuable to lose permanently. By 1472 he was back in their service, although he did not regain the position of trust he had previously enjoyed.<br>
<br>Calle was eventually able to buy an estate at Bacton in north-east Norfolk and establish his own household there. With Margery he had three sons, William (who probably became a friar), Richard, and John, the eldest, to whom Margery's mother Margaret left &pound;20 in her will in 1482. It is possible that Margery herself had died by then. Certainly Calle outlived her, for at an unknown date he married Margaret, daughter of Sir Andrew Trollope and of Elizabeth Mundeford, whose brother Osbert was an old friend and relation by marriage of the Pastons. Calle and his second wife had at least two sons, Anthony and Andrew. It is not known when Calle died, but he was still alive in the spring of 1503.<br>
