<span class="headword">Strecche,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1407&#150;1425), <span class="occ">Augustinian canon, historian, and antiquary</span>, of St Mary's Priory, Kenilworth, was in 1407 presented to the custody of the <i>cellula</i> of Broke in Rutland, a cell of Kenilworth. He resigned this office in 1425 and returned to his mother house. He was a compiler and copier of texts as well as author of a chronicle and of other texts, and two volumes survive that were probably compiled by him. BL, Add. MS 38665 contains five Latin works in his hand, and he was probably author of three of them: verses against the Augustinian friars; a <span class="italic">Cronica cuisdam amici veritatis in argumentum fundacionis canonicorum regularium ordinis sancti Augustii</span>, which forms a reply to the work of an Augustinian friar claiming priority for his order over that of the Augustinian canons; and a treatise on the thirty different colours or kinds of rhyming verse, with examples. Two further texts, the <span class="italic">Liber Catonis</span> and Aesop's fables, are in his hand. The remaining texts, which include materials on the Augustinian canons (a list of houses and a chronicle of their general chapters between 1325 and 1350), are not in Strecche's hand.<br>
<br>BL, Add. MS 35295 contains a mixture of his own compositions along with other works of romance and history. The <span class="italic">Historia Trojana</span> of Guido delle Colonne and the <span class="italic">Historia regum Britanniae</span> of Geoffrey of Monmouth are in the hand of John Aston, but Strecche's appears as corrector, and the opening poem on the fall of Troy is in his hand. Strecche was the author and scribe of the <span class="italic">Historia regum omnium Anglorum</span> which concludes the volume. This is divided into five books, preceded by a brief history of England from Brutus to 827 and the story of Albina and her sisters. The first book deals with the early Saxon kings, the second with Alfred and his successors, the third with the Danish kings, and the fourth with kings from the Norman conquest to the usurpation of Henry IV. The fifth book devotes three folios to Henry IV and twenty-four to Henry V, the latter being by far the longest section in the work, and historiographically the most important. It was compiled shortly after 1422, and deals mainly with the French war in typically patriotic tone, including the story of the dauphin's gift of tennis balls, which is also found in Thomas Elmham's <span class="italic">Liber metricus</span>. The desire to eulogize Henry led Strecche to omit any reference to the king's supposedly riotous youth and to misrepresent certain events in the war, playing down, for instance, the defeat at Baug&eacute; in 1421. Although its approach is sometimes anecdotal, the chronicle does include details not found elsewhere, providing the fullest account by any early commentator of Henry's brief visit to England in 1421, during which, as on several previous occasions, the king visited Kenilworth. Strecche has set short pieces of verse by himself and by others throughout his <span class="italic">Historia</span>, and there are frequent references in the text to the priory of Kenilworth. His compilations and compositions provide a useful example of the intellectual tastes and activities of an early fifteenth-century canon.<br>
