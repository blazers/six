<span class="headword">Losinga,  Herbert  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1119), <span class="occ">abbot of Ramsey and bishop of Norwich</span>, was one of the most prominent English ecclesiastical leaders of his time.<h2>
<a name="Origins"></a>Origins</h2>Herbert was born at Exmes, in the old <i>vicomt&eacute;</i> of the Oximin in southern Normandy, the son of Robert de Losinga. Various explanations of his name have been advanced. That it is of Suffolk origins (from Lothingland hundred, Lowestoft) is patently mistaken; and the chronicler John of Worcester's remark that he was called Losinga because of his skill in flattery (<i>lozenga</i> is first recorded as meaning flatterer in 1384) is extremely unlikely, since his father bore the same name. The most likely explanation is that, as in the case of another Robert de Losinga, bishop of Hereford, it is a corruption of Lotharingia, and that Herbert's ancestors had come from that region to Normandy.<h2>
<a name="Herbertscareer"></a>Herbert's career</h2>Herbert entered the abbey of F&eacute;camp, where he rose to the office of prior. William Rufus (<i>d</i>. 1100), soon after his accession, summoned Herbert to England, and in 1087 or 1088 he was appointed abbot of Ramsey. Three years later, on the death of William de Beaufou, he was elevated to the bishopric of East Anglia, recently moved to Thetford, and was consecrated before 27 January 1091, probably on 5 January. There is no doubt that he paid money to the king for his appointment, and for that of his father as abbot of the New Minster at Winchester (subsequently Hyde Abbey)&#151;one source specifies &pound;1000&#151;and thus committed simony, one of the sins most abhorred by reformers who took their lead from Rome. The episode is the subject of an early thirteenth-century wall painting in Norwich Cathedral.<br>
<br>In the next three years there is little information concerning Herbert; he attested three royal charters and was present on 4 December 1093 at the consecration of Archbishop Anselm, who may have had considerable influence on his subsequent decision and actions. On 2 February 1094 the king deprived Herbert of office. The reason for this was the bishop's repentance of his simony and his intention to resign his see into the hands of Pope Urban II who, in a time of schism, was not yet recognized by Rufus. The chronology of events is not absolutely clear, but it seems almost certain that the royal action preceded rather than followed Herbert's visit to the pope, who absolved him and restored him to his bishopric. It is remarkable how quickly he was forgiven and reinstated by the king, but Herbert repaid Rufus by joining all the bishops except Rochester in supporting him against Archbishop Anselm at the Council of Rockingham in February 1095. There is, indeed, no evidence of any further conflict between Herbert and the king or his successor. In 1101 he was dispatched by Henry I as one of the envoys to the papal curia to discuss Anselm's refusal of homage; an embassy disrupted by Herbert's capture for ransom in 1102 by Guy of Lyons, and one which was ultimately hardly a success, since not only did Pope Paschal II fully support Anselm, but the envoys misunderstood his message, and a second delegation had to be sent. When Herbert, with other bishops, wrote to the archbishop urging him to return from exile, this was certainly not done against the king's wishes. Although, again with other bishops, Herbert deplored Henry I's depredations of the church during Anselm's exile, he mentioned his affection for the king in a letter to a close friend, and he corresponded with Queen Matilda, for whom he composed a prayer.<br>
<br>That Anselm did not bear any resentment is suggested by his choice of Herbert in 1108 as his envoy to York to negotiate in the primacy dispute between the two archiepiscopal sees. Herbert attended councils of the English church in 1102, 1108, and 1109, and appears to have supported the archbishop's reforming measures, although after the council of 1102 he told Anselm that pastoral ministry in his diocese would almost come to a stop if all married clergy were to be suspended. On at least five occasions between 1096 and 1115 he was present at the consecration of bishops. He was a prominent figure within the English church, and the abbot of Ely at least hoped that he might emerge as successor to Anselm at Canterbury; it is interesting, however, that Herbert sharply refused the abbot's invitation to become involved in the simmering conflict between regulars and seculars as the champion of the monastic order.<h2>
<a name="EstablishmentofhisseeatNorwich"></a>Establishment of his see at Norwich</h2>In the history of his own diocese, Herbert's most obvious contribution is the removal of the see from Thetford to Norwich and his establishment there of a magnificent new cathedral staffed by a chapter of Benedictine monks. The tradition that the bishop embarked on its construction largely at his own expense as atonement for his simony need not be entirely discarded, as his foundation charter stresses the value of penitence; but it is not in fact necessary to explain the move, which was entirely in accord with the programme adopted by the Norman episcopate as a whole to move their sees to thriving urban centres. Although the removal from North Elmham to Thetford was recent, the church of St Mary there was small and was, moreover, held by the sons of Bishop Herfast, while the great magnate houses of Bigod and Warenne had a strong hold on the two halves of the town. The later tradition is that the establishment of the cathedral at Norwich took place on 9 April 1094, but this is too soon after Herbert's deprivation and probably during his journey to Rome. It is likely, in fact, that the king's permission was obtained in 1095, when a royal commission determined the bounds of the land to be handed over to the bishop in addition to the site of Holy Trinity Church, given to the bishopric by the Conqueror, and now to be demolished. Building probably began in 1096. There was inevitably a period of transition; the church of Thetford was not handed over to Roger (I) Bigod for the establishment of a Cluniac priory until 1103, and for some years Herbert was described as bishop of either place.<br>
<br>By early September 1101 Herbert made reference to the church of Holy Trinity, which he had built and consecrated. This obviously refers to the eastern end of the church, and possibly only the choir. By Herbert's death in 1119 building had progressed probably as far as the fourth or fifth bay of the nave. The building, which substantially survives, was completed under his successor, Everard, and is remarkable both for its scale (a nave of fourteen bays) and for its cosmopolitan sophistication. In essence an ancient Roman basilica, its elaborate decoration broke with the stark simplicity of the first generation of Anglo-Norman Romanesque. Much of the episcopal palace, akin to a miniature keep, was also built by 1119, although the monastic complex was not completed until the late twelfth century. The construction of the cathedral, following on that of the royal castle, totally transformed both the topography and the social structure of medieval Norwich. The liturgy introduced in the cathedral was that of F&eacute;camp, the house of Herbert's profession, and, as the customs of F&eacute;camp were themselves derived from Cluny, Norwich was drawn into one of the great reforming movements of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries.<br>
<br>Bishop Herbert in the initial years made substantial donations to the new community out of the revenues of the bishopric, both on the outskirts of Norwich and further afield in East Anglia. He imposed an aid on the whole diocese, collected in parishes, to finance the programme. He was also careful to obtain the support of both king and pope. Rufus almost certainly charged heavily for land around Holy Trinity Church, but Henry I gave the manor of Thorpe specifically to fund the building, and also granted valuable privileges. The earliest papal document in the Norwich archives is a bull of Pope Paschal II, issued in April 1102, when Herbert was in Rome. This confirmed the founder's own intentions, that a community of monks should for ever be established in the church of Norwich, and that no future bishop should expel them or in any way infringe the rights granted to them by the king and others of the faithful.<h2>
<a name="Developmentofreligiouslifeinhisdiocese"></a>Development of religious life in his diocese</h2>In fact, lay investment in the new cathedral was not lavish. This did not denote lack of enthusiasm for the monastic order, but was rather the consequence of the foundation by the Norman aristocracy of East Anglia of numerous religious houses, which had first claim on the generosity of the tenants of the honours and which were encouraged by the bishop himself. In 1087 the only Benedictine communities in the region were Bury St Edmunds, St Benet of Hulme and the small cell at Rumburgh, and the earliest Norman foundation by William Malet at Eye. Thereafter, before Herbert's death in 1119, communities of French monks were established at Castle Acre (by the Warenne family, 1089), Clare (1090), Binham (Valognes, <i>c</i>.1093), Thetford (Bigod, 1103), Horsham St Faith (Robert fitz Walter and Sybil, his wife, 1103), and Wymondham (d'Aubigny, 1107). The ecclesiastical geography and religious practice of East Anglia was totally transformed and, as the buildings gradually rose, the influence of Herbert's architectural model at Norwich became apparent. His personal influence in this revolution is more difficult to document, as few episcopal charters survive from the period, which still relied largely on oral testimony. There are, in fact, only twenty episcopal <i>acta</i> for an episcopate of twenty-eight years. Hints are given, however, by Herbert's notification that a monastery was being built at Castle Acre in accordance with his wishes, by a reference to his confirmation for Clare, and by the indulgence which he granted to visitors to Horsham St Faith. His awareness of new trends in religion is indicated by his support for the foundation, towards the end of his life, of a house of Augustinian canons at Great Bricett.<br>
<br>Herbert's policy as diocesan bishop was assertive. He continued his predecessors' attempts to undermine the exempt status of the great Suffolk monastery of Bury St Edmunds, albeit ultimately unsuccessfully. He was alarmed by the exemption claimed by Thetford as a daughter house of Cluny, and waged a successful battle to ensure that the body of the founder, Roger Bigod, was buried in the cathedral rather than in his own monastery. The cathedral was intended to be a liturgical model for the diocese, and its influence was extended by the foundation of dependent cells at St Leonard's in Norwich and at Aldeby, Lynn, and Yarmouth; at the last of these, episcopal rights were staunchly defended against the claims of the local citizens. The best evidence for Herbert's aspirations is architectural. He built on a grand scale, modelled on the style of the cathedral, at the new town of Bishop's (now King's) Lynn, at Yarmouth, and at North and South Elmham, to the extent that his architectural programme has been described as a manifestation of &#145;episcopal imperialism&#146;  (Batcock, 188).<h2>
<a name="Hissermonsandletters"></a>His sermons and letters</h2>It is possible to obtain some appreciation of Herbert's character and intellect because of the rare survival of collections of fourteen sermons and fifty-nine letters. The sermons, which were probably delivered to a monastic audience, reveal an encyclopaedic knowledge of scripture and a determination always to extract a moral from the text; Herbert was an expert in allegory. His knowledge of patristic writers may well have been derived from florilegia rather than from profound study of the texts themselves. His theology was generally conservative, and there is little hint of the application of reason to faith, which was the path of the future. His emphasis on the Real Presence in the eucharist is probably the legacy of Lanfranc. In only one instance does his preaching reflect a theological development of his own time; his Marian theology has been described as more advanced than that of any contemporary except Eadmer, and Herbert described himself as &#145;pious client of the Mother of God&#146;  (Alexander, 204). His effectiveness as a preacher, which of course cannot be fully appreciated from the written word, is suggested by an account of how his sermon at Ely at the translation of St &AElig;thelthryth (Etheldreda) in 1107 reduced the congregation to tears.<br>
<br>Many of the letters are addressed to monastic students. They indicate that there was a school of liberal arts at Norwich and that the bishop took a keen interest in the education of oblates. The letters reveal a very traditional Benedictine attitude, compassionate and sensible, rigid in essentials and especially on obedience to the rule, flexible on peripheral matters. Herbert appreciated the dangers and temptations of the celibate life, especially for the young, and understood the difficulties caused by the simultaneous study of both Christian and pagan literature. Most especially, in letters and sermons, he stressed continually the obligation of charity: &#145;the church's poor people are the Body of Christ&#146;  (Alexander, 216), and &#145;alms extinguish sin as water does fire&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life, letters and sermons</span>, 2.27).<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Late in 1116 Herbert set out again for Rome, this time with Archbishop Ralph of Canterbury, who was intent on resolving the dispute with York. He fell ill at Piacenza and returned to Normandy. Thereafter he attracted no notice from chroniclers until his death on 22 July 1119. He was buried before the high altar of his cathedral. It is no longer believed that the episcopal figure set in the north wall of the north transept is Herbert's image from his tomb (probably it rather represents St Felix) but the vestments are of the early twelfth century and its presence here is strangely appropriate. At Norwich the memory of the founder was, naturally, still cherished in the early fourteenth century. More significantly, both Orderic Vitalis and William of Malmesbury, who had fiercely condemned Herbert's simony, believed that by his record as bishop he had atoned for his sin.<br>
