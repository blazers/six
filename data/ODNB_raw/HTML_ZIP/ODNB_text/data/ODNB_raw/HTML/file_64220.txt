<span class="headword">Armour <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Steel]</span>,  Mary Nicol</span>  (1902&#150;2000), <span class="occ">still-life and landscape painter</span>, was born at Blantyre, Lanarkshire, on 27 March 1902, the eldest of six children of William Steel, a metal dresser in the steelworks at Blantyre, and his wife, Jabina Gilbert. She won a scholarship to Hamilton Academy where the art teacher, Penelope Beaton (1886&#150;1963), noticed her; Beaton persuaded Armour's father to allow her to enrol at Glasgow School of Art in 1920. Armour often said in later life that although there were many students at the school from more privileged backgrounds than her own, none had a better basic training in drawing and painting than she had received at Hamilton Academy.<br>
<br>Armour's principal tutor was Maurice Greiffenhagen, assisted by David Forrester Wilson. From Greiffenhagen Armour learned the elements of composition but his own style was at variance with the more painterly handling of many Scottish painters. An early indicator of Armour's straightforwardness of manner is her clash with Greiffenhagen over the subject of her final-year diploma painting. He required that all students should produce a work from the traditional iconography but Armour chose a modern subject, a gathering of women at the pithead. Although she was allowed to complete the painting, she failed to win the final year prize which was undoubtedly her due.<br>
<br>In 1925, after a post-diploma year and teacher training, Mary Steel became an art teacher, working in schools in Glasgow and Cambuslang. In 1927 she married the landscape and figure painter William Armour (1903&#150;1979) and settled in Milngavie just outside Glasgow. At that time married women were not allowed to teach and Armour was forced to resign and take up painting full time in order to earn a living. An attack of peritonitis and subsequent surgery left her unable to have children.<br>
<br>Armour gradually made a name for herself in the 1930s, exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy (where she won the Guthrie prize in 1937), the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, and the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts (RGIFA). In 1941 she was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy and ten years later became a lecturer in still-life painting at Glasgow School of Art. At first a substantial proportion of her students were returning servicemen or others whose careers had been interrupted by the war and they brought with them a youthful enthusiasm for more recent European painting. Armour found herself influenced by their interests and as a result her palette and handling changed, bringing a brightness of colour missing from her earlier painting and a looseness of brushwork.<br>
<br>In 1953 the Armours moved to Kilbarchan, a Renfrewshire weaving village. Mary Armour retired in 1962 and returned to full-time painting but now she found her work in considerable demand. Awards and honours came her way&#151;full membership of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1958, the Cargill prize at the RGIFA in 1972, full membership of the latter in 1977, an honorary LLD from Glasgow University in 1982, and later she was elected honorary president of both the Glasgow School of Art and the RGIFA. Critical and commercial success did little to change Mary Armour, other than facilitate her financial assistance to her siblings, nephews, and nieces. Her patience with students and kindly advice to them, continuing after she had retired from teaching, will long be remembered. It was always given with a straightforward, somewhat impersonal delivery, for Mary Armour was not afraid of plain speaking&#151;a product, she said, of the deprivations and common-sense approach of her north Lanarkshire upbringing. She never lost her sense of humour, even through her last ten years, when she had to give up painting owing to failing eyesight and poor health. Even in her most severe moments a smile or chuckle was not far behind her sternest words of advice or encouragement.<br>
<br>Armour's contribution to the art and artistic life of her era was the celebration of traditional painterly virtues in a manner which made them relevant to the period. She was not an iconoclast or artistic rebel but she realized that traditional qualities still had a contemporary value. After 1950 she translated her early training into a more contemporary manner and provided a route for her students to assimilate her experience. These new paintings proved an immediate success with collectors in Scotland and further afield who valued the craftsmanship and vision of an artist who had been trained in the grand style of the Glasgow School of Art in the 1920s.<br>
<br>Mary Armour died at Paisley on 5 July 2000. Her work is represented in many Scottish public and corporate collections.<br>
