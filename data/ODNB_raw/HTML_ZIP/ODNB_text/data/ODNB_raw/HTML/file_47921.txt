<span class="headword">Bridgeman, Sir  Maurice Richard</span>  (1904&#150;1980), <span class="occ">oil industrialist</span>, was born at 13 Mansfield Street, Marylebone, London, on 26 January 1904, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37223/', "William Clive Bridgeman (1864&#150;1935)")</script>, a Conservative politician who was created Viscount Bridgeman in 1929, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39506/', "Caroline Beatrix Bridgeman (1873&#150;1961)")</script>, a political activist and churchwoman, and elder daughter of the Hon. Cecil Thomas Parker. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58054/', "Robert Clive Bridgeman")</script> was his elder brother. Both parents were of aristocratic birth, W. C. Bridgeman's grandfather being the second earl of Bradford and his wife's grandfather being the sixth earl of Macclesfield.<br>
<br>Maurice Bridgeman was educated at Eton College, where he was captain of the oppidans, captain of the eleven, and president of Pop. He followed in his father's footsteps in going to Trinity College, Cambridge, but where the father had been a classical scholar the son read science and, despite his considerable intellectual ability, left without taking a degree. Eager to join the world of commerce and industry, in 1926 he accepted an offer of employment (at a salary of &pound;5 a week, then the best on offer) with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1935 and the British Petroleum Company in 1954). At that time the company (established in 1909) owned the concession for oil exploration and production in most of Persia and was expanding its operations rapidly.<br>
<br>Bridgeman's first assignment was to accompany as secretary the deputy chairman, Sir John Cadman, to Persia for the shah's coronation. Afterwards he was posted to Persia and spent some time there before recurrent jaundice forced his return to Britannic House, the company's head office in London. In 1933 he married Diana Mary Erica Wilson (<i>d</i>. 1979), younger daughter of Humphrey Minto Wilson. The Bridgemans had a family of four daughters.<br>
<br>Luck and coincidence, Bridgeman said, had twice played an important role in his career, firstly in 1926 when he deputized for Cadman's usual secretary, and secondly in 1934 when he was unexpectedly sent to take charge of the company's New York office. Both appointments brought him, early in his corporate life, close to the centre of events and power. He served in New York for three years and the knowledge of and contacts in the American oil industry that he acquired then were to be immensely useful.<br>
<br>The government controlled the oil industry during the Second World War and from 1939 to 1946 Bridgeman occupied a succession of government posts: in 1939 he was petroleum adviser to the Ministry of Economic Warfare; he was assistant secretary in the petroleum department and joint secretary to the Oil Control Board from 1940 to 1942; a two-year spell as petroleum adviser to the government of India followed; and finally he served from 1944 to 1946 as principal assistant secretary to the petroleum division of the Ministry of Fuel and Power. He was honoured in 1946 when he was made CBE.<br>
<br>Resuming his career with the company after the war, in 1952 Bridgeman was appointed managing director of the company's exploration subsidiary, D'Arcy Exploration Company. He was thus in a most significant position at a critical time in the company's affairs when, in 1951, it lost its concessionary position in Iran, forcing a radical review of the direction of exploration effort. Bridgeman believed that the company must diversify its sources of oil and he was instrumental in directing exploration to other areas, resulting in discoveries in Libya, Nigeria, the North Sea, and Alaska.<br>
<br>Bridgeman was appointed to the main board of British Petroleum (BP) in 1956; he became deputy chairman in 1957 and chairman in July 1960. During his nine years as chairman the company made considerable progress in diversifying its activities, a strategy close to Bridgeman's heart. BP had started to manufacture chemicals in a joint venture with the Distillers Company soon after the end of the war, and in 1967 it bought out Distillers's share; British Petroleum Chemicals then became a wholly owned subsidiary, the second largest chemicals business in the UK. The company also discovered and developed a process which converted oil to protein, forming the basis for a nutrition business. In the USA it began the negotiations which would lead to a considerable presence for BP in that continent, through the acquisition of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio (Sohio)&#151;completed in the time of Bridgeman's successor.<br>
<br>Bridgeman was a consistent and fierce critic of British governments' taxation policies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> both the oil companies and the individual. His aloof manner concealed a keen business sense and he was a tough negotiator. He travelled widely throughout the 1960s, visiting all parts of the company regularly; his kindliness and concern for people won him great respect. Bridgeman's commitment to BP, however, left him little time to pursue his other interests of fishing, gardening, shooting, ornithology, and the arts. Moreover, he considered the chairmanship of BP to be a full-time job and took on relatively few other responsibilities. His long-term interest in the Middle East was reflected in his membership of the Advisory Council on Middle East Trade from 1958 to 1963 and in his acting as president of the Middle East Association from 1956 to 1976. He was chairman of the public appeal to fund the creation of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, in 1962, and the college made him an honorary fellow in 1967; Leeds University made him an honorary LLD in 1969.<br>
<br>Bridgeman was knighted in 1964; he was made a knight of St John in 1961, a knight grand cross of the Italian Republic in 1966, and grand officer, order of Orange Nassau, in 1968. He received the Iranian order of Homayun in 1968 and the Cadman memorial medal in 1969. He retired from BP in 1969 and spent the next two years as a member of the Industrial Reorganization Corporation. After suffering from Parkinson's disease Sir Maurice Bridgeman died of heart failure on 18 June 1980 at 4 Lansdowne Crescent, Kensington, London.<br>
