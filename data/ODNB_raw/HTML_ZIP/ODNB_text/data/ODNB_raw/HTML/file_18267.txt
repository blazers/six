<span class="headword">Mason,  Charles</span>  (1616/17&#150;1677/8), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was reputedly born at Christmas time 1616. He was among at least seven sons of William Mason (<i>d</i>. in or before 1629), an official in the court of king's bench, and his wife, Ann, most of whom were baptized in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Charles's younger brother Benjamin (<i>bap</i>. 1622) was MP for Herefordshire in 1656. Charles himself was educated at Eton College from about 1628. On 10 March 1632 he was admitted a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in early 1636 and proceeding MA in 1639. Chosen as a fellow on 10 March 1635 he was a lecturer in the college from Christmas 1636 to Michaelmas 1639 and proceeded BD in 1642. On 1 November of that year he was created DD of Oxford University. Mason was one of the five fellows of King's College ejected by the parliament in 1644, but was chosen by the college as rector of Stour Provost in Dorset in 1646. His institution was ordered by the Lords on 1 March 1647, and he seems to have retained the living until his death.<br>
<br>On the Restoration Mason was created DD of Cambridge University (1660). On 15 June 1661 he was presented by the king to the rectory of St Mary Woolchurch, London, but the church was destroyed in the great fire of 1666 and the parish annexed to that of St Mary Woolnoth. In 1662&#151;with the support of Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London&#151;Mason petitioned the king for the rectory of Chipping Barnet in Hertfordshire; on 3 September a warrant for his grant was drawn up, but he does not appear to have been instituted. Although, on 31 December 1663, Mason was collated to the prebend of Portpool in St Paul's Cathedral, he wrote in January 1665 to William Sancroft, then dean of St Paul's, complaining of poverty and ill health, and begging for preferment. On 14 May 1669 he was presented to the rectory of St Peter-le-Poer, Broad Street; there, on 27 August 1675, James Fleetwood (<i>d</i>. 1683) was consecrated bishop of Worcester, and Mason arranged the use of a neighbouring hall for the consecration feast. On 15 July 1671 he was installed in the prebend of Beaminster Prima, in Salisbury Cathedral, and in 1675 he was appointed president of Sion College. Mason published several sermons, including <span class="italic">Miles Christianus: a sermon preached to the artillery company, October 16 1673 at St Michael's in Cornhill</span>, in which a preface to Sir John Robinson, lieutenant of the Tower of London, explains that it appeared in print partly because &#145;I am told that my trumpet was not shrill enough to be heard by those at a distance&#146;. Mason held his two prebends and the rectory until his death, which occurred between 22 December 1677, when he made his will, and the grant of probate on 25 January 1678. He left all his property to his wife, Barbara, his two daughters having earlier married.<br>
