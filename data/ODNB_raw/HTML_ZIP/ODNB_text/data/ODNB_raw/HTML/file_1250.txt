<span class="headword">Balsham,  Hugh  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1286), <span class="occ">bishop of Ely and benefactor</span>, took his name from Balsham, Cambridgeshire, one of Ely Priory's manors. Nothing is known of his background, except that during the controversy aroused by his election as bishop it was alleged that he was of servile origins. He became a monk at Ely, and rose to be sub-prior of the monastery. Following the death of Bishop William of Kilkenny, on 21 September 1256, Balsham was elected bishop by the monks. Matthew Paris, characteristically anxious to speak up for monastic liberties and to present Henry III in a bad light, gives a misleading account of the controversy that followed, presenting the king and Archbishop Boniface of Canterbury as working together to thwart the Ely monks and persecute their chosen bishop. Ely was a wealthy see, commonly reserved for one of the king's leading administrators, and Henry was undeniably offended by the convent's action. But the monks themselves declared that they would not resort to litigation if the king objected to their choice. It was Archbishop Boniface who did most to stir up discord, when he tried to bring the election under his own jurisdiction by announcing that he would examine the bishop-elect's suitability. The king's proctors appealed to Rome against the archbishop's action, while the monks asked the pope to investigate Balsham's fitness for office and confirm his election. But Boniface ignored them, and proceeded to declare the election invalid&#151;his purpose in doing so was to promote the career of the celebrated Franciscan theologian Adam Marsh, whom he provided to the see.<br>
<br>At Rome Pope Alexander IV (<i>r</i>. 1254&#150;61), faced with the problem of defining the extent of his own jurisdiction, in an area where it had hitherto been imprecise, decided that any appeal would suffice to bring a disputed episcopal election before the curia; by making this decision Alexander was also ruling that Boniface's actions since the election had been invalid, and thereby secured Balsham in his see. He confirmed Balsham as bishop of Ely on 6 October 1257, and consecrated him on the 14th. Balsham promised that he would in future visit Rome every three years (a pledge from which he was released in 1278) and returned to England. His diocese had meanwhile been extortionately administered by royal agents, and although Henry III accepted the pope's action, and restored the temporalities on 15 January 1258, Balsham subsequently complained that during its vacancy the bishopric had suffered &#145;immense trespasses and damages&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1258&#150;66</i>, 48). It is arguable that he never truly recovered the king's goodwill; he accompanied Henry III to France in October 1259, but enjoyed none of those gifts of timber and venison that marked out those who stood within the magic circle of royal favour.<br>
<br>Between 1259 and 1262 Balsham seems to have been much abroad, perhaps in part because of his promise to make triennial visits to Rome. During the barons' wars his diocese suffered severely, especially after 1265, when the Isle of Ely was occupied by die-hard rebels; in September 1266 he was granted the money he owed for military service &#145;in aid of the recovery of the Isle of Ely and the pursuit and arrest of the king's enemies who hold out there and destroy the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1258&#150;66</i>, 675). Five years later Balsham's own losses were described as &#145;innumerable&#146;. Even so, he was more than once suspected of a lukewarm attitude to the king's cause. In April 1264 it was ordered that his barony be confiscated because of his failure to send the knights he owed to the army mustered to oppose Llewelyn. In the following year he was summoned to Montfort's parliament, and probably attended, since he was subsequently prosecuted in king's bench for &#145;offences against the peace and other transgressions against the king&#146;  (Jacob, 293). He was only occasionally engaged in public affairs thereafter: in 1274 he was ordered to take steps for the defence of Ely, after rumours circulated of an impending attempt by unnamed enemies to occupy it, and he was present in parliament in November 1276 when the king and his councillors resolved to attack Llewelyn. In May of the latter year he was licensed to crenellate his manor of Fen Ditton, suggesting that he enjoyed easier relations with Edward I than with Henry III.<br>
<br>During the twenty-eight years of his episcopate Balsham proved to be an active and determined administrator. At least once he issued synodal statutes. Their chronology is rendered uncertain by the fact of their surviving among three basic recensions of Ely statutes, the earliest of them heavily dependent on statutes issued by Bishop Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln in or about 1239. Balsham was certainly responsible for the third recension, datable to between 1268 and 1276, and very possibly for the second, issued between 1254 and 1268. The relatively small number of statutes unquestionably his record Balsham as dealing with such issues as clerical ignorance and the promotion of the cult of St Etheldreda. In his dealings with his cathedral priory Balsham showed himself concerned to promote up-to-date administrative practices, through the injunctions he issued after a visitation in 1261. The convent had earlier entrusted the management of its finances to two monks, who were charged with submitting an annual account, but Balsham clearly found this inadequate, since he ordered that treasurers be appointed, who were to receive all manorial revenues, and who were henceforth to have overall control of the house's expenditure. He also implemented Archbishop Robert Kilwardby's decree concerning the customary gifts of candles made by the sacrist to all the inhabitants of Ely at Christmas. The growth of the town's population made this a serious burden on the convent's finances, and could no longer be tolerated.<br>
<br>Balsham was meticulous about ordaining vicarages in churches appropriated to religious houses in his diocese, such as the nunneries of Denny and Chatteris. He also licensed the foundation of a chapel at Brame, near Ely, on recently cleared land which would eventually form part of the sacrist's endowment. Direct gifts to the Ely monks included the churches of Foxton and Wisbech St Mary, intended to augment the resources of the monastery's almonry and refectory respectively, and a site for a brewery near the bishop's own fish pond, between the queen's chamber and the monastic bakery. The building of the queen's chamber itself seems to have been provided for in 1277, by a gift of money that was to be paid when the monks built their own stone house; it now survives as the house occupied by the headmaster of Ely School. Nor did Balsham neglect his own episcopal interests. Soon after his consecration he re-established his rights in his see's lodging in the Temple, London. To compensate for his grants to Ely Priory and others he acquired the manor of Tydd St Giles, north of Wisbech, and the advowsons of the churches of Bexwell in Norfolk and of Cherry Hinton and Conington in Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>Balsham was closely involved in the development of the University of Cambridge. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a studium in the town headed by a chancellor, and functioning under the protection and direction of the bishop, many of whose clerks were masters in the schools. It is not surprising, therefore, that in 1276 a dispute about the statutes, and about the claim of the archdeacon of Ely to control the rector of the local grammar schools, should have been referred to Balsham's arbitration. But of greater long-term significance was the licence that Balsham obtained from Edward I in December 1280 for the foundation of a college of &#145;scholars of the bishop of Ely in Cambridge&#146;, modelled on Merton College, Oxford. The scholars were at first lodged in the hospital of St John, which was staffed by Augustinian canons, but the scholars and canons quarrelled, and on 31 March 1284 Balsham transferred the former to two hostels outside the town's Trumpington Gate, and appropriated to the scholars alone the church of St Peter (now Little St Mary's) previously held by the hospital, which was compensated elsewhere. From this grant the college took its name of Peterhouse. Balsham also appropriated to the college the church of Thriplow, and later in the year increased the value of the vicarage by 4 marks. Nevertheless the new college&#151;Cambridge's first&#151;was poor at first. It is likely that Balsham intended to make further endowments; as it was, on his deathbed he bequeathed &pound;200 to Peterhouse, specifically to enable the scholars to build on their site. They are said to have used the bequest to build a new hall.<br>
<br>In the heat of the controversy over his election to Ely Balsham was described by Henry III as &#145;a man inadequate and entirely useless&#146;  (<span class="italic">Close Rolls</span>, 10.108&#150;9). He may have been a somewhat colourless personality, though he showed a degree of humanity in granting the Ely monks permission to wear the copes appropriate to their order so as to protect themselves against the coldness of their church, but of his competence and concern for order there can be little doubt. When he made his will, in July 1279, he procured its sealing at the provincial council held at Reading in the same month. Balsham died at his manor of Dodington, in the Isle of Ely, on 13 June 1286, and was buried on the 24th before the high altar of the cathedral. A brass now in Balsham church is said to represent the bishop.<br>
