<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rothschild,  (Nathaniel Mayer) Victor</span>, third Baron Rothschild  (1910&#150;1990), <span class="occ">zoologist and public servant</span>, was born on 31 October 1910 in Palace Green, Kensington, the only son and second of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76005/', "(Nathaniel) Charles Rothschild (1877&#150;1923)")</script>, banker and naturalist, and his wife, Rozsika (1870&#150;1940), daughter of Captain Alfred von Wertheimstein of Cs&eacute;htelek, a part of Hungary later annexed by Romania. His elder sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94916/', "Dame Miriam Rothschild")</script>, was a noted naturalist and entomologist and his younger sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101125/', "Nica de Koenigswarter")</script>, a patron of American jazz musicians. Their father, Charles, younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35844/', "Nathaniel Mayer de Rothschild, first Baron Rothschild")</script>, took his life in 1923 while suffering from the effects of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). During his days at Harrow School, Victor shone only as a cricketer. It was as an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, that he first revealed an ingenious mind. The university department of zoology was impressed enough to excuse him the long grind of the natural history tripos so that he could at once embark on research. A change of regulation required him nevertheless to sit for a pass degree. In 1935 he was elected to a fellowship at Trinity for work of high promise on the fertilization of frogs' eggs. He obtained a PhD in 1937 and an ScD in 1950.<br>
<br>Much was to be made in later years of Rothschild's membership of the Apostles at Cambridge. Like most of his Cambridge contemporaries, Rothschild was mildly left-wing but never a Marxist. Nor did he share the belief of such Apostles and close friends as Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess that the rise of Nazi Germany demanded uncritical adulation of the Soviet Union. And although he regarded homosexuals with amused tolerance at a time when their practices infringed the criminal law, he was not one himself. He excelled at tennis, golf, and cricket, as a driver of fast cars and a jazz pianist. Like most Rothschilds he was an obsessive collector. He began even as an undergraduate to assemble the finest library in private hands of English eighteenth-century first editions, manuscripts, and book bindings, some 3000 items which he later presented to Trinity. He also pursued silver of the same period and impressionist paintings.<br>
<br>Rothschild married, on 28 December 1933, Barbara Judith (1911&#150;1989), only daughter of St John Hutchinson, barrister. Although Rothschild never subscribed to the beliefs and practices of Judaism, he thought it seemly that his wife should be converted to the Jewish faith. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Succession to the peerage of his bachelor uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35843/', "(Lionel) Walter Rothschild")</script> in 1937 did not alter the rhythm of Rothschild's laboratory life. Refusing to be burdened by possessions or a role in national affairs, he sold the family mansion, no. 148 Piccadilly, together with its plethoric contents, and most of the country estate at Tring. Rothschild spent much of the Second World War in charge of the tiny but effective counter-sabotage section of MI5. The precision with which he had learned to dissect frogs' eggs served him well in the defusing of explosive devices. For dismantling a new type of bomb placed by German agents in a cargo of Spanish onions bound for Britain, he was awarded the George Medal in 1944 after the personal intervention of Winston Churchill. Colonel Rothschild was also responsible for analysing anonymous gifts to the prime minister of food, wine, and cigars in case they concealed poison or explosives. The USA awarded him the legion of Merit and the bronze star.<br>
<br>Rothschild's marriage, exhilarating but precarious, ended in divorce in 1945. He married on 14 August 1946 his assistant in MI5, <a href="#cosubject_63053">Teresa Georgina (Tess) Mayor [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had two sons, one of whom died at birth, and two daughters. Resuming his experiments at Cambridge on fertilization, Rothschild produced much original work on the speed and heat of spermatozoa, and with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40021/', "Michael Swann")</script> discovered how a single sperm, on penetrating the egg of a sea urchin, was able to exclude all others. In 1953 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He published, as well as many papers, <span class="italic">Fertilization</span> (1956) and <span class="italic">A Classification of Living Animals</span> (1961).<br>
<br>Only weeks after Labour's sweeping victory in the general election of 1945 Rothschild formally joined the Labour Party: a mistimed gesture by a rich young patrician that invited cynical comment. He was appointed to several official bodies. As chairman of the Agricultural Research Council from 1948 to 1958 he increased both its budget and its standing. From 1961 to 1970 he was employed by Royal Dutch-Shell, rising to be co-ordinator of research for the entire group worldwide. Shell accustomed him to a customer&#150;contractor relationship, which he believed should also be imposed on government research establishments (even though he had opposed it at the Agricultural Research Council). <span class="italic">A Framework for Government Research and Development</span> (1971) was ill-received by his colleagues in Cambridge laboratories and at the Royal Society, who felt betrayed at the application of payment by results to their work.<br>
<br>The report was the first fruit of the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) set up by Edward Heath in 1971 with Rothschild as its first director-general, to offer the cabinet independent advice on important issues, such as race relations, nuclear reactor policy, Concorde, and coal. Even under the influence of Rothschild's office hospitality&#151;smoked salmon sandwiches and cider cup consisting almost entirely of brandy&#151;permanent under-secretaries could see little merit in a band of intellectual <i>condottieri</i> sabotaging the established procedures of the civil service as they roamed the corridors of Whitehall. He was appointed GBE in 1975.<br>
<br>Retiring from the CPRS in 1974, Rothschild presided over the Royal Commission on Gambling in 1976&#150;8 and published in 1978 an exhaustive report. He was consulted by Margaret Thatcher on the reform of local government finance, but bore no responsibility for the rigidity of the subsequent poll tax introduced by her government. In spite of an aversion to the practice of banking, he was persuaded in 1975 to become chairman of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, and from 1976 to 1988 chairman of Rothschilds Continuation Ltd; he could not, however, heal its internal dissensions or prevent the departure of his son, Jacob Rothschild, to found his own more adventurous merchant bank&#151;an episode that strained beyond repair an already uneasy relationship between father and son. Rothschild himself continued as a director and brought both scientific experience and flair to the chairmanship of its successful subsidiary, Biotechnology Investments Ltd. He had ten honorary degrees.<br>
<br>Byronically handsome in youth, Rothschild acquired a senatorial countenance in middle age. He was an accomplished host, but a guest only on his own terms: no formal clothes, a very small company, and an early night. He gave generously to charities and to individuals, often by stealth, and administered family trusts for the support of the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot and other Israeli causes. He preferred the pen to the telephone. The terseness of his epigrammatic style delighted his friends but was feared in controversy. He wrote, with professional help, two monographs on family history: one on N. M. Rothschild, founder of the English line, the other on Baron Lionel's role in acquiring the Suez Canal shares in 1875.<br>
<br>The carefree friendships of Rothschild's early Cambridge years that had continued throughout the war cast a shadow over the last decade of his life. The defection of Burgess to Russia and the uncovering of Blunt as a Soviet agent exposed Rothschild to innuendo and vilification in press and parliament. Rather than let his name, his courage, and his record of public service speak for themselves, he sought unwisely to clear himself through the testimony of Peter Wright, who as an investigator employed by MI5 had every reason to know of his innocence. Clandestine association with so volatile a character aroused further suspicions that Rothschild had broken the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span>. Only after voluntarily submitting himself to a long interrogation by Scotland Yard did he emerge with honour and patriotism intact. But the ordeal took a toll on both his pride and his health. He died of a heart attack at St James's Place, London, on 20 March 1990 and at his express wish was buried near the tomb of N. M. Rothschild in a long-disused cemetery in Stepney. He was succeeded in the barony by his elder son, (Nathaniel Charles) Jacob Rothschild (<i>b</i>. 1936).<br>
<br>Rothschild's second wife, <a name="cosubject_63053"></a><span class="headword">Teresa Georgina <span class="st"> [Tess]</span> Rothschild</span>, Lady Rothschild  (1915&#150;1996), <span class="occ">counter-intelligence officer and magistrate</span>, was born in London on 10 September 1915, the daughter of Robert John Grote Mayor (1869&#150;1947), civil servant in the Board of Education, and his wife, (Katherine) Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Meinertzhagen (1885&#150;1971), a poet and playwright. She was the granddaughter of Joseph Bickersteth Mayor (1828&#150;1916), philosopher and classical scholar, niece of Flora Macdonald Mayor (1872&#150;1932), novelist, and great-niece of Beatrice Webb (1858&#150;1943), Fabian. At the co-educational Bedales School from 1929 to 1934 she rose to be head girl, then proceeded in 1935 to Newnham College, Cambridge. At university she shone as &#145;the most celebrated actress of her day&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 31 May 1996), and she was part of a left-wing circle of friends that included several of the Apostles. On leaving Cambridge she worked for the publisher Jonathan Cape before being recruited by MI5 as assistant to Victor Rothschild, working on anti-sabotage operations. She was appointed MBE in 1945 in recognition of her bravery in dealing with an unexploded bomb. She worked briefly for Philip Noel-Baker in the foreign office before marrying Rothschild and returning with him to Cambridge. Besides caring for Victor and their children, welcoming her husband's wide range of friends and family, and hosting his dinner parties, she was involved in penal reform, lecturing at the Institute of Criminology, sitting on Home Office boards, and serving as a JP. She kept up her interest in the performing arts, being a trustee of the Cambridge Arts Theatre. She died in London on 29 May 1996, survived by her two daughters, both of whom pursued academic careers, and a son, who entered the Rothschild firm.<br>
