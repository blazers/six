<span class="headword">Oxlie,  Mary</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1616), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is known for a single commendatory poem addressed to the Scottish poet William Drummond of Hawthornden. Her fifty-two-line poem, a striking apologia for female creativity as well as a panegyric, &#145;To William Drummond of Hawthornden&#146;, appeared in the 1656 edition of Drummond's <span class="italic">Poems</span>. It is signed by &#145;Mary Oxlie of Morpet&#146; but her identity is subsequently confused in the next reprinting of her poem. Edward Phillips, in the section of his <span class="italic">Theatrum poetarum</span> (London, 1675) entitled &#145;Women among the moderns eminent for poetry&#146;, declares her a &#145;Scotch Poetess&#146; but names her &#145;Mary Morpeth&#146;. Oxlie is the only ostensibly Scottish female writer to be named in Phillips's collection. Phillips alludes to &#145;many other things in Poetry&#146; by Oxlie  (Phillips, 259) but nothing else can be securely attributed to her. David Laing in his <span class="italic">Various Pieces of Fugitive Scotish Poetry</span> (1825) attributed to Oxlie two political broadsides but later retracted the ascription, first assumed on the evidence of the initials &#145;M. M.&#146; (the spurious &#145;Mary Morpeth&#146;).<br>
<br>The original 1656 ascription identifies Oxlie as a Northumbrian writer; one inference may be that she either directly moved to Scotland or became indirectly associated with literary circles around Drummond at Hawthornden, south of Edinburgh. David Masson's biography of Drummond (1873) suggests that Phillips obtained this and other dedicatory poems from Drummond's brother-in-law, Sir John Scot of Scotstarvet. Although Oxlie's poem cannot be dated, its presumed existence among Drummond's manuscripts, partly exchanged between Phillips and Scot, implies that it predated the 1656 posthumous edition. The poem contains allusions to Drummond's <span class="italic">Tears on the Death of Moeliades</span> (1613) and the amatory sonnet sequence of <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1616). It may have been presented to Drummond shortly after the 1616 edition, and was possibly not intended for publication. This remains conjectural, but there is evidence to suggest that the literary milieu cultivated by Drummond included women writers such as Anna Hume.<br>
<br>Oxlie's poem opens disingenuously with a plea that her &#145;worke&#146; should not be compared to Drummond's, claiming in her defence, and on behalf of women artists, that creativity is frustrated by social and material concerns and by psychological anxiety:<blockquote>
<div>From an untroubled mind should Verses flow;<br>
</div>
<div>My discontents makes mine too muddy show;<br>
</div>
<div>And hoarse encumbrances of household care<br>
</div>
<div>Where these remaine, the muses ne're repaire.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>This humility is superseded by Oxlie's skilful &#145;recreation&#146; of Drummond's pastoral mode. Ironically, Oxlie's poetic identity has been constituted through imitation. The poem's proposition that &#145;the Tree-turn'd <i>Daphne</i>&#146; will crown the poet with the laurel &#145;garland&#146; is possibly a reply to the commendatory sonnet of William Alexander published in the 1616 edition, as if to consciously &#145;feminize&#146; the original dedication signifying male patronage. Oxlie's extant poem offers an insight into post-1603 Scottish literary culture and the coterie environment which cultivated women writers. Its proto-feminist justification of &#145;limited&#146; female creativity was observed by the American writer and critic Tillie Olsen (<i>b</i>. 1913) in her pioneering work <span class="italic">Silences</span> (1978).<br>
