<span class="headword">Oakeley, Sir  Herbert</span>, third baronet  (1791&#150;1845), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20422/', "Sir Charles Oakeley, first baronet (1751&#150;1826)")</script>, and his wife, Helena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Beatson (<i>d</i>. 1839), was born at Madras, where his father was governor, on 10 February 1791. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20423/', "Frederick Oakeley")</script>, the Tractarian and convert to Rome, was his younger brother. His parents took him to England in 1794, and, after some years at Westminster School, he entered Christ Church, Oxford. In 1810 he took a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>; he graduated BA on 23 February 1811 and obtained a senior studentship. At the installation of Lord Grenville as chancellor on 6 July in the same year he recited, in the Sheldonian Theatre, with excellent effect, a congratulatory ode of his own composition. He proceeded MA on 4 November 1813. Having been ordained, he became in 1814 domestic chaplain to William Howley, then bishop of London, to whom he owed his subsequent preferment, and lived with the bishop for twelve years, until his marriage. He was presented by Bishop Howley to the vicarage of Ealing in 1822, and to the prebendal stall of Wenlock's Barn in St Paul's Cathedral. On 5 June 1826 Oakeley was married at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, to Atholl Keturah Murray (1801&#150;1844), daughter of the Revd Lord Charles Murray Aynsley, and niece of John, fourth duke of Atholl, and then took up his residence at Ealing. By the death without male issue of his elder brother, Charles, who had held the baronetcy only three years, he succeeded in 1830 to the title.<br>
<br>In 1834 Howley, now archbishop of Canterbury, presented Oakeley to the valuable rectory of Bocking in Essex, a living held by Lady Oakeley's father in her childhood. The living then carried with it the right of jurisdiction, under the title of dean and as commissary of the archbishop of Canterbury, over the Essex and Suffolk parishes, which were extra-diocesan and constituted the archbishop's peculiar. This jurisdiction was abolished shortly after Sir Herbert's death. Both at Ealing and at Bocking, Oakeley was one of the first to carry out what became a general system of parochial organization, the innovations including district visitors, weekday services, and Sunday schools. Bocking contained many nonconformists, with whom Oakeley became engaged in lively disputes about church rates; none the less, he was held in general esteem. In 1841 he succeeded Archdeacon Lyall as archdeacon of Colchester, and when the bishopric of Gibraltar was founded in 1842, it was offered to him and declined. Oakeley was unusually reticent in print, for his time, but in 1836 he edited his father's memoirs; he also had privately printed a number of his poems. On 26 January 1844 Oakeley's wife died, and he was so much affected by her loss that he died also in London on 27 March 1845. He left three daughters and four sons, of whom the eldest, Charles William, succeeded to the title and the second, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35273/', "Sir Herbert Stanley Oakeley (1830&#150;1903)")</script>, became professor of music in the University of Edinburgh.<br>
