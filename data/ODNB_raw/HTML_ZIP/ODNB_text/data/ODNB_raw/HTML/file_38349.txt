<span class="headword">Bradley,  Katharine Harris</span>  (1846&#150;1914), <span class="occ">poet</span>, collaborated with her niece <a name="cosubject_38349"></a><span class="headword">Edith Emma Cooper</span>  (1862&#150;1913)<span class="occ"></span> to publish verse under the pseudonym Michael Field. The aunt was born in Birmingham on 27 October 1846, the daughter of Charles Bradley (1810&#150;1848), tobacco manufacturer of a Derbyshire family (who died of cancer when she was only two), and his wife, Emma Harris (1812&#150;1868). Katharine became her own spelling of what at her birth had been Catherine (and on her death certificate was Katherine), although her preference for a series of male nicknames and pseudonyms meant that her own name was rarely used.<br>
<br>Katharine Bradley's much older sister Emma Harris Bradley (1835&#150;1889) had married James Robert Cooper (1818&#150;1897), merchant, about 1860, and in 1861 or 1862 their household was joined by Katharine and her widowed mother (who, like the father, died of cancer). Edith Emma Cooper was born to Emma and James Cooper in High Street, Kenilworth, on 12 January 1862. After the birth of a second daughter, Amy, Emma Cooper became an invalid, and Katharine took over from her sister the upbringing and education of her young niece Edith, tending her as a mother. Katharine had similarly been educated at home, by private tutors, but in 1868 attended the Coll&egrave;ge de France in Paris and later (1874) attended Newnham College, Cambridge, for a vacation course studying the classics. The whole family moved to Stoke Bishop, near Bristol, in 1879, and Katharine and her niece Edith attended courses there at University College. They joined the debating society, arguing eloquently for causes like women's suffrage and anti-vivisection  (Sturgeon, 20). Katharine was briefly a disciple of Ruskin, being swayed in the 1870s by his moral and aesthetic teachings. She joined his Guild of St George in January 1875, but was ejected in 1877 for her confessed atheism  (T. S. Moore and D. C. S. Moore, chapter 7).<br>
<br>In 1875 Katharine had published her first volume of lyrics, <span class="italic">The New Minnesinger</span>, under the name Arran Leigh; in 1881 the collaboration with Edith took shape in their joint publication of <span class="italic">Belleroph&ocirc;n</span> under the names Arran and Isla Leigh. Their aim was to write great verse tragedies based on historical subjects, calling up the male Elizabethan tradition and eschewing modern realism (they admired Rossetti and Pater): they likened themselves to Beaumont and Fletcher. Dorothy Wordsworth was the only other English woman they ranked as a poet at this time.<br>
<br>In 1884, with the publication of the verse dramas <span class="italic">Callirrh&ouml;e</span> and <span class="italic">Fair Rosamund</span>, their joint pseudonym Michael Field was born. &#145;He&#146; was hailed by critics (including Robert Browning) as a major new voice: &#145;a poet of distinguished powers&#146;, &#145;something almost of Shakespearean penetration&#146;, &#145;a fresh gift of song&#146;  (Sturgeon, 27&#150;8). The disguise was not penetrated until after the publication of <span class="italic">Long Ago</span> (1889), based on fragments of Sappho. Just as Katharine had predicted, &#145;the report of lady authorship will dwarf and enfeeble our work at every turn&#146;  (T. S. Moore and D. C. S. Moore, 6). Calling them his &#145;two dear Greek women&#146;, Browning remained an admirer of their work, as did Swinburne, Wilde, Meredith, and Yeats. But after it was known that Michael Field was two spinsters his works were shunned, until at length they resorted to anonymity and found success in 1905 with <span class="italic">Borgia</span>. Lionel Johnson was the only critic ever to praise as they felt they deserved. Nevertheless, they published twenty-seven tragedies, eight volumes of lyrics, and a masque, and had one (prose) play, <span class="italic">A Question of Memory</span>, briefly staged in London; it was produced by J. T. Grein for the Independent Theatre Society in 1893.<br>
<br>Their collaboration was close-knit and closely guarded: &#145;we are closer married [than the Brownings]&#146;, they maintained in <span class="italic">Works and Days</span>  (T. S. Moore and D. C. S. Moore, 16). Katharine (nicknamed Michael) was the short, energetic, vivacious, outgoing partner who loved to study Greek, and who managed their business correspondence; Edith (Henry) was tall, shy, pallid, reflective, of a keener and steadier intellect, more given to Latin than Greek; she kept the accounts. Their economic independence allowed them to remain lifelong worshippers of beauty&#151;&#145;life was one of their arts&#146;, as one contemporary remarked  (Sturgeon, 36). Both women enjoyed continental travel with frequent trips to the art galleries of Europe; <span class="italic">Sight and Song</span> (1892), a series of lyrics centred on various paintings by old masters, was one of the fruits. They issued much of their work through private presses in small, beautifully decorated editions, many designed and published by the artists Charles Shannon and Charles Ricketts, editors of <span class="italic">The Dial</span>, who became their close friends. From about 1885 their partnership had blossomed into a romantic love and they formed a sexual union, at first joyous but later clouded by various guilts. Edith's much-loved father died while walking in the Alps in 1897; his body was not recovered for many months. Edith took the news as a punishment, but he left money that enabled the pair to set up house together for the first time, at Richmond in 1899. Her mother (Katharine's sister) had died in 1889.<br>
<br>In 1907 Edith turned to the Catholic church, remaining a devotee until her death. Katharine at first feared losing her, but then joined her, choosing for her own confessor their friend Father John Gray, poet and probable homosexual. The two women remained devoted companions until their deaths within nine months of each other, both of cancer. Katharine concealed her own illness while nursing Edith, who died on 13 December 1913 at 1 The Paragon, Petersham Road, Richmond. Katharine published <span class="italic">Poems of Adoration</span>, Edith's last work, in 1912, and her own, <span class="italic">Mystic Trees</span>, in 1913. Each was signed Michael Field. After Edith's death, Katharine published early poems by Edith in <span class="italic">Dedicated</span> (1914), also slipping in one of her own, &#145;reverting to the pagan&#146;  (Sturgeon, 57):<blockquote>
<div>In the old accents I will sing, my Glory, my Delight,<br>
</div>
<div>In the old accents, tipped with flame, before we knew the right.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Katharine died at The Cottage, Hawkesyard, Armitage, near Rugeley, Staffordshire, on 26 September 1914; she had been dressing to go to mass. Katharine and Edith were buried together in the St Mary Magdalen cemetery, Mortlake, and a marble tomb was made for them by Charles Ricketts in 1926; it has since disappeared, however, possibly because of deterioration or damage. Twenty-nine volumes of the diaries of Katharine Bradley and Edith Cooper ranging over the period from 1888 to 1914 are housed in the British Library: selected excerpts were published in 1933 as <span class="italic">Works and Days</span>. Their verse writing is uneven, their plays are marred by an indulgence in archaisms, but many of their lyrics are fine, especially the more passionate love poems.<br>
