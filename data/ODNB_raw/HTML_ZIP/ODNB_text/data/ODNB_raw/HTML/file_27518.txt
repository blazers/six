<span class="headword">Tomkinson,  Thomas</span>  (1631&#150;<em>c.</em>1710), <span class="occ">Muggletonian</span>, was the son of Richard Tomkinson and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1661/2), of Sladehouse in the parish of Ilam, Staffordshire. He came from a family of substantial tenant farmers long settled in the parishes of Ilam and Blore Ray. Tomkinson may have acquired his considerable learning from the library belonging to the estate of his namesake Thomas Tomkinson, who was buried at Blore Ray on 25 December 1640. The future Muggletonian &#145;procured a library of presbyterian books&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and he also borrowed books (including St Augustine's <span class="italic">City of God</span> and the works of the Anglican apologist Henry Hammond) from his landlord, Thomas Cromwell, fourth Baron Cromwell and first earl of Ardglass, at Throwley Hall. On his mother's death in late 1661 or early 1662, Tomkinson's father made over his affairs to him, and boarded with his son as a lodger. Shortly after Tomkinson married &#145;a good virtuous maid&#146; (whose name he does not record), who brought with her a marriage portion of &pound;120 so that Tomkinson was able to pay his father for his cattle  (BL, Add. MS 42505, fol. 2<i>v</i>). Tomkinson established himself as a factor and remained in Staffordshire until at least 1681. That year proved expensive for him when he lost &pound;140, partly through damages awarded against him for a squib against his local minister whom he accused of popery, partly through the failure of a chapman in London with whom he traded.<br>
<br>In February 1652 God spoke to John Reeve, co-founder of Muggletonianism, and told him (on three successive mornings) that he and his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton, were the &#145;Two Last Witnesses&#146; revealed in chapter 11 of the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span>. Ten days afterwards Tomkinson had a visionary experience, suffering wonderful things in his sleep, when &#145;things were made plain to me and I beheld wonders inexpressible&#146;  (Tomkinson, &#145;Christian converte&#146;). Yet Tomkinson did not hear about God's commission until nearly a decade later, remaining until then &#145;a most zealeous prespeterian&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 42505, fol. 4<i>v</i>). It was through reading the writings of Lawrence Clarkson that Tomkinson was able to tie up his own previous revelation with the principles of the new Muggletonian religion. His mother, who had shared her son's presbyterian commitment, followed her son into the new faith. She found hardest to give up her old presbyterian practice of praying to God, an issue over which Muggleton had broken with Reeve: Muggleton (and Tomkinson enthusiastically endorsed his position) denied that God took &#145;immediate notice&#146; of his creatures.<br>
<br>Tomkinson's conversion was in 1661 but it would be another three years before he was fully committed to Muggletonianism, and blessed by Muggleton. During these three years Tomkinson pursued the prophet with detailed questions&#151;he later praised Muggleton's patience in answering these doubts. He might not have been too pleased to know of Muggleton's comment to a third party: &#145;what a great deale of paine to please the unsatisfied fancye of one particular man&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 60171, fol. 373). To some exquisite rhapsody of doubts from Tomkinson in 1664 comes the prophet's revealingly brusque reply: &#145;Nothing venture, nothing have&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 60171, fol. 406). But by August of that year a believer, Ellen Sudbury, is welcoming him to the fold, and is also excited by news of his wife's growing interest. Just before his marriage Tomkinson had gone up to London to see Muggleton, leaving Staffordshire on May day 1662. He later acknowledged that he had occasionally attended church &#145;to please an old father and a young wife&#146;, until 1674  (BL, Add. MS 42505, fol. 2<i>v</i>). His father remained hostile to his son's new belief. Muggleton in 1666 wrote to Tomkinson that his wife would lose nothing by committing herself to the faith &#145;if she hold out to the End&#146;  (Delamaine, 180). Tomkinson's daughter, Anne (there was also a son, Thomas), was blessed by Muggleton on 10 July 1684.<br>
<br>The Tomkinson conversion was thus not straightforward: his enlightenment had preceded his discovery of his new religion; the occasional conformity he himself had practised (although he claimed, on the other side, to have made over twenty converts) would find dubious echoes in the behaviour of his brother-in-law and sister, who avoided persecution in 1682 by pretending to be papists. But it was, in the end, a prize worth having. Muggleton recognized this, however belatedly, when he used his authority (rarely exercised in this manner) to prevent Tomkinson from emigrating in 1674 to avoid persecution. When Tomkinson did turn up in court to pay a fine, Archdeacon Cook overheard him explaining to a Quaker where his doctrines were wrong. The sequel was a happy one. Cook was reported to have said &#145;if hee have no worse principles than this hee is not to be blamed&#146;. So Tomkinson and a friend paid a 20<i>s</i>. fine each, while two Baptists were fined &pound;16. Tomkinson said &#145;they never knew how I came off for our business was private&#146;  (Tomkinson, &#145;Christian converte&#146;).<br>
<br>Clarkson had been Tomkinson's introduction to Muggletonianism. Although personally disgraced in 1661 for challenging Muggleton's leadership, Clarkson was not ideologically disgraced. When one of Tomkinson's cavils prior to conversion had been whether the man Jesus knew he was God while on earth, Muggleton referred (this was in 1664) to the authority of Clarkson for support  (BL, Add. MS 60171, fol. 404). Clarkson had been emphatic that God did not take &#145;immediate notice&#146; of men and women, and Tomkinson followed Clarkson and Muggleton on this. In 1664 he wrote a concordance of Reeve's and Muggleton's writings, and scriptural references in support of the Muggleton/Clarkson doctrine were inserted  (BL, Add. MS 60189, fol. 1<i>v</i>). The debate acquired new urgency in 1671 when Muggleton's denial of &#145;immediate notice&#146; became the basis of a rebellion against his leadership, led principally by William Medgate and Walter Buchanan. Tomkinson was present at the debate between Muggleton and Buchanan and believed that Muggleton won it hands down: &#145;I was wonderfully satisfied at the prophets doctrine concerning God not taking notice of every particular Action that is done&#146;  (Tomkinson, &#145;Christian converte&#146;). But he acknowledged in his <span class="italic">&#145;Zions Sonnes&#146;</span> of 1679 that he himself had initially been tempted by the rebels' principles. The temptation had not lasted; he was boasting indeed in a letter to believers in Ireland in 1674 that he had enjoyed ten years &#145;without the least Doubt&#146; in the faith  (BL, Add. MS 60180, fol. 12).<br>
<br>Nobody would prove better in communicating such certainties than Tomkinson. He was the ablest of all Muggletonian writers in his age&#151;perhaps in the religion's history. His greatest work was <span class="italic">Truth's Triumph</span> (published 1823). He wrote it in 1676; in April 1679 his fellow believer Alexander Delamaine wrote to him to say how much Muggleton had approved of it; in 1690 Tomkinson made additions to the manuscript; and he dedicated it to Muggleton on 9 August 1691. He does not add to the doctrines of Reeve and Muggleton, but they are presented in a sophisticated manner and backed by references to scholarly sources. What is clear in this work, and in others, is his explicit admiration for Thomas Hobbes. They shared reverence for magistracy, belief in mortalism and materialism, respect for Job, and contempt for free will and the Trinity.<br>
<br>Tomkinson was to have a pivotal role in the publication of Muggleton's autobiography in 1699, <span class="italic">The Acts of the Witnesses</span>. Muggleton had been known to be working upon the manuscript for some time but would not let anybody see it. But two weeks before his death (in 1698), he put it into the hands of Tomkinson. Tomkinson had ended his own 1692 work, <span class="italic">The Harmony of the Three Commissions, or, None but Christ</span> (published 1757), with a desperate postscript, lamenting internal strife within the movement. In the dedicatory epistle with which Tomkinson now prefaced the publication of Muggleton's posthumous memoirs the same sombre note was struck: there was no salvation for the believers who professed to own Reeve, and yet who would not acknowledge Muggleton. The 1671 scars had therefore not healed: they would even persist into Victorian Muggletonianism. But no man had done more to prevent this happening than Tomkinson. He died about 1710 in London, where he had settled some time after 1681.<br>
