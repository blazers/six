<span class="headword">Wallis,  Samuel</span>  (1728&#150;1795), <span class="occ">naval officer and Pacific explorer</span>, the son of John Wallis (1680&#150;1768) and Sarah Barrett (<i>d</i>. 1731), was born in April 1728 at Fentonwoon, Cornwall, and baptized on 23 April 1728 at Lanteglos. He served in the navy as midshipman and master's mate before receiving his lieutenant's commission in October 1748. After serving as lieutenant on several ships from 1753 onwards, he received his first command, the sloop <i>Swan</i>, in June 1756. In April 1757 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Port Mahon</i>, and in September 1758 to the <i>Prince of Orange</i> (60 guns). In 1759 he took part in the Quebec campaign under Vice-Admiral Charles Saunders before returning with his ship to home waters for the rest of the Seven Years' War.<br>
<br>In June 1766 Wallis took command of the frigate <i>Dolphin</i> (24 guns) just back from Commodore John Byron's circumnavigation. The choice of Wallis for the second voyage of Pacific exploration in the reign of George III was perhaps a sign of his meritorious service during the war, which would have been observed at first hand by Saunders, now second lord of the Admiralty. In a long naval career the voyage of 1766 to 1768 represents Wallis's claim to fame. It had different objectives from Byron's voyage, for his instructions from the Admiralty, headed by the earl of Egmont, ordered Wallis to search for the great continent &#145;Terra Australis Incognita&#146; in the south Pacific. Byron seems to have played an important role in framing this new directive. When sailing through the Tuamotus in June 1765 he had become convinced that there was a land mass to the south; and it appears to have been his belief in the existence of this southern continent that persuaded Egmont to point Wallis towards its discovery.<br>
<br>Wallis sailed on 21 August 1766, accompanied by Philip Carteret in the old and decrepit sloop <i>Swallow</i>. There were few problems with the well-provisioned <i>Dolphin</i>, only the third naval vessel to be copper-sheathed. After a gruelling passage through the Strait of Magellan of record-breaking length (the <i>Dolphin</i> took 115 days, the <i>Swallow</i> 119), the two vessels became separated on 11 April 1767 as they struggled out of the strait and into the Pacific. Carteret suspected that Wallis had deliberately abandoned the slow-sailing <i>Swallow</i>; but it is more likely that the explanation lies in a combination of the hazardous sailing conditions off Cape Pillar at the western exit of the strait and the different sailing qualities of the two ships. While in the strait Wallis had taken the opportunity to measure the height of a group of Patagonians, and his findings&#151;the tallest person was 6 feet 7 inches, and most were under 6 feet&#151;did something to dispel the notion of &#145;Patagonian giants&#146; brought back by Byron.<br>
<br>Once clear of the Strait of Magellan Wallis followed his instructions to &#145;Stretch to the Westward &hellip; from Cape Horn, loosing as little Southing as possible&#146;  (Wallis, 2.303); but by the end of April contrary winds and scurvy among the crew forced him northwards into warmer waters. On 6 June he reached the Tuamotus, where he sighted five islands unknown to Europeans, and on 17 June the first of the Society Islands at Mehetia. The next day Tahiti was sighted, and there the <i>Dolphin</i> stayed for five weeks. During this time the sick among the crew recovered, but Wallis (and his first lieutenant) were struck down with with &#145;a Bilious Disorder&#146;  (Carrington, 116). For most of the stay Wallis was too weak to keep the deck, and much depended on George Robertson, the <i>Dolphin</i>'s experienced master, and Tobias Furneaux, second lieutenant. The captain's incapacity was the more worrying, given the outbreaks of violence that marked the first days after the <i>Dolphin</i>'s arrival and thwarted Wallis's hopes of avoiding the use of force. It took blasts of grape and ball from the ship's cannon, and many dead and wounded among the Tahitians, to quell the disturbances. Wallis's description of Tahiti (as printed in Hawkesworth's <span class="italic">Voyages</span> of 1773) as a lush and fertile land with garlanded women eager to trade sexual favours helped, along with the accounts of James Cook and Joseph Banks, to stamp an erotic imprint on Europe's image of the south seas. In practical ways, too, Tahiti was important, for it provided an ideal base for Cook and his successors. For Robertson, the island also seemed to be an outlier of the great southern continent, whose mountain-tops the master thought he had glimpsed only 60 miles to the south. Wallis's views on this are not known, but on 27 July 1767 he left Tahiti on a westerly course and made no attempt to explore to the south. Further uncharted islands were sighted as the <i>Dolphin</i> continued west and then northwest before heading into the north Pacific. The last part of the voyage brought Wallis home by way of Tinian, Batavia, and the Cape. The <i>Dolphin</i> reached the Downs on 28 May 1768, with Wallis still seriously ill.<br>
<br>Wallis's voyage is now seen as a more creditable undertaking than was once thought. On his own count, he had discovered and charted fifteen islands, some of them admittedly tiny atolls. Although in wretched health for months on end, he had achieved much that was to help shape Cook's <i>Endeavour</i> voyage. Tahiti provided the essential base for the astronomical observations of the transit of Venus in 1769, and rumours brought back by the <i>Dolphin</i> of mountain-tops sighted south of the island led to Cook's instructions to sail directly south from Tahiti in search of a continent. Whether there was direct contact between Wallis and Cook in the summer of 1768 is not known, but many of Cook's measures to keep his crews healthy had already been put into practice by Wallis. He made every effort to obtain greens and citrus fruits, he kept the crew's clothes and bedding dry and clean, and he introduced a three-watch system to give the men more rest. They in turn seem to have respected and liked their captain; in a petition at the end of the voyage they applauded his &#145;Humane and generous treatment&#146;, and signed themselves &#145;the Dolphins&#146;  (Wallis, 1.47). There were serious and debilitating outbreaks of scurvy on the <i>Dolphin</i>, but not a single man died from this disease, and the mortality rate on the voyage was remarkably low: two dead from accidents, and three from malaria and dysentery.<br>
<br>Wallis took a long time to recover from &#145;the uncommon fatigue and anxiety&#146; of the voyage. During it he had been &#145;quite worn down&#146;, he told the Admiralty in February 1770, when he still suffered from bouts of ill health. He was awarded a gratuity of &pound;525 before, in November 1770, he was given command of the <i>Torbay</i>, and later of the <i>Queen</i>. From 1782 to 1783, and from 1787 until his death, Wallis held the responsible position of extra commissioner of the navy. He died on 21 January 1795 in Devonshire Street, Portland Place, London, and was survived by his wife, Betty Hearle, who died on 13 November 1804.<br>
