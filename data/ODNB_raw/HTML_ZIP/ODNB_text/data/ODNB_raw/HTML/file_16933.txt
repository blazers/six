<span class="headword">Lofting,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1659&#150;1742), <span class="occ">merchant and manufacturer of engines</span>, was a native of the Netherlands, one of at least two brothers. He later recorded that he &#145;lived seven years at Amsterdam with one of the masters of the fire engines there, and is thoroughly acquainted with the methods practised in those parts in quenching of fires&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He came to England, obtaining grants of free denization in July 1686 and August 1688. At the time of his marriage, at St Nicholas Cole Abbey, London, on 3 May 1689, Lofting was described as a merchant, aged about thirty, and resident in the parish of St Thomas Apostle, London. His wife was Hester Bass of St Michael Queenhithe, London, aged nineteen, sister of Jeremiah Basse, future governor of New Jersey. In June 1689 Lofting enrolled in the Company of Free Shipwrights, paying quarterage until January 1699, thereby becoming a citizen of London.<br>
<br>In October 1689 Lofting and Nicholas de Wael petitioned for a patent for the sole making and selling of &#145;an engine for quenching fire, the like never seen before in this kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1689&#150;90</i>, 283). A patent was granted to Lofting (no. 263) and a joint-stock company set up to exploit it. Lofting's fire engine was probably the first in England to use a wired suction hose to throw water as high as 400 feet, and could &#145;force the Water in a continued Stream into Alleys, Yards, Back houses, Stair-Cases; and other obscure places, where other Engines are useless&#146;  (Houghton, letter of 5 Jan 1694). The engines were employed at several royal palaces, and their use at a number of London fires was praised by Christopher Wren. In 1694 Lofting was involved in disputes with a rival, George Oldner, over advice to London aldermen on fire precautions. John Houghton advocated using Lofting's fire engines for drainage or the watering of agricultural land, and Lofting also marketed an engine for &#145;Starting of Beer and other Liquors&#146;  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 14&#150;17 March 1691). After 1696 nothing is known of Lofting's engines, production may have ceased, but his advice on fire engines was sought at Marlow in 1730.<br>
<br>In April 1693 Lofting was granted a patent (no. 319) for making and selling an engine to replace hand punching in the manufacture of brass thimbles. He began producing thimbles and sewing rings shortly afterwards, the first important manufacturer in England. John Houghton's detailed description of the horse-powered thimble works at Islington shows that Lofting had imported skilled workmen from the continent as well as the technology. Shortly before July 1697, Lofting moved from Islington to a water mill at Marlow in Buckinghamshire in order to double production to over 2 million thimbles a year.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1690s Lofting continued as a merchant. He imported iron wire for his engines, dealt in wheat, exported upholstery ware and pewter to the Baltic and America, petitioned parliament about the import of French goods, traded with his brother in Amsterdam, and in 1696 was accused of setting up a lottery for illegal currency speculation. In 1698 Lofting and Jeremiah Basse shipped goods to Perth Amboy, East New Jersey, in the <i>Hester</i>, a sloop owned by Basse. It discharged without calling at or paying New York customs dues, and the governor of New York seized the ship and sold it. Lofting and Basse appealed to parliament and took legal action, eventually receiving damages and costs of &pound;1890, but not before Lofting was declared bankrupt in March 1700.<br>
<br>About 1696 Lofting, in partnership with Gaspar Frederick Henning, a German immigrant, obtained a 31-year lease to Marlow corn mills. They continued grinding corn, but set up an oil mill and a thimble manufactory as well. Lofting took up residence at Marlow soon afterwards, and this business became the basis of his revived fortunes after the bankruptcy, receiving praise from Daniel Defoe in 1721. From 1714 Lofting had a new partner, a corn factor called Merrett, but from 1724 he operated alone. A London business address was maintained, at Broken Wharf in Thames Street. Making his will in 1733 Lofting described himself as a gentleman whose living now mainly arose from the good management of his mills, but a codicil in 1737 noted that &#145;my estate has been lessened by losses of Rent and other accidents&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/719 sig. 193).<br>
<br>On 23 July 1709 Hester was buried at Marlow. On 16 December 1710 Lofting married Mary Carter of Eton at St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London. Mary died in October 1721 and Lofting never remarried. The first marriage produced at least one daughter and six sons, the second one daughter and two sons; but when Lofting died on 15 June 1742 only the six sons from the first marriage survived. The mills, the house he lived in, and the Three Tuns New inn in Marlow were left to his son Benjamin, who was to make payments to his brothers. Benjamin and his brother John continued the business, but do not seem to have renewed the lease to the mills in 1753. Samuel pursued a naval career until 1745, when he was dismissed, perhaps for suffering himself to be beaten by a marine, and William acquired wealth through a legal career and established a trust, Lofting's Charity, for the benefit of the poor of Marlow.<br>
