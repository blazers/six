<span class="headword">Holmes,  George</span>  (1661/2&#150;1749), <span class="occ">archivist</span>, was born at Skipton in Craven, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to unknown parents. He was for many years a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of William Petyt (1641?&#150;1707), keeper of the records in the Tower of London from 1689 to 1706. Both were educated at Skipton grammar school, and about 1691 Holmes was appointed one of Petyt's clerks at the Tower; until about 1705 he lodged in his house. Petyt bequeathed him &pound;200 in 1707. In 1699 Holmes married Elizabeth Marshall (<i>d</i>. in or after 1749), the daughter of a Fleet Street sword-cutter; they had one son, George.<br>
<br>Petyt's successor as keeper, Richard Topham, made Holmes his chief clerk in September 1706, and six months later appointed him his deputy. Holmes was reappointed by Topham's successor, Polhill. As deputy keeper, Holmes effectively was head of the office, and thus was in charge of most of the older records of the chancery and parliament; in 1731 he was formally appointed keeper, and he retained this office until his death. For a time his son was clerk under him, but he predeceased his father.<br>
<br>In 1704 Holmes acted as secretary of a House of Lords subcommittee that prepared a scheme for housing, sorting, and calendaring certain of the records in the Tower; the final report of this committee (1707) was followed a few months later by Holmes's permanent appointment to methodize and digest&#151;in other words, to calendar&#151;the Tower records, at a yearly salary of &pound;200.<br>
<br>Holmes's professional competence was displayed in the compilation of a general calendar of the Tower records (of which a copy is perhaps identifiable as BL, Stowe MS 543, fols. 1&#150;38), and in his revision of the first seventeen volumes of Thomas Rymer's <span class="italic">Foedera</span>. For the second edition of this enormous collection of historical texts he collated the printed versions with the originals in the Tower and made many hundreds of corrections. The revised volumes were published between 1727 and 1729; in addition he issued a separate listing of his corrections as <span class="italic">The Emendations in the New Edition of Mr Rymer's Foedera</span> (1730). He also made some of the transcripts, and certified others, for an intended edition of the rolls of parliament, which was finally published in six volumes as <span class="italic">Rotuli parliamentorum</span> (1767&#150;83). He was always highly regarded for his helpfulness to historical researchers.<br>
<br>Holmes was a sociable man, with a wide circle of friends in the antiquarian world. In 1698 the palaeographer Humfrey Wanley encountered him at the Cotton Library:<blockquote>we never saw one another before, and yet he was pleas'd to entertain so good an opinion of me at first sight, that he would needs have me dine with him, which I did: his lodgings being not 200 yards from mine: there he entertain'd me very kindly, &amp;c. (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 90)</blockquote>He was a member of the Society of Antiquaries from almost its beginning, being brought to its third meeting, in January 1708, by Peter Le Neve, and he was a founder member when it was revived in 1717. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society (1741).<br>
<br>Holmes was a keen numismatist, and in 1722 undertook to catalogue the Saxon coins of John Hill, as part of a project planned by Le Neve for catalogues of all the ancient coins relative to Great Britain; the project never came to fruition, however. Holmes himself in 1692 had shown some Dutch medals of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to a group of friends at the Mitre tavern.<br>
<br>Holmes died, aged eighty-seven, on 16 February 1749, and was survived by his wife. He was buried in the chapel of the Tower of London. His library, consisting of books and some manuscripts and books of prints, and his collection of coins and medals were both sold by auction in December 1749. In tribute to his memory a portrait of him was engraved by George Vertue in the same year, at the charge of the Society of Antiquaries; the painting on which this was based, by R. van Bleeck, was itself presented to the society in 1766 by his friend James West.<br>
