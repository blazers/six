<span class="headword">Stewart,  Walter</span>, earl of Atholl, first earl of Caithness, and earl of Strathearn  (early 1360s&#150;1437), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the youngest legitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23713/', "Robert II (1316&#150;1390), king of Scots")</script>, and second son of his second marriage, to Euphemia Ross [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54314/', "Euphemia (b. in or before 1329?, d. 1388/)")</script>]. He was born in the early 1360s, but first appears at his marriage in 1378 to Margaret, daughter and heir of David Barclay of Brechin. By comparison with the lands and titles given to his elder brothers, Walter received only limited grants from his father, and did not become an earl until in his forties. His slow rise to importance was undertaken in alliance with his half-brother Robert Stewart, earl of Fife and duke of Albany, and grants of customs revenue and landed significance coincided with the latter's periods of authority after 1388. Walter also benefited from the death of his only full brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54325/', "David Stewart, earl of Strathearn and Caithness")</script>, before March 1389. Acting as tutor, or guardian, for David's daughter, Euphemia, Walter ran Strathearn for the next fifteen years. In this role he supported the interests of Robert, earl of Fife, in the region, leading military expeditions into the highlands against another brother, Alexander Stewart of Badenoch, in the 1390s. Walter also backed Robert (now duke of Albany) in his coup of 1402 against David, duke of Rothesay; Walter Bower, writing in the 1440s, even accused Walter Stewart of being the instigator of Rothesay's death. Albany certainly diverted patronage to his brother from 1402. Rothesay's earldom of Atholl and lordship of Methven were with dubious legality granted to Walter by Albany in 1404, following an earlier resignation to him of the earldom of Caithness by his niece Euphemia (<i>c</i>.1400).<br>
<br>These rewards may have been intended to compensate Atholl for the loss of Strathearn on Euphemia's marriage to Patrick Graham, an adherent of Albany. However, Atholl may have continued to interfere in Strathearn and seems to have exploited, possibly even arranged, Graham's murder in 1413 to renew his hold on the earldom as tutor for Patrick's son, Malise Graham. His recovery of Strathearn was probably achieved against the wishes of Albany, perhaps indicating a rivalry for influence in Perthshire between the two. That may in turn have determined Atholl's stance in 1424 on the return of James I. His support of the king's execution of Murdoch, duke of Albany, and his sons in 1425 removed his powerful neighbour, and from that year Atholl was administering the former Albany lordships in Perthshire as both sheriff and justiciar. The king also secured Atholl's hold on Strathearn by forcing Earl Malise to resign his lands to his tutor before departing to England as a hostage for the king in 1427. Such rewards emphasize the good relations between James I and his half-uncle and although Atholl's elder son, David, was also sent as a hostage, he and his other kin received frequent signs of royal favour. His second son, Alan, received his father's earldom of Caithness in 1430 and was given a major role in the king's war against the lordship of the Isles, in which he was killed at the battle of Inverlochy in 1431. His place was filled by Atholl's grandson, Robert, the son of David. As he reached adulthood Robert was made the king's personal chamberlain and both grandson and grandfather retained a special place as James's closest kinsmen and, after his young son, heirs to the throne.<br>
<br>While Atholl and Robert enjoyed the king's full trust, by early 1437 their attitude to him had altered. The root of this was insecurity about the long-term prospects of their family&#151;an insecurity which the death of Atholl's elder son, David, who had never been redeemed from his captivity in England, can only have increased, just as it must also have engendered hostility towards the king on the part of Atholl and his kin. Atholl's successful management of crown lands in Perthshire had seen them removed from his custody as they came to profit and, since Strathearn was held by Walter in liferent, he feared that it too would be annexed by a king who was increasingly desperate for funds. These losses would reverse Atholl's efforts since 1389 and were encouraged by evidence of royal favour going elsewhere. Queen Joan, William, earl of Angus, and Archibald, earl of Douglas, all now rivalled Atholl's influence with James. Royal interference in Atholl's power base was the last straw. In January 1437 the king overrode local wishes to appoint his nephew James Kennedy as bishop of Dunkeld. Fears of a rival in the region and loss of face with the community combined with wider concerns to prompt Atholl, who was perhaps also encouraged by the ambitions of his grandson, Robert, to launch a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>.<br>
<br>Early 1437 was the ideal time for such an attack. The king had suffered a series of setbacks, stemming from his failed campaign on the borders the previous year, and appeared vulnerable. Atholl's connections put him in a position to take advantage of this. Links with servants of the dukes of Albany such as Sir Robert Graham (even though Graham could plausibly have resented Atholl's activities in 1413, anent the death of Sir Robert's brother Patrick) provided him with a group of irreconcilable opponents of the king, while his own adherents, his grandson, Robert Stewart, as an important figure at court, and John Spens, steward of the heir to the throne, the future James II, were well placed to assist the killing of the king and seizure of the young James. The assassination of James I at Perth on 21 February 1437 showed the value of these connections. Atholl sought to distance himself from events by withdrawing to his principal residence at Methven Castle, 4 miles from Perth. But the failure of his agents to kill the queen and to secure the new king in Edinburgh proved fatal. Although he maintained resistance for perhaps three weeks after the murder, Atholl was eventually captured by the earl of Angus at the head of the queen's forces. He was taken to Edinburgh and tried before a parliament dominated by the queen's partisans. Despite protestations of innocence he was found guilty and on the afternoon of 26 March 1437 was beheaded.<br>
<br>As the instigator of a failed coup, Atholl received universal vilification from Scottish writers. He was &#145;that old serpent&#146;  (Skene, 2.289) and &#145;a man grown old in a life of evil-doing&#146;  (Bower, 8.301) who clawed his way towards the throne in fulfilment of a Gypsy's prophecy. Atholl's career displayed ambition and a readiness to use force to achieve his ends, yet his methods were not exceptional. Other magnates, most notably his brother Albany, could show a similar approach to the maintenance of magnate power.<br>
