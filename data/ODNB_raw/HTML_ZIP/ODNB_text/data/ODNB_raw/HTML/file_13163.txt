<span class="headword">Hey,  William</span>  (1736&#150;1819), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 23 August 1736, in the village of Pudsey, near Leeds, Yorkshire, the fourth of the eight children of Richard Hey, drysalter (<i>d</i>. 1766), and his wife, Mary (1702&#150;1768), daughter of Jacob Simpson, a surgeon apothecary. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13162/', "Richard Hey (1745&#150;1835)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13161/', "John Hey (1734&#150;1815)")</script> were his brothers. His father's family had been prosperous drysalters (suppliers of oils and chemicals to clothiers) in Pudsey for several generations. His father, known as &#145;honest Mr Hey&#146;, was a man of unbending probity and great piety. At every important point in his early career William followed his father's advice and benefited from his financial help. When Hey was three years old his clothing caught fire and he nearly burnt to death; the next year he wounded his eye with a penknife and lost his sight in that eye. In 1743 Hey and his brother John were sent to the short-lived Heath Academy near Wakefield, where he received an excellent education in natural philosophy, mathematics, French, and music. Hey had a lifelong love of music. In 1750 he was apprenticed to William Dawson, a surgeon apothecary in Leeds, and joined the Methodists about 1754. At this time Methodists considered themselves to be members of the Church of England and Hey was always an Anglican; he parted from the Methodists in 1781. In 1757 Hey went to London, where he became a student of William Bromfield at St George's Hospital. He was an unusually determined and able student who devoted many hours to dissection. He returned to Leeds in 1759, declined an offer of partnership from Dawson, and set up his own practice. After one year as apothecary to the Leeds workhouse Hey began to campaign for an infirmary at Leeds, serving as a surgeon in a temporary building that opened on Michaelmas day 1767 and becoming a staff surgeon when the infirmary building opened in 1771. In 1773 he became the senior surgeon, serving until his retirement in 1812.<br>
<br>Hey's London training made him far better qualified than locally trained surgeons to undertake difficult operations. However, the demand for such surgery was limited, and his career was also impeded by his devout Methodism and the competition of rivals. It was ten years before he earned enough to support his growing family. Hey's marriage on 30 July 1761 to Alice (<i>c</i>.1737&#150;1820), daughter of Margaret and Robert Banks of Giggleswick, had brought him a modest fortune and was a lifelong comfort; they had thirteen children, of whom eleven died either in infancy or early adulthood. Their daughter Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1816) married Robert Jarratt, vicar of Wellington, Somerset, in 1797; John (<i>d</i>. 1801) became a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge; Robert died in 1802; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13164/', "William Hey (1772&#150;1844)")</script> became a surgeon and succeeded his father in his medical practice. About 1769 Hey formed a close friendship with the natural philosopher Joseph Priestley, who described Hey as &#145;the only person in Leeds who gave any attention to my experiments&#146;  (Bell, 1066). Hey published two criticisms of Priestley's theological tracts; however, this did not impair their friendship, and it was Priestley who successfully proposed Hey for a fellowship of the Royal Society in 1775. Hey injured his knee in 1773 and an injury to the same leg in 1778 left him permanently lame, forcing him to make all his professional visits in a carriage. He was never again able to stand for more than a few minutes or to walk any further than the length of a room without a crutch.<br>
<br>Hey became a councilman in Leeds in 1781 and an alderman in 1786. He twice served as mayor, in 1787&#150;8 and in 1802&#150;3. His vigorous efforts to enforce the proclamation against vice, profaneness, and immorality (1787) created resentment in the town. Not only was Hey burnt in effigy, but a mob stopped his carriage while his wife was inside, cut the traces, and stabbed one of his horses. The episode &#145;much disordered&#146; his wife's health  (Pearson, 2.31), but did not deter his activities. Hey was also forced to defend the actions of his constables at the York assizes, but his legal expenses were defrayed by his friend William Wilberforce, who supported his efforts. Hey founded the Leeds Medical Society in 1768 and in the same year he became a member of the London Medical Society. He also served as president of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society in 1783, and was a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. He supported the abolition of slavery, criminal law reform, the Lancastrian school movement, and various missionary activities, but deprecated some of the views expressed by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. Unlike Wilberforce, he opposed Catholic emancipation. He founded the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span> as a response to the dissenters' <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span>. After his death, a volume entitled <span class="italic">Tracts and essays, moral and theological, including a defence of the divinity of Christ, and of the atonement</span> (1822) collected several religious tracts that he had published during his life.<br>
<br>Hey was a skilled, observant, and innovative surgeon. His published papers in <span class="italic">Medical Observations and Inquiries</span> included accounts of extra-uterine pregnancy (1766), rupture of the bladder (1768), and the use of electricity to treat blindness. His electrical experiments, which took place between 1766 and 1771, may have been inspired by John Wesley's advocacy of electrotherapy as well as by his friendship with Priestley. Hey's book <span class="italic">Observations on the Blood</span> (1779) disputed the views of William Hewson concerning the effect of inflammation on the coagulation of blood. His most important book was <span class="italic">Practical Observations in Surgery</span> (1803). He developed small saws for trephination instead of drills; these were later named after him, as were Hey's operation, a partial amputation of the foot in front of the tarso-metatarsal joint; Hey's hernia, encysted hernia; Hey's internal derangement of the knee, a partial dislocation of the knee; and Hey's ligament, a band of fibrous tissue which forms the edge of a hole in the covering of the muscle just below the groin, through which the saphenous vein passes to join the femoral vein. He was the first fully to describe and name the soft malignant bleeding tumour known as fungus haematodes. In his last publication (1816) he argued that syphilis could be transmitted from a mother to her unborn children.<br>
<br>In amputations Hey followed the work of Edward Alanson and Benjamin Bell, and strongly emphasized the importance of healing the wound by first intention (without suppuration). He also valued conservative surgery. In one dramatic case, a nine-year-old boy broke his elbow joint and humerus. Hey dissected out the broken part of the humerus and placed the arm on a pillow, bent at the elbow. The child recovered well, and could use the injured arm. Hey was an extremely gifted anatomist who gave well attended public lectures using the bodies of executed criminals. These lectures took place at the Leeds Infirmary, to which he donated the profits. Even very late in life he was so dedicated to anatomical research that he twice travelled to London to consult with Astley Cooper on the anatomy of hernias. Hey's achievement is remarkable in light of the fact that he could see with only one eye, and was barely able to stand erect for the final forty years of his life. In his prime he was reserved, inattentive, and forbidding, but as he grew older and more comfortable with his success, he became friendly, open, and cheerful. He remained alert and active until shortly before his death in Leeds on 23 March 1819. His body was placed in the crypt of St Paul's Church, Park Square, Leeds. His devoted student Richard Pearson attributed his longevity to his temperate life, even temper, and deep religious convictions.<br>
