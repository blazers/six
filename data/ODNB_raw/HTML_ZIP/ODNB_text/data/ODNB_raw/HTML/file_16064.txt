<span class="headword">Laporte,  John Peter</span>  (1761&#150;1839), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, may have been born in Dublin. He may be identified with the John Peter, son of Gabriel and Anne Laporte, who was baptized at St Anne's, Soho, on 29 March 1761. When first definitely heard of in London he was a pupil of the Dublin-born Huguenot landscape painter John Melchior Barralet, in whose house, 3 Orange Street, he was living in 1779. A fellow pupil of one of the Barralet brothers, perhaps John James, was William Frederick Wells, later the moving spirit behind the foundation of the Society of Painters in Water Colours; another lifelong friend of Laporte was the sporting painter H. B. Chalon.<br>
<br>Laporte first exhibited at both the Royal Academy and the British Institution in 1785, habitually showing landscapes. During the 1780s he changed address frequently, living for the most part in the artists' quarter around Tottenham Court Road and Soho. For some years from about 1789 he lodged at 4 Gresse Street, sharing with the topographical artist John Hassell in 1792&#150;3. By 1802 he had moved to 21 Winchester Street, Edgware Road, which remained his home until about 1830. In his <span class="italic">Tour of the Isle of Wight</span> (1790), Hassell records meeting him at Alum Bay in 1789, and they probably visited Wales together in 1792. Laporte was a regular visitor to the Lake District from 1790 and to Ireland from 1795. It is possible that he travelled to Madeira in 1807 or 1808, and later to Italy and Switzerland, but equally his exhibited views may have been worked up from other travellers' drawings.<br>
<br>Laporte built up a considerable practice as a drawing master, but the repeated claim that he was professor of drawing at the Addiscombe military academy is a confusion with Wells. Probably his most distinguished pupil was Dr Thomas Monro, the patron of Girtin and Turner, to whom he sold drawings to the value of &pound;500 or &pound;600, according to Joseph Farington. He may well have met Turner, either at Monro's house in the Adelphi, where he dined frequently, or through their mutual friend Wells. In any event, Laporte's work does occasionally show hints of Turner's early style, although for the most part it remains true to the Sandby tradition. His favourite compositional form leads the eye &#145;along the line of some high object (in one case the side of a wood, in the other an almost precipitous hill) diagonally across the picture to the skyline&#146;  (Williams, 62).<br>
<br>Occasionally Laporte produced oil paintings, one of which is in the Derby Art Gallery. However, his best-known works are in gouache, and he also worked in pure watercolour. His 1812 lesson book <span class="italic">The Progress of a Water-Coloured Drawing</span> illustrates both his teaching and his painting technique. Step-by-step instructions were fashionable, but Laporte's guide was more than a painting-by-numbers exercise, since the pupil was supposed to create the basic composition. The sample composition was typically Claudian, and the insistence on a &#145;dead coloured&#146; grey ground for distance was also becoming old-fashioned. Laporte did not join the Society of Painters in Water Colours, but was a member of the rival Associated Artists in Water-Colours which held exhibitions between 1808 and 1812. This does not imply a break with Wells, since in 1819 they collaborated on a series of seventy-two soft-ground etchings after landscape drawings by Gainsborough. His other publications were <span class="italic">Characters of Trees</span> (1798&#150;1801), <span class="italic">A Drawing Book</span> (1800), and <span class="italic">Progressive Lessons Sketched from Nature</span> (1804). He died from &#145;decay of nature&#146; at 2 Upper Coleshill Street, Pimlico, on 8 July 1839. Examples of his work are in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the art galleries at Aberdeen, Accrington, Leeds, Leicester, and Newport.<br>
<br>Laporte's daughter Mary Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1795) painted portraits and fancy subjects. She exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution from 1813 to 1821, and was a member of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours from 1835 until 1846, when she retired because of ill health. Laporte's son <a name="cosubject_16063"></a><span class="headword">George Henry Laporte</span>  (1802&#150;1873), <span class="occ">animal and military painter</span>, worked in both oil and watercolour, shared his father's address until 1827 or before, and may well have been taught by H. B. Chalon. He exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere from 1818, and was a member of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours from 1834. He was animal painter to the duke of Cumberland and king of Hanover from 1836, and he contributed forty-three plates to the <span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>. His work declined after the 1830s, when both horses and landscapes had shown considerable strength. He died at 13 Norfolk Square, Paddington, on 23 October 1873. His wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Elgie, whom he married in the autumn of 1850, predeceased him, and their only child, Georgina Dora Laporte (1852&#150;1884), died unmarried.<br>
