<span class="headword">Lloyd <span class="st"> [Floyd]</span>,  Nicholas</span>  (1630?&#150;1680), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and scholar</span>, was born, according to his own statement, at the parsonage house, Wonston, near Winchester, Hampshire, on 28 May 1630, and baptized the Sunday following, 30 May, the son of the Revd George Lloyd 
    (Floyd; 1597/8&#150;1658?)
  . It has since been stated that he was born in 1634 at Holton, Flintshire, Wales. Lloyd's family was indeed Welsh in origin (George Lloyd's father, David Lloyd, was of Merioneth, Wales). Lloyd had at least three brothers (the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16844/', "John Lloyd")</script>, George, and Edward) and three sisters. His familial affections were strong, judging from his commonplace book, dated 1656, which contains Latin verses on the deaths of two sisters and, in 1655, his brother Edward. In April 1657 he himself may have narrowly escaped death from smallpox.<br>
<br>Educated at home by his father until 1643, Lloyd was admitted scholar of Winchester College on 3 September 1644. He left on 26 September 1651 and matriculated at Oxford University, entering Hart Hall on 13 May 1652. On 20 October 1653 he was admitted scholar of Wadham College, where he had a distinguished career and lived, it appears, in the &#145;Second Middle Chamber from the Chapel&#146;  (Gardiner, 198). He proceeded BA on 16 January 1656 and MA on 6 July 1658 and held many offices at Wadham, including bursar, catechist, humanity lecturer (1659), university rhetoric reader (1665), and sub-warden (1666, 1670). He was also rector of St Martin Carfax, Oxford (1665&#150;70). In 1665 Dr Walter Blandford, bishop of Oxford and subsequently of Worcester, appointed Lloyd his chaplain, and Lloyd accompanied him to Worcester in the early 1670s.<br>
<br>A modest man, who respected and encouraged the scholarship of others, Lloyd was &#145;a deare and intimate acquaintance&#146; of Oxford historiographer and antiquarian Anthony Wood  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 2.197). Between November 1669 and June 1670 the two were frequently together at Oxford taverns and coffee houses such as Pont's, Pinnock's, Mother Jeanses', the Fleur-de-lis, and the Crown. During this period Wood recorded over thirty shared evenings with Lloyd, many in company with William Thornton. To Lloyd, who highly praised the work, Wood submitted the manuscript of his history of the city and university of Oxford (first published in Latin translation, 1674). Unhappily for both men, and especially embarrassing for Lloyd, who personally extended the invitation to his friend, the warden of Wadham College, Gilbert Ironside, invited them to supper on 29 October 1674 and in the course of the evening toasted Lloyd in claret and proceeded to insult Wood and metaphorically roast Wood's book  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 2.296&#150;7).<br>
<br>In 1670 Lloyd published a revision and enlargement of Charles Estienne's compendious <span class="italic">Dictionarium historicum, geographicum, poeticum</span>; this was the product of twenty years of Lloyd's labour, for which he drew on classical sources, the church fathers, and modern authors on geography and pagan antiquity. He &#145;made it quite another thing, by adding thereunto, from his great reading, almost as much more matter as there was before, with many corrections, &amp;c.&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1259). The first edition having quickly sold, Lloyd continued to revise and expand the work. Though appointed rector of St Mary's, Newington, Surrey, on 28 April 1673, he did not live there until 23 August 1677. He died from what his doctors described as &#145;a dropsy in the stomack&#146; on 27 November 1680, the parish register recording that he and Herbert Rogers, parish clerk, &#145;both lay dead and unburied at the same time, Dec. 1, 1680&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D32, fol. 22<i>r</i>; Burn, 112). Lloyd was buried in the chancel with no memorial, &#145;leaving then behind him, among those that well knew him, the character of an harmless quiet man, and of an excellent philologist&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.1259). His unpublished writings, chiefly commentaries and translations, were &#145;retrieved from being made Waste Paper&#146; after his brother John's death  (Aubrey, 5.140). Posthumously, in 1686, Lloyd's second edition of Estienne's dictionary (completed only shortly before Lloyd's death) was published. His extensive private library, consisting of 1088 volumes (159 theology, 428 philology and history, 18 medical, and 483 &#145;English&#146;) and 297 pamphlets, fell under a London auction hammer on 4 July 1681.<br>
