<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heywood,  Oliver</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1630, <em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was the third son of Richard Heywood (1595/6&#150;1677), yeoman, of Little Lever in the parish of Bolton, Lancashire, and his first wife, Alice Critchlaw (1593&#150;1657) of Longworth; he was baptized in the parish church at Bolton on 15 March 1630. The neighbourhood had a long tradition of evangelical protestantism stretching back to the Edwardian preacher and Marian martyr John Bradford, and Oliver's parents were leading members of the puritan godly, ensuring that the sign of the cross was not used at their son's baptism. Oliver's mother participated in iconoclasm at Bolton in 1641 and introduced her son to the round of sermon attendance characteristic of puritan piety. His father, who prospered in the cloth trade, also built up a library of godly authors and reformation classics and Oliver was sent to Bolton grammar school and to study with William Rathband, the suspended curate at Little Lever. By his own account, however, his most important teacher before going up to Cambridge was a Mr Rudal, probably George Rudhall, schoolmaster of Horwich in the adjacent parish of Deane, from whom he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in July 1647. His tutor there was Alexander Akehurst, who later became a Quaker, and Heywood joined fellow students in a religious society which met in the rooms of Thomas Jollie, who became a lifelong friend and associate. As a student he was greatly influenced by the preaching of Samuel Hammond at St Giles's Church.<h2>
<a name="ColeyChapel16501662"></a>Coley Chapel, 1650&#150;1662</h2>Heywood graduated BA in 1650 and returned home intending to enter the household of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/550/', "John Angier")</script> of Denton, Lancashire, as part of his further training for the ministry. He soon began to preach in the neighbourhood and at Skipton in Yorkshire, near where other members of the family lived. As a result of this, and on the recommendation of his uncle, Francis Critchlaw, Heywood came to the attention of the congregation at Coley, one of twelve chapelries in the extensive parish of Halifax and, after preaching there at Michaelmas, he accepted the invitation to become its preacher on 26 November 1650 at a stipend of &pound;30 a year, &pound;20 of which came from contributions by the congregation. The parish of Halifax, and its chapelries, had been a noted puritan centre before the civil wars and at his arrival there Heywood would find several like-minded clergy in the area. Even so he was very young to assume ministerial responsibilities but, although under age, was ordained by the Bury classis on 4 August 1652. He soon enjoyed the support and company of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13184/', "Nathaniel Heywood")</script>, who had been appointed to the chapelry of Illingworth in the same parish and with whom he shared a house, and of another old Cambridge friend, Eli Bentley, who became assistant minister at Halifax in 1653. On 24 April 1655 Heywood married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1661), the daughter of John Angier, in her father's church at Denton, and they moved to live at Northowram. In the same year Heywood introduced a monthly celebration of the communion to Coley for the first time since the outbreak of the civil wars and in 1657 he linked this to the setting up of an eldership and presbyterian church discipline. This split the congregation, with many of the more prosperous members opposing him, though the majority remained on his communicants' list. Despite these divisions Heywood persisted in establishing the discipline and was determined to remain at Coley, rejecting offers to undertake ministries at York and Preston which his reputation as a pastor and his wide connections among the northern godly had put his way.<br>
<br>By the late 1650s Heywood had become a royalist presbyterian and was arrested and threatened with deprivation for refusing to give public thanksgiving for the suppression of the insurrection led by George Booth in 1659. When he heard of Monck's declaration for the king he recorded the news in his diary with a psalm of praise, but the Restoration soon brought his official ministry to an end. He quickly ran into conflict with Richard Hooke, the new vicar of Halifax, over rights of baptism in the outlying chapelries, and at the beginning of 1661 a private fast he was conducting was stopped by authority. Within his own congregation there was a group, headed by Stephen Ellis of Hipperholme, the most substantial resident, who wanted to restore the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and a copy was placed before Heywood in the church on 25 August 1661. Heywood ignored it and was cited before the church courts on 13 September for nonconformity; proceedings dragged on until 29 June 1662 when he was suspended from ministering within the diocese. He continued to preach for a few weeks but was excommunicated following the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662, the decree being read at Halifax and Bolton. His first wife died on 26 May 1661, leaving him with two young sons, John and Eliezar, another having died in infancy; on 27 June 1667 he married Abigail Crompton, daughter of James Crompton of Breightmet in Lancashire, who died in 1707.<h2>
<a name="Rovingministry16621685"></a>Roving ministry, 1662&#150;1685</h2>Heywood was formally excluded from preaching but, in the years immediately following, his extensive family connections and his reputation led to his being invited to several pulpits on both sides of the Pennines. In addition he continued to hold conventicles and private fasts in the homes of presbyterian gentry and farmers throughout the region and at York, where Sarah, Lady Hewley, was a supporter. Following the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> he left his home at Coley and became an itinerant preacher throughout the north, returning in January 1668 to his old chapel, where he preached to a large congregation. He was arrested on 13 March 1670 after preaching at Little Woodhouse near Leeds, but released two days later; however, in July his goods were distrained to meet the fine required under the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>, which had just come into force. Following the declaration of indulgence in 1672 he took out two licences as a presbyterian teacher, one for his own house at Northowram and the other for the house of John Butterworth of Warley in Halifax parish. On 12 June over 100 of his former congregation entered into a church covenant with him, which though presbyterian in inspiration was sufficiently broad to enable the members of the congregational chapel at Sowerby, leaderless since the death of Henry Root, to join with them on 19 June. On 29 October that year Heywood took part in a presbyterian ordination in the house of Robert Eaton, another ejected minister, at Deansgate, Manchester.<br>
<br>The licences were revoked in February 1675 and Heywood set off on his travels once again, covering several hundred miles a year on his preaching tours. His labours were critical in keeping the dissenting congregations in touch with each other, and on 8 July 1678 he assisted at the first presbyterian ordination in Yorkshire. During these years he was also active in furthering his message through print, and published a number of books of practical divinity in the puritan mode which he distributed widely, and for free, among his friends and congregations: among the more important of these were <span class="italic">Heart-Treasure</span> (1667), based on sermons preached at Coley and dedicated to the congregation there, <span class="italic">Closet Prayer, a Christian Duty</span> (1671), and <span class="italic">Life in God's Favour</span> (1679), and the distribution lists for these provide a valuable insight into dissenting networks and patrons throughout the north. He continued this pattern of roving ministry from the base at his house in Northowram, occasionally harassed by the authorities but escaping serious persecution until 1685. On 16 January that year he was arrested for riotous assembly at his house and he spent the rest of the year, until 19 December, as a prisoner in York Castle for his refusal to pay the &pound;50 fine.<h2>
<a name="NorthowramChapel16881702"></a>Northowram Chapel, 1688&#150;1702</h2>The declaration of indulgence granted by James II in 1687 provided Heywood with the opportunity to regularize his position once again, and he set about building a meeting-house in Northowram on land he had provided, which was opened on 8 July 1688; a school was added in 1693. The meeting-house was licensed under the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> on 18 July 1689. Throughout his life Heywood was interested in cases of witchcraft and possession, noting many in his diaries and attending fasts and prayers associated with some cases. In September 1689 he joined with several other nonconformist divines in attending fasts associated with the case of Richard Dugdale, the Surey Demoniack, but took no part in the defence of those ministers subsequently implicated in what was later revealed as a fraud.<br>
<br>In September 1691 Heywood played a leading role in introducing into Yorkshire the &#145;happy union&#146; between Presbyterians and Independents agreed in London earlier that year, preaching to a meeting of ministers and licensed preachers of both denominations at Wakefield on 2 September when heads of agreement were adopted. Further meetings were arranged throughout the West Riding at which ordinations were arranged and preaching licences granted. Having weathered his difficulties with the established church Heywood spent much of the 1690s concerned about the extent to which he perceived some of his fellow dissenters had departed from the strict Calvinist tradition in which he had been formed, and though his views on individuals remained for the most part characteristically generous he regretted the falling away in doctrinal orthodoxy which the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> had permitted. He continued his pastoral activities and preached throughout the Pennine region throughout the decade, being viewed as something of a patriarchal figure by younger colleagues, many of whom sought his advice and whose pulpits he often shared. The extent of his labours in this work were recorded by him in a list covering the years from 1665 until his death: in 1690, in addition to his Sunday preaching, he preached 135 sermons, conducted forty fasts and seventeen days of thanksgiving, and travelled a total of 1100 miles, a lesser distance than he recorded in the three previous years. In 1700 his asthmatic condition deteriorated but he continued to preach forty-five weekday sermons, conduct twenty-two fasts and three days of thanksgiving, and attend eight conferences of ministers, travelling in all 145 miles.<br>
<br>By this date, though more closely restricted to his Northowram congregation, Heywood's wider ministry was maintained through the writing of seven treatises and an extensive correspondence of 147 letters written in that, his seventieth year. This public preaching ministry was complemented by a pastoral one in which Heywood's status as a healer and the reputation he had for powerful prayer meant that he was often asked to attend those who were ill or in distress, one on occasion being so moved by the tears of a mother for her son who had been hanged that he went off to pray with her and her family. More commonly he regularly attended the elderly and women in childbed, and was frequently asked to give advice on personal matters by nonconformists throughout the region, many of them calling at his home in Northowram. Despite his failing health Heywood continued to preach in his meeting-house there, though from 5 December 1701 he had to be carried to it in a chair&#151;as had Calvin, he noted in his diary. He died at Northowram on 4 May 1702 and was buried three days later in Halifax parish church, being laid in his mother's tomb in Holdsworth's chapel in the south aisle. It says much for his reputation throughout the region that the funeral was attended by a large gathering of clergy, from both the established church and the dissenting congregations.<br>
<br>Heywood's life formed a bridge between the puritan tradition of early and mid-century England, the years following the Restoration when dissent was outlawed and many ministers, Heywood included, suffered imprisonment as a result of their preaching, and the years after the revolution of 1688 when toleration was granted and dissenting ministers could operate from settled congregations with their own chapels. Though never party to discussions at national level in a significant way Heywood was the pre-eminent figure in northern nonconformity throughout these years and, as such, his life itself represents a key point of access to the religious history of the period, but even more important than the events of his life is the way in which Heywood recorded them.<h2>
<a name="Writingsandspirituality"></a>Writings and spirituality</h2>This he did in a variety of volumes which owed much to the well-established puritan tradition of recording and interpreting God's providences to both the individual and the wider community, and Heywood's wide kinship networks and public position within dissent make his volumes uniquely important for their mix of both public and private. That mix is revealed in the writings themselves which consist of a diary, begun with his removal from Coley in 1666 following the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> and continuing until his death, an autobiographical account of the years preceding that, reflections of providences and &#145;returns of prayer&#146; covering the years from 1682 until his death, commonplace notes from the sayings of other preachers, biographical notes of his family, notes of church covenants and ministerial meetings in the West Riding, and a &#145;register&#146; of his congregation giving biographical sketches of his neighbours, his fellow dissenters, and other notable individuals. Taken together they reveal more than the internal preoccupations of a dedicated Calvinist minister&#151;an abiding awareness of the force of evil in the world, manifested through witchcraft, drunkenness, or other licentious behaviour, and a conviction that prayer and fasting were the only sure means of overcoming this, and a recording of divine judgement on the ungodly, and the providential reconciling of the misfortunes of the godly; they also record his public activities&#151;relations with his congregation, with his wide cousinage within dissent, and with the authorities in both church and state. In these writings Heywood reveals the depth of his providential Calvinism and the extent to which the events of mid-century had formed his views. Delighted as he was by the declarations of indulgence by Charles II and James II, he noted with concern the implications of these royal edicts for parliamentary government, and the encouragement they gave to papists, one group which always remained outside his inclusive humanity.<br>
<br>Heywood's ministry was founded on prayer, recorded almost daily in his diary and often conducted in company with others. This lay at the heart of his healing ministry, and his conviction in its power led to much deliberation on the workings of God's providence, both in his personal life and in the public life of the church, as well as in the lives of the common stock of humanity. This was revealed in his close recording and meditations on the sudden deaths of those whom he knew personally or of which he learned from others, and especially on those of the ungodly persecutors of nonconformists. Such stress on divine intervention in the world brought Heywood into conflict with the Anglican clergy of the area, and in particular with Dr Hooke, who increasingly looked to natural causes in the explanation of misfortune. Heywood himself eventually became more cautious about invoking divine intervention, especially in cases which related to members of the established church, but it remained true that his life was marked by a constant awareness of his own and his associates' relationship with their maker. This clearly drew on the puritan tradition of the earlier seventeenth century, but it also reflected his contemporary position for much of his life as a minister barred from following his true vocation and regularly harassed by the authorities for attempting to practise it. He recorded his views in <span class="italic">Israel's Lamentation after the Lord</span> (1683) when he wrote, &#145;It is dreadful indeed to see debauchery in the land abounding, and the basest of men vent personal malice against God's dearest children for no other fault than worshipping God, and praying for their persecutors&#146;  (p. 390). It is no surprise that he began his diary after the introduction of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span>.<br>
<br>Heywood was a prominent figure among his fellow ministers, often presiding at their meetings. He recorded the lives of his contemporaries, providing Edmund Calamy with much material for his study of those ejected in 1662. He published a life of his father-in-law, John Angier, and also wrote a biography of Richard Frankland, who ran the dissenting academy attended by his sons. His pastoral writings continued to the end of his life, with a flurry of publications, most of which he financed himself, from the later 1690s when his health made travel less easy. They continued in the vein of practical divinity established in his earlier works, though with an increasing concern with preparation for death, comfort for mourners and the after-life, and they make frequent reference to the writings of contemporaries such as Richard Baxter and Henry Newcome, as well as reminding his readers of their heritage going back to the Marian martyrs. It was this which formed the argument of his final volume, entitled <span class="italic">The Two Worlds; Present and Future, Visible and Invisible</span> (1701) and dedicated to his relations living in Lancashire, in which he urged them to hold fast to the observance of their ancestors.<h2>
<a name="Heywoodslegacies"></a>Heywood's legacies</h2>Heywood's sons both proceeded to the ministry, John at Rotherham and Pontefract, and Eliezar in the Sheffield area. Heywood's income from his congregation was always modest but he acquired an extensive library, numbering 265 titles when listed in 1664 and valued at &pound;20 at his death. This he left to be divided between his two sons, his widow first having choice of ten volumes. He also acquired lands in Ovenden and Sowerby in the parish of Halifax to add to his property at Northowram and to the estate at Little Lever which he had inherited. His widow was given a life interest in certain of the properties and the estate then passed to his two sons, with the house in Ovenden going to a grandson, Timothy. Heywood's goods were valued at &pound;132 at the time of his death, and reveal a modest if well-appointed house, with a portrait of himself hanging in the parlour. No monument was erected to him, though the chapel in Northowram, rebuilt in the nineteenth century, bears his name. In the absence of an epitaph his own review of his life, written on 15 March 1695, can stand as an assessment of his motives and achievement:<blockquote>that I should be a publick preacher above 44 yeares, have such measure of health, liberty, opportunitys, more then most of my brethren, some good successe and fruit of my poor labours, marry famous Mr Angier's daughter, print so many bookes, injoy so many comforts of life, bring up two sons to be ministers, build a chappel, help so many ministers and Christians in their necessitys by my self and others, and yet have a competency my self and wife to live upon, nothing more improbable then these things and many more experiments I might produce, which I record not for ostentation but to set off the riches of grace. (<span class="italic">Oliver Heywood</span>, ed. Turner, 3.297)</blockquote>
