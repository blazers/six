<span class="headword">Capel,  Thomas John</span>  (1836&#150;1911), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, born at Ardmore, co. Waterford, on 28 October 1836, was the eldest son of John Capel and his wife, Mary Fitzgerald. His father, after service in the navy, joined the coastguard service and was stationed at Hastings, where Thomas received his early education from the parish priest before being placed in the care of the Revd J. M. Glennie, a Tractarian convert to Roman Catholicism resident at Brook Green, Hammersmith. In 1851 Glennie became the founding principal of St Mary's Roman Catholic Teacher Training College at Brook Green, and in 1853 Capel was one of the first students to obtain a teaching certificate there. From 1854 he taught at the normal school attached to the college, while studying for the priesthood. He was ordained priest by Cardinal Wiseman in his private chapel at York Place on 28 August 1859. Unusually, he did not attend a seminary, so it must be presumed that he was ordained on his own patrimony. The source of his private income is unknown.<br>
<br>In 1863 Capel retired for reasons of health to Pau, in the Basses-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, where he acted as English Catholic chaplain, earned a reputation as a preacher and controversialist, and made some fashionable converts. While there he became acquainted with Charles Scott Murray, the patron of A. W. Pugin, who on his return to England in 1867 engaged him as his chaplain at Danesfield, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Scott Murray introduced him to John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, third marquess of Bute, then an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford, who adopted him as his spiritual director. In 1868 he paid several visits to Oxford, where his eloquence and charm produced an outbreak of Roman fever among the undergraduates of Christ Church, to the alarm of Dean Liddell. According to Bute, on the last day of his visit in December, after having &#145;operated privately on some rationalists&#146; he drew an &#145;immense congregation&#146; to his sermon at the Catholic chapel in St Clements  (Blair, 71&#150;2). Capel's reception of Bute into the Roman Catholic church on 8 December 1868 attracted much publicity. Early in 1869 he and Bute departed from Nice on the latter's yacht for a cruise to the Holy Land, calling <i>en route</i> at Rome, where they had a private audience of Pope Pius IX, who appointed Capel a papal chamberlain, with the title of Monsignor.<br>
<br>Attached to the pro-cathedral at Kensington on his return to England in 1869, Capel rapidly made his mark in London society and won over a number of titled converts. In 1870 he appeared, thinly disguised, as the worldly-wise and casuistical Monsignor Catesby in Disraeli's novel <span class="italic">Lothair</span> (1870). Two years later life converged with art when in April 1872 Disraeli was one of the witnesses at the wedding of Bute (Lothair) in Brompton Oratory, Capel celebrating the nuptial mass and Manning (Cardinal Grandison) performing the ceremony. On 7 September 1872, in its &#145;Men of the day&#146; series, <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> profiled Capel as an &#145;apostle to the genteel&#146;, &#145;if not an admirer, at least a great controller of the fair sex&#146;, who had &#145;probably made and unmade more important marriages than any man or mamma in the country&#146;.<br>
<br>In February 1873, with the backing of the duke of Norfolk and Lord Petre, Capel opened a Catholic public school at Kensington which was intended to attract the sons of the Catholic aristocracy away from Eton and Harrow. Impressed by his dynamism, Cardinal Manning appointed him in 1874 to the rectorship of his Catholic university which opened at Kensington in January 1875. The appointment was unanimously approved by the English Catholic hierarchy. The staff included scholars of the calibre of St G. Jackson Mivart, Frederick Apthorp Paley, and Charles Stanton Devas, and in three years the number of undergraduates rose from seventeen to fifty, but the scheme was handicapped by the opposition of the Jesuits and by a lack of co-operation from Newman, who declined an invitation to become a member of the senate. Capel devoted his principal energies to his school, and there were complaints that the university students were inadequately supervised. In 1878 a committee of investigation discovered that Capel had kept no accounts and was heavily in debt. On being requested to resign he threatened to sue the hierarchy for damages, and in order to avoid the scandal of a court case Manning was obliged to come to a private financial settlement. The university was wound up and Capel's school also closed, its patrons having withdrawn their support. A further charge of misconduct, involving young women, led to his suspension by Manning. Capel vigorously denied the charges and carried the case to Rome, where he had influential allies. In September 1882 he secured an acquittal, but Manning threatened to resign his see if he were allowed to return to England, and appealed to a higher authority. By a decree of 6 February 1887, valid worldwide, Capel was finally suspended from the exercise of his priestly faculties.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1883 Capel had migrated to the United States, where he undertook a highly successful lecture tour of the eastern and mid-western states before settling in 1885 at San Francisco, where he lived in some style. In 1886 he took up permanent residence at Arno Ranch, near Galt, in northern California, as the guest of Mrs Alice Valensin, whose son he tutored. He continued to publish pamphlets in defence of ultramontane doctrine, and was befriended by Thomas Grace, the bishop of Sacramento, at whose residence he died on 23 October 1911. The entry he supplied to the <span class="italic">American Catholic Who's Who</span> of 1911 gives a somewhat misleading account of his meteoric career.<br>
