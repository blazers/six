<span class="headword">Kaye,  Mary Margaret <span class="st"> [Mollie]</span></span>  (1908&#150;2004), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 21 August 1908, in Simla, the summer capital of British India in the Himalayan foothills, one of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53776/', "Sir Cecil Kaye (1868&#150;1935)")</script>, director of the Central Intelligence Bureau of India and a senior member of the Indian Civil Service, and his wife, Margaret Sarah (Daisy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bryson, a missionary's daughter and watercolour artist. At the age of ten, having been taught to speak Hindustani by her <i>ayah</i> (maidservant) alongside English by her parents, she was packed off to be turned into a prim and proper English lady, at the Lawn School, Clevedon, Somerset, a place she found &#145;cold and colourless&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 31 Jan 2004). Much the same fate befell her brother, Bill, and her sister, Bets (Betty). After leaving school she learned how to illustrate children's books at art college. Happily, when her father was sent back from England to India in 1926 to help revise British treaties with princely states, she accompanied him but resisted her parents' attempts to have her married off to a suitable English officer.<br>
<br>After her father retired and died in India in 1935, Kaye, short of money, was forced to make England her base for a while. But she went back to India again, financed by the handy sum of &pound;65 she had earned from illustrating children's books. She stayed in Simla where she shared a home with her sister. The fateful &#145;love at first sight&#146; meeting with Godfrey John (Goff) Hamilton (1912&#150;1985), an officer in the Queen's Own corps of guides, took place on 2 June 1941, in Kashmir. He was married with a daughter. Ignoring the traditional morality of the day, Kaye plunged into an affair with Hamilton, became pregnant, and had Carolyn, the first of their two daughters, in 1943. (She later recounted that outside her window, while she was in the throes of childbirth, a tiger was feasting on a water buffalo it had killed.) After Hamilton had obtained a divorce, the couple were married in India on armistice day, 11 November 1945. Her second daughter, Nicola (Nikki), was born in 1946.<br>
<br>After Indian independence in 1947 it was a wrench for Kaye to leave India but she had to do so when her husband opted to join the British army. As a loyal army wife, she moved with him &#145;22 times in 17 years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 31 Jan 2004) but this gave authorship the chance to flourish. His last post was as chief of the joint services liaison organization, British army of the Rhine, from 1963 to 1966, after which he retired, with the rank of major-general. He and Mollie then settled in Pevensey, Sussex, a county she picked &#145;because Kipling lived here&#146;; he had been her favourite author since hearing her father read <span class="italic">The Jungle Book</span> to her at the age of four  (<span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span>, 13 Oct 1978).<br>
<br>Kaye had not intended to be a writer but became one accidentally when she felt she could do better than some of the authors whose books she was illustrating. In 1940 she published her first novel, <span class="italic">Six Bars at Seven</span>, as Mollie Kaye, and under the same name brought out <span class="italic">Night on the Island</span> (later renamed <span class="italic">Strange Island</span>) four years later. There followed (as M. M. Kaye) a series of detective novels, among them <span class="italic">Death Walks in Kashmir</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Death Walks in Berlin</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Death Walks in Cyprus</span> (1956), and <span class="italic">Later Than You Think</span> (1958), the latter written while her husband's regiment was fighting the Mau Mau in Kenya. <span class="italic">Shadow of the Moon</span>, her first historical novel, set in the India of 1857, appeared in 1957. <span class="italic">Trade Wind</span> (1963), another historical tale of conflicting cultures, was set in Zanzibar. There were also a number of children's stories: <span class="italic">Potter Pinner Meadow</span> (1937), <span class="italic">Black Bramble Wood</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Willow Witches Brook</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Gold Gorse Common</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Ordinary Princess</span> (1980), and <span class="italic">Thistledown</span> (1981).<br>
<br>Kaye's grandfather, father, brother, and husband (not to mention uncles and cousins) all served the raj. Although she was a prolific author her whole life appeared to provide source material for her most successful novel, <span class="italic">The Far Pavilions</span> (1978), about a romance between an English army officer, Ashton Pelham-Martyn, and Anjuli, an Indian princess, in nineteenth-century India. The novel spanned the years between the Indian uprising of 1857 (known in Britain as the Sepoy or Indian Mutiny but in India as the First War of Independence) and the Second Afghan War of 1878&#150;80. It helped that one of Kaye's grandfather's cousins, Edward Kaye, commanded a battery during the siege of Delhi in 1857, while his brother, John Kaye, wrote the official histories of the First Afghan War and the events of 1857. There was a great deal of Goff Hamilton, a dashing soldier who had won a DSO at twenty-three when he was serving on the north-west frontier, which she later put into the character of Pelham-Martyn. Fiction and reality got mixed up when one of her husband's ancestors, Walter Hamilton VC, who perished while defending the British residency in Kabul, was also worked into the novel. She wrote the book in England and took fifteen years to do so, but visited the India of her childhood, especially Rajasthan, to carry out characteristically meticulous research. On publication the novel was immediately recognized as a classic of its kind, with an American reviewer comparing it with Margaret Mitchell's <span class="italic">Gone with the Wind</span>. By the time of Kaye's death it had sold at least 15 million copies in sixteen languages. In drawing the central character of the hero, Ashton Pelham-Martyn, who grows up as a happy Indian street urchin, Ashok, in the dusty lanes of India, before being sent off to public school in England to be turned unwillingly into a pukka sahib, she created the opposite of what would be called a &#145;coconut&#146;&#151;here was someone who was white on the outside and brown inside. This probably described Kaye's own sentiments exactly. Although she saw nothing intrinsically wrong with the principle of the raj, she considered India, not England, to be her real home, and never lost her genuine love of the country. In 1984 <span class="italic">The Far Pavilions</span> was turned into a six-hour mini television series on Channel 4. Although the cast included Ben Cross, Amy Irving, Omar Sharif, Christopher Lee, and Sir John Gielgud, the production did not do justice to the novel.<br>
<br>Kaye (who was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1980) had formed a firm friendship with fellow author Paul Scott, to whom she provided useful background on India, since he had little personal knowledge of the period in which he set the <span class="roman">Raj Quartet</span> (1966&#150;75). It is said she even suggested the theme of his novel <span class="italic">Staying On</span> (1977). It was intriguing for both to discover that in 1951 Kaye had actually met Scott when he was handling her manuscripts for Pearn, Pollinger, and Higham, a literary agency for whom he then worked. He admitted to having had reservations about her early work but expressed great enthusiasm for <span class="italic">The Far Pavilions</span>, and she for all his output.<br>
<br>Two years after her husband's death in 1985&#151;she had considered their forty-year marriage to be near perfect&#151;a devastated Kaye moved in with her sister in a wing of a house belonging to one of her daughters, in Hampshire, moving to Lavenham, Suffolk, in 2001. In her closing years she painted an idyllic portrait of British India in three volumes of autobiography, <span class="italic">The Sun in the Morning</span> (1990), <span class="italic">Golden Afternoon</span> (1997), and <span class="italic">Enchanted Evening</span> (1999). She was planning a fourth at the time of her death. In March 2003 she was awarded the Colonel James Tod international award by the Maharana Mewar Foundation of Udaipur in Rajasthan for her &#145;contribution of permanent value reflecting the spirit and value of Mewar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Express</span>, 24 March 2003). She extended enthusiastic support to Michael Ward, like her born in India, who was passionate about producing a musical version of <span class="italic">The Far Pavilions</span>. The novel, dealing with divided loyalties and dual identities, had resonance for a multicultural Britain at the start of the twenty-first century. Kaye warned Ward that were she to fall off her perch before the curtain went up, &#145;I shall make an awful nuisance of myself in the next life unless I am allowed back to see it run!&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 5 Feb 2004). She died on 29 January 2004 at Ropers House, High Street, Lavenham, of cerebrovascular disease. She was survived by her two daughters. The musical <span class="italic">The Far Pavilions</span> opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End a year later, a chair being kept empty on the first night in memory of the author. In March 2006 her ashes were taken to India by Ward and his wife, Elaine. Wearing traditional Indian clothes, they rowed to the middle of Lake Pichola in Udaipur, waited until the sun started to dip behind the ramparts of the City Palace, and scattered Kaye's ashes into the water. Her family observed the exact moment back in England and her daughter Nikki remarked: &#145;<span class="italic">The Far Pavilions</span> was my mother's love letter to India &hellip; India was home for mother. She saw India through an Indian eye, not a European one&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 7 March 2006).<br>
