<span class="headword">Strathbogie,  John  of</span>, ninth earl of Atholl  (<em>c.</em>1260&#150;1306), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of David of Strathbogie, earl of Atholl, who died on crusade at Tunis in 1270 and who was the grandson of David Hastings, a previous holder of the earldom, and his wife, Forueleth. David of Strathbogie married, as his second wife, Isabella Chilham, heir to lands in Kent and Dover and a granddaughter of Richard, a bastard of King John of England. Their son, John, a minor at his father's death, was placed under the care of his mother's second husband, Alexander de Balliol of Cavers. He appears to have reached his majority by 1284, when he began to take part in affairs of state.<br>
<br>Despite being a Bruce supporter during the Great Cause, Atholl was present when John, king of Scots (John de Balliol) did homage to Edward I in 1292, and he ratified the treaty with France in February 1296. A month later he invaded England under the earl of Buchan, and shortly afterwards was captured at Dunbar. Atholl gained release from the Tower of London in 1297 by serving with Edward in Flanders. On his return to Scotland, he may have fought in the battle of Falkirk on the patriotic side; he was certainly with the Scots in 1299, taking part in a raid on the south-east of the country and the meeting of the Scottish political community at Peebles. In February 1300, as sheriff of Aberdeen, he attended the justiciar's court held by John Comyn, earl of Buchan, although Buchan's younger brother, Sir Alexander Comyn, claimed to be sheriff of Aberdeen for King Edward. Atholl had an interest in north-east Scotland through his estates of Stratha'an and Strathbogie. A few months later he attended the parliament at Rutherglen, siding with the bishop of St Andrews against John Comyn the younger of Badenoch, during an argument between the two.<br>
<br>The earl probably submitted to Edward during the latter's campaign in north-east Scotland in 1303, and was appointed warden and justiciar north of the Forth on 29 March 1304. His deputy was the earl of Strathearn. In that office he complained to the king about the power invested in his old enemy, Sir Alexander Comyn, who now held four castles in the area; Edward duly reduced them to two. Atholl also presided over a case involving his deputy, Strathearn, concerned, ironically, with the activities of the patriotic government of which he had been part. In 1305 he was ordered to find a site for a new castle that Edward was intending to build &#145;in a good place beyond the Forth&#146;  (<span class="italic">CDS</span>, vol. 2, no. 1722). Around July he complained to the king about the insufficiency of his fee; although Edward attempted to deal with his complaints, the earl, like others before and after him, was left with doubts as to the value of English service.<br>
<br>Despite remaining at Berwick immediately after the murder of John Comyn in February 1306, Atholl joined Robert Bruce, his former brother-in-law, in time for the latter's inauguration at Scone; he was one of only three earls present. It is possible that he was responsible for the presence there of Isabel, countess of Buchan. After the battle of Methven he was given charge of the queen and of his own niece, Marjory Bruce, taking them from Kildrummy to the sanctuary at Tain, where they were later captured. Atholl himself was seized after being shipwrecked in the Moray Firth in August 1306. Taken to London, on 7 November 1306 he was hanged on a gallows 30 feet higher than usual (in deference to his English royal blood), then decapitated and burnt.<br>
<br>Although engaged to a daughter of Sir William Soulis in 1286, Atholl certainly married Marjory, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18020/', "Donald, sixth earl of Mar")</script>, and sister of Isabel, the first wife of Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick (later Robert I). Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54330/', "David Strathbogie")</script>, became earl of Atholl on his father's death, but he was in English hands at that time. Having been sent to defend Dundee Castle, Earl David submitted to King Robert with the rest of the English garrison in 1312 and was made constable of Scotland. He deserted the Scots on the eve of the battle of Bannockburn, apparently because Edward Bruce had seduced his sister, and remained on the English side thereafter.<br>
