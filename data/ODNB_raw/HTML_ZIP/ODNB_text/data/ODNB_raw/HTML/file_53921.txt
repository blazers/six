<span class="headword">Farquharson,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1675&#150;1739), <span class="occ">teacher of mathematics and navigation in Russia</span>, was a son of John Farquharson (<i>d</i>. before 1691), from a branch of the family at Milton, Whitehouse, in west Aberdeenshire. He graduated after broadly based studies as Milne bursar (1691&#150;5) at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and became Liddel mathematical tutor. In April 1698 he was probably introduced by the marquess of Carmarthen in London to the visiting tsar of Russia, Peter the Great, who recruited him to head the mathematics and navigation school planned for Moscow. Following a verbal contract with the Russian ambassador, Farquharson, together with Stephen Gwyn (<i>d</i>. 1720) and Richard Grice (<i>d</i>. 1709), students from the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital, sailed to Archangel on the <i>Royal Transport</i>, a fast schooner given by William III to Peter, reaching the port in June 1698. Temporarily overlooked by the tsar, they lived for a year in the Moscow house of Henry Crevett, an influential English merchant, and began teaching a few pupils. Their petitions in December 1700 and January 1701 for pay, lodgings, and a school in which to teach, resulted in a government decree founding the Mathematics and Navigation School in an old linen mill on 14 January 1701. However in June of that year the school was transferred to the Sukharev Tower, Moscow's recently renovated tallest secular building; originally one of the city gates, it housed Russia's earliest observatory, and survived until the Stalin era. The school, modelled on Christ's Hospital, ran two preliminary courses, the first, arithmetic under the gifted teacher Leonty Magnitsky (1664&#150;1734), leading to the navigation section, where mathematics, trigonometry, astronomy, navigation, and surveying were taught. Farquharson, who was also answerable for all practical arrangements, initially gave lessons in Latin through an interpreter but came to speak Russian very well. By July 1703 there were 200 pupils; numbers rose to 500 within a few years, and 1200 specialists graduated from the school between 1701 and 1715. In the early 1700s Farquharson belonged to a select quasi-masonic Neptune Society, of which the tsar was warden, meeting in the Sukharev Tower. The tsar, fascinated by astronomy, supplied Farquharson with the telescopes, instruments, and books he requested, and corresponded with him about eclipses during his journeys. Farquharson and Gwyn were also members of the Glorious British Monastery, or a convivial &#145;bung club&#146;. The school itself gave music and amateur stage performances on Sundays and holidays. Farquharson also proposed, and from 1705 to 1710 headed, a survey for a direct road between Moscow and St Petersburg via Novgorod which when completed, in 1718, saved 135 miles of travelling distance. In January 1709 the somewhat impetuous Grice was murdered on a late evening ride through Moscow's streets. Subsequently Farquharson himself narrowly escaped a similar fate.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1715 Peter the Great founded the naval academy at St Petersburg in Kikin's House, the present site of the Winter Palace, or Hermitage Museum. Farquharson as senior professor of mathematics and Gwyn, as professor of navigation (until his death in 1720), moved to St Petersburg in January 1716 with 300 advanced students from the navigation section at Moscow where the Mathematics School remained under Magnitsky. Farquharson had a salary of over &pound;500 per annum, free accommodation in the building shared with the Admiralty pharmacy, and allowances for beer and for food for his horse. The academy was headed by a president, with a director under him, but Farquharson assumed responsibility for its practical management and for all educational matters. He and a Russian colleague formulated the curriculum covering, in addition to mathematics and navigation, drawing, fencing, artillery, and fortification&#151;some time after 1722 Farquharson was made lieutenant of fortification, entitling him to hereditary noble status. Two hundred and fifteen graduates of the academy entered the Russian navy between 1715 and 1725, many of them sent abroad to complete their training in British, Dutch, Danish, French, and Italian navies.<br>
<br>In 1703 and 1712 Farquharson acted as a consultant to Leibnitz, corresponding with him about scientific affairs and books published in Russia. Charles Whitworth, the British envoy to Russia, also recommended him in March 1713 as a correspondent for astronomy and cold phenomena to a Russian enquiries committee of the Royal Society (which included Newton and Halley), as well as the Scot Robert Erskine FRS (1677&#150;1718), who was the tsar's chief physician and the director of the entire Russian medical services; the outcome of this recommendation is not known. The naval academy served as Russia's first scientific centre before the Academy of Sciences was established in 1725. In 1718&#150;19 the apothecary chancery's library and museum, directed by Erskine, were moved into Kikin's House from Peter's summer palace, along with Erskine's and Archibald Pitcairne's outstanding libraries, later forming the nucleus of the Academy of Sciences' collections. Farquharson, constantly acquiring naval textbooks and scientific literature which he revised and edited for translation into Russian is credited with supervising thirty-eight translated works for his students (the academy had its own printing press in 1721). His joint 1703 translation of Adriaan Vlacq's Latin tables of logarithms, based on Henry Briggs's <span class="italic">Arithmetica logarithmica</span> (1624), was Russia's second published technical book, incorporating Arabic figures which Farquharson introduced to Russia in place of Cyrillic numerals. He also reworked an abridgement of Euclid's <span class="italic">Elements</span>, translated and printed in 1719, as an introduction to Newtonian mathematics. Other subjects edited by him, some printed but many lost in manuscript, comprised navigation, mathematics, trigonometry, astronomy, and cartography. He probably also compiled a navigation manual, dating from 1703 and now in the British Library (Sloane MS 3227), as a guide for his students, and his model yacht, used for illustrating his lectures, is displayed at the Naval Museum in St Petersburg. Farquharson's comprehensive <span class="italic">Cursus mathematicus</span> was ordered to be printed by the Academy of Sciences in January 1735.<br>
<br>In June 1732 the naval academy moved across the River Neva to Prince Dolgoruky's mansion on Vasilyevsky Island, where today's Academy of Arts stands, near the Academy of Sciences building. An expert cartographer, Farquharson helped produce the first Russian bronze engraving of Mercator's map of America in 1715, superintending the country's earliest reliable hydrographic atlas of the Caspian Sea in 1731. During 1738 he co-operated closely with Joseph-Nicolas Delisle, the eminent professor of astronomy at the Academy of Sciences, in drawing up instructions for geodesists whose surveys culminated in the <span class="italic">Atlas Russicus</span> (1745), the first general map of the Russian empire. He made valuable practical suggestions about these instructions in a letter, dated 17 June 1738, to the Academy of Sciences, whose president referred to him in this connection as professor of astronomy. In March 1737 Farquharson was elevated to the fifth highest Russian rank, that of brigadier, in recognition of his selfless and outstanding services in pioneering the mathematical training of navigators for the Russian fleet. Talented, versatile, level-headed, and greatly respected, Henry Farquharson devoted a solid forty years of his life to this innovative educational work. He died at St Petersburg on 19 December 1739 and was buried there, probably at St Sampson's cemetery, five days later. A measure of his indispensability is that attempts to find a British replacement between 1743 and 1745 proved abortive, and it was not until 1756 that Thomas Newberry (<i>fl</i>. 1748&#150;1778), an experienced teacher and lecturer, was appointed professor of mathematics and navigation to the renamed noble naval cadet corps in St Petersburg; he remained there until 1762.<br>
