<span class="headword">Stephenson,  James</span>  (1808&#150;1886), <span class="occ">engraver and lithographer</span>, was born at Manchester on 26 November 1808, the son of Thomas Stephenson, a boot and shoe maker. He was educated at a school kept by Thomas Rain, adjoining Oldham Street Chapel, and before the end of his schooldays was apprenticed to John Fothergill, an engraver, of Prince's Court, Market Street. While there he met the artist Henry Liverseege, and it was probably on the latter's advice that he went to London at the expiry of his apprenticeship and entered the studio of William Finden. There he gained the silver medal of the Society of Arts for an original design of a figure engraved in line. It was during this period that many of his book illustrations were undertaken, a number of them being landscapes for travel books such as Thomas Roscoe's <span class="italic">Tourist in Spain: Granada</span> (1835).<br>
<br>About 1838 Stephenson returned to Manchester and established himself as a historical and landscape engraver in Ridgefield, and afterwards in a studio in St Ann Street. He worked mostly as a metal-engraver and lithographer, but he also produced wood-engravings for <span class="italic">Clever Boys</span> and <span class="italic">Wide Wide World</span>, and made drawings in crayon. Besides furnishing illustrations for B. Love's <span class="italic">Manchester as it is</span> (1839), for Charles Swain's <span class="italic">The Mind and other Poems</span> (1841), and for other books, he engraved the members' card for the Anti-Corn Law League and executed for Agnew &amp; Sons large engravings of portraits of prominent members, among others Sir John Bowring, Edward Baines, and John Heyworth. He also engraved C. A. Duval's portrait of Richard Cobden, George Patten's portrait of John Frederick Foster, and John Boston's portrait of Daniel Grant, one of the original Brothers Cheeryble in Dickens's <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> (1839). In 1842, for the British Association, he executed a portrait of the chemist John Dalton (1766&#150;1844). These, together with large engravings for the print publishers, took up much of his mature working life.<br>
<br>About 1847 Stephenson moved to London, and from 1852 his plates were published in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1856. He engraved title-page vignettes after A. H. Gray for J. Timbs's <span class="italic">Curiosities of London</span> (1867), and these illustrate his mastery of the vignette form. Among his later engravings, some published by H. Graves, were <span class="italic">The Day of Wrath</span>, <span class="italic">The Last Judgment</span>, and <span class="italic">The Plains of Heaven</span>, after John Martin; <span class="italic">The Highland Whiskey Still</span>, <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, and <span class="italic">The Queen at Osborne</span>, after Landseer; <span class="italic">Ophelia</span>, after Millais; and <span class="italic">Portrait of Lord Tennyson</span>, after George Frederick Watts, published in the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> (1874). He also engraved pictures by Maclise, Gilbert Stuart Newton, Thomas Faed, and Sir John Watson Gordon. Many of his best-known works are after Scottish subjects, and he is represented in the City of Edinburgh collection by eight engravings. Stephenson died at his residence, 29 Dartmouth Park Road, London, on 28 May 1886. Among his contemporaries he was regarded as one of the finest line engravers in the country, and he was described by W. A. Chatto as &#145;a skilful engraver on steel&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Treatise on Wood Engraving</span>, 2nd edn, ed. H. G. Bohn, 1861, 600).<br>
