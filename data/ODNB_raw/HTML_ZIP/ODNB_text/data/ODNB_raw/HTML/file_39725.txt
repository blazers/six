<span class="headword">Strangways, Sir  John</span>  (1584&#150;1666), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the third, but eventually the eldest surviving, son of John Strangways (<i>d</i>. 1593) and Dorothy Thynne (<i>d</i>. 1592). He matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, in 1601 and was admitted to the Middle Temple on 4 January 1611, by which time he was already a knight. Before 1607 he married Grace Trenchard (1583&#150;1652). He became sheriff of Dorset in 1612&#150;13, and served as a justice of the peace. In 1623 he succeeded his elder brother in possession of the family estates at Chirk Castle and Melbury Sampford in Dorset. He represented Dorset in the Addled Parliament of 1614, and sat in all the parliaments of the 1620s, for Dorset (1621, 1624, 1628&#150;9) and in 1625 and 1626 for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis; by then he was established as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of John Digby, earl of Bristol.<br>
<br>Strangways emerged in these parliaments as one of the duke of Buckingham's strongest critics. He opposed the Spanish war and in 1626 supported the duke's impeachment. On 5 June 1626 he responded to Dudley Carleton's threat that the king might turn to &#145;new counsels&#146; by asserting that:<blockquote>all kings that are not tyrants or perjured, will keep themselves within the bounds of the laws of the[ir] own kingdoms, and those that counsel them to other ways are vipers fitting to be cast out, and pests of the commonwealth. (Bidwell and Jansson, 3.370)</blockquote>He refused to pay the forced loan and was temporarily imprisoned and removed from the commission of the peace as a result. He became increasingly concerned that royal policies threatened the rule of law, and reportedly declared on 1 May 1628 that &#145;what has been acted to the prejudice of the liberties of the subject of late, had it been in former ages, had been sufficient to have shaken the frame and foundation of the kingdom&#146;  (Keeler, <span class="italic">Long Parliament</span>; Bidwell, 3.197).<br>
<br>Strangways's relations with the crown remained touchy during Charles I's personal rule. In 1634 the king firmly rejected his request to keep Christmas in London and ordered him to return to Dorset. It is uncertain whether he paid ship money, but in 1637 he and three others were tried before Star Chamber for transporting a total of &pound;200,000 in gold out of England. He ignored the king's request for a contribution to the campaigns against the Scottish covenanters.<br>
<br>Strangways was returned for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis to both the Short and Long parliaments. In April 1640 he argued vigorously that redress of grievances should precede any grant of supply. He also objected to the Laudian altar policy, primarily on the characteristic grounds that he regarded it as contrary to law. However, once the Laudians had been removed, he strongly defended the existing institutions and liturgy of the Church of England. When, on 9 February 1641, the Commons debated the London root-and-branch petition, he insisted that &#145;if wee made a paritie in the church wee must at last come to a paritie in the Commonwealth. And that the Bishops weere one of the three estates of the kingdome and had voice in Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, ed. Notestein, 339&#150;40).<br>
<br>Like many other moderate royalists, Strangways's attachment to the established church and to the rule of law led him, during the summer and autumn of 1641, to regard Charles I as less of a hazard than his fiercest critics. In September Sir Edward Nicholas identified Strangways as one of the king's supporters in the Commons. By the end of the year the anti-episcopal demonstrators milling outside the Palace of Westminster listed him among &#145;persons disaffected to the kingdom&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.464), and on 29 November, trying to enter the Commons, he found himself &#145;encompassed with above 200 sworded and staved&#146; who demanded that he &#145;give his vote against Bishopps&#146;  (S. D'Ewes, <span class="italic">The Journal of Sir Simonds D'Ewes from the Final Recess of the Long Parliament to the Withdrawal of King Charles from London</span>, ed. W. H. Coates, 1942, 214).<br>
<br>On 19 May 1642 Strangways acted as teller against the houses' demand that the king be &#145;bound by his oath to pass such bills as shall be presented unto him by both Houses of Parliament for the good of the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2.580), but the proposed clause was carried by 103 votes to 61. On 9 July he acted as teller against a proposal to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers, and when this proposal was carried by 125 votes to 45 he promptly withdrew to his home in Dorset.<br>
<br>Strangways was among the first royalists to be disabled, on 6 September 1642. He sat in the Oxford Parliament which assembled in January 1644, and he was consistently one of the royalists specifically exempted from any pardon in successive parliamentarian propositions. On 28 July 1644 the committee for the advance of money imposed a fine of &pound;4000 on him. In October 1645 he was taken prisoner and eventually, in March 1648, he was allowed to compound for a fine of &pound;10,000, in return for which he and his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38019/', "Giles Strangways (1615&#150;1675)")</script> were pardoned for their delinquency and the sequestration was taken off their estates.<br>
<br>While imprisoned in the Tower, Strangways wrote a commonplace book and some verses that throw much light on his beliefs. As with many other royalists, the central elements of his outlook were a commitment to the established church, complete with non-Laudian episcopacy, and a belief in royal authority operating within the rule of law. He defended &#145;Church goverment&#146; as &#145;an hedge or wall about the doctrine of religion: a curbe to licentious courses&#146;, and he opposed &#145;the extirpation of prelacie out of the Church of England&#146;  (Beinecke Library, Yale University, Osborn MS b. 304, 35, 75). He insisted that:<blockquote>we of the Kings partie doe detest monopolyes and Shippe Monie and all the greivances of the people as much as any men living: we doe well know that our estates, lives and fames are preserved by the lawes; and that the King is bound by his lawes: we love p[ar]laments. (ibid., 47)</blockquote>Just as his commitment to the rule of law had led him to oppose royal policies of the later 1620s, so it now prompted him to deplore the way in which the parliamentarians flouted legal propriety in order to win the war.In May 1648, having paid &pound;5000 and secured the rest, Strangways's sequestration was discharged and he was released from the Tower. He returned at once to Melbury Sampford, where his property had suffered considerable damage during the years of civil war. In October 1649 he told Sir Simonds D'Ewes, a distant relative with whom he shared a love for antiquarianism, that &#145;the greatest part&#146; of his collection of &#145;old evidences&#146; had been &#145;either burnt or plundered&#146;  (S. D'Ewes, <span class="italic">The Autobiography and Correspondence of Sir Simonds D'Ewes, Bart.</span>, ed. J. O. Halliwell, 2 vols., 1845, 2.317). He apparently lived very quietly throughout the interregnum, and when Charles II visited Melbury Sampford during his flight after the battle of Worcester it fell to Strangways's son Giles to give him &pound;100 in gold and to apologize for his inability to provide the monarch with a boat. The family's political loyalties, although covert, remained firm.<br>
<br>Strangways's first wife died in 1652 and on 8 June 1653 he married Judith Edwards (<i>d</i>. in or after 1670). He apparently played no part in Penruddock's rising but he was nevertheless among the Dorset gentry imprisoned in Dorchester gaol following it. He appeared before Major-General Desborough in December 1655. He pleaded &#145;his integrity&#146;, but after the major-general &#145;dealt very plainly and indeed roundly&#146; with him he finally agreed to pay the decimation tax and was released  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 4.336&#150;7). Thereafter he apparently lived in retirement at Melbury Sampford until the Restoration.<br>
<br>On 14 May 1660 Strangways presided over the Restoration ceremonies at Sherborne, and in the celebrations which followed he &#145;rode along the streets, encourag[ing] and commend[ing] the people of Sherborne for their hearty and constant loyalty to the King&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Publicus</span>, no. 21, 17&#150;24 May 1660, 329, 331). The following month Strangways and his son Giles were among the signatories of a declaration of thanksgiving from the nobility and gentry of Dorset which was presented to the king at Whitehall. Subsequently he sat for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the Cavalier Parliament. Between May 1661 and May 1663 he was named to a total of thirty-two committees, but thereafter he seems to have played no active part in the parliament. He died on 30 December 1666 at Melbury Sampford, where he was buried.<br>
