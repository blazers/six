<span class="headword">Fawcett,  John</span>  (1740&#150;1817), <span class="occ">Particular Baptist minister and theological writer</span>, was born on 6 January 1740 at Lidget Green, near Bradford, the son of Stephen Fawcett (<i>c</i>.1702&#150;<i>c</i>.1751), who died of a fever in his fiftieth year, leaving a widow and a numerous family. Fawcett's &#145;pious mother&#146;  (<span class="italic">Account</span>, 8) encouraged him to attend Bradford parish church, where the lecturer was the headmaster of the grammar school, the Revd Butler, who instructed him in the classics. He also received help in his Latin studies from David Pratt, a Bradford Presbyterian minister. While serving his apprenticeship, he heard Whitefield preach in Bradford, considering him &#145;for natural, unaffected eloquence &hellip; superior to any person he ever heard&#146;  (ibid., 15). He subsequently associated with Methodists and Independents in Bradford before joining the Particular Baptists in 1758. In 1758 he married Susannah Skirrow (1735&#150;1810), the eldest daughter of John Skirrow of Bingley, and at the age of twenty &#145;was diligently practising compositions in prose and verse&#146;  (Turner, 65). Considering his secular occupations injurious to his health he entered on the work of a Baptist minister, and was settled at Wainsgate in 1764, and afterwards at Hebden Bridge, both in the parish of Halifax.<br>
<br>Fawcett, who was a gifted scholar, a devoted pastor, and an inspired preacher and hymn writer, declined an invitation to move to London in 1772, preferring to continue his ministry at Wainsgate, which he described as &#145;a dry and barren place&#146;  (Watson and Trickett, 272). His remuneration at Wainsgate never exceeded &pound;25 per annum. He opened a day school, founded a circulating library, and encouraged and trained many young men for the Baptist ministry, moving from his farmhouse near Wainsgate to Brearley Hall at Luddenden Foot in 1776 in order to develop this work.<br>
<br>Fawcett preached about 200 sermons each year, and such was his reputation as a preacher that a gallery had to be erected at Wainsgate to accommodate the large congregations, many of whom travelled long distances to hear him. In 1777 he established a second place of worship in the Calder valley at Hebden Bridge, where he continued his ministry for a further forty years. From time to time he published books on practical religion, which were well received, as well as a collection of hymns. The largest of his literary undertakings, and that by which he was best known, was a <span class="italic">Devotional Commentary on the Holy Scriptures</span>. This was finished in 1811 and was published in two large volumes, priced 5 guineas. Following its publication, he was awarded the degrees of MA in 1793 and DD in 1811 from an American college. His object was to bring out clearly and powerfully from every chapter of scripture such views as were best adapted to promote a devotional spirit, and each part of his exposition was followed by a paragraph of &#145;aspirations&#146;, intended to guide the feelings of readers. Fawcett, whose health had been declining in his later years, died from rheumatic fever on 25 July 1817 in his seventy-seventh year, at Ewood Hall, Midgley. He was buried at Wainsgate Particular Baptist Chapel.<br>
