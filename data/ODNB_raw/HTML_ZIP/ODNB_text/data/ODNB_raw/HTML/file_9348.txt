<span class="headword">Fermor,  William</span>, Baron Leominster  (1648&#150;1711), <span class="occ">art connoisseur</span>, was born on 3 August 1648 at Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9347/', "Sir William Fermor, first baronet (1621&#150;1661)")</script>, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1670), daughter of Hugh Perry, sometime sheriff of London, and widow of Henry Noel, second son of Edward, Viscount Campden. Fermor succeeded as second baronet in 1661, and was later educated at Magdalen College, Oxford (1664&#150;7). He served as MP for Northampton in the tory interest (1670&#150;79), and was elevated to the peerage on 12 April 1692, with the title Baron Leominster. Fermor was thrice married: first, on 21 February 1671, to Jane (<i>d</i>. 1673), daughter of Andrew Barker of Fairford, Gloucestershire, with whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth; second, in June 1682, to the Hon. Catherine Poulett (1664&#150;1687), with whom he had a daughter, Mary, who married Sir John Wodehouse, fourth baronet, of Kimberley, Norfolk; and third, on 5 March 1692 to Lady Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1746), daughter of Thomas Osborne, first duke of Leeds, and widow of Donogh O'Brien, Lord Ibrackan, grandson and heir of Henry, seventh earl of Thomond. She brought him &pound;10,000 and the duke got him the barony of Leominster within six weeks of the wedding. Sophia survived until 8 December 1746, and with her he had two sons, Thomas and William, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Fermor built the house and planned the gardens and plantations at Easton Neston. The house was completed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1702, on the recommendation of Sir Christopher Wren, a distant kinsman. He adorned the whole with part of the Arundel marbles which he had purchased in 1691 for &pound;300 and which his son restored with the assistance of Giovanni Battista Guelfi, &#145;a scholar of Camillo Rusconi&#146;  (Bridges, 1.289). The restoration was said to be &#145;misconceived&#146;, and Guelfi to have &#145;ruined the greater number of [the statues] he was permitted to touch&#146;  (Dallaway, 237). The collection was afterwards greatly neglected. &#145;Coming back&#146;, wrote Horace Walpole to George Montagu on 20 May 1736,<blockquote>we saw Easton Neston &hellip; where in an old greenhouse is a wonderful fine statue of Tully, haranguing a numerous assembly of decayed emperors, vestal virgins with new noses, Colossuses, Venuses, headless carcasses, and carcassless heads, pieces of tombs, and hieroglyphics. (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 9.5)</blockquote>The marbles were presented in 1755 to the University of Oxford by Henrietta Louisa, countess of Pomfret. A description of Easton Neston and its art treasures is included in the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Duke of Buckingham's Pictures</span> (1758) by George Vertue, and the house, gardens, and sculpture are illustrated in drawings by Peter Tillemans. Fermor died on 7 December 1711 at Easton Neston and was buried there on 15 December. He was succeeded by his elder son, Thomas.<br>
