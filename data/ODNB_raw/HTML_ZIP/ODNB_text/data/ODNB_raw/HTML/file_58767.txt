<span class="headword">Dalton,  John Neale</span>  (1839&#150;1931), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and royal tutor</span>, was born on the Isle of Thanet, Kent, on 24 September 1839, the eldest of five sons (among nine children) of John Neale Dalton (1808&#150;1880), a Church of England clergyman, and his wife (and first cousin), Eliza Maria (1807&#150;1895), daughter of William Allies. The herald <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7066/', "Lawrence Dalton")</script> was an ancestor. He went from Blackheath proprietary school to Clare College, Cambridge, as a scholar, afterwards taking a first in theology. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce ordained him in 1865, and his first curacy was in his father's parish of Milton Keynes. He was next a curate in Cambridge (1866&#150;9) and then at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight, where he impressed Queen Victoria during her residence at Osborne.<br>
<br>In 1871 Dalton was appointed tutor to Queen Victoria's grandsons Prince Albert Victor (Eddy), duke of Clarence and Avondale, and his younger brother Prince George, duke of York (afterwards George V). He proved more concerned with their moral character than with book learning. Dalton enforced a meticulously strict routine on the princes, and was obsessively concerned to stop errors or infractions. The princes were not, however, deeply or broadly educated. The narrowness of George V's outlook, and his excessive punctilio over formalities, may be attributable to Dalton's influence. As a royal tutor he became accomplished at artifice. By dissuading the queen from sending the older boy to public school, where he might be contaminated by vicious influences, Dalton ensured that he remained the princes' tutor while they were naval cadets on the <i>Britannia</i> at Dartmouth (1877&#150;9).<br>
<br>Dalton again proved his aptitude at intrigue by securing the decision&#151;despite opposition in the cabinet and from courtiers&#151;to send the princes (then aged fourteen and fifteen) on a world cruise lasting three years (1879&#150;82). The princes were thus removed from the influence of their family and the court and delivered wholly into the charge of Dalton, who accompanied them on HMS <i>Bacchante</i> as their chaplain and tutor. His account of this cruise published in 1886 covers 1518 pages; it is an ill-judged affair, by turns showy, pedantic, and self-glorifying. On the <i>Bacchante</i> Dalton was regarded as a martinet whose difficult temper disrupted the wardroom. He became jealous of the senior midshipman's intimacy with the princes, and having denounced &#145;his almost feminine ways&#146;, had him sent away  (Nicolson, 22). Although Prince Eddy became depressed during his long sojourn at sea, Prince George thrived. Dalton's <span class="italic">Sermons to Naval Cadets</span> was published in 1879.<br>
<br>At the end of the voyage Dalton was made CMG (1882) and governor to Eddy at Trinity College, Cambridge, until 1885. In 1884 he was nominated to a canonry at Windsor, which he held until his death. On 16 January 1886 he married Catherine Alicia (1863&#150;1944), daughter of Charles Evan-Thomas, Glamorgan landowner and colliery proprietor, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33031/', "Admiral Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas")</script>. They had a daughter and two sons, of whom the elder, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32697/', "(Edward) Hugh Neale Dalton")</script>, became a leading Labour politician and the younger died at birth. Canon Dalton had a romantic interest, doubtless sublimated, in young men. He reorganized the Windsor choir school in 1892, and liked to terrify or charm its choristers.<br>
<br>Dalton caused much unrest during his forty-seven years at Windsor. His love of the buildings and traditions of St George's Chapel was wholehearted; but as the chapel's steward, responsible for managing its finances and protecting its fabric, he made his colleagues miserable. In obtaining his objects he was adamant and unscrupulous. &#145;Thank heavens there are two things I have never had; nerves or a conscience&#146;, he once exclaimed  (Bolitho, 111). He was a bully and firebrand who shouted down colleagues who thwarted him. Perhaps, after his importance in the royal family and his years at sea, he was frustrated by the pettiness of cloister life; but certainly he seemed to revel in quarrels. The perversity of Dalton's behaviour was rooted in his social values. He was disrespectful of noblemen and contemptuous of his fellow clergy, but capable of geniality, patience, and humility with servants, poor or knavish youths, and pilfering or unlucky working men. When the poor of Windsor were unwell, he was an energetic and solicitous visitor. Finding the wife of a lodge keeper ill in bed, he got on his knees and scrubbed the kitchen floor for her.<br>
<br>Although the contents of Dalton's sermons were commonplace, no one could doze during them. The range of his voice from high falsetto to thunderous bass was remarkable. He loved the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and his readings of its more dramatic passages (&#145;My father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions&#146;, for example) were histrionic. He had severe but handsome features and stupendous physical vitality. He was a good Hebrew scholar (though detractors falsely claimed that he published a translation of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> without knowing a word of Hebrew), but curiously ignorant of English literature. On church architecture and antiquarian subjects he could speak authoritatively. His rollicking manners&#151;he was something of an expurgated Falstaff&#151;had an outlet at dinners of the Drapers' Company, of which he was master in 1919&#150;20.<br>
<br>Dalton accompanied Prince George, as prince of Wales, on his voyage to Australia (1901), and retained his pupil's devotion always; among other court appointments, he was domestic chaplain during George V's reign. He was created CVO in 1901 and promoted KCVO in 1911. Having read a lesson at evensong on 28 July 1931, he died of a stomach haemorrhage a few hours later that evening at his house in Windsor Castle cloisters. After cremation at Woking on 30 July, his ashes were interred in the south aisle of St George's Chapel on 31 July.<br>
