<span class="headword">Oldfield,  John</span>  (1789&#150;1863), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, only son of John Nicholls Oldfield, lieutenant in the Royal Marines, who served with distinction on the staff of the army and with the 63rd regiment in the Anglo-American War, and of Elizabeth, only daughter of Lieutenant Hammond RN, was born at Portsmouth on 29 May 1789. He was descended from Sir Anthony Oldfield, created a baronet in 1660, and he claimed to be the fifth baronet, but the proof was incomplete. A re-creation was deemed to be necessary, the cost of which Oldfield declined to incur, and the matter was dropped. His father retired from the service about the date of Oldfield's birth, and purchased a small estate at Westbourne, Sussex, dying in 1793.<br>
<br>In 1799 Oldfield's uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20682/', "Major Thomas Oldfield")</script>, Royal Marines, was killed at Acre. His distinguished conduct led to offers from Lord St Vincent, Lord Nelson, and Sir Sidney Smith to provide for John Oldfield in the navy, while Earl Spencer offered a commission in the Royal Marines, and the Marquess Cornwallis a nomination for the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. The latter was accepted. When Oldfield was old enough to go to Woolwich, he was only 4 feet 6 inches high, and a dispensing order had to be obtained from the master-general of the ordnance to allow his admission to the Royal Military Academy, the minimum standard being then 4 feet 9 inches. The junior cadets at that time went first to Great Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where he joined, on 23 August 1803, and was afterwards transferred to Woolwich. When George III inspected the cadets on 29 May 1805, Oldfield was one of the senior cadets. The king was struck with his diminutive stature, asked his name and age, and spoke warmly to the young man of his uncle's services at Acre.<br>
<br>Oldfield joined the trigonometrical survey at Bodmin in Cornwall in September 1805, and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 2 April 1806, stationed initially in Portsmouth. He was promoted lieutenant on 1 July. The following summer he was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and after two years' service in North America he returned to England, being stationed in September 1809 at Dorchester. He was promoted second captain on 1 May 1811.<br>
<br>From Dorchester, Oldfield went to Fort George in Scotland, and remained there until he embarked for the Netherlands in 1814. He landed at Hellevoetsluis on 28 March, and entered Antwerp with Sir Thomas Graham on 5 May. He was promoted captain on 26 January 1815. He was at Brussels on 7 April 1815, when news was received of Napoleon's escape from Elba, and at once he sent his family back to England. Oldfield was sent to Ypres to construct new defence works, and was entrusted with the inundation of the surrounding area, a difficult and unpopular operation. He shortly after joined the army of the duke of Wellington as brigade major of the Royal Engineers. He made a sketch plan of the field of Waterloo for the use of the duke, and took part in the battle of Waterloo and the subsequent occupation of Paris. In April 1819, in consequence of a reduction in the corps of Royal Engineers, he was placed on half pay, and passed his time chiefly at Westbourne.<br>
<br>In October 1823 Oldfield was sent on a special commission to the West Indies. He returned in 1824, and was quartered for some years in Ireland. On 23 July 1830 he was promoted brevet major. In September he was appointed commanding royal engineer (CRE) in Newfoundland. On 19 November 1831 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and in October 1835 returned to England to be appointed to the command of the Royal Engineers at Jersey. His services were belatedly recognized in 1836 when he was appointed KH. In March 1839 he was sent to Canada as CRE and colonel on the staff; he was there during the French Canadian uprising and rendered valuable service. On 9 November 1841 he was promoted colonel in the army and appointed aide-de-camp to the queen. He returned from Canada in the spring of 1843, and was appointed CRE in the western district. He was promoted regimental colonel on 9 November 1846 and was appointed to command the Royal Engineers in Ireland in 1848. On 20 June 1854 he was promoted major-general and went to live at Westbourne, becoming lieutenant-general on 10 May 1859. He was made a colonel-commandant of the corps of Royal Engineers on 25 October 1859, and was promoted general on 3 April 1862.<br>
<br>Oldfield was married three times. First, on 12 March 1810, at Dorchester, he married Mary, daughter of Christopher Arden of Dorchester, Dorset; they had seven children, and Mary died at Le Mans, France, on 6 July 1820. On 8 July 1822, at Cheltenham, he married Alicia, daughter of the Revd T. Hume, rector of Arden; they had eight children and Alicia died at Plymouth on 5 February 1840. On 12 March 1849, at Plymouth, he married Cordelia Anne, daughter of the Revd D. Yonge; she survived him. Oldfield died at his home, Oldfield Lawn, Westbourne, Sussex, on 2 August 1863, and was buried at Westbourne.<br>
<br>Oldfield's eldest son, John Rawdon, was a colonel in the Bengal Engineers; Anthony, a captain in the Royal Artillery, was killed at Sevastopol; Rudolphus, a captain, RN, and aide-de-camp to the queen, died on 6 February 1877; Richard became colonel-commandant, Royal Artillery (1900), and a general officer.<br>
