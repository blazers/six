<span class="headword">Burney, Sir  Cecil</span>, first baronet  (1858&#150;1929), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Jersey on 15 May 1858, the second son of Captain Charles Burney RN, for many years superintendent of Greenwich Hospital school, and his wife, Catherine Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Jones, of La Ferri&egrave;re, Jersey. He was educated at the Royal Naval Academy, Gosport, and entered the <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet in July 1871. He went to sea as a midshipman in October 1873, served for three years in the flagships of the Pacific and American stations, and was promoted sub-lieutenant in October 1877. The next three years were spent in educational courses and in short appointments in the troop ship <i>Serapis</i> and in the royal yacht, from which he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. He then joined the corvette <i>Carysfort</i>, one of the vessels of Lord Clanwilliam's detached squadron, which was afterwards merged into the Mediterranean Fleet during the Egyptian campaign of 1882. This gave Burney an opportunity of war service ashore, and he was in charge of a Gatling gun at the actions of Tell al-Mahuta and Qassasin in August 1882. In the same year he accompanied the mission led by Charles Warren across the desert in order to capture the Arabs who had seized and murdered Professor Edward Henry Palmer, Captain William John Gill, and Lieutenant Harold Charrington; he also took part in the operations against Osman Digna near Suakin in 1884.<br>
<br>Burney next spent two years in the gunnery schools at Portsmouth and Devonport. Then followed over five and a half years' service as gunnery lieutenant in the North American, reserve, and channel squadrons. On promotion to commander in January 1893 he was appointed to the <i>Hawke</i> and served in the Mediterranean for three years; and in 1896 he went to Portland in command of the boys' training establishment in the <i>Boscawen</i> and <i>Minotaur</i> for three and a half years until September 1899. He was promoted captain in January 1898. After commanding the <i>Hawke</i> in the naval manoeuvres of 1900, he commissioned the <i>Sappho</i> for service on the south-east coast of America, but was soon transferred to the Cape station during the South African War. His ship struck the Durban bar when in the charge of a pilot on 3 May 1901, and Burney had to bring her home. In May 1902 he became flag-captain to Rear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes in the Home Fleet, and remained with him and his successor, Rear-Admiral Po&euml;, until June 1904. He then spent a year (1904&#150;5) in command of the ex-Chilean battleship <i>Triumph</i> in the Channel Fleet. His successful work in training boys at Portland led to his appointment in July 1905 to the <i>Impregnable</i> as inspecting captain of all boys' training ships, a post that he held until his promotion to flag rank in 1909. He thus spent, in all, six years in supervising the training of boys.<br>
<br>Burney's first appointment to flag rank was in the Plymouth division of the Home Fleet for one year. From February 1911, when he took command of the 5th cruiser squadron, he was continuously on full pay for nine years. At the end of 1911 he took command of the Atlantic Fleet, with the acting rank of vice-admiral; he transferred to the 3rd battle squadron in 1912, shortly before reaching confirmed vice-admiral's rank. This squadron was on special service in the Mediterranean, and the disturbances that arose in Montenegro and Albania at the close of the second Balkan war led to the dispatch, arranged by the British foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey, of an international naval force to Antivari on the Montenegrin coast in April 1913. Burney's squadron was sent in order to secure that an Englishman should be senior officer of the combined fleet. Burney took command and handled the highly delicate and difficult situation, in which his firm manner and rugged mien stood him in good stead, with great ability, and he received a special commendation both from the Foreign Office and from the Admiralty. He had to secure unanimity of action between the naval forces of the five powers represented, as well as resolve the differences between the turbulent Balkan states ashore. He established a pacific blockade of the coast during April and May of 1913, and then from May to November commanded the international force occupying Scutari, which the Montenegrins had captured, until the trouble was finally settled by the conclusion of peace. He was created KCB in the summer of 1913, and on the termination of the Scutari affair he was gazetted KCMG.<br>
<br>On his return to England at the end of 1913 Burney took over the command of the Second and Third fleets, then in partial reserve, and the early part of 1914 was occupied in preparing for the test mobilization of that summer. On the outbreak of the First World War in August these fleets were organized as the Channel Fleet, with the duty of protecting the channel from enemy raids. In December 1914 Burney went to the 1st battle squadron of the Grand Fleet, as second in command under Lord Jellicoe. At the battle of Jutland (31 May 1916) his squadron was the rear of the line, and was more heavily engaged than the rest of the battleships of the main fleet. His flagship, the <i>Marlborough</i>, was torpedoed, and during the night he transferred his flag to the <i>Revenge</i>. He was promoted admiral a few days after the battle of Jutland, and was made GCMG for his services in the action. Jellicoe had complete confidence in Burney, but that confidence was not shared by many other flag-officers, who were apprehensive that Burney might succeed to command of the Grand Fleet. He was regarded as overcautious, lacking in initiative, and burdened by ill health.<br>
<br>In November 1916, when Jellicoe was appointed first sea lord, Burney joined the Board of Admiralty as second sea lord. However, the prime minister, Lloyd George, and Sir Eric Geddes, who became first lord in July 1917, grew anxious to replace him by a younger, and in their opinion more efficient, man. Consequently, and despite Jellicoe's effort to keep him, when the board was reorganized the following September, Burney was relieved. Shortly afterwards he was appointed commander-in-chief, coast of Scotland at Rosyth; there he remained until appointed in March 1919 to be commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. A year later, owing to prolonged ill health, he was relieved of the command at his own request. He was promoted admiral of the fleet in the following November, created a baronet for his war services in January 1921, and promoted to GCB in 1922. He died at his home, Upham House, Upham, Hampshire, on 5 June 1929. He was buried at Brookwood cemetery five days later.<br>
<br>Burney married in 1884 Lucinda Marion (<i>d</i>. 1944), second daughter of George Richards Burnett, of London; they had one son and two daughters. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32191/', "Commander Charles Dennistoun Burney RN (1888&#150;1968)")</script>, who succeeded to the baronetcy, invented during the First World War the paravane, a device for protecting ships against mines, and subsequently was a major supporter of projects for the commercial development of airships. His daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76744/', "Sybil Katherine Neville-Rolfe (1885&#150;1955)")</script> was founder of the Eugenics Society.<br>
<br>Burney was a fine seaman of the old school, with a deep sense of loyalty to his chiefs. In handling ships and fleets he had the natural ease and confidence of a born sailor. A man of powerful physique, in his early days he excelled in boxing and feats of strength. Although of somewhat austere demeanour, his patent sincerity won him the complete confidence and affection of many who served under him throughout his long sea service. There were others, particularly his fellow flag-officers, who tended to regard him as lacking in the qualities of personality and initiative necessary for the highest command, and as a trusted second in command to Jellicoe Burney probably reached the peak of his potential.<br>
