<span class="headword">Hastings family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1759&#150;1907), <span class="occ">farmers</span>, were tenant farmers from 1759 to 1907 on the Holkham estate belonging to the Coke family of Norfolk, who were created earls of Leicester in 1837. Their farming activities were representative of the progressive tenants of the large Norfolk farms which made the estate famous for its part in promoting agricultural improvements.<br>
<br>The first member of the family to lease land on the estate was Thomas Hastings (1729&#150;1804), who took over Hall Farm, Longham, in 1759. In 1776 he was paying &pound;225 per annum in rent for &#145;Hall Farm, Brakelands and sheep walk&#146;. This entry in the Holkham audit book suggests that at this date part of the farm was still open heath and intermittently ploughed breck.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_60132"></a><span class="headword">John Sutton Hastings</span>  (1790&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span>, another member of the family, who was born at Longham on 4 December 1790, held the farm from 1816. An enclosure act for Longham parish had been passed in 1813, when the common was enclosed and the fields rearranged to form a compact farm of the large rectangular fields so typical of the Holkham estate. Although these improvements were initiated by the landlord, much of the work was done by the tenants, who were responsible for claying newly enclosed land, planting new hedges, and grubbing up and levelling old hedgerow banks.<br>
<br>A detailed investigation of the estate in 1816 included a brief vignette about Hall Farm. &#145;Much money has been expended upon the improvement of the farm with a <i>very</i> far distant prospect of a return&#146;, it reported; &#145;A very large sum is still required to complete the present improvements.&#146; The rent of this 580 acre farm was &pound;600, which the agent considered &#145;high&#146;. Mr Hastings was described as &#145;a zealous and industrious tenant heart-broken by his present undertaking&#146;. However, a note was added to this description by the agent, Francis Blaikie, saying, &#145;Mr Coke has promised to take him by the hand&#146;  (Blaikie, report, 1816, Holkham Hall). This probably involved financial assistance and in 1822 the rent was reduced to &pound;400.<br>
<br>After the recession of the early 1820s, agricultural fortunes improved and John Sutton Hastings was at the forefront of progress. By 1845 he was a member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England and in 1843 he responded to a farming questionnaire circulated by R. N. Bacon of the <span class="italic">Norwich Mercury</span> in order to obtain information for his book on the agriculture of Norfolk. By this time the farm was farmed on a four-course rotation (although Hastings believed that there were some circumstances in which two grain crops could be grown in succession). Hastings fed half his turnips to the sheep in the field, but he also bought oil cake and malt dust as feed. He drilled his seeds rather than sowing or dibbling them by hand, and he altered the standard implements to suit his purposes. He did try new methods, &#145;but generally went back to the old&#146;  (Norfolk RO, Bacon MS). His belief in the scientific basis of the high-input, high-output system of &#145;high farming&#146; was illustrated by his optimistic closing comment, so different from the sentiments expressed in 1816, that &#145;production will increase as knowledge itself increases&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Hastings was married, first, to Barbara Anne (1786/7&#150;1847), with whom, between about 1816 and 1823, he had three daughters and a son. In 1851 his nephew, John Henry Hastings, who was farm manager, and his unmarried daughter Charlotte were living with him at Longham. He married, on 23 September 1852, his second wife, the botanical artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74794/', "Sarah Ann Drake (1803&#150;1857)")</script>; after her death he married, in October 1858, her friend Anne Lindley (<i>b</i>. 1800/01), sister of the botanist John Lindley. During this period the farm continued to be well farmed and stocked. Large numbers of animals were kept and in 1864 the possibility of using modern fertilizers meant that John Sutton Hastings was given permission to depart from the terms of his lease and grow two crops of corn in succession  (Holkham Hall, letter books).<br>
<br>Active in the community, John Sutton Hastings was instrumental in organizing the building of Longham School in 1859 and the restoration of the church in 1867, with much of the finance being provided by the Holkham estate. Hastings himself built &#145;a double cottage for two married couples or four widows not under the age of 60 years&#146;  (White, 403). His interest in parish affairs was recorded on his monument in Longham church, which stated that &#145;during more than half a century he was a steady friend and benefactor of this parish&#146;. He died at Longham on 9 July 1869. <a name="cosubject_60133"></a><span class="headword">John Hastings</span>  (1820/21&#150;1884)<span class="occ"></span>, his son, baptized at Longham on 4 February 1821, took over the farm on his father's death. In 1851 he had Woodhouse farm, in the neighbouring parish of Gressenhall, and married, at East Dereham on 9 January 1851, Mary Alice (1826&#150;1891), daughter of William Hunt. They had at least four daughters and four sons. Hastings died at Hall Farm, Longham, on 31 December 1884, and was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>The general decline in farming fortunes as cereal prices collapsed during the 1870s meant that, in spite of the large number of cattle kept on the farm, profits fell and the rent was unpaid in 1883. The previous year the estate had been informed that the family intended to quit. Following the death of his father, <a name="cosubject_60134"></a><span class="headword">John Hastings</span>  (1853&#150;1907)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Gressenhall on 17 December 1853, took over the farm, but was never able to make the levels of profit typical of the middle of the century. Rents were reduced from a peak of &pound;1013 in the 1870s to &pound;700 in 1885, &pound;600 in 1887, and &pound;477 in 1895. On four separate occasions between 1882 and 1895 John Hastings handed in notice that he intended to quit. In 1892 he married Helen (<i>b</i>. 1859), daughter of Edward Kendrick, farmer, of Weeford, Staffordshire, with whom he had at least two sons and one daughter. The family finally left the farm after he died at Longham on 10 May 1907. By this time the farm was running relatively smoothly as John had developed a business breeding horses for hackney carriages, which was more likely to remain profitable than conventional farming.<br>
<br>This mid-Norfolk family, renting the same farm from a famous estate for more than 150 years, illustrates the reaction of intelligent farmers of capital to the changes in agricultural practice and fortunes over the periods of the &#145;agricultural revolution&#146;, &#145;high farming&#146;, and the &#145;great depression&#146;.<br>
