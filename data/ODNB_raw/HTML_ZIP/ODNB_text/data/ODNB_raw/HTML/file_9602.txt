<span class="headword">Fitzherbert, Sir  Anthony</span>  (<em>c.</em>1470&#150;1538), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was the youngest son of Ralph Fitzherbert (<i>d</i>. 1484) of Norbury, Derbyshire, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1490), daughter of John Marshall of Upton, Leicestershire, and Sedsall, Derbyshire. The Fitzherberts had been seated at Norbury since the twelfth century and were very numerous: Ralph had twelve surviving children, his father Nicholas seventeen. Since his father had been unable to provide for him, Anthony's mother left him &pound;10 a year in 1490 &#145;towards his exhibition att court appon condition that he contynue his lernyng at the same&#146;  (Boersma, &#145;Sir Antony Fitzherbert&#146;, 13). This condition he fulfilled by joining Gray's Inn and becoming one of its most learned alumni. An early sign of professional engagement occurs in 1494, when he acted as a feoffee; in 1505 he is mentioned as an arbitrator in Staffordshire; and in 1507 he is noticed three times as counsel in the court of requests.<br>
<br>About 1508 Fitzherbert became a bencher of his inn, choosing to read on the &#145;beaupleader&#146; chapter of the <span class="roman">Statute of Marlborough</span>. The lectures, which survive, were an exposition of the law relating to pleading, beginning with counts and ending with dilatory pleas, and a promise that if he read again he would tackle special pleading. The following year he became a justice of the peace in Leicestershire and Warwickshire and recorder of Coventry. Only two years or so from his reading, while still comparatively junior in the profession, he was called to the degree of serjeant and created in November 1510. As the junior serjeant from Gray's Inn he gave the serjeant's reading, taking the same text again and apparently covering the same ground, doubtless for want of long enough notice to fulfil the promise made in his first reading. The pressure of work as a serjeant, and perhaps also a shift in his principal residence, forced him in 1512 to resign his recordership of Coventry. His appointment as one of the king's serjeants came on 24 November 1516, and on 20 May 1522 he was elevated to the bench as a justice of the common pleas, with a knighthood the same year.<br>
<br>The latest year-books, and the reports of Dyer and Spelman, show that Fitzherbert's judicial opinions were held in high regard by his contemporaries, though he took a strict view of precedent and did not always agree with more purposive interpretations of the law. In 1535 he famously denied the authority of an innovative king's bench decision of 1520 that an action on the case would lie against executors to recover the simple debts of their testator&#151;a decision won by his own advocacy when a serjeant&#151;with the outburst, &#145;Put that case out of your books, for it is not law without doubt&#146;  (Baker and Milsom, 448). He also held that actions on the case could not be used for spiritual defamation, such as an accusation of heresy, and he is known to have rejected several other recent developments which departed from older precedents. Besides routine commissions and work as an assize judge on the northern and midland circuits, Fitzherbert was employed as the legal member of a special commission to restore order to Ireland after the earl of Kildare's quarrel with Sir Piers Butler in 1524, and sat on most of the celebrated state trials of the 1530s. He was involved in the proceedings leading to Cardinal Wolsey's fall in 1529, sat as a commissioner in chancery on his resignation, and signed the articles against him. His conservatism doubtless extended to the spiritual as well as the legal sphere. At any rate, he had qualms about the dissolution of the monasteries and on his deathbed is said to have commanded his children not to acquire any monastic land. Several of his immediate descendants, moreover, including his son Thomas and his grandsons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9605/', "Thomas Fitzherbert")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9604/', "Nicholas Fitzherbert")</script>, suffered for their adherence to the papal cause. Fitzherbert's want of enthusiasm for government policy in the 1530s could account for his lack of further promotion. Despite his pre-eminence in the law, he remained a puisne judge until his death.<br>
<br>Fitzherbert is one of the best-known English legal writers of the sixteenth century. His major work, the <span class="italic">Magnum abbreviamentum</span> (printed in three parts between 1514 and 1517), entitled in later editions <span class="italic">La graunde abridgement</span>, was an enormous enterprise for its day, a massive digest of 13,845 cases from the year-books arranged under alphabetical headings. Its publication is thought to have consumed 250,000 large sheets of paper, and it was so far superior to Statham that the latter was never reprinted. Its preparation must have occupied Fitzherbert for many years, and he is known to have been helped in the task by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21036/', "William Owen")</script>. The work probably began in the time of Henry VII, and the entries include thirty-nine brief original reports of cases between 1499 and 1504 taken by Fitzherbert himself as a barrister of Gray's Inn, including an important dictum of Sir John Fyneux in 1499 on the law of contract. Also included were extracts from several unprinted year-books, such as those from the reign of Richard II that were later extracted by Richard Bellewe and printed separately as <span class="italic">Les ans du Roy Richard le Second</span> (1585). Although Fitzherbert's headings were chosen conservatively, and there was little in the way of comment, subdivision, or cross-reference, the new resource had a profound effect on legal research and writing. William Staunford, for instance, recommended that its contents be &#145;ordered and disposed in such sort that all the judiciall actes and cases in the same might be brought and appeare under certaine principles, rules and groundes&#146;  (Staunford, preface): advice that he followed himself in preparing his <span class="italic">Plees del coron</span> (1557) and <span class="italic">Exposition of the Kings Prerogative</span> (1567), and which was also taken up in Simon Thelwall's <span class="italic">Digest des briefes originals</span> (1579). The abridgement was reprinted in 1565 and again (in smaller format) in 1577. It was to some extent overtaken by Sir Robert Brooke's <span class="italic">Graunde Abridgement</span> (1573), which contained fewer entries but more recent material and useful marginal headings.<br>
<br>A smaller but more original work was Fitzherbert's <span class="italic">La novel natura brevium</span> which was published towards the end of his life in 1534. It was inspired by the so-called &#145;old <span class="italic">Natura brevium</span>&#146; (the name given to two or more different medieval treatises, or lecture courses, on writs) but was a new treatment and much more detailed, with references both to recent cases and to the abridgement. It remained the principal reference work on writs until the abolition of the forms of action in the nineteenth century. The original French text (with the forms of writs in Latin) was reprinted eleven times, the last edition appearing in 1635. A rather poor English translation by William Hughes was printed in 1652 and four times reprinted, the last version (1730) with notes attributed to Sir Matthew Hale. A new translation by George Wilson, serjeant-at-law, was published in 1755 and reprinted in 1794.<br>
<br>A third book, which appeared in the year of Fitzherbert's death, was <span class="italic">The New Boke of Justices of the Peas</span> (1538), which appeared in both law French and English editions bearing the same date but differing slightly in content and arrangement. The adjective &#145;new&#146; again paid due respect to an earlier work, this time the anonymous late medieval <span class="italic">Boke of Justices of Peas</span> which was printed about 1506, but Fitzherbert's treatment was characteristically more thorough and detailed. These two &#145;books of justices&#146; are hailed as the first printed treatises on English criminal law, and Fitzherbert's remained in use until it was overtaken by Dalton and Coke in the seventeenth century. There were eight reprints between 1540 and 1566, and an enlarged edition by Richard Crompton in law French (1583) which was itself reprinted five times. The latest edition of &#145;Crompton's <span class="italic">Justice</span>&#146; was in 1617. A tract entitled <span class="italic">Offyce des Vyscountes, Bailiffes</span> first appeared as an appendix to the French version of the <span class="italic">Boke</span> and was sometimes printed separately. It is not certain that it was composed by the same hand.<br>
<br>Several other works were formerly but mistakenly attributed to Sir Anthony. <span class="italic">The Boke of Husbandrie</span> and <span class="italic">The Boke of Surveyinge</span>, both printed in 1523, were by one Master Fitzherbarde, but this is now known to have been the judge's brother John. There is no evidence for attributing the anonymous <span class="italic">Diversite de courtz</span> to Sir Anthony other than an unreliable later note in a copy in the British Library. Some sources mention a printed reading on the <span class="italic">Extenta manerii</span>, but this is a ghost.<br>
<br>Although he was the youngest of a large family, Fitzherbert established himself as a substantial property owner in Derbyshire and Staffordshire. In 1507 he married Dorothy, second daughter of Sir Henry Willoughby of Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, but the marriage ended within months when Dorothy died on 5 November. His second wife was Maud, daughter and heir of Richard Cotton, who brought him a substantial inheritance including the great house at Hamstall Ridware, Staffordshire. The marriage probably took place about 1511, when Fitzherbert was added to the Staffordshire commission of the peace. Norbury and the other family estates were entailed on Anthony under the will of his eldest brother, John, dated 1517, and Anthony moved into Norbury Hall under an <i>inter vivos</i> arrangement in 1526. The settlement, intended to disinherit John's daughters, led to an allegedly riotous altercation at John's funeral in 1531 and a subsequent Star Chamber suit.<br>
<br>Sir Anthony Fitzherbert died on 26 or 27 May 1538. He was buried at Norbury, where there is a brass figure in judicial robes, parts of which (including the head) were detached in 1842 and lost. The judge's eldest surviving son, Sir Thomas, served in parliament in 1545 but refused to accept the Elizabethan religious settlement and died in the Tower in 1591. His fourth son, William, became a bencher of the Inner Temple and member of parliament for Lichfield in 1553 but died in 1558 or 1559, leaving among other children <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9605/', "Thomas Fitzherbert")</script>, Jesuit.<br>
