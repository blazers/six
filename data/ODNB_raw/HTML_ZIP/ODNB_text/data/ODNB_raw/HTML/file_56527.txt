<span class="headword">Barrasford,  Thomas</span>  (1859&#150;1910), <span class="occ">variety theatre entrepreneur</span>, was born at East Jarrow, Westoe, co. Durham, on 2 November 1859, the son of Henry Barrasford, ballast keelman, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sheraton. His father became a publican, and Thomas followed him into the licensed trade, taking a number of public houses in Jarrow in the 1880s and 1890s. He was also involved in boxing promotions and, for a period in the 1890s, he managed the black boxer Frank Craig, the so-called &#145;coffee house cooler&#146;  (Fairfax-Blakeborough, 161). His music-hall career began in the same decade when he purchased a circus building in Jarrow and re-opened it as the Jarrow Palace of Varieties. In 1899 he acquired the Leeds Tivoli and followed this with the rapid acquisition and refurbishment of a number of halls in the English provinces and Scotland, building up a syndicate of fourteen halls by the early 1900s. Barrasford formed his various interests into a limited company in 1903.<br>
<br>Barrasford placed particular emphasis on the interior design and furnishing of his properties which were among the most luxurious of all British variety theatres. The Liverpool Hippodrome, which he opened in 1902, was, indeed, regarded by many as Britain's best equipped variety theatre and was probably the first to offer tip-up plush seats at what contemporaries termed popular prices. Barrasford was also among the first to introduce the cinematograph into the variety theatre, eventually using his own projection device, the &#145;Barrascope&#146;, which he developed with photographer Owen Brooks and engineer Fred Borland in 1902.<br>
<br>The early twentieth-century variety industry was characterized by managements' use of so-called &#145;barring clauses&#146;, which prevented performers from taking engagements at theatres in close proximity to venues where they were already contracted for future appearances. Barrasford was especially assiduous in his recruitment of continental performers who were not usually bound by such restrictions and many leading European variety acts were introduced to Britain as a result. This also led to his developing considerable foreign interests and he eventually controlled variety theatres in Paris, Brussels, Barcelona, and Marseilles.<br>
<br>By 1904 Barrasford looked set to become Britain's leading variety entrepreneur, but he overstretched his resources in the course of intense competition with a rival syndicate headed by Oswald Stoll. There was some personal animosity between the two men, probably related to contractual disputes, and this translated into a battle over which company could be the first to open a major West End variety theatre. In fact, Stoll's Coliseum opened two days ahead of Barrasford's Lyceum, in December 1905. Barrasford was unable to gain a drink licence from the London county council and this proved a barrier to profitability. Barrasford was forced to sell the Lyceum in 1906 and he moved the headquarters of his now rather less ambitious company to the Brighton Hippodrome. He contracted Bright's disease about 1907 and in 1909 control of his variety chain passed to the London-based syndicate operated by Walter Gibbons.<br>
<br>Barrasford was married twice, his second wife being the music-hall singer Maud D'Almayne, who appears to have shared in some of his business enterprises in his final years. He had five children by the two marriages.<br>
<br>During his lifetime Barrasford developed a strong interest in horse-racing. He was a heavy gambler and he owned a small string of racehorses which were trained at Malton in the North Riding of Yorkshire. His most significant contribution to the race world was his development of a starting gate, once again the result of collaboration with the Leeds engineer Fred Borland. A device first used at Newmarket in 1897, the starting gate was prone to create movements and shadows which caused panic among the horses and Barrasford's model, which had an underground mechanism, was deemed far superior in this respect to most other early versions. It was used extensively in the north of England and on training grounds in Britain and the continent in the early years of the century. Barrasford died on 1 February 1910 from diabetes and pleurisy at The Hippodrome, 50 Smiddle Street, Brighton, and was buried in Brighton. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
