<span class="headword">Park <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Reynolds]</span>,  Maria Hester</span>  (1760&#150;1813), <span class="occ">composer and keyboard player</span>, was born on 29 September 1760. She was almost certainly the Miss Reynolds who on 5 November 1772 sang and played a harpsichord concerto in a concert at the Oxford Music Room. She was a vocal and harpsichord soloist at concerts there in 1773, and then appeared regularly as a harpsichordist. For her benefit concert on 11 February 1779 tickets were available from Miss Reynolds in Holywell, Oxford. In spring 1783 she was one of the principal instrumental soloists for the series of Wednesday concerts at the Hanover Square Rooms, London. Jane Guest was the other harpsichordist for these concerts, and &#145;Miss Reynolds, Oxford&#146; subscribed to Miss Guest's <span class="italic">Six Sonatas</span>, for which subscriptions closed in April 1783. At the benefit concert of the oboist John Parke at the Tottenham Street Rooms she joined his daughter, the ten-year-old Maria Frances Parke (with whom she has often been confused), in a Clementi piano duet, and &#145;displayed great ability on the instrument&#146;  (<span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, 1 May 1783). In March 1784 she organized her own London benefit at Willis's Rooms, when tickets were to be had of Miss Reynolds at 102 Pall Mall.<br>
<br>Maria Hester Reynolds's first publication, a set of six <span class="italic">Sonatas for the Harpsichord or Piano forte</span> (1785), was dedicated to the countess of Uxbridge, with the word &#145;Gratitude&#146; prominent on the illustrated title-page. The impressively long list of subscribers included a large Oxford contingent. She became a sought-after music teacher of the aristocracy, and later dedicatees were to include the duchess of Ancaster, the duchess of Devonshire, Lady Charlotte Greville, Lady Mary Bentinck, and Lady Harriet Montagu. At times she stayed with her pupils at their country houses, for Anna Seward later remembered Miss Reynolds as &#145;resident near Lichfield, in the unintellectual house of pride&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Anna Seward</span>, 4.187). She published her op. 2, <span class="italic">Three Sonatas for Harpsichord or Piano forte</span>, before her marriage on 21 April 1787 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21280/', "Thomas Park (1758/9&#150;1834)")</script>, engraver and future man of letters. &#145;Mr Park, engraver and wife&#146; visited Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill that September  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 229). Her compositions from op. 3, <span class="italic">A Set of Glees with the Dirge in &#145;Cymbeline&#146;</span>, appeared under the name Maria Hester Park or M. H. Park. She was a very capable, professional composer, whose published works reached op. 13. Keyboard sonatas predominate, several with a violin accompaniment; they are varied and show rhythmic vitality. Her most striking work is her op. 6, the concerto for piano or harpsichord and string orchestra.<br>
<br>During his visits to England, Joseph Haydn became acquainted with Maria Hester, and a letter of October 1794 survives in which he thanked Thomas Park for &#145;the two so charming Prints&#146; and continued &#145;I tack me the liberty to Send for the Mistris Park a little Sonat, and to come to Her next Friday or Saturday&#146;  (Landon, <span class="italic">Haydn in England</span>, 275). Three prints engraved by Thomas Park were in Haydn's possession at the time of his death. The Parks' fifth daughter was born in August 1796, and there was also a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21276/', "John James Park (1793&#150;1833)")</script>. Maria Hester continued to teach and so was able &#145;to contribute very materially to the comfort of that happy and united home&#146;  (Jenkins, 11). Thomas Park was a devoted husband, and his wife figures in many of his published poems:<blockquote>
<div>By skill and science highly was she grac'd<br>
</div>
<div>In Music's melting art, and with such taste<br>
</div>
<div>And touch of feeling did she sounds convey,<br>
</div>
<div>Her heart appear'd more than her hands to play.<br>
</div> (Park, <span class="italic">Morning Thoughts</span>, 112)</blockquote>She continued teaching in London until at least 1807, but suffered increasingly from rheumatism. Various cures were tried, but the mineral water and salubrious air of Hampstead proved most helpful, and the Parks spent the summers there from 1801. A house in Church Row, Hampstead, became their home, and Maria Hester died there, aged fifty-two, on 7 June 1813. She was buried at St Mary's, Acton, on 12 June.<br>
