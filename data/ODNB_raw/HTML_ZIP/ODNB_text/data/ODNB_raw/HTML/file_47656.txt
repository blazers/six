<span class="headword">&Ouml;sterberg,  Martina Sofia Helena  Bergman</span>  (1849&#150;1915), <span class="occ">feminist and promoter of women's physical education</span>, was born on 7 October 1849 in Hammarlunda, a village near Malm&ouml; in the south of Sweden, one of the six children of Karl Bergman, a prosperous farmer, and his wife, Betty Lundgen. Even as a girl, it seems, she felt impatient of the restrictions imposed on women, and her family encouraged her independence. She was privately educated, and worked as a governess and as a librarian before enrolling in 1879 at the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute, founded in Stockholm in 1814 by the much-venerated pioneer of remedial gymnastics, Per Hendrick Ling. In an era when formal exercise was very largely military drill, Ling had explored its therapeutic potential. When he died, his exercise system&#151;with its strong physiological base&#151;remained the core of the institute's training of both men and women gymnastic teachers. Women needed health as well as men, Ling had stated, and Martina Bergman was to make it a tool of their emancipation.<br>
<br>Ling's system was virtually unknown in Britain before 1879, when the London school board set out to improve the poor physique of girls in its elementary schools by engaging a Swedish woman to introduce Ling's free exercises. As they required no apparatus, these could be performed in the classroom, if the teacher had a rudimentary training. The massive task of training teachers began, and was continued with great success by Martina Bergman when she took over the school board post in 1881. She also succeeded strikingly in her aim of publicizing the Swedish system by open practices and demonstrations (including one before royalty).<br>
<br>Called to give evidence in 1887 to the Cross commission on elementary schooling, Madame Bergman &Ouml;sterberg (as she was known from her marriage in 1886 to Edvin Per Wilhelm &Ouml;sterberg, a Stockholm schoolmaster) said that where Ling's system had been introduced children held themselves better and were more alert. Privately, though, she had already decided that her ideal of a healthy womanhood could not be realized among the poor. Their physique, she told a friend, was so impaired by neglect, bad food, and bad living conditions that, unless these circumstances could be changed, no radical improvement could be effected. In 1885 she had launched her own college, the Hampstead Physical Training College, to prepare students from more privileged classes to teach in the new girls' secondary schools. In 1887 she left school board work, and in 1895 moved away from London to Dartford Heath in Kent, where she bought a property, Kingsfield, Oakfield Lane, with room for facilities such as playing fields and tennis courts for a physical training college. Students of the Bergman &Ouml;sterberg college took a rigorous &#145;Swedish&#146; course of gymnastics, anatomy, and physiology, as well as English team games&#151;an addition prompted by the fact that hockey, lacrosse, and cricket were growing popular with English schoolgirls.<br>
<br>Such a college was intensely novel. Visitors were dazzled by student displays, but also by the crusading zeal of the handsome, well-built, imperious woman who accounted for its success by saying that Ling's system was too good to fail. Madame Bergman &Ouml;sterberg herself took care to see that it did not; not only, as she later said, training the teachers but creating a demand for them. Amid the apprehensions of national decline which prevailed around the turn of the century, she convinced the heads of countless high schools for girls that the gymnastics and games mistress&#151;the specialist in health&#151;had become essential. By 1905 five other colleges like hers existed to meet the demand, two of them having been launched by her own former students. In 1909 the Board of Education based its physical education syllabus for elementary schools on the work of Ling. His system was introduced in the navy and in some boys' public schools, and remained standard in girls' schools throughout Britain and the colonies.<br>
<br>Madame Bergman &Ouml;sterberg died of cancer at her home, Kingsfield, in Dartford Heath, Kent, on 30 July 1915, struggling at the last to complete the formalities of leaving her college in trust to the nation. Sir George Newman, who had known her since his days as first medical director at the Board of Education, was to describe her, looking back, as &#145;the morning star&#146; of that reformation in health which he had tried to promote by such means as school medical inspections. It must be said, though, that in later life she had been wrapped up in her college and at some remove from the kind of problems she encountered in her school board days.<br>
<br>Madame Bergman &Ouml;sterberg's feminism, too, had its narrow streak. She did, indeed, endow a scheme in Sweden to educate women for enfranchisement, and she and her husband in 1914 donated their house in Bostad, south Sweden, to be made into a women's horticultural college. But in England, as the suffrage battle raged in the period up to the First World War, it was not she but one of her former students who launched the Gymnastic Teachers' Suffrage Society. The increasingly desperate fight for the vote evidently impinged on Madame Bergman &Ouml;sterberg less than the fact that she herself had created for women a new profession that was to advance their economic and social freedom.<br>
<br>It was a profession that went with the grain of leadership culture in the last days of empire, invoking a sense of moral purpose and discipline which looked beyond the physical benefits of gym. The gym mistress, confident of what she was doing and with an authority which gave her poise, was central to the running of many girls' schools until the latter part of the twentieth century. Out of Madame Bergman &Ouml;sterberg's new profession there also came a newer one: physiotherapy.<br>
