<span class="headword">Knollys, Sir  Francis</span>  (1511/12&#150;1596), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the elder son of <a name="cosubject_15759"></a><span class="headword">Robert Knollys</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1520/21), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, and Lettice (<i>d</i>. 1557/8), daughter of Sir Thomas Peniston of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire. Robert was fifth in descent from Sir Thomas Knollys (<i>d</i>. 1435), lord mayor of London in 1399 and 1410, who directed the rebuilding of the Guildhall in 1400 and rebuilt St Antholin's Church in Watling Street. In 1488 Robert Knollys was one of Henry VII's henchmen, and late in that year was appointed to wait on Prince Arthur. He received a reward of &pound;5 for each of the three years 1488 to 1490, and when Henry VII met Archduke Philip in 1500 he accompanied the English king as one of the ushers of the chamber. He continued in the same office under Henry VIII, and received an annuity of &pound;20 on 15 November 1509, and a grant of Rookes Manor in Hampshire&#151;part of the confiscated property of Sir Richard Empson&#151;on 10 February 1511. On 9 July 1514 Robert and his wife were jointly granted the manor of Rotherfield Greys, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, in survivorship, at an annual rent of a red rose at midsummer. Other royal gifts followed. Knollys made his will on 13 November 1520, and it was proved on 19 June 1521. He was buried in the London church of St Helen, Bishopsgate. His widow became the second wife of Sir Robert Lee of Burston, Buckinghamshire. He died in 1537, and she became the second wife of Sir Thomas Tresham of Rushton, Northamptonshire, prior (under Mary I) of the knights of St John of Jerusalem. Her will, dated 28 June 1557, was proved on 11 June 1558.<br>
<br>Robert Knollys's career exhibits an interesting parallel to those of the founders of the Russell and Cecil dynasties. The service of each began under the first Tudor, continuing under his son. Like the Russells and the Cecils, Knollys was able to acquire lands and gentry status. Knollys, of course, died while his son was a child but seems to have established himself so well in the royal favour that Henry VIII extended his patronage to the son. His children included, besides Francis, a son, Henry, and two daughters, Mary and Jane. The latter married Sir Richard Wingfield of Kimbolton Castle. The son Henry (<i>d</i>. 1583) was in some favour with Edward VI and Elizabeth I. He went abroad with his brother Francis during Mary's reign. In 1562 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Germany to observe the temper of German protestants, and in 1569 was temporarily employed in warding both Mary, queen of Scots, at Tutbury and the duke of Norfolk in the Tower. He was MP for Grampound in 1547, New Shoreham in 1563, Guildford in 1571, and Christchurch in 1572. His will, dated 27 July 1583, was proved on 2 September.<br>
<br>Francis Knollys succeeded his father in 1524, although a contested claim to the inheritance was not settled until he secured an act of parliament in 1545. According to tradition he attended Magdalen College, Oxford, but there is no record of this. He sat in 1533 in the fifth session of the 1529 parliament, the result of a 1532 by-election. He must have found a patron, conceivably Cromwell. He almost certainly sat in the 1536 house and probably in 1539, but the constituency is not known in any of these cases. Before the next parliament he married, about 1540, Katherine (<i>c</i>.1523&#150;1569) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69747/', "Knollys, Katherine")</script>], the daughter of William Carey of Aldenham, Berkshire, and Mary, sister to Queen Anne Boleyn. Katherine's brother Henry, Lord Hunsdon, was later Knollys's colleague in the privy council. In 1545 he sat in parliament for Horsham as a nominee of his wife's kinsman the third duke of Norfolk. In 1547 he represented the newly enfranchised Cornish borough of Camelford, possibly as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Protector Somerset. He may have sat in the spring parliament of 1553 but the records are too sparse to make this certain.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Knollys's court career began with his appointment as a gentleman pensioner in that newly founded body in 1539; he served until 1544. He was master of the horse to Prince Edward by 1547. He also launched a military career, campaigning in the Flanders expedition of 1543 and with the king in northern France the following year. His service at Pinkie in 1547 earned him a knighthood. In Edward's reign he became constable of Wallingford Castle and steward of Ewelme. He was a JP for Oxfordshire from 1547 to 1554.<br>
<br>Knollys was moving in advanced protestant circles by 1551, when he attended discussions on the eucharist in Cecil's house. The precise circumstances of his conversion to the new faith are unknown, but the experience was a profound one. It shaped every aspect of his public career to the end of his life. Of the men who became his fellows on the council only Bedford shared his depth of religious conviction. There is doubtful evidence that he went to Lausanne immediately after Mary's accession to arrange for the reception of English exiles. He was certainly in England in 1554, since he was named as JP for Oxfordshire in February of that year and sold land in Cambridge, but by 1555&#150;6 he was a student at Basel. Later he and his family lived at Frankfurt, and it was from there that he returned to England at Elizabeth's accession, possibly even before the event. On 14 January 1559 the queen admitted him to the privy council and at the same time appointed him vice-chamberlain of the household. His wife became a lady of the bedchamber, a post she held until her death on 15 January 1569, aged thirty-nine; the queen was much attached to her, and paid for her funeral in Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>In the parliament which met in 1559 Knollys and Sir John Cooke were the two most prominent Marian exiles among its members. They had a key role to play: the bill designed to restore the Edwardian religious order was committed to their care. They piloted it successfully through the lower house only to see it emasculated in the upper. What role Knollys may have played in the post-Easter sitting is not known. Over the next four years he was employed in a variety of assignments. In 1560 he was dealing with the special Spanish ambassador, Glajon, sent to mediate between the English government and the Guise regency in Edinburgh, bringing the reassuring message that Spain would not intervene. In the same year Cecil considered him as a possible replacement for Throckmorton as ambassador in Paris, but he was ruled out as lacking adequate private means.<br>
<br>In 1562 Knollys was appointed captain at Portsmouth and placed in charge of sending supplies to the English force at Newhaven (Le Havre). As the enterprise faltered in 1563 he was asked to report on strategies of withdrawal, a move which he was urging, and in June was ordered to cross to Newhaven, but the withdrawal pre-empted a visit to the plague-ridden port. About the same time he was sent on a tour of inspection of defences in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Wight. Then in 1566 he was sent to Ireland for a two-month stint to advise Sir Henry Sidney, the lord deputy, on the O'Neill problem in Ulster. It was while he was there that he heard of the death of the treasurer of the chamber. Quick to apply for the vacant post, citing the burden of a family of twelve children, he won the appointment. He had already in 1565 been named captain of the guard. In 1570, when he was promoted treasurer of the household, he apparently laid down the other offices.<br>
<br>In 1568 a much more onerous responsibility fell on Knollys's shoulders, an assignment which, however, displayed the queen's confidence in her kinsman. On news of Mary Stuart's arrival in England in May 1568, Knollys was sent north to be her guardian. Accompanied by Lord Scrope, the warden of the west marches, he met the Scottish queen at Carlisle at the close of the month. Although impressed by her personality, he saw her from the first as a danger to the realm. In their initial encounter he responded to her invective against Moray by reminding her that there were occasions when the deposition of princes was justified&#151;<i>inter alia</i> murder&#151;a reply which reduced her to tears. After further dealings with Mary, Knollys and Scrope urged that she either be allowed to return to Scotland unimpeded by Elizabeth, or remain in England at the pleasure of the queen. Knollys believed she would return home only when French help was available. He warned of the risks of her escape &#145;with devices of toys or towels at windows&#146;  (Wright, 1.276&#150;80) and urged that she be moved further away from the border. In the following months he was forthright in arguing with Cecil that the queen must support Moray and if that meant exposing &#145;the spots in Mary's coat&#146;  (ibid., 1.280&#150;81), the sooner the better. He complained bitterly of Elizabeth's hesitation in making a decision, which, he said, weakened her friends and strengthened her enemies. By July he had persuaded Mary to move to the more secure situation of Bolton, achieving this on his own initiative without royal authority.<br>
<br>Mary remained in Knollys's custody until the end of 1568. In December Elizabeth sought to involve him in her tortuous dealings with Mary. He was to press on her a scheme by which she would abdicate and remain in England at the queen's pleasure. Moray would continue as regent and Prince James be brought to England for his education. In return the charges against her would be consigned to oblivion. All this was to be delivered as of his own devising. This was to be done before the arrival at Bolton of Mary's agent, the bishop of Ross, who was being purposely delayed in London. Knollys carried out his instructions but when Ross arrived he brought a very different proposal&#151;that Mary and James should reign jointly. Sir Francis scolded his mistress roundly for allowing Ross to suggest such an alternative. He went on to lecture the queen:<blockquote>Now as Your Majesty's judgement must needs be ruled by such affections and passions of your mind as happen to have dominion over you; so yet the resolutions digested by the deliberate consultations of your most faithful counsellor ought ever to be had in most account in their weighty affairs. (Haynes, 497&#150;8)</blockquote>He reiterated that she must disgrace Mary and support Moray. This was plain speaking. Within three weeks, in February 1569, Knollys had the pleasure of transferring his charge to the earl of Shrewsbury.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarymanager"></a>Parliamentary manager</h2>Knollys had another role, a major and continuing one, in the first dozen years of the reign, as manager of crown business in the Commons, where he sat in no fewer than eleven sessions. In 1559 he represented Arundel, probably through the good offices of his fellow councillor the earl of Arundel. In the same year he succeeded the late Lord Williams of Thame as <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Oxfordshire, and in 1564 he became high steward of the city of Oxford. From 1563 to 1593 without a break he represented the shire in parliament. His position enabled him to place his son Henry (<i>d</i>. 1582) as his fellow knight of the shire in 1572, and William (<i>d</i>. 1632) in 1584 and 1593. Edward (<i>d</i>. 1575) and Francis (<i>d</i>. 1648) served as burgesses for Oxford city between 1571 and 1589. Sir Francis Knollys's parliamentary patronage was large. In 1563 he most probably nominated the Taunton burgesses (he leased the castle and borough); in Oxfordshire he controlled the New Woodstock seat in 1571 and 1572, and at Banbury in 1563 his relative Francis Walsingham sat. From 1563 to 1586 one of the Knollys family always sat for Reading, where Leicester was patron. Indeed no fewer than six of his sons sat in the Elizabethan Commons, the largest family group in the house.<br>
<br>The government's business manager and its voice in the house, Knollys sat on all committees dealing with matters of concern to the government and was responsible for nominating speakers, carrying bills to and from the Lords, reporting on conferences with the upper house, reporting on the work of major committees, and&#151;often a painful task&#151;conveying the queen's will to the Commons. It was his special business to shepherd government measures on their way through the house, ensuring their successful passage. He had also to keep close watch on private initiatives which might cross the government's intentions or arouse the royal displeasure.<br>
<br>In 1559, sharing the leadership of the returned exiles with Sir Anthony Cooke, Knollys was a member of the committee which probably amended the government's <span class="roman">Supremacy Bill</span>. He also served in a commission to enforce the <span class="roman">Statute of Supremacy</span>. In 1563 he was the head of a committee which amended an anti-Catholic bill so as to make first refusal of the oath of supremacy subject to the penalty of <i>praemunire</i> and the second to death&#151;this against the queen's will: in debate he declared &#145;this business must be settled sword in hand and not by words and that he would be foremost in the struggle&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 2.410). In 1566 he played a prominent part in the exchange between the queen and parliament over her marriage. He delivered her message promising marriage, served on the conference with the Lords on the succession, was among the thirty MPs summoned to hear her further words on the subject, and then finally was the bearer of the royal command to cease debate on the issue. His committee appointments were numerous: five in 1563, six in 1566. Their subjects included the queen's revenues, coneys, informers, excess of apparel, drinking and swearing, and the garrison of Berwick.<br>
<br>The restless 1571 parliament loaded Knollys with difficult tasks. The religious radicals, led in the house by Strickland, were pressing for reform of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, a measure with which Knollys probably sympathized. Nevertheless, he did his duty in opposing the move, arguing that matters of ceremony as distinct from those of doctrine were solely for the queen's authority as supreme governor. He sought to sweeten the pill by suggesting that there were secret reasons why the queen did not want the move now. Then on the sequestration and imprisonment of Strickland, Knollys had to defend the royal action, asserting that the MP's offence lay not in his words uttered in the house but in his offering a bill against the queen's prerogative. Strickland, argued Knollys, erred in his zeal, but without malice to the royal dignity. Apart from this Knollys made a long speech on the subsidy and reported the subsequent committee. He spoke twice on the <span class="roman">Treason Bill</span>, and also on usury and vagabonds. He served on eleven other committees, chairing some of them; their subjects included coneys once again, along with recusant priests, church attendance, and other matters.<br>
<br>In 1572 Knollys had to deal once more with the problem of the Scottish queen. He had previously, in October 1569, been sent on a sensitive commission to arrest the duke of Norfolk, who had retired to his home ground at Kenninghall and seemed for a moment about to resist. Knollys brought him successfully to the Tower. That event triggered off the northern uprising among the gentry whose loyalty Knollys had questioned in 1568. Now, in the aftermath, parliament met in an agitated mood. On 12 May 1572 a committee was appointed to confer with the Lords on the queen of Scots. After the report on the conference was heard, Knollys urged a further meeting. There followed a move to bring forward the succession question. It was Knollys's business to stifle this move. While declaring his own wish for a settlement of the succession, he warned that it would founder on royal opposition and urged prayer to God to change the queen's heart. When a proposal was made to petition the queen to execute Mary, Knollys argued it was best to approach the queen &#145;by way of opinion [rather] than request&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 2.411). Given his views on the queen of Scots, it must have cost him something to take this line. When the queen rejected a bill of attainder, Knollys saw that the Commons were still unsatisfied and suggested a petition of both houses urging the queen to reconsider. The petition was duly drawn up and presented; the royal response was to forbid discussion of the Scottish queen's matter.<br>
<br>The Commons now turned to the question of Norfolk, in the Tower under sentence of death; the house began to agitate for his execution. Knollys's own view was that were the duke his brother, he would have him dead, but he urged delay in pressing the queen. The house, persuaded by his argument, agreed to postpone action until the following Monday. Before the house sat that morning Norfolk went to the block. In the aftermath of that event the Commons was concerned with the case of Arthur Hall, a dependant of Norfolk's, who was brought before the bar. Knollys again spoke against punishing Hall for his opinions, urging moderation in dealing with a rash head and a fool.<br>
<br>There was ample routine business which involved Knollys, but the largest piece was a bill giving clergy the right to vary the order of service by omissions or additions, with episcopal approval. Knollys heartily approved of the measure, declaring &#145;that diverse mischiefs grew by the straitness of the statute for uniformity of common prayer&#146;, for which the bill offered remedy  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 2.412). But he was aware that the preamble, critical of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, would offend the queen. Accordingly he managed its removal from the bill as well as eliminating the more extreme changes proposed by the bill's backers. At this juncture Elizabeth asked to see the religious bills before the house. When she declared her dislike for this measure, Knollys defended it, showing her that even in the Chapel Royal the prescribed order of the prayer book was daily broken. The queen responded graciously and asserted that she would take all good protestants to her protection. The bill passed both houses but in spite of her fair words did not receive her assent.<br>
<br>1572 was the last parliament when Knollys bore the burden of responsibility for managing the house. That task was now taken on by Sir Christopher Hatton and Sir Walter Mildmay. Knollys, now sixty, continued to play an active role in parliament. In the first session of 1576 he sat on the committee examining Peter Wentworth, bringing in the report which recommended Wentworth's committal to the Tower. Besides this committee he sat on nearly a dozen others. In the second session he was similarly burdened, and spoke against Paul Wentworth's motion for a public fast. In 1584 he was no less busy, again sitting on a round dozen committees, reporting a bill against seditious words and practices, and attending a conference with the Lords on that subject. He also spoke against the puritans' bold attack on the establishment in the book and bill motion. Not until 1586&#150;7 did his activities begin to diminish, but he did sit on the inter-house conference on the fate of Mary Stuart and moved the subsidy bill to pay for the newly launched war in the Low Countries. Then in 1589 his duties again increased with the chairmanship of half a dozen committees, including that on the vexed question of purveyance. In 1593, at eighty-one, he still chaired at least two committees.<h2>
<a name="Privycouncillor"></a>Privy councillor</h2>Of Knollys's activities as privy councillor the record is sparse, but a surviving letter of January 1578 to Secretary Wilson is revealing. The queen, it seems, was unwilling to listen to Knollys's advice, so he poured his frustrated anguish into Wilson's ears. According to the letter, Knollys knows the queen is loath to hear him, &#145;and indeed my speech hath no grave worthie of her Majestie's ears &hellip; and therefore I am the more silent, altho when I may be heard &hellip; rather than my silence shold be gyltie of her danger, I do utter my unworthy speech unto her Majestie&#146;. He knows the queen must be obeyed in all matters which do not touch the danger of her estate, but if she does &#145;not supress and subject her own will and her own affections unto sound advice of open cownsayle in matters touching the preventing of her danger, she will be utterly overthrown&#146;. Who will give safe counsel if she will not listen? &#145;Nay, who will not shrinkingly &hellip; play the partes of Richard the Second's men than to enter into the odious office of crossing her Majestie's wylle?&#146; Specifically she must act to prevent a Spanish conquest of the Low Countries, to check the drift of Scotland into French arms, and to halt papist activity. Turning to domestic matters, he bewails the suspension of Archbishop Grindal, which will raise the &#145;pride and practice&#146; of papists. Thinking on all this leads him to wish for a private life; he is not cut out to be a courtier. He ends by praying Wilson to hide nothing of this letter from the queen  (Wright, 2.74&#150;6).<br>
<br>In August of the same year Knollys rejoiced in the queen's change of mind in agreeing to aid the states general; had she acted sooner&#151;rejecting the advice of those who feared war with Spain&#151;the present crisis might have been avoided. It might be too late now. Fearful of a Spanish victory which might lead to a Franco-Spanish alliance against England, Knollys was equally concerned that French support for the rebels would give them dominance in the Netherlands. Two years later, during the prolonged episode of the Anjou match, Knollys wrote to Leicester outlining his objections. The earl was now his son-in-law; his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8159/', "Lettice Dudley")</script>, widowed by the first earl of Essex, had married Leicester. In 1585 Knollys was a member of the council committee to negotiate the treaty of alliance with the Dutch along with Burghley, Leicester, Hatton, Walsingham, Admiral Howard, and his brother-in-law Hunsdon. Later in the year the same body of men (minus Leicester) was busy with instructions for the treasurer at war.<h2>
<a name="Puritanmilitant"></a>Puritan militant</h2>Knollys had always been sympathetic to those who found the 1559 settlement but halfly reformed. He gave voice to these sentiments in his lamentations on Grindal's fate. He was alarmed, however, by the manifestations of the religious left. In 1581 he wrote to the chancellors of the two universities to condemn a recently published English translation of a work by Sebastian Castellio with its freewill doctrines. Knollys blamed the bishop of London, John Aylmer, for failing in his role as clerical censor in prohibiting publication. Such writing would discredit mainstream protestantism, giving a weapon to the papists, who, he feared, were gaining in strength and who were more dangerous than all the sects. In 1584 he would vote against the radical proposals embodied in the bill and the book.<br>
<br>It was the accession of John Whitgift to the primacy and his ensuing programme of enforced clerical conformity that aroused Knollys to active intervention in the affairs of the church. The matter was one of practice rather than doctrine. The new archbishop had required of all clergy unqualified subscription to three articles accepting the royal governorship, the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Those refusing the required oath were suspended. When the parliament of 1584 met, members of the lower house initiated a petition to the queen which called for the restoration of the suspended clergy, a bar on proceedings against clergy who omitted any part of the prayer book, and the suspension of unqualified and unlearned clergy. Knollys headed the delegation which sought the Lords' participation in the petition. The upper house, after some hesitation, were persuaded to support the document. It was effectually denied by the queen.<br>
<br>In May some of the councillors wrote to Whitgift in behalf of the suspended clergy. Knollys followed with a letter to the primate in June, urging Whitgift to &#145;open the mouths&#146; of the zealous preacher non-signers by lifting their suspension. Their preaching was sorely needed in the campaign against the papists, whose words were all too persuasive to a people naturally given to superstition and idolatry. They could be withstood only by preaching. The cause was one not only of religion but of policy, the very maintenance of the queen's personal safety, threatened as it was by a still untamed papistry. Knollys also sent Whitgift a writing which argued the equality of all clerics and impugned episcopal authority as encroaching on the royal supremacy. Whitgift refused Knollys's request, and the latter turned to Burghley for support against a policy which silenced sound preaching while neglecting the popish menace.<br>
<br>In 1589 Knollys returned to the fray. The archbishop had made a visitation of Peterborough diocese. Puritan sources sent a copy of the articles to Knollys, who wrote indignantly to Burghley demanding a public acknowledgement by the bishops that they had no superiority over their brethren except as they were given authority by the queen. He followed this by a denunciation of the covetous ambition of church governors who despised the humble doctrine of Christ's government, citing the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as asserting the equality of all ministers. There followed a bombardment of letters to Burghley, denouncing the misuse of episcopal authority on biblical authority. Then, shifting ground, he argued the legal case. Henry VIII had granted the bishops the same authority as their predecessors, but Cranmer had secured a statute conferring legal powers. This, however, had been repealed in the present reign, hence the illegality of ecclesiastical courts. These activities had now won the queen's disapproval. In 1590 or 1591 she banned Knollys from her presence. This was not the first occasion of royal displeasure; some years earlier she had forbidden him to deal with the puritans.<br>
<br>In 1591 Cartwright and Travers had been ordered to appear before Star Chamber. Knollys had not been notified, but soon found out that the chancellor had proposed to afforce the court with a DD and a DCL. Asked his opinion of this man, Knollys responded that since the queen would not allow him to speak his conscience he could answer only with her consent, but he reiterated his argument against episcopal authority and desired it to be debated publicly. He then appealed to Burghley, bemoaning the strait in which he found himself. It was deadly grief to him to offend the queen publicly, yet he would rather die than impugn her safety by a pleasing speech. He asked Burghley to show his letter to the queen so that she might give him leave to speak his conscience publicly&#151;or else, if this denied, to make him a private man.<br>
<br>Knollys's position in these years had moved beyond objection to specific acts of the archbishop to an assault on the episcopal office as exercised by Whitgift. In his view the archbishop was asserting a divine right origin for his authority and hence independence of, if not superiority to, the crown. Knollys was insistent that bishops had no inherent superiority over other clergy, and that whatever powers they exercised derived solely from the queen.<br>
<br>There seems to have been a reconciliation with the queen, since Knollys wrote in January 1592 of a conversation with her in which she declared she feared puritans more than papists, to which he retorted that the former could only act through parliament with her consent. He urged that they be given open and fair trial to defend themselves against charges of treason and sedition. The queen's attitude towards the puritans countered Knollys's repeated assertion that what was at stake was an argument not merely about ecclesiastical matters but about the queen's safety. He had developed an obsessive notion of the link between abuses of episcopal authority and the queen's security. Only through the preaching which Whitgift forbade could the deadly menace of papistry be crushed.<br>
<br>Knollys continued indefatigable in the cause. In his last parliament, that of 1593, he again championed the puritans. Early in the session James Morice brought forward a bill which assailed ecclesiastical jurisdiction and specifically forbade the requirement to subscribe to the contentious articles set out by Whitgift. Knollys spoke out boldly in its favour: the bill was intended to reform abuses. If bishops were indeed acting illegally, they should suffer the penalties of <i>praemunire</i>. In a letter to Burghley, Knollys set out what he saw as the larger issue. The clergy sought to have a separate clerical government, exempt from the actions of the temporal government. That was his final word on the subject. He continued in council attendance but in much diminished frequency. He died on 19 July 1596, and was buried at Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Knollys was consistent in his deep-rooted loyalty to evangelical protestantism, but in his public career bowed, sometimes reluctantly, to his royal mistress's differing views. He became an articulate champion of the evangelical party and a bold critic of the official ecclesiastical policy only in the last decade of his life. As he saw it, Whitgift's efforts to ensure conformity in worship and doctrine would stifle the preaching of the gospel, halt the progress of renewed reform, and lose the battle against a still unconquered papistry. The queen and the archbishop saw the puritans as a menace to the unity of the church just as dangerous as the papists. Those who would have sympathized with Knollys were fast disappearing. He was virtually the sole survivor of the heady Edwardian years, for him the first stage in what was to be a continuing work of reform. Such a conception was in stark contrast to the royal view, which saw the queen defending a completed and unified order under attack by irresponsible dissidents. Yet although Elizabeth silenced Knollys, he retained her confidence as a councillor. In 1593 she rewarded him with the Order of the Garter.<br>
<br>Knollys had been granted the lordship and manor of Caversham with lands in Berkshire, Oxfordshire, and Reading by Edward VI. In 1563 and 1564 Elizabeth granted Sir Francis and &#145;our beloved kinswoman&#146;, his wife, lands in Buckinghamshire, Somerset (seven manors), Berkshire, and Oxfordshire. Knollys exchanged the Somerset lands for property near Reading. He acquired control of Kimbolton Castle, Huntingdonshire, as guardian (with Walter Mildmay) of the estates of his nephew and great-nephew the Wingfields, Charles and Edward.<br>
<br>Knollys had at least seven sons and four daughters. The eldest son, Henry, predeceased his father, but after a considerable public career. An MP and esquire of the body, he married the daughter of the privy councillor Sir Ambrose Cave. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15760/', "William Knollys")</script>, the second son, succeeded to his father's offices and won promotion and an earldom. Of the others, all had parliamentary careers. Of the four daughters, Lettice married first Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, to whom she bore Robert, the famous second earl. Second, she married Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and lastly Sir Christopher Blount. Cecilia, maid of honour to the queen, married Sir Thomas Leighton, captain of Guernsey; Anne married Thomas, Lord De La Warr; and Katherine married first Gerald Fitzgerald, Lord Offaly, and second Sir Philip Boteler.<br>
