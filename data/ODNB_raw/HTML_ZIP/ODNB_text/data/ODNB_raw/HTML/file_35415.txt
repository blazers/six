<span class="headword">Pattison,  Andrew Seth  Pringle-</span>  (1856&#150;1931), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born Andrew Seth on 20 December 1856 at 1 West Claremont Street, Edinburgh, the second of seven children of Smith Kinmont Seth, bank clerk, and his wife, Margaret (1830&#150;1911), daughter of Andrew Little, farmer, of Middle Blainslie, Berwickshire. He added Pringle-Pattison to his name in 1898 as a condition of receiving a bequest. He was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh and at Edinburgh University (1873&#150;8), where he graduated with firsts in classics and philosophy.<br>
<br>After graduation Seth studied at Berlin, Jena, and G&ouml;ttingen (1878&#150;80), hoping to learn more of German idealist philosophy, which was becoming fashionable in Britain. In Germany, however, scientific materialism was in fashion, and he learned more of German idealism from reading the idealists than from attending German universities. At G&ouml;ttingen he met Lotze, but was disappointed to find he was giving only introductory lectures. The results of his studies appeared in his first book, <span class="italic">The Development from Kant to Hegel</span> (1882).<br>
<br>On returning to Edinburgh, Seth became the assistant to his former teacher Campbell Fraser. During the three years he held this not very lucrative position he supplemented his income writing leaders and reviews for <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>. He also achieved philosophical prominence by compiling, with R. B. Haldane, <span class="italic">Essays in Philosophical Criticism</span> (1883), the manifesto of the emerging neo-Hegelian movement that dominated British philosophy for the next twenty years. On the strength of this he was appointed professor of logic and philosophy at University College, Cardiff, a post which he held from 1883 to 1887. In 1884 he married Eva Stropp, whom he had met in Berlin, daughter of Albrecht Stropp, of Bogislavitz, Silesia. They had four sons (the youngest was killed in action in 1916) and three daughters (the eldest died in infancy). His wife died in 1928.<br>
<br>From Cardiff Seth visited Edinburgh to give two lecture series sponsored by A. J. Balfour specifically to give Seth &#145;an opportunity of producing original work&#146;  (Capper, 454). Two of his most important books resulted: <span class="italic">Scottish Philosophy</span> (1885) and <span class="italic">Hegelianism and Personality</span> (1887). A third series, on realism, was given in 1891 (published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Review</span>, 1892&#150;3; repr. as <span class="italic">The Balfour Lectures on Realism</span>, 1933). Seth meanwhile had moved in 1887 to St Andrews as professor of logic, rhetoric, and metaphysics, and in 1891 back to Edinburgh, where he replaced Fraser as professor of logic and metaphysics, a post he held until 1919. (From 1898 to 1924 the Edinburgh chair in moral philosophy was held by his younger brother James.)<br>
<br>In 1898 Seth inherited, from the widow of a very distant relative, a country estate, The Haining, near Selkirk, together with 7000 acres. He took his duties as a landowner seriously, which caused a long interruption in his career as an author. By mid-life he looked the part of a laird. He was a tall man, &#145;not very lithe&#146; John Laird reported tactfully  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), with a magnificent white beard. Shyness prevented him from being a great debater: &#145;unready of speech he hugged the shelter of his manuscript, reading it beautifully to large classes which sometimes were almost openly restive&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Apart from a collection of essays (<span class="italic">Philosophical Radicals</span>, 1907, and <span class="italic">Two Lectures on Theism</span>, 1902) delivered at Princeton in 1896, Pringle-Pattison's subsequent books arose from his giving two double series of Gifford lectures: the first (1912&#150;13) resulted in <span class="italic">The Idea of God in the Light of Recent Philosophy</span> (1917); the second (1921&#150;3) gave rise to <span class="italic">The Idea of Immortality</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Studies in the Philosophy of Religion</span> (1930)&#151;the last more historical than philosophical.<br>
<br>Pringle-Pattison's earliest writings seemed to place him in the vanguard of the British Hegelian movement. His contribution to <span class="italic">Essays in Philosophical Criticism</span> attacked Kant for assuming that the mind was distinct from the things acting upon it, thereby admitting an unbridgeable gap between phenomena and noumena. He claimed that Hegel had shown how self-consciousness closed the gap by giving rise to ethical experience through which access to noumena was possible.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Hegelianism and Personality</span>, however, Pringle-Pattison broke ranks with the Hegelians, not on the fundamental role of self-consciousness, but on Hegel's locating self-consciousness in the Absolute rather than in individual persons. This he condemned as excessive abstraction at the expense of concrete particularity. His philosophy was thus a form of personal idealism, in contrast to the absolute idealism of Hegel and Bradley. In his essay on Kant he wrote: &#145;The individual is individualised only by his relations to the totality of the intelligible world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essays in Philosophical Criticism</span>, 34). In <span class="italic">Hegelianism and Personality</span>, however, he wrote of selves in terms reminiscent of Leibniz's monads: &#145;Each self is a unique existence, which is perfectly <i>impervious</i> &hellip; to other selves&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hegelianism and Personality</span>, 216).<br>
<br>The reasons for this change are found partly in the influence of Lotze, another idealist inclined to monadology, but more importantly in his intervening book <span class="italic">Scottish Philosophy</span>, revealingly subtitled <span class="italic">A Comparison of the Scottish and German Answers to Hume</span>. In it he investigated the Scottish common-sense philosophy of Thomas Reid and took from it the view, <i>contra</i> Hume, that philosophy could never challenge our &#145;natural beliefs&#146; in the external world, personal identity, and God. Having admitted all three, Pringle-Pattison faced the problem of explaining their interactions: the very problem Kant had been castigated for shirking. He attempted a solution in the <span class="italic">Balfour Lectures on Realism</span>, where he added a realist element to his already doubtfully consistent collection of beliefs. This never satisfied him: he was as unable to deny idealism as he was the external world. Idealist critics complained that, by insisting both that the external world was mind-independent and that our access to it was by means of ideas, he had reverted to the then universally discredited representational realism of Locke. Ironically, it was the unresolved tensions in his work that enhanced its appeal to many late Victorian thinkers, who&#151;moved on the one side by the scientific materialism of the 1860s and on the other by older religious lines of thought as well as newer idealist ones&#151;were anxious to reconcile these. Although the <span class="italic">Lectures on Realism</span> did not achieve the hoped-for reconciliation, they do contain some of his more interesting claims. For example, he argued that only by presupposing realism could idealism or any other philosophy be stated. &#145;Idealism&#146;, he says  (<span class="italic">Balfour Lectures on Realism</span>, 192), &#145;exists only as a criticism of Realism&#146;. This anticipates, though for somewhat different reasons, a position taken by many ordinary language philosophers half a century later, for example P. F. Strawson, who argued that the existence of publicly identifiable material bodies was a necessary precondition for language.<br>
<br>Pringle-Pattison's later attempts to solve the problem are less interesting. In <span class="italic">The Idea of God</span> he blurs many of his earlier distinctions. He repents of describing selves as &#145;impervious&#146; and claims that, while nature exists independently of man, it none the less exists <i>for</i> man. Quite how the system works is &#145;incomprehensible&#146; to finite minds, but that it does so is a &#145;primary certainty&#146; which &#145;no speculative difficulties could over-ride&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Idea of God in the Light of Recent Philosophy</span>, 391).<br>
<br>Pringle-Pattison's philosophy &#145;had a distinct attraction for philosophers of a not too rigorous cast of mind, in search of a philosophy that would tread a comfortable <i>via media</i> between naturalism and Absolutism, science and religion, the rights of personality and the demands of the community&#146;  (Passmore, 74). He was elected to the British Academy in 1904. He died at The Haining on 1 September 1931, and was buried at Morningside cemetery, Edinburgh, three days later.<br>
