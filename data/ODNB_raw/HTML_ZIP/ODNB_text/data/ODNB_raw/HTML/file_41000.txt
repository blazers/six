<span class="headword">Williams,  Howard</span>  (1837&#150;1931), <span class="occ">writer and advocate of vegetarianism</span>, was born on 6 January 1837, at Whatley rectory, Somerset, the fifth son of the Revd Hamilton John Williams (1796&#150;1879) and his wife, Margaret Sophia, daughter of Thomas Taunton. He was educated at home and was admitted as a pensioner to St John's College, Cambridge, on 1 July 1856, graduating BA in 1860 and MA in 1863. On 20 November 1860 he married Eliza Smith, daughter of Robert Webb Smith, captain in the Indian army; there is no record of any offspring.<br>
<br>Williams may have had private means, possibly assisted by tutoring, since he had no known career other than scholarly writing. His first book, <span class="italic">The Superstitions of Witchcraft</span>, was published in 1865. Williams turned vegetarian in 1872 and also became an anti-vivisectionist. In 1883 he published the book that made his name, the <span class="italic">Ethics of Diet, or, A Cantena of Authorities Deprecatory of the Practise of Flesh-Eating</span>. The <span class="italic">Ethics of Diet</span> was the first comprehensive history of European vegetarianism, from Pythagoras to contemporary nineteenth-century dietary reformers, and is still authoritative, and a vegetarian classic. It used the portrait form customary to hagiography, listing fifty &#145;great men&#146; and their literary productions on vegetarianism, with a further seventeen added to the second edition in 1896. It was turned into a popular edition in 1906 and was translated into Swedish, and more famously into Russian by Count Tolstoy. Williams turned to humanitarianism in the 1880s, being present at the founding of the Humanitarian League in 1890, and was on its council for some years thereafter. He wrote the &#145;Pioneers of humanity&#146; for the league's journal in 1907; this article later became a popular pamphlet. Williams continued scholarly work on other subjects in the 1880s, bringing out a survey of Pope and Swift's letters in 1885, and translating a selection of Lucian's dialogues in 1887, but increasingly preferred to live a private life gardening, tutoring, and going canoeing, from his home at Aspley Guise near Woburn in Bedfordshire. He died at Aspley Guise on 21 September 1931.<br>
