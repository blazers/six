<span class="headword">Maihew,  Edward</span>  (1568/9&#150;1625), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk</span>, was born at Dinton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, into a firmly Catholic family. As a boy he was sent, in 1583, to the English College, then at Rheims, from where he proceeded in 1590 to Rome, being admitted to the English College there on 23 October. Ordained about 1595 he spent twelve years on the English mission. Talented and well read, he became attracted to the Benedictine order and was professed as a member of the Cassinese congregation by Anselm Beech. Thomas Preston, leader of the first English monks to come from the Italian monasteries of the Cassinese congregation, gave him the monastic habit and took him, with another priest, Robert Vincent Sadler, to meet Sigebert Buckley, last survivor of the Marian community of Westminster Abbey. The meeting probably took place in Buckley's lodgings, somewhere in London and not, as sometimes alleged, in the Gatehouse prison. In a famous scene, on 21 November 1607, Buckley aggregated them to himself not only as the sole member of Westminster Abbey but also of what Augustine Baker considered &#145;the whole old Congregation of the Order in England&#146;  (Connolly, &#145;Buckley affair&#146;, 62). Baker thought that this was planned while the monks were still in Italy.<br>
<br>When the Westminster monks were given an equal share in the property of St Laurence's at Dieulouard, near Metz, in Lorraine, Maihew withdrew from the mission and soon afterwards, in 1614, became prior (superior) of the monastery. His Cassinese background placed him among the supporters of strict observance who went to Dieulouard, and his enthusiasm for old ways may have irritated those of other opinions. He played a considerable part in the negotiations for the uniting of the various groups of English monks into a &#145;restored and if need be renewed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ex incumbenti</span>, 1619) English Benedictine congregation, acting as one of the nine definitors elected in 1617 to this end.<br>
<br>As a young man in the English College in Rome (1590&#150;94) Maihew wrote some saints' lives, borrowing text from the Jesuit William Good, the recently deceased college confessor, who as a boy had served mass at pre-dissolution Glastonbury. These he later used when he wrote his <span class="italic">Congregationis Anglicanae ordinis sanctissimi Benedicti trophaea</span> (4 vols., 1619&#150;25), a paean of praise for what he regarded as the old English congregation from the time of St Augustine. This was subjected to a fierce counter-attack by the brilliant and wayward John Barnes, a Benedictine of the Spanish party, teaching in anti-Spanish France. His <span class="italic">Examen trophaeorum congregationis praetensae Anglicanae</span> claimed that historically English monasteries had always been under the congregation of Cluny, to which he was now attached. His work in turn promoted the principal manifesto of the renewed Benedictine mission to England, the <span class="italic">Apostolatus Benedictinorum in Anglia</span> (1626) by Baker and Leander Jones and edited by Clement Reyner.<br>
<br>Maihew had strong views on strict observance of monastic tradition and the rule, and Dieulouard under his leadership gained an impressive reputation. In 1623 he was appointed to be vicar to the nuns at the new English Benedictine convent at Cambrai, near Lille. He died there on 14 September 1625 aged fifty-six, and was buried in the church of St Vedast. He had edited <span class="italic">Sacra institutio baptizandi</span> (1604), the administration of the sacraments according to the Sarum usage published with his notes, and wrote <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Grounds of the Old and New Religion</span> (1608), <span class="italic">A Paradise of Prayers and Meditations</span> (1613), and possibly other works.<br>
