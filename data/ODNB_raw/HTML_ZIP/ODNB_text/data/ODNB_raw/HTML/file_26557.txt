<span class="headword">Stokes,  John Lort</span>  (1812&#150;1885), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the second son of Henry Stokes of Scotchwell near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of George Phillips MD of Prickeston, Pembrokeshire. He entered the navy on 20 September 1824 on the <i>Prince Regent</i> (120 guns). In October 1825 he was sent to the <i>Beagle</i>, then fitting out under Commander Pringle Stokes, for surveys in South American waters, in company with the <i>Adventure</i>, commanded by Captain Philip Parker King. On the death of Commander King in November 1828, Robert FitzRoy was promoted, and Stokes served with him until the return of the <i>Beagle</i> to England in 1830, and again, when the <i>Beagle</i> was recommissioned, from 1831 to 1836, during which period Charles Darwin was naturalist on board. On 10 January 1837 Stokes was promoted lieutenant, and when, in February, the <i>Beagle</i> was recommissioned by her former first lieutenant, Commander John Clements Wickham, for surveying in Australasian waters, Stokes was again appointed to her. In March 1841 Wickham was invalided home, and Stokes succeeded to the command.<br>
<br>For the next two years Stokes was principally engaged in surveys of Timor and New Zealand. In September 1843 he arrived in England after serving in the <i>Beagle</i> for nearly eighteen years. After his return home he wrote <span class="italic">Discoveries in Australia, with an account of the coasts and rivers explored and surveyed during the voyage of the Beagle, 1837&#150;1843</span> (2 vols., 1846). On 4 July 1846 he was promoted captain, and on 14 October 1847 was appointed to the steam vessel <i>Acheron</i> employed for the next four years on surveys of New Zealand. At the end of 1851 the <i>Acheron</i> was paid off at Sydney, and for a few years Stokes was on half pay. From 1860 to 1863 he was employed in surveying the coasts of the English Channel. He was one of three officers considered for the post of hydrographer of the navy after the death of Rear-Admiral John Washington in 1863, but was not selected. Shortly afterwards he retired. He was promoted rear-admiral on the retired list on 9 February 1864, vice-admiral on 14 July 1871, and admiral on 1 August 1877. In January 1841, at Port Phillip, Melbourne, he married Fanny Jane (<i>d</i>. 1841), daughter of Major Marlay. He later married Louisa French, daughter of R. Partridge and widow of H. J. Garratt; they had at least one child. His second wife survived him. He died at his home in Scotchwell on 11 June 1885.<br>
