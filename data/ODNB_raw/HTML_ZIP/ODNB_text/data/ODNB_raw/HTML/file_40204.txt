<span class="headword">Hastings,  Francis John Clarence Westenra Plantagenet</span>, sixteenth earl of Huntingdon <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Jack Huntingdon]</span>  (1901&#150;1990), <span class="occ">artist and politician</span>, was born on 30 January 1901 in Manchester Square, London, the only son and youngest of three children of Warner Francis John Plantagenet Hastings, fifteenth earl of Huntingdon 
    (<i>b</i>. 1868; whom he succeeded in 1939)
  , and his wife, (Maud) Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Sir Samuel Wilson, MP for Portsmouth. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he played in the university polo team and obtained a third class in modern history in 1923. His forename Plantagenet commemorated the descent of the earls of Huntingdon from George, duke of Clarence, brother of Edward IV, through Clarence's great-granddaughter Katherine Pole, who married Francis Hastings, second earl of Huntingdon. But the claim of his ancestor Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, to succeed Elizabeth I did not pass to him, having descended through a daughter of the ninth earl. Huntingdon was more interested in an alleged but impossible descent from Robin Hood, described in folklore as the earl of Huntingdon.<br>
<br>In 1925 Jack Huntingdon, who painted under the name John Hastings, married (Maria) Cristina (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of the wealthy Marchese Casati, head of one of the families which had ruled Milan for centuries. They travelled extensively in Australia and the Pacific, living for a while on the island of Moorea, after which they named their only child, a daughter. In San Francisco the couple met Diego Rivera, the celebrated Mexican communist mural painter. Huntingdon, who had studied at the Slade School of Art after leaving Oxford, became a pupil of Rivera's and learned the technique of fresco. He became Rivera's assistant, branching out into mural painting on his own account. In 1933 he painted a mural depicting dentistry in the Hall of Science at the Chicago World Fair, to accompany a display of George Washington's teeth. Already inclined to be left-wing at Oxford, he was further influenced by Rivera's ideology, and involved himself in the Spanish Civil War, taking medical assistance to republicans. His parents' anger at his marriage to a Roman Catholic foreigner, who shared their son's political outlook and eventually became a communist, was not assuaged by her high aristocratic lineage and there was a long breach during which the couple had little money other than a legacy from his grandmother.<br>
<br>On return to England, Huntingdon in 1935 painted a remarkable 10 feet by 20 feet fresco on a wall in the Marx Memorial Library, Clerkenwell Green, London, entitled <span class="italic">Worker of the Future Upsetting the Economic Chaos of the Present</span>. Though slightly wooden in the Soviet realist manner, it had distinctive original and pleasing touches. For his friend Lord Faringdon, the eccentric and rich socialist, he painted murals at Buscot Park depicting local Labour Party activities. Despite his far-left phase, he was a second lieutenant (Territorial Army) in the Royal Horse Guards. He was deputy controller of civil defence for Andover from 1941 to July 1945, when he joined Attlee's government as parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. He stayed there until November 1950, when he left politics for the painting he preferred.<br>
<br>As Huntingdon's faith in socialism declined, his paintings abandoned ideology for almost surrealist shapes and writhings of serpents in bright colours, expressing cheerful distaste for conventional restraints, whatever their provenance. He was chairman of the Society of Mural Painters in 1951&#150;8 and his works were widely exhibited. Among his murals are those at Birmingham University (1965), the Women's Press Club in London (1950), and the Casa dello Strozzato, Tuscany (early 1970s). He taught fresco at the Camberwell and Central schools of art in London.<br>
<br>Huntingdon's marriage to the strong-willed Cristina, whose southern temperament did not easily fit with his gentler, more placid English ways, ended with divorce in 1943 and she married Wogan Phillips (previously married to Rosamond Lehmann) who, as the second Baron Milford, was the first communist to take his seat in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Tall, athletic, and an expert yachtsman, Huntingdon strongly resembled the portrait he owned of the Elizabethan third earl in the reddish colour of his hair and finely delineated features. He played a number of musical instruments well and was a wine connoisseur with impeccable taste. He was the quintessence of a cultured, civilized man and in addition to his talents as a painter he was the author of two intelligently written books, <span class="italic">Commonsense about India</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">The Golden Octopus</span> (1928), a book of legends of the south seas. A delightful, convivial companion with a lively, intelligent wit, full of kindness and amusing stories and quick to laugh at himself, he was vague, gentle, courteous, and charming, with exquisite manners sometimes taken for weakness, but he was politely resolute in avoiding inconvenience to himself. When his second wife, the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55086/', "Margaret Lane (1907&#150;1994)")</script>, whom he married in 1944, proposed that her father should live with them, he said nothing but quietly packed his bags ready to move out. She was formerly the wife of Bryan Wallace and daughter of Harry George Lane, newspaper editor, of Vernham Dean, Andover. This second marriage ran less excitingly and more smoothly than the first. From it there were two daughters, of whom one, Lady Selina Hastings, wrote a number of successful biographies. Huntingdon died on 24 August 1990 in a nursing home in Beaulieu, Hampshire. He was succeeded in the earldom by a first cousin once removed, William Edward Robin Hood Hastings Bass (<i>b</i>. 1948).<br>
