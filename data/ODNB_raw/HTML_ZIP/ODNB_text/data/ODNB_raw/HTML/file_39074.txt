<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Greig,  Teresa Mary  Billington-</span>  (1876&#150;1964), <span class="occ">suffragette and political theorist</span>, was born at 197 Friargate, Preston, Lancashire, on 15 October 1876, the second daughter of William Billington, variously described as an engineer, shopkeeper, and shipping clerk, and his wife, Helen (or Ellen) Wilson. She was educated until the age of thirteen at the Convent of Notre Dame, Blackburn. At seventeen she ran away from home, escaping the burdens of domestic and waged labour. Her uncle took her in at Manchester, where she trained as a pupil teacher at St Edmund's and studied, organized, and debated at the Ancoats University settlement. In 1903 she became a teacher in a Manchester elementary school. She rejected Roman Catholicism in favour of militant socialist agnosticism and was transferred to a Jewish school, with the help of Emmeline Pankhurst, to prevent her being sacked for refusing to give prescribed religious teaching.<br>
<br>In April 1904 Billington helped to organize the Manchester teachers' equal pay league, having joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) as a major speaker shortly before. She had started a career in political activism very young because she had exceptional oratorical and administrative skills, reinforced by self-confidence. In 1905 she became a paid organizer for the Independent Labour Party. Sylvia Pankhurst described her as &#145;a large, powerfully built woman, with a round pleasant face&#146;, who &#145;sought to be considered unconventional&#146;. Others more charitable noted her green eyes and inspiring vigour  (Pankhurst, 187). In May 1906 she helped to organize a major suffrage deputation from the East End of London to parliament, and participated in the militant campaign of disrupting cabinet members' public appearances. She horsewhipped the stewards who ejected her from Asquith's meeting in Northampton. She spent some periods in Holloway prison, always protesting against the illegitimacy of a man-made legal system. She has been described as the non-violent militant but she was fined in July 1906 for dealing a return blow with her fist to a policeman in Cavendish Square, crying &#145;You shall not strike our women!&#146;  (ibid., 210, 212&#150;13). She was among those arrested and imprisoned after creating a disturbance at the opening of parliament in October 1906 in protest against the government's refusal to include women's suffrage in its legislative programme. A character sketch of her by Frederick Pethick-Lawrence singled out her moral courage, and J. J. Mallon suggested that she had intransigence and passion too: &#145;There will be quick loves but equally quick repulsions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Non-Violent Militant</span>, 7).<br>
<br>In autumn 1906 Billington went to Scotland to organize WSPU branches. She took part in the by-election campaign at Aberdeen South in February 1907, when the WSPU pursued its line of opposing all Liberal candidates, regardless of their views on women's suffrage. During this hectic period she married in Glasgow, on 8 February 1907, a socialist businessman, Frederick Lewis Greig (1875/6&#150;1961), who worked as a manager for a billiard table manufacturer. He was the son of Frederick Murray Greig, a saddler. Their two names were united in a nuptial agreement which ensured equal rights in marriage.<br>
<br>Billington-Greig's theory was refined during 1906&#150;7 in a series of articles, pamphlets, and speeches for which her notes survive. She developed a distinctive demand for full sexual equality, rejecting bad tactics even for good ends and attacking misogyny in social relations. She rejected the psychological disability which society created in women as well, seeking &#145;emancipation from all shackles of law and custom, from all chains of sentiment and superstition, from all outer imposed disabilities and cherished inner bondages which unite to shut off liberty from the human soul borne in her body&#146;  (<span class="italic">Non-Violent Militant</span>, 137). In December 1907 she debated with Margaret Bondfield (a leading Labour Party activist and trade unionist) about whether women formed a sex class: &#145;The quicker you give women the power to care for women's interests, the quicker all women will have redress&#146; (<span class="italic">Sex Equality versus Adult Suffrage</span>, Manchester Women's Freedom League, 1908; Holton, 58).<br>
<br>Throughout her life Billington-Greig found it difficult to work collaboratively, and she fell out with the Pankhurst leaders of the WSPU in 1907. With Edith How-Martyn and Charlotte Despard she formed the Women's Freedom League, which continued to protest against the &#145;man-made laws&#146; that oppressed women. A particularly imaginative strategy was the refusal to participate in the census of 1911, and generally their tactics stressed non-co-operation rather than aggressive demonstration or courting arrest. In her &#145;The militant suffrage movement&#146; (first published in <span class="italic">The New Age</span>) she rejected the emphasis on the vote, in &#145;Feminism and politics&#146; in favour of a feminism which would &#145;remake society, would set up new standards, would destroy old customs, would establish a new morality&#146;  (<span class="italic">Non-Violent Militant</span>, 227).<br>
<br>In December 1910 Billington-Greig left the Women's Freedom League and retired from direct action, becoming a critic and historian of the suffrage agitation. She retained a belief in the efficacy of passive resistance, as a superior tactic which could include women of all classes, over demonstration, hunger striking, and arson. She spent the next three years as a freelance journalist and speaker. In 1913 she wrote against the 1912 <span class="roman">White Slave Act</span> and feminist emphases on social purity for women; in 1914 she demonstrated yet further estrangement from the mainstream of suffragism by writing in favour of birth control. After a brief marital separation in winter 1913&#150;14 she returned to Glasgow and gave birth to her daughter Fiona in December 1915. During the war and again in 1923 she spent some time substituting for her husband at the billiard works, an interest which was later to lead her to create the Women's Billiards Association and the sports fellowship which would enable poor girls to take part in athletics. Feminism remained important to her, and she managed to earn money briefly as paid organizer for the Business and Professional Women's Club in 1936.<br>
<br>In 1937 Billington-Greig re-entered the Women's Freedom League and turned it into Women for Westminster in 1945; she carried out a merger with the National Women Citizens' Association in 1948, representing women's organizations on various official bodies. She clearly now believed that political participation could bring about the systematic cultural change for which she yearned. She believed herself a failure when in later life she could not find a publisher for a life of Charlotte Despard, leader of the Women's Freedom League, and had little writing published after 1911. Her draft autobiography was never completed. Her husband died in 1961, and she died of cancer at the South London Hospital for Women on 21 October 1964. She had retained her feminist principles throughout. While believing that the unity of all women through their womanly activities, above all as consumers, was the way forward, she never ceased to believe in the power of women through independent organization to make cultural change. Her collected writings might have been better described as the title of her last major publication, in 1912, <span class="italic">The Consumer in Revolt</span>, and she herself as in her own critique of direct action, &#145;a feminist, a suffragist, and a rebel&#146;. Despite her own sense of frustration and failure, she has inspired substantial critical commentary.<br>
