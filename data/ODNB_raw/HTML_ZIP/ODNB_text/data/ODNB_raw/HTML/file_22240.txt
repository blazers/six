<span class="headword">Pierson,  William Henry</span>  (1839&#150;1881), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Le Havre, France, on 23 November 1839, the eldest son of Charles Pierson of Cheltenham and his wife, Louisa Amelia, daughter of William Davidson of Le Havre. He was educated at Southampton and at Cheltenham College (1853&#150;6), of which he was head boy. In 1856 he won the gold medal of the British Association; because of this, Captain Eastwick, a director of the East India Company, without knowing him, gave him a nomination for Addiscombe College, where he gained the Pollock medal and six prizes. He obtained his commission in three terms (1857&#150;8), competing against four-term men, was first in mathematics, and was gazetted lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers from 10 December 1858. The lieutenant-governor, Major-General Sir F. Abbott, described him as &#145;the most talented scholar I have seen at Addiscombe, and his modesty would disarm envy itself&#146;. At Chatham, where he did the usual professional course, he studied German privately, and was an admirable chess player, musician (on piano, cornet, and concertina), and oarsman.<br>
<br>Pierson went to India in October 1860, and soon went on active service with the Sikkim field force; from January to May 1861 he did such good engineering work in bridging the Teesta and Riman rivers, under great local difficulties, that he was three times mentioned in dispatches, and received the thanks of the viceroy. After returning from Sikkim, he joined the public works department in Oudh, where his successful construction of the Fyzabad Road gained him promotion in the department. He was fond of sport, and while in Oudh was noted for his skill in pig-sticking.<br>
<br>When the Indo-European telegraph was begun in 1863, Pierson was selected for employment under Colonel Patrick Stewart. In the winter of 1863&#150;4 he served at Baghdad under Colonel Bateman-Champain, who placed him in charge of 220 miles of line, from Baghdad to Kangawar. His work was very arduous. Bateman-Champain recorded that the eventual success of the telegraph was chiefly due to Pierson's indefatigable exertions, and to his personal influence with the Persian authorities and the Kurdish chiefs of the area. In 1866 Pierson was sent on telegraph duty to the Caucasus, and on his return march narrowly escaped being murdered by a dozen disbanded Persian soldiers. After a short leave in England he acted at Vienna as secretary to the British representative at the International Telegraph Conference of 1868. He was then placed at the disposal of the Foreign Office to design and construct the new residence of the British legation at Tehran. The building demonstrated both his taste as an architect and his skill as an engineer. He was promoted captain on 14 January 1871. He married, at Hollingbourn, Kent, in August 1869, Laura Charlotte, youngest daughter of Richard Thomas, nephew and heir of Richard Thomas of Carmarthenshire, and of Eyhorne, Kent. They had no children.<br>
<br>Pierson was director of the Persian telegraph from October 1871 to October 1873, and his reports and administration repeatedly evoked the special thanks of the government of India. During the 1871 famine he worked, in addition, with desperate energy to relieve the starving population in Persia, a duty for which he was well fitted by his thorough knowledge of the country and its language. He also designed, at the shah's request, some beautiful plans for public offices in Jekran, sketching and working out every detail himself.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1874, Pierson applied himself to the question of harbour defences and armour-plating, and studied at Chatham, acting for a time as instructor in field works. He left Chatham the following year, and until his return to India from furlough in November 1876 devoted himself to music and painting. In July 1877 he was appointed secretary to the Indian defence committee, and was the moving spirit in the consideration of the proposed defences for the Indian ports of Aden, Karachi, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, and Rangoon. During the Afghan campaigns of 1878&#150;81 Pierson's services were several times applied for by the military authorities, in one case by General Sir Frederick Roberts. He was actually appointed assistant adjutant-general Royal Engineers with the Kabul force, but could not be spared from his post on the Indian defence committee. In September 1880 he was appointed military secretary to Lord Ripon, the viceroy, in succession to Sir George White (afterwards commander-in-chief in India and field marshal). Pierson mastered the work, and the viceroy publicly thanked him on the occasion of his winning prizes for painting at the Simla Fine Arts Exhibition in 1880.<br>
<br>Pierson was promoted regimental major on 25 November 1880, and in March 1881 was appointed commanding royal engineer of the field force proceeding against the Mahsud Wazirs. He joined the expedition in weak health, but in high spirits at the prospect of command on active service, to which he had long looked forward. Throughout the expedition the Royal Engineers were much exposed, in road-making, mining, and other arduous duties, to the great heat; on returning to Bannu, Pierson fell ill with dysentery. He died on 2 June 1881, and was buried in Bannu. His wife survived him. Pierson was commemorated by the Royal Engineers in the Afghan memorial in Rochester Cathedral, and by a marble tablet, with a medallion of his head, in Cheltenham College chapel.<br>
