<span class="headword">Thomas,  Honoratus Leigh</span>  (1769&#150;1846), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, the son of John Thomas of Hawarden, Flintshire, and his wife, Maria, sister of John Boydell, was born on 26 March 1769. On arriving in London as a young man he presented a letter of introduction to the eminent surgeon John Hunter. Hunter made an appointment with Thomas for 5 a.m. the following morning, at which time Thomas found Hunter busily engaged dissecting insects. Thomas was appointed dresser to Hunter at St George's Hospital and he also became a pupil of the anatomist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6846/', "William Cumberland Cruikshank (1745&#150;1800)")</script>. He obtained the diploma of the Company of Surgeons on 16 October 1794, was an original member of the Royal College of Surgeons on its incorporation in 1800, and was elected to the fellowship on its foundation in 1843.<br>
<br>Thomas's early professional work was in the army and navy. He passed as first mate, third rate (navy), on 5 July 1792, and, on the recommendation of Hunter, was appointed assistant surgeon to Lord Macartney's embassy to China in the same year. In 1799 he volunteered for medical service with the duke of York's army in the Netherlands. On the surrender of the forces to the French enemy Thomas wished to remain with the wounded, who could not be moved. He was told that he could only stay as a prisoner, and he decided to remain in that capacity. As soon as his services could be dispensed with, however, he was allowed to return home.<br>
<br>On 10 September 1795 Thomas had married Cruikshank's elder daughter; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27214/', "Edward Thomas (1813&#150;1886)")</script> was their son. In 1800 Thomas succeeded to his father-in-law's practice in Leicester Place, where he afterwards lived for nearly fifty years. Notwithstanding his position at the Royal College of Surgeons, Thomas seems rather to have avoided surgery and was generally called in for consultation in medical cases. According to J. F. Clarke, Thomas was a poor surgeon but was a shrewd practitioner in medical cases, to which his practice was mainly limited. He also wrote that &#145;personally he was the beau ideal of a physician&#146; and that &#145;he had a very extensive practice among licensed victuallers&#146;  (Cope, 58).<br>
<br>At the Royal College of Surgeons, Thomas was a member of the court of assistants from 1818 to 1845, examiner from 1818 to 1845, vice-president in 1827, 1828, 1836, and 1837, and president in 1829 and 1838. In 1827 he delivered the Hunterian oration. In this oration there are some interesting personal reminiscences of Hunter. Thomas was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 16 January 1806. He was also a member of the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg. In addition to his Hunterian oration he published &#145;Description of an hermaphrodite lamb&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Medical and Physical Journal</span>, 1799), &#145;Anatomical description of a male rhinoceros&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 1801), &#145;Case of artificial dilatation of the female urethra&#146;  (<span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, 1809), and &#145;Case of obstruction in the large intestines occasioned by a biliary calculus of extraordinary size&#146;  (ibid., 1845). Thomas died at Belmont, Torquay, on 26 June 1846.<br>
