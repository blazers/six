<span class="headword">Boyd,  William</span>, fourth earl of Kilmarnock  (1705&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, the son and heir of William Boyd, third earl of Kilmarnock (1683/4&#150;1717), and his wife, Euphemia (<i>b</i>. 1684, <i>d</i>. in or before 1729), daughter of William, eleventh Lord Ross, was born on 12 May 1705 and baptized twelve days later at Kilmarnock. Styled Lord Boyd until succeeding his father in September 1717, he was educated at Glasgow University. During the 1715 Jacobite rising the third earl, a country whig by political background, raised a regiment in support of the government and the young Lord Boyd accompanied him on campaign.<br>
<br>Kilmarnock inherited an encumbered estate, and his straitened circumstances were made worse by what he later confessed was a &#145;careless and dissolute life&#146; marked by &#145;vanity, and addictedness to impurity and sensual pleasure&#146;  (Foster, 10&#150;11). In politics he long followed the lead of Sir Robert Walpole and the Campbells. He was a regular voter in peers' elections, invariably supporting the ministry's candidates. In the hotly contested election of 1734, opposition peers noted that he had been brought from France at government expense, and that he and his wife each received pensions of &pound;200.<br>
<br>It is as a Jacobite, however, that Kilmarnock is best known. After Walpole's fall his pension was stopped, and he was drawn to the Stuart cause mainly because he saw it as an opportunity to retrieve his broken fortune. He later told the duke of Argyll:<blockquote>for the two Kings and their rights, I cared not a farthing which prevailed; but I was starving, and, by God, if Mahommed had set up his standard in the Highlands I had been a good Mussulman for bread, and stuck close to the party, for I must eat. (Lenman, 256&#150;7)</blockquote>A likely contributing factor was the Jacobite leanings of his in-laws. On 15 June 1724 Kilmarnock, a lifelong member of the Church of Scotland, had married Lady Anne Livingston (<i>bap</i>. 1709, <i>d</i>. 1747), an episcopalian, whose father, James, fifth earl of Linlithgow and fourth earl of Callendar, had been attainted for his participation in the 'Fifteen. Through her maternal aunt, Lady Kilmarnock was also the presumptive heir of the countess of Erroll. A rumour circulated that the latter had threatened to disinherit the Kilmarnocks if the earl did not come out for the Young Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart.<br>
<br>Kilmarnock had no part in planning the rising of 1745 and joined the Jacobites only in October, after Charles Edward had visited Callendar House, near Falkirk, part of his wife's inheritance. One of the few lowland peers to join the rising, Kilmarnock wrote to his wife that &#145;I am now in my Boots to join the Prince&#146; and that &#145;every Scotsman in his senses will go the same way&#146;  (Bailey, 25&#150;6). He quickly became prominent in the Jacobite leadership and was named to the privy council. In the internal politics of the movement, he generally followed the prince's lead. He commanded a troop of Horse Guards on the march into England and later distinguished himself at the battle of Falkirk (17 January 1746), where his knowledge of local topography proved useful. (On the same occasion, Lady Kilmarnock was said to have contributed to the Jacobite victory by entertaining Henry Hawley, commander of the government army, with a leisurely breakfast at Callendar House, delaying his reaction to the Jacobite attack.) At the battle of Culloden (16 April 1746) Kilmarnock's troop formed part of the Jacobite reserve and fought dismounted. He was captured when, in the closing stages of the battle, he mistook royal dragoons for a Jacobite regiment.<br>
<br>Originally imprisoned at Inverness, Kilmarnock was later brought to London, where in late July he was tried for high treason in the House of Lords along with the earl of Cromarty and Lord Balmerino. Kilmarnock pleaded guilty and repented of his part in the rising. At the trial Horace Walpole noted that he looked younger than his forty-one years, &#145;tall and slender, with an extreme fine person&#146;, and that he behaved with &#145;a most just mixture between dignity and submission&#146;  (Walpole to Sir Horace Mann, 1 Aug 1746, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 19.281). Though he won much sympathy, Kilmarnock and the other Jacobite lords were convicted and condemned to death. He still hoped for mercy, and the duke of Hamilton, Lady Townshend, and others pleaded for his life. Only Cromarty was pardoned, however, and Kilmarnock and Balmerino were beheaded on 18 August 1746 on Tower Hill. Kilmarnock, dressed in black, met his end bravely and acknowledged in a final statement that his was a just punishment. Though he and Balmerino parted as friends, the latter remained defiantly Jacobite and went to the block protesting his loyalty to the Stuarts.<br>
<br>The topic of their last conversation&#151;whether, on the eve of Culloden, Jacobite orders had specified that no quarter be given government troops&#151;became and has remained a subject of controversy. Though both men denied knowledge of such an order, Kilmarnock acknowledged that while a prisoner at Inverness he had heard that the duke of Cumberland had in his possession a no-quarter order signed by Lord George Murray, the Jacobite general. Some felt that Cumberland suspected Kilmarnock's complicity in the alleged no-quarter decision and that this had doomed his plea for mercy. (None of the surviving copies of the order in Murray's hand includes the no-quarter phrase, and doubts exist about the authenticity of the order that came into Cumberland's hands.)<br>
<br>Attainted, Kilmarnock's titles and estates were forfeited at his death. His eldest son, James, Lord Boyd, who had fought on the government side at Culloden, successfully regained them through litigation in 1751; in 1758 he inherited the earldom of Erroll from his great-aunt. Kilmarnock, whose head was reunited with his body in the coffin and not displayed, was buried on the day of his execution in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower.<br>
<br>The highest-ranking peer to be executed for participation in the 'Forty-Five, Kilmarnock's dramatic death was easily the most memorable feature of his career. In repudiating his actions in the rising he played the part expected of the condemned in the eighteenth century, though Balmerino's defiance made the latter the preferred hero in Jacobite tradition.<br>
