<span class="headword">Davidson,  John</span>  (1797&#150;1836), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, the son of an opulent tailor and army clothier in Cork Street, London, originally from Kelso, Roxburghshire, was born on 23 December 1797. He was educated at a private academy near London, and in 1814 was apprenticed to Savory and Moore, chemists and druggists, a firm in which he ultimately purchased a partnership. Later he became a pupil at St George's Hospital, and entered the University of Edinburgh with the intention of becoming a doctor. His health failed, however, and he gave up the study of medicine to travel. He went first to Naples in 1827 and thence through much of central Europe. He went to Egypt at the end of 1829, visited the pyramids, and passed overland to Quseir on the Red Sea coast where he embarked for India on his way to China and Persia. An attack of cholera, however, drove him back to Quseir. He made an excursion through Arabia, and visited Palestine, Syria, the Greek Isles, Athens, and Constantinople, collecting much geographical information, which he afterwards communicated in papers read at the meetings of the Royal Society and the Royal Institution of London. In 1831 he went to America, travelling in the United States, and in Spanish America where he visited and surveyed the pyramids of Choluteca; he then settled down for a time to the study of Egyptology. On 13 July 1833 he delivered an address on embalming at the Royal Institution, when he unrolled a mummy in the presence of a deeply interested audience; he later published a pamphlet describing the occasion. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1835. His craving for travel was, however, irresistible. He decided to explore in Africa, planning to go by way of Fez and, after examining the southern slopes of the Atlas Mountains, to Nigritia and across the Sahara to Timbuktu. He left England in September 1835, accompanied only by a black companion, Edward Donnelan or Ab&uacute; Bekr. From Gibraltar he crossed the straits into Morocco, where his medical knowledge was so highly valued by the sultan that he had great difficulty in obtaining permission to depart. He estimated that he treated twelve hundred patients in Morocco, and he also gave instruction to local physicians. When leaving he was obliged to plead that his stock of medicine was exhausted, and at his request a medicine chest was forwarded to the sultan from England. He started for the Sahara at the end of November 1836 after numerous delays, but while stopping at a watering-place called Swekeza he was robbed and murdered on 17 or 18 December 1836 by a party from the tribe El Harib, who are thought to have been bribed by the merchants of Tafilelt to seize the traveller and his goods. The findings of his travels were recorded in letters, published later in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> (1836 and 1837). After Davidson's death his brother printed privately a book of pathetic interest entitled <span class="italic">Notes Taken during Travels in Africa</span> (1839).<br>
