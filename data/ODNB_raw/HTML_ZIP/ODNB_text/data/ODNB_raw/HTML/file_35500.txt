<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  Henry Charles Keith  Petty-</span>, fifth marquess of Lansdowne  (1845&#150;1927), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Lansdowne House, Berkeley Square, London, on 14 January 1845, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22072/', "Henry Thomas Petty-Fitzmaurice, fourth marquess of Lansdowne (1816&#150;1866)")</script>, politician and landowner, and his second wife, Emily Jane Mercer Elphinstone de Flahault, Lady Nairne (1819&#150;1895), daughter of Auguste Charles Joseph, Count de Flahault de la Billardrie, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8751/', "Margaret de Flahault de la Billardrie, Lady Nairne and Baroness Keith")</script>. He was known as Viscount Clanmaurice until the death of his grandfather (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22071/', "Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, the third marquess")</script>) in 1863, and as the earl of Kerry until the death of his father in 1866. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35499/', "Lord Edmond George Petty-Fitzmaurice (1846&#150;1935)")</script> was his younger brother. Grandson of the third marquess of Lansdowne, a prominent whig leader for more than fifty years, and great-grandson of Lord Shelburne, one of George III's prime ministers, Clanmaurice was destined from birth to inherit one of the foremost whig titles, endowed with great estates in England, Scotland, and Ireland. His education was a careful preparation for public affairs. After a preparatory school at Woodcote, near Reading, he proceeded to Eton College, where he was fag master to Arthur James Balfour, who was three years his junior and who as tory leader was to be his closest political associate in later life. In his mid-teens his father withdrew him from Eton, where he had fallen in with the boating set, and sent him to a private tutor (the Revd Lewis Campbell), who was given instructions to prepare him for Balliol rather than the more customary Christ Church.<br>
<br>On the sudden death of his father in 1866, while still an undergraduate Lansdowne succeeded to the marquessate and family estates. At Balliol he spent successive long vacations with Jowett, his tutor and soon to be master, who delighted to exercise his influence on young men of position and characteristically advised him that &#145;wealth and rank are means and not ends, and may be the greatest evil or the greatest good as they are used&#146;  (Newton, 7). In later years Lansdowne was wont to remark that but for Jowett he would have done little with his life. After a typical aristocratic student life in which sport featured largely, he worked hard for Greats, although he missed a first. He showed little interest in politics at Oxford, but his subsequent career&#151;beyond that of <i>grand seigneur</i>&#151;was never in doubt. &#145;A new era of politics is beginning and unless a man would be a cipher or a paradox he should fit himself for it&#146;, was Jowett's parting advice  (ibid., 9).<br>
<br>On 8 November 1869, shortly after graduation, Lansdowne married Lady Maud Evelyn Hamilton (1850&#150;1932), younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12098/', "James Hamilton, the first duke of Abercorn")</script>. As a whig, Lansdowne took his seat on the Liberal benches in the House of Lords as a matter of course. Neither Gladstone nor Granville, the Liberal leader in the upper house, was slow to nurture young aristocratic promise. Lansdowne was appointed a junior whip in Gladstone's first government (1869), promoted to under-secretary for war three years later, and made under-secretary for India at the start of Gladstone's second government (1880). However, he shared the growing whig disillusion with the Liberal leader, and in 1880 resigned his ministerial office after only two months over the <span class="roman">Irish Compensation for Disturbance Bill</span>, the prelude to the sweeping <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> of the following year. Lansdowne told Gladstone that his opposition to the interference with property rights, and his &#145;position as an Irish landlord&#146;  (Newton, 19), made the break unavoidable.<br>
<br>It was the first notable step of a career in which the defence of the landowning class against a perceived threat from the left was to be a principal theme. Lansdowne was far from an unthinking reactionary, but his standing as one of the largest Anglo-Irish landlords, with a prominent political position, made him a foremost target for the anti-landlord movement in England and Ireland throughout his life. With the aristocracy still firmly entrenched at Westminster, it did nothing to impede his early career.<h2>
<a name="ImperialgovernorandSalisburysprotg18831900"></a>Imperial governor and Salisbury's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, 1883&#150;1900</h2>Lansdowne did not immediately leave the Liberal Party after his resignation. In 1883 he accepted Gladstone's offer to go to Canada as governor-general, from whence, in 1888, he proceeded almost directly to India as viceroy at the invitation of Lord Salisbury; he remained in Calcutta until 1894. As a youngish great magnate with administrative capacity, a suitable consort, and <i>persona grata</i> to both political parties, Lansdowne was an obvious choice for the two most senior viceregal offices in the empire. Until the First World War both posts were normally held by aristocrats of grand title and Lansdowne was one of several peers in the period to hold the two in succession, with Canada&#151;a self-governing white colony&#151;regarded as an apprenticeship for the more arduous duties of India. Although money played a part in his decision to go abroad, politics was more important. Imperial service enabled Lansdowne, a whig with increasingly tory sympathies, to avoid the bitter internecine strife engulfing the Liberal Party, while building credit with both parties and acquiring high-level imperial experience and expertise at a time when they were useful assets for a political career at home. As he put it to his mother on accepting India, &#145;I shall only be doing what all those have to do who are soldiers or sailors or diplomatists, and who have to take their turn of service abroad as an inevitable incident of their profession&#146;  (Newton, 51).<br>
<br>Lansdowne's qualities of tact and reliability, fortified by little imagination and no ambition to seize the reins from ministers at home, served him well in his viceregal postings. Sir John Alexander Macdonald was secure in the Canadian premiership during his period of office. Most of Lansdowne's time was devoted to travelling, to Canada's external policy (notably the long-running dispute with the United States over the delimitation of the Newfoundland fisheries), and to social duties, where his fluent French was an advantage. In India the pressures were far greater. The dominant concerns of British rulers of the period were domestic unrest&#151;without, as yet, an organized nationalist dimension&#151;and the security of the raj from Russian advances from the north. Unlike Lytton before or Curzon after, Lansdowne managed an active defence of imperial interests without arousing controversy at home through an avowed &#145;forward&#146; policy or divisions within his government. He worked in harmony with Sir Frederick Roberts, the commander-in-chief. Friction developed with Gladstone's Liberal government in 1892 over a proposed military mission to Afghanistan, but a compromise was reached. Lansdowne remained and Roberts was recalled to London, in marked contrast to the resolution of the crisis between Curzon, Kitchener, and the home government a decade later.<br>
<br>On returning to London in 1894, during the short-lived Gladstone&#150;Rosebery government, Lansdowne confirmed himself in Salisbury's confidence and a year later was made war secretary (1895&#150;1900) in the succeeding Unionist administration. Nominally a Liberal Unionist, he was soon regarded as Salisbury's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Balfour was heir apparent to the premiership, but it came as little surprise when, after the 1900 election, Lansdowne succeeded the ageing premier at the Foreign Office, and later&#151;after a brief tenure by the duke of Devonshire&#151;as Unionist leader in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Most of Lansdowne's efforts at the War Office were devoted to carrying through the reorganization recommended by the Hartington commission in 1890, which subordinated the commander-in-chief to the war secretary. But the conduct of the South African War, which began in October 1899, was his most trying assignment. Although the errors of the early campaigns may be largely attributed to misjudgements by Sir Redvers Buller, the commander-in-chief, Lansdowne attracted widespread public criticism, even after Buller's supersession by Roberts in January 1900 and the turning of the military tide. Yet much of the indictment was shared by the rest of the cabinet&#151;particularly the prime minister&#151;and it did nothing to thwart his promotion to the Foreign Office after Salisbury's landslide victory in the &#145;khaki election&#146; of November 1900.<h2>
<a name="Foreignsecretary19001905"></a>Foreign secretary, 1900&#150;1905</h2>It was as foreign secretary for the next five years, and as leader of the Unionist peers in the fierce conflicts between the Lords and the pre-war Liberal governments of Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith, that Lansdowne left two of his three signal marks on early twentieth-century politics. The third, and perhaps most enduring, was his peace initiative of 1916&#150;17.<br>
<br>As foreign secretary, Lansdowne precipitated Britain's engagement with the system of continental alliances which was to culminate in the First World War. Salisbury's policy, misleadingly termed &#145;splendid isolation&#146;, involved co-operation with continental powers, particularly on imperial disputes, but stopped short of treaty commitments placing Britain in one or other of the emerging continental blocs. By the end of the South African War, an event which heightened fears for British imperial security, this policy of co-operation without alliances was increasingly seen as unsustainable in the face of rapidly growing continental naval forces and increasingly formalized imperial rivalries. In this context, the decision to ally with France and Russia was not especially surprising. Britain's imperial interests were most immediately affected by those two powers: Lansdowne had experienced at first hand the tension with Russia in Asia, and the decision of the Liberal government of 1892&#150;5&#151;sustained by Salisbury after 1895&#151;to retain Britain's interest in Egypt made a settlement of rivalries with France a matter of pressing concern to many imperial authorities. Historians have traced this &#145;new course&#146; in British foreign policy back to the Liberal government of 1892&#150;5, although they have also highlighted its uncertainties and contradictions  (Penson, 136&#150;8).<br>
<br>Lansdowne gave an impetus to this new course, and by the time he left the Foreign Office it was wellnigh irreversible. But it was far from a preconceived grand plan, or indeed a plan of any kind until Salisbury retired from the premiership. On the contrary, Lansdowne's first initiative was a rapprochement with Germany. Exploiting the goodwill created by Wilhelm's visit to Victoria in her final illness, he opened discussions in early 1901 and by May a draft convention had been framed. However, neither side was prepared to make a further advance. Facing a persistently anti-English press and public opinion, Count Bulow prevaricated, while Salisbury remained unpersuaded of the virtue of the implied commitment to support Germany and Austria against Russia. For similar reasons the collapse of the German talks did not lead to any immediate overture to France, with whom relations had remained tense since the Fashoda crisis, or with Russia, by now France's ally. Lansdowne sought instead to safeguard British interests in the Far East by improving relations with Japan, leading to the Anglo-Japanese treaty of 30 January 1902.<br>
<br>Salisbury's retirement did not lead to an immediate change of policy. But it allowed Lansdowne greater latitude in Europe, and as relations improved with France during 1903 the underlying forces for more formal Anglo-French co-operation asserted themselves. A conducive atmosphere was created by the celebrated visit of Edward VII to Paris in May 1903 and the return visit by President Loubet two months later, although the king took no part in the actual negotiations. Talks continued throughout the latter months of 1903, turning on a mutually advantageous trade-off between the recognition of British claims in Egypt and of French claims in Morocco.<br>
<br>The <i>entente cordiale</i> was signed on 7 April 1904, and stands as Lansdowne's greatest act as foreign secretary. In form it was a settlement of colonial tensions; but even at the time its significance in signalling Britain's engagement in the continental alliance system was clear enough. A growing hostility between Britain and Germany, unchecked by its diplomats, became apparent at every level. Under Sir Edward Grey, Lansdowne's successor and a fellow whig imperialist, the policy of the entente was taken forward through military talks with France and the 1907 Anglo-Russian entente.<h2>
<a name="LeaderoftheUnionistpeers19031916"></a>Leader of the Unionist peers, 1903&#150;1916</h2>Although responsible for leading the House of Lords in the last two years of Balfour's government, Lansdowne took no prominent part in domestic politics until the 1906 election. He largely abstained from the tariff reform controversy which engulfed the Unionist alliance after Chamberlain's pro-tariff Birmingham speech of May 1903, being content to follow Balfour's lead&#151;however indecisive&#151;on that as on most other issues.<br>
<br>The 1906 Liberal landslide forced Lansdowne to prominence in one of the bitterest periods of party strife in modern British history. As leader of the Unionist peers, commanding virtually the entire membership of the upper house in opposition to a radical and determined Liberal government, he faced a challenge as great as that confronting the duke of Wellington in the 1830s and Lord Salisbury in the 1880s. The legislative power of the Lords was still, in law, equal to that of the Commons, yet it had to be exercised with extreme discretion if it was to strengthen, not weaken, the Unionists and the landed interest. Opposing Gladstone's last three governments, Salisbury had a shrewd strategic sense for when the Lords should refrain from asserting itself, while satisfying his supporters with defiant rhetoric and a powerful popular presence. Lansdowne had little of the strategic sense and none of the defiance or popular touch. One long-standing colleague (Selborne) remarked in retirement that he was &#145;the most perfect gentleman in the world, of great experience, ability and good sense; but ridiculously diffident, and a nature too cautious, almost timid &hellip; he has some vision, but little initiative, and no driving power&#146;  (Adonis, 33). The later peace letter revealed Lansdowne to be far from devoid of vision or initiative, but he was at his weakest in domestic politics. As leader of the Unionist peers, his natural diffidence was exacerbated by subordination to Balfour's direction, when Balfour's leadership was itself vacillating and increasingly mistrusted by his more ardent followers in both houses. This served to encourage extremism among the peers, a hard core of whom&#151;particularly the less wealthy Irish landowners who felt betrayed by the previous Unionist government&#151;already shared a &#145;die-hard&#146; mentality and were goaded to feckless resistance by the fiery rhetoric of Lloyd George, which met no match on their own front bench.<br>
<br>Conflict between the two houses commenced immediately after the election, but for the first three sessions of the parliament Lansdowne was able to exploit the fact that much of the government's legislation was designed to appease its nonconformist Liberal activists and aroused little popular passion. The mauling of the 1906 <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> (to limit the power of the established church in schools), and the rejection of the 1907 <span class="roman">Licensing Bill</span> (to strengthen the liquor licensing regime), did the peers no harm in the country, while Lansdowne tactfully allowed the 1906 <span class="roman">Trades Disputes Bill</span> (giving unions legal immunity in industrial disputes) to pass unscathed. Although condemning the latter as &#145;dangerous&#146;, he warned the peers: &#145;It is useless for us, situated as we are, to oppose this measure&#146;  (Adonis, 141). A number of land reforms relating to Ireland and the extension of smallholdings were allowed through the Lords on the same principle.<br>
<br>The 1908 session marked the watershed. In April Asquith succeeded Campbell-Bannerman, with Lloyd George moving to the exchequer and Churchill to the Board of Trade. A string of by-election defeats attested to the government's waning popularity, and its Labour allies grew increasingly restive. These factors pushed the Liberals decisively down the road of social reform to appeal to the Labour vote; and for a government committed to free trade and anxious to take on the Lords, the cost of state pensions for the indigent elderly, plus the bill for the accelerating armaments programme vociferously demanded by the Unionists, had to be met partly by heavier taxes on the wealthy. Hence Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146; of 1909. In reality the new taxes were fairly moderate and the workers suffered from a sharp rise in excise duties, but the wealthy classes supporting the Unionists&#151;not just the peers&#151;saw the new &#145;super tax&#146; and land duties as the thin end of a socialistic wedge. Moreover, the campaign against the budget had months to gather momentum, as it moved slowly through the Commons, harried clause by clause, during the summer and autumn of 1909. Lloyd George's provocative speeches, culminating in his famous Limehouse tirade of 30 July, turned Unionist back-bench opinion frenzied, and support for rejection of the budget, an unthinkable act even six months previously, became almost uncontrollable in the Lords.<br>
<br>Lansdowne did nothing to control the frenzy; nor did Balfour, which was probably the critical factor. Sharing the landowners' fears which gave rise to the anti-budget campaign, and anxious to force an early election which they hoped would weaken or possibly even eradicate Asquith's majority, they drifted inexorably towards rejection. Lansdowne was acutely aware of the struggle that would have been entailed by a decision <i>not</i> to reject. In 1908 he had to exert himself to restrain disgruntled Irish peers from rejecting the <span class="roman">Irish Evicted Tenants Bill</span>; he also allowed the peers to pass a series of amendments to that year's budget&#151;which raised Unionist hackles by equalizing tax rates on earned and unearned income&#151;only to be forced to retreat after Balfour conceded in the Commons that they were a breach of privilege. In July 1909 he only narrowly averted the passage of Roberts's bill for compulsory military service, and in October, a month before the arrival of the budget, faced another rebellion by the Irish peers on that year's <span class="roman">Land Bill</span>. By then Lansdowne had all but committed himself to opposing the budget. In a private letter in early October, he noted &#145;the general feeling&#146; of the peers &#145;decidedly in favour&#146; of rejecting the budget, and declared, almost fatalistically: &#145;I do not see how the House of Lords could ever intervene usefully in the future if it accepts a deliberate slap in the face now&#146;  (Adonis, 153).<br>
<br>Lansdowne moved the rejection of the budget on 22 November, and after six days of debate which exhibited, more than anything, the peers' loathing of the proposed property and capital taxes, it was rejected by 350 votes to 75. The Liberals triumphed in the ensuing election (January 1910). Although henceforth dependent on Labour and Irish nationalist support, Asquith had a Commons majority of more than 100 with them, and those parties were, if anything, still more anxious than the Liberals to curb the Lords' veto. The budget was immediately reintroduced, and passed the Lords unopposed. It was swiftly followed by a <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> to limit the veto to two years and abolish it altogether in the case of money bills. The death of Edward VII brought a temporary halt to hostilities: both sides agreed to a constitutional conference to consider a compromise. This was the last best chance for Balfour and Lansdowne to salvage their position, perhaps by securing agreement to referendums for the passage of significant constitutional changes opposed by the Lords. But they refused to countenance an agreement involving abolition of the Lords' veto over &#145;penal&#146; taxation. Asquith, meanwhile, had secured a commitment from George V&#151;as yet unpublished&#151;to create sufficient Liberal peers to carry the bill should the peers reject it after another election.<br>
<br>The December 1910 election repeated the verdict of the January poll, and unleashed a year of internecine strife within the Unionist Party. The peers began by amending the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> out of all recognition. In mid-July 1911 Asquith secured the king's consent to publish his earlier promise, and wrote to Lansdowne and Balfour (20 July) to warn that further resistance by the Lords would be followed by a creation of Liberal peers sufficient &#145;to secure the passing of the bill into law&#146;  (Newton, 420). At this critical juncture Lansdowne, following Balfour's example, all but abdicated his leadership. At a shadow cabinet meeting on 21 July Balfour mystified colleagues as to his own position; while at a meeting of Unionist peers immediately afterwards Lansdowne announced that he would abstain in the forthcoming Lords votes on the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span>, and did nothing more decisive than leave an impression that he favoured prudence. The Unionist peers promptly split between the &#145;die-hards&#146; and a hastily convened group of &#145;hedgers&#146; prepared to see the bill pass to prevent a mass creation of Liberal peers. Lansdowne's weakness was exemplified by the defection of his two whips, and much of his front bench, to the die-hards. He took little part in the final Lords debates on 9 and 10 August 1911, beyond tacitly encouraging Curzon&#151;prime organizer of the hedgers&#151;to allow some Unionists to vote with the Liberals to ensure the defeat of the die-hards. Immediately after the narrow passage of the bill Lansdowne left for his Irish estate. &#145;I have had a luckless session of it&#146;, he wrote to Balfour  (Adonis, 35).<br>
<br>Although it was widely expected that he would resign with Balfour in the autumn, Lansdowne remained Unionist leader in the Lords under Bonar Law, and presided over another three years of bitter conflict between the two houses&#151;notably over the <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span>, which the Lords managed to delay until 1914, when the war prevented its implementation.<h2>
<a name="Thepeaceletter1917"></a>The peace letter, 1917</h2>Lansdowne strongly supported the decision for war in August 1914. A shadow cabinet meeting in Lansdowne House on the evening of 2 August dispatched a note to Asquith warning that &#145;it would be fatal to the honour and security of the United Kingdom to hesitate in supporting France at the present juncture&#146;, and offering &#145;unhesitating support&#146; for any military action  (Newton, 440). Having thus strengthened the hands of Asquith and Grey within the cabinet, two days later&#151;after the declaration of war&#151;Lansdowne told Haldane that he was &#145;strongly of opinion&#146; that the British expeditionary force should be sent to the continent &#145;at the very outset&#146;  (Newton, 440), committing the Unionists to the ensuing strategy on the western front. Personal tragedy struck early: Lansdowne's second son was killed in France in October. But his commitment to the war did not waver. In May 1915 he took office as minister without portfolio in Asquith's coalition, and in government he supported conscription.<br>
<br>Doubts about the capacity of the allies to score a decisive victory grew on Lansdowne after the catastrophic Somme offensive of June 1916. Five months later, in response to a round robin invitation from Asquith for views as to the course of the war, he submitted a memorandum, dated 13 November 1916, which presaged the peace letter of the following year. It was a remarkably lucid and balanced assessment. Reviewing the military situation, the available resources, and the position of the allies, he concluded that although there was no question of defeat, outright victory was unlikely. He argued for a restatement of war aims that might open the way to a negotiated settlement. Most striking was an emotional appeal as to the scale of the slaughter. Noting that 15,000 British officers had been killed to date out of total allied casualties of more than 1.1 million, he wrote: &#145;We are slowly but surely killing off the best of the male population of these islands. &hellip; Generations will have to come and go before the country recovers from the loss&#146;  (Earl of Oxford and Asquith, 2.138&#150;47).<br>
<br>In his war memoirs Lloyd George claimed the memorandum &#145;startled the Cabinet&#146;  (George, 2.318), and Crewe, perhaps Asquith's closest ministerial confidant, later asserted that it precipitated Lloyd George's bid for power in the following weeks through fear that Lansdowne might gain wider support. In reality, there was no overt support for Lansdowne and Asquith's fall was caused by wider forces, notably the growing appreciation of his incapacity as a war leader. The fact that Asquith wrote a short note to Lansdowne on 28 November expressing his &#145;complete concurrence&#146; with the memorandum was, more than anything, characteristic of his readiness to appease strongly expressed views. Lansdowne's intervention was but one marker in the final disintegration of the Asquith government.<br>
<br>Lansdowne left office on Asquith's resignation. The subsequent German peace note offered little basis for negotiations, yet Lloyd George made no attempt to create an opening even had it been possible. It is therefore unsurprising that, after another massively costly but largely futile assault on the western front at Passchendaele, Lansdowne should have been still more attracted to a negotiated peace. More surprising is that he should have gone public, through his famous peace letter printed in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> on 29 November 1917 (perhaps the result of a misunderstanding of a conversation held in the street with A. J. Balfour). Yet his views were well known in senior reaches of government, and had made no impact. By nature the least populist of politicians, Lansdowne was acutely aware that all the major shifts of opinion during the war had depended upon the media; and as the ministers he consulted&#151;notably Balfour&#151;were averse to a parliamentary debate, he decided on a public letter instead. It was a courageous act, but far from a precipitate one. Indeed, it might have had a greater chance of success&#151;both in mobilizing domestic support and exploiting the military impasse&#151;had it been undertaken at the time of his initial cabinet memorandum, of which the letter was practically a paraphrase.<br>
<br>The letter created a sensation, as much for its emotional tone as for its argument. &#145;We are not going to lose this War&#146;, Lansdowne wrote, &#145;but its prolongation will spell ruin for the civilised world, and an infinite addition to the load of human suffering which already weighs upon it&#146;  (Newton, 467). Denunciation, bitter and personal, followed immediately from the Northcliffe press, and Lansdowne was ostracized by the Unionist leadership in public. But his move was warmly received by the leading provincial press, attracted significant private support in high quarters, and served as a beacon to the peace movement. A Lansdowne committee was formed and addresses presented. &#145;The prevailing note is, &#147;you have had the courage to say what we have been thinking for ever so long&#148;&#146;, he told his daughter of his large mailbag  (Newton, 472). President Wilson's &#145;fourteen points&#146; were widely seen to be on Lansdowne lines, and he pressed on with further letters in March and July, supplemented by Lords speeches, calling for a careful restatement of war aims. Only with the unexpected collapse of Germany in November 1918 did the Lansdowne movement cease.<br>
<br>Lansdowne's initiative almost certainly came too late to open the way to a negotiated peace. Yet its motivation was reasonable to all who could face the reality of the war, and it tapped a broad vein of popular opinion&#151;far broader than its own generation, including many of those who were supportive at the time, were prepared to concede.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandassessment"></a>Last years and assessment</h2>Increasingly infirm, Lansdowne appeared only occasionally in the Lords after the war. The looting and burning of his beloved Irish house at Derreen, co. Kerry, in the autumn of 1922 distressed him greatly, and symbolized the fate of the southern Irish landlord class. With characteristic tenacity he pursued the Irish government for compensation, rebuilt the house, and it was <i>en route</i> to it, at Newtown Anmer House, Clonmel, that he died, of heart failure, on 3 June 1927. He was buried at his ancestral seat of Bowood, and was succeeded as sixth marquess by his elder son. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Lansdowne was a foremost exemplar of the last generation of great magnates to rule in Britain almost by hereditary right. Other hereditary peers&#151;notably Halifax, Home, and Carrington&#151;were to follow in similar footsteps, but they were less grand and more socially isolated in their prominence. Although he never once occupied an elected office, Lansdowne's entire adult life was spent in posts of the highest political responsibility. Little suited to democratic politics, he played a pivotal role&#151;almost in spite of himself&#151;in Edwardian and First World War politics, and by the end of the war was a figure of greater controversy than any of the popular leaders of the age. With its remarkable combination of popular, patrician, and imperial elements, his career graphically symbolized the significant political role played by Britain's old aristocracy until well into the twentieth century.<br>
