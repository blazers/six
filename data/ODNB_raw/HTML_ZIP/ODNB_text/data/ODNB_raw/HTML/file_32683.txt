<span class="headword">Cust,  Henry John Cockayne <span class="st"> [Harry]</span></span>  (1861&#150;1917), <span class="occ">politician and journalist</span>, was born on 10 October 1861 in London, the elder son of Henry Francis Cockayne Cust (1819&#150;1884), Conservative MP for Grantham (1874&#150;80) and a major in the north Salopian yeomanry cavalry, and his wife, Sarah Jane (<i>d</i>. 1867), daughter of Isaac Cookson, of Meldon Park, Northumberland, and widow of Major Sidney Streatfeild. He went to Eton College in 1874, where he was captain of the oppidans, and in 1881 entered Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he was a member of the boat club and of the Magpie and Stump (a light-hearted debating society) and was elected to the Apostles, the exclusive literary society, in 1883. He was elected to a scholarship at Trinity in that year and graduated BA with second-class honours in the classical tripos in 1884. He was admitted to the Inner Temple on 17 August 1888 but was not called. He obtained the <i>baccalaur&eacute;at en droit</i> in Paris but did not practise. Instead, he decided to forgo a legal career and entered parliament in 1890 as Conservative MP for Stamford, Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>Cust was a socialite and a member of the Crabbet Club (1888&#150;94), founded by Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, whose members included George Curzon and George Wyndham. He was also a member of the intellectual and aristocratic coterie called the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42005', "Souls")</script>. The group included some of the most wealthy and powerful men and women of the day, among whom were George Curzon, Margot Tennant (later Lady Asquith), and the politicians Arthur Balfour and George Wyndham. Cust, as a handsome young man, was popular among the set and had numerous affairs, one of which was with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49527/', "Violet Manners (1856&#150;1937)")</script>, wife of Lord Granby. Despite the knowledge of the affair among the Souls, the birth of their daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40701/', "Lady Diana Manners (later Lady Diana Cooper)")</script> in 1892 was not acknowledged until well into the twentieth century. Cust left Violet for an affair with Pamela Wyndham, sister of George Wyndham, but she was sent to India to get over Cust. Cust then seduced Emmeline Mary Elizabeth (Nina) Welby-Gregory (1867&#150;1955), daughter of Sir William Earle Welby-Gregory, fourth baronet. Under pressure from Balfour, he was forced to marry her on 11 October 1893, when it was thought that she was pregnant by him. Nina adored her husband but this affection was not returned and she lived a childless and lonely marriage.<br>
<br>In 1895 Cust retired from parliament. He had been denounced by the feminist Millicent Fawcett, as a scoundrel unfit for public office. He devoted himself to journalism. In October 1892 he met the American millionaire William Waldorf Astor, who, at their first meeting, invited Cust to edit the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. He accepted at once, despite lacking any working knowledge of such a position. During his editorship he made the paper the best evening paper of the day. Among his contributors were H. G. Wells, Alice Meynell, and Rudyard Kipling. His journalism was active in that he did not flinch from saying what he thought needed to be said. This strong trait, together with political disagreements and the rejection of Astor's own written contributions, finally forced Astor to dismiss him in February 1896. Such was the loyalty of his staff that they had to be persuaded by him not to resign. His short period as an editor was the high point of his professional career.<br>
<br>Cust continued his social life in London and found time to write the introduction to Machiavelli's <span class="italic">The Art of War</span> and <span class="italic">Florentine History</span> in the <span class="roman">Tudor Translations</span> series, edited by his friend W. E. Henley. During his time at the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> Cust contributed many poems and these were collected by his widow and his nephew Ronald Storrs and published in 1918 as <span class="italic">Occasional Poems</span>. As a poet his sole claim to fame was as author of &#145;Non nobis domine&#146;, though his authorship was not recognized until the second edition of the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of English Verse</span> (1939). In 1900 he re-entered parliament as member for Bermondsey; he remained there until 1906. In August 1914 he founded and became chairman of the fund-raising central committee for national patriotic organizations. He served as a JP for Lincolnshire and also Bedfordshire.<br>
<br>Cust was of average height and an assiduous dresser, as is shown to good effect in the Spy cartoon of 1894. Lady Diana Cooper thought him &#145;Very beautiful with noble hands and impeccable filbert-shaped nails. He wore a coat such as I never saw another wear&#151;dark blue cloth, flaring, full, with a flat sable Eton collar. It was like Holbein's <span class="italic">Ambassadors</span>&#146;  (Abdy and Gere, 69). He was one of the greatest conversationalists of his time, and Curzon aptly sums him up in the obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>: &#145;He was the unchallenged leader of the dinner-table. Quip, retort, repartee, quotation, allusion, epigram, jest&#151;all flashed with lightning-speed from that active workshop, his brain&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 March 1917). One succinct and brash parliamentary quotation illustrates this: &#145;My position is quite clear, I have nailed my colours to the fence&#146;  (Abdy and Gere, 70). He was the cousin of the third and last Earl Brownlow (1844&#150;1921) and spent his life vainly waiting to inherit the barony of Brownlow. Cust died of heart failure at his home, 17 Hyde Park Gate, London, on 2 March 1917 and after cremation at Golders Green on 5 March was buried at Belton church, Lincolnshire, on 7 March. Nina Cust survived him by thirty-eight years.<br>
