<span class="headword">Martyn,  Edith  How</span>  (1875&#150;1954), <span class="occ">suffragist and advocate of birth control</span>, was born on 17 June 1875 at Bexley Road, Lessness Heath, Erith, Kent, the daughter of Edwin How, grocer, and his wife, Anne Darley. She was educated at The Hall, Cheltenham, and North London Collegiate School for Girls, and studied at University College, Aberystwyth. She was awarded a BSc (external) by the University of London in 1903 and gained an MSc in economics in 1922. The first woman associate of the Royal College of Science (mathematics and physics), she lectured in mathematics at Westfield College for a short time. On 4 August 1899 she married George Herbert Martyn, a science teacher. The couple, who were married for fifty-five years, did not have any children.<br>
<br>How Martyn later admitted that she had &#145;been a rebel ever since I can remember&#146;, adding, &#145;I was always in hot water at school, even in my very earliest school days, because I resented the difference made between boys and girls, and the greater amount of liberty allowed to the former&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Vote</span>, 19 March 1910, 244). Her suffrage career began in the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), which she joined after going to a meeting. The women present &#145;were like a revelation to me. For the first time I felt I had met women who were strong and self-reliant &hellip; My imagination was fired&#146;  (ibid.). She resigned her post at Westfield College to devote the whole of her time to the WSPU. She first spoke in public in the deputation to Asquith on 21 June 1906, and was one of the first women to be imprisoned that year. In 1907, however, disillusioned by the WSPU's undemocratic structure, she and others founded the Women's Freedom League (WFL), a non-violent, militant organization. How Martyn became a leading strategist at the height of the suffrage campaign and was unanimously appointed honorary secretary of the League.<br>
<br>From 1910, when she joined the Malthusian League, How Martyn attempted to promote public discussion of contraception, at the time a very contentious issue avoided by suffrage organizations. Her beliefs were not motivated by Malthusian doctrine, but by her feminism: by the view that women had the right to sexual fulfilment and by her concern for women's welfare. Disliking Mrs Despard's authoritarian style of leadership, she retired on health grounds as head of the WFL's political and militant department in April 1912.<br>
<br>In 1918 How Martyn was one of the first women parliamentary candidates, standing as independent (liberal) in Hendon, Middlesex. She was elected as the first woman councillor in Middlesex county council in 1919 and served for three years. In 1921 she helped the Malthusian League establish one of the first birth control clinics in Britain. During the 1920s she helped to mobilize public opinion in Britain to promote birth control both as morally acceptable and as an essential aspect of sexual relations. She was the linchpin of an extensive campaign to bring birth control to poorer women through local authority provision, arguing that birth control information was a &#145;legitimate and natural extension of the work of Maternity and Child Welfare Centres&#146;  (How Martyn).<br>
<br>How Martyn continued to debate suffrage issues, and in 1927 she wrote that she agreed with both sides in the dispute between new and old feminism within the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC). She shared Mrs Abbott's definition of equality and feminism, yet, as one anxious to realize this equality, &#145;I soon find myself ranged as an ardent supporter of Miss Eleanor Rathbone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, 218). In October 1932, just back from visiting Russia, she claimed that its government &#145;has established complete political, economic and social equality between men and women, while their organisation for the welfare of mothers and children compares very favourably with that of any other country in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jus Suffragii</span>, 4). In 1928 she founded the Suffragette Fellowship with Lilian Lenton, to preserve memories of the fight for women's suffrage; its records have provided much of the primary source material for the historiography of the Edwardian suffragettes.<br>
<br>From 1915 Edith How Martyn had worked with the American Margaret Sanger aiming to bring contraceptive knowledge to women all over the world. They felt women's needs were being ignored in international debate where many interests&#151;religious, scientific, medical, and eugenic and sexual reformism&#151;jostled with politico-economic considerations. They wanted women to have access to safe, cheap, reliable methods of contraception which could be used in homes without basic sanitation, water, or privacy, and where females had little control over sexual initiative. In 1927 How Martyn set up a small office in Geneva, hoping to establish a permanent bureau close to the League of Nations for international exchange of birth control information. In 1934 she made the first of several visits to India, perceiving that, as India emerged from colonialism, it might be possible to integrate women's reproductive needs into programmes for social and health reform. She introduced Margaret Sanger to Mahatma Gandhi, but they could not convince him of the benefits of contraception. How Martyn also visited China, Ceylon, Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, Japan, Hawaii, Jamaica, and North America. Finances were always meagre and ultimately How Martyn's Birth Control International Information Centre was amalgamated with the other voluntary organizations which eventually formed the Family Planning Association and International Planned Parenthood.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Edith How Martyn set out on another propaganda tour, accompanied by her husband. They spent a year in New Zealand, and then went on to Australia. They did not return to England (or go on to South Africa as intended) but settled in Australia. Increasing ill health and penury clouded the remaining years of How Martyn's life. She died in Sydney on 2 February 1954. Her husband died a few months later.<br>
