<span class="headword">Price,  Henry Habberley</span>  (1899&#150;1984), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born in Neath, Glamorgan, on 17 May 1899, the son of Henry Habberley Price, a mechanical engineer, and his wife, Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lombard. He was educated at Winchester College and then served in the Royal Flying Corps (later the RAF) during 1917&#150;19. After the war he proceeded to New College, Oxford, as a scholar to read <i>literae humaniores</i>. He took a first in 1921. In the following year he was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and he was an assistant lecturer at Liverpool University in 1922 and 1923. During this period he also spent some time at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he acquainted himself with the philosophical approaches of G. E. Moore and C. D. Broad; these he found more congenial than the idealism which still dominated Oxford philosophy. In 1924 he was elected a fellow and lecturer in philosophy at Trinity College, Oxford, where he remained until 1935; in that year he was elected Wykeham professor of logic and moved to New College. <br>
<br>Price specialized in epistemology, particularly the problem of knowledge of the external world. In 1932 he published <span class="italic">Perception</span>, which attempted to articulate a non-phenomenalist alternative to the causal theory of perception. Phenomenalism regarded objects as &#145;permanent possibilities of sensation&#146; whereas Price refused to identify families of sense data with the physical objects which cause them. Instead he pursued a phenomenological method to articulate a relation of &#145;belonging&#146; between sense data and physical objects. <br>
<br>Price continued his research into the philosophy of perception with his <span class="italic">Hume's Theory of the External World</span> (1940), a sustained and sympathetic reading of a much neglected section of Hume's <span class="italic">Treatise</span>. Hume had been unable to reconcile sensory experience of an external world with sceptical reason, whereas Price envisaged a resolution of these two faculties through the concept of the imagination which makes perception of the material world possible. According to this interpretation the imagination plays a role akin to Kant's transcendental ego. Hence it sees Hume as somewhat closer to Kant than is usually acknowledged. <br>
<br>Price also explored the philosophy of thinking, and published his findings in <span class="italic">Thinking and Experience</span> (1953), an analysis of the nature of concepts and their relation to sense experience. He took issue both with the symbolistic theory, which identified conceptual thought with the use of symbols, and with the classical account&#151;attributed to Descartes, Locke, and Kant&#151;which regarded concepts as mental entities. Instead Price proposed that concepts are dispositions rather than entities and that memory is crucial to conceptual cognition. <br>
<br>Price was regarded as an outstanding lecturer and a considerate tutor and supervisor. J. O. Urmson, an undergraduate at Corpus Christi College in the 1930s, remembered Price as the teacher &#145;who at the time young philosophers wanting to break out a bit went to &hellip; a rather left-wing example of the traditional school&#146;  (private information). Price retired from the Wykeham chair in 1959. His successor, A. J. Ayer, had earlier attended and been influenced by his lectures. In his inaugural lecture Ayer spoke of Price's influence:<blockquote>In the sombre philosophical climate of the Oxford of that time, here was a bold attempt to let in air and light: a theory of perception in which the principles of British empiricism were developed with a rigour and attention to detail which they had in that context never received. (Ayer, 79)</blockquote>After retiring from his chair Price continued to be philosophically active. He was a visiting professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1962 and pursued his interest in religion. His Gifford lectures given in 1960 (published in 1969 as <span class="italic">Belief</span>) examined theories of belief and considered the implications of his arguments for propositions on the immortality of the soul and the existence of God. <i>Contra</i> the positivist doctrines made popular by Ayer which regarded such propositions as meaningless, Price argued that there is evidence for both the soul and God from the existence of paranormal phenomena. <br>
<br>Price was interested in parapsychology&#151;telepathy, clairvoyance, telekinesis, apparitions, hauntings, mediumship, the psychic ether, and survival after death&#151;throughout his career, but he never attempted to integrate it with his more orthodox philosophical work. He also gave the Sarum lectures in Oxford in 1970 on similar themes, later published as <span class="italic">Essays on the Philosophy of Religion</span> (1972). A further volume of this work was published posthumously in 1995 as <span class="italic">Philosophical Interactions with Parapsychology</span>. In 1939 he was president of the Society for Psychical Research. <br>
<br>Price, who never married, lived with his sister, Katy, in Headington, Oxford, where he enjoyed his hobbies of watercolour painting and ornithology. Although a shy man he was a generous host to former pupils and colleagues from abroad, organizing bird-watching expeditions and visits into the woods at night to hear nightingales. He died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 26 November 1984.<br>
