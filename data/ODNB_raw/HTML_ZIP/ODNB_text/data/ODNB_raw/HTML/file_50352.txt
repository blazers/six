<span class="headword">Shimmin,  Hugh</span>  (1819&#150;1879), <span class="occ">journalist and journal editor</span>, was born on 6 September 1819, in Castletown, Isle of Man. His father was a stonemason but very little is known about his parents.<br>
<br>Shimmin's life might be rendered as a Smilesian story of triumphant self-help and character, pulling the protagonist up from humble origins in defiance of all temptations. Of Manx extraction, he spent his early years in Whitehaven, migrating to Liverpool in his teens with his mother to join his father, a stonemason with a drink problem. The evidence is not entirely conclusive, but he seems to have been brought up in poverty and sent to work at eight years old. His father died in the fifth year of his apprenticeship to a bookbinder. Shimmin then supported his family by collecting rents for his landlord, while impressing his employer sufficiently to take charge of the bookbindery after completing his apprenticeship, incurring the hostility of colleagues who resented his opposition to drinking customs. With this abstemiousness went the pursuit of self-improvement through education, as Shimmin joined the Mental Improvement Society at the Liverpool Institute and then the mechanics' institution in his mid-twenties, coming into contact with Unitarian and Methodist social reformers. He was an active Wesleyan at this stage. At some time, probably in the 1840s, he made a prudent (though childless) marriage: the savings of his wife, Jane (of whose origins nothing has been discovered), were exactly sufficient to buy the bookbinding business.<br>
<br>By his mid-thirties Shimmin was established as a modestly successful businessman. From the mid-1850s his writing gave him a public face and local fame. He began with occasional articles on various subjects in the Liverpool press, but during 1855&#150;6 he wrote a series of expos&eacute;s of Liverpool's drinking dens, cheap music-halls, dog-fighting taverns, and other haunts of iniquity and vice, which disturbed and titillated readers of the <span class="italic">Liverpool Mercury</span>. These were later published in book form as <span class="italic">Liverpool Life</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">Liverpool Sketches</span> (1863). His brutally frank <span class="italic">Pen-and-Ink Portraits of Liverpool Town Councillors</span> (1866) had originally appeared in 1857. From this journalistic success Shimmin moved on to be editor and joint proprietor of the new satirical weekly, <span class="italic">The Porcupine</span>, which appeared in 1860 and which outlived him, surviving until 1913. Its scarifying denunciations of sanitary conditions and moral failings, and deflations of municipal pomposity, found a ready audience. Shimmin's blunt and moralistic rhetoric made him enemies as well as friends. In 1870 he was imprisoned for libel after accusing maritime interests of insurance frauds, despite the sympathetic intervention of many leading citizens, including Charles Booth. In later life he retreated from radical liberalism and became a fervent Anglican. But he remained active in educational and other charities, and his funeral attracted an immense crowd.<br>
<br>Shimmin said little about working conditions and practices, or about ethnic and sectarian divisions. He resisted the contemporary temptation to blame the Irish for social problems. He ascribed social ills to individual failings, although not solely to working-class ones. He disliked misplaced and maladministered charity, blaming drink for many social problems while remaining hostile to the temperance movement. These attitudes, like his emphasis on female virtue and steadiness and on frugal domestic management, flowed from his own experience. His pertinacity and powers of observation gave him enough material to make him an important commentator on Victorian urban provincial life.<br>
<br>Shimmin was a lively and combative journalist under whose editorship <span class="italic">The Porcupine</span> became famous for campaigns against the evils which were pungently described in its pages, and for unsparing commentaries on local politics and politicians. His writings offer insights into popular enjoyments, working-class domestic life, and the problems of charitable and municipal initiatives for social improvement during the mid-Victorian years in Liverpool, then Britain's second city, which was famous not only as the focal point of the Atlantic economy, but also for appalling living conditions, death-rates, immorality, and vice. He described these conditions, and the problems of policing a great seaport, in graphic detail, but failed to explain their roots or propose ways of ameliorating them. Nevertheless, his work stands comparison with better-known commentators such as Henry Mayhew. Shimmin died of &#145;apoplexy&#146; at his home, 5 Radstock Road, Liverpool, on 12 January 1879 and was buried on 15 January at Anfield cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
