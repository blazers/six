<span class="headword">Atkyns,  John Tracy</span>  (1706&#150;1773), <span class="occ">law reporter</span>, was born John Tracy at Lower Swell, Gloucestershire, on 10 January 1706, the second surviving son of John Tracy of Stanway, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Atkyns of Sapperton, Gloucestershire, chief baron of the exchequer. His great-grandfather was John Tracy, third Viscount Tracy of Toddington, Gloucestershire. He adopted the name of Atkyns, probably because of his grandfather's legal eminence, some time after 1732, though by 1767 he had reverted to his original name, making his will in that year as John Tracy.<br>
<br>Atkyns matriculated at New College, Oxford, on 10 November 1724 together with his elder twin brother, Robert, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 4 February 1725. There is no evidence that he took a degree at Oxford, but he paid rent to New College until 1728, when the college refunded his caution money. On 14 November 1732 he was called to the bar. He married Catherine Lindsay; they had no children.<br>
<br>Atkyns was a &#145;very correct&#146; taker of notes of cases in the court of chancery  (Wilmot, 199), largely during the lord chancellorship of Philip Yorke, Lord Hardwicke, 1736&#150;56. However, in 1748 Hardwicke refused his consent to the publication of these notes, and this prompted a letter to the lord chancellor from Robert Tracy, then MP for Worcester, outlining his brother's &#145;uneasy circumstances owing to a tedious and unsuccessful application to his profession&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35590, fol. 71<i>v</i>). Robert Tracy asked for some preferment in the law for him, the refusal of permission to publish his notes having denied him both honour and profit. In 1762 Atkyns's wife wrote to Hardwicke's son, Charles Yorke, asking him to intercede with his father to obtain permission for publication. The notes were eventually published in three volumes of reports digested under alphabetical heads in 1765&#150;8, soon after Hardwicke's death. Despite the opinion of the chief justice of the common pleas, Sir John Eardley Wilmot, of the correctness of Atkyns's note-taking, the reputation for accuracy of the published reports was not of the highest: Sir James Mansfield, chief justice of the common pleas, regarded them as &#145;extremely inaccurate&#146;  (<i>Olive v. Smith</i>, 1813), and in 1765 the court of king's bench refused to allow the first volume to be cited as authority. A second edition appeared in 1781 and a third edition, much improved, by Francis William Sanders in 1794.<br>
<br>By 1748 Hardwicke had promised Atkyns that he would recommend him to the king to be made a baron of the exchequer upon a vacancy, and on the retirement of Edward Barker, Atkyns was appointed cursitor baron of the exchequer on 22 April 1755, which post he held until his death. Sir John Eardley Wilmot thought Atkyns a &#145;cheerful, good-humoured, honest man; a good husband, master, and friend&#146;  (Wilmot, 199). He died on 22 July 1773 in London. At the time of his death he was living at Parliament Street, Westminster. Atkyns was survived by his wife.<br>
