<span class="headword">Sherlock,  William</span>  (1639/40&#150;1707), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Gravel Lane, Southwark, London, the son of a tradesman. He was educated at St Mary Overie, Southwark, and from about 1653 at Eton College, and was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a pensioner under William Falkner on 19 May 1657, aged seventeen. He was elected scholar in 1658, graduated BA in 1660, and MA in 1663. Sherlock spent some years without a steady position in the church, and, if later allegations by Robert South were true, may have been a dissenting preacher, but on 3 August 1669 he was collated as rector of St George's, Botolph Lane, London. This position enabled him to marry Elizabeth Gardner (<i>d</i>. 1715?) on 8 February 1673, at the Charterhouse Chapel; her father, whose first name may have been William, lived in the parish of St Andrew Undershaft, London.<h2>
<a name="Riseofacontroversialdivine"></a>Rise of a controversial divine</h2>Sherlock's first publication, <span class="italic">The Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and Union with Him</span> (1674) was aimed at the Independent divine John Owen, who asserted that God's mercy could be known only through Christ. Sherlock's ridicule of this position brought a reply from Owen in which he was supported by several other dissenters, including Thomas Danson, Edward Polhil, and Vincent Alsop. Sherlock answered in <span class="italic">A Defence and Continuation of the Discourse</span> (1675). This controversy, in which Sherlock's position was attacked by some dissenters as moralist, gave expression to the theological differences between dissenters and Anglicans, although many Anglicans held Calvinist opinions and many dissenters were moralist. One counter-attack was Robert Ferguson's <span class="italic">The Interest of Reason in Religion</span> (1675) to which Sherlock and Joseph Glanvill, another of Ferguson's targets, replied in <span class="italic">An Account of Mr Ferguson his Common-Place-Book</span> (1675), ignoring Ferguson's arguments but charging him with extensive plagiarism of Glanvill and other authors. Sherlock attacked Owen again in the anonymous <span class="italic">A Discourse about Church Unity</span> (1681). <span class="italic">The Case of Resistance to the Supreme Powers</span> (1684) defended the doctrine of passive obedience. In 1684 he also edited and published William Falkner's <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span> with his own dedication to the archbishop of Canterbury, William Sancroft.<br>
<br>Sherlock's controversial works accompanied his steady rise in London's clerical world. He became the fourth assistant at Sion College in 1673, rising to second assistant the following year. He was senior dean at Sion in 1680 and served a one-year term as president in 1683. Sherlock received his DD in 1680 and the prebend of St Pancras at St Paul's Cathedral on 3 November 1681. He also received a lecturership at St Dunstan's and in 1685 he became master of the Temple in succession to Richard Ball, with the use of a house and an annual salary of &pound;100 from the Inner Temple, &pound;70 in lieu of chambers from the Middle Temple, and &pound;37 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. from the crown.<br>
<br>Sherlock was a leader among the brilliant group of London divines including Thomas Tenison, William Clagett, and Simon Patrick who carried on the literary defence of the Church of England against Catholicism from late in the reign of Charles II into that of James II. Sherlock's <span class="italic">Protestant Resolution of Faith</span>, first published in 1683, was republished in 1685, 1686, and 1687, at the height of the struggle under James. Sherlock's concern over James's Catholicism was voiced early in the reign, in a sermon preached before the House of Commons on 29 May 1685, the anniversary of the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Sherlock attacked Catholicism as tending to disloyalty, while asserting his faith in James personally. The Commons voted Sherlock their thanks and ordered the sermon published. It went through two editions in 1685. In 1686 he was appointed a chaplain to James II.<br>
<br>Sherlock was a prolific author of anti-Catholic publications in James's reign. Of these, the two-part <span class="italic">A Preservative Against Popery</span> (1688) provided simple versions of the main protestant arguments, enabling ordinary protestants without theological training to defend themselves against Catholic claims. It went through several editions and provoked a response from the Jesuit polemicist Lewis Sabran, <span class="italic">An Answer to Dr Sherlock's Preservative against Popery</span> (1688). Sherlock replied in <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Preservative</span> (1688). Several of Sherlock's anti-Catholic writings became part of the canon of eighteenth-century anti-Catholicism by their inclusion in Edmund Gibson's collection, <span class="italic">Preservative Against Popery</span>. Sherlock, like most of his allies, continued to uphold the doctrine of passive obedience, but refused to read the declaration of indulgence in 1687, by which James granted freedom of worship to non-Anglican Christians. Sherlock feared losing his lucrative position at the Temple and asked the nonconformist minister John Howe what Howe would do if he were offered the position. He was reassured to hear that Howe would take it, but resign the emoluments to Sherlock. Sherlock's house was the meeting place for some bishops and London clergy on 11 May 1688, where they considered responses to the declaration.<h2>
<a name="Theoaths"></a>The oaths</h2>Sherlock's conduct following the revolution of 1688 was disastrous to his reputation, if not his career. At first he took a very high-church line, opposing compromises with the dissenters for a more comprehensive church and publishing <span class="italic">A Letter to a Member of the convention</span> (1689), which called for James's recall upon conditions. A meeting of the clergy at Ely House on 21 January 1689 saw an argument between Sherlock and William of Orange's leading clerical supporter, Gilbert Burnet. (Burnet had earlier included Sherlock in a list of ten Church of England clergy which he recommended to William.) After some hesitation Sherlock refused to take the oaths to William and Mary, and was reckoned a leading nonjuror. He attempted to persuade others to follow his example, with some success. When the day arrived for the suspension of nonjurors, 1 August 1689, he did not preach.<br>
<br>On 2 February 1690, the day after the day fixed for deprivation, Sherlock stunned ecclesiastical London by preaching at St Dunstan's and praying for William and Mary as <i>de facto</i> sovereigns. At this time he was still not intending to take the oaths. Sherlock was deprived of his position at the Temple, and paid for preachers there out of his own pocket. Shortly after his prayer for the king and queen Sherlock's continuing opposition to the oaths led to a break with Robert South, with whom he had gone over the arguments for and against swearing. In a letter addressed to South on 17 February 1690 Sherlock attacked South for circulating a paper which Sherlock had written supporting taking the oaths, and also ridiculed South's own arguments for taking them. South wrote a scorching reply, breaking off friendly relations.<br>
<br>By the spring Sherlock began withdrawing from his opposition to the oaths, and he took them that August. Sherlock claimed that he had been convinced by canon 28 in the convocation book of John Overall, bishop of Coventry and Lichfield and of Norwich in the reign of James I, which had been published the previous month. This canon endorsed praying for <i>de facto</i> sovereigns. Sherlock's claim, made in the preface to his defence of his action, <span class="italic">The Case of the Allegiance due to Sovereign Powers</span> (dated 1691, but actually published late in 1690) convinced few, although the book was extremely popular, going through six editions. Sherlock's yielding was widely credited to his belief that the Stuart cause was irretrievable after the battle of the Boyne in July, or to the influence of his wife. Elizabeth Sherlock was nearly as much reviled as her husband, being compared to Xanthippe, the shrewish wife of Socrates, and Eve who tempted Adam. Whatever Sherlock's motivations, his career did not seem to suffer. He was restored as master of the Temple, where he remained until 1705, and on 15 June 1691 he was installed as dean of St Paul's, in succession to John Tillotson. The Temple reimbursed him for the expense of the preachers he had hired in his period of deprivation. He also became a chaplain to the king and queen in 1691.<br>
<br>Sherlock's argument for <i>de facto</i> obedience, made in <span class="italic">The Case of the Allegiance due to Sovereign Powers</span>, exposed him to attack from both the nonjurors, who regarded him as a traitor and timeserver, and the whigs, who found his acceptance of William and Mary grudging at best. Whigs also believed that Sherlock's identification of the right of William and Mary as exclusively <i>de facto</i> meant that the liberties of Englishmen were now without legal foundation. One of the most effective among many nonjuring replies was John Kettlewell's anonymous <span class="italic">The duty of allegiance settled upon its true grounds, in answer to a late book of Dr Will. Sherlock, entituled &#145;The case of the allegiance due to sovereign powers&#146;</span> (1691), while the Revd Samuel Johnson, a whig, published <span class="italic">Remarks upon Dr Sherlock's Book, Intituled, &#145;The Case of the Allegiance due to Sovereign Powers&#146;</span> (1690). Sherlock responded to his nonjuring opponents in <span class="italic">The Case of Allegiance due to Sovereign Powers, Further Consider'd, and Defended</span> (1691).<h2>
<a name="Practicaldivinity"></a>Practical divinity</h2>Sherlock's most frequently reprinted books were not his controversial works but works of religious exposition addressed to a broad Christian audience. During his brief nonjuring period Sherlock published what would be the most frequently reprinted of all his books, <span class="italic">A Practical Discourse Concerning Death</span> (1689), originally intended as a series of sermons to be given at the Temple, but which Sherlock was unable to preach before he was deprived. It became one of the most popular religious books of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and in addition to many subsequent editions, was published in a Welsh translation by Thomas Williams in 1691 and an anonymous French translation in 1693. The <span class="italic">Practical Discourse</span> argued that, as human beings were naturally motivated towards pleasure, the superiority of the Christian life could be proved in these terms. The spiritual existence of the human soul was infinitely longer than that of the body, and the pains and pleasures of the soul were correspondingly larger than those which could be experienced by the flesh. Consequently the expectation of pleasure could act as an incentive towards a religious existence on earth. <span class="italic">A Practical Discourse Concerning a Future Judgement</span> received two editions in 1692, and was also reprinted on several occasions. It was followed in 1694 by <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Divine Providence</span> and in 1704 by <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Happiness of Good Men</span>.<h2>
<a name="Thetrinitariancontroversy"></a>The trinitarian controversy</h2>Sherlock entered another important theological controversy in 1690, that over Socinianism, the denial of the divine nature of Jesus Christ. Sherlock had been working on trinitarian issues for some time, and intended his <span class="italic">Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity</span> (1690) to be a major contribution. He put forth a new interpretation of the Trinity as three persons united by a mutual consciousness. Sherlock was one of the first English thinkers to use extensively the concept of consciousness, in which he may have been influenced by John Turner's <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Messias</span> (1685). But trinitarian issues were always fraught with danger, and some thought that the vigour of Sherlock's attack on Socinianism had brought him to the opposite error of tritheism, the making of the Trinity into three separate gods. Among those was South, who now saw an opportunity to express his scorn of Sherlock. South's anonymous <span class="italic">Animadversions on Dr Sherlock's Book</span> (1693) was crushing. Sherlock replied with the anonymous <span class="italic">Defence of Dr Sherlock's Notion</span> (1694), which South answered in <span class="italic">Tritheism Charged upon Dr Sherlock's Notion</span> (1695). Other leading English theologians and philosophers involved in the controversy were John Wallis, Richard Burthogge, Edward Stillingfleet, and Francis Gastrell. On the continent Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz spoke of Sherlock with great respect, and deplored the harshness of South's attack, while agreeing that Sherlock had come very close to tritheism.<br>
<br>Whatever the merits of his case Sherlock got the worst of the dispute. Joseph Bingham's Oxford sermon following Sherlock on the Trinity provoked condemnation of its doctrine by the hebdomadal council as &#145;false, impious and heretical&#146; on 25 November 1695. Sherlock responded with <span class="italic">A Modest Examination of the Authority and Reasons of the Late Decree</span> (1696), but the controversy ended after William III, prompted by Thomas Tenison, then archbishop of Canterbury, gave directions, addressed to the Church of England hierarchy, forbidding the use of new terms relating to the Trinity on 3 February 1696. Sherlock's sermon <span class="italic">The Danger of Corrupting the Faith by Philosophy</span>, preached before the lord mayor and aldermen of London on 25 April 1697, and his <span class="italic">The Present State of the Socinian Controversy</span> (1698) mark his retreat.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>In 1698 Sherlock was appointed rector of Therfield, Hertfordshire, in succession to William Holder. The living was in the gift of the dean and chapter of St Paul's. Much of his later career was devoted to advancing his eldest son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25380/', "Thomas Sherlock (1677&#150;1761)")</script>, who succeeded his father as rector of Therfield in 1702 and as master of the Temple in 1705. A younger son, John, entered the law, being admitted to the bar at the Inner Temple on 2 July 1704. Mary Sherlock, one of Sherlock's two daughters, married Dr Thomas Gooch [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10941/', "Gooch, Sir Thomas, second baronet")</script>], the future bishop of Ely, in 1717. William Sherlock continued to defend publicly what he regarded as Church of England orthodoxy. <span class="italic">The New Danger of Presbytery</span> (1703), a reply to Charles Trimnell's <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Proceedings of some Members of the Lower House of the Last Convocation</span>, attacked high-church zealotry, while <span class="italic">The Scripture Proofs of our Saviour's Divinity</span> (1706) rebutted Bishop Edward Fowler's <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Descent of the Man-Christ Jesus from Heaven</span> (1706). Neither had the success of Sherlock's earlier writings or was reprinted. Sherlock's collected sermons, first published in 1700 as <span class="italic">Sermons Preach'd on Several Occasions</span>, were issued three times in the eighteenth century, and translated into German in 1744. William Sherlock died at Hampstead, Middlesex, on 19 June 1707, and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
