<span class="headword">Olivers,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1725, <em>d.</em> 1799), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher and hymn writer</span>, was the son of Thomas Olivers (<i>d</i>. 1729) and his wife, Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1730). The parish register of Tregynon, Montgomeryshire, shows that he was baptized on 8 September 1725. After his father and his mother died, he was entrusted to the care of a great-uncle, who, however, did not long survive Olivers's parents, but left him a small legacy. The interest was to be employed in the child's upbringing, and the principal paid to him when he came of age. He received &#145;such learning as was thought necessary&#146; at Forden, Montgomeryshire, but became a wild and reckless young man, much given to cursing and swearing, and who became known as &#145;the worst boy who had been in those parts for the last twenty or thirty years&#146;  (Jackson, 2.49). At the age of eighteen he was apprenticed to a cobbler, but continued in his violent and careless ways, so much so that (following a scandal over his ill-treatment of a girl) he was forced to leave Wales. He went to Shrewsbury, and from there he wandered through the Welsh border counties until he reached Bristol. There he heard George Whitefield preach on the text &#145;is not this a brand plucked from the fire?&#146; and was converted. He joined the Methodists at Bradford in Wiltshire, and became a conspicuously reformed character, preaching and also repaying those whom he had cheated in previous years.<br>
<br>In 1753 John Wesley, who later summed up Olivers as having &#145;good in him&#146; but also as &#145;a rough stick of wood&#146;, chose Olivers to be one of his itinerant preachers. He was sent to Devon, and then to Cornwall; from there he went to Norfolk, where he was attacked by a mob when attempting to preach at Yarmouth, and then to London, Ireland, Leeds, Lancashire, York, Newcastle, and other places in quick succession. He married, probably in 1757 or 1758, a Miss Green, &#145;noted through all the north of England for her extraordinary piety&#146;  (Jackson, 2.80). In 1773 he became for a year Wesley's companion on his preaching tours: the minutes of the Methodist conference recorded that &#145;Thomas Olivers travels with Mr Wesley&#146;. In 1775 he was appointed supervisor of the Methodist press, a position which he held until 1789, when Wesley removed him for making too many mistakes: &#145;I cannot, dare not, will not suffer Thomas Olivers to murder the <span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span> any longer. The errata are intolerable and innumerable&#146;  (J. Wesley to T. Bradshaw, 15 Aug 1789, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 8.160). Despite his errors, the quick-tempered Olivers was a formidable pamphleteer, who engaged in fierce controversies with the Calvinists of his day, such as Augustus Montagu Toplady and Rowland Hill, who attacked Olivers on the grounds that he had once been &#145;a journeyman shoemaker&#146;. His ferocity in the pamphlet wars of the early Methodist years earned him from Toplady the sobriquet of Wesley's Bully in Chief. &#145;Mr Wesley&#146;, wrote Toplady, &#145;skulks for shelter under a cobbler's apron&#146;.<br>
<br>In spite of this expenditure of energy on pamphleteering, Olivers is best known for writing a great hymn of the early Methodist years, &#145;The God of Abrah'm praise&#146;. He is said to have been inspired to write it by hearing the Hebrew <span class="italic">Yigdal</span> sung by Meyer Lyon, cantor at the Great Synagogue in London, about 1770. Olivers asked Lyon to write down the tune and composed the hymn to fit it. He was the author of other strong hymns, such as &#145;Come, immortal king of glory&#146;, and of a poem entitled &#145;A Descriptive and Plaintive Elegy on the Death of the Late Reverend John Wesley&#146;, written on Wesley's death in 1791. He is also thought to be the composer of the hymn tune &#145;Helmsley&#146; (printed with the name &#145;Olivers&#146; in a Wesleyan hymnbook of 1765), used for &#145;Lo, he comes with clouds descending&#146;. His pamphlets were numerous and polemical, although the posthumously published <span class="italic">A Defence of Methodism</span> (1818) is a record of a debate held in 1785 (&#145;Have the Methodists done most good or evil?&#146;) which shows his skill in reasoned argument. After his dismissal from the <span class="italic">Arminian Magazine</span> Olivers spent the remainder of his life in retirement in London, where he died on 7 March 1799, in Hoxton. He was regarded by the early Methodists as one of the foremost disciples of John Wesley, and was buried in Wesley's tomb in the grounds of the New Chapel, City Road, London.<br>
