<span class="headword">Peters,  Charles</span>  (1690&#150;1774), <span class="occ">Hebraist and Church of England clergyman</span>, born at Tregony, Cornwall, on 1 December 1690, was the eldest child of Richard Peters. He was educated at Tregony School under a Mr Daddow, and matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 3 April 1707; he graduated BA (27 October 1710), MA (5 June 1713), and was a batteler of his college from 8 April 1707 to 20 July 1713. Having been ordained into the Anglican church, he was curate of St Just in Roseland, Cornwall, from 1710 to 1715, when he was appointed by Elizabeth, Lady Mohun, to the rectory of Boconnoc in the same county. He remained there until 1723, and during his incumbency built the south front of the old parsonage-house. On 10 December 1723 Peters was instituted to the rectory of Bratton-Clovelly, Devon, and in November 1726 was appointed to the rectory of St Mabyn, Cornwall, holding both preferments until his death. To the poor of St Mabyn he was very charitable; and, being himself unmarried, he educated the two eldest sons, John and Jonathan, of his brother, John.<br>
<br>Peters knew Hebrew well (he was, according to the literary chronicler Richard Polwhele, &#145;the first Hebrew scholar in Europe&#146;), and at St Mabyn he was able to pursue his studies without interruption. In 1751 he published <span class="italic">A Critical Dissertation on the Book of Job</span>, in which he criticized Bishop William Warburton's account, proved the book's antiquity, and demonstrated that a future state was the popular belief of the ancient Jews or Hebrews. A second edition, corrected and with a lengthy preface of ninety pages, appeared in 1757; the preface was also issued separately. Warburton, in the notes to his <span class="italic">Divine Legation of Moses</span>, always wrote contemptuously of Peters. The retort of Bishop Robert Lowth on the latter's behalf, in his printed letter to Warburton (1765), was that &#145;the very learned and ingenious person&#146;, Mr Peters, had given his antagonist &#145;a Cornish hug&#146;, from which he would be sore as long as he lived. Peters published in 1760 <span class="italic">An appendix to the critical dissertation on Job, giving a further account of the book of Ecclesiastes</span>, with a reply to some of Warburton's notes; and in 1765 he was engaged in finishing a more elaborate reply which was never published but descended to his nephew with his other manuscripts.<br>
<br>Peters died at St Mabyn on 11 February 1774 and was buried in the chancel of the parish church. In accordance with his desire&#151;expressed two years previously&#151;a volume of his sermons was printed in 1776 by his nephew Jonathan, vicar of St Clement, near Truro. Some extracts from Peters's private prayers, meditations, and letters are printed in Polwhele's <span class="italic">Biographical Sketches in Cornwall</span> (1831).<br>
