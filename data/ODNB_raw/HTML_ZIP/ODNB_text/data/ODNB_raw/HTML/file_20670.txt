<span class="headword">&Oacute;l&aacute;f Guthfrithson</span> <span class="st"> [&Oacute;l&aacute;fr Gu&eth;r&oslash;&eth;arson]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 941), <span class="occ">king of Dublin and of Northumbria</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49273/', "Guthfrith (d. 934)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25543/', "Sihtric C&#225;ech")</script>], a grandson of &Iacute;varr. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23314/', "Ragnall Guthfrithson")</script> was his brother. From his father, who died as king of Dublin, having also been briefly king of Northumbria, &Oacute;l&aacute;f had inherited interests in both Ireland and Britain; the latter would lead to his defeat at the battle of &#145;Brunanburh&#146; (937) by the English king &AElig;thelstan. &Oacute;l&aacute;f first appears in the Irish chronicles in 933, when he sailed a fleet into Strangford Lough and plundered Armagh on 10 November. He then joined with the king of Ulaid, Matud&aacute;n mac &Aacute;eda, to raid as far as Sl&iacute;ab Beagh and Muchnoe (Monaghan). There the allies were confronted by Muirchertach mac N&eacute;ill, and in the ensuing battle &Oacute;l&aacute;f was defeated with the loss of several hundreds of men. Upon the death of his father, Guthfrith, in 934 &Oacute;l&aacute;f assumed the kingship of the men of Dublin. The following year he attacked his northern neighbours S&iacute;l n&Aacute;eda Sl&aacute;ine, during which he destroyed their fortress at Lagore (Meath) and plundered the cave of Knowth. &Oacute;l&aacute;f then turned his attention westwards and began his campaigns to bring the midlands under his control. The army of Dublin raided the important monastery of Clonmacnoise in 936, and &Oacute;l&aacute;f quartered his troops there for two nights. In revenge the high-king Donnchad mac Flainn burned Dublin. The next year, 937, on 1 August, &Oacute;l&aacute;f attacked Lough Ree, which had been a base for the vikings of Limerick since 931. &Oacute;l&aacute;f ensured its demise when he destroyed the boats after capturing the rival captain and his troops.<br>
<br>&Oacute;l&aacute;f's Irish campaigns were interrupted when he led his troops to Britain. His personal sense of grievance against the English king &AElig;thelstan, who had expelled his father from Northumbria, in addition to his desire to take the province himself, led him to fight &AElig;thelstan at the battle of &#145;Brunanburh&#146;. &Oacute;l&aacute;f was joined in that battle by the Scots and by the Britons of Strathclyde. This unexpected alliance had been promoted by the Celts themselves, and a Welsh poem <span class="italic">Armes Prydein</span> (&#145;Prophecy of Britain&#146;) is a call to arms for an alliance of the Welsh, vikings, and Gaels against &AElig;thelstan. The ensuing battle is best known through the Old English poem preserved in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> and through semi-legendary accounts such as that in <span class="italic">Egils saga</span>; it was a murderous and hotly contested fight, but in the end &Oacute;l&aacute;f and his allies were defeated. &Oacute;l&aacute;f fled back to Dublin &#145;in ships with nailed sides&#146; as noted in the Old English poem. His defeat at &#145;Brunanburh&#146; gave courage to his Irish foes, and in 938 territory controlled by Dublin, as far as the River Greece, was attacked by the high-king Donnchad mac Flainn and Muirchertach mac N&eacute;ill. The vikings who attacked Ailech and briefly held Muirchertach in 939 might have been &Oacute;l&aacute;f and his troops, seeking revenge. &Oacute;l&aacute;f raided the monastery of Kilcullen in 939, and soon afterwards left Dublin. While one chronicle claims that his departure was due to divine intervention, the real reason was an invitation from the men of Northumbria who, after the death of &AElig;thelstan, invited &Oacute;l&aacute;f to return to Britain as their king. He had little time to enjoy this prize for in 941, after raiding St Baldred's Church at Tyninghame, he died. Little can be said of his personal life. In later medieval records his wife is called Alfgith, daughter of Orm, but he is also said to have been the son-in-law of the Scottish king Constantine II, his ally at &#145;Brunanburh&#146;. His children might have included the Maccus, son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f, who killed the Norwegian prince and king of Northumbria Erik Bloodaxe in 954, and the Guthfrith, son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f, who died in 961.<br>
