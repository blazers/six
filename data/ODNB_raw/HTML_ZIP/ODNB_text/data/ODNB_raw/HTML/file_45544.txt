<span class="headword">Dawson,  Margaret Mary Damer</span>  (1873&#150;1920), <span class="occ">a founder of the Women's Police Service</span>, was born at 1 York Road, Hove, Sussex, on 12 June 1873, the daughter of Richard Dawson (<i>b</i>. 1829/30), a surgeon, and his wife, Agnes Baird Hemming (1851/2&#150;1926), who in 1914, following her husband's death, married Thomas de Grey, sixth Baron Walsingham, and was styled Agnes, Lady Walsingham. Her education in the main was probably private; however, she studied music under Benno Schoenberger and Herbert Sharpe, winning the gold medal and diploma of an institution called the London Academy of Music. Her independent income enabled Margaret Dawson to move in well-to-do circles, and it supported her in her campaigns. In her adult years she became involved with various philanthropic activities. Although she later helped found a home for abandoned babies, her most notable activity at this period was campaigning for the humane treatment of animals, particularly but not exclusively on the continent. She organized the International Congress of Animal Protection Societies which met in London in 1906. For her work she received awards from the Danish and Finnish societies for animal welfare, and she actively participated, together with Louise Lind-af-Hageby, in the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society.<br>
<br>Dawson was not active in the women's suffrage movement, but she did take an interest in such feminist issues as the campaign against the traffic in women and children, and served on the Criminal Law Amendment Committee in 1914. This led her into the campaign for women police to protect women from sexual exploitation. For some time feminists had become increasingly aware of the shortcomings of the male police in dealing with cases involving women, and especially the sexual abuse of children, and had been considering women's possible role in police work. Nina Boyle of the Women's Freedom League was one of the most prominent in this, but when war came in August 1914 it was Margaret Damer Dawson who took the lead in recruiting women police; she became chief, with Nina Boyle as her deputy. Many of the first recruits, numbering approximately fifty, had experience of being imprisoned as militant suffragists, a point which was stressed by the rival Women's Police Patrols, set up by the National Union of Women Workers (later the National Council of Women). Margaret Damer Dawson's highly respectable non-suffragette background, together with the number of her aristocratic acquaintances, was thus an asset when dealing with figures of authority. Initially the women, all of independent means, called themselves the Women's Police Volunteers, and devised their own version of the police uniform. With the reluctant approval of the metropolitan commissioner they began training with the Metropolitan Police on a purely voluntary basis, in the meantime working with refugees and giving help and advice to women who required it. However, the first call on their services, in November 1914, was from the army at Grantham, to control women &#145;of bad character&#146;, and to enforce the virtual curfew on women in the area. Margaret Damer Dawson agreed to do this, on the grounds that to prove their willingness to accept police discipline &#145;no order, however distasteful, could be shirked&#146;. As a result of this departure from feminist principles Nina Boyle called for her resignation, but a vote of the members overwhelmingly supported Damer Dawson, and it was Nina Boyle who left, and Mary Allen and Ellen Harburn went to Grantham. At this time Margaret Damer Dawson decided to change her group's name to the Women's Police Service.<br>
<br>In 1916 Lloyd George, then minister of munitions, called upon the Women's Police Service to supervise &#145;munitionettes&#146; (women munition workers). Margaret Damer Dawson agreed to supply, train, and uniform 140 women, in the first instance without any financial aid, on the undertaking that if they proved successful they would receive some money. The women were sent to munition factories at Chester and Gretna. Meanwhile training continued in London's West End, and the publicity that this received caused displeasure in Scotland Yard and the Home Office. The great drain on the Women's Police Service's financial resources had been offset by a massive anonymous donation. In 1918 Margaret Damer Dawson was one of those consulted over a move to establish a permanent women's police presence under Home Office control; however, largely because of Metropolitan Police hostility to the supposedly more militant Women's Police Service, in the first instance, it was Mrs Sofia Stanley of the rival Women's Police Patrols who was appointed superintendent (again, the Metropolitan Police commissioner's main aim was that of prostitution control).<br>
<br>After the armistice Margaret Damer Dawson, who had been created OBE, got chief constables throughout the country to take on forty-seven of the demobilized munitions women police, but London's commissioner, Sir Nevil Macready, remained hostile. Although the committee on the employment of women on police duties (the Baird committee), to which Margaret Damer Dawson gave evidence, cautiously approved the principle of employing women police, the Home Office did not hide its reluctance to make any concessions. Shortly after the Baird committee heard its last witness, Margaret Damer Dawson died of a heart attack on 18 May 1920 at her home, Danehill Lodge, in Lympne, Kent. She was buried at Lympne four days later.<br>
<br>Margaret Damer Dawson was blonde, blue eyed, and of delicate appearance. Although an obituarist described her as &#145;singularly unassuming&#146;, she was obviously regarded with apprehension by many male officials and magistrates. She inspired great loyalty and affection among the women who served with her. Her successor, Mary Allen, considered that the struggle against the hostility of the male police establishment had contributed to her early death.<br>
