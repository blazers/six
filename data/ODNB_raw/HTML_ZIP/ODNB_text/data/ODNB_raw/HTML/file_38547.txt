<span class="headword">Coates,  Wells Wintemute</span>  (1895&#150;1958), <span class="occ">architect and industrial designer</span>, was born on 17 December 1895 in Tokyo, Japan, the eldest of the six children of the Revd Dr Harper Havelock Coates (1865&#150;1934), Canadian-born Methodist medical missionary and professor of philosophy and comparative religion at the Aoyama Theological College in Tokyo, and his Canadian wife, Agnes Sarah Wintemute (1864&#150;1945), co-founder of one of the first missionary girls' schools in Japan. Wells Coates lived in Tokyo until he was eighteen in an austere but intellectually stimulating atmosphere of proselytizing Methodism. He was educated informally by his mother, a strong-minded woman who, when young, had trained as an architect, reputedly in the office of Louis Sullivan. An English friend of the family, G. E. L. Gauntlett, whose wife was Japanese, was Coates's intermittent tutor both in academic subjects and in such manual skills as brush drawing, paper-making and printing, boat-building, cooking, and the domestic rituals of serving food. Coates later referred to Gauntlett as &#145;the most versatile teacher I have ever known&#146;  (Cantacuzino, 11). His years in Japan nurtured his deep appreciation of everyday arts and the belief in reduction to essentials that was to be central to his architecture.<br>
<br>In 1913 Coates set out on a world cruise, with his father and Gauntlett, on the SS <i>Cleveland</i>. Already an avid and observant traveller, he kept a diary of the four months' voyage to China, Egypt, England, and finally New York, where he went up the Woolworth Building. He then enrolled at McGill University College in Vancouver, reading mechanical and structural engineering. His studies were interrupted by the First World War. He fought in the trenches in France and Belgium with the 2nd division of Canadian gunners before applying to train as a pilot with the Royal Naval Air Service. He made his maiden flight over Orl&eacute;ans and Blois on 18 July 1918, shortly before the armistice. His passion for the aeroplane was to be lifelong.<br>
<br>Coates returned to the former McGill University College, now reincorporated as part of the University of British Columbia, and took the degrees of BA in 1919 and BSc in engineering in 1922. He went to England for postgraduate studies, achieving a PhD (engineering) degree at London University in 1924 with a thesis entitled &#145;The gases of the diesel engine&#146;. His training in engineering brought particular intellectual rigour to his work in architecture and industrial design.<br>
<br>As an architect Wells Coates was a late developer. His first London job was as a journalist on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, whose proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook, favoured applications from fellow Canadians. The image of the hard-boiled journalist pounding out his story on the typewriter appealed to the raffish side in Coates. He became official science correspondent on the paper. In 1925, on a journalistic assignation in Paris, his interest was aroused in the work of Le Corbusier. Coates's London milieu was that of burgeoning modernism. He became a close friend of the architect Maxwell Fry, and in 1925, in Elsa Lanchester's nightclub the Cave of Harmony, he met Marion Grove (1906&#150;1983), then a student at the London School of Economics. They married on 5 August 1927, and in 1930 their only child, Laura, was born.<br>
<br>Coates had enormous confidence in his abilities. With no specific architectural training he took on, in 1928, the interior design of a shop in Cambridge for Crysede Silks, and then, in 1929, the internal planning of Cresta Silks' factory in Welwyn Garden City for the modernist textile entrepreneur Tom Heron, father of the painter Patrick Heron. This led to a succession of Cresta shops in glass, plywood, and steel, in which the flair and coherence of design detailing set new standards of retail design.<br>
<br>By 1930 Coates was involved in discussions that led to his best-known and most influential project, Lawn Road Flats in Hampstead. He was fortunate in finding like-minded clients. The concept of a large-scale block of service flats for modern professional people was developed in collaboration with Jack Pritchard, one of Britain's few committed patrons of modernist architecture and design, and his wife, Molly, a psychotherapist. A new company, Isokon, was formed to build the flats, the name being derived from the term isometric unit construction. Each Isokon flat was equipped by Coates with purpose-designed minimal furniture and fittings; meals and laundry were to be provided centrally. The reinforced concrete Lawn Road Flats, completed in 1934, were socially experimental. As Coates wrote in an article in <span class="italic">The Listener</span> (24 May 1933), &#145;We cannot burden ourselves with permanent tangible possessions, as well as with our real new possessions of freedom, travel and experience.&#146; Coates's flats became a gathering point for the Hampstead avant-garde. The Bauhaus &eacute;migr&eacute;s Marcel Breuer, Walter Gropius, and L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy were early residents. Nikolaus Pevsner looked back on Lawn Road Flats as &#145;giant's work of the 1930s&#146;  (Pritchard, 98). Their place in the history of the modern movement in Britain is significant.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s Coates had been emerging as a leader of the British modernists. He was a founder member of two important groups which stood for the &#145;contemporary spirit&#146;: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96310', "Unit One")</script>, an association of painters, sculptors, and architects, and the more specifically architectural MARS Group. Coates invented the title, which stood for Modern Architectural Research Group. MARS was the British branch of the Congr&egrave;s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) and Coates attended CIAM's famous Athens Charter meeting in July 1933, where he conferred with Le Corbusier and other leading European architects.<br>
<br>While Lawn Road Flats was under construction, Coates was commissioned to design the interior of the new BBC studios in Portland Place in association with Raymond McGrath and Serge Chermayeff. His BBC news studios and special effects studios show his high skills of logical planning and technical inventiveness. His fascination with new forms and new materials made him a superlative product designer. A twelve-year association with Ecko, manufacturers of wireless sets and electric fires, began in 1932 with the AD 65, Coates's circular wireless in Bakelite which became a design icon of its time.<br>
<br>The interior in which Coates's vision of &#145;new habits of life&#146; was most apparent was the studio flat at 18 Yeoman's Row in London, where he lived from 1935 to 1955. The oriental influence is obvious in this practical, serene, pared-down living&#150;working space with its large, low cushions and Japanese matting spread over rubber flooring, in which Coates himself, dressed in his kaftan, dispensing hospitality, was integral to the <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>.<br>
<br>Most of Coates's realized buildings in the 1930s were for luxury living. Embassy Court Flats (1935), an eleven-storey block on the sea front at Hove, was designed with verandas and sun terraces to give its wealthy residents maximum exposure to sea air. The more structurally interesting Palace Gate Flats in Kensington (1939) put into practice Coates's ideas for &#145;planning in section&#146;. Hampden Nursery School in Holland Park (1936) was a &#145;total design&#146; concept, in the vanguard of progressive educational ideas.<br>
<br>But Coates's main ambitions lay in revolutionary mass housing. He pursued ingenious schemes for prefabricated structures, beginning with the two-storey Sunspan House first shown at the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition in Olympia in 1934. During the Second World War he was transferred from the RAF to advise the Aircraft Industries Research Organization on Housing (AIROH), evolving the sectional unit AIROH aluminium house. The government put 75,000 into production, one complete house being produced every ten minutes in four transportable sections. After the war Coates remained a consultant to AIROH, designing a two-decker, three-unit, three-bedroom house for an associated company, and investigating needs for low-cost housing among the poorest populations of South America, proposing a series of experimental aluminium dwellings. Neither of these designs was ever manufactured. Simultaneously with the AIROH house, Coates developed his most potentially revolutionary scheme for standardized, prefabricated, lightweight, mobile room units, interchangeable from one site to another. He described them as &#145;Rooms in a Garden&#146; and &#145;Rooms in a Frame&#146;. His failure to find financial backing was a bitter disappointment to him.<br>
<br>In 1944 Wells Coates was appointed OBE (military class) for services to the RAF, and was elected a royal designer for industry. One might have expected his career to burgeon in post-war Britain. But apart from the Telekinema for the Festival of Britain, none of his many projects reached fruition at this period. His greatly admired boat designs&#151;the Wingsail Catamaran cruising yacht (1948) and the &#145;Fey Loong&#146; yawl (1954)&#151;were finally abandoned. In the early 1950s his visionary plan for a mixed-development Canadian new town at Iroquois on the St Lawrence River was rejected in favour of a cheaper scheme.<br>
<br>Coates's life was in some ways a tragic one. He suffered from depressions, which appear to have intensified after the macabre death, in 1926, of his friend Alfred Borgeaud, who fell from the train in British Columbia on which they were both travelling. Coates retrieved and buried the mangled remains. After the early failure of his marriage, ending in divorce in 1937, his emotional life was in perpetual disarray. He was bad at managing finance, and his arrogance and tactlessness antagonized all but the most forgiving of his clients. But Wells Coates's extraordinary talent has never been in doubt. He left Britain a legacy of heroic modernism, of which his one-time assistant Denys Lasdun was main heir.<br>
<br>In 1955 he departed for Harvard University, where, from 1955 to 1956, he was visiting professor of architecture and urban design. In 1956 he returned to Vancouver, where he worked on abortive projects for the redevelopment of the downtown city and a mass rapid transit system of his own invention, the Monospan Twin-Ride. A heart attack in 1957 was followed by another on 17 June 1958, when he died on Vancouver beach at English Bay after bathing and picnicking with friends. He was cremated a week later in Vancouver.<br>
