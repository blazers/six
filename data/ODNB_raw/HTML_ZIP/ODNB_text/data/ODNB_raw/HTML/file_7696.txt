<span class="headword">Dixon,  George</span>  (1748?&#150;1795), <span class="occ">naval officer and fur trader</span>, was born in Kirkoswald, Cumberland; further details of his upbringing are unknown, though he did practise as a jeweller before going to sea. He served as a petty officer and armourer in the <i>Discovery</i> during James Cook's last voyage in 1776 and appears later to have had the command of a merchant ship. Dixon, always interested in the search for the north-west passage, wrote to Sir Joseph Banks in August 1784, urging the overland exploration of Canada from Quebec to the north-west coast of North America. In May 1785 he was engaged by the King George's Sound Company (headed by Richard Cadman Etches) for the development and prosecution of the fur trade of the north-west coast. Dixon was appointed to command the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> and sailed from Gravesend on 29 August 1785 in company with the <i>King George</i>, whose captain, Nathaniel Portlock, had been his shipmate in the <i>Resolution</i> and was now the commander of the expedition. Having doubled Cape Horn and touched at the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands, they sailed from there on 13 June 1786; on 18 July they reached the coast of North America, near the mouth of Cook Inlet, in latitude 59&deg; N. They remained there for several weeks and then worked their way south towards King George's Sound (Nootka Sound), off which they were on 24 September. Prevented from entering the sound by baffling winds and calms they returned to the Sandwich Islands, where they wintered.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1787 the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> and the <i>King George</i> again sailed for the north-west coast of North America, and on 24 April they anchored off Montague Island. Here on 14 May Dixon's ship separated from the <i>King George</i>, it being considered more likely to lead to profitable results if the two worked independently. During the next three months Dixon was employed as far south as Nootka Sound (in mid-August), purchasing sea otter pelts from the Haida, taking eager note of Native American manners and customs, as well as of the trade facilities, and making a careful survey of the several points which came within his reach. James Cook had already denoted the general outline of the coast but the detail was still wanting, much of which Dixon now provided. Of these additions the most important was the large archipelago that he named Queen Charlotte Islands and later described as having surpassed &#145;our most sanguine expectations, and afforded a greater quantity of furs than perhaps any place hitherto known&#146;  (<span class="italic">Voyage Round the World</span>, 235). Though he sighted and named Queen Charlotte Sound, Dixon failed to discover that it was a southward passage. Since the first object of the voyage was trade, and as the Queen Charlotte Islands seemed to more than answer immediate wants, Dixon was perhaps careless of further discoveries and, &#145;while claiming to have made considerable additions to the geography of this coast&#146;, he contented himself with the remark that:<blockquote>so imperfectly do we still know it that it is in some measure to be doubted whether we have yet seen the mainland. Certain it is that the coast abounds with islands, but whether any land we have been near is really the continent remains to be determined by future navigators. (ibid., 235&#150;6)</blockquote>An examination of Dixon's chart shows in fact that most of his work lay among the islands.<br>
<br>On leaving Nootka Sound the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> returned to the Sandwich Islands, whence she sailed on 18 September for China, where it had been agreed that she was to meet her consort. On 9 November she anchored at Macau, and at Whampoa (Huangpu) on 25 November she was joined by the <i>King George</i>. There they sold their furs, of which the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> had a particularly good cargo. Having taken on board a shipment of tea they dropped down to Macau, and on 9 February 1788 they sailed for England. In bad weather off the Cape of Good Hope the ships parted company and, though they met again at St Helena, they then sailed independently. The <i>Queen Charlotte</i> arrived off Dover on 17 September, having been preceded by the <i>King George</i> by about a fortnight.<br>
<br>When a rival trader and explorer, John Meares, published an account of his voyages of 1788 and 1789 Dixon wrote a pamphlet criticizing its many inaccuracies and false claims to priority of discovery. There followed a brief pamphlet exchange, from which Dixon emerged victorious. Thereafter he continued to advise politicians and promoters of British discoveries on the possibility of finding a north-west passage. Aspects of his later life are obscure. He may have taught navigation at Gosport and he may be the author of <span class="italic">The Navigator's Assistant</span> (1791). Previously, in 1789, Dixon had published, with Portlock, <span class="italic">A Voyage Round the World; but More Particularly to the North-West Coast of America</span>; aside from the introduction and appendix the text was actually written by the supercargo of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, William Beresford. Dixon's final years were spent in St George, Bermuda, where he arrived from New York with his family in February 1794; there Dixon opened a jewellery shop. His wife Anne died soon after (and was buried on 20 May 1794). Dixon returned briefly to London but died, and was buried, at St George in November 1795.<br>
