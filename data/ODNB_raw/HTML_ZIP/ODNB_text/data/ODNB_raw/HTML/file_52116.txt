<span class="headword">Hogarth,  Ann</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Margaret Ann Gildart Jackson; <em>married name </em>Margaret Ann Gildart Bussell]</span>  (1910&#150;1993), <span class="occ">puppet-master</span>, was born on 19 July 1910 at Hazelgrove, Shottermill, Frensham, Surrey, the fourth of the five children of William Gildart Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1937/8), a retired schoolmaster, and his wife, Olive Mary Howle. Her mother died when she was two, and she was brought up mainly by her stepmother. Encouraged by winning prizes for public speaking at St Catherine's School, Bramley, she resolved to become an actress and, after ensuring her future by obtaining secretarial qualifications, she studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She then became stage manager at the experimental Players' Theatre, London. The producer there was <a name="cosubject_76082"></a><span class="headword">John Garrett <span class="st"> [Jan]</span> Bussell</span>  (1909&#150;1985). Born at 239 Woodstock Road, Oxford, on 20 July 1909, he was the eldest of the three children of John Garrett Bussell (1883&#150;1915), clergyman and schoolmaster, and his wife, Dorothea Bickerton (1885&#150;1962). His father was killed in action at Ypres when Jan was six. His mother encouraged his early passion for model theatre productions and was amused rather than annoyed by his defection from Brasenose College, Oxford, to join Edward Stirling's English Players in France. On his return to London he met Waldo Lanchester and Harry W. Whanslaw, then running the London Marionette Theatre, and there he served his apprenticeship as a puppeteer. He was instrumental in securing a booking for the London Marionette Theatre with John Logie Baird, who was experimenting with television. Their performance of Pirandello's <span class="italic">The Man with the Flower in his Mouth</span> was in 1931 one of the first puppet productions to be transmitted. At the Players' Theatre he met Ann Hogarth, and in 1932 they set up their own puppet company, the Hogarth Puppets. The couple married on 23 March 1933 and spent their honeymoon camping and touring the Cotswolds with the Hogarth Puppets. They did everything themselves, booking the church halls, advertising, carrying scenery and puppets, selling tickets, showing people to their seats, and finally performing their puppet circus show, billed as &#145;One and a half hours of scintillating entertainment!&#146; There followed more and more complex productions, and fifty years of touring both in Britain and around the world.<br>
<br>The Bussells felt that it was the excellence of the acting that was unique to British puppetry; so having begun with circus and variety, they widened their repertory to include scenes from <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, poetry, and operetta. They wrote and commissioned plays and ballets especially for puppets. A ballet based on the life of a rose was an early success. There were many musical items, including a whole burlesque orchestra, and shadow puppets were also introduced. Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">Happy Prince</span>, cut in silhouette by their friend Lotte Reiniger, was particularly outstanding. Abstract figures were made and shown successfully, but it was the versatile voices of their puppets and their dramatic ability that made for a close rapport with their audiences. The shows always had panache, pace, and professionalism.<br>
<br>At first puppets were just a &#145;paying hobby&#146;. Jan was employed as the director of Sheffield Repertory Theatre and then joined the BBC in Manchester as a regional producer of radio programmes. He transferred to television at Alexandra Palace as a drama producer in 1936&#151;pioneering times&#151;until the war came and he joined the navy. This was when he started to write; he eventually published three autobiographical books&#151;<span class="italic">The Puppets and I</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Puppet's Progress</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Through Wooden Eyes</span> (1956)&#151;as well as books about puppet theatre production and plays.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1946 Muffin the Mule made his d&eacute;but on <span class="italic">For the Children</span> and became the first star made by British television. The fifteen-minute programmes, in black and white, were transmitted &#145;live&#146; from Alexandra Palace and later from Lime Grove Studios at 5 p.m. on alternate Sundays for eight years. The marionette characters and their charming human partner, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65429/', "Annette Mills")</script>, delighted young and old. Muffin received an enormous fan mail and more carrots than anyone could eat. Ann worked all the puppets, devised the shows, and wrote the scripts and many of the books that spread his fame. Annette Mills, sister of Sir John Mills, was Muffin's presenter. She interpreted the puppets' mime and composed the special songs to which they danced while she sang and played the piano. The lid of her grand piano made their stage. Jan made Muffin's first friends: intelligent but cross Peregrine the Penguin, coy Louise the Lamb, and sweet, stupid Oswald the Ostrich. Eventually more friends were added. Tours in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa brought Katy the Kangaroo, Kirri the Kiwi, and Zebbie the Zebra, all made by Stanley Maile, a brilliant puppet designer first met at the London Marionette Theatre. Muffin was originally commissioned from Fred Tickner (a famous carver of Punch puppets) to be part of a circus act, but after Annette picked him and christened him, Ann invented a whole new life for him as a naughty schoolboy, and children, new to &#145;the magic of television&#146;, thought he was alive. Replicas of Muffin can be found in London, Moscow, and New York, and a Royal Mail stamp was issued in 1996. A new fan club, the Muffin the Mule Collectors' Club, was set up in 2000. Muffin himself passed to Sally, the Bussells' only child, who grew up with Muffin and must always have influenced his career more than she knew. When Annette Mills died in 1955, the BBC said goodbye to Muffin, but he continued his career in theatre, films, and books. His last appearance was as comp&egrave;re to a BBC documentary <span class="italic">The Lime Grove Story</span> in 1991. Ann was then over eighty, but had lost none of her skills, and Muffin was as young and cheeky as ever.<br>
<br>The Hogarth Puppets toured the world, playing West End theatres, the outback of Australia, and the ice caps of Canada. Jan served for two terms as president of the Union Internationale de la Marionnette, which unites the puppet companies of over eighty countries, and the Bussells welcomed many foreign puppeteers to their home. They taught two apprentices and gave generously of their time to help other puppeteers. In summer they toured the many parks of London with their caravan and tent theatres, giving pleasure to countless children. But their versatility was such that they could also provide the puppets and puppetry for Falla's opera <span class="italic">Master Peter's Puppet Show</span> for festival audiences and gain excellent reviews. It was with the Glyndebourne production team that they produced a large-scale marionette version of <span class="italic">The Water Babies</span>, which was later restaged by the National Puppet Theatre of Australia. This was the show which inspired larger productions in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s, but only after annual grant aid was made available for other puppet theatres to follow in the pioneering footsteps of the Hogarth Puppets.<br>
<br>When the Bussells retired from performing to Devon they set up an international exhibition of puppets, showing all the figures they had collected and been given during their travels. This is now owned by the Puppet Centre Trust in London and is regularly on display. Jan Bussell died on 23 April 1985, and Ann moved to Budleigh Salterton to be near her daughter and family. She found old age and living alone very frustrating, but was much loved and respected for her sensible criticisms of the next generation's puppet shows. She died at a nursing home, Links Pinewood House, Victoria Place, Budleigh Salterton, on 9 April 1993 and was cremated in Exeter on 17 April.<br>
<br>Ann Hogarth and Jan Bussell were leaders of their profession. Their talent and friendship influenced puppeteers and audiences worldwide, and Muffin the Mule, just one of their many delightful puppets, became a national institution.<br>
