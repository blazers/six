<span class="headword">Nicholson,  Charles Ernest</span>  (1868&#150;1954), <span class="occ">yacht designer</span>, was born at Gosport on 12 May 1868, the second son in the family of three boys and five girls of Benjamin Nicholson, naval architect, and his wife, Sarah Watson. Educated at Mill Hill School, he joined the family firm of Camper and Nicholsons Ltd in 1886 and at the age of twenty-one became the firm's chief designer, a post which he filled until his death. Later, he was chairman and managing director, to the age of seventy-two. In 1895 he married Lucy Ella (<i>d</i>. 1937), daughter of William Edmonds, a solicitor. They had two daughters and three sons, the second of whom, John, followed his father in the firm and became chairman in 1940.<br>
<br>Nicholson rapidly made his presence felt in the firm and soon sailing yachts of all kinds from his board were challenging those of G. L. Watson, the acknowledged master of the time. Nicholson, a rare combination of artist, technical genius, and businessman, was undoubtedly one of the greatest and most versatile yacht architects of all time. His skill as a helmsman contributed in no small measure to his success. He built up the greatest yacht yard in this country at Gosport and later a second at Southampton. Both had difficulty in keeping pace with the designs of yachts of all conceivable kinds which flowed in a steady torrent from his imaginative brain.<br>
<br>Nicholson designed sailing craft of all sizes from a 12 foot dinghy for his grandchildren to J-class America's Cup challengers of which he built four, notably <i>Shamrock IV</i> in 1914 and <i>Endeavour</i> in 1934, both potential winners; that they failed to win the cup was due to extraneous circumstances and no fault of Nicholson's. In 1939, which marked the end of the pageant of big-class yacht racing, the 12 metre fleet was almost entirely of Nicholson's design and construction. By the mid-thirties ocean racing was becoming popular and inevitably Nicholson was commissioned to design and build a suitable vessel. Not limited by cost, he produced the cutter <i>Foxhound</i> in 1935, 45 feet on the waterline, about the same size as a 12 metre. Nothing comparable had been built in this country. She was followed by the yawl <i>Bloodhound</i> and <i>Stiarna</i>, a cutter, of similar design. These yachts were highly successful and throughout long careers stood up to the hard punishment of offshore racing; and, in the 1960s, were still in commission, <i>Bloodhound</i> being then owned until 1969 by Elizabeth II and the duke of Edinburgh. Nicholson designed cruising yachts of all kinds from 5 tons up to such vessels as the 699 ton schooner <i>Creole</i> (1927).<br>
<br>Nicholson was always a jump ahead. He was the first yacht designer to see the possibilities of Bermuda rig and in 1921 re-rigged the 23 metre <i>Nyria</i>, which he had designed and built in 1906, with a jib-headed mainsail. This brought a storm of derision characteristically and rightly ignored by Nicholson. She proved a great success and revolutionized the rig of all modern yachts.<br>
<br>In between the sailing vessels came steam and motor yachts, enough of them alone to constitute a man's life-work. About 1911 Nicholson produced two beautiful traditional clipper-stem steam yachts, <i>Marynthea</i> (900 tons) and <i>Miranda</i>. He then turned his attention to diesel yachts, the first being <i>Pioneer</i> (400 tons), and, in 1937, <i>Philante</i> (1612 tons), the largest motor yacht until then built in Britain. She later became the Norwegian royal yacht. These fine vessels were of a type quite different from the traditional steam yacht. Entirely &#145;Nicholson&#146; in conception, they were excellent sea boats, with fine accommodation and a wide radius of action.<br>
<br>In the First World War, as a separate venture, Nicholson designed and built flying-boat hulls in wood. In the same period he formed, as a separate firm, the Laminated Wood Ship Company, to design and build wooden cargo vessels of 1000 tons dead weight to help the urgent need for tonnage to replace losses due to enemy submarine action. The method of construction was original, based on a longitudinal system of framing with multi-skin planking and deck, and planned to use home-grown timbers such as oak, fir, and larch. Some of these ships were still in commission many years after the war. As a further example of his versatility, Nicholson designed a training ship, <i>Sebastian de Elcano</i> (3000 tons), for the Spanish government. She was a fore-and-aft four-masted schooner. The drawings included the minutest detail so that she could be built in Spain.<br>
<br>Nicholson's vast output was due not only to his tremendous capacity for concentrated thought and work but also to his ability and judgement in gathering to work under him a team of men each an expert in his own sphere. Unfortunately for students of Nicholson's work most of his drawings and plans were burned in a fire at the works in 1910 and again in 1941 when the yard at Gosport was virtually destroyed by enemy action. Fortunately Beken's matchless photographs are still available.<br>
<br>Nicholson was the technical brain of the Yacht Racing Association from 1910 until the outbreak of war in 1939. He was also a member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. In 1944 he was awarded the diploma of royal designer for industry and in 1949 he was appointed OBE. Throughout his life he devoted much time to the Gosport War Memorial Hospital of which he became chairman in 1934; in that year he was made the first honorary freeman of the borough of Gosport. Nicholson died at his home at Faringdon, Hill Head, Hampshire, on 27 February 1954.<br>
