</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McCulloch,  John Ramsay</span>  (1789&#150;1864), <span class="occ">political economist</span>, was born on 1 March 1789, in Whithorn, Wigtownshire, the eldest of two sons of William McCulloch and of Sarah, daughter of the Revd James Laing DD, minister of the parish of Glasserton. The family owned the freehold of a small estate, Auchengool, in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and when John Ramsay was five years old, William McCulloch died, a year before his own father, upon which Sarah's father took charge of their home and property and assumed guardianship of the two boys. Sarah herself escaped from her father's domination by marrying a cousin, Dr David Dempster, but it was not until sixteen-year-old John Ramsay formally inherited Auchengool, together with his father's house and small farm in Whithorn, that he and his brother went to live with their mother and stepfather. Although Dr Laing pursued until 1809 his litigious endeavours to dispute John Ramsay's inheritance, the latter (according to H. G. Reid, his biographer, son-in-law, and personal assistant) was to recall his maternal grandfather gratefully, in later years, as a good classical scholar with a taste for modern as well as ancient literature, whose well-stocked library nourished his youthful passion for books.<h2>
<a name="Earlyinterestinpoliticaleconomy"></a>Early interest in political economy</h2>In October 1807, after moving with the Dempsters to Edinburgh, McCulloch entered the university there, where he studied various subjects (including mathematics, agriculture, and metaphysics); there is no evidence, however, that he attended Dugald Stewart's lectures in political economy. He left without graduating, returned in August 1811 to his house in Whithorn, and on 12 November of that year married Isabella Stewart. He then took employment in Edinburgh as a lawyer's clerk and it was there that he became interested in political economy. In 1815 he wrote his first <span class="italic">Essay on the Question of Reducing the Interest of the National Debt</span>, which he boldly sent to David Ricardo for comment. The 27-year-old was rewarded for his temerity in addressing the leading British political economist of the day by receiving a generously full critical comment on his <span class="italic">Essay</span>. A few months later he sent Ricardo a much enlarged and duly revised edition of the pamphlet&#151;which did not altogether accept the master's critique. By the time Ricardo's classic <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> was published McCulloch had joined the staff of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, a new liberal newspaper for which he reviewed the book in May 1817. More significant, however, in establishing his early reputation as a well-informed economic journalist, in close touch with recent thinking on political economy, was the substantial review article on Ricardo's <span class="italic">Principles</span> that was McCulloch's first contribution to the influential <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (June 1818). He remained that journal's principal economic writer for almost twenty years and was regarded by himself, and his contemporaries&#151;including Ricardo&#151;as the latter's principal popularizer.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithDavidRicardo"></a>Relations with David Ricardo</h2>By the end of 1818 McCulloch had published more than fifty articles on current politico-economic themes&#151;mainly in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span> (of which he was editor from 1817 to 1821) or the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>&#151;and had written two of the twenty major articles he was to contribute to the 6th, 7th, and 8th editions of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and its supplements. He was then sending Ricardo first drafts or proofs of his articles and getting back both constructive advice and warm encouragement. Moreover, after Ricardo took his seat as an MP, early in 1819, McCulloch had no hesitation either in using him to extract from other MPs or officials factual data and perspectives relevant to his current journalistic projects, or in urging him to speak in Commons debates on issues of special concern to politically minded Scots. Over the next four to five years the congenial, often lengthy, argumentative letters passing between these two seekers after truth in the new science of political economy created a professional relationship valued by each of them. They first met in May 1823, when McCulloch visited London to spend six weeks in lively discussion with Ricardo and his circle and participated in a meeting of the Political Economy Club. This was after he had already delivered the third of his annual course of lectures to Edinburgh students&#151;to an audience that reached sixty in early 1823. A cordial letter from Ricardo, which arrived after McCulloch's return home, anticipated his next London visit, the following year, to give a similar course which ought to prove instructive to &#145;some of the grown gentlemen in the House of Commons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works and Correspondence</span>, 9.301). However, Ricardo died two months later. So, although McCulloch did return to London (in April 1824) to lecture to an audience that included government ministers and MPs, it was James Mill and his friends who had raised the funds to endow a Ricardo memorial lectureship on political economy for ten years and ensured that McCulloch would be the first incumbent.<h2>
<a name="ProfessorinLondon"></a>Professor in London</h2>The Ricardo Memorial Lectures were so successful that in the first year McCulloch was persuaded to repeat them in Liverpool in the autumn of 1824. In 1825 and 1826 his London audiences (at times including such eminent dignitaries as the chancellor of the exchequer, the president of the Board of Trade, and the lord mayor) were so large that he gave twenty-six lectures, twice weekly, at a City as well as a West End location&#151;supplementing them with private classes in his own rooms for the more earnest of his regular listeners. He also gave occasional one-off lectures, one of which&#151;a discourse delivered at the opening of the City of London Literary and Scientific Institution&#151;was said to have attracted nearly 800 auditors. In spite of his fame as a teacher of political economy in London, McCulloch's friends failed in their campaign to establish an Edinburgh chair in the subject, for which they saw him as the best-qualified candidate. The reason was that, during his years as an outspoken editor of <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, he had made a bitter enemy of (among others) John Wilson, Dugald Stewart's successor in the chair of moral philosophy, who though totally without interest in, or knowledge of, political economy, could (and did) claim it as being within his own professorial brief. McCulloch had not yet affronted influential Londoners, however, when he was offered, and in 1828 accepted, the chair of political economy in the newly founded University of London. It proved a disappointing episode in his career. After buying an expensive house in fashionable Fitzroy Square, he quarrelled continuously with the university council (mainly about money matters, but also on educational issues) and was confronted by dwindling student audiences. Money was, of course, a pressing consideration for a middle-aged man who took his family responsibilities seriously. Isabella bore him twelve children, of whom four boys (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17414/', "William McCulloch")</script>) and six girls survived, and McCulloch was anxious to add to the small return generated by his Scottish properties a basic salary of the kind attached to public office. He vacated the London University chair in 1837, and eventually, in 1838, he was appointed comptroller of the Stationery Office at a salary of &pound;600 per annum, which rose gradually to &pound;1200 in 1854. There he gained a deserved reputation among government ministers for his vigorous efforts to cut the costs of paper and printing in government offices&#151;tempered by a humane consideration for those members of his staff who faced personal financial crises. According to the obituary published in the 1864 <span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, McCulloch's economy drive achieved annual savings that &#145;far exceeded the cost of the department he presided over&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 196).<h2>
<a name="Thefirstprofessionaleconomist"></a>The first professional economist</h2>Meanwhile McCulloch continued to justify Ricardo's assessment of him as a &#145;zealous advocate for the correct principles of political economy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works and Correspondence</span>, 9.155). He was arguably the first professional economist. He published a steady stream of seriously researched and lucidly expounded articles, pamphlets, and books. From 1820 (when he first offered private classes in political economy to Edinburgh students) to 1837, when he left his London chair, he was also a conscientious lecturer in the subject. As early as 1822 his reputation was such that he was invited to write the first substantive article on political economy to appear in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. As usual, he submitted it for Ricardo's approval and was duly encouraged by the latter's response: &#145;Besides a valuable historical sketch, you have given so clear an exposition of all the important principles of the science that you have left nothing for me to wish for&#146;  (ibid., 9.275). This was the article that McCulloch expanded into his popular textbook, <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy, with a Sketch of the Rise and Progress of the Science</span> (1825), which went through five editions. Apart from a best-selling annotated edition of Adam Smith's <span class="italic">Wealth of Nations</span> (1828) and a (less successful) edition of David Ricardo's works (1845), he also produced the first systematic account of the theory and policy of public finance: <span class="italic">Treatise on the Principles and Practical Influence of Taxation and the Funding System</span> (1845).<br>
<br>McCulloch reached an even wider audience, however, and added substantially to his annual income with his three statistical reference books, of which the most financially rewarding was his <span class="italic">Dictionary, Practical, Theoretical, and Historical of Commerce and Commercial Navigation</span> (1832), a virtually single-handed work which he revised, expanded, and updated nine times. These &#145;dictionaries&#146; were not simply compilations of statistical and other facts; for McCulloch was a pioneer in critical assessment and analytical treatment of economic information he gathered from a variety of public and private sources. None of his contemporaries, for example, was better informed or more outspoken on the deficiencies of the broad range of official statistics then available. The many journalists, public officials, MPs, and government ministers who used his figures to buttress their arguments and policy recommendations had no excuse for ignoring the fragility of the basic data. At the same time, this most prolific author was an avid reader. Few, if any, writers on economic matters had read so widely and so exhaustively on the science and substance of their subject&#151;as effectively illustrated by his 400-page bibliography <span class="italic">Literature of Political Economy</span> (1845). Nor did he confine his reading to economic questions. A keen bibliophile, McCulloch built up a valuable library of over 10,000 books which, after his death, his friend Lord Overstone bought for &pound;5000.<h2>
<a name="Reputationanddeath"></a>Reputation and death</h2>Although McCulloch's association with Ricardo and his circle helped to enhance his early reputation as an expert in the new science of political economy, it seems to have obscured, until recently, his distinctive qualities as an applied economist for later historians of economic thought. The fact is that McCulloch was never converted to the Ricardian abstract style of theorizing&#151;even during the three years before Ricardo's death, when their eager exchange of views and information was at its peak. McCulloch's own interest in political economy stemmed always from his immediate concern with questions of practical policy. He judged economic theories in terms of their usefulness when applied to urgent current problems. As he continued to address a widening range of contemporary economic problems and to amass the relevant statistics and other data, and as he continually revised and updated his <span class="italic">Principles</span> in the light of experience, his divergence from the orthodox Ricardian model became increasingly obvious. In his own time he was probably more famous, more widely read by those engaged in making or debating economic policy, and more often singled out for attack by critics of the &#145;dismal science&#146; than any other economist. Although Sir Robert Peel, for example, had crucially failed in 1825 to support the claim for a separate chair of political economy in Edinburgh, he was frankly impressed in the 1830s by McCulloch's views on public finance, and in 1846 he was to acknowledge his services to the science of political economy by getting him an annual state pension of &pound;200. McCulloch was by then internationally famous. His <span class="italic">Principles</span> was a familiar text for American undergraduates and was translated into French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian. In 1843 he was elected a foreign associate of the Institut de France. Evidently this early example of a professional economist was a public personality in his own time. The obituary in <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, for example, referred to his &#145;great sagacity and manly commonsense&#146; as well as to &#145;an independence of judgment that occasionally revelled in arbitrary assertion and cherished prejudice&#146;, and went on to notice &#145;something almost Johnsonian in his intellectual aspect and style&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>, 13 Nov 1864).<br>
<br>On the other hand, given McCulloch's eclectic use of economic theory, and his dauntingly large output of articles, pamphlets, and books, realistically (if often repetitiously) focused on a variety of specific nineteenth-century problems, subsequent commentators have found it hard to put his contribution into perspective and have tended to underrate him&#151;at least until Professor O'Brien's comprehensive account and evaluation of his work as a whole was published in 1970. It is now apparent that for most of the half-century preceding his death this hard-working, largely self-educated Scot did more than any other economist of his day to introduce the new science of political economy to an interested public. In particular, for example, although McCulloch neither invented nor developed the classical wage-fund theory, he used it to such effect that, according to Joseph Schumpeter, &#145;he established himself as the leading exponent of the wage-fund doctrine&#146;  (J. A. Schumpeter, <span class="italic">History of Economic Analysis</span>, 1955, 669). He continued to keep in touch with new thinking on economic affairs, not only by reading voraciously, but also by exchanging ideas and arguments with other economists&#151;for example at the London Political Economy Club, where he participated regularly from 1839 to 1852 and made many good friends. His distinctive technique was to marry to current economic data theories developed by such leaders in classical political economy as Smith, Hume, or Ricardo and to furnish the analysis with insights arising out of his own interpretation of recent economic events, or borrowed from friends (such as the banker Lord Overstone) who were themselves active agents in crucial decision-making processes.<br>
<br>McCulloch was still working on an 11th edition of his <span class="italic">Commercial Dictionary</span>, and still in charge of HM Stationery Office in Prince Street, Westminster, when he died there (of the chronic bronchitis that had afflicted him for most of his life) on 11 November 1864. He was buried a week later in Brompton cemetery, where Isabella&#151;to whom he had been happily married for fifty-three years&#151;was laid beside him three years later.<br>
