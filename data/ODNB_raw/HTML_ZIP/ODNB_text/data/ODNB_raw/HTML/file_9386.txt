<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Field,  Henry</span>  (1755&#150;1837), <span class="occ">apothecary</span>, was born on 29 September 1755 at Woodford, Essex, the first-born of eleven children (two of whom died in infancy) of John Field (1718/19&#150;1796), apothecary and founder in 1765 of the London Annuity Society for the Benefit of Widows of Members, and his wife, Anne (1730/31&#150;1797), daughter of Thomas Cromwell, wholesale provisions merchant and sugar refiner of Snow Hill, later of Bridgewater Square, in the City of London, and his first wife, Frances (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Tidman). His great-grandfather was Henry, lord lieutenant of Ireland and the fourth son of the protector, Oliver Cromwell. Field's parents both came from nonconformist families with long-established connections with Hertfordshire. The thriving practice which his grandfather John Field (<i>d</i>. 1740) had built up in Newgate Street in the City passed to the oldest son of each of the next three generations. John Field the younger took over in 1754, Henry in 1786, and Henry Cromwell in 1809. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9397/', "William Field (1768&#150;1851)")</script> was his brother.<br>
<br>Apprenticed to his father on 3 October 1769 for seven years, Henry Field qualified and was made free of the Society of Apothecaries by patrimony on 5 November 1776. He rose through its ranks to become master in 1825&#150;6, and he donated &pound;50 to the society's Widows' Fund on completing his term of office. Thereafter he was frequently official deputy for many masters and wardens until the year of his death, in 1837. Field married Esther (1759&times;64&#150;1834), daughter of John Barron of Woolacre House, near Deptford, Kent, on 2 September 1784 at St Paul's, Deptford. Their ten children (seven sons and three daughters) were all baptized in Haberdashers' Hall Independent Chapel, Staining Lane, City of London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9381/', "Barron Field (1786&#150;1846)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9383/', "Frederick Field (1801&#150;1885)")</script> were their sons.<br>
<br>In 1798 Field was elected to the Friendly (later Friendly Medical) Society of the Society of Apothecaries, an &eacute;litist, social, dining club. He prompted and jointly chaired its centenary celebrations, a dinner with speeches at the Star and Garter on Richmond Hill, and by 1830 he was accorded the title of &#145;father&#146;. Pleading infirmity he resigned on 11 December 1837, only to be unanimously elected an honorary member. A director from 1800 of one of the society's two pharmaceutical stock companies, whose customers included the navy, the army, and the East India Company, Field became deputy treasurer of the society's &#145;trade&#146; from 1815 until 1827. He was then re-elected treasurer of the United Stock annually until his death. The company commissioned Henry William Pickersgill RA to paint his portrait &#145;in testimony of the very long, faithful and valuable services of their Treasurer&#146;, and the work was presented to the society in 1832 (plaque in the Court Room, Apothecaries' Hall).<br>
<br>With Joseph Hurlock, Field conducted free, pioneering lectures (with demonstrations) on materia medica to the apprentices at the hall between 1803 and 1808 and initiated examinations for prizes, which were awarded until 1895. An active campaigner for medical reform and a founder member in 1812 of the original committee of the Association of Apothecaries and Surgeon-Apothecaries of England and Wales, Field and his colleagues saw their efforts rewarded by the passing of the <span class="roman">Apothecaries' Act</span> of 1815. This empowered the society to institute a court of examiners to examine and grant licences to successful candidates intending to practise as apothecaries in England and Wales. Field was an examiner from 1815 until 1823, excepting 1817, the year he was elected onto the court of assistants. He served on countless committees thereafter. In 1818, at the court's behest, Field updated a history of the society begun by his father. Together with his interest in medical botany and pharmacy, this may have motivated him to write an account of the Chelsea Physic Garden (established by the society in 1673), which the court then printed and distributed to every freeman of the society. Field's reputation became such that, in 1831, Sir Henry Halford appointed him one of the four expert medical advisers to the City of London board of health to handle the threat of a cholera epidemic in the metropolis. The corporation of London later awarded him a large silver epergne which, with his painting of Henry Cromwell, he bequeathed to his second son, Barron. On 11 February 1835 Field delivered an address (which was also printed and circulated by the court) to the first of the society's evening meetings, tracing the history of the art of the apothecary.<br>
<br>On 23 January 1807 Henry Field had been elected by a massive majority to the office of apothecary to Christ's Hospital, London, receiving ninety-six votes, seventy more than his nearest rival. The appointment commanded a salary of &pound;200 and compulsory residence in the school grounds. Field remained in post until 24 July 1835, and his many responsibilities included requisitioning supplies of top-quality drugs and medicines from Apothecaries' Hall where, from 1808, he was a director of both the Laboratory and the Navy Stock companies (the United Stock was formed by their merger in 1822). He inherited his sense of history, his philanthropic purpose, and his business acumen from his father, and served as treasurer of the London Annuity Society for several decades until his death. In 1836 Samuel Lane was commissioned to paint Field's portrait for its Court Room. Field resigned in July 1835 having lingered at Christ's Hospital rather longer than was perhaps wise. A clergyman, whose son had died, had brought an action against him, alleging discourteous incompetence. In 1832 Field had successfully defended himself in a similar suit, denouncing the accusation as a &#145;criminal charge against a person who has passed a long and active life, hitherto without reproach&#146;  (court of governors' minutes, 16 Nov 1832, Guildhall Library, MS 12, 806/14, 623&#150;5). The governors, however, requested that he stay on until his successor had been selected.<br>
<br>Field died on 19 December 1837 at Woodford, Essex. His services to the Society of Apothecaries are minuted as &#145;most valuable and in some respects irreparable more especially in regard to his knowledge of the History and Antiquities of the Society&#146;, the court being &#145;anxious to record the high sense they entertain of the zeal, integrity and ability with which [he discharged] the various duties of his office&#146;  (court minutes, 30 Dec 1837, Guildhall Library, MS 8200/12, 223). While they lived, Field's two surviving and unmarried daughters, Esther (<i>b</i>. 1792) and Maria Laetitia (<i>b</i>. 1805), were the beneficiaries of his freehold estate, comprising a wharf and houses in Millbank Street, near Westminster. The large silver inkstand presented to him by the masters and officers of Christ's Hospital was bequeathed to his fourth son, Francis John Field (1791&#150;1857). As requested in his will (dated 9 December 1837), his remains were buried in the family vault in St Mary's Church, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 26 December 1837.<br>
