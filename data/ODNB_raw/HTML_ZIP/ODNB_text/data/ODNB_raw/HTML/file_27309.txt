<span class="headword">Thomson,  James</span>  (1768&#150;1855), <span class="occ">editor of the Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, born in May 1768 at Crieff, Perthshire, was the second son of John Thomson and his wife, Elizabeth Ewan. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27325/', "Thomas Thomson (1773&#150;1852)")</script> was his younger brother. He was educated at the parish school in Crieff and then at Edinburgh University. He was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Haddington on 6 August 1793, and frequently assisted his uncle, John Ewan, minister of Whittingehame, East Lothian. In 1795 he became associated with George Gleig, bishop of Brechin, as co-editor of the third edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. He wrote several articles himself, including &#145;Scripture&#146;, &#145;Septuagint&#146;, and &#145;Superstition&#146;. That on scripture was retained in several later editions. During the same period he prepared an edition of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, with short biographies of the contributors (8 vols., 1799). Also in 1799, he published <span class="italic">Rise, Progress, and Consequences of the New Opinions &hellip; Lately Introduced into France</span>. In 1796 he became tutor to the sons of John Stirling of Kippendavie, and resigned his post on the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> to his younger brother, Thomas. Both brothers were frequent contributors to the <span class="italic">Literary Journal</span> founded in 1803 by James Mill, James Thomson contributing the philosophic articles. On 26 August 1805 Thomson was ordained minister of Eccles, Berwickshire. In his country life he wrote a sketch of Berwickshire agriculture published in his brother's <span class="italic">Annals of Philosophy</span>. He also devoted himself to the study of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in the original tongues, and to the careful editing of his discourses on <span class="roman">St Luke</span> and the <span class="roman">Acts of the Apostles</span> published in 1845&#150;51 and 1854 respectively. In 1842 he received the honorary degree of DD from the University of St Andrews, and in 1847 he resigned his charge and retired to Edinburgh. In 1854 he moved to London, where he died on 28 November 1855.<br>
<br>On 10 October 1805 Thomson had married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of James Skene of Aberdeen, second son of George Skene of Skene, Aberdeenshire. She died in 1851, leaving three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27322/', "Robert Dundas Thomson")</script>; James Thomson, chairman of the government bank of Madras, and Andrew Skene Thomson. There was also a daughter, Eliza.<br>
