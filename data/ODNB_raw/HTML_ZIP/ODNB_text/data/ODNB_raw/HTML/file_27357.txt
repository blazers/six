</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thornton,  Henry</span>  (1760&#150;1815), <span class="occ">banker and political economist</span>, was born on 10 March 1760, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27358/', "John Thornton (1720&#150;1790)")</script>, of Clapham, Surrey, merchant and philanthropist, and his wife, Lucy (1722&#150;1785), daughter of Samuel Watson of Hull. John Thornton was one of the leading lay patrons of the early evangelical movement. Henry's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27362/', "Samuel Thornton")</script> achieved prominence as a merchant and governor of the Russia Company. At five Henry was sent to school with a Mr Davis on Wandsworth Common, and at thirteen he was moved to a Mr Roberts at Point Pleasant, Wandsworth. In his &#145;Recollections&#146;, written for his children, Thornton described his schooldays as unprofitable. He learned more than the usual amount of Latin and Greek from Davis, but suspected him of having been an &#145;unbeliever&#146; who rushed over prayers. Roberts offered a curriculum, taught entirely by himself, of &#145;latin, greek, french, rhetoric, drawing, arithmetic, reading, writing, speaking, geography, bowing, walking, fencing&#146;  (Thornton, &#145;Recollections&#146;), besides Hebrew and mathematics. Thornton acquired only &#145;habits of idleness&#146;  (ibid.) and many of his fellow pupils there were &#145;vicious&#146;  (ibid.). Henry spent 1778&#150;80 in the counting-house of his cousin Godfrey Thornton, in 1780 entering his father's house, where he subsequently became a partner. He left in 1784 (against his parents' advice) to join the banking firm of Down and Free which soon became Down, Thornton, and Free, of which he remained an active partner until his death. Under his management, and with the help of a legacy of about &pound;40,000 inherited from his father, Thornton's bank grew from a smallish concern into one of the largest in London, with an extensive network of country connections.<br>
<br>In 1782, at his mother's prompting, Thornton set out to contest Hull for parliament, but withdrew on finding that he was expected to make each voter a present of 2 guineas. In September that year he was elected for the London seat Southwark, which he held for the rest of his life. Although he refused to follow the custom of treating the Southwark voters to a guinea each, and lacked popular appeal, Thornton was respected for his integrity and independence. His share of the vote dropped in later years, partly, he felt, because he had neglected his constituents for occupations &#145;which I have thought more useful and becoming&#146;  (Thornton, &#145;Recollections&#146;).<br>
<br>Thornton regarded his father as &#145;on the whole a great character&#146;  (Thornton, &#145;Recollections&#146;). But he was a more cultivated and fastidious evangelical than his parents, whom he criticized for their &#145;peculiarities&#146;  (ibid.), ignorance of the world, and over-reliance on the doctrine of predestination which led them to be unsystematic about his education  (ibid.). His cousin William Wilberforce had been given house room by John Thornton after his conversion, and it was Wilberforce who became Henry's model in religion and one of his closest friends. In 1792 Thornton bought Battersea Rise, a villa on Clapham Common which he shared with Wilberforce until his marriage. The library at Battersea Rise (reputedly designed by William Pitt) became a meeting-place for the so-called Clapham Sect, a group that gathered informally around Wilberforce and became a powerful instrument of evangelical enterprise.<br>
<br>Like other Clapham evangelicals, Thornton felt called to public life by God. In politics he distrusted party spirit and insisted on &#145;the inconsistency of private vice with public virtue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, February 1807, 139). He came to regard the French Revolution as &#145;an experiment made upon human nature by men insensible of our natural corruption&#146;  (ibid., 140), and Napoleon as an extraordinary figure &#145;whom the Almighty has ordained to execute his righteous judgements on the earth&#146;  (ibid., September 1807, 628). Thornton was a diffident orator and spoke infrequently in parliament. His most valuable work there was done in committee. As an MP his first vote was in favour of peace with America, which immediately connected him with the friends of Pitt. Thornton generally supported Pitt, Henry Addington, and the Grenville&#150;Fox administration. He considered the war with France &#145;more just than almost any other in the British history&#146;  (Thornton, &#145;Recollections&#146;), yet favoured most initiatives for the restoration of peace. He approved of the peace of Amiens and was averse to the subsequent renewal of hostilities. Thornton voted for Catholic emancipation earlier than Wilberforce, and disagreed with his Clapham friends in opposing Spencer Perceval's orders in council (1807), fearing rightly for their effect on relations with America. He supported Earl Grey's 1797 motion for parliamentary reform and backed measures against sinecures and the sale of seats, while having no sympathy for the ideas of radicals and &#145;democrats&#146;.<br>
<br>Thornton served on parliamentary committees to examine the public debt (1798), the Irish exchange (1804), and public expenditure (1807 onwards). In 1810 he was appointed to the bullion committee, which investigated the high price of gold, the state of the currency, and foreign exchange. The committee's report, written by Thornton, Francis Horner, and William Huskisson, pressed unsuccessfully for the resumption of cash payments (suspended by the Bank of England in 1797) after two years. He published two speeches on the report in 1811.<br>
<br>Thornton lived at a time of change and turbulence in the banking system, and it was the crisis of 1797 that produced his most enduring legacy as an economist, <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain</span> (1802). Intended to expose some popular errors, such as the notion that an increase in paper was itself responsible for current economic ills, the book grew into a general treatise, described by J. S. Mill as &#145;the clearest exposition that I am acquainted with, in the English language, of the modes in which credit is given and taken in a mercantile community&#146;  (Mill, 3.11.4). The work provided a complete account of the English monetary system: not only the circulation of money, but also a detailed discussion of how the Bank of England should act to prevent instability, and also how to deal with instability whenever it occurred. According to the <span class="italic">New Palgrave</span> &#145;Thornton's exposition of the issues involved represents an important contribution to monetary economics&#146;  (Laidler, &#145;Thornton, Henry&#146;).<br>
<br>An article by Horner in the first number of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> helped to spread Thornton's ideas; the book appeared in French and German translations (Geneva, 1803; Halle, 1803), in America (Philadelphia, 1807), and was reprinted in 1857 by J. R. McCulloch. Marx owes something to Thornton and quotes him in the <span class="italic">Grundrisse</span>. Among his contemporaries Thornton was generally eclipsed by David Ricardo. His twentieth-century reputation, initially the result of transatlantic interest, rates highly his originality and powers of analysis, and places him in the front rank of monetary economists.<br>
<br>Thornton played a leading role in the Clapham Sect's opposition to slavery, support for Christian missions, and concern to reform public manners. In 1791 he became chairman of the court of directors of the newly constituted Sierra Leone Company, which took over Granville Sharp's failed &#145;Province of Freedom&#146; settlement dedicated to establishing a colony of freed slaves in Africa. The company aimed to confer on Africa the blessings of European religion and civilization through a trading operation that would be both profitable and free from the taint of slavery. Thornton was the company's most influential director and remained chairman throughout its life, writing virtually all its published reports and administering Sierra Leone from offices alongside his bank in Birchin Lane. He formed a lasting friendship with Zachary Macaulay, governor of the colony from 1794 to 1799 and then secretary to the company. Sierra Leone was transferred to the crown in 1808. The company had not prospered. It was undermined by the continuing slave trade, disasters suffered in the French war, disputes between groups of settlers, and also (as Thornton acknowledged in his &#145;Recollections&#146;) inexperience and over-optimism on the part of himself and his fellow directors. Notwithstanding the commercial failure, Thornton blessed the project for teaching him &#145;to feel for the african race&#146;  (Thornton, &#145;Recollections&#146;), and hoped that providence would still make it an instrument of good. Thornton became treasurer of the African Institution, founded in the wake of slave trade abolition with similar aims to the Sierra Leone Company.<br>
<br>Thornton is said to have contributed over eighty articles to the Clapham Sect's journal, the <span class="italic">Christian Observer</span>, which he helped to launch in 1802. He enjoyed a warm friendship with Hannah More, to whom Wilberforce introduced him in 1789. He gave money to her schools, and wrote and revised tracts for her <span class="roman">Cheap Repository</span> series, visiting hawkers on her behalf to learn the secrets of the distribution trade. He was first president of the Sunday School Society, founded in 1785. Other evangelical societies predictably chose Thornton as treasurer, including the British and Foreign Bible Society (1804) and the Society for Missions to Africa and the East (1799, later the Church Missionary Society). Thornton shared in the efforts of Wilberforce, Charles Grant, and other friends to change the East India Company charter in favour of evangelizing the Indians. Like his father, he bought church livings to present to suitable clergymen.<br>
<br>On 1 March 1796 Thornton married Marianne Sykes (1765&#150;1815), only daughter of Joseph Sykes, a Hull merchant and an evangelical. They had nine children. The eldest son, Henry Sykes Thornton (1800&#150;1881), succeeded his father in banking; the youngest, the Revd Charles Thornton (1810&#150;1839), became a friend of John Henry Newman and the Tractarians. The marriage was affectionate; in his family Thornton was warmer and more spontaneous than he usually appeared to the outside world. He took great care over the education and religious upbringing of his children, insisting on their being useful and aware of public affairs from an early age. His eldest daughter's &#145;Recollections&#146;, quoted extensively by Thornton's great-grandson E. M. Forster in <span class="italic">Marianne Thornton, 1797&#150;1887: a Domestic Biography</span> (1956), show the Thornton household as a model of evangelical family life, that great influence on the Victorians. The children's guardian, Sir Robert Inglis, published a number of Thornton's writings after his death, all concerned with domestic worship and education: <span class="italic">Family Prayers</span> (1834), family commentaries on the sermon on the mount and the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> (1835, 1837), <span class="italic">Lectures on the Ten Commandments</span> (1843), and <span class="italic">Female Characters</span> (1846). <span class="italic">Family Prayers</span> was widely used, and went through more than thirty editions in twenty years.<br>
<br>According to Sir James Stephen's essay on the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42140', "Clapham Sect")</script>, Thornton &#145;never laid aside the Ermine&#146;  (Stephen, 295). He was grave, dispassionate, and rational, inspired by Wilberforce but utterly unlike him. Yet Wilberforce himself recognized &#145;the generous heart that glowed within&#146;  (Wilberforce and Wilberforce, 4.231); as the story of the Sierra Leone Company shows, Thornton could be moved by vision and enthusiasm as much as by prudence and business sense. Brougham called Thornton &#145;the most eminent in every respect&#146; of Wilberforce's associates  (Brougham, 1.273). His charity, mostly to evangelical causes, was considerable: Stephen says that he gave away between &pound;2000 and &pound;9000 a year, six-sevenths of his income before his marriage and one-third after it. When income tax was introduced he paid more than required, believing that the tax, though just, was not fairly distributed. As a banker he would stand by insolvent clients who had, for example, obtained credit from a third party because of their association with him: a moral obligation which once cost him more than &pound;20,000. He valued a good income, but declined to build up a great fortune for his children, urging them in his &#145;Recollections&#146; to follow his own and his father's example of limited expenses and large liberality. Thornton's health was never good. His headaches, sleeplessness, and digestive troubles were exacerbated by overwork; from 1799 he took opium. He became ill in the autumn of 1814 and died of consumption on 16 January 1815 at Wilberforce's house in Kensington Gore, London. He was buried in the Thornton vault at the Old Church, Clapham, Surrey, on 24 January.<br>
