<span class="headword">Towerson,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1584), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of Robert Towerson, yeoman, of Calder in Cumberland. In 1551 he was apprenticed for seven years to Miles Mording, a London skinner. On 15 January 1560 he married Margery, eldest daughter of James Hawes, a prominent and well-connected London merchant, with whom he had four children. After the death of Margery on 18 January 1565, he married Parnell Wilford (<i>d</i>. 1615), whose brother Thomas had been involved in the Guinea trade; they had twelve children, one of whom was the naval officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27591/', "Gabriel Towerson (bap. 1576, d. 1623)")</script>.<br>
<br>During the 1550s Towerson played an important role in the development of the African trade, leading three trading voyages to Guinea. His first voyage, made with the <i>Hart</i> and the <i>Hind</i>, each of about 60 tons burden, set out on 30 September 1555. After trading peacefully along the coast of west Africa, he returned to London with a profitable cargo of about fifty ivory tusks and 127 lb of gold. His second voyage, set out in September 1556, was a more ambitious undertaking, being made up of the <i>Tiger</i> of 120 tons, the <i>Hart</i> of 60 tons, and a small pinnace. In Guinea he entered into an informal alliance with a French captain, Denis Blondel (or Blundell), who was in charge of an expedition of five vessels. The combined fleet sailed on to the Gold Coast, where an indecisive battle was fought with five Portuguese ships, though the latter succeeded in scattering the Anglo-French fleet. Despite quarrelling between the English and French leaders, Towerson continued trading along the coast, possibly reaching Beraku, east of the Portuguese fort at S&atilde;o Jorge da Mina, where one of the native chiefs, described by the English as King Abaan, apparently invited the English to build a fort in his territory. He returned to London in April 1557 with a lading of 69 lb of gold and various amounts of ivory and pepper.<br>
<br>Towerson's last recorded voyage to Guinea, which set out in January 1558, was made with the <i>Minion</i>, the <i>Christopher</i>, the <i>Tiger</i>, and a small pinnace. The <i>Minion</i> and <i>Christopher</i> were both owned by the queen, and according to the Spanish ambassador the expedition sailed with the approval of the lord admiral, William Howard, despite objections from the Portuguese. After a skirmish with five Portuguese vessels along the Guinea coast, Towerson attacked three French ships, seizing one as prize, though it was so leaky that it was sunk. Towerson wanted to sail on to Benin, to test the commercial openings in a region as yet little known to the English, but was prevented from doing so by his company. Unfortunately, his late arrival in Guinea that year meant that many African rulers had already disposed of their limited gold supplies to rival French traders. Though some trade occurred, it was also limited by African suspicions of the English, and fear of Portuguese retaliation. After burning the town of Shama, sickness and disease broke out among Towerson's men. The <i>Tiger</i> had to be abandoned because the crew were too weak to man her. Shortly afterwards the <i>Christopher</i> was lost at sea. The two surviving vessels reached the Isle of Wight on 20 October 1558. Though Towerson may have returned with more gold than in 1557, the difficulties he encountered during this voyage led him to abandon the Guinea trade. The accounts of Towerson's Guinea voyages, which Richard Hakluyt published in <span class="italic">The Principall Navigations</span> of 1589, were almost certainly written by Towerson himself shortly after the voyages ended. They contain valuable information about commercial and political conditions along the Guinea coast. Towerson's account of the second voyage is also of some importance in naval history, providing the earliest description in English of a broadside artillery duel at sea.<br>
<br>Towerson was made free of the Skinners' Company in 1559, and sat on the common council of London from 1561 to 1583. During the 1560s he was heavily involved in trading with Antwerp. In 1564 he wrote a useful, though unpublished, account of the navigation to Friesland. He was active in the Iberian trades, becoming a leading member of the Spanish Company, established in 1577. He was also a member of the Russia Company, and one of the original members of the Eastland Company, incorporated in 1579. During the early 1580s he was involved in developing English trade with Constantinople. In 1582 he was one of the commissioners appointed by the Russia Company to supervise the preparations for Edward Fenton's (abortive) voyage to the East Indies. The following year he met John Dee, Adrian Gilbert, and John Davis to discuss the north-west passage. Soon afterwards he was appointed to a committee of Merchant Adventurers to examine Christopher Carleill's plans for a voyage of discovery to North America. Towerson was buried in St Michael's Church, Cornhill, beside his first wife, on 17 June 1584. One of his sons, William, sailed with Fenton in 1582 and went on to become a prominent merchant in the City of London.<br>
