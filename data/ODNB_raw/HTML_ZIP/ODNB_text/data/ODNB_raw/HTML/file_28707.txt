<span class="headword">Ward,  Thomas</span>  (1652&#150;1708), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic controversialist</span>, was born on 13 April 1652 at Danby Castle, near Guisborough, Yorkshire, the eldest son of a farmer, and was educated at Pickering School, becoming proficient in arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy. He declined his father's advice to enter one of the professions and became tutor to the children of a gentleman of fortune, in which post he became interested in religious controversy, church history, the fathers, and scripture. His &#145;lively eccentric fancy strongly inclined him&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Reformation</span>, xxiv) to a love of burlesque poetry. He had been brought up as a Presbyterian or Calvinist, but his studies in theological controversy induced him to join the Roman Catholic church, against the wishes of his father, who cut him out of his will. He married a Catholic wife soon after his conversion. After his father's death he brought about the conversion of his mother and the rest of his family. With his wife's and mother's consent he travelled in France and Italy, and at Rome he accepted a commission in the pope's guards, remaining in the service for five or six years, during which time he served in the maritime war against the Turks. Before this he may have served as a trooper in the Horse Guards in England. In Rome he frequented monuments and libraries, especially that of the Vatican, where he researched key documents relating to the religious history of England.<br>
<br>In 1685, following the demands of his wife and family, Ward returned to England, where lords Derwentwater and Lumley, Colonel Thomas Radcliffe, and Mr Thornton, who were impressed by his learning and wit, became his patrons. His <span class="italic">Errata to the Protestant Bible</span> (1688), which saw many editions, showed him to be &#145;a man of genious, judgment, and erudition&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Reformation</span>, xxvii). Based on Gregory Martin's <span class="italic">Discoverie of the Manifold Corruptions of the Holy Scriptures by the Heretiques of our Daies</span> (1582), it sought to demonstrate that errors found in protestant translations of the scriptures were deliberate. From this time he engaged in a polemical war with protestants. His translation of <span class="italic">Some Queries to the Protestants</span> (1687), by the convert dean of Derry, Peter Manby, was answered by Dr William Clagett, and his posthumous <span class="italic">The Controversy of Ordination Truly Stated</span> (1719), an attack on Gilbert Burnet's <span class="italic">Vindication</span> (1677), was responded to by David Williams and Thomas Elrington. A local disputation of 1697&#150;8 is recorded in <span class="italic">An Interesting Controversy with Mr. Ritschel, Vicar of Hexham</span> (1819). He was one of the few Catholics who used the broadsheet as a medium, as in his <span class="italic">Roman Catholick Souldier's Letter to Dr. Tho. Tenison</span> (1688), and his &#145;Speculum ecclesiasticum&#146; (1687), which was an epitome of church history, and probably identical to &#145;The tree of life, or, The church of Christ represented&#146; (1688). He defended the argument of the &#145;Speculum&#146; in his <span class="italic">Monomachia, or, A Duel between Dr Tho. Tenison &hellip; and a Roman Catholick Souldier</span> (1687), though Tenison believed its author was really a Jesuit in disguise, and Henry Wharton assured the public that this soldier was originally a Cambridge scholar who had exchanged his black coat for a red one. <span class="italic">England's Reformation from the Time K. Henry VIII to the End of Oates's Plot</span> (1710), his most popular, though unfinished work, was modelled on Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> and written as a burlesque, a &#145;ludicrous channel for conveying the history of the Reformation to the public, because he saw it most adapted to the state of the times&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Reformation</span>, xxvii). Its later editions with engravings are a unique example from this period of English Catholic graphic satire.<br>
<br>Ward's flight to the continent at the revolution prevented publication of his &#145;History of England&#146;. He had one son, the secular priest Lawrence Ward, alias Green, and three daughters, one of whom was a nun in Brussels. He is said to have died and been buried at St Germain in 1708, though there is no reference to his burial in the registers of St Germain-en-Laye. &#145;His disposition was generous and mild, though not incapable of being provoked to resentment; he even fought two duels in his youth &hellip; He was, in fine, a valiant soldier, a penetrating naturalist, an accurate writer, an agreeable companion, and a charitable Christian&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Reformation</span>, xxvii).<br>
