<span class="headword">Durham,  William  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1249), <span class="occ">theologian and university benefactor</span>, may have been born at Sedgefield, co. Durham. Nothing otherwise is known of his origins or early life, until he is recorded as a regent master in theology at Paris, at a date between 1220 and 1223. To Matthew Paris, Durham was a famous master, a tribute amply accounted for by the range and sophistication of the questions attributed to him in Douai, Biblioth&egrave;que de la Ville, MS 434; these suggest that he also wrote a commentary on Peter Lombard's <span class="italic">Sentences</span>. Durham was still at Paris in 1229, when, with other English masters, he was forced to leave when the university was dispersed by the secular authorities. But if he returned to England, he soon left again, to become archdeacon of Caux in Normandy, and also to hold the living of Laise, which carried with it a stall in Rouen Cathedral. His position in the diocese came to be such that on 30 March 1236 a majority of the canons elected him archbishop. But the minority appealed against the election to the pope, on grounds that included William's holding the archdeaconry in plurality with Laise, and Durham, perhaps feeling the force of this objection, had by 12 August 1236 declined to accept election.<br>
<br>Instead Durham returned to England, probably to his native county, where in the previous year Bishop Richard Poor had made him a life grant of the episcopal manors of Wearmouth and Ryhope and the town of Sunderland, within which the rectory of Wearmouth was almost certainly comprehended. For this he was to pay a yearly rent of 40 marks. He may well have been intending to settle in the north-east, since in 1237 and 1238 he was given timber by the crown to make beams for the house he was building at Wearmouth. But letters of protection he received in November 1244 may indicate that he was about to go overseas, perhaps to Rome, since he was at some time appointed a papal chaplain. He certainly went abroad in 1248, when he mounted a successful defence at the curia at Lyons of his rights in Wearmouth, which had been challenged by Poor's successor, Bishop Nicholas of Farnham. He set off back to England via Normandy, but died at Rouen between 25 March and 11 May 1249.<br>
<br>Matthew Paris remarked upon Durham's wealth, and alleged that he was greedy to add to it. Be that as it may, Durham became a notable posthumous benefactor to Oxford University. He is not in fact known to have studied at Oxford, though his being owed &pound;20 by Studley Priory, Warwickshire, in 1243 shows that he had contacts with the English midlands. But in his will he bequeathed 310 marks (&pound;206 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) to the university, directing that the money be invested in rents which should provide for ten or more masters studying theology. Two halls were bought, one in 1253 and the other in 1255, and further purchases followed, but when about 1280 a committee of masters was appointed to investigate the uses to which Durham's bequest had been put, it was found that much of the money had either been diverted to the university's own purposes or lent to outsiders, and that the properties acquired as Durham had instructed were bringing in only some &pound;12 per annum. The attempt to implement Durham's bequest which resulted from these inquiries effectively amounted to the foundation of a new college, albeit a very small one, of just four fellows; it was supported by the rents already acquired, and by further purchases paid for with such money from the bequest as could be recovered. Additional statutes were issued in 1292, and these, together with a gradual improvement in its financial position, helped to secure the position of what was to become known as University College.<br>
