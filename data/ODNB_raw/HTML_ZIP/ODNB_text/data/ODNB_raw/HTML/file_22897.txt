<span class="headword">Purchas,  John</span>  (1823&#150;1872), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, eldest son of Captain William Jardine Purchas RN (1779&#150;1848), sometime mayor of Cambridge, and his wife, Jane Hills, a niece of the novelist Frederick Marryat (1792&#150;1848), was born at Cambridge on 14 July 1823, and educated at Rugby School from 1836. He was admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, on 8 July 1840, and graduated BA in 1844. He served as curate at Elsworth, Cambridgeshire, from 1851 to 1853, at Orwell in the same county from 1856 to 1859, and at St Paul's, West Street, Brighton, from 1861 to 1866. He was appointed perpetual curate of St James's Chapel, Brighton, in 1866, and there he introduced practices that were denounced as ritualistic. On 27 November 1869 he was charged before Sir Robert Phillimore, dean of the court of arches at Canterbury, with infringing the law of the established church by using a cope (otherwise than during the communion service), chasubles, albs, stoles, tunicles, dalmatics, birettas, wafer bread, lighted candles on the altar, crucifixes, images, and holy water. He was also accused of standing with his back to the people when consecrating the elements, mixing water with the wine, censing the minister, leaving the holy table uncovered during the service, directing processions round the church, and giving notice of unauthorized holidays. Purchas did not appear, claiming that he was too poor to pay for legal assistance and too infirm to defend the case in person. On 3 February 1870 Phillimore ruled against him on eight points. This decision was not satisfactory to the promoter of the suit, Colonel Charles James Elphinstone, who appealed for a fuller condemnation of Purchas to the queen in council, but died on 30 March 1870 before the case was heard. Henry Hebbert of Brighton, a retired judge of the high court at Bombay, was then permitted to revive the appeal. The privy council decided against Purchas on 16 May 1871, declaring that eucharistic vestments, the eastward position, the mixed chalice, and wafer bread were all illegal. Purchas, however, had made over all his property to his wife, and he neither paid the costs, amounting to over &pound;2096, nor discontinued the illegal practices. On 7 February 1872 the privy council consequently suspended him from the discharge of his clerical office for twelve months.<br>
<br>The &#145;Purchas judgment&#146; gave rise to much controversy but proved virtually impossible to enforce, since most bishops were reluctant to take the ritualists to court. Although a copy of the order of suspension was affixed to the door of St James's Chapel on 18 February 1872, Purchas continued his services as usual for the last months of his life. He died at his home in Montpellier Villas, Brighton, on 18 October 1872, and was buried in the churchyard of St James's on 23 October. He left a widow and five sons.<br>
<br>Purchas's best-known work was the <span class="italic">Directorium Anglicanum</span> (1858), a standard manual on Anglican ritual. In his youth he had published a comedy, <span class="italic">The Miser's Daughter</span> (1839), and several volumes of poetry, but his later works were exclusively ecclesiastical.<br>
