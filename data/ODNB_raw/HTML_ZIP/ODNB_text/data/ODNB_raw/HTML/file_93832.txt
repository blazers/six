<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brett,  Lionel Gordon Baliol</span>, fourth Viscount Esher  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">architect and town planner</span>, was born on 18 July 1913 at Orchard Lea, Winkfield, in Windsor Forest, Berkshire, the eldest of three children and only son of Oliver Sylvain Baliol Brett, from 1930 third Viscount Esher (1881&#150;1963), and his wife, Antoinette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Heckscher (<i>d</i>. 1965), daughter of August Heckscher of New York. He was born at his paternal grandfather's house, which was a legacy of his close relationship to the court of Queen Victoria, but in 1921 his father bought Watlington Park, Oxfordshire, where Brett himself lived in the post-war years. In retrospect he felt deprived of unconditional affection as a child, writing, &#145;I knew I had the gifts that in those days were supposed to guarantee success. But the bad fairy at my christening had brought two other presents&#151;a compulsion to succeed and a longing to be liked&#146;  (<span class="italic">Our Selves Unknown</span>, 48). Academic success at Eton College came easily, and took him to New College, Oxford, with a history scholarship in 1932, although he had already declared his intention to be an architect. He graduated with a first-class degree in 1935. On 22 October the same year he married (Helena) Christian Olive Pike (1914&#150;2006), the eldest daughter of Colonel Ebenezer John Lecky Pike, an officer in the Grenadier Guards. This was one factor that influenced a rather impatient entry into his new profession, via an incomplete course at the Architectural Association, a short pupillage with A. S. G. Butler, a pupil of Sir Edwin Lutyens, and some cramming for the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) exams. He later regretted that as a result of his truncated architectural education he was not confident enough to work on his own as an architect. A convert to the modern movement, he joined the architects William and Aileen Tatton Brown briefly, designing with them an extension to his aunt's house. He won the RIBA's Ashpitel prize in 1939. He and his wife had five sons and a daughter, between 1936 and 1952.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Brett enlisted in the Royal Artillery, and joined in the invasion of Europe in 1944. Part of his mind was filled with schemes of post-war reconstruction, and after coming third in the 1945 election as Liberal candidate for South Oxfordshire, and being demobilized with the rank of major, Brett formed a brief professional alliance with Clough Williams-Ellis for making town plans for Littlehampton, Sussex, and Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and worked alongside Patrick Abercrombie on plans for Redditch new town. In 1947 he was appointed architect&#150;planner for Hatfield New Town and recruited Kenneth Boyd as a partner, later joined by Peter Bosanquet, working initially in a converted cowshed at Watlington. Other commissions came for Stevenage and Basildon, and Brett took charge himself of several private houses, as well as the high commissioner's residence at Lagos. Their public housing designs and layouts, aiming for urbanity, were professionally well received, but an elegant serpentine terrace in Hatfield built by Wimpey with a novel aluminium roof suffered storm damage in November 1957, some fifty houses losing their roofs. Brett felt that the public enquiry that followed was a needlessly vindictive way to determine liability, and bore the scars of this event. The practice dissolved, and Brett travelled to the USA to lecture on new towns, and elsewhere for planning consultancy.<br>
<br>In 1960 Brett accepted an invitation from the architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101019/', "Francis Pollen")</script>, an architect of great natural ability specializing in Catholic and domestic work, to go into partnership as Brett and Pollen. Some of their work was collaborative, with Brett suggesting strategies, and Pollen giving form to the design, but other projects were individual. Brett (who succeeded his father as fourth Viscount Esher in 1963) continued to focus on planning.<br>
<br>In 1963 he won the commission for the redevelopment of the Guildhall area of Portsmouth, including Portsmouth civic centre, and worked on the buildings with Harry Teggin, who joined Brett and Pollen and became a third partner, specializing in black steel and glass construction. Teggin helped to bring the practice's image up to date and gained widespread admiration for its work, such as 82&#150;90 Sloane Street, London, and Pall Mall Court in King Street, Manchester, as well as contributing to the planning side. Esher was also involved in schemes for Abingdon, as well as for Santiago, Chile, and Caracas, Venezuela. In 1965 he published a study of south Oxfordshire, <span class="italic">Landscape in Distress</span>. This was also the year in which he became president of the RIBA. In 1966 he was selected by Richard Crossman (his former history tutor at Oxford) to make one of a set of pilot studies of historic towns, on York. &#145;Its central purpose was not &#147;conservation&#148; &hellip; but the return of people to live in the heart of a once densely populated mediaeval environment&#146;, he later wrote  (Esher to Alan Powers, 18 February 2003, priv. coll.). The report was handsomely published in 1969 and widely read. One of his own best designs from this period was the brick tower house, a reworking of a historic form amid tall trees, with a moat, at Christmas Common on the Watlington estate, that he built for himself in 1967.<br>
<br>By the late 1960s personal relationships between Esher, Pollen, and Teggin had become strained, and when Esher was invited in 1971 to succeed Sir Robin Darwin as rector of the Royal College of Art, he saw a way out and handed the practice to his partners. Unfortunately, it was a turbulent period in higher education, and he failed to stop a simmering revolt at the college, although it was defused before he left in 1978. He devoted himself subsequently to the diverse range of committee work in the heritage and environment sector that had formed a background to his whole adult life (he was, <i>inter alia</i>, a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission, 1951&#150;69, and of the Arts Council, 1972&#150;7, a trustee of the Soane Museum, 1976&#150;94, and chairman of the Thames and Chilterns region of the National Trust, 1979&#150;83), and to continuing his career as a writer. In 1947 his first book for Penguin, <span class="italic">Houses</span>, praised modernism as a continuation of the Georgian traditions of urban form. <span class="italic">Parameters and Images</span> (1970) was an investigation of architectural and planning problems in the light of modernism's incipient collapse, a story told again in <span class="italic">A Broken Wave</span> (1981). Esher's writing style was sometimes too epigrammatic and clever to match the seriousness of his thoughts, but it was evidence of his humanity and breadth of concern. His love of mountains emerged in the <span class="roman">Shell Guide</span> to <span class="italic">North Wales</span> (1971), written with Elisabeth Beazley; he had been offered this commission since he had a holiday house on the Portmeirion estate. <span class="italic">Our Selves Unknown</span> (1985), his autobiography, was an honest self-portrait.<br>
<br>Reg Gadney, a supporter at the Royal College of Art, wrote that &#145;Esher was one of those rare Englishmen of influence whose goodness was strengthened, paradoxically, by sensitivity and self-doubt. He took far less from life than he gave to it, and was the most lovable of men&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 13 July 2004). He died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on 9 July 2004, of septicaemia and perforated diverticular disease, and was survived by his wife of sixty-eight years, Christian, and their six children; he was succeeded as fifth viscount by his eldest son, Christopher (<i>b</i>. 1936).<br>
