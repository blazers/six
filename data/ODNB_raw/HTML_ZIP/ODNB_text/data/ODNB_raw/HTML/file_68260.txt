<span class="headword">Willan,  Leonard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1648&#150;1670), <span class="occ">writer</span>, may have been from Yorkshire; the surname is associated with the county. <span class="italic">Alumni Cantabrigienses</span> states that a student of that forename and surname, who may have been from Kingston upon Hull, matriculated as a fellow-commoner of Christ's College, Cambridge, in June 1623. The college's own register, however, does not record this matriculation.<br>
<br>Willan appears to have enjoyed a reputation in the middle years of the seventeenth century for his literary abilities; he was a friend of both James Howell, the historiographer royal, and the poet Robert Herrick, who in <span class="italic">Hesperides</span> (1648) addressed commendatory verses &#145;To M. Leonard Willan his Peculiar Friend&#146;. Willan's first volume to appear in print, <span class="italic">The Phrygian fabulist, or, The fables of &AElig;sop extracted from the Latine copie, and moraliz'd</span> (1650), contains some of his best work, including the tale of &#145;A Citie-mous and Field-mous&#146;, the longest of his fables, a slyly humorous account of achieved contentment. His idiom of contained ambition recalls Herrick or, given especially &#145;The troubles of the times in which it formed was&#146;, Richard Lovelace. With this allusion to the civil war  (sig. A4<i>r</i>), Willan subscribes the dedication of the volume to Edward Sackville, fourth earl of Dorset. From this inscription something of the writer's life can be inferred. The nobleman appears to have interested himself in Willan's early career, &#145;the first fruits of my Pen&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>): &#145;your careless eie by chance surpriz'd a Virgin scarcely drest, Poor <i>Astraea</i>, whose Tongue and Habit I had fashion'd to our use&#146;, the author recalls  (sig. A3<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>), but the uncertain political situation precluded Dorset's further encouragement. The peer was an active but moderate politician who tempered a strong respect for the royal prerogative with a keen sense of the worth of parliamentary liberties, but following the execution of Charles I he retired entirely from public life. Although a version of Willan's earliest work seems to have circulated in manuscript before he turned to the fables, <span class="italic">Astraea, or, True Love's Myrrour: a Pastoral</span> (1651), a dramatized versification of D'Urfey's romance, was the second title published in his name. There then followed a period of silence, &#145;the obscurity of many years&#146; as he put it in the dedication, to Lady Frances Wildegoss, of his next work, <span class="italic">Orgula, or, The Fatall Error: a Tragedy</span> (1658)  (sig. A2<i>r</i>). Willan develops the dedicatory address into a critical preface in which he defends poetry against the charges that it is fantastical and unsocial, before turning to its theatrical applications, and its political, social, and educational benefits. Both <span class="italic">Astraea</span> and <span class="italic">Orgula</span> are characterized by disguises, mislaid letters, overheard conversations, and lyrical interludes, and each publication contains lengthy, solemnly prescriptive stage directions which tell of the printing of texts never to be produced in the theatre. His last known work was a prose treatise, <span class="italic">The Perfect States-Man</span> (1668), republished as <span class="italic">The Exact Politician or Compleat Statesman</span> (1670). In it he reflects on the personal qualities desirable in a minister of state, his office and its perquisites, the nature, ends, and prosecution of the law, and the regulation of the law both to secure personal well-being and to defend private property. It is not known when Willan died.<br>
