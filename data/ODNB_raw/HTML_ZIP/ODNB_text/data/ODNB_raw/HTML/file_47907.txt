<span class="headword">Matthey,  George</span>  (1825&#150;1913), <span class="occ">refiner and metallurgist</span>, was born on 8 May 1825, the fourth son of John Matthey, a stockbroker and foreign-exchange dealer, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Green. George was educated at Arragon House in Twickenham, but his career was determined by an agreement between his father and Percival Norton Johnson, a family friend and business client. This allowed for two sons of the former to enter Johnson's business in Hatton Garden, London, in return for the injection of new capital, believed to be about &pound;10,000. Thus in 1838 Johnson, who at this time was refining gold, silver, and platinum on a modest scale, took on George Matthey as an apprentice.<br>
<br>Initially working in the assay laboratory, Matthey benefited from the knowledge and experience of Johnson and had William John Cock (1813&#150;1892) as his mentor. In 1845 Matthey was put in charge of platinum refining, and it was due mainly to his persistent scientific endeavour over many years that the refining and fabrication of platinum was developed from a laboratory activity into a successful industrial enterprise. He persuaded Johnson to participate in the Great Exhibition in 1851; his display of platinum received a prize, but was outshone by a French competitor, who exhibited a large platinum still, used for the concentration of sulphuric acid. This spurred Matthey into deciding to become pre-eminent in the platinum business.<br>
<br>The first source of natural platinum was the Choc&oacute; region of South America. Then, in the 1820s, significant platinum was found in the Ural Mountains in Russia; to begin with, this was subjected to an imperial monopoly, but in 1850 some mine owners there appointed George Matthey as their refiner and selling agent. Almost immediately, in 1851, he was taken into partnership by Johnson, and the firm became Johnson and Matthey. From then on Johnson began to relinquish control of the company's affairs, and on his retirement in 1860 Matthey became senior partner, the other two partners being Matthey's younger brother, Edward, and John Scudamore Sellon, a nephew of Mrs Percival Norton Johnson. The former concentrated on the gold- and silver-refining side of the business, while Sellon was largely responsible for commercial affairs. In 1891 George Matthey became the first chairman of Johnson Matthey &amp; Co., a position he held until his retirement in 1909.<br>
<br>Until the early 1900s an important use of platinum was for the manufacture of boilers in which the relatively dilute sulphuric acid produced by the chamber process could be concentrated up to about 95 per cent, or even higher. Originally this was done in small glass retorts, but their fragile nature resulted in many accidents and significant losses. Early platinum vessels were operated on a batch principle, the weak acid being boiled down to the required specific gravity before being poured or siphoned out and the operation repeated. However, at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855 Johnson and Matthey exhibited a platinum boiler designed for continuous operation. This had been developed in collaboration with William Petrie (1821&#150;1908), one of the earliest chemical engineers, and was more economical to operate. Later, Matthey's invention of platinum fusion welding, using a blowpipe flame, was to reduce the cost and greatly improve the quality of such boilers. The 1855 exhibition was particularly significant, for there Matthey became friendly with Paul Fran&ccedil;ois Morin, an associate of Professor Henri Sainte-Claire Deville and Jules Henri Debray. In 1857 Deville and Debray devised a lime-block furnace in which platinum could be melted and refined on a large scale for the first time; the British patent rights to the process were taken up by Matthey.<br>
<br>At the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1867, Johnson Matthey displayed some 15,000&#150;20,000 ounces of manufactured platinum. A gold medal was awarded for the exhibit, and George Matthey became a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. Discussions held at this exhibition led to the formation of the international metric commission. Platinum with 10 per cent iridium was selected for the fabrication of standard metres and kilograms, and over many years Matthey played an important part in the production of such standards. Crucially, he refined the constituents by a new method which he described in a paper to the Royal Society in 1879. In the same year he was elected FRS. Over the years, his acute business sense enabled him to see opportunities for the expansion of the platinum business and these he developed until both technical and commercial success were achieved. With the platinum business firmly established, Matthey maintained mutually beneficial contacts with the scientific community. An eminent member of several scientific and technical bodies, he was active in the establishment of the City and Guilds colleges at South Kensington and Finsbury. At times he held directorships in a variety of companies. Elected to the Goldsmiths' Company in 1853, he became a member of its court in 1853, and served as prime warden in 1872 and 1894.<br>
<br>In 1853 Matthey married Charlotte Ann Davies (<i>d</i>. 1919), daughter of Richard Davies of South Hackney. They had eleven children, of whom Richard Davies Matthey (1858&#150;1929) and Percy St Clair Matthey (1863&#150;1928) subsequently entered the family business. George Matthey died at Rosemount, his Eastbourne residence, on 14 February 1913.<br>
<br>Almost 150 years later Johnson Matthey was still successfully engaged in the refining, fabrication, and marketing of gold and silver, and the platinum metals; in 1994&#150;5 the company was the largest gold refiner in the world, and the sole marketing agent and joint refiner for Rustenburg Platinum Mines, the world's largest source of the platinum metals.<br>
