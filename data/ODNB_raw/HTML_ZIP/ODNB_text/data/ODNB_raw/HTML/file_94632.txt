<span class="headword">Weir,  Mary <span class="st"> [Molly]</span></span>  (1910&#150;2004), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 17 March 1910 at 134 Adamswell Street, Springburn, Glasgow, the eldest of the four children of Thomas Weir (1888&#150;1916), a journeyman engine fitter, and his wife, Jeanie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davidson. One of her siblings was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97327/', "Tom Weir (1914&#150;2006)")</script>, the well-known broadcaster and writer on country life. After their father was killed in action during the early stages of the First World War, she and her siblings were brought up by their mother and grandmother in a typical east-end Glasgow tenement building. Despite the poverty of the surroundings&#151;Springburn was then one of the most deprived areas in Britain&#151;Weir was inculcated with the strict values and work ethic that remained with her throughout her life. On leaving school she trained as a shorthand typist, and for her phenomenal speed she was affectionately nicknamed the Flying Scotswoman. By now she had joined a local amateur dramatic society, the Pantheon Club. At the outset of the Second World War she was employed as a typist in a munitions factory where she entertained workmates with a variety show of her own devising. She also enjoyed success on the <span class="italic">Carroll Levis Discoveries</span> radio talent show and gained second place as a mimic. Encouraged by this she turned professional and found regular employment on Scottish radio, with frequent appearances on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span>, winning a reputation as a budding comedian. On 13 October 1938 she married her childhood sweetheart, Alexander (Sandy) Hamilton (<i>d</i>. 1997), a shipping clerk, and son of James Hamilton, engine fitter, then aged twenty-eight. The couple, who had no children, lived first in Glasgow and then moved to London in 1945.<br>
<br>Weir's first breakthrough occurred two years later when she was cast as Tattie McIntosh in Tommy Handley's popular radio show <span class="italic">ITMA (&#145;It's that Man Again&#146;)</span> which ran until 1949. During the 1950s her popularity increased with her role as Ivy McTweed in the radio adaptation of <span class="italic">The McFlannels</span>, and she enhanced her national profile as Aggie MacDonald, the cook in the radio sitcom <span class="italic">Life with the Lyons</span> (1951&#150;61), which later transferred to television (1955&#150;60).<br>
<br>The move to television made by many actors in the 1950s was a particularly fortuitous one for Weir as her diminutive figure&#151;she was 4 feet 11 inches tall&#151;and her Scots accent made her instantly recognizable. Among her many roles were characters in <span class="italic">Dr Finlay's Casebook</span>, <span class="italic">Hugh and I</span>, <span class="italic">The High Life</span>, <span class="italic">Oh Brother</span>, <span class="italic">Bless this House</span>, and <span class="italic">Visiting Day</span>. The most notable was Hazel the McWitch in the BBC's children's series <span class="italic">Rentaghost</span> (1976&#150;84) that over fifty-eight episodes regularly drew an audience of two million. By the early 1970s she was also well-known for extolling the quality of Flash liquid&#151;a floor and bathroom cleaner&#151;on television adverts. In 1977 she was the guest on <span class="italic">This is your Life</span> with Eamonn Andrews. She made one of her last appearances in Scottish Television's 1996 production of the children's play <span class="italic">The Flowers of the Forest</span>.<br>
<br>In comparison to her radio and television work, Weir's film roles were relatively minor. She first appeared on screen in <span class="italic">Birth-Day</span> (1945), a Ministry of Information film on maternity services. This was followed by, among others, <span class="italic">Floodtide</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Carry on Regardless</span> (1961), <span class="italic">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</span> (1969), Hammer Horror's <span class="italic">Hands of the Ripper</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">One of our Dinosaurs is Missing</span> (1976). Her stage performances were even fewer in number. She made her West End d&eacute;but with Alfred Matthews at the Globe Theatre and followed this with a 1948 production of <span class="italic">The Happiest Days of Your Life</span> with Margaret Rutherford at the Apollo. In Edinburgh she appeared in <span class="italic">Beneath the Wee Red Lums</span> (Royal Lyceum, 1956).<br>
<br>Weir's talents were not confined to acting. She enjoyed a considerable reputation as a public speaker and was a prolific and accomplished writer from the age of fifteen when she had an article accepted by the Glasgow <span class="italic">Evening Times</span>. In addition to radio scripts for programmes such as <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span> and <span class="italic">Home This Afternoon</span>, she was a regular newspaper columnist, and published a cookery book, <span class="italic">Molly Weir's Recipes</span> (1980). Between 1970 (<span class="italic">Shoes were for Sunday</span>) and 1983 (<span class="italic">Spinning like a Peerie</span>) she also published seven volumes of memoirs.<br>
<br>Weir's many roles reflected her dynamic personality; she was often cast as a forceful, witty, acerbic character who displayed a refreshing disregard for authority and the proprieties of social convention. She once arrived for an interview at a fashionable Mayfair patisserie, hair in curlers, covered by a headscarf. She was opposed to what she referred to as &#145;middle-class militancy&#146; and became an outspoken critic of the political campaigning of actors like Vanessa Redgrave. Her life and career could be summed up by her own claim that she had taken careful note of the ten talents in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and that she was determined that not a single talent of hers should wither and die. Voted Scotswoman of the year in 2000, she spent her later years in Pinner, Middlesex. She died following a stroke on 28 November 2004 at Denham Manor nursing home, Halings Lane, Denham, Buckinghamshire. According to her wishes she was cremated and her ashes buried on the banks of Loch Lomond. Her estate of &pound;1.8 million was left mainly to charities.<br>
