<span class="headword">Clutton,  Henry Hugh</span>  (1850&#150;1909), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born on 12 July 1850 at Saffron Walden, Essex, was the third son of Ralph Clutton (1804/5&#150;1886), vicar of that parish, and his wife, Isabella Ellice. Clutton was educated at Marlborough College from 1864 to 1866, when he left on account of ill health. He entered Clare College, Cambridge, in 1869, and graduated BA in 1873, MA and MB in 1879, and MCh in 1897. He commenced clinical studies at St Thomas's Hospital, London, in 1872, and was appointed resident assistant surgeon in 1876, assistant surgeon in 1878, and full surgeon in 1891. While assistant surgeon he took charge of the department for diseases of the ear. Clutton's other appointments in London were as surgeon to the Victoria Hospital for Children at Chelsea from 1887 to 1893, consulting surgeon to Osborne House, and treasurer of the Medical Sickness Annuity and Life Assurance Society and of the Convalescent Homes Association. He was also on the executive committee of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and a visitor for the King Edward's Hospital Fund.<br>
<br>Clutton was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1875, and a fellow in 1876; he served on the council from 1902 until his death, and sat on the senate of the University of London as the college representative. In 1905 he was president of the Clinical Society of London. He married in 1896 Margaret Alice, third daughter of Canon Young, rector of Whitnash, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Clutton was an early supporter of antiseptic and aseptic methods, and of surgery for middle-ear disease. He wrote over sixty-five papers, mainly in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Pathological and of the Clinical Society</span>, and in <span class="italic">St Thomas's Hospital Reports</span>, demonstrating an especial interest in bone and joint diseases. One paper in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>  (13 March 1886, 516), described symmetrical swellings of the knees in children with congenital syphilis. This condition became known as &#145;Clutton's joints&#146;. Clutton wrote on pyaemia in T. Holmes's and J. W. Hulke's <span class="italic">A System of Surgery</span> (1883), and on diseases of the bones and the surgery of deformity in F. Treves's <span class="italic">System of Surgery</span> (1895); he translated material from the German F. von Esmarch's <span class="italic">The Surgeon's Handbook on the Treatment of Wounded in War</span> (1878). He designed urethral sounds and bougies which were known by his name and employed until the 1960s.<br>
<br>In his younger days, Clutton was a fell walker and fisherman, visiting Scotland and Ireland. He read widely on history, art, and architecture, and enjoyed travel. His remarkable endurance and capacity was sapped twelve years before his death by two episodes of septicaemia due to wound infections. After a long illness, alleviated temporarily by an operation, Clutton died at his house, 2 Portland Place, London, on 9 November 1909, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. He was survived by his wife and daughter. An old friend commented:<blockquote>He was a patient, careful and skilled observer; no trouble was too great for him, whether it was required in the pursuit of purely scientific knowledge or in sifting the signs and symptoms at the bed-side &hellip; He was a clear and admirable teacher &hellip; always followed by a keen and appreciative crowd of students. (<span class="italic">St Thomas's Hospital Gazette</span>, 19, 1909, 157&#150;60)</blockquote>
