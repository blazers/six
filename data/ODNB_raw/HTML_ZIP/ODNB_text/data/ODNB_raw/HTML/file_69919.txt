<span class="headword">MacDonald,  James, of Dunyvaig and the Glens</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1565), <span class="occ">clan chief</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69917/', "Alexander MacDonald of Dunyvaig and the Glens (d. 1536x9)")</script> and his wife, Caitirfhiona (Katherine) MacIan of Ardnamurchan. In 1531 his father handed him over as a hostage to James V, who entrusted him to the keeping of William Henderson, a canon of Holyrood. James returned home following his father's death. In 1540 he met the king during the royal expedition to the Isles and gave his brother Coll as a hostage. When Donald Dubh MacDonald escaped from prison in 1543 and claimed the lordship of the Isles, allying himself with England and the earl of Lennox, James MacDonald was almost alone among the chiefs of the Isles in remaining loyal to the Scottish crown (though his brother Angus joined Donald, presumably to safeguard James's interests). In 1544 Lennox ravaged Kintyre, and in the following year Hector Maclean of Duart used his influence with the fourth earl of Argyll to compel James to surrender the Rinns of Islay to him.<br>
<br>Not for the last time MacDonald showed himself to be both acquisitive and politically adroit. In 1545 he was rewarded for his loyalty by the crown with the grant in heritage of lands in north Kintyre which he had formerly leased; together they constituted the barony of Bar. He also settled his father's dispute with Argyll and married the earl's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69172/', "Agnes Campbell")</script>. Then when Donald Dubh died late in 1545 MacDonald at once changed his political stance. His father had held a position akin to that of lord of the Isles, and he himself now aspired to the lordship. To that end he wrote to Henry VIII in January 1546, styling himself &#145;aperand aeyr of the Yllis&#146; and offering to assist Lennox  (Macdonald and Macdonald, 1.388). But when he found he could get little support from the islesmen he soon returned to his Scottish allegiance, while Maclean was induced to return the Rinns of Islay. On 12 October 1550 he purchased Ardnamurchan from Argyll.<br>
<br>MacDonald now turned his attention increasingly to Ireland, where his clansmen were steadily infiltrating Antrim. Some of his cousins who had allied with the English had occupied the Glens of Antrim, but in 1550 these were driven out, and in 1551 MacDonald defeated a retaliatory attack on Rathlin Island. His activities alarmed the English government, and in 1556 he was himself driven from Ulster by the lord deputy, Lord Fitzwalter, from 1557 third earl of Sussex. He returned the next year, and although he defeated Sussex he also tried to make peace, but without success, and in autumn 1558 the English ravaged Arran and Kintyre. The casualties included MacDonald's principal residence, Saddell Castle, granted to him by the earl of Arran two years earlier. Meanwhile Reformation politics had begun to impinge on western Scotland, as Mary of Guise tried to build up James MacDonald, who was a Catholic, as a counterweight to the protestant fifth earl of Argyll. But her efforts failed, as James joined the lords of congregation with 700 foot soldiers.<br>
<br>In September 1562 Queen Mary gave MacDonald a tack of lands in Islay and Kintyre, but during that year he quarrelled with Hector Mor Maclean of Duart, ostensibly over &#145;the slaying of a man&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1545&#150;69</i>, 593), in reality as part of a continuing contest for pre-eminence in the former lordship of the Isles. Argyll tried unsuccessfully to settle their quarrel, which had once more embraced the Rinns of Islay. In July 1563 the two men came before Mary at Glasgow and were instructed to produce their documents. The case was heard on 24 April 1564 and was decided in MacDonald's favour. Meanwhile MacDonald had bought substantial estates in South Uist.<br>
<br>In 1558, when England faced a hostile Franco-Scottish alliance, Sir Henry Sidney expressed fears that James MacDonald would invade Ulster, with native support from as far away as the Dublin pale. In 1563 an English agent even claimed that it was Scottish policy to make James MacDonald &#145;Lord of all the Isles of Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1509&#150;73</i>, 228). This is unlikely&#151;before 1560 the Scottish government had supported James's activities in Ireland, but now England and Scotland were at peace. In any case MacDonald's last expedition across the North Channel was an essentially private affair. In 1565 he raised a large army of mercenaries to attack Shane O'Neill, an ally of the Macleans who was endeavouring to subjugate the MacDonalds in Ulster. Moreover O'Neill had married James's daughter but sent her home as unsuitable. But MacDonald was outmanoeuvred by O'Neill and heavily defeated in Glenshesk near Ballycastle on 2 May. Both he and his youngest brother, Somhairle Buidhe (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17465/', "Sorley Boy MacDonnell")</script>) were captured, and James died of his wounds at Castle Corcke, no later than 25 August. There were rumours that O'Neill had hastened the process. MacDonald's widow, with whom he had had three sons and two daughters, subsequently married Turlough Luineach O'Neill, Shane's cousin. Her first husband was remembered in Irish tradition as &#145;a paragon of hospitality and prowess, a festive man of many troops and a bountiful and munificent man&#146;  (<span class="italic">AFM</span>, 5.1605).<br>
