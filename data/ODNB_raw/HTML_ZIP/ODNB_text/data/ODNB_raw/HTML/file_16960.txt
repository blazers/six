<span class="headword">Long,  Ann</span>  (1681?&#150;1711), <span class="occ">celebrated beauty</span>, was born, probably in 1681, at Draycot Cerne, Wiltshire, the daughter of James Long (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1690) and his wife, Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Strangways. She was the granddaughter of Sir James Long, second baronet (1617&#150;1692), the royalist soldier and politician, and of another leading civil war politician, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38019/', "Giles Strangways (1615&#150;1675)")</script>. She was educated privately and never married. Most of what is known about her comes from Jonathan Swift, who admired her greatly, although their relationship never had the same intensity as those Swift had with Esther Johnson and Esther Vanhomrigh.<br>
<br>Ann Long may have first emerged as a famous figure in London society as early as 1703. She became a toast of the Kit-Cat Club and her name was engraved on the club's drinking glasses by Thomas Wharton, earl of Wharton:<blockquote>
<div>Fill the glass; let Hautboys sound<br>
</div>
<div>Whilst bright Longy's health goes round<br>
</div>
<div>With eternal beauty blest<br>
</div>
<div>Ever blooming, still the best;<br>
</div>
<div>Drink your glass, and think the rest.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>Her closest associate was Catherine Barton (<i>d</i>. 1739), niece of Sir Isaac Newton, who was rumoured to be the mistress of Charles Montagu, earl of Halifax, and later married the politician John Conduitt. She first met Swift in 1707 at the London home of her probable relatives the Vanhomrighs. In December 1707 or January 1708 Swift wrote &#145;A decree for concluding the treaty between Dr Swift and Mrs Long&#146;, published by Edmund Curll in <span class="italic">Letters, Poems and Tales: Amorous, Satyrical, and Gallant</span> in 1718. Her position in society was financially sustained by debts contracted against an inheritance expected from her grandmother Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leach, Lady Long, but Lady Long did not die until 1710. In September of that year Ann Long dissolved her London household and, to hold off her creditors, fled to King's Lynn, Norfolk, where she lived near St Nicholas's Chapel and passed herself off as &#145;being of George Smyth's family of Nitly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift</span>, 1.274). Her grandmother's death did not improve her situation, as her brother Sir James Long, fifth baronet, withheld her legacy.<br>
<br>Ann Long's imprudence with money did not damage Swift's regard for her. He even used her as a confidante in his slowly and tortuously developing passion for Esther Vanhomrigh, his Vanessa. On one occasion, wishing to drop a gentle hint to Vanessa about her behaviour but not wishing to do it openly in case she might be offended, he hit on the device of addressing a letter about her to Ann but sending it via Vanessa, conveniently forgetting to seal the enclosure; thus Vanessa gets to know what he thinks about her but cannot protest or remonstrate, since to do so she would have to confess that she had read his private letter.<br>
<br>Ann Long's life must have become lonely after her exile to King's Lynn, although in her letters to Swift she enjoyed &#145;describing the rituals of provincial life and the mysterious figure that she cut there&#146;  (Nokes, 142). Only once did Swift turn against her, writing on 11 December 1710 that &#145;I had a letter from Mrs. Long, that has quite turned my stomach against her: no less than two nasty jests in it with dashes to suppose them. She is corrupted in that country town with vile conversation&#146;  (Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, 1.118&#150;19).<br>
<br>In late 1711, by careful management of her &pound;100 annuity and &pound;60 rental from &#145;Newburg-house&#146;  (Swift, <span class="italic">Journal to Stella</span>, 2.446) in London, Ann Long had almost paid her debts and hoped to be able to leave King's Lynn. However, she was by this time suffering from asthma and from dropsy, and she died in King's Lynn on 22 December. The news reached Swift in London on 25 December, when he arrived at the Vanhomrighs' house for Christmas dinner: &#145;I never was more afflicted at any death &hellip; She had all sorts of amiable qualities, and no ill ones but the indiscretion of neglecting her own affairs&#146;  (ibid., 2.445&#150;6). Swift suspected that Ann's brother intended to keep her death a secret to avoid the expense of a London funeral or public mourning. A notice of her death was placed by Swift in <span class="italic">The Post-Boy</span> of 27 December. Swift also wrote to the minister of St Nicholas's Chapel, Thomas Pyle, revealing Ann's true identity and asking that she be buried in the church and that a memorial stone be placed there at Swift's expense. Swift's private commemoration of Ann Long, entered in his account book, was perhaps his most eloquent appreciation of her: &#145;She was the most beautifull Person of the Age, she lived in, of great Honr and Virtue, infinite Sweetness and Generosity of Temper and true good Sense&#146;  (ibid., 1.277n.).<br>
