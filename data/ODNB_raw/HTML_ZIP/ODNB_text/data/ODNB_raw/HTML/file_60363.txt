<span class="headword">Burns,  Thomas Ferrier <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1906&#150;1995), <span class="occ">publisher and journalist</span>, was born on 21 April 1906, at Vina del Mar, Chile, the seventh of nine children of David Burns, a Scottish businessman, and his wife, Clara, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Swinburne, a Chilean of Basque and English descent. The family moved to England when Tom was a child. His mother was a Catholic (his Presbyterian father was later received into that church) and he was brought up in his mother's faith. Thus on their return to England he was educated by the Jesuits, first at Wimbledon College, London, and then at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. The twin passions that his parents bequeathed to him and dominated his life&#151;religion and a love of literature&#151;were never private ones. Burns actively promoted Catholicism in various ways and spent most of his life in publishing.<br>
<br>Forgoing the opportunity to go to Oxford or Cambridge, Burns opted to attend the University of Paris (though never taking a degree), wanting to know about the French Catholic &#145;renaissance&#146; and such writers and theologians as Paul Claudel and Jacques Maritain. On returning to London he started work in 1926 with Sheed and Ward, a Catholic publishing house, and in 1936 he joined Longman Green. He moved freely in frequently intertwined literary, artistic, and Catholic circles. For many years he shared his house in Chelsea with the artist David Jones. He became friendly with Graham Greene and commissioned <span class="italic">The Lawless Roads</span> (1939), which provided the material for <span class="italic">The Power and the Glory</span> (1940). His circle also took in Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton, Evelyn Waugh (whom he commissioned to write his life of Edmund Campion and later to edit what was to become Thomas Merton's <span class="italic">Seven Storey Mountain</span>), the artist Eric Gill, and the influential clerics Martin d'Arcy (who had taught him at Stonyhurst) and Ronald Knox.<br>
<br>In 1940 Burns joined the British embassy in Madrid, serving under the ambassador, Sir Samuel Hoare, as press attach&eacute;, a cover that allowed him to straddle the worlds of propaganda, espionage, and diplomacy. Before the war he had supported the fascist rebellion against the Spanish republic (on one occasion he drove an ambulance for the nationalists) and his job at the embassy was both to counter German propaganda and ensure that Franco's neutrality was maintained. Burns's love of Spain, his mother's ancestry, his fluent Spanish, and his religion (not to mention his charm and social skills) equipped him ideally for the task. As well as running spies he hid refugee Jews and escaped prisoners of war. However, his Catholicism and especially his Francoist leanings (he believed that republicanism threatened the church, and that the civil war was not a Hitler-inspired rehearsal for what was to come but a purely Spanish matter) made him enemies within the Foreign Office. Kim Philby, whom he had known in Spain before the war, and Anthony Blunt, both by now well-established Soviet agents, actively sought to undermine him with implications that he was partisan. While in Spain he met and in 1944 married Mabel Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n, daughter of Gregorio Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n, a distinguished writer and doctor. It was a long and happy marriage that produced five children (the first of whom died in infancy).<br>
<br>In 1937 Burns and his friend Douglas Woodruff had combined to buy the ailing Catholic weekly <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> from the archbishop of Westminster, returning it to secular ownership after sixty-eight years. The company they formed, the Tablet Publishing Company, was later subsumed within Burns and Oates, the Catholic publishing company founded by a convert collateral ancestor of Burns. Burns had been a director of the company and became its chairman in 1948. When Woodruff was unseated as editor in 1967 Burns took over. Without journalistic experience, he attracted leading writers (like Greene). In 1971 he bought the magazine personally and in 1976 secured a stable financial footing by the creation of the charitable Tablet Trust. He remained editor until his retirement in 1982.<br>
<br>Burns was politically conservative. He saw that he had come late to recognizing the true nature of Hitler and Mussolini, but he continued to work for international recognition of nationalist Spain. In ecclesiastical affairs, however, he switched the magazine from Woodruff's conservatism to a liberal stance in support of the Second Vatican Council. His deep and personally untroubled attachment to Catholicism never made him slavish toward the church. This was notable when in 1982 <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> opposed <span class="italic">Humanae vitae</span>, Pope Paul VI's encyclical on contraception. Burns alienated many readers, and some clergy banned the magazine's sale in churches. He also gave support to the Nigerian government against the secessionist and largely Catholic Biafra and opposed the British government over the Falklands War.<br>
<br>Burns was appointed OBE in 1983 and in 1993 published an autobiography, <span class="italic">The Use of Memory</span>. He died of cancer of the prostate and colon at his home, flat 7, 36 Buckingham Gate, London, on 8 December 1995, and was survived by his wife, daughter, and three sons (who included the writers and journalists Jimmy Burns and Tom Burns Mara&ntilde;&oacute;n). His requiem mass took place on 11 December 1995 at Westminster Cathedral, and his memorial mass at the church of the Immaculate Conception on 17 January 1996.<br>
