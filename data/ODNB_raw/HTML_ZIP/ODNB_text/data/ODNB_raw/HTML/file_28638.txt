<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walter,  John</span>  (1818&#150;1894), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician</span>, was born on 8 October 1818 at Printing House Square, London, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28637/', "John Walter (1776&#150;1847)")</script> of Printing House Square and his second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smithe, of Eastling, Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36717/', "Sir Edward Walter")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Eton College and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1840 with second-class honours in classics. After taking his MA in 1843 he became a member of Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar in 1847, by which time he had become actively connected with <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He served first as manager in the difficult circumstances which attended the end of the Delane&#150;Alsager joint managership in 1846. He continued in this capacity until he became chief proprietor on the death of his father in July 1847.<br>
<br>It was noted later that Walter had been &#145;trained from birth to exercise a potent and controlling influence in the counsels of a newspaper which his father had raised to the first place in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Nov 1894). His stately progress to this position, however, was not entirely untroubled. The Puseyite sympathies which he had acquired at Oxford led to a disagreement with his father over the editorial line pursued by <span class="italic">The Times</span> on church issues. This rift was sufficiently serious to prompt his temporary withdrawal from managerial duties, but appears to have been short-lived. After he returned <span class="italic">The Times</span> adopted a more open attitude to the Tractarians, though his earnest Anglicanism, growing more robust as he aged, precluded any danger of a drift to Rome. &#145;Popery&#146;, in his view, was &#145;not a fit religion for an Englishman&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 2.46). But he retained throughout his life a high regard for J. H. Newman, whose brother-in-law, Thomas Mozley, was a valued contributor and the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent at the First Vatican Council.<br>
<br>Walter's parliamentary career began at the same time as his proprietorship of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He was returned, along with Feargus O'Connor, the Chartist agitator, as member for Nottingham on 28 July 1847, the day of his father's death. Though he was not unknown to the electors, having sought their favour unsuccessfully in 1843, his victory was remarkable in that it was achieved without the benefit of a personal appearance prior to the polls. A triumphant visit to his constituency after the result had been declared prompted the remark, attributed by Walter to Tyas, a <span class="italic">Times</span> reporter, that he had achieved &#145;more than Caesar &hellip; for he &#147;came, saw and conquered&#148; whilst I never came, nor saw, yet conquered!&#146;  (Walter to Delane, 29 July 1847; Delane&#150;Dasent Correspondence, 2/77). He continued to represent Nottingham until 1859, adopting a &#145;Liberal-Conservative&#146; label and sitting with the Liberals at Westminster. He retired from Nottingham undefeated to seek the Liberal nomination in Berkshire, his home county, which he represented in parliament from 1859 to 1865, and again from 1868 to his retirement in 1885. Over this period he remained attached to free trade and moderate parliamentary reform while retaining a conservative instinct which, at an earlier juncture, would have allowed him to sit comfortably among the Portland whigs. &#145;I am one of those&#146;, he confided, &#145;who are old-fashioned enough to think that the Devil was let loose at the French Revolution &hellip; and that Waterloo was a great act of retributive justice, which was richly deserved&#146;  (Walter to Delane, 6 Dec 1859; Walter MSS, 383).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span>, under Walter's aegis, retained and developed its unique influence. With an average daily circulation of 38,141 in 1850, more than double the combined total of its five metropolitan rivals, it was &#145;unequalled in the breadth and depth of its reporting, the gravity of its tone, the grandeur of its pretensions and its sheer physical bulk&#146;  (Morley, 11). Walter's contribution to its success should not be underestimated, for&#151;the influence of its editors and contributors notwithstanding&#151;he was &#145;in the last resort a deciding voice in the policy and conduct of this journal&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Nov 1894). His editors, notably John Delane, who served from 1847 to 1877, exercised a relatively free hand, but within well-understood parameters reinforced by Walter's close scrutiny of the paper's content and style. For Walter an independent &#145;fourth estate&#146; was a benign and restraining influence in politics and society. Mediating directly between the government and the governed <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in his view, was helping to supply any deficiencies in the representative system and was &#145;therefore more conservative in its effects than any machinery that constitution-mongers can devise&#146;  (Walter to Dasent, 6 Oct 1858; Delane&#150;Dasent correspondence, 9/64).<br>
<br>For most of the half-century in which <span class="italic">The Times</span> was under Walter's control its political influence was underpinned by solid prosperity, and his contribution was especially important in ensuring that this was the case. Innovations in printing technology, in which he took a particular interest, kept <span class="italic">The Times</span> ahead of the field, allowing him to reduce the cover price to 3<i>d</i>. in 1869, increasing average daily circulation by 20,000 at a stroke. The famous Walter press, installed at <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1866, was the outcome of years of patient experimentation begun under Walter's father. From 1848 <span class="italic">The Times</span> was printed on a vertical cylinder press devised by Augustus Applegarth, the chief printer, to meet the demand for a machine that would print 10,000 sheets an hour, but by 1856 Walter had become convinced of the advantages of horizontal cylinders and introduced American-designed Hoe presses at Printing House Square. His correspondence with John Cameron MacDonald, the printing office manager, testifies to Walter's keen interest in this aspect of the business. The most important breakthrough, however, occurred when James Dellagana, an Italian typefounder brought to <span class="italic">The Times</span> by Walter, cast metal stereotypes into papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; moulds. This development, combined with a continuous feeding mechanism, made the press &#145;the wonder of its day&#146;, for it allowed a continuous roll of paper to be printed on both sides from curved stereos as it passed through a series of rotating horizontal cylinders. It was possible, using this revolutionary process, to print 12,000 eight-page papers in an hour. Even so, <span class="italic">The Times</span> from the mid-1860s was eclipsed in circulation by the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>.<br>
<br>The pre-eminence of <span class="italic">The Times</span> among newspapers and the elevated political status which it gained as a consequence attracted significant criticism. In these circumstances Walter sought to establish a distinction between his dual roles as chief proprietor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and member of parliament. When confronted in 1860 by Edward Horsman, the member for Stroud, who had been offended by published comments about the venality of certain MPs, Walter protested that his connection with <span class="italic">The Times</span> was strictly proprietorial, denying &#145;any responsibility on my part for any opinion or statement which it contained&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 158, 1860, col. 761). This was less than convincing, and the question of Walter's potentially conflicting interests surfaced again in 1864 when he supplied information to Lord Robert Cecil which was then used to harass Robert Lowe from office. Although Walter claimed that he had acted, in this instance, solely in his capacity as member for Berkshire, his subsequent private apology to Lowe suggests an uneasy conscience  (Winter, 193). On such occasions his capacity for delicate judgement on matters relating to the interests of <span class="italic">The Times</span> was tested. As he aged, his touch became less certain in this respect. This was most evident in the decision to purchase and then publish letters, subsequently proved to have been forged, which appeared to link Charles Stewart Parnell, the Irish nationalist leader, with the Phoenix Park murders. The notorious &#145;Parnellism and crime&#146; articles, published in 1887, proved an expensive embarrassment for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which had to meet the full cost (&pound;200,000) of the ensuing judicial commission. As a result the healthy financial position which had been established over the years since 1847 was much weakened. As chief proprietor Walter could not escape censure for the fateful decision, though in mitigation it might be noted that the most recent account of this episode is more critical of the editor, George Buckle, and the manager, John Cameron MacDonald  (Woods and Bishop, 157).<br>
<br>John Walter was married twice, first, on 27 September 1842, to Emily Frances Court of Castlemans, Berkshire, with whom he had six sons and one daughter. Widowed in 1858, Walter married again on 1 January 1861; his second wife was Flora MacNabb of Highfield Park, Hampshire, with whom he had a further three sons. &#145;The Griff&#146;, as Walter was known at <span class="italic">The Times</span> since, like a griffin, he was considered both grim and vigilant, retreated to his palatial home on the family estate at Bear Wood, near Wokingham, where he died after a short illness, diagnosed as purpura, on 3 November 1894. He was buried at St Catherine's, Bear Wood. On his death he was succeeded as chief proprietor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56805/', "Arthur Fraser Walter (1846&#150;1910)")</script>, second son of his first marriage.<br>
