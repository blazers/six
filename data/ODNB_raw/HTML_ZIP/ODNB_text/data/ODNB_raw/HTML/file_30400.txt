</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ameer Ali,  Saiyid</span>  (1849&#150;1928), <span class="occ">judge and Muslim leader in India</span>, was born on 6 April 1849 at Chinsura, Bengal, the fourth son of Saiyid Saadat Ali Khan (who died of cholera in 1856) of Mohan, Oudh, and his wife, the daughter of Shamsuddin Khan, landowner, of Sambalpur. Ali's family were Shi&#145;i Muslims who claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah and the eighth iman, Ali Raza; they were prosperous landowners of Persian descent who had come to India with Nadir Shah in 1739 and settled in Oudh. Ali's father had trained as a physician and was scholarly but restless, peripatetic, and apparently dilettante. Influenced by two British officials, he made the crucial decision to give his sons an English education.<br>
<br>Ali attended Hooghly College, where the principal, Robert Thwaytes, became &#145;one of the best friends of my life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 16). He read much in English, graduated with distinction in 1867, and in 1868 was the first Muslim to receive a Calcutta University MA, in history and political economy. He also gained a BL degree. Awarded a Victoria scholarship, he left for England in December 1868, arriving in January 1869.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>The legal profession was at this time the favourite and most lucrative career of Calcutta graduates. Ali was admitted a student of the Inner Temple in May 1870, called to the bar in January 1873, and worked for an English law firm. The welcome and hospitality he received in England made him a lifelong Anglophile. He lived with an English family and was treated as &#145;one of themselves&#146;  (Gordon, 62). He told Napoleon III, whom he met at Brighton in 1872, that he loved England. He arrived with letters of introduction from British friends and from the viceroy, Lord Mayo, was admitted into London society, and then and on later visits to England became friendly with liberal politicians. These included the Fawcetts, whom he accompanied to women's suffrage meetings; journalists, including James Knowles of the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>; Captain Shaw of the London Fire Brigade; Lady Hobhouse; and others. John Bright proposed him for the Reform Club, of which he continued a member for nearly half a century; he used the club's address in later life when writing to <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>In 1873 Ali returned to Calcutta. Of short stature, ambitious and capable, proud of his Saiyid and Persian heritage, he was primarily a Muslim devoted to his religion and his co-religionists: according to a fellow Muslim, he was &#145;a God-intoxicated man who lived by and with the <span class="roman">Qur'an</span>&#146;  (Aziz, vi). He was also a loyalist, who wrote of &#145;the necessity of British rule&#146;  (Gordon, 72). Although resident in Bengal, he never considered himself a Bengali. He spoke Urdu but wrote in English and published almost all his works in London. A Muslim modernist, influenced by Karamat Ali Jawnpuri (<i>d</i>. 1873), he believed that Islam was compatible with modern life and progress, and that Muslims should adopt Western education. He favoured educating Indian women and wanted polygamy prohibited. Indian Muslims were backward in terms of Western education, less literate and with a lower proportion of graduates than the Hindu majority. Ali saw the Hindus as threatening Muslim interests, and the Western-educated Hindus as competing with Muslims for government posts. In February 1873 Ali enrolled as an advocate in the Calcutta high court, and he built up a successful and lucrative practice. A fellow of Calcutta University (1874), he was a part-time lecturer on Muslim law (1875&#150;9) and Tagore law professor (1884).<br>
<br>Ali believed that the condition of Muslims in India had declined, and that their fortunes could not be revived by their efforts alone; they needed government help, and to gain this they required their own political organization. In May 1877 he founded the Central National Mahommedan Association, of which he was secretary until 1890. A loyalist Muslim pressure group, asserting Muslim interests and wanting government posts filled by nomination not competitive examinations, this organization had members who were largely notables, mostly non-Bengali, and by 1888 it had more than fifty branches in different parts of India. In 1882 it presented a memorial, written by Ali, to the viceroy, Lord Ripon, requesting appointment of more Muslims to government service and more government assistance to Western education of Muslims, and alleging that Hindu prejudicial treatment often prevented Muslims from advancing. Like Sir Saiyid Ahmad Khan, Ali opposed the Indian National Congress, regarding it as a Hindu organization inimical to Muslim interests. The &#145;Congress-wallahs&#146;, especially Surendranath Banerjea and his <span class="italic">Bengalee</span>, criticized Ali. In 1883&#150;4 Wilfrid Scawen Blunt visited India and was entertained by Ali. Later, in his book <span class="italic">India under Ripon</span>, he alleged that Ali fawned on the British and let down his compatriots. Ali wrote that Blunt had traduced and misrepresented him.<br>
<br>Ali was presidency magistrate from 1878, and chief magistrate from 1879 to 1881. He was a member of the Bengal legislative council from 1878 to 1883. A continuing issue was the relationship of the ryots (tenant farmers) with the <i>zamindars</i> (landlords) and officials' attempts to protect the former from the latter. The <span class="roman">Bengal Tenancy Bill</span> (1882), intended to protect ryots, aroused <i>zamindari</i> opposition and divided the legislative council, with Indian non-officials including Ali advocating the <i>zamindars</i>' cause and the lieutenant-governor and other British officials arguing for the ryots. Although diluted in favour of the <i>zamindars</i>, the <span class="roman">Bengal Tenancy Act</span> (1885) was an important change in tenancy legislation. Babu (later Raja) Peary Mohan Mookerjee, the champion of the landlords, complimented Ali on his consideration for them.<br>
<br>In England in July 1880 Ali met &#145;the lady of my dreams&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 50), Isabelle Ida, second daughter of Heyman Konstam of 64 Gloucester Place, London, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57056/', "Gertrude Kingston (1862&#150;1937)")</script>, the actress. They married on 21 October 1884 at the Unitarian church, Little Portland Street, London, and among the guests were Lord Stanley and Sir Ashley Eden. They had two sons. Ali's wife survived him. Their elder son (Saiyid) Waris (1886&#150;1975), Wellington and Balliol, became a member of the Indian Civil Service and shot for India at Bisley. Their younger son, Sir Torick (1891&#150;1975), Marlborough and Christ Church, became a Bengal high court judge. Both had British wives and retired to England.<h2>
<a name="Highcourtjudgeandjudgetotheprivycouncil"></a>High court judge and judge to the privy council</h2>From 1883 to 1885 Ali was a member of the viceroy's legislative council. He contributed to negotiating a compromise on the controversial <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span> (1883). In 1887 he was made CIE. Recommended by Sir Courtney Ilbert, he was a Calcutta high court judge from 1890 to 1904. He was the second Muslim appointed, and some considered his appointment political. Reportedly his merits as a judge were obscured by a conversational manner in court and a tendency to prolixity in judgment&#151;superficial faults which increased with advancing years. He gave judgments of far-reaching importance including <i>Imambandi v. Mutsaddi</i> in Muslim law, <i>Ramachandra v. Vinayak</i>, <i>Buddha Singh v. Laltu Singh</i>, and <i>Girjabai v. Sadashiv</i> in Hindu law. Nevertheless Curzon did not have a high opinion of him as a judge. His publications included <span class="italic">Personal Law of the Mahommedans</span> (1880) and <span class="italic">Mahommedan Law</span> (2 vols., 1880 and 1884, and later editions).<br>
<br>During his judgeship Ali spent his vacations in England, and following his retirement in 1904 he settled there, residing at The Lambdens, near Theale, Berkshire, and later at his &#145;beautiful home&#146;, Pollingfold Manor, near Rudgwick, Sussex. He continued actively concerned with Muslim and Indian affairs. He was for some years chairman of the Woking mosque committee, and in 1910 was involved in the project, not then successful, of a London mosque. Muslims supported Curzon's partition in 1905 of Bengal and his creation of a Muslim-majority province. Ali praised Curzon and wrote to him expressing &#145;great regret&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 72) at his resignation. During the Swadeshi period Ali supported the forces of order and wanted firmer government action lest the government's authority be lost.<br>
<br>In 1905 the Unionist government appointed Lord Minto viceroy, and in the new Liberal government John Morley became secretary of state for India. Under pressure from the Hindu-dominated Indian National Congress, the administration wanted to introduce reforms, including more representative government. Alarmed at the perceived Hindu threat, Muslim leaders requested separate communal representation. In October 1906 a Muslim delegation, led by the Aga Khan, attended the viceroy, who agreed to their request for separate representation, more than proportional to their numbers. In December 1906 at Dacca the All-India Muslim League was established, with the Aga Khan as president. In May 1908 Ali and others established a London branch, with Ali as president, which had an important role in the following years. Morley agreed to separate representation but wanted a system of electoral colleges which Ali and other Muslims opposed, and there was further controversy and agitation, in which Ali took a leading role. In January 1909 he led a deputation to Morley. Finally Morley agreed to separate representation without electoral colleges and disproportional to numbers. So in the <span class="roman">Indian Councils Act</span> (1909) essentially the Muslims gained what they wanted, and thereafter the communal electoral system was a continuing feature of the raj. Neither Morley nor Minto thought highly of Ali. Morley wrote that he was &#145;a vain creature, with a certain gift of length&#146;  (Koss, 145), eager for a KCSI, a &#145;windbag&#146; and &#145;conceited egotist&#146;  (Wasti, 183). Minto alleged he was frustrated at not being knighted. Nevertheless Morley, having decided to appoint an Indian judge to the privy council, appointed Ali to this unsalaried and onerous post in 1909. The first Indian member of the privy council, he applied himself keenly to the work of the judicial committee and attended Indian appeals almost until his death. In 1913 he resigned from the Muslim League, regarding it as too extreme.<br>
<br>Like other Indian Shi&#145;a, Ali supported the Sunni Ottoman caliphate, which he accepted as a &#145;pontifical&#146; or temporal caliphate. In India his pan-Islamism was quiescent, but in England he was more active. He supported the Turks in the Italo-Turkish War (1911&#150;12), and with others formed the British Red Crescent which helped the Turks. However, in the First World War he was loyal to the British empire, and the Red Crescent supplied a motor field ambulance for Flanders and comforts to Indian troops there. After the war he unintentionally contributed to the abolition of the caliphate. In 1922 the new Turkish assembly abolished the sultanate but elected a new caliph without secular power. In late 1923 the Aga Khan and Ali wrote to the Turkish prime minister requesting enhancement of the caliph's position. This alarmed the Turkish government, which allegedly suspected a British plot, and gave Mustafa Kemal (Atat&uuml;rk) his opportunity: he instigated the assembly's abolition of the caliphate in 1924. Latterly Ali mournfully reproached the Turks, whom for so many years he had defended in Britain.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>A Muslim modernist and orthodox Shi&#145;i, Ali was in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries a leading polemicist of Islam. His message was both for his co-religionists and for the British. In his publications, notably his <span class="italic">Spirit of Islam</span> (1891), developed from his <span class="italic">A Critical Examination of the Life and Teaching of Mohammed</span> (1873), and his <span class="italic">Short History of the Saracens</span> (1899), partly derived from Gibbon's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall</span>, both much reprinted, he restated the history of Islam for the West, and he influenced both British readers and Western-educated Muslims in India and Egypt. Like other modernists, he claimed that some Koranic injunctions were relevant only to the prophet's period, though his angelology was cautiously traditional. He argued that Christianity was an &#145;incomplete religion&#146; and Islam the final stage in the evolution of religion. He claimed that it was superior to Christianity and Hinduism, dismissing the latter as idolatry and fetishism. He idealized the orthodox caliphate of the first four caliphs, and claimed the Muslim failure to conquer Europe was a tragedy, limiting its civilizing mission. He claimed &#145;the real history of India commences with the entry of the Mussulmans&#146;  (Gordon, 70), and that they brought culture to an idolatrous and backward land.<br>
<br>Ali was awarded honorary doctorates by Cambridge, Calcutta, and Aligarh universities. Following diabetes and a heart attack, he died on 3 August 1928 at his residence, Pollingfold Manor, near Rudgwick, Sussex, and was buried on 7 August at Brookwood cemetery, Surrey. After his death his widow and son compiled from his notes his &#145;Memoirs&#146;, which exaggerated the significance of his political role, and were published in <span class="italic">Islamic Culture</span> in 1931 and 1932. He has been called &#145;one of the greatest Muslims of India&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, vii). Although he died before the concept of Pakistan developed in the 1930s, his Muslim separatism contributed to Pakistan's emergence. With Muslim separatism and partition probably the most contentious subjects in the historiography of the sub-continent, opinions on Saiyid Ameer Ali continue to differ.<br>
