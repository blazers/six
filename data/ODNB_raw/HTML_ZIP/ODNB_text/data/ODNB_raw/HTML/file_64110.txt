<span class="headword">Bond,  Nathaniel</span>  (1754&#150;1823), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 1 November 1754 at Creech Grange, Isle of Purbeck, the second surviving of seven children, including four sons, of John Bond (1717&#150;1784), landowner and politician, and his wife, Mary (1717&#150;1787), daughter of Edmund Dummer of Swaythling, Hampshire. He was educated together with his elder brother John at Winchester College (from in or before 1766), Magdalene College, Cambridge, (from 1771), and the Inner Temple (1773), where Nathaniel was called to the bar in 1779. He served as recorder of Dorchester from 1781 to 1806 and enjoyed a king's bench and western circuit practice; he became KC in 1795, and held the offices of bencher, reader, and treasurer of his inn (1795&#150;1801). He was about to retire from the law but his friend Joseph Jekyll dissuaded him, recommending &#145;bustle&#146; to his &#145;bilious, nervous&#146; colleague, on 22 December 1800  (Dorset RO, Bond MSS, D367). John Bond opportunely vacated the family's parliamentary seat for Corfe Castle when Pitt resigned, and Nathaniel was elected at the subsequent by-election on 25 February 1801.<br>
<br>Bond's prospects seemed good, for his school friend Henry Addington was then premier, and in March he was seated at the Treasury board. He declined the Irish chief secretaryship in February 1802, pleading illness: he feared overwork. His maiden speech, on 14 May, eulogized the Amiens peace treaty. He part-framed and defended the Nottingham election and police bills in debate in 1803, and rumour designated him secretary at war. In reality he was sworn of the privy council on 23 November 1803, and was again offered the Irish chief secretaryship, which he again declined in January 1804. He became vice-president of the Board of Trade on 8 February, but lost office in June after Pitt's restoration.<br>
<br>Like Addington, Bond opposed Pitt, who courted him in October 1804 after George III, having met Bond at Weymouth, suggested him as the next judge-advocate-general. Bond demurred until Addington, by now Lord Sidmouth, rejoined Pitt and solicited for him. He anticipated becoming judge-advocate until the reconciliation between Pitt and Sidmouth faltered. Changing tack, he supported criminal inquiry into naval maladministration on 2 May 1805, but opposed Lord Melville's impeachment; his successful amendment on 12 June for prosecution by the attorney-general, was, however, subsequently overthrown. Pitt's refusal to place Bond, who waived office, and Hiley Addington, brother of the former prime minister, on 27 June ruptured the merger. Bond reluctantly became judge-advocate in Grenville's ministry on 8 March 1806, after he had defended Lord Chancellor Ellenborough's cabinet seat in debate on 3 March. Daunted by William Windham's War Office memorandum awarding the duke of York, commander-in-chief, sole access to the king on all courts martial, Bond offered to resign in June. When a participatory role for him was concocted, he capitulated on 24 July, despite suffering from deteriorating eyesight.<br>
<br>Bond did not seek re-election in 1807. In November he resigned from office, overwrought and aware that his likely successor, Richard Ryder, had royal approval. He retired to East Holme, Dorset, which he had inherited from his uncle Nathaniel. In better health, he occasionally contacted Sidmouth to discuss current political issues. He died at East Holme, unmarried, on 8 October 1823 and was buried at Steeple, Dorset, on 15 October. He left East Holme to his namesake nephew.<br>
