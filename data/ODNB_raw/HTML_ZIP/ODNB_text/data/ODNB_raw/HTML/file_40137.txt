<span class="headword">Dickson, Sir  William Forster</span>  (1898&#150;1987), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born in Northwood, Middlesex, on 24 September 1898, the only child of Campbell Cameron Forster Dickson, solicitor, and his wife, Agnes Nelson-Ward, a direct descendant of Lord Nelson. He was educated at Haileybury College, Hertfordshire, and joined the Royal Naval Air Service in 1916. After training as a pilot he served with the Grand Fleet aboard the aircraft-carrier <i>Furious</i>, where he pioneered deck landings and participated in the first carrier-based bombing raid, earning appointment to the DSO (1918). After the war he became a flying instructor in the newly independent Royal Air Force and flew as a test pilot, being awarded the AFC (1922). Then, after working in the Air Ministry (1923&#150;6) as the expert on naval/air operations for Sir Hugh Trenchard, he flew with 56 squadron (1926&#150;7), attended the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover (1927&#150;8), spent several years in India, commanded 25 squadron (1935&#150;6), and thoroughly enjoyed three years on the directing staff at Andover (1936&#150;8), where he proved a fine instructor. In 1932 he had married Patricia Marguerite, sister of Sir George (Gubby) Allen, cricketer, and daughter of Sir Walter Macarthur Allen, commandant-in-chief of the metropolitan special constabulary. They had two daughters, one of whom died in childhood in 1952.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war, having attended the Imperial Defence College (1939), Dickson was called upon to use his exceptional staff skills in the joint planning staff, first as group captain (1940) and then as air commodore (1941). He contributed greatly to the forward planning in the early years of the war, working directly for Winston Churchill and the chiefs of staff, joining in meetings with the Soviet ambassador to discuss military aid, and attending the Arcadia conference, where the future Anglo-American strategy was decided. After a year (1942&#150;3) in Fighter Command (as air vice-marshal) he spent another year (1943&#150;4) preparing 83 group for the Normandy invasion, whereupon General Montgomery insisted that the group be handed over to Harry Broadhurst, the commander whom he knew. Dickson, accepting the inevitable disappointment with good grace, departed for Italy to command the desert air force, and for most of 1944 ably directed its intensive interdiction and close army support operations.<br>
<br>At the end of the year Dickson returned to London as assistant chief of air staff (policy); in June 1946 he was promoted air marshal and joined the Air Council as vice-chief of air staff, working under Lord Tedder and devoting much of his attention to the RAF's post-war re-equipment programme; and in March 1948 he became commander-in-chief in the Middle East. A year later he was criticized in parliament after four reconnaissance Spitfires had been shot down by the Israelis, but Clement Attlee, the prime minister, firmly defended him over what had been essentially a political air operation. Dickson returned to the Air Ministry in March 1950, as air member for supply and organization. Central to his work was the expansion programme necessitated by the Korean War, and he also negotiated an agreement with his American counterpart to cover the deployment of a large American air force contingent in the United Kingdom.<br>
<br>Dickson became chief of air staff on 1 January 1953. Churchill, again prime minister, remembered him well from wartime and fully supported him in his prime task: the planning and preparation for the RAF's nuclear deterrent. Recognizing the increasing importance of cold war operations Dickson also pressed forward the development of the air transport force, but was ever mindful of the growing economic pressures on the RAF's budget. He became marshal of the Royal Air Force in 1954. Then, on 1 January 1956, Sir Anthony Eden, now prime minister, appointed him to the new position of separate chairman of the chiefs of staff. Dickson, convinced of the need for a stronger &#145;centre&#146; in the Ministry of Defence, readily accepted the post, which he held throughout the Suez crisis of 1956 and the subsequent defence review by Duncan Sandys; unable to exercise much influence during this controversial debate he supported the proposal by Harold Macmillan in 1958 to convert his post to chief of defence staff. On 1 January 1959 he became the first incumbent, handing over to Lord Mountbatten of Burma six months later.<br>
<br>Dickson had served at the top of the defence hierarchy for six and a half years, at a time of turmoil, defence cuts, and post-Suez reforms in the armed services. While short of stature, he always commanded attention, combining a razor-sharp brain with a great sense of fun. His sense of humour often defused awkward situations. His love of flying had enamoured him of the RAF, but he retained deep respect for the other services and was seen as an ideal choice for Britain's first chief of defence staff. In retirement at Cold Ash, near Newbury, Berkshire, his interests included the Royal Central Asian Society, the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society, and the Forces Help Society and Lord Roberts Workshops; he also loved to play golf. He was appointed OBE (1934), CB (1942), CBE (1945), KBE (1946), KCB (1952), and GCB (1953). William Dickson died on 12 September 1987 at the Royal Air Force Hospital, Wroughton, Wiltshire.<br>
