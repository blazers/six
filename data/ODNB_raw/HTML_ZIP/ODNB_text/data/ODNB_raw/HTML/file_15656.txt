<span class="headword">Kirkby,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1352), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, is first recorded in 1312, as a canon of the Augustinian priory of Carlisle. Like most of his fellows, he was probably a native of north-west England. Nothing is known of his education, though he is recorded as lending books on canon and civil law. He was ordained priest on 23 March 1314, suggesting that he was at least twenty-five by then. No later than 1330, and probably in 1325, he was elected prior. His priorate was marked by a series of disputes with Bishop John Ross, during which both he and the canons of Carlisle Cathedral were excommunicated. However, when Ross died in 1332, Kirkby was elected to succeed him. Royal assent was granted on 18 May, Archbishop Melton of York confirmed the election on 2 July, and the temporalities were restored a week later. He was consecrated by Melton on 19 July. The see had been reserved to the pope, but on 4 December 1333 John XXII confirmed Kirkby as bishop. Kirkby had already, on 9 October 1333, undertaken to revoke his predecessor's sentences of excommunication, and at the same time he confirmed the priory in its rights and tithes.<br>
<br>Throughout his episcopate Kirkby was closely involved in border affairs. He may have accompanied Sir Anthony Lucy on a raid into the Scottish west march in March 1333&#151;the two were subsequently in dispute with Ranulf Dacre, sheriff of Cumberland, over the ransom of two prisoners. At Newcastle on 12 June 1334 he witnessed Edward Balliol's homage to Edward III for the Scottish crown. In July 1335, with a retinue of forty men-at-arms, he joined the army with which Edward III invaded Scotland from Carlisle. For the campaign of 1337, having contracted to serve under Thomas Beauchamp, eleventh earl of Warwick, he took part in an attack upon Teviotdale, Moffatdale, and Nithsdale in September, and then in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept a Scottish force raiding Redesdale and Coquetdale. Such activities, according to the Lanercost chronicle, earned for Kirkby the particular hatred of the Scots, and when they raided Cumberland in October that year, they singled out his manor of Rose (which he had received licence to crenellate in April 1336) for destruction. In November he joined the force relieving Edinburgh Castle, but excused himself from further participation in that year's campaigning, on the grounds of the harm he had suffered at the hands of the Scots, and of his lack of a retinue. For the same reason he petitioned the king in the following spring for a life grant of the keepership of Carlisle Castle. The custody was granted during pleasure in June 1339, and Kirkby held it only intermittently until 1345. He also contracted to supply soldiers to Edward Balliol's command, and in 1343 was appointed a keeper of the truce with Scotland.<br>
<br>Although he attended a number of parliaments in the early 1340s, for much of his episcopate Kirkby resided in his diocese, where he made at least two visitations, and was assiduous in conducting ordinations. Even so, he would appear at first sight to have been hardly more popular with his flock than he was with the Scots. Attacks on the bishop and his men were reported in 1333 and 1337, while on 31 July 1345 a violent disturbance broke out in Carlisle between the citizens and the castle garrison, during which the soldiers, allegedly with Kirkby's connivance, set upon the townsfolk and killed four of them, including one of the city bailiffs. Kirkby lost his custody of Carlisle Castle as a result of this riot. He also engaged in a prolonged dispute with his archdeacon, while a visitation of his diocese in 1338 led to altercations with a number of monastic houses over their claims to advowsons. It is possible that some, at least, of this apparent quarrelsomeness was the result of Kirkby's efforts to recover ground lost under his two predecessors, bishops Halton and Ross, through either their ill health or the disorder arising from Scottish attacks. Not all of it proved disadvantageous to his see; indeed, a lawsuit with Ross's executors led in 1347 to a judgment which stands to this day, laying down that the ornaments of a deceased bishop's chapel belong to his diocese, and not to his personal estate.<br>
<br>By then Kirkby had resumed his career as a soldier. About Easter 1345, having joined forces with Sir Thomas Lucy and Sir Robert Ogle to confront a Scottish invasion led by Sir William Douglas, he was unhorsed and nearly captured in a conflict that ended in the rout of the Scots. In March 1346 he was appointed a warden of the west march. However, it is unclear whether he fought at Nevilles Cross on 17 October following&#151;the chronicler Geoffrey Baker's claim that he was present is not confirmed by other sources. Early in 1348 he was commissioned to accompany the king's daughter Joan to Spain, for her marriage to the future Pedro I of Castile, but she died of plague at Bordeaux in September. Kirkby himself was presumed to be back in his diocese by April 1349, when Archbishop Zouche of York sent him instructions concerning the spiritual precautions he was to take there against the black death. But his register contains no entries after 2 June 1347, and his whereabouts when he died, on 23 November 1352, went unrecorded.<br>
