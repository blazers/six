<span class="headword">Speke,  George</span>  (1623&#150;1689), <span class="occ">politician and political activist</span>, was born on 1 May 1623, the eldest son of George Speke (<i>d</i>. 1637), landowner, and his wife, Joan, daughter of Sir John Portman, first baronet, of Orchard Portman. Speke's ancestors were Devon knights who came into possession of the manor house at White Lackington parish in Ilminster, Somerset, in the mid-fifteenth century. Through royal service to the Tudors the family had prospered and although they lost their influence at court in the seventeenth century they remained powerful within Somerset. When he was thirteen Speke's father died and his wardship was sold to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37872/', "Sir Robert Pye")</script> of Faringdon, Berkshire, for &pound;1800. Speke travelled abroad in 1639, and on 21 May 1641, at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, he married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67750/', "Mary Speke")</script>, Sir Robert Pye's eldest daughter. George and Mary Speke had six sons and three daughters. Of their nine children three died young: their eldest son, George; the second youngest son, Thomas; and their youngest daughter, Elizabeth. Their youngest son, William, of Shipton Beauchamp, did not engage in political affairs. Their other children, Philip, John, Hugh, Mary, and Charles all followed their parents' politics.<br>
<br>During the civil wars Speke supported the king, sending Prince Rupert a thousand broad pieces during the siege of Bridgwater and raising regiments of horse and foot for the royal cause. After the fall of Bridgwater in July 1645, Speke was taken prisoner by Sir Thomas Fairfax and his goods were sequestrated. Through the intervention of his brother-in-law, Colonel Robert Pye, a New Model Army officer, Speke was able to win his freedom although he paid a large fine of &pound;2390. Speke remained under suspicion during the interregnum. He was imprisoned again in 1655 for possible complicity in a royalist conspiracy and two years later was required to rebuild with his own resources a hospital that had been demolished in the &#145;late troubles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Exeter MSS</span>, 279).<br>
<br>Shortly after the Restoration, Speke became an outspoken critic of Charles II. His conversion to the politics of opposition was undoubtedly influenced by his strong-willed wife, Mary. She, like her parliamentarian brother Colonel Pye, was a presbyterian. In 1663 Mary was arrested at a conventicle. To his dismay Speke soon found that neither his royalist credentials nor his authority as a deputy lieutenant and a JP could protect her. Indeed, having publicly declared that he would not disturb any presbyterian meetings he was dismissed as JP. Speke and his wife supported various dissenting preachers and a conventicle at White Lackington House, which became known as a &#145;receptacle for all the malcontents&#146; in the heated atmosphere of the 1670s and 1680s  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 8).<br>
<br>Along with three of his sons, John, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26100/', "Hugh Speke")</script>, and Charles, Speke joined the notorious whig <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script>. He was elected a knight of shire for Somerset in the second election of 1679 and sat in the short-lived third Exclusion Parliament of 1681. Although he left no traces in the records of his parliamentary activity his obnoxious behaviour in the west, where he and his family were known as &#145;grand fanatics&#146;, left little doubt as to where he stood  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 16). Following his election in 1679 he supposedly declared that he &#145;would not fight for the Duke of York, who was a Papist, but for the Duke of Monmouth, who was a Protestant&#146; and that he could furnish Monmouth with men and arms. Speke was called before Charles II to answer for his comments. In his defence he reminded the king that he had been a &#145;great sufferer&#146; in Charles I's cause and that he wished only to defend the protestant religion  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 690&#150;91). Apparently Speke was forgiven but the encounter served only to further embolden him. In May 1680 his son John described his father's behaviour in a letter to his brother Hugh: &#145;Since his return, notwithstanding the numberless entreaties and advices to be silent and not concern himself with public affairs, he gives himself more liberty, and talks more at random and dangerous than formerly&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1679&#150;80</i>, 471).<br>
<br>Speke was notorious for his violent talk and the government had no trouble compiling a list of &#145;abusive and scandalous expressions&#146; uttered by Speke to anyone who would listen. Following the death of the earl of Essex in the Tower in 1683 he told his neighbours the earl had been murdered. When one neighbour argued with Speke he called him a &#145;Cursed Tory and struck him in the face with a stick&#146;. He also supposedly declared &#145;that the nation was governed by a company of whores&#146;, and that the king &#145;was no more fit to govern than an ass&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 430&#150;31). On another occasion Speke asserted that all &#145;the bishops were popishly affected and the betrayers of their country&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1683&#150;4</i>, 1). Upon the discovery of the Rye House plot in June 1683, &#145;old Mr. Speke&#146; came under suspicion and was ordered to come to London. A few months later, in October, Speke absconded, possibly to the Netherlands, &#145;for horrible words&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>Jan&#150;June 1683</i>, 363; <i>1683&#150;4</i>, 20). His house was searched time and again for arms and papers throughout 1683 and even the house of his mother, &#145;a rigid sectarian&#146;, was searched although little was uncovered  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 212&#150;13).<br>
<br>By a marriage licence dated 10 November 1682 George Speke married his second daughter, who had the unusual name of Philip [<a name="cosubject_67749"></a><span class="headword">Philip Trenchard</span>  (1663/4&#150;1743)<span class="occ"></span>], to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27705/', "John Trenchard (1649&#150;1695)")</script>, politician, fourth son of Thomas Trenchard of Wolverton, Dorset. She was eighteen; he was thirty-three. While the Spekes and the Trenchards had intermarried throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, George and Mary were particularly fond of John Trenchard, who lived at Lytchett Matravers, Dorset, but was often at White Lackington and an intimate with their sons. Trenchard was one of the pall bearers at the funeral of the Spekes' youngest daughter, Elizabeth, who died in 1681. John Trenchard's politics certainly matched those of the Spekes. He had acted as the chairman of the Green Ribbon Club and was deeply implicated in the Rye House plot. When Speke was questioned by a neighbour for marrying his daughter to Trenchard he exclaimed &#145;my son Trenchard is so brave and forward a man that I do not question but to see him Lord Chancellor in a little time&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 430). Like her mother and sister Philip frequented conventicles. She also stayed as a close prisoner with her husband in the Tower when he was arrested in 1683 and later followed him to Amsterdam during his exile.<br>
<br>In early 1685 George Speke was arrested and heavily fined for creating a riot in order to rescue Trenchard from the custody of a messenger. A few months later the Spekes were involved in Monmouth's rebellion. Trenchard was at White Lackington when he received notice of Monmouth's landing at Lyme Regis. Recognizing the dangers ahead he prepared to flee to the continent, urging the Spekes to join him. Instead, George and Mary spread the good news of Monmouth's coming and sent him encouragement and support. But shortly afterwards Speke fled to Utrecht. He, his wife, son John and daughter Mary were all exempted from James II's general pardon of March 1686. Speke eventually obtained a pardon for himself and his family for a fine of &pound;8000 in February 1687. Not surprisingly he joined William of Orange's march to London in November 1688. Speke unsuccessfully petitioned the House of Commons twice in 1689 for financial compensation for the losses his family had incurred under James II. He died in debt on 2 December 1689. Philip and John Trenchard had four sons and three daughters. The only son to survive into adulthood, George, sat for Poole in the House of Commons as a whig from 1713 to 1754. John Trenchard died of consumption in 1695. Philip, who lived until 1743, married Daniel Sadler, esquire, of London, in 1701 although she continued to use Trenchard as her surname.<br>
<br>Speke's eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_67748"></a><span class="headword">John Speke</span>  (1651/2&#150;1728), <span class="occ">politician and Monmouth rebel</span>, matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 6 April 1666 aged fourteen, entered Lincoln's Inn in 1669, and travelled abroad in 1671. He married Katherine, daughter of Edmund Prideaux of Forde Abbey, Devon, a family with which the Spekes had close ties. They had no children. In 1679 John Speke was one of the deputy lieutenants for Somerset. He was returned for Ilchester in the first election of 1679, was listed as &#145;honest&#146; by the earl of Shaftesbury, and voted for the bill to exclude the duke of York from the throne. John was friendly with the notorious informer Titus Oates and, along with his brother Hugh, he was probably involved in fomenting the Popish Plot. He was elected again for Ilchester in August 1679 but failed to be re-elected in 1681. In June 1685 John Speke joined Monmouth's rebellion, riding to Chard with a group of &#145;ordinary fellows&#146; to link up with the duke's army  (BL, Lansdowne MS 11, 52A, fol. 240). Monmouth made him a colonel with his own regiment. Other rebels later ridiculed John as a &#145;silly and insignificant man&#146;, who &#145;gave orders to his regiment from the top of a tree with his handkerchief&#146; during battle  (BL, Add. MS 41819, fol. 58). At Frome John learned that James II had issued a general pardon for all those who laid down their arms and so he stole away from Monmouth's camp at night and escaped to Amsterdam. In 1687, with the help of Trenchard, John secured a pardon and willingly co-operated with James's administration. On 25 June 1687 John, now a widower, married Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Robert Pelham of Compton Valence, Dorset. They had one son. In 1688 he was deemed a suitable court candidate for Ilchester but following the prince of Orange's invasion he failed to win election to the Convention. He did sit as a whig in 1690 and 1695 and signed the Association in 1696. He died in 1728. His son George carried on the family's whig tradition in parliament in 1722 and 1747.<br>
<br>The Spekes' eldest daughter, <a name="cosubject_67751"></a><span class="headword">Mary Jennings</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1649?), <span class="occ">Monmouth supporter</span>, married a Quaker, Thomas Jennings, of Burton Pynsent in Curry Rivel, Somerset, son of Marmaduke Jennings and Elizabeth (formerly Trevilian). They had three children, Thomas, Mary, and Elizabeth. After her husband died in 1680 Mary as, &#145;the widow Jennings&#146;, remained in close contact with her family and was known as an outspoken critic of the government. When Monmouth's band marched through Taunton in 1685 she sent him four horses, and the Quaker John Whiting who visited her at the time, later wrote that she &#145;was all afloat about the Duke [of Monmouth], thinking the day was their own&#146;  (Whiting, 141). Mary was exempted from James II's general pardon of 1686 for supporting Monmouth. It is not known when she died.<br>
<br>The Spekes' third son, <a name="cosubject_67747"></a><span class="headword">Charles Speke</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">political activist</span>, was not as deeply involved in whig politics as his elder brothers, John and Hugh, but he did join the Green Ribbon Club and was a dissenter. He also read and spread whig propaganda. On 6 August 1677 Charles was admitted to Lincoln's Inn and although never called to the bar, in the early 1680s he had an office and chambers in Lincoln's Inn and purchased the office of filazer (filing writs) for several western counties for the hefty sum of &pound;3000. In June 1685 Charles apparently shook hands with Monmouth as he passed through Ilminster although he did not join the rebellion. His obeisance to Monmouth was enough later to have him imprisoned and Judge Jeffreys sentenced him to death for treason at Wells in late September 1685. When Jeffreys was informed that there were two Spekes and that he had convicted the wrong Speke brother Jeffreys supposedly replied, &#145;His family owes a life and he shall die for his namesake&#146;  (Roberts, 2.222). Charles was hanged in September or October in the market place, Ilminster, from a large tree. His attainder was reversed after the revolution of 1688. He was remembered in the whig martyrologies of the post-revolution era as a young man who &#145;came from that good pious family which always have been opposers to popery and suffered deeply for their courage that way&#146;  (Tutchin, 34).<br>
