<span class="headword">Reid,  Forrest</span>  (1875&#150;1947), <span class="occ">novelist and literary scholar</span>, born at 20 Mount Charles, Belfast, on 24 June 1875, was the sixth and youngest son of Robert Reid (1825&#150;1881), manager of a felt works, who came from a well-established upper-middle-class Ulster family, and his second wife, Frances Matilda Parr (<i>d</i>. 1901), a collateral descendant of the sixth wife of Henry VIII. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. After some years as apprentice in the tea trade, he went to Christ's College, Cambridge, at the age of thirty and took his degree in 1908 with a second class in the medieval and modern languages tripos. He then settled down to write in Belfast, which, apart from periods of travel, remained his home for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Reid wrote sixteen novels, two volumes of autobiography, two collections of short stories, critical studies of W. B. Yeats and Walter de la Mare, and a definitive work on the book illustrators of the 1860s and numerous essays and book reviews. The novels fall into two fairly distinct groups. The first includes the books written before the publication of his first volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">Apostate</span>, in 1926. These include his first published book, <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Twilight</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The Garden God</span> (1905), <span class="italic">The Bracknels</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Following Darkness</span> (1912), <span class="italic">The Gentle Lover</span> (1913), <span class="italic">At the Door of the Gate</span> (1915), <span class="italic">The Spring Song</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Pirates of the Spring</span> (1919), and <span class="italic">Pender among the Residents</span> (1922). Of most of these Reid himself had a low opinion, considering them &#145;false starts&#146;. <span class="italic">Following Darkness</span> and <span class="italic">Pirates of the Spring</span>, however, stand easily with his later and most accomplished writing. The second group of novels, in which he found his subject, that of youth and its adult recall, includes <span class="italic">Demophon</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Uncle Stephen</span> (1931), <span class="italic">Brian Westby</span> (1934), <span class="italic">The Retreat</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Peter Waring</span> (1937), and <span class="italic">Young Tom</span> (1944).<br>
<br>Boyhood and adolescence seen through the understanding eyes of an older man supply the subject of most of Reid's work. It is, however, an exaggeration to claim, as some critics have done, that he could not create a believable character over the age of twelve, but there is a definite sense of a &#145;King Charles's head&#146; in much of his fiction&#151;his adult characters are invariably less rounded than his juvenile ones. In book after book humorous, gentle, intelligent boys wander on seashores, in woods, along rivers, in the gardens of houses. There is a whole gallery of them&#151;Peter Waring, Denis Bracknel, Brian Westby, Grif Weston, Beach Traill, and his most successful creation, Tom Barber&#151;who would not take happily to life in an industrial city; who all have a sensitive leaning towards the dumb natural life of a landscape, to the extent at times of an adoration of certain phenomena, such as the moon. Graham Greene's observation that obsession lies at the heart of many modern writers applies particularly well to Reid's output, and a fruitful lead was provided by an anonymous reviewer who suggested that &#145;E. M. Forster's heroes are the sort of men Forrest Reid's boys might have grown into, if Forrest Reid had allowed them to grow up.&#146;<br>
<br>Reid's reputation has perhaps understandably suffered from these apparent obsessions. It is possible to regard him as an &#145;escapist&#146; novelist. This is the view that his abiding concern with childhood, with youth, and with the loss of innocence, often observed in an unreal quasi-paradisal setting, are the trivial concerns of a hence justifiably minor writer. However, the Elysian landscapes which he evokes again and again in his books are essentially the landscape with which he was most familiar&#151;the Ulster landscape. His landscapes are not alternative imaginative topographies but are based upon firm Ulster realities, and he wrote about the links between personality and landscape in a lucid rhythmic prose.<br>
<br>Reid was unmarried. He led a retired and outwardly lonely life but had many varied interests. He was an expert croquet player, a lover of animals and the country, an opera enthusiast, a discriminating collector, a wide reader, and a stimulating and clear-minded conversationalist. He was close with many writers of his own generation, and was generous with help and advice to young authors.<br>
<br>Reid was one of the founder members of the Irish Academy of Letters and received the honorary degree of DLitt at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1933. He was awarded the James Tait Black memorial prize for his last novel, <span class="italic">Young Tom</span>. Reid died at 15 Seaview, Warrenpoint, co. Down, on 4 January 1947 and was buried on 7 January in Dundonald cemetery, Knock, Belfast.<br>
