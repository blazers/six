<span class="headword">Arnot,  Frederick Stanley</span>  (1858&#150;1914), <span class="occ">missionary in Africa</span>, was born on 12 September 1858 at his parents' home, 8 Byrnbank Terrace, Glasgow, the son of William Arnot, a merchant, and Elizabeth Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Macdonald. The family moved to Hamilton in 1864, where Frederick became a playmate of David Livingstone's children. In 1868 the family, led by Arnot's father, left the Free Church of Scotland to join the Plymouth Brethren, a fundamentalist protestant sect without clergy. In Tayport from 1870 and in Glasgow after 1873, to prepare himself to be a missionary to Africa, Arnot learned navigation, shoemaking, tailoring, blacksmithing, and carpentry, as well as acquiring a basic knowledge of medicine, and he preached on tours of England and Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1881 Arnot left for Africa, intending to found missions on the upper Zambezi. He reached Lealui, capital of the Lozi kingdom, where he lived from November 1882 to May 1884. Few converts were made, attendance at his boys' school was fitful, and he failed to convert King Lewanika; and when civil war threatened, Arnot abandoned the venture.<br>
<br>Arnot then travelled to Angola, where he established a chain of mission stations reaching into the interior. In 1886 he extended his travels into the large kingdom ruled over by Msiri in the Katanga area of the Congo, where Msiri accepted him as a British pawn to be played against Arab, Portuguese, and Belgian influences. This allowed Arnot to bring in successor missionaries in December 1887. In the same month he returned to Britain, in failing health, to receive something of a hero's welcome from the press, and honours from the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>During 1889 Arnot met Harriet Jane Fisher (<i>b</i>. 1864/5), of Erfort Lodge, Hyde Vale, Greenwich. They married on 26 March 1889 and went together into Angola, where Arnot was installing new missionaries. Ill health forced his return to Britain in 1892, where he settled in Waterloo, near Liverpool. For the next twenty years he acted as the effective director of the Plymouth Brethren missions in southern Africa, raising money for supplies, deciding on sites, recruiting missionaries, and making frequent visits to Africa, despite his poor health.<br>
<br>In 1908 Arnot moved to Johannesburg, but he spent most of his time in Northern Rhodesia, expanding stations. In 1910 Arnot and his wife opened a new mission station north of Barotseland, but they were forced back to Johannesburg by his bad health. In 1913, once again attempting to open up a new mission in Rhodesia, he suffered a ruptured spleen and was taken by canoe and train back to Johannesburg, where he died after surgery on 15 May 1914.<br>
