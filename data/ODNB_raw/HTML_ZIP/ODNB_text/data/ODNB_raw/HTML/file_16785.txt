<span class="headword">Littleton,  Henry</span>  (1823&#150;1888), <span class="occ">music publisher</span>, was born in London on 7 January (Krummel and Sadie give 2 January) 1823, the son of James and Elizabeth Littleton. About 1837 he began working for the music-sellers and publishers George and Manby of Fleet Street, and was later employed by the music and musical instrument sellers and publishers Monro and May in Holborn. In 1841 he entered the music publishing house of Novello (then at 69 Dean Street, Soho) as a &#145;collector&#146;, when his job was to go round the publishing houses to obtain ordered copies of works not issued by the firm. In 1846 he became manager, in 1861 a partner, and in 1866 sole proprietor. However, J. Alfred Novello had ceased to be personally involved in the day-to-day running of the firm from 1857, when he moved to Italy, and Littleton had effectively been in charge since then. He was evidently a great businessman, and many of the transactions which gained the firm a name for enterprise are attributable to him. The company expanded rapidly, and the development of the English taste for choral music during the period was owing largely to Novello's cheap publications. This was Alfred Novello's idea but it was Littleton who executed it. One of his earliest publications was Novello's <span class="italic">Parish Choir Book</span>, and the first edition of <span class="italic">Hymns Ancient and Modern</span> appeared in 1861. The business of Ewer was acquired in 1867, and the firm subsequently began to publish more secular and orchestral music and entered into concert promotion.<br>
<br>Littleton promoted many well-known composers, including Verdi and Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, as well as publishing editions of works by Purcell. It was partly on his invitation that Liszt visited England in 1886, after an absence of nearly fifty years, when he was Littleton's guest at his home, Westwood House, Sydenham, Kent. When Littleton retired in 1887 the business was the largest of its kind in the world. Both his sons, Alfred Henry (1845&#150;1914) and Augustus James (1854&#150;1942), became chairmen of the company in turn. (His daughter had died in 1885.) He died on 11 May 1888 at Westwood House, and was buried on 16 May at Lee cemetery, Kent. His residence in London was at 1 Berners Street, where the business was located until the end of 1906, and where his sons also resided.<br>
<br>Littleton's portrait reveals a man of heavy build with a long beard and moustache. His &#145;singleness of purpose and integrity of action&#146; is commented on in <span class="italic">A Short History of Cheap Music</span>  (p. 142), and an obituary (written by Joseph Bennett) remarked that<blockquote>under the mask of the man of business&#151;which was all that the general public saw&#151;lay a most affectionate and tender nature &hellip; For proof I need only refer to the kindness he showed to young composers, in several cases going so far as to bear the expense of their education at home and abroad. (<span class="italic">Musical Times</span>, 29, 332)</blockquote>
