<span class="headword">Kirkby,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1705&#150;1754), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and grammarian</span>, claimed to have been born in Cumberland, though in the register of St John's College, Cambridge, from where he appears to have graduated BA in 1726, and proceeded MA in 1745, his birthplace is noted as Londesborough, Yorkshire. Like his father, the Revd Thomas Kirkby, he intended to make a career in the church, but in this, as in his other major ventures in life, he was not very successful. According to his own account, quoted by Edward Gibbon in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, he began life as a poor curate in Cumberland. On 13 June 1725 he married Ann Stable of Egremont; they had several children, of whom only one appears to have outlived her father. In 1739 Kirkby was appointed vicar of Waldershare, Kent, and four years later in 1743 rector of Blackmanstone in Romney Marsh, but a publication of his that same year on behalf of the poorer clergy at Canterbury is believed to have excluded him from further preferment. Kirkby was equally unlucky in his tutorship of Edward Gibbon, who was only seven at the time. Unluckily omitting one morning in November 1745 the name of George II in prayer, he was dismissed by Gibbon's father after only eighteen months of service  (E. Gibbon, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>). While with the Gibbons, Kirkby wrote a grammar of English which, together with a Latin grammar, was published as <span class="italic">A New English Grammar</span> (1746). The grammar partly plagiarized Anne Fisher's <span class="italic">New Grammar</span>, which had been published a year earlier in Newcastle. This makes Fisher, not Kirkby, the ancestor of the rule for the use of sex-indefinite &#145;he&#146;. But unlike Fisher's grammar, Kirkby's was not very popular, for it was never reprinted. Nor does the dedication of the grammar to Gibbon's father appear to have had its desired effect.<br>
<br>Kirkby's plagiarism of Fisher's grammar has gone undetected until very recently; another act of plagiarism was, however, soon discovered. In 1745 he published a novel called <span class="italic">Automathes</span>, a second edition of which appeared in Dublin a year later. Gibbon describes it as a poor performance, and as a plagiarism of well-known romances. It seems largely borrowed from the <span class="italic">History of Autonous</span> (1736). The publication of the grammar and Kirkby's attempt at a novel indicate that he was looking for a career outside the church. Another direction he appears to have considered is that of natural philosophy. In 1748 he published a book called <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Ultimators</span>, of which he presented two copies to the Royal Society in January 1752. In the letter accompanying the gift he suggests that he might like to &#145;establish Weekly Lectures of different Sorts in some Part of London&#146;  (RS archives, L&amp;P 2.251), adding that &#145;it wou d be no small Advantage to these Purposes, to have the Honour of Subscribing my self one of your Society&#146;  (ibid.). Kirkby's gift was duly acknowledged and entered in the minute-books of the society, but the unlucky Kirkby was dismissed in a letter by Thomas Birch with the words &#145;I sincerely wish you Success in all your Studies &amp; Labours for the public&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4312, fol. 455).<br>
<br>Before reaching the age of fifty Kirkby died, a widower, living either in Peter Street, Canterbury, from where he had addressed the Royal Society two years earlier, or in the precinct of Norwich Cathedral, which was his last address according to the grant of probate on 10 December 1754  (TNA: PRO, PROB 6/130, fol. 148<i>r</i>). His &#145;Goods Chattels &amp; Credits&#146;, whatever they may have been, went to his daughter Anne, who was married to a clergyman called John Jeffery the younger.<br>
