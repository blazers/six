<span class="headword">Bald,  Robert</span>  (1776&#150;1861), <span class="occ">mining engineer</span>, was born at Culross, Perthshire, one of two sons of Alexander Bald (<i>d</i>. 1823) and his wife, Jane Christie. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1153/', "Alexander Bald (1783&#150;1859)")</script> was his younger brother. The father was then colliery manager for the earl of Dundonald, and from about 1777 until his death he was employed in a similar capacity by the earl of Mar at his collieries in and around Alloa, Clackmannanshire, one of a number of rapidly growing coal-producing districts in central Scotland.<br>
<br>Bald served an apprenticeship in colliery management under his father, enhancing his surveying and engineering skills under the guidance of Thomas Telford, civil engineer, whom he accompanied to Sweden to assist in surveying the route of the proposed Gotha Canal. He succeeded his father as manager of the Mar collieries in 1824. Sharing responsibility with Robert Jameson, factor for the Mar estate, and initially encouraged by Francis Miller Erskine, twenty-fifth earl of Mar (<i>b</i>. 1795), Bald embarked on an expansionary strategy for the mines he managed. This involved productivity improvements, to be achieved both by the introduction of new technology and also by more efficient labour management. Convinced that the dissipated habits of the colliers were adversely affecting labour productivity, Bald instituted a vigorous programme of social reform, which included the improvement of the colliers' accommodation. Moral reform too was attempted, with the introduction in the main mining communities of prayer meetings, which were run on lines similar to the Scottish kirk sessions, and based on the communal &#145;colliery court&#146; established on the Mar estate in the mid-eighteenth century; among other duties the &#145;brethren&#146; were responsible for chastising those who were drunk or profane. A paternalistic employer with radical inclinations, Bald was also heavily involved in the campaign for parliamentary reform in 1831&#150;2.<br>
<br>Labour disputes and the financial costs of Bald's programme apparently led to a breach between Bald and the trustees of the Mar estate in 1835, even though a year earlier it had been reported that under Bald's management the coal workers at Alloa colliery were &#145;the most orderly and well disposed class of men in Scotland&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 124/11/592/3). Similar problems led to the premature ending of a partnership Bald had joined as a lessee of collieries at Collyland, Woodlands, and Devonside. Freed of some of those ties, Bald then established himself as a full-time consultant mining engineer, based in Edinburgh from 1835, although he had been called as an expert witness during legal actions concerning coal rights as early as 1805.<br>
<br>Bald was Scotland's most respected mining engineer and coal &#145;viewer&#146; in the first half of the nineteenth century, and surveyed and reported on most of the country's major colliery enterprises, including those of the Bairds, the Dixons, and the Dunlops in the west of Scotland. He had an intimate knowledge of the coal industry, based on first-hand experience, and a considerable reputation, which extended to mainland Europe in both coalmining and land surveying. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1817, and was also an honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, as well as of the Geological Society of London.<br>
<br>Less well known is Bald's concern about female coal &#145;bearers&#146;, whose employment underground was a striking feature of the coal industry in the east of Scotland. He first drew attention to their condition in his invaluable <span class="italic">General View of the Coal Trade in Scotland</span> (1808), the most accessible account of the coal industry in Scotland for this period; and he is credited with assisting in the campaign to reform employment abuses in coalmines promoted by Lord Ashley, later seventh earl of Shaftesbury. The employment of women and young children underground at Alloa colliery ceased some time before the legislation of 1842 which abolished the practice. Bald is not known to have married; he died, aged eighty-six, at his home in Alloa, on 28 December 1861.<br>
