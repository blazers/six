<span class="headword">Levison,  Wilhelm</span>  (1876&#150;1947), <span class="occ">historian and philologist</span>, was born on 27 May 1876 in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, the elder son of the two children of Hermann Levison (1839&#150;1886), merchant, and his wife, Josephine Goldschmidt (1845&#150;1916). The Levison family, whose origins in Siegburg are traceable at least to the end of the seventeenth century, was by the mid-nineteenth century an assimilated German Jewish family, and consequently Wilhelm received a general non-Jewish education at the municipal grammar school in D&uuml;sseldorf. In 1894 Levison began his studies at the University of Bonn (spending one semester in Berlin), and in January 1898 he passed his exam and received his doctorate <i>summa cum laude</i>. His thesis, entitled &#145;Die Beurkundung des Civilstandes Altertum&#146;, written under the supervision of Heinrich Nissen (1839&#150;1912), was the first Bonn dissertation in ancient history to be written in German. On 1 January 1899 Levison joined the staff of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH) and worked with Bruno Krusch (1857&#150;1940) on the grand project of the &#145;scriptores rerum Merovingicarum&#146; until 1920. At the same time he also worked as an archivist in Hanover (1899) and Breslau (1900), and in 1903 he was offered a teaching post as <i>Privatdozent</i> at the University of Bonn, where he taught for the next thirty-two years.<br>
<br>In 1909 Levison received the title of professor. In 1917, after the death of his mother, whom he had supported with his modest income, Levison married Elsa Freundlich (1888&#150;1966); they had no children. Levison's academic career went from strength to strength. In 1920 he was installed in a full chair of medieval and modern history at the University of Bonn, and in 1925 he was elected a full member of the MGH's directorate. By 1930 Levison was not only one of Germany's leading medievalists, but also a well known and highly respected scholar throughout the world. In 1931 he was made an honorary DLitt by the University of Durham in recognition of his contributions to Anglo-Saxon studies and the early history of the north of England.<br>
<br>During the early years of the 1930s Levison, the liberal open-minded Jew, watched with great dismay the rise of the right in Germany. Because of his stature and fame he was allowed to keep his position in Bonn during the early years of the Nazi regime, but not for long. Life in Bonn became increasingly difficult, and following the Nuremberg laws of 1935 Levison was forced to leave his position at the university. A further blow came when in 1938 Jews were forbidden to use public libraries. Urged to leave Germany by his younger brother Arthur (1881&#150;1949), who had lived in England since 1899, Levison accepted an offer made to him in 1939 by James Fitzjames Duff, the vice-chancellor of Durham University and warden of the Durham colleges (through the mediation of his old friend, the Anglo-Saxonist Bertram Colgrave) to become an honorary fellow of Durham University. On 16 April 1939 Levison and his wife left Germany and moved to Durham, where he spent the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Levison, who was over sixty by this time, did not stop working on his research. He was invited to be the Ford lecturer in English history at Oxford University; his lectures, delivered in February and March 1943, were later published as <span class="italic">England and the Continent in the Eighth Century</span> (1946). Still a landmark in early medieval studies, the book in more than one respect represents a grateful tribute to the British people, written by one of the greatest scholars who found a refuge in the British Isles. In his preface to the book he thankfully mentions &#145;the kindness and humanity of so many, who, in this [Durham] University and outside it, have striven to persuade us to find a positive answer to the question of Goethe's Iphigenia, whether a foreign country can become to anybody a fatherland&#146;  (p. vii). &#145;May these pages&#146;, he added, &#145;in their small way, contribute to join again broken links, when the works of peace have resumed their place lost in the turmoil of war&#146;  (p. vi).<br>
<br>When the war was over Levison's students and colleagues in Bonn were planning to celebrate his seventieth birthday with the publication of a volume containing some of his most outstanding papers. However, Levison did not survive to see these plans materialize. In the summer of 1946 he suffered a severe heart attack, from which he never fully recovered, and after a second heart attack he died at his home, 4 Victoria Terrace, Durham, on 17 January 1947. He was buried in Durham. He bequeathed all his books (more than 1000 volumes) to Durham University Library, with the proviso that the University of Bonn might claim from them works lost from certain Bonn libraries as the result of the war damage. His personal and other papers were sorted by his widow and divided between the two libraries.<br>
<br>Levison was one of the most important medievalists of his generation, and certainly the most innovative and thought-provoking of them all. In many respects he is the founder of what may be termed the German school of early medieval studies. As an associate of the MGH, first as a <i>Mitarbeiter</i> and later as a member of the governing board, Levison set the tone for the MGH's agenda for many years, and his editions of Merovingian as well as Carolingian texts are still irreplaceable. His many articles and papers, although written more than half a century ago, remain valuable, despite the huge amount of research that has since been undertaken in the field. Levison also trained a generation of early medievalists, and his legacy is admired and followed by many early medievalists in Germany and throughout the world. Those who knew him recalled his magnanimity as his first and most obvious characteristic, aside from his academic achievement. Many of his colleagues and students did not turn their back upon him when things became difficult in the early 1930s; between 1930 and 1933 Levison supervised no less than seven dissertations. Years later he recalled &#145;with grateful mind&#146; the old pre-war colleagues and students from his <i>alma mater Bonnensis</i> and the MGH, &#145;many of whom did not bow the knee to Baal, but remained faithful till the hour of parting could no longer be avoided&#146;  (<span class="italic">England and the Continent</span>, vii).<br>
