<span class="headword">Wren,  Christopher</span>  (1589&#150;1658), <span class="occ">dean of Windsor</span>, was born in the city of London on 17 September 1589, the third child and second son of Francis Wren (1553&#150;1624), who was described in <span class="italic">Parentalia</span> as a London mercer but on his marriage certificate as a &#145;painter&#150;stainer&#146;; Christopher's mother was Susan, daughter of John Wiggington, a &#145;merchant of London and deputy alderman of Cheapside&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parentalia</span>, BL Add. MS 25071, fol. 4). Like his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30021/', "Matthew Wren (1585&#150;1667)")</script>, later bishop of Ely, Christopher was admitted as a scholar at Merchant Taylors' School (9 February 1601) but unlike him he went to Oxford. He was elected a Sir Thomas White scholar at St John's College in 1605 and matriculated in October 1608; he graduated BA in June 1609 and proceeded MA in 1613, when he was a candidate for the chair of astronomy at Gresham College, London. As a graduate he wrote a successful Latin drama, <span class="italic">Physiponomachia</span>, based on a passage from Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>, which he dedicated to his college's president, John Buckeridge. In April 1619 he and Brian Duppa of All Souls were appointed to serve as proctors. On 21 June 1620 he defended his BD and a week later he was granted a licence to preach. In the same year he became a household chaplain to Bishop Lancelot Andrewes, a close friend of Buckeridge and formerly master of Matthew Wren's Cambridge college. Andrewes himself was also an old boy of Merchant Taylors' School and in 1620 he appointed the younger Wren to be rector of Fonthill Bishop in Wiltshire. There Christopher married, in September 1623, Mary Cox (<i>bap</i>. 1604, <i>d</i>. after 1660?), the daughter of Robert Cox. Recent research has shown that Cox, who died in early 1647, was not (as previously thought) a London merchant who had acquired land at Fonthill Bishop prior to his death in November 1621, but a modest, non-gentry landowner of that parish  (Davies and Johnson)`. Christopher Wren remained rector until 1639 and in 1623 he became rector also of the neighbouring parish of East Knoyle. It was there that he and his family lived&#151;Wren's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30019/', "Christopher Wren (1632&#150;1723)")</script>, the future architect, was born in the village. The younger Christopher was one of eleven children born to the couple between 1624 and 1643.<br>
<br>In 1628, while Wren was appointed a chaplain to the king, his brother Matthew, already master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, became dean of Wolverhampton and of Windsor and register of the Order of the Garter. When Matthew resigned his offices on becoming bishop of Hereford in 1634, Christopher was not elected despite having been the front runner, but did succeed to all his other positions, being admitted to the deanery at Windsor on 4 April 1635. Later in life Wren took great pleasure in pointing out that his family had been associated with Windsor since before the Reformation since one Geoffrey Wren had held the seventh stall there under Henry VII. Like his brother before him Dean Wren was assiduous in attending to chapter business, even transferring two chapter meetings, in October 1636 and in 1638, to the deanery when recurrent ill health prevented him leaving his home. He followed his brother's 1628 initiative in insisting upon order and decency in the life of the chapel, complaining to the king in 1637 of &#145;promiscuous and undecent sitting in, and filling the stalles in the Choyre by weomen and people of meane qualitie&#146;  (Windsor Castle, chapter acts, VI. B 2, fol. 138<i>r</i>), against which the king provided for reordering the chapel.<br>
<br>As dean Wren had oversight of the worship for the Garter knights whenever they were at Windsor, and as register of the Garter, an office traditionally linked with the deanery, he took a serious interest in the history of the order and in record keeping. He delighted Charles I by establishing that Henry VII had been entitled &#145;defender of the faith&#146;, &#145;long before the Pope's pretended Donation&#146; of 1521  (Wren, <span class="italic">Parentalia</span>, 143).<br>
<br>The marginalia of Wren's books&#151;including that of Henry Wootton's <span class="italic">Elements of Architecture</span>&#151;reveal him to have been interested in the visual arts and a talented draughtsman. At East Knoyle Wren used the profits from his deanery to undertake the redecoration of the chancel. In 1639 he employed a Dorset man, Robert Brockway, to undertake the work that he designed and supervised himself. The plasterwork covers the four walls and extends above head height with friezes of strapwork patterns depicting cherubs on the north and south walls; in Wren's original design the ceiling was also decorated with plaster cherubim, though these were removed in the nineteenth century. The east wall, and the flanking panels of the north and south walls, bear images and texts on the theme of Jacob's dream, while opposite, on the chancel's west wall, is the ascension and next to this, on the north wall, is a depiction of an &#145;everyman&#146; figure kneeling as a supplicant, lamenting with the psalmist that he is yet far off and wingless, unable to reach the highest heavens <span class="roman">(Psalm 55)</span>.<br>
<br>In November 1638 Wren was presented to the living of Great Haseley in Oxfordshire by the unanimous vote of the Windsor chapter, but he had little enjoyment in the living, and by Easter 1641 sought to exchange it with Christopher Potter, the dean of Worcester. At the outbreak of the civil war he took care to safeguard the registers of the Order of the Garter, hiding them with the order's silver, beneath the floor of the treasury. This precaution paid off when the castle was first ransacked in 1642 but three years later a more determined search found them. Although Wren successfully petitioned for the return of the documents of the order, the 1637 altar silver, made by Christian van Vianen, and other treasures were never returned. The deanery itself was sacked on 21 September 1642, allegedly by parliamentary order, although both houses denied this, and as well as personal papers Wren's collection of gift silver, from the king, the elector palatine, and other knights of the Garter, was taken. At the time all that was returned to him was his harpsichord, valued at 10<i>s</i>.<br>
<br>Wren was expelled from Windsor by parliamentary forces in May 1643 and spent the next two years at the royalist centres of East Knoyle, Oxford, and Bristol. He was described as a &#145;main agent&#146; in the organizing of the Clubmen to resist parliamentary forces on the Wiltshire&#150;Dorset border in summer 1645. However, by then, and despite a royal order for his protection (December 1643), Wren had been briefly imprisoned following a referral by the sequestration committee. In this or the following year Wren wrote to one of his churchwardens suggesting that &#145;there were certaine pictures in the chancel of Knowle wch might prove scandalous&#146; for their potential association with Laudian forms of worship  (BL, Add. MS 22084, fol. 25). After his release from custody (for which he paid &pound;40 in August) he was rearrested and imprisoned for five months at Bristol and Longford Castle, Wiltshire, before his release by July 1646. As a consequence of his being declared &#145;a delinquent&#146; he was deprived of his living at East Knoyle, though he retained a small property in the village. His creative decoration at East Knoyle church was censured before the Faulstone commission meeting at Longford Castle in May 1647. In retirement he moved to Bletchingdon in Oxfordshire, where his son-in-law William Holder was incumbent, and renewed his considerable scholarly interests&#151;encouraging his son's remarkable talents in mathematics and writing extensive comments on Francis Bacon's <span class="italic">Sylva sylvarum</span> and <span class="italic">New Atlantis</span> and on Thomas Browne's <span class="italic">Pseudodoxia epidemica</span>. Wren's marginalia reveal his diverse interests and wide reading in, among other subjects, botany, climatology, and child-rearing. Christopher Wren died at the vicarage at Bletchingdon on 29 May 1658 and was buried in the churchyard. He was survived by his wife.<br>
