<span class="headword">Phillips,  Walter Alison</span>  (1864&#150;1950), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at Lewisham, London, on 21 October 1864, the youngest son of John Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1871), a commission merchant, and his wife, Jane, daughter of John Atkins, solicitor. He received his elementary education in Germany at Weimar, where the family had moved after his father's death. The musician Walther Wolfgang von Goethe, the poet's grandson, was his godfather; indeed until 1875 the family occupied rooms in the <i>Goethehaus</i> in the centre of the town. In that year Phillips was sent to a preparatory school at Margate. In June 1877 he went on to Merchant Taylors' School, London, from where he went to Merton College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in 1882. Having graduated with first class honours in modern history in 1885, he was elected a senior scholar of St John's College, Oxford, in 1886. In the following year he was president of the Oxford Union.<br>
<br>Despite his early academic distinction Phillips did not immediately enter academia. An accomplished musician of artistic temperament, he was attracted by the idea of a career as a professional singer. He returned in 1888 to Weimar, where he remained until 1891, pursuing musical and artistic studies. The liberal cosmopolitanism of Weimar society had a lasting influence on him, as indeed had German culture. His first publication in 1896 was a selection of poems by Walther von der Vogelweide which he translated from the medieval Middle High German. On his return to England he sang professionally for the next five years; but with a great career on the concert platform seemingly beyond his vocal powers he abandoned music for scholarship, lecturing for the university extension movement. He married in 1905 Catherine Beatrice, daughter of George Frederick Sennett, an accountant's clerk, of Dale in Pembrokeshire. Like Phillips an accomplished linguist, she translated several historical works; they had no children.<br>
<br>It was during this period that Phillips developed his interest in modern European diplomatic history. Indeed he first attracted attention as a historian with <span class="italic">The War of Greek Independence</span>, which he published in 1897. This small monograph and his work for the university extension movement led to an invitation by Rivingtons to contribute to their series on European history. His <span class="italic">Modern Europe, 1815&#150;1899</span>, published in 1901 and reprinted several times, soon established itself as a standard textbook in the universities and higher forms of the public schools. In 1903 he became chief assistant editor of the eleventh edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, for which he wrote some 94 articles, mostly on European history and aspects of diplomatic practice. His three contributions in volume 10 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span> (1907) also dealt with aspects of diplomatic history, most notably his chapter on the congresses after 1815. His contribution to volume 2 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy</span> (1923) was on the same subject. Indeed much of his best work can be found in composite histories and encyclopaedias. The immediate post-Napoleonic period had particularly captivated him. His writings on it were based on the meticulous and extensive study of original documents; they are characterized by his lucid power of exposition and a certain vehemence in the expression of his views.<br>
<br>This also applies to perhaps the most important work by Phillips, <span class="italic">The Confederation of Europe: a Study of the European Alliance, 1813&#150;1823</span>, which was published in 1914. The book originated from a series of six lectures which he was invited to deliver in the University Schools, Oxford, by the delegates of the Common University Fund in the Trinity term 1913. Although the subject required and was given historical treatment, the object and scope of the book were not purely historical. The principal purpose of the <span class="italic">Confederation</span> was to illustrate the problems involved in the practical application of the principles of international law. A tour of the United States in 1911 had impressed upon him the dangers of what he regarded as &#145;the shallow and uninformed idealism of the pacifist movement&#146;  (&#145;Preface to the second edition&#146;, vi). In the second and much enlarged edition, published in 1920, he applied those warnings to the idealism that fired the League of Nations movement.<br>
<br>During the three years before the outbreak of the First World War Phillips occupied himself intensely with the study of past and present international politics. In 1912 he was invited to join the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, to which he had previously contributed leading articles and reviews on an occasional basis. In the same year, until 1913, he travelled as the paper's special correspondent through South America; he also acted as editor of the <span class="italic">Times South American Supplement</span> and as adviser on South American affairs.<br>
<br>In 1914, soon after the publication of <span class="italic">The Confederation of Europe</span>, Phillips was appointed to the newly endowed Lecky chair of modern history at Trinity College, Dublin. His previous scholarly work and his long tenure of the Lecky professorship&#151;he held it until his retirement in 1939&#151;lent distinction to the chair and the university, though, as his contemporaries noted, he remained somewhat &#145;aloof &hellip; giving the impression of not really belonging to either Ireland or to Trinity College, but rather to Oxford or London&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 Oct 1950, 6); and indeed, when not actually in residence at Trinity, he spent much of his time in London.<br>
<br>Throughout the First World War Phillips published on the political issues involved in the conflict. His contributions principally to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh</span> and <span class="italic">Quarterly</span> reviews and <span class="italic">New Europe</span> are characterized by a blend of enlightened pragmatism and a resigned scepticism as to the efficacy of all grand peace designs. This pessimism earned him the unmerited epithet of &#145;the English Bernhardi&#146;, an apostle of the gospel of war, on pacifist platforms  (<span class="italic">The Confederation of Europe</span>, 1920, &#145;Preface to the second edition&#146;, vii).<br>
<br>After the war Phillips turned his attention to other subjects. He was profoundly out of sympathy with the &#145;Irish quarrel&#146;, which had outlasted the cataclysm of the war. His pronounced, though meticulously researched and carefully documented, views on Irish affairs found expression in <span class="italic">The Revolution in Ireland, 1906&#150;1923</span> (1923), which was based on official documents as well as ephemeral nationalist pamphlets. In the following years he published three smaller general surveys of early modern European history from the Reformation to the Thirty Years' War. In 1933 he undertook his last major piece of scholarly work. At the request of the Irish ecclesiastical authorities and under his editorship the three stout volumes of <span class="italic">The History of the Church in Ireland</span> were published in 1933&#150;4. The idea of clerical life had attracted him on leaving Oxford, and ecclesiastical history and rituals continued to fascinate him&#151;a fascination to which his learned though abstruse articles in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> on aspects of church hierarchy and liturgy testify. In 1936, in a joint effort with Arthur Reede, he returned for a last time to the field of diplomatic history with a study of neutral commerce and belligerent rights during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.<br>
<br>Walter Alison Phillips was a LittD of Dublin and a member of the Royal Irish Academy, and was elected an honorary fellow of his old college, Merton, in 1938. He died at his home, 24 Bellevue Road, Barnes, Surrey, on 28 October 1950; he was survived by his wife.<br>
