<span class="headword">Jempson,  (Arthur) John</span>  (1904&#150;1981), <span class="occ">road haulier</span>, was born at Strand Quay, Rye, Sussex, on 14 September 1904, the eldest son in a family of two sons and four daughters of Arthur Jempson (1877&#150;1955) and his wife, Ruth Palmer (1876&#150;1956), daughter of a seed merchant. The parents were Strict Baptists. Arthur Jempson had acquired a small haulage business from an uncle in the late nineteenth century, and the family home was next to rented stables where the firm's few horses and vehicles were kept. John Jempson went to local schools but left aged thirteen to join his father at a time of acute wartime labour shortage. As a schoolboy he was accustomed to delivering and collecting goods in his spare time, so he soon mastered the details of what was essentially a local business.<br>
<br>Young Jempson's interests were in motors, however, and he soon owned his own motorcycle, which he used for both work and pleasure. In 1924, aged twenty, he persuaded his reluctant father to lend him &pound;145 to buy a Ford Model T, which he ran himself as part of the business, sharing the proceeds with his father. Capable of carrying 30 cwt, though supposed to carry no more than 20, and faster than horse-drawn vehicles, this small motor lorry had greater earning capacity, but involved much more work for its owner&#150;driver, as he shovelled stone, or loaded sacks, which then weighed up to 2.25 cwt each. Living simply with his parents, he soon built up a business, and was able to repay his father's loan within six months. In March 1926 he paid &pound;800 for a 6 ton Thornycroft; other motor lorries soon followed. John Jempson made the transition to employer, though he continued to drive one of the larger lorries (with a mate) until 1934, with one of his sisters taking orders, and holding the office together, which she continued to do until her death. By 1934 seasonal traffic in fruit and hops, and all-year traffic in building materials, had been developed over the longer distance to London, providing door-to-door service at railway rates. Return freight, if available, was brought back the same day from the London docks. By 1937 turnover neared &pound;14,000, and father and son could pay themselves not only their &pound;6 per week wages but also &pound;608 each out of the year's profit of &pound;2776. John Jempson had become a man of substance in control of a flourishing business. On 9 June 1938, aged thirty-three, he married Adah Ruth Ashby, the daughter of a prosperous Romney Marsh farmer. They had a son and a daughter and lived at Romney Marsh until 1943, when they moved to Rye.<br>
<br>Nationalization of road haulage proved advantageous for John Jempson. He agreed to manage the Rye depot of British Road Services, of which his former business was the nucleus, and was later promoted traffic superintendent at Tenterden, where he got to know new customers. On denationalization he put in a successful bid for the Rye depot, buying back a much larger business for considerably less than he had extracted in compensation earlier. This must have given him much satisfaction as a lifelong Conservative. Rapid economic&#151;and therefore traffic&#151;growth followed during the 1950s. The firm's profits allowed vehicles to be replaced by larger, faster, and more efficient models. By 1960, with this transformed fleet of only twenty-five lorries, revenue had grown by nearly 50 per cent, and costs by only 20 per cent. The firm was turned into a limited company, but was still wholly owned by Jempson and his wife. Economic conditions in the following years were less propitious, but by 1965 Jempson, then sixty-one, felt able to hand over day-to-day running to his 22-year-old son.<br>
<br>Like his father, Jonathan Jempson had driven lorries in his holidays, but his father's success had bestowed benefits John himself had never had; Tonbridge School, followed by a degree in commerce at Edinburgh. Jonathan's outlook was rather different from that of his cautious father. He also believed in borrowing money to make more of opportunities and accelerate growth, and this new policy was very successful. By the early 1980s the company was running sixty up-to-date vehicles.<br>
<br>John Jempson died at St Helen's Hospital, Ore, Hastings, Sussex, on 21 October 1981, survived by his wife. He was buried in Rye cemetery on 26 October. He had built up a business by careful and unceasing effort from small beginnings over forty long years; he handed it on to a son who was prepared to build on his success.<br>
