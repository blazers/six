<span class="headword">Fay <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Clement]</span>,  Eliza</span>  (1755/6&#150;1816), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, was one of the three identified daughters of Edward Clement (<i>d</i>. 1794), shipwright, of Rotherhithe, Surrey; further details of her birth, upbringing, and education are unknown aside from her statement that her mother died between 1780 and 1783.<br>
<br>In April 1779, aged twenty-three, Eliza Fay embarked on the first of what she later stated were her five journeys to India. She accompanied her husband, Anthony Fay, a barrister and the only son of Francis Fay, gentleman, of Rotherhithe, who intended to practise at the Calcutta supreme court. The couple had married on 6 February 1772 at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, London. Fay, who was born in Ireland, had been admitted to Gray's Inn on 10 November 1772 and Lincoln's Inn on 4 July 1778; in the same year Edward Clement stood surety for Fay at Clement's Inn. In her account of her travels&#151;published posthumously in 1817 as <span class="italic">Original Letters from India</span>&#151;Eliza Fay explained that she undertook the journey &#145;with a view to preserving my husband from destruction&#146;, in view of his &#145;violence of temper&#146;, extravagance, and &#145;dissipated habits&#146;  (Fay, 1986, 175). She also provided a number of clues about her earlier life: on her arrival in Calais in 1779, for example, she noted that this was her fourth visit to the town and that she had also visited Paris on a previous occasion. Her studied interest in clothing and fabrics prompted E. M. Forster to wonder whether Fay may have had a commercial education, possibly dressmaking in France.<br>
<br>The couple followed an arduous overland route to India and arrived in Calicut in November 1779 in the build-up to the Second Anglo-Mysore War. The Fays, with eight other Europeans, were taken captive by a Captain Ayres, acting under Sardar Khan, governor of Calicut. They were imprisoned for three and a half months before their release was secured by a Mr Isaac, a respected Jewish merchant of Cochin.<br>
<br>On 16 June 1780 Anthony Fay was admitted as an advocate at the supreme court of Calcutta. The couple began to move in &eacute;lite social circles, with Eliza enjoying the patronage of the judge Sir Robert Chambers and his wife, Frances. But neither Anthony Fay's career nor his marriage prospered. Just over a year later he fathered an illegitimate child, and Eliza Fay demanded a private deed of separation (signed on 11 August 1781). Soon after, at the instigation of Colonel Henry Watson, Anthony Fay returned to Britain to present a petition to parliament against Sir Elijah Impey, chief justice of the Calcutta supreme court. Thereafter nothing more is known of Anthony Fay's life aside from references in two law reports, early in 1794, in which his name (given in one instance as Alexander Fay) was cited in a legal case.<br>
<br>Lacking any means of support, Eliza Fay left for Britain in 1782. She returned to Calcutta two years later to set up as a milliner, her co-partner being a former travelling companion, Avis Hicks. During this period she turned down two offers to &#145;engage in a seminary for young ladies&#146;, about which she expressed regret  (Fay, 1986, 215, 238). In 1786 Hicks&#151;who had married a Calcutta shopkeeper, John Lacey&#151;sought to return to England on health grounds after the death of her infant child. She was accompanied by Anthony Fay's son; however, Avis and the child were drowned when their ship was grounded near Calcutta in September 1786. Eliza Fay's millinery business failed in 1788, but the trustees allowed her to continue to trade, and she managed to satisfy her creditors over the next five years. In May 1791 Fay wrote of a young man, Benjamin Lacey, described in the letters as the &#145;brother of my lamented friend's husband&#146;, whom she &#145;received &hellip; into my family&#146; and left to supervise her business interests in Calcutta  (ibid., 240).<br>
<br>In 1794 Fay returned once more to Britain, breaking her voyage at St Helena, where she was summoned by the governor to answer a case brought against her by Kate Johnson, who had formerly been in her service. Johnson stated that she had accompanied Fay on her previous voyage from Calcutta in 1782, only to have been left without her consent at St Helena and subsequently sold into slavery. The reason for her abandonment, Johnson alleged, was that she had known that Fay &#145;was intimate with the Doctor of the Ship&#146;. Fay maintained that she left Johnson &#145;on account of her bad behaviour&#146; and &#145;did not suppose she would have been sold&#146;  (BL OIOC, factory records, St Helena, G/32/57, fols. 1<i>v</i>&#150;2<i>r</i>). Rather than stand trial, Fay paid a &pound;60 fine. To set this incident in context, it should be noted that any report of sexual activity on the part of a separated wife might jeopardize her maintenance allowance.<br>
<br>Following her father's death in 1794 Fay and her sole surviving sister, Eleanor Preston, wife of Thomas Wilkinson Preston of Rotherhithe, inherited leasehold property at Cheriton and Landim&ocirc;r, Glamorgan, while Eleanor also received freehold rental property at Rotherhithe. In the same year Fay began a new career as a merchant, travelling between Britain, India, and the United States. Her ventures were dogged by disaster: one ship caught fire, another was deemed unseaworthy. Ruined goods, poor markets, and unexpected bills further damaged her business. A series of announcements in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> reveals that, from 1798, John and Benjamin Lacey also faced bankruptcy proceedings. On 6 May 1800 &#145;Mrs Elizabeth Fay, of Fenchurch-street, London, Widow&#146;, together with Benjamin Lacey, &#145;Merchants, Dealers, Chapmen and Copartners&#146;, had a commission of bankruptcy awarded against them. Subsequent entries show how Fay sought to restore some of her household goods, as well as the lease on her house in Fenchurch Street. Only in October 1812 do proceedings appear to have been concluded with the payment of a further dividend.<br>
<br>In August 1804 Fay left once more for Calcutta, arriving in January of the following year. Later in 1805 she announced her intention to open a school at Blackheath, Surrey, and in December returned to England accompanied by fourteen children. Soon after her arrival she took over Ashburnham House, Blackheath, and there opened a girls' boarding school, charging 40 guineas per annum, for which the terms were published in the <span class="italic">Prince of Wales Island Gazette</span> (9 Dec 1809). Fay's school, which she ran in association with Marian Cousins, was still receiving pupils when she signed her will on 30 March 1813. However, in the following year Fay and Cousins announced that the partnership had been dissolved  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 22 July 1814), though the school continued to be run by other proprietors.<br>
<br>At the end of 1814 Eliza Fay obtained a &pound;200 bond with the East India Company to travel (as a passenger) to Bengal, and she left in the spring of 1815 on the <i>Sir Stephen Lushington</i>. At Calcutta she prepared for publication her <span class="italic">Original Letters from India</span>. Lively, shrewd, and opinionated, she recounts her travels, marital trials, and commercial ventures. The book's frontispiece&#151;taken from an engraving of a portrait by Arthur William Devis&#151;depicts her in Egyptian dress and presents a striking, orientalized figure, but her attention in the text is focused mainly on the workings of British society in Calcutta. A contemporary reviewer praised her spirited style and acute observation  (<span class="italic">Calcutta Gazette</span>, 1818), while later critics concentrated on her status as a female traveller: W. K. Firminger in his 1908 edition of <span class="italic">Original Letters</span> suggested that Fay's audacity and unfeminine behaviour might alienate readers' sympathies, E. M. Forster described her as courageous and gallant in his 1925 edition, and Felicity A. Nussbaum, writing in 1995, championed her emergent feminist consciousness.<br>
<br>Eliza Fay died insolvent in Calcutta on 9 September 1816. The registers of St John's Church, Calcutta, record her burial on 10 September 1816. Her estate was administered by the registrar of the supreme court and her possessions auctioned off to meet her debts. Her will was proved on 12 June 1818, the sole beneficiary being her widowed sister Eleanor, then resident in Blackheath.<br>
