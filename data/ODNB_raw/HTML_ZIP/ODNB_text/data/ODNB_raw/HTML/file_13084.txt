<span class="headword">Hermann</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1078), <span class="occ">bishop of Ramsbury and of Sherborne</span>, came from the continent to England early in the reign of Edward the Confessor. His parentage, date of birth, and precise place of origin are all unknown. According to the chronicle of John of Worcester, he came from Lotharingia, although William of Malmesbury in his <span class="italic">Gesta pontificum</span> says that he was Flemish by birth. However, Philip Grierson has argued that the name Hermann, common in Lotharingia, is rare in Flanders, and that William may have been misled by the fact that Hermann spent part of his career at the abbey of St Bertin. He became one of Edward the Confessor's chaplains by 1044, and in 1045 Edward appointed him to succeed the deceased Brihtwold as bishop of Ramsbury or Wilton, a diocese corresponding in extent to Wiltshire and Berkshire and with its see based at Ramsbury (a small settlement of no economic or political significance and with a cathedral community which can only have been tiny). In 1050 Hermann, together with Bishop Ealdred of Worcester, was sent to Rome by Edward the Confessor to negotiate with the pope. Edward made the decision to send the two bishops at the mid-Lent council of London in 1050 and the pair arrived in Rome on 14 April. The subject of the negotiations is unclear; claims in twelfth-century Westminster forgeries that Edward was trying to release himself from a vow to go on pilgrimage are unlikely to be valid. None the less it is obvious that Hermann was highly thought of by Edward.<br>
<br>Hermann himself, however, was frustrated by the limited resources of his diocese, and in 1055 requested that Edward should allow him to take over Malmesbury Abbey as his see church. In this he may have been influenced by Bishop Leofric of Crediton's decision to move his see to Exeter, a move permitted by Edward, whose charter allowing this had been witnessed by Hermann, among others. However, the monks of Malmesbury put up a much tougher fight than the clerks of Exeter had done; Edward refused Hermann's request and the latter decided to leave England for Flanders and to become a monk at the abbey of St Bertin. Meanwhile, Bishop Ealdred of Worcester took over responsibility for Ramsbury. In 1058 Ealdred wished to leave England to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and Hermann was persuaded to return to his diocese. On the death of Bishop &AElig;lfwold of Sherborne, who last occurs in a charter of 1059, Hermann was appointed to succeed him and the two sees of Sherborne and Ramsbury were united. He encouraged a young monk of St Bertin, Goscelin, to travel to England and join his episcopal household. Although Goscelin eventually found a more permanent home at St Augustine's, Canterbury, he maintained ties with the diocese of Sherborne until shortly after Hermann's death, when he completed a life of St Wulfsige (Bishop Wulfsige of Sherborne) which Hermann had commissioned, and, shortly afterwards, a life of St Edith of Wilton. Hermann himself had close contacts with Wilton, whose new abbey church he dedicated in 1065 at the request of Queen Edith, who had paid for the rebuilding.<br>
<br>After the Norman conquest Hermann continued to be held in esteem. He probably attended the Council of Windsor in April 1070, since its decrees were soon afterwards copied into a Romano-Germanic pontifical of French origin used at Sherborne in his day, and on 29 August 1070 he assisted at Lanfranc's consecration. In the following year, however, Lanfranc expressed unease about Hermann's health in a letter to Pope Alexander II in which he stated that Hermann might wish to be released from his diocesan duties to become a monk once more. Lanfranc tried, not quite successfully, to dismiss a rumour that Hermann was weighed down by injuries done to him and by services owed to the king. Lanfranc did not specify Hermann's problems, though they may possibly be the demands placed on him by the king's judges which Goscelin refers to in a miracle story at the end of his life of St Wulfsige: apparently Hermann defended his rights with the aid of Wulfsige's relics. At all events, Hermann decided to persevere as bishop. He attended the Council of Windsor at Whitsun 1072 and in 1075 at the Council of London he won permission to move his see to a more important site: the borough of Old Sarum, now being refortified by William I with a castle. However, little progress could be made in building a cathedral there in the few years that remained to Hermann, who died on 20 February 1078. His place of burial is unknown; a tradition that he was buried at Old Sarum and then moved to Salisbury is almost certainly false, and it is possible that his resting place was Sherborne.<br>
