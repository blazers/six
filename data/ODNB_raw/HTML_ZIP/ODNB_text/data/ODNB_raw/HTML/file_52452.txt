<span class="headword">Daniel,  Walter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1150&#150;1167), <span class="occ">Cistercian monk, hagiographer, and theologian</span>, was a monk of the abbey of Rievaulx from 1150 to his death, and the author of a number of theological, philosophical, and biographical works. The best known of these is his life of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8916/', "Ailred of Rievaulx")</script>. Ailred died in 1167; Walter had lived under his direction for seventeen years; and when he entered Rievaulx in 1150, his father, Daniel, was already a monk of the house, having taken the habit at least three years earlier. It is possible that the family was of knightly origin, but whether, as has been suggested, they were the Daniels of the Balliol fief in Cleveland, Yorkshire, can be regarded as no more than conjecture. Before entering Rievaulx, Walter had been educated in the schools&#151;where is unknown&#151;and it would appear that he had also received professional medical training. He refers to himself as <i>medicus</i>, he betrays a specialized knowledge of disease, and he was Ailred's constant attendant during the latter's chronic illnesses. It is therefore possible that he was infirmarian of Rievaulx, though that is not certain.<br>
<br>Apart from being Ailred's <i>medicus</i>, Walter was also his amanuensis and one of his closest companions. He himself seems to have been an intelligent, learned, and devout monk, quick to understand and effective in argument, though perhaps somewhat irritable and too easily offended. But whatever his faults, he was a prolific writer and John Leland (<i>d</i>. 1552), who visited Rievaulx shortly before the dissolution, saw in the library nine of his works: <span class="italic">Centum sententiae</span>; <span class="italic">Centum homiliae</span>; <span class="italic">Epistolae, justum volumen</span>; <span class="italic">De virginitate Mariae</span>; <span class="italic">Expositio super &#145;Missus est angelus Gabriel&#146;</span>; <span class="italic">De honesta virginis formula</span>; <span class="italic">De onere jumentorum austri, libri ii</span>; <span class="italic">De vera amicitia, libri v</span>; and <span class="italic">De conceptione beatae Mariae contra Nicholaum monachum, libri ii</span>. Leland does not mention the life of Ailred, and apart from that work only the <span class="italic">Centum sententiae</span> and four sermons survive. The life of Ailred is prefaced by a defence of the work and of Ailred's own reputation, known as the <span class="italic">Epistola ad Mauricium</span>: the Maurice in question was probably Maurice of Kirkham. Of the other works nothing is known save their titles and incipits. The <span class="italic">Expositio super &#145;Missus est angelus Gabriel&#146;</span> echoes the four sermons on the same verse (<span class="roman">Luke</span> 1: 26) by Bernard of Clairvaux; the <span class="italic">De onere jumentorum austri</span> (<span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 30: 6) was clearly indebted to Ailred's sermons on the burdens of Isaiah; the <span class="italic">De vera amicitia</span> perhaps continued Ailred's dialogue <span class="italic">De spirituali amicitia</span>, in which Walter was proud to have been one of the participants; and the Nicholas against whom Walter wrote his <span class="italic">De conceptione beatae Mariae</span> was Nicholas of St Albans, whose treatise in defence of the doctrine of the immaculate conception against Bernard of Clairvaux still survives. Judging from the <span class="italic">Centum sententiae</span>, Walter's works might have been learned and thorough rather than inspired and original, though Leland thought them worthy of publication.<br>
<br>According to John Bale (<i>d</i>. 1563), Walter died and was buried at Rievaulx&#151;there is no reason to doubt the tradition&#151;but the date of his death, as that of his birth, remains unknown.<br>
