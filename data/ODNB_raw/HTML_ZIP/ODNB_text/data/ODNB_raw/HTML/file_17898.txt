<span class="headword">Malone,  William</span>  (1586&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Jesuit and religious controversialist</span>, was born in Dublin on 6 December 1586, the son of Simon Malone, merchant, and his wife, Margaret Bexwick of Manchester. He studied at Douai before entering the Society of Jesus at Rome on 24 September 1606. At Antwerp in 1611 he published the first English translation of the autobiography of St Teresa of Avila. He continued his studies at Rome and in Portugal, at Evora (1611&#150;14) and Coimbra (1614&#150;15). He was ordained in Portugal in 1615 before returning to Ireland as part of the Irish Jesuit mission.<br>
<br>Malone is remembered principally for his part in a theological disputation with James Ussher, later archbishop of Armagh, and other protestant controversialists. In 1621 he circulated, possibly in manuscript, a &#145;Challenge about the judgement of antiquity concerning the Romish religion&#146;, a short polemical work questioning the idea that the Church of Rome had deviated from the pure doctrines of Christianity, and challenging what he perceived as protestant disregard for many of the teachings of the fathers of the church on matters like the real presence, confession, and tradition. Ussher replied in manuscript and subsequently in print in <span class="italic">An Answer to a Jesuit</span> (Dublin, 1624). Three years later Malone's reply to Ussher was printed at Douai under the title <span class="italic">A reply to Mr James Ussher his answere, wherein &hellip; the uniform consent of antiquity is declared to stande for the Roman religion: and the answerer is convinced of vanity in challenging the patronage of the doctors of the primitive church for his protestancy</span>. His reply did not go into circulation in Dublin until 1629 or 1630. George Synge and Roger Puttocke prepared separate rejoinders which were printed in 1632. Christopher Sibthorpe also replied to Malone but his contribution circulated in manuscript only. Joshua Hoyle's rejoinder, the last published text in the Malone controversy, was published in Dublin in 1641.<br>
<br>Malone's published work was not universally well received by Irish Catholic clergy on the continent with reservations expressed about Malone's dedication to Charles I, which to many appeared to award undue influence to the king in the resolution of religious controversy. However, his Catholic critics considered that the least damage would be done if his writings were ignored.<br>
<br>Malone served for a time as superior of the Jesuits in Dublin until in 1635 he became rector of the secular Irish College at Rome, a position he retained until 1647. The college had been founded by Cardinal Ludovisi with the assistance of John Roche, later bishop of Ferns, and the Franciscan Luke Wadding, and following the premature death of the founder in 1632 the Ludovisian college had passed from Franciscan to Jesuit control in controversial circumstances.<br>
<br>In December 1647 Malone was appointed superior of the Jesuit mission in Ireland. Differences with the papal nuncio, Cardinal Rinuccini, in 1648 soon gave rise to requests for his recall. He ceased to be superior in 1650, but was again temporarily in charge in 1653 before being deported from Ireland by the parliamentarians in 1654. In the following year he became rector of the Jesuit college at Seville in Spain; he died in Seville on 18 August 1656.<br>
