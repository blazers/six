<span class="headword">Woods, Sir  John Harold Edmund</span>  (1895&#150;1962), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Kensington, London, on 20 April 1895, the elder son of John Henry Woods (1866&#150;1944) and his wife, Annie Alker, both of whom came from Wigan. His father was a cherubic, scholarly man who had been a wrangler at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and a mathematical coach before seeking ordination (1905) and was subsequently vicar of St Mark's, South Shields, and rector of Glaston, Uppingham.<br>
<br>Woods was educated at Christ's Hospital, Horsham, Sussex, and after the First World War at Balliol College, Oxford. He won classical and other school prizes, was captain of rugger, cricket, and fives, and was reappointed captain of the school for a second year. In 1914 he won an exhibition to Balliol but went straight from school into the army as a lieutenant in the 22nd battalion, Royal Fusiliers. In 1916 he was severely wounded in the leg and was invalided out, although not until 1918. He surmounted his war wound sufficiently to go up to Balliol (1918&#150;20) and to sit the civil service entry examination in July 1920, passing second and joining the Treasury. His wounds, however, remained throughout his life, involving him in forty-five surgical operations with long periods in hospital and a major daily task of cleaning and plugging the huge hole in his leg.<br>
<br>In spite of his wound, of which the stick he always carried was a reminder, Woods remained an exuberant personality and a very clubbable man. John Henry, as he was universally and affectionately known, was good company, with an abundance of stories and a keen sense of fun. He was able to play cricket with the help of a runner and to complete a full round of golf. He could also indulge his passion for listening to good music. In 1928 he had attended the Imperial Defence College and in 1929 he served as assistant private secretary to the prince of Wales. He married in 1930 Molly, daughter of Noah Henry Baker, who was senior clerk of works, police architect and surveyors' department, Scotland Yard. They had one son and one daughter and enjoyed a very happy and full married life.<br>
<br>When Woods rejoined the Treasury he was in charge in the 1930s of the provision of government finance for work-creation schemes and the building of the new Cunard ocean liners, and secretary of the <span class="roman">Trade Facilities Act</span> advisory committee. He was also much in contact with the accountancy profession to which the Treasury turned for guidance on the role of public funds to rescue industries in difficulties. The friendships he formed in the world of industrial finance were subsequently strengthened in the war years and after; and in the discharge of his various responsibilities his powers matured.<br>
<br>In 1931 Woods was appointed private secretary to Philip Snowden, chancellor of the exchequer and later lord privy seal, who remained one of his heroes for his courage and integrity. In 1936 he became principal private secretary to Neville Chamberlain as chancellor of the exchequer and then in 1937&#150;40 to his successor, Sir John Simon. In normal circumstances he would have gone on to be head of a department but instead, with the country now at war, he was promoted to principal assistant secretary at the Treasury and put in charge of expenditure for the armed services&#151;not a congenial job to one who had served throughout the First World War. His most important tasks were to formulate government policy on the pricing of munitions, supplemented by evidence on contract procedures to the public accounts committee; and, after appointment in 1943 as permanent secretary of the Ministry of Production, to co-ordinate munitions production in alliance with the chief executive, Sir Robert Sinclair, an alliance that continued in the post-war period under Churchill's brief caretaker government, when the ministry was merged with the Board of Trade.<br>
<br>In 1945, when the Labour government took over and Cripps succeeded Oliver Lyttelton as president of the Board of Trade, Woods, who was knighted (KCB) in that year (GCB, 1949), continued as permanent secretary. Although he and Cripps seemed at opposite extremes in personality they collaborated successfully, with mutual respect and understanding. His service at the board continued through six strenuous post-war years that formed the apogee of his career. The staff of the board had grown from 2400 before the war to 15,000, with responsibilities ranging from the great diversity of controls introduced in wartime to the export drive aiming to increase the volume of exports from 30 per cent of the pre-war volume to 150 (or even 175) per cent. The burden of securing effective co-ordination between different areas of policy was a very heavy one, however much was delegated to senior staff, and was not made easier by his loss of an eye in an accident. There were also periods&#151;for example, before devaluation in 1949&#151;when Woods was on extended sick leave.<br>
<br>The pressure continued when Harold Wilson took over from Cripps in 1947. Woods was asked to take on new duties such as membership of the Economic Planning Board. It was a period dominated by controls, in which the conditions for their removal were hard to create. He gave much thought to the action that might be taken and to preparing Harold Wilson's bonfire of controls. It was at this time that he drew attention to the move to replace controls by some form of voluntary action which he christened &#145;voluntaryism&#146;, observing that it sounded like &#145;the occupational disease of a church organist&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>In 1950 Woods was appointed chairman of a Treasury organization committee charged with examining how the Treasury conducted its affairs and distributed its responsibilities. But by this time he was finding the pressure of work beyond his powers and decided to retire from the civil service. Early in 1951 he accepted an invitation from his friend Sir George Nelson to join the board of the English Electric Company as an executive director. He played an important part over the next decade in the expansion in the company's business overseas and developed a close association, on behalf of English Electric, with a number of other companies.<br>
<br>Released from the pressure of government work, Woods was able to take on duties to which he felt attracted. As a devout Christian he gave priority to service to the Church of England in membership of the church's central committees, particularly the central board of finance, and sought to provide additional help to archbishops. Throughout the 1950s he accepted one appointment after another; in 1952 he was elected president of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and accepted membership of the committee on the Churchill Falls development power scheme in Canada; in 1953 he joined the advisory committee of the Revolving Fund for Industry and the Waverley committee on atomic energy; in 1954 he took part in the inquiry into the administrative and disciplinary consequences of the Crichel Down affair, and in 1957&#150;9 he served as a member of the Radcliffe committee on the working of the monetary system. In addition to this sequence of responsibilities he was a visiting fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, a director of the Sadler's Wells Trust Ltd, a governor of the Administrative Staff College at Henley, and treasurer of the British School at Rome.<br>
<br>In 1962 Woods's long spell of ill health forced him into a wheelchair and put an end to his active life. Later in the year, on 2 December, he died at his home, Burchetts, Haywards Heath, Sussex.<br>
