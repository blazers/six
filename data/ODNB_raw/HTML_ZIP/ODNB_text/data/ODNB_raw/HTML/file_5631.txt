<span class="headword">Clerke,  Thomas Henry Shadwell</span>  (1792&#150;1849), <span class="occ">army officer and military journalist</span>, was born at Bandon, co. Cork. Intended for the army, a profession also adopted by his brothers, St John Augustus Clerke, who died a lieutenant-general and colonel in the 75th foot on 17 January 1870, and William Clerke, afterwards a major in the 77th foot, he was sent to the Royal Military College, Great Marlow, where he distinguished himself, and was appointed to an ensigncy without purchase in 1808. As a subaltern in the 28th and 5th foot he served through the Peninsular campaigns until he lost his right leg in the engagement at Redinha in 1811 and was incapacitated for further active service. On the recommendation of Lord Wellington he was promoted to a company in the 1st garrison battalion, with which he served until its reduction in 1814. He afterwards served with the 2nd battalion 57th, and on the army depot staff. He was promoted to a majority unattached in 1830, and was made KH in 1831.<br>
<br>Clerke became first editor of <span class="italic">Colburn's United Service Magazine</span> in January 1829, and so continued until July 1842. On the death of Colonel Gurwood, he was entrusted with the task of seeing through the press the last volume of <span class="italic">Selections from the Wellington Despatches</span>. Although his name does not appear as the author of any scientific or other works, he was an active member of the British Association and of various learned societies. At the time of his death he was a fellow of the Royal Society (elected 10 April 1833), a vice-president of the Royal United Service Institution, of which he had been one of the founders, and a fellow of the Royal Astronomical and Geological societies; for a short time he had been honorary foreign secretary of the Royal Geographical Society. Clerke died at his residence in Brompton Grove, London, of &#145;paralysis&#146;, on 19 April 1849.<br>
