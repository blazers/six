<span class="headword">Galloway,  Janet Anne</span>  (1841&#150;1909), <span class="occ">promoter of higher education for women in Scotland</span>, was born at Birdston Cottage, Birdston, parish of Campsie, Stirlingshire, on 10 October 1841, the elder daughter of Alexander Galloway (1802&#150;1883), estate factor, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bald, of Carsebridge, Alloa (<i>d</i>. 1889). The family moved to Glasgow in 1844, where Alexander commenced business as land agent, valuator, and accountant, residing at 59 Bath Street, Glasgow, from 1857. Janet was the only one of their four children to survive to adulthood; two brothers died in infancy and a sister, Eliza Margaret, died in 1855 aged eight.<br>
<br>Janet Galloway was educated in Scotland and then sent abroad to schools in France, Germany, and Holland, her father believing that &#145;as much pain should be taken about girls as boys&#146;  (Jardine, 56). On her return, she was trained by her father in bookkeeping, office work, and business methods. Finding by experience the limited range of employment open to women, which was due to their restricted education, she became an ardent supporter of the movement to provide higher education for women. In 1877 she became honorary secretary of the newly established Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women, founded by Jessie Campbell and others, to offer women opportunities of study at university level. She earnestly worked to provide teaching for women in university arts subjects, drawing up schemes of instruction, devising standards and methods of teaching, and securing lecturers and examiners. In 1883 the association was incorporated as Queen Margaret College, and she became its first secretary, continuing to refuse any payment for her duties. She had been her father's constant companion and housekeeper, and after his death in 1883 she moved into rooms in the college, the former North Park House in Hamilton Drive, Glasgow, donated by Isabella Elder.<br>
<br>Queen Margaret College amalgamated with Glasgow University in 1892 after the Scottish universities commissioners issued an ordinance empowering Scottish universities to make provision for the instruction and graduation of women. Janet Galloway became a university official, and although new duties were placed on her she still refused to be paid. She helped to promote a corporate life among the students, organizing social gatherings and encouraging the formation of societies and a union. She would keep in touch with them after they left the college, taking a very keen interest in their careers, and promoted the formation of a women graduates association. She helped to found and run the Queen Margaret Guild (1885) which provided lectures for the university extension movement, was a founder of the students' residence, Queen Margaret Hall (1894), and was a prominent member of the executive committee of the Queen Margaret Settlement Association (1897), a social work programme carried out by students. She was also a member of the Teachers' Guild and from 1905 was one of the university's representatives on the Glasgow Provincial Committee for the Training of Teachers. Although baptized into the Church of Scotland she was a devoted member of St Mary's Episcopalian Cathedral in Glasgow. She was also an accomplished pianist and had a deep love of music.<br>
<br>Janet Galloway, who was unmarried, was described as being blunt and having a &#145;ready fearless wit and kind eye&#146;. Her personality was a mixture of conservative instinct and progressive act. She did not intend at first that Queen Margaret College should equip women to compete professionally with men but that it should better prepare them for their traditional roles. She personally preferred single-sex education for women but welcomed the changes that opened universities to women and eventually to co-education. She was a Conservative in politics and disapproved of women's suffrage, as well as being thoroughly opposed to the idea of female lecturers working in the college. Initially doubtful about the wisdom of establishing a medical school for women, she then spent years planning its proper layout and was very proud that she helped produce the first two female medical graduates from a Scottish university in 1894.<br>
<br>Janet Galloway followed closely educational trends in Great Britain, Europe, and North America, and in 1893 represented Queen Margaret College at the Chicago Great Exhibition. In 1907 she received the honorary degree of doctor of laws from Glasgow University in recognition of her lifetime of gratuitous service to the higher education of women. She died in harness at Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow, on 23 January 1909, having continued in her duties despite failing health. She would not hear of resting and attended an educational conference in Edinburgh the evening before her death. She was buried in Lennoxtown cemetery, Campsie, on 26 January. A fund was raised and a memorial window entitled <span class="italic">The Pursuit of Ideal Education</span> was installed in the Bute Hall, Glasgow University, in honour of a woman who had unselfishly devoted her life to the advancement of education, the pursuit of learning, and the fulfilment of women's potential.<br>
