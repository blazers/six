<span class="headword">Goldbeter,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1337&#150;1364), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was probably the son of another John Goldbeter, of York. His career is of interest because he became involved on the margins of royal finance during the 1340s as the combined result of family connections and wartime opportunities. In the summer of 1337 he was imprisoned in Bruges in the course of a general seizure of English merchants and their goods. On that occasion he was described as servant and cousin of Henry Goldbeter (bailiff of York in 1333 and mayor in 1346), which implies that he was still a young man. From about this period, however, he began trading on his own account. When, in 1337, Edward III organized a monopolistic company to handle English wool exports, Goldbeter had a small share in it. In late 1337 or early 1338 he defied the royal seizure of wool at Dordrecht and Middelburg by withdrawing surreptitiously his consignment of 9 sacks and 6 stones and disposing of them to Flemish buyers, an offence for which he was fined &pound;200. From this time until at least 1361 he was engaged in overseas trade, chiefly as an exporter of wool, sometimes as a smuggler. On several occasions he contrived to escape punishment for trading offences because of his services to the crown.<br>
<br>From 1341 Goldbeter was one of the English merchants who benefited from Edward III's reliance upon English merchants to fund his campaigns abroad. This was the time when, in return for commercial privileges, English merchants were taking over services to the crown previously performed by Italian merchant companies. Goldbeter was involved with other York merchants in eight separate loans to the crown between December 1338 and the autumn of 1340, mostly in exchange for freedom from customs duties. Between 1340 and 1342 he also sold wool abroad for the king, as well as trading on his own account, mainly through northern ports.<br>
<br>Goldbeter did not participate directly in any of the syndicates that undertook to collect customs duties for the king between July 1343 and September 1351. However, between May 1346 and April 1349 the customs were leased by Walter Cheriton and his partners in return for loans to the king, and in order to supply loans at the times the king wanted them Cheriton and Company had to borrow. A consortium of York merchants headed by Goldbeter, while avoiding any direct obligations to the crown, was one of the groups that supplied the necessary funds. Between March 1347 and August 1348 they advanced at least &pound;20,649 8<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. (nearly a sixth of the amount that Cheriton and Company are known to have lent the king) to be repaid out of the customs. In addition Cheriton and Company allowed Goldbeter and his partners freedom to export large amounts of wool without paying customs&#151;this during a period of partial embargo on wool exports. It was presumably, too, in recognition of his financial services that the king gave Goldbeter some messuages in Calais, following its capture on 3 August 1347. The assets of Cheriton and Company were seized by the king in March 1349. Documents that Goldbeter surrendered to the king on that occasion constitute the most important source of information concerning Cheriton's activities. In 1352 Cheriton and Company prosecuted Goldbeter for debt, but Goldbeter was able to establish that in fact the balance of outstanding obligation was the other way round.<br>
<br>Goldbeter never held civic office in York, and it may not have been his normal place of residence after his youth. He spent time in Flanders from his early years in the wool trade, and often worked closely with Flemish merchants. In the spring of 1341 he had licence to export wool in partnership with John Cokelare, <i>&eacute;chevin</i> (municipal magistrate) of Bruges. He lived in Bruges during the siege of Calais, acting with others on behalf of Cheriton and Company and bailing them out of difficulties. In the late summer of 1348 he was again in Bruges, trading through agents in English ports along the east coast. Frequent (or even normal) residence in Bruges perhaps accounts for the paucity of information concerning his career after 1349. He was later said to have collaborated with Flemish merchants illegally in the export of English wool to Flanders between 1353 and 1356. In 1361 he was governor of the English merchants at Bruges. In that year he, with another English merchant and a Fleming, had shares in a ship trading to Nantes under the command of a Flemish skipper. Though outlawed in England in 1362, at the suit of his old rival William de la Pole, for failing to answer charges relating to his illegal activities in 1353&#150;6, Goldbeter was eventually pardoned on 20 November 1364 at the request of Louis de M&acirc;le, count of Flanders. Nothing is known of him after that date.<br>
