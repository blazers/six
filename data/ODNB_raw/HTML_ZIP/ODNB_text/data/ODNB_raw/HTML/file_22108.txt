<span class="headword">Philipot <span class="st"> [Philpot]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1589&#150;1645), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was born at Folkestone, Kent, the second of seven sons and nine children of Henry Philpot (1543/4&#150;1603), a property owner who was thrice mayor of Folkestone, and his wife, Judith, daughter and coheir of David Leigh, servant to the archbishop of Canterbury. In his will dated 1602 Henry Philpot made provision for John, who was then at school, to be apprenticed to such trade as his father's executors thought most fit.<br>
<br>On 20 June 1604 John Philpot was bound apprentice to Edmund Houghton in the Drapers' Company. He was made free on 26 June 1611 and an apprentice was bound to him on 1 April 1612 for eight years. On 28 December 1612 Philpot married, at St George the Martyr, Canterbury, Susan (<i>d</i>. 1665), only child and heir of William Glover of Sandwich, Kent, the brother of Robert Glover, Somerset herald (1544&#150;1588). They had two sons and two daughters: the elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22109/', "Thomas Philipot (d. 1682)")</script> became a poet and writer. The marriage licence described Philpot as &#145;John Philpot of the City of London, woollen draper&#146; and he seems to have intended to continue this business after his marriage as a second apprentice was bound to him on 12 May 1613 for seven years. However, possibly as the result of his marriage, Philpot was in a financial position to accept appointment on 10 December 1613 as Blanch Lyon pursuivant-extraordinary. From this time he wrote his name as &#145;Philipot&#146;.<br>
<br>By patent dated 13 November 1618 Philipot was promoted to Rouge Dragon pursuivant in ordinary and despite objections from Garter and Norroy that so profitable a position should be given to someone so junior in the College of Arms, William Camden, Clarenceux, thought sufficiently highly of Philipot to make him his deputy for the visitation of Kent in 1619. He was subsequently Camden's deputy for the visitation of Hampshire, 1622&#150;3, and jointly with Chester herald for Gloucestershire and Berkshire in 1623. On 10 July 1623 he was appointed to the lucrative post of land and water bailiff of Sandwich, Kent, in succession to his wife's cousin Thomas Milles, and in July 1625 a warrant was issued for payment to him of &pound;250 for the repair of Sandwich gaol. In 1628 the office of bailiff was regranted to him jointly with Gabriel Marsh, whose wife, Judith, was the only child of Philipot's elder brother, Thomas, and in 1642 after Marsh's death the office was regranted for the joint lives of Philipot and his younger son, John. He also held the office of lieutenant or chief gunner of the fort of Tilbury with a daily fee of 1<i>s</i>.<br>
<br>Philipot was appointed Somerset herald by patent dated 28 June 1624, having purchased the office from Robert Treswell who had debts, but on 2 November 1624 he was fined &pound;5 for keeping back fees due to the College of Arms and lost his heraldic profits for October 1624. In January 1628 there was a complaint that he was keeping an admiralty court at Faversham, thereby depriving the lord warden of the Cinque Ports of the salvage brought in by fishermen. He was returned as one of the members of parliament for Sandwich on 12 March 1628 and sat until that parliament was dissolved on 10 March 1629. In 1628 James Balfour, subsequently Lyon king of arms, went to London and dined with the heralds, when he wrote that Philipot was noted for &#145;eloquence, oratorie [and] diversitie in languages&#146;  (Wagner, <span class="italic">Heralds</span>, 232). By 1630 he was steward of the royal manors of Gillingham and Grain in Kent. On 25 November 1630 he was accused by Clarenceux of invading his rights with regard to a funeral and allowing quarterings on funeral banners without justification.<br>
<br>In November 1632 Philipot accompanied Lord Arundel on a mission to The Hague to try to persuade the widowed queen of Bohemia, sister of Charles I, to return to England, and as Garter's deputy he invested her son Charles Lewis, the elector palatine of the Rhine, with the Order of the Garter at Bokstal, Netherlands, on 28 May 1633. He was still at The Hague on 29 August 1633, being paid thirty shillings a day, when the queen of Bohemia wrote to Lady Arundel:<blockquote>this bearer Mr. Philpot can tell you all the newes here, I have stayed him of purpose to carie the King my brother some newes of it. &hellip; he is a verie honest man and done all the right that can be to his place and his master's honour in that he was imployed in. (M. F. S. Hervey, <span class="italic">The Life, Correspondence and Collections of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel</span>, 1921, 344)</blockquote>In 1633 Philipot and York herald were deputed to visit Sussex, and the following year Philipot alone continued the 1622&#150;3 visitation of Hampshire, then with Bluemantle pursuivant that of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. On 8 August 1635 Philipot was admitted a member of Lincoln's Inn at the request of the recorder of London. Before 18 July 1637 he was appointed registrar of the College of Arms and in the same month Philipot obtained a privilege for twenty-one years for the sole printing and selling of a book to be called &#145;The new description of Kent&#146;. In his will Philipot directed that his executrix and overseer shall &#145;cause to be imprinted my book of the Survey of Kent wherein I have taken soe great labor and pains&#146;. It was never published, although it has been suggested that his son Thomas Philipot's <span class="italic">Villare Cantianum, or, Kent Surveyed and Illustrated</span> (1659) was mainly his father's work; however, James Greenstreet writing in <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span> (5th ser., 1879, 11.92) concluded that if the father had a hand in the compilation it would have been more exhaustive and more reliable. In December 1638 proceedings were brought against Philipot and Sir Henry St George, Norroy, as Philipot had persuaded St George to forge the signature of his father, Sir Richard St George (<i>d</i>. 1635) as Clarenceux on a grant of arms to a Kentish man who was not a gentleman. Both St George and Philipot were fined and suspended from office on 19 March 1639 but later pardoned on 6 April 1640. In a letter dated 20 April 1640 Sir Thomas Peyton referred to Philipot as &#145;the Maltman Viceroy of Sandwich for soe his authority and place denominate him&#146;  (London, 37). Unless he combined the business of maltster with his many other activities the maltman reference is not clear.<br>
<br>In 1642 Philipot accompanied Charles I to Oxford and on 18 July 1643 received the honorary degree of doctor of civil law there. On 10 August 1643 he and the York herald accompanied Charles I at the siege of Gloucester and carried to that city the king's summons to surrender, which was refused. He returned to Oxford but was captured at Chawley by parliamentarian soldiers and sent to London in or after May 1645. His property was sequestrated on 26 September 1645, when he was stated to be worth &pound;52 19<i>s</i>. per annum. Philipot died in London on 22 November 1645 and was buried as Fillpot at St Benet Paul's Wharf on 25 November. In his will dated 15 November 1645 he describes himself as &#145;of Eltham in Kent Esquire designed Norroy King of Arms&#146; believing that he would obtain this vacancy, and this appears on his widow's memorial at Eltham. He bequeathed some of his books of heraldry to his son Thomas &#145;at the rate they are [ap]praised at&#146;  (will).<br>
<br>John Philipot was a collector of both heraldic manuscripts and charters. A large number of these had come into the possession of Onslow Gardiner by 1648 and were subsequently acquired by Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey. After his death they were purchased for the College of Arms for &pound;50, where about 130 volumes, many of which are bound together, still remain. They are primarily genealogical with many copies of heralds' visitations, almost all south of the River Trent; the collection also contains manuscripts compiled by Robert Glover and William Smith, Rouge Dragon. In 1640 108 of Philipot's charters were copied into Sir Christopher Hatton's <span class="italic">Book of Seals</span>. Some of these are in the British Library, fifty-four in the Harley collection and thirteen among the Cotton charters.<br>
