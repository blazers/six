<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  Patrick</span>, seventeenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw  (<em>c.</em>1551&#150;1600), <span class="occ">landowner and rebel</span>, was the eldest of five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9617/', "Thomas Fitzmaurice, sixteenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw (c.1502&#150;1590)")</script>, landowner and rebel, and his first wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1564), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9560/', "James fitz John Fitzgerald, thirteenth earl of Desmond")</script>. He was born in Kerry. He was sent to court during Mary I's reign so that he might receive an English education, learning the language and customs in order to instil obedience. Fitzmaurice, however, was also a hostage whose presence at court helped to ensure his father's loyalty. By the early 1570s Kerry had ably demonstrated his loyalty and Fitzmaurice, favoured at Elizabeth I's court, was permitted to return to Ireland.<br>
<br>Upon his arrival Fitzmaurice impetuously aligned himself with his cousin Gerald Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond. His father complained &#145;Desmond does prick forward my wilful son against me&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/48/70(ii)). Fitzmaurice joined Desmond in rebellion in 1580, but was captured and imprisoned in Limerick Castle. With the possible assistance of his gaoler, John Sheriff, clerk of the ordnance, Fitzmaurice escaped in August 1581 and took refuge among the Irish. His father reluctantly joined the rebellion in May 1582 and Fitzmaurice embarked for Spain with the Catholic bishop of Killaloe in September seeking reinforcements. Yet significant foreign aid was not forthcoming and Fitzmaurice was wounded at Dingle, Kerry, following his return in early 1583. Despite receiving a pardon in 1585 he remained suspect&#151;his escape from Limerick was estimated to have cost the queen &pound;20,000. He was recaptured in 1587 and imprisoned in Dublin in March 1588.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice was the last participant in Desmond's rebellion to be released. Attempts made by Sir William Herbert, an influential Munster planter, to secure his release fell on deaf ears. Fitzmaurice's wife, Joan or Jane, daughter of David Roche, fifth Baron Roche of Fermoy, and Ellen, daughter of James Butler of Dunboyne, Meath, journeyed to Dublin, but met with a similar response. In early 1591 he was reunited with his wife and five children. He had become seventeenth Lord Kerry following his father's death in 1590. Kerry had the misfortune of presiding over the transfer of many of his ancestral lands to the planters who flooded Munster in the wake of Desmond's rebellion. With little more to lose, he joined the rebellion that swept through Munster in December 1598. He pulled down his principal castle of Beaulieu to prevent its falling to the English. But, faced with ruin, he died soon after on 12 August 1600 at Downlough, Kerry. He was buried with his uncle, the earl of Clancare, in the Grey Friary of Irrelaugh in Kerry. He was survived by his wife, and succeeded by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9618/', "Thomas Fitzmaurice, as eighteenth baron of Kerry and Lixnaw")</script>.<br>
