<span class="headword">Waley,  Jacob</span>  (1818&#150;1873), <span class="occ">barrister and Anglo-Jewish community leader</span>, was the elder son of Solomon Jacob Waley (<i>d</i>. 1864), of London, and his wife, Rachel Hort. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28459/', "Simon Waley")</script>, pianist and composer, was his brother. Educated in London at Mr Neumegen's school in Highgate and at University College, in 1839 he graduated BA at the University of London, coming top of his year in both mathematics and classics, a feat which earned him a gold medal. His initial ambition was to practise as a solicitor, but after a year he determined on a career at the bar, and entered Lincoln's Inn, where he became a pupil of Lord Justice Rolt; he was called to the bar on 21 November 1842, one of the earliest professing Jews to achieve this distinction. On 28 July 1847, in a ceremony conducted by the chief rabbi, Dr Nathan Adler, Waley married Matilda, third daughter of Joseph Salomons and his wife, Rebecca, sister of Sir Moses Montefiore. There were several children of the marriage, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55565/', "Julia Cohen (1853&#150;1917)")</script>. Another daughter, Rachel Sophia, married the economist and Fabian socialist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47799/', "David Frederick Schloss")</script>; their children included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36683/', "Arthur Waley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36684/', "Sir David Waley")</script>.<br>
<br>Waley specialized in conveyancing, becoming in time one of the most respected conveyancers of his day. Although conveyancers rarely appeared in court, he was several times summoned in cases of particular difficulty and acted as conveyancing counsel for the Bedford estates. In collaboration with T. C. and C. D. Wright he edited Davidson's <span class="italic">Precedents and Forms in Conveyancing</span> (5 vols., London, 1855&#150;65). In 1870 he was appointed one of the conveyancing counsel of the court of chancery. He had previously, in 1867, served as a member of the royal commission on the transfer of land; the legislation on this subject, approved by parliament in 1874, was based substantially upon his opinions.<br>
<br>Waley was a stereotypical &#145;emancipated&#146; Jew, one of the generation of British Jews who took full advantage of the atmosphere of tolerance and civic equality which characterized the Victorian age. He was an expert in political economy, acting as examiner in this subject for the University of London; in 1853 he was appointed professor of political economy at University College, London, a post he was compelled to resign some thirteen years later owing to pressure of other work. He was also, until his death, joint secretary of the Political Economy Club.<br>
<br>A nephew by marriage of both Sir Moses Montefiore and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24562/', "Sir David Salomons")</script>, Waley was centrally placed within &#145;the cousinhood&#146; which ruled Anglo-Jewry in the nineteenth century, and he played a substantial part in its communal affairs. He was one of the originators of the scheme (approved by parliament in 1870) to amalgamate the major Ashkenazi (German-speaking) synagogues in London to form one United Synagogue, whose constitution he drafted. The following year he helped to found the Anglo-Jewish Association&#151;a sort of Anglo-Jewish ministry of foreign affairs&#151;and became its first president. He was also president of the Jews' Orphan Asylum and a member of the council of Jews' College, London, which was established in 1859 as a training centre for the Anglo-Jewish ministry. He was prominent in the Hebrew Literary Society and in the Jewish Board of Guardians. He took much interest in the treatment of Jews abroad and in 1872 wrote a brief preface to <span class="italic">The Jews of Roumania</span>, published by the Anglo-Jewish Association, in protest against the persecution of Jews in that country.<br>
<br>Waley died of liver disease at his home, 20 Wimpole Street, London, on 19 June 1873, and was buried in the United Synagogue's West Ham cemetery. He was survived by his wife. It was a measure of the communal esteem in which he was held that the funeral was attended by both Sir Moses Montefiore and Sir Francis Goldsmid, lay leaders respectively of the Orthodox and Reform Jewish communities in Britain, and by Chief Rabbi Adler.<br>
