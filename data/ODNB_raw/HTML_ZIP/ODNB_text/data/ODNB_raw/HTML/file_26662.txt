<span class="headword">Stretton <span class="st"> [Eyrik]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1385), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</span>, came from Leicestershire. Usually surnamed Stretton, from his presumed birthplace at Stretton Magna, Leicestershire, his family name was apparently Eyrik. However, suggestions of links with the later Eyricks of Houghton are unsubstantiated. He possibly inherited lands at Stretton, as he held the manor in the 1370s. In 1378 he named his parents as Robert (son of John) and Joan, and also identified two brothers (Sir William, a knight, and John, a cleric) and a sister (Atheline), who were all dead. Although these too are named Stretton, John is also called John Eyrik, and the dissolution certificate for his chantry calls the bishop &#145;Robert Heyrick&#146;.<br>
<br>Of Stretton's education and upbringing nothing is known. He is occasionally called master, but no specific degree is identified (the tradition that he was a doctor of laws and an auditor of the <span class="italic">Rota Romana</span> is mistaken). He began his ecclesiastical career as a dependent of Edward, the Black Prince (<i>d</i>. 1376), for whom he was successively clerk, almoner (by March 1347), and confessor (by May 1349). He already held the rectory of Wigston, Leicestershire, when he was granted an expectative to a Chichester canonry in 1343. As a result of petitions to the pope and his connections with the Black Prince, he later acquired canonries and prebends at Lincoln, Gnosall, London, and Salisbury, and in St Asaph and Llandaff, and the rectory of Llanbadarn Fawr in the diocese of St David's. (A papal bull in 1360 said that he was a canon of Lichfield when elected bishop, but this seems to be incorrect.)<br>
<br>Stretton appears in secular employment as a king's clerk from 1350. In 1347 he was nominated as an envoy in abortive negotiations for a marriage between the prince of Wales and a daughter of the king of Portugal, and in 1355 was among those mandated by the pope to avert hostilities between the Black Prince and the count of Ponthieu. In 1350 he obtained a mortmain licence to found a chantry at Stretton, but this was not immediately implemented.<br>
<br>Following Bishop Roger Northburgh's death in November 1358 Stretton was elected bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, presumably with royal and princely support. Royal assent was granted on 21 January 1359, but the appointment then stalled, for two years. According to the fourteenth-century <span class="italic">Vitae archiepiscoporum Cantuariensium</span> (variously embroidered by later historians) Stretton was summoned to Avignon to have his literacy assessed, and was rejected. Following pressure from the prince of Wales the pope commissioned the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of Rochester to hold a further examination. This tale cannot be adequately corroborated. The final papal bull of 22 April 1360 states that Stretton was elected in ignorance of a papal reservation of the see, and had gone to Avignon to argue his case. The cardinals had judged him a fit candidate and there was no outstanding provision, so the decision on confirmation and provision was left to Canterbury and Rochester, unless Archbishop Simon Islip (<i>d</i>. 1366) deputed the bishop of London to act for him. Because of pressure of business Islip did just that. There is no sign of reluctance or opposition. In any event, Stretton was consecrated on 27 September 1360. His profession of obedience to Canterbury was read for him, for unstated reasons, although he did subscribe personally. Given his career and qualifications, illiteracy seems inconceivable, but it is possible that he was already afflicted by the deterioration of his eyesight which was later to deprive him of all vision, and which may also explain, at least in part, the quiet course of his later career.<br>
<br>Stretton's governance of his see was relatively straightforward and efficient. There are occasional hints of discord between himself and the Lichfield Cathedral chapter; but in general relations were amicable. In 1369 his anniversary was established within the cathedral, at the altar of St Andrew. The pope presumably thought that he retained influence with Edward III, as in 1371 he was asked to intercede to secure the admission of cardinals Simon Langham (<i>d</i>. 1376) and Jean de Dormans to England. In 1378 he arranged for the shrine of St Ceadda (Chad) to be moved to a new location. His pontificate had occasional dramatic incidents. When he visited Repton Priory in 1364, the townspeople invaded the priory compound, and blockaded the bishop and his household in the buildings. They were released only with assistance. Unsurprisingly Stretton fulminated excommunication and interdict against the perpetrators. From 1376 (if not earlier) he was consistently absent from parliament, possibly because of declining health. In September 1378 he finally established the chantry at Stretton Magna originally envisaged in 1350. (The tradition that he augmented another chantry at Stretton-on-Dunsmore, Staffordshire, is based on a misunderstanding.) He had become totally blind by 7 September 1381, and the prior and convent of Canterbury (<i>sede vacante</i>) ordered him to appoint a coadjutor for the see. He died at Haywood in Staffordshire, one of his episcopal residences, on 28 March 1385, and was buried in St Andrew's Chapel in Lichfield Cathedral. His relatively uninformative will, with few specific bequests, was drawn up on 19 March and probated on 10 April. What was probably his tomb was described and depicted by later antiquaries, but no longer survives.<br>
