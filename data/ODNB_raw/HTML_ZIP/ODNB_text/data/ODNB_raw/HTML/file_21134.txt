<span class="headword">Painter,  Edward <span class="st"> [Ned]</span></span>  (1784&#150;1852), <span class="occ">pugilist</span>, was born at Stretford, 4 miles from Manchester, in 1784, and as a young man worked as a brewer. He may have been the infant baptized at St Mary's Church, Stretford, on 15 February 1784, the son of John and Mary Painter. A quarrel with a fellow employee in the brewery called Wilkins&#151;a man of heavy build&#151;led to a formal fight in the yard of The Swan inn, Manchester, where Painter quickly defeated his opponent and showed unusual power as a boxer. After receiving some training under his fellow countryman Bob Gregson, he was matched to fight J. Coyne, an Irish boxer from Kilkenny, 6 feet tall and weighing 14 stone. Painter weighed 13 stone; his height was 5 feet 9&frac34; inches. The men met at St Nicholas, near Margate, on 23 August 1813, when, after a fight of forty minutes, the Irishman was beaten. J. Alexander, known as the Gamekeeper, was Painter's next opponent, at Moulsey Hurst, Surrey, on 20 November 1813. In the twentieth round the victory seemed to be going to the challenger, but Painter, with a straight, well-directed hit, stunned the Gamekeeper, and became the victor. He was now reckoned a match for Tom Oliver, but in the fight, which took place on 17 May 1814, his luck for the first time deserted him. For a purse of 50 guineas he next took on John Shaw, the lifeguardsman, at Hounslow Heath, Middlesex, on 18 April 1815, when the height and weight of Shaw prevailed after twenty-eight minutes.<br>
<br>On 23 July 1817 Painter met Harry Sutton, the black fighter, at Moulsey Hurst, and after forty-eight minutes found himself unable to continue the encounter. Not satisfied with the result, he again challenged Sutton to meet him at Bungay in Suffolk on 16 December 1817. The event excited great interest, and, despite rainy weather, 15,000 people assembled. There was a quadrangle of 24 feet for the combatants to engage in, with an outer roped ring for the officials. Outside this stood the spectators, several rows deep, and three circles of wagons surrounded the whole, giving the ring the appearance of an amphitheatre. This time Sutton, although he fought with great spirit, conceded defeat at the close of the fifteenth round. At Stepney, on 21 March 1817, Painter undertook for a wager to throw half a hundredweight against Mr Donovan, a man of great size, and beat him by 18&frac12; inches. He was equally good at running. On 7 November 1817, on the Essex Road, in a 5 mile race against an athlete named Spring, he ran the distance in thirty-five and a half minutes.<br>
<br>The well-known Thomas Winter, alias Spring, was the next to engage with Painter, in a fight on Mickleham Downs, Surrey, on 1 April 1818. After thirty-one rounds, occupying eighty-nine minutes, Spring was victorious. The two men fought again on 7 August 1818, at Russia Farm, 5 miles from Kingston. In the first round Spring was floored by a blow over the eye, from which, although he continued fighting to the forty-second round, he never completely recovered. Painter now became landlord of The Anchor, Lobster Lane, Norwich, and intended to give up fighting, but on 17 July 1820 he again met his old opponent Tom Oliver, at North Walsham, and on this occasion was the victor. It is remarkable that Painter was defeated at the first attempt by Oliver, Sutton, and Spring, but in each case won the rematch. For many years he lived at The Anchor, then removed to the White Hart inn, Market Place, Norwich. He occasionally played a role in the arrangement of fights and was instrumental in founding a Norwich pugilistic club. Painter died at the home of his son, near The Ram, Lakenham, Norwich, on 18 September 1852, and was buried in St Peter's churchyard, Lakenham, on 22 September.<br>
