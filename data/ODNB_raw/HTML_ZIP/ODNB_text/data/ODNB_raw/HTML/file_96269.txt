<span class="headword">Bywater,  (Richard) Arthur Samuel</span>  (1913&#150;2005), <span class="occ">munitions factory official</span>, was born on 3 November 1913 at 1 Teignmouth Road, Selly Oak, Birmingham, the third son of Walter Bywater, clerk at a tinplate works, later chief clerk of stores at the Austin Motor Company, Longbridge, Birmingham, and his wife, Florence Amy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mould. He won a scholarship to Kings Norton grammar school, graduated from the University of Birmingham with a first in chemistry, and received the degree of MSc in 1936. After three years as chief chemist at Boxfoldia Ltd, packaging manufacturers, in Redditch, Worcestershire, at the beginning of 1939 he became a technical assistant at the Royal Filling Factory at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. After the outbreak of the Second World War Bywater applied to join the RAF, but was turned down because he was in a reserved occupation, and was put in charge of the experimental department at the Woolwich Arsenal. In the summer of 1940 he took charge of the fuse section.<br>
<br>Because the munitions factories were in London, and at risk from enemy bombing, new factories were built in the west and north-west of the country, areas regarded as safe. One of the new factories was the Royal Ordnance Factory no. 7, a large filling factory built at Kirkby, Lancashire, north-east of Liverpool, which opened in March 1941. The filling factory at the Woolwich Arsenal had been destroyed in an enemy raid in September 1940, and Bywater moved to Kirkby as factory development officer. Most of the employees, mainly women, had the hazardous job of filling anti-tank mine fuses with explosives, and by the beginning of 1944, in preparation for D-day, 150,000 fuses a week were filled by women working a three-shift system, twenty-four hours a day. On 22 February 1944 a fuse exploded, detonating a tray of twenty-five fuses, killing one woman and badly damaging the factory. When Bywater reached the scene with Lawrence Gale, the superintendent of the factory, he realized the danger of further explosions and arranged the evacuation of the building, volunteering to lead a team of volunteers in removing the remaining 12,000 fuses. It was discovered that the original explosion had been caused by a defective striker in the fuse, and 4000 of the remaining fuses were also found to have faulty strikers. They were removed to a site a mile away and detonated: twenty-three were in such a critically sensitive state that he carried each out individually to be destroyed. The operation took two days. He was awarded the George Cross, the highest civilian award for bravery, for his leadership and disregard for personal safety.<br>
<br>A few months later, on 15 September 1944, there was another incident at the Kirkby factory, while workers were filling a set of 8 pound bombs into a container attached to a parachute. Fourteen people were killed in a series of explosions, and again Bywater organized the evacuation of the building: when the fires were extinguished he led the team in the dangerous operation to clear the debris of unexploded ammunition. Each of the 4000 bombs had to be handled separately and taken away for destruction, a job that took three months. In his report the director-general of filling factories wrote: &#145;the work in progress was possibly the most dangerous ever attempted in an industrial factory&#146;  (Hay, 79). For this he was awarded the George Medal, and became the first and only civilian to hold both the GC and the GM.<br>
<br>After the war Bywater became works manager of R. N. Coate and Co., cider makers, at Nailsea in Somerset, near Bristol. In 1947 he married Patricia Ferneyhough: they had one son and one daughter. In 1954 they emigrated to New South Wales, Australia, where he worked for the Mulwala explosives factory and later became assistant manager of St Mary's explosives factory. After moving to Melbourne he became general manager of the banknote printing works of the Reserve Bank of Australia. He retired in 1976 and bought a 240 acre farm at Cobram, on the Murray River in Victoria, before moving to Albury in New South Wales in 1980 to help his daughter and son-in-law in the running of their equestrian business. He died on 6 April 2005 in Australia, and was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
