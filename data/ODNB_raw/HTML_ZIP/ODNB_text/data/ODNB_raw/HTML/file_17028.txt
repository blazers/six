<span class="headword">Lothropp,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1584, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">minister in America</span>, was baptized on 20 December 1584 at Etton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Lothropp (<i>d</i>. 1606) and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1588/9), of Cherry Burton and Etton. He had two brothers, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1629), later rector of Dengie, Essex, and William, and two sisters, Mary and another who later married William Akett of Leconfield, Yorkshire. After matriculating on 15 October 1602 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a sizar to Dr John King, he moved to Queens' College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1606 and proceeded MA in 1609. He was ordained a deacon at Lincoln on 20 December 1607, and served as curate of Bennington, Hertfordshire, before becoming perpetual curate of Egerton, Kent, in 1609. On 10 October 1610 he obtained a licence to marry Hannah, daughter of John Howse, minister of Eastwell, Kent. Their children included five sons, Thomas (21 Feb 1613&#150;29 Sept 1675), Samuel, Joseph (<i>b</i>. 1624), Benjamin, and Fuller (married 8 April 1635), and three daughters, Jane (1614&#150;1634/5), Barbarah (<i>bap</i>. 31 October 1619; married 19 July 1638), and Elizabeth.<br>
<br>About 1624 Lothropp, perhaps influenced by discussions with a group of separatists at Egerton led by John Fenner, resigned his curacy, renounced his ordination, and moved to Southwark. There he joined the Independent congregation founded by Henry Jacob, was elected its pastor in 1625, and was reordained. The congregation split in 1630 after one of the members had a child baptized in the Church of England, an act that sparked calls by some to renounce the established church and become fully fledged separatists, a course recommended by John Canne. When Lothropp and his supporters refused to do so, &#145;not knowing what in time to come God might further manifest to them&#146;  (Burrage, 2.301&#150;2), John Dupper and his followers seceded. In 1632 Lothropp, having obtained notes of John Davenport's sermon against Independency, sent him a substantive critique that changed his mind. On 29 April 1632 Bishop William Laud's pursuivant, one Tomlinson, arrested Lothropp and approximately forty-one of his adherents as they worshipped in the house of a brewer's clerk in Blackfriars. Eighteen members of the church were either absent or escaped. When Lothropp appeared before the court of high commission on 3 May, he claimed that &#145;the Lord hath qualified me&#146; to be a minister and refused to take the oath <i>ex officio</i>, a position he reiterated before the commission on 8 May  (Gardiner, 281). While he was incarcerated, some of his church members left in September 1633 to establish a separatist congregation, the first pastor of which was Samuel Eaton. Lothropp's wife also died while he was in prison.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1634 the high commission ordered Lothropp's release on bond, with the stipulation that he return in Trinity term and not attend conventicles. When he failed to appear, the commission ordered his arrest on 19 June and again on 9 October, and on 19 February 1635 it cited him for contempt and repeated the call for his apprehension. By this time he had sailed for Massachusetts with his church's approval, taking approximately thirty members with him. Nine days after arriving in Boston on 18 September 1634, he went to Scituate at the invitation of its settlers to organize a church. He had the support of the Plymouth congregation, which dismissed its members in the Scituate area on 23 November so they could join Lothropp's group. Following the church's foundation on 8 January 1635, Lothropp was ordained on 19 January. Some time after 8 January Lothropp remarried, for his new wife, Ann, joined the congregation on 14 June 1635. They had six children, Barnabas (<i>bap</i>. 6 June 1636, <i>d</i>. 1715), Abigail (<i>bap</i>. 2 Nov 1639), Bathsua (<i>bap</i>. 27 Feb 1642, <i>d</i>. 1724), John (1645&#150;1727), and two who died at or near birth (1638, 1650). On 7 June 1637 Lothropp was admitted as a freeman of the colony of New Plymouth.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1638 Lothropp and other freemen of Scituate complained to the colony's court of assistants about a shortage of suitable land, and the following month he reported to the governor that he was experiencing numerous problems, including suspicions (which proved unfounded) of plotting between local residents and people in England. He sought new land on which to settle his flock, but not until October 1639 could he and some of his members relocate to Barnstable, in the same colony. He sold his farm at Scituate to Christopher Blackwood, who subsequently returned to England and became a prominent Particular Baptist. A new church was formally organized at Barnstable on 31 October 1639, and John Mayo became Lothropp's assistant the following year. Lothropp served as minister until his death on 8 November 1653. His will bequeathed two houses and several lots at Barnstable to his wife and eldest son, and he left goods valued at &pound;72 16<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. Nathaniel Morton described him as a humble man, a &#145;lively&#146; preacher, and &#145;studious of peace, furnished with godly contentment&#146;  (Morton, 141).<br>
