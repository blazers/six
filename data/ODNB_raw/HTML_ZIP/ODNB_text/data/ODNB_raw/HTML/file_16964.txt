<span class="headword">Long,  Edward</span>  (1734&#150;1813), <span class="occ">planter and commentator on Jamaican affairs</span>, was born on 23 August 1734 at Rosilion, St Blazey, Cornwall, the fourth son of Samuel Long (1700&#150;1757) of Longville, Jamaica, Tredudwell, Cornwall, and Bloomsbury, London, and Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1701, <i>d</i>. 1765), second daughter and coheir of Bartholomew Tate of Delapr&eacute;, Northamptonshire. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds School, at Liskeard (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1752), and at home. He entered Gray's Inn, London, on 28 June 1753. On his father's death in early 1757, Long left his law studies and sailed to Jamaica, although he was called to the bar <i>ex gratia</i>, despite not having kept terms. The Longs had been connected with Jamaica since the 1660s. Long's great-grandfather Samuel had been speaker of the Jamaican assembly and was responsible for many of its procedures. His father, Samuel, born in Jamaica, was a member of the council and the owner of Lucky Valley sugar plantation, a rich property in Clarendon parish. Long took over the running of the plantation and became the private secretary of Lieutenant-Governor Sir Henry Moore, who had married his eldest sister, Catharina Maria. He was soon promoted to the position of judge of the vice-admiralty court in Jamaica. At St Catharine's Church, Jamaica, on 12 August 1758, he married Mary Ballard (1734/5&#150;1797), second daughter and eventually heir of Thomas Beckford of Jamaica and widow of John Palmer. They had six children&#151;three sons (including the army officer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16974/', "Robert Ballard Long")</script>) and three daughters. Edward Long was elected a member of the Jamaican assembly for St Ann parish in 1761, 1765, and 1766. On 13 September 1768 he was elected speaker of the assembly, an office he held only until the house was dissolved on 22 September. In 1769 he left Jamaica because of ill health, and he lived the rest of his life in England. He retained his judicial office in Jamaica until about 1797 but never returned to the Caribbean.<br>
<br>In moving to Britain, Long detached himself from the day-to-day business of running an estate and participating in Jamaican government, and allowed himself the time in which he could take a longer view of Jamaican affairs. For many years he was a member of the West India merchants' and planters' committee, and from his properties in Berkshire, Surrey, Hampshire, and Sussex, and the London house he leased at 46 Wimpole Street, Marylebone, from 1781, he wrote numerous articles for London newspapers as well as pamphlets on the sugar trade and the game laws, and after 1783 wrote regularly about imperial politics as an ally of the Foxite whigs. His most influential work, which cemented his reputation as the leading contemporary commentator on the eighteenth-century British Caribbean, was the three-volume <span class="italic">History of Jamaica, or, General Survey of the Antient and Modern State of that Island</span>, published in 1774. Based on private papers, public records, and his own experience of living in Jamaica, this is an invaluable vade-mecum to the social, economic, and political life of Britain's largest and wealthiest West Indian colony. The book combines encyclopaedic detail with polemics and propaganda; some sections are plagiarized from other writers. The meteorology, botany, zoology, medicine, history, and laws of Jamaica are all covered, but <span class="italic">The History of Jamaica</span> is mainly consulted for its political arguments and its commentary on slavery. Long argued for better schools in Jamaica, for improved military defences, for a stronger militia, for more extensive white immigration, and for a solid church foundation. A staunch supporter of the elected Jamaican assembly, he criticized the governor's power to dismiss judges and suspend the assembly and council. He was a strong pro-slavery advocate who regarded enslaved Africans as subhuman, an inferior species. He thought that transporting enslaved Africans to the Caribbean instilled order and discipline into their lives. He associated slaves with apes in terms of lechery and feared the prospect of slave revolts. He considered the slave trade a profitable business for British interests and portrayed Jamaican slavery as a benevolent institution. He supported the rights of the plantocracy against the power of the imperial government and defended their cause when faced with humanitarian objections to slavery. He also argued, however, that plantation owners were inefficient managers. In his view this deficiency could be overcome when estate owners resided in Jamaica rather than returning as absentees to Britain. Long's work influenced Bryan Edwards's <span class="italic">History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies</span> (1793), another important contemporary work on the Caribbean. Section 2 of Edwards's book, on the origin of the maroons, was in fact taken from Long's <span class="italic">History of Jamaica</span>. Long spent much time revising his <i>magnum opus</i> for a second edition, but this was never completed. His grandson Charles Edward Long gave the British Museum the manuscript sheets of the revision along with much other material on Jamaica gathered by Edward Long.<br>
<br>Long was a cultivated, studious man who wanted his family to be brought up in an intellectual atmosphere. He was an accomplished musician who played a Cremona violin and displayed an interest in science, corresponding with Dr Thomas Dancer, a botanist in Jamaica. Long's wife, Mary, died on 16 July 1797, aged sixty-two; Long himself survived until 13 March 1813, dying at Arundel Park, Sussex, the seat of his son-in-law, Henry Howard-Molyneux. He was buried on 20 March in the chancel of Slindon church, Sussex, where a memorial slab commemorates him.<br>
