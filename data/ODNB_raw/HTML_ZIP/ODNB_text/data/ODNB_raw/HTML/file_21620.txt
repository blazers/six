<span class="headword">Paulet, Sir  Amias</span>  (<em>c.</em>1457&#150;1538), <span class="occ">landowner and soldier</span>, was the only son of Sir William Paulet (<i>c</i>.1404&#150;1488) of Hinton St George and Elizabeth, daughter of John Deneland of Hinton St George. Paulet was brought up to support the Lancastrian cause. He was attainted after Buckingham's rebellion in 1483, and restored in 1485. He was knighted in June 1487 after the battle of Stoke. He was a country gentleman of standing who was one of the greatest landowners in his native county of Somerset. His influence in Somerset was confirmed by his active role in county government, and underpinned by his procurement of important offices in the gift of the crown and by his service to the church. He was married twice: to Margaret, daughter of John Paulet of Basing in Hampshire, and, after 1504, to Laura, daughter of William Keilway of Rockborne, Hampshire. He had four children, all from his second marriage: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21619/', "Sir Hugh Paulet")</script>, who succeeded him, Sir John Paulet, Henry, and a daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Paulet was given his first formal appointment in local government in 1485 when for the first of three occasions he was appointed sheriff for Somerset and Dorset. The following year he was appointed JP for Somerset and thereafter, until the mid-1510s, he was regularly placed on the Somerset commission of the peace, and was briefly also JP for Devon. In 1497, he was appointed to collect fines from men and women in the west country implicated in the Perkin Warbeck rebellion against Henry VII. In 1493 he secured the highly influential post of steward of the estates of the bishop of Bath and Wells. In 1501 he was chosen as one of the gentlemen to meet Katherine of Aragon at Crewkerne as she travelled from Plymouth on her way to her marriage with Prince Arthur in London. In 1504 he was appointed by the crown as steward of the duchy manors of Stoke-sub-Hamdon and Curry Malet in Somerset. He was initially excluded from the general pardon of April 1509, perhaps as a result of debt to the crown, but was duly pardoned by Henry VIII in August. In 1513 he took part in Henry's campaign against France, commanding twenty-five men. At about this time he was called to the bar and entered the Middle Temple. He was appointed treasurer of the Middle Temple in 1520 and 1521.<br>
<br>From about 1514 Paulet's involvement in the government of his county declined. He was removed from the commission of the peace for Somerset and was not again appointed to a local commission until 1523&#150;4, when he was appointed to collect the subsidy in Somerset and Bath. Perhaps Paulet was now out of favour. George Cavendish, gentleman usher to Thomas Wolsey, notes in his biography of the cardinal that during his first period of office as sheriff Paulet ordered a then young Thomas Wolsey to be placed in the stocks in Limington, Somerset, as punishment for disorderly conduct at a local fair. Then, with his career much advanced and in a position of power, Wolsey took his revenge on the Somerset man by accusing Paulet of encouraging heretical teaching in the Middle Temple and by confining him to live in London for five or six years. Cavendish continues that it was only by placing Wolsey's badges prominently over the door of a new gateway built in the Middle Temple that Paulet sufficiently appeased the king's minister to be allowed to return home.<br>
<br>Paulet died on 1 April 1538 at Hinton St George, and was buried there.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_21620"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Paulet</span>  (1453/4&#150;1525), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the brother-in-law of Amias Paulet. He was possibly the son of John Paulet of Nunney, Somerset, and Eleanor, daughter of Robert Roos of Gedney and Irton, Lincolnshire. He married Alice, daughter of Sir William Paulet of Hinton St George, and sister of Sir Amias Paulet. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21622/', "William Paulet, first marquess of Winchester")</script>, was John's son. John Paulet was a commander at the battle of Blackheath in 1497 and was made KB at the marriage of Prince Arthur to Katherine of Aragon in November 1501. He died on 5 January 1525.<br>
