<span class="headword">Winstanley,  Denys Arthur</span>  (1877&#150;1947), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 5 December 1877 at 31 Woburn Square, London, the son of Howard Winstanley, auctioneer, and his wife, Katharine Skilbeck. Educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a sub-sizar in 1897. He graduated with first-class honours in history in 1899 and 1900, and in 1901 he was Lightfoot scholar. From 1903 to 1906 he was an assistant school inspector in Durham, but he did not like either his tasks or the place. Characteristically informing the Board of Education that he was leaving their service to take up educational work, he returned to Trinity as a fellow and college lecturer in 1906.<br>
<br>For the rest of his life Winstanley lived in Trinity, with an interval in the First World War in military intelligence in Egypt. He did not marry. Nurturing the collegiate community was habitual. He would take long brisk walks with undergraduate friends. Although a high-church Anglican, he did not allow differences to affect friendship; nor did he &#145;readily tolerate blatancy or self-assertion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 21 March 1947). In 1919 he became a tutor, and between 1925 and 1931 he was senior tutor. From 1935 onwards he served as vice-master, a burden he carried brilliantly during the declining years of Sir Joseph John Thomson, master until 1940. His firmness of decision fitted him for administration, and his imagination and moral power enabled him to respond nobly to events in the Second World War; his speech bidding farewell to officer-students, given on the day in June 1940 that Paris fell, was thought by one obituarist to be perhaps his best  (Duff, 33&#150;5).<br>
<br>In teaching or counselling pupils Winstanley &#145;combined great efficiency with extraordinary charm and sympathy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>), while his delight in the human comedy and talent for epigrammatic summary made history enticing. Certain lectures were dramatic set pieces. &#145;Who sent Charles Yorke to the levee on that morning of January 17th, 1770?&#146; he would ask in stentorian tones, as he concluded one such performance with the sudden and mysterious death of the lord chancellor: &#145;with that question I shall go on next time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Trinity Magazine</span>, March 1922, 44&#150;5).<br>
<br>Winstanley always had a taste for the light-hearted. In his early thirties two comic melodramas by him, <span class="italic">Fellow or Felon?</span> and <span class="italic">The Shame of the Shelfords</span>, were performed in the theatre of the amateur dramatic club at Cambridge. He would entertain undergraduates on many evenings in his college rooms, just as during the Second World War he made welcome young American and Canadian officers briefly accommodated in college. Winstanley &#145;kept the ball of conversation moving with skill&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and in his frequent tall stories he would &#145;desert the Way of Truth for the paths of Wit and Fancy&#146;: telling of a missionary who made only one convert in seven years, whom he then shot, mistaking him for a baboon  (Duff, 33&#150;5). But at 10 p.m. the party dispersed, for he kept to a strict regime to protect his life as an unremitting scholar.<br>
<br>Winstanley started his day at 4.30 a.m. His first two books, published before the First World War, concern British eighteenth-century history, and though now superseded they retain interest because of what was then their novel emphasis on the importance of patronage and family connection, and so remind readers of the work of L. B. Namier a generation later. During the quarter century before his death Winstanley wrote four volumes on the history of Cambridge University, from about 1750 to the new statutes of 1882. His approach changed halfway through the quartet. The delight in human character and oddity, so displayed in his earlier writing and Winstanley's life elsewhere, dwindles to occasional aphorisms in the two long Victorian volumes: it is replaced by a detailed account of the process of constitutional change, as charted in flysheet and statute. Though the complex story is often interpreted from the standpoint of Trinity, it is told with authority and faultless accuracy, which guarantee the lasting value of these four works. On the other hand, even in its day the chronicle seemed incomplete because of its almost total neglect of Cambridge's intellectual life in teaching and scholarship, a surprising gap in view of Winstanley's contribution to this essential function of the university.<br>
<br>Winstanley was lively and active until a few years before his death, but after an operation late in 1945 he did not truly recover. He died in Trinity College on 20 March 1947; there was a service in the chapel of Trinity College, and he was buried in the cemetery of St Giles's Church on 24 March.<br>
