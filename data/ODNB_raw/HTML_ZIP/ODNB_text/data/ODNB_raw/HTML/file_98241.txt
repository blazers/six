<span class="headword">O'Connor,  Francisco Burdett</span>  (1791&#150;1871), <span class="occ">army officer in the Bolivian service</span>, was born at Connorville, Bandon, co. Cork, on 12 June 1791, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20523/', "Roger O'Connor (1762&#150;1834)")</script>, landowner and Irish nationalist, and his second wife, Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline Bowen (<i>d</i>. 1808). The Chartist leader <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20515/', "Feargus O'Connor")</script> was his younger brother; Roderic O'Connor (1784&#150;1860), a landowner and government commissioner in Van Diemen's Land, was a half-brother from his father's previous marriage. Christened William but soon renamed Francis after his godfather, the reformer Sir Francis Burdett, O'Connor was called Frank by his family.<br>
<br>O'Connor's memoirs open with an account of a happy childhood in rural Ireland, with much attention devoted to fox-hunting, which sport must have contributed to his later prowess as a cavalry commander. However, the comforts of a large and wealthy family were rudely disturbed by the adhesion of his uncle Arthur O'Connor to the United Irishmen, and by the far less disciplined journalistic activities of his father Roger in the same cause. Rupturing a conservative clan that had acquired its estates from a fortune made in the London wine trade, O'Connor's uncle and father were jailed in 1798, narrowly escaping execution for treason. Released in 1802, Arthur went into exile in France while the increasingly unreliable Roger frittered away his brother's inheritance&#151;the subject of a number of suits&#151;as well as being associated with two infamous robberies. As a result Frank, Feargus, and their older brother Roderic came to rely heavily on Burdett, who was more able to support them financially once married to Sophia Coutts of the banking family, and who maintained the influence of constitutionalist ideas. In later life O'Connor occasionally made reference to Burdett and his uncle, but he rarely invoked his father. Among the several charges popularly laid against Roger was the burning down of his home, Dangan Castle (bought from the Wellesley family), in an insurance fraud. And yet his son's memoirs allow for the possibility that the conflagration, which hastened the death of Wilhelmina O'Connor, was begun by the boy himself, who spilled some lead with which he was casting bullets for his pistols.<br>
<br>Educated at various grammar and military schools, Frank O'Connor was by 1819 estranged from his father, thoroughly opposed to British control of Ireland, and without a ready local outlet for his military training. In July 1819 he embarked on the <i>Hannah</i> for Venezuela with 200 other Irish volunteers to join the faltering independence campaign against Spain. The next seven years were spent attached to the armies led by Bol&iacute;var and Sucre. First a regimental commander in Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var's Venezuelan campaign against the Spanish crown, early in 1824 O'Connor became chief of staff of the united patriot army in Ecuador and Peru, planning the operations at the victory of Jun&iacute;n (August 1824). After the battle of Ayacucho (December 1824) he was charged by the new patriot commander, General Antonio Jos&eacute; de Sucre, to secure the surrender of the remaining Spanish troops on the South American mainland. This he duly achieved, having suffered a severe wound by lance, at Tupiza in April 1825.<br>
<br>Although there were some prolonged periods of reorganization and training&#151;most notably in Panama, where O'Connor was for several months the senior soldier in the cause of independence&#151;the campaign was exceptionally demanding and dangerous; very few volunteers survived in its service until the end. O'Connor himself probably spent a total of twenty-four hours in direct combat and some three weeks within an hour's ride of the enemy, suffering&#151;as did most lancers&#151;from &#145;lumbago&#146; as well as a variety of largely malarial diseases, to which he developed erratic resistance and for which he improvised treatments, sometimes combining chocolate and celery infusions, sometimes Jalapa peppers with calomel and honey, but mostly relying upon opiate-based &#145;Dover salts&#146;. Never as heavy a drinker or verbose a talker as his comrades, he experimented with increasing expertise in carpentry and as a farrier, kept his diary in good repair, and quite regularly drew down from Burdett's bills in order to clothe and support his men. Yet, a child of a rural oligarchy as well as of the Enlightenment, O'Connor refused to saddle his own horse and would always stand on ceremony in matters of protocol. As a result of the latter, Sucre declined to promote him general during the independence campaign, despite his recognized skill at Jun&iacute;n, a cavalry battle in which not a single cannon shot was fired.<br>
<br>In 1826 O'Connor was formally declared a &#145;liberator&#146; of Bolivia alongside Bol&iacute;var and Sucre, but he never wore this insignia nor any other medal, dedicated his 5000 peso reward to the country's new engineering school, and retired from the army, returning only when Bolivia was under attack from its neighbours. The only man to serve three times as chief of staff of the Bolivian armed forces (1826&#150;7; 1835; 1838), General O'Connor played a prominent part in the battle of Socobaya (February 1836), against Peru, and that of Montenegro (June 1838), against Argentina, thereby preserving the frontiers and sovereignty of the republic.<br>
<br>Early in the republic O'Connor tried to found New Erin, an agricultural colony in Tarija for Irish exiles, along lines similar to his brother's Chartist land company. The settlement, which he proclaimed in an address to the &#145;People of Ireland&#146; (June 1827), never took off, and his subsequent political activity was limited to critiques of English free trade and ardent support for protectionism. For most of the forty-five years after his formal retirement from the army he lived as a gentleman farmer under an ethos of Spartan sufficiency. His estates ranged from the banks of the Pilcomayo towards the Chaco Boreal, through San Luis (now Entre Rios), where he held his largest farms and a salt mine, to Santa Ana, where he tended extensive vines close to the provincial capital. His marriage, on 3 May 1827, to Francisca Ruyloba (<i>b</i>. 1809) resulted from her nursing him when badly wounded and mentally distraught (when lanced, he had tried to shoot himself but his weapon failed to discharge). Of their seven children, only Hercilia survived beyond infancy. She married Adhemar d'Arlach, an employee of the French mission who himself died young, so that the elderly O'Connor was effectively obliged to bring up his grandson Tom&aacute;s as a son&#151;a duty that was recognized by Tom&aacute;s retaining the combined patronymic of O'Connor d'Arlach, still a surname in southern Bolivia.<br>
<br>O'Connor became a distinguished figure in the small &eacute;lite of the southern Bolivian province of Tarija, where he died on 5 October 1871, and was buried in the Tarija cemetery. In his will, drafted in 1866, he admitted to the loss of the telescope that had been a gift from Bol&iacute;var, but he died a wealthy man as well as a practising Catholic. Once he had joined the struggle for Spanish American independence in 1819, he was almost universally known as Francisco Burdett O'Connor, but with the Spanish patronymic unusually assigned to the second surname. In his final will he retained that nomenclature and expressly identified Burdett as his godfather.<br>
<br>In Britain O'Connor's reputation has never matched those of his brother Feargus, his uncle Arthur, or even that of his father Roger. Yet Francisco, a soldier&#150;farmer, did as much as any of his family to promote Enlightenment values and political radicalism in the modern world. His diary was published by Tom&aacute;s in 1895, but the years after 1839 remain in manuscript form, as do the essays on political economy. Two photographic portraits remain and have served for the iconographic basis for O'Connor's memorialization in the province named after him. His gravestone has been lost, but the house he built for Francisca in the 1830s remains, along with decor and furniture dating from his residence there.<br>
