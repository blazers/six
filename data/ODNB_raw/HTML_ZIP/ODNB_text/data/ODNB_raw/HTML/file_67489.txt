<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Knight,  (Charles Henry) Maxwell</span>  (1900&#150;1968), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and naturalist</span>, was born on 9 July 1900 at 199 Selhurst Road, South Norwood, Croydon, one of at least two sons of Hugh Coleraine Knight (<i>d</i>. 1914), a solicitor, and his wife, Ada Phyllis Roberts, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Handcock (<i>d</i>. 1925). His philandering father managed to bankrupt his legal practice. At fourteen Knight was sent to HMS <i>Worcester</i> (the Thames Nautical Training College), off Greenhithe, Kent, to be trained as an officer for the merchant navy. After the death of an older brother on the western front in 1916, Knight volunteered for the Royal Navy and served on armed merchantmen. After the war he briefly worked at the Ministry of Shipping, before taking a post as a teacher of Latin at a minor preparatory school in Putney. On 29 December 1925 he married Gwladys Evelyn Amy (<i>d</i>. 1934), daughter of Charles Edward Hamilton Poole, a military officer.<br>
<br>Knight was personally recruited for MI5 by Vernon Kell, the director-general, in 1925. Kell saw in Knight someone with a perfect cover: a young gentleman about town, much in demand for d&eacute;butante parties, whose new career did not interfere with his enthusiasm for the cellar clubs of Soho and Leicester Square, or his enthusiasm for American jazz and new dances like the Charleston.<br>
<br>At MI5, Knight worked with Guy Liddell in B division, charged with the surveillance of extremists of the right and left. Once trained Knight was given the plum job of recruiting and running individual agents. An apartment at 308 Hood House, Dolphin Square, was rented. As Captain King or Mr K. he was able, perhaps even obliged, to maintain a lively social life as professional cover. He spent the early 1930s dining out with journalists, secretaries, and d&eacute;butantes. At weekends he joined his wife at the Exmoor pub and hotel which she ran, and where the fishing was splendid. Gwladys died on 17 November 1934, and on 28 August 1937 Knight married Lois Mary, a secretary, daughter of William Drave Coplestone; this marriage was ended by divorce in 1943.<br>
<br>Penetration of the headquarters of the Communist Party of Great Britain at King Street had long been an MI5 priority. Knight had the phones tapped and party members working in industry were secretly vetted. Knight recruited agents including Olga Gray, who at nineteen volunteered for office duties with the anti-war movement. Gray's dedication and efficiency won the confidence of the Communist Party leaders at King Street and she was given greater responsibilities, culminating in a request that she set up a safe house for the use of a spy ring operating at the Woolwich arsenal. It was as Miss X that she testified at the trial which sent Percy Glading to prison for six years for espionage. The smashing of the Woolwich arsenal spy ring was a triumph of MI5 methodology, and of Knight's patience.<br>
<br>Knight's agents included Tom Driberg, who was writing the William Hickey column for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. Driberg gave Knight access to the &#145;Caf&eacute; Communists&#146;, whose public school education and experience at Oxford or Cambridge provided them with superb cover for espionage. Knight recruited Bill Younger, stepson of his friends Dennis and Joan Wheatley, to spy on Oxford undergraduates. Known Nazi sympathizers, such as William Joyce, were also used as informants. Knight seems to have preferred attractive young women of respectable backgrounds for the task of penetrating the inner circle of Britain's domestic Nazis.<br>
<br>Knight's greatest success against Nazi espionage came in 1940 with the arrest of Tyler Kent, cipher clerk in the American embassy in London. Kent had made contact with Anna Wolkoff, a member of the Right Club, and gave her copies of the telegrams between Churchill and Roosevelt, which were passed to the Italian embassy. Used with some cleverness, the compromising plans for Lend-Lease could have discredited Roosevelt and possibly driven Churchill from office. With the agreement of the American ambassador, Kent was tried in camera and sentenced to seven years in prison. Wolkoff was given ten years.<br>
<br>In May 1940, five days after the arrest of Tyler Kent, Max Knight's patron, Vernon Kell, was sacked by Churchill. Knight was never again as secure in MI5, and his handling of the case of Ben Greene JP had nearly disastrous consequences for Knight's career. Greene, a cousin of the novelist Graham Greene, was interned after being falsely accused by one of Knight's agents, Harold Kurtz, who had forged letters implicating Greene and had lied about them in court. A member of the Peace Pledge Union and founding member of the British People's Party, Greene was a pacifist who opposed war with Germany. Greene was eventually released. The case weakened confidence in Knight's judgement.<br>
<br>Knight became obsessed with the suspicion that communists had penetrated MI5. After Driberg was expelled from the Communist Party in 1941, Knight suspected that someone in MI5 had passed on information about him to Harry Pollitt. Anthony Blunt was questioned by MI5 about his role in the betrayal of Driberg. In 1941 Knight asked Roger Hollis and Guy Liddell to investigate Soviet penetration of the security services, and sent a secret report, &#145;The Comintern is not dead&#146;, to his friend Desmond Morton, who was Churchill's private secretary. None of those who read the report was persuaded by the evidence Knight had amassed.<br>
<br>With the appointment of Sir Percy Sillitoe as director-general of MI5 in 1946 Knight's position was further weakened. Dolphin Square was closed, and Knight felt himself unheeded and bypassed. The running of agents was largely left to his deputy, John Bingham, whose career as a novelist was just beginning. David Cornwell (later the writer John le Carr&eacute;) was regarded as one of Knight's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s in the early 1950s.<br>
<br>On 18 November 1944 Knight married for the third time. His wife, Susan Mary Durell (<i>d</i>. 1983), daughter of Henry Durell Barnes, worked in MI5's registry during the war. In 1945 he made the first of many naturalist talks for the BBC, and become a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Field</span> and <span class="italic">Country Life</span>. The defections of Maclean and Burgess in May 1951 were followed by the replacement of Sillitoe by Dick White as head of MI5. Guy Liddell was shunted off to the Atomic Energy Authority. But it was too late for Knight to reconstruct his career and he retired from MI5 in 1956. He was appointed OBE.<br>
<br>Knight had written two thrillers in the 1930s, <span class="italic">Crime Cargo</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Gunmen's Holiday</span> (1935), attempting without success to recreate in Britain the American hard-boiled novel. He also wrote several books on natural history for young readers: <span class="italic">The Young Naturalist's Field Guide</span> (1952), and the posthumously published <span class="italic">Pets and their Problems</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Be a Nature Detective</span> (1969).<br>
<br>Maxwell Knight died on 24 January 1968 at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, following a heart attack. At his memorial service he was remembered as Uncle Max, the genial naturalist of the wireless and early days of television. By the 1980s Knight's hidden career was finally revealed: in the inter-war years he had been the MI5 agent-runner who had penetrated espionage operations on both the right and left. Knight was an eccentric and an amateur naturalist; his conduct as head of counter-espionage was professional and exemplary.<br>
