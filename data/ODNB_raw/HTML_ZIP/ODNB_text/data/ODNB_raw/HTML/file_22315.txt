<span class="headword">Pitcairn,  David</span>  (1749&#150;1809), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born on 1 May 1749 in Fife, was the eldest son of Elizabeth Dalrymple and her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53715/', "Major John Pitcairn (bap. 1722, d. 1775)")</script>, who was killed at the battle of Bunker Hill. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22317/', "Robert Pitcairn (1752&#150;1770?)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53715/', "Pitcairn, John (bap. 1722, d. 1775)")</script>], whose name was given to the island he sighted, was his brother. David attended Edinburgh high school, the University of Glasgow, and, some years later, the University of Edinburgh. In 1773 he went to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1779 and MD in 1784. In 1779 he began to practise in London, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 15 August 1785. He was censor five times, and in 1786 was also Goulstonian lecturer and Harveian orator. His uncle, William Pitcairn, resigned the post of physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital, and David was elected in his place on 10 February 1780. He remained in the post until 1793, when he also resigned.<br>
<br>David Pitcairn rapidly built up a large private practice. John Latham mentions him in his treatise on gout and rheumatism, stating that Pitcairn was the first to discover that rheumatic fever frequently caused valvular disease of the heart; and that he announced this discovery while teaching at St Bartholomew's Hospital. On 11 April 1782 Pitcairn was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was married to Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/417/', "William Almack")</script>, founder of the assembly rooms which bore his name, and his wife, Elizabeth, who was sister of William Cullen.<br>
<br>Pitcairn had frequent attacks of quinsy, and in 1798 his failing health, accompanied by haemoptysis, forced him to give up work and spend eighteen months in Portugal. He returned to England and continued to practise, but on 13 April 1809 he had a severe sore throat, followed by acute inflammation of the larynx, causing oedema of the glottis. He died of this on 17 April 1809, at Craig's Court, Charing Cross, London. Matthew Baillie, who had been a close friend of Pitcairn's for thirty years, attended him, and described his case, along with that of Sir John Macnamara Hayes, who died of the same disease three months later. Pitcairn's body was examined by Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie the elder, in the presence of Matthew Baillie, Everard Home, and W. C. Wells. Pitcairn was buried in the family vault at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Less, outside the walls of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. A tablet to his memory was erected in the church of Hadham Magna, Hertfordshire. Pitcairn was known as the fifth possessor of a gold-headed cane which passed from his uncle, William Pitcairn, to him, and then to Matthew Baillie. Baillie's widow gave the cane to the Royal College of Physicians.<br>
