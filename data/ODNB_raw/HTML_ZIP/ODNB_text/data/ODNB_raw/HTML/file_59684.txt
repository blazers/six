<span class="headword">Campbell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elvery]</span>,  Beatrice Moss</span>, Lady Glenavy <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Beatrice Glenavy]</span>  (1883&#150;1970), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born in the suburbs of Dublin, the second of the seven children of (John) William Elvery, merchant, and Mary Teresa Moss (<i>d</i>. 1925), sculptor and music teacher. Her mother was the youngest of seven surviving children, out of fourteen, of Dr William Moss of Kilternan, co. Dublin, and Teresa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Richardson, of Kilgobbin, in the same county. Beatrice was the niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38949/', "Phoebe Traquair (1852&#150;1936)")</script>, a versatile artist of the Edinburgh arts and crafts movement. Clever, enquiring, strong-willed, and dramatically attractive, with a mane of red hair that inspired her fellow artists, she inherited the artistic talents of her mother's family from an early age. Music, literature, and nature study also featured prominently in a happy, companionable, and imaginative childhood. Early examples of her precocious talent for modelling can be seen in romantically illustrative pokerwork panels (1902&#150;3), small clay figures, and plaster-relief panels of mothers with children or babies and other allegorical subjects. Those few cast in bronze included a lectern angel (1904), with carved wooden embellishments by her mother, in their local church, Tullow, Carrickmines, and sporting trophies cast by the Dublin silversmiths West &amp; Co. Her talents were soon recognized at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art (at which she later tutored), where she studied from the age of thirteen, between 1896 and 1905, and won the first studentship for modelling, under the distinguished sculptor John Hughes, as well as scholarships and prizes that took her to the National Art Training School, South Kensington (Edouard Lanteri's classes), and to the Acad&eacute;mie Colarossi, Paris. Her sculpture, which won the annual Taylor competition at the Royal Dublin Society between 1900 and 1908, was singled out at the 1904 Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland exhibition in Dublin. With that society she also exhibited graphic illustrations printed by Elizabeth Yeats's Cuala Press, and stained-glass panels made at Sarah Purser's co-operative workshop, An T&uacute;r Gloine (The Tower of Glass), in Dublin. Between 1904 and 1911, as a member of this studio, she designed and made twenty-six remarkably fine, original windows in a fundamentally English arts and crafts idiom for churches all over Ireland, primarily to support her modest income from painting, drawing, illustrating, and teaching.<br>
<br>Despite her instinctive skill in working imaginatively in this medium and her central role in Dublin's lively artistic, musical, and literary circles during the peak of the cultural renaissance, by 1910 Beatrice Elvery wanted to pursue her success as a painter with, for example, the Young Irish Artists. She left for London to study with Henry Tonks at the Slade School of Fine Art, and two years later, in August 1912, married Gordon Campbell (1885&#150;1963), a barrister actively involved in politics, theatre, and literature, and the son of the Irish lord chancellor. In London their many literary and artistic friends included Mark Gertler, D. H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, and George Bernard Shaw. Beatrice returned to Ireland as often as possible throughout the First World War and continued to draw book illustrations for Irish publications. In 1918, despite her husband's brilliant career at the London bar, they returned to Dublin with two small children at a politically explosive, seminal period in Irish politics. Because of his official position in the free state government they lived under siege in the Dublin outskirts during the civil war, during which most of Beatrice's work was destroyed. Exhilarated by having to start again from scratch, although also out of financial necessity, she began painting furniture, and portraits in a pointillist idiom, as well as continuing to design Cuala Press hand-coloured prints and cards and exhibiting with the Society of Dublin Painters and the Royal Hibernian Academy. She had first shown at the academy in 1902 and continued to do so more or less annually until 1969, being elected a Royal Hibernian academician in 1934. Once her youngest child, born in 1924, was old enough not to need her constant attention she resumed painting in oil and tempera on canvas, bringing her love of the theatre to her fanciful stage-set fantasies of departing sailors and their lasses languishing beneath trees at the water's edge, and Staffordshire china ornaments offset by beribboned flowers and memorabilia in sylvan settings.<br>
<br>Her husband became second Baron Glenavy in 1931. He predeceased her in 1963 and Lady Glenavy died on 21 May 1970 at her home in co. Dublin&#151;Rockall, Ballygihen Avenue, Sandycove&#151;and was buried in Dublin's Mount Jerome cemetery. Paintings by Beatrice, Lady Glenavy, are in the Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin; the Ulster Museum, Belfast; and public galleries in Drogheda, Cork, and Limerick.<br>
