<span class="headword">Edwards,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1808), <span class="occ">bookbinder</span>, was baptized on 6 January 1723 at St James's Church, Halifax, Yorkshire, the second of three sons of Richard Edwards, a schoolmaster.<br>
<br>Edwards was very successful in collecting rare books and his Halifax bookshop and bindery, facing up Old Market, which he founded about 1750, became a mecca for discerning bibliophiles. He refined the old technique of foredge painting by creating exquisite miniatures on the foredges of the pages while the books were carefully supported in a clamp, gilding them afterwards so as to conceal the painting until the pages were gently fanned. He also produced Etruscan calf bindings which usually employed a central &#145;tree pattern&#146; bordered by palmettes, taken from Greek and Etruscan vases, which were lightly burned onto the leather with acid, giving a terracotta effect. He frequently completed this work with an outer border of gold tooling showing either the Greek &#145;key pattern&#146; or his own distinctive marking which consisted of five short vertical bars followed by concentric circles.<br>
<br>Edwards married Jane Green on 4 February 1753. They raised eight children: William (1753&#150;1786), Mary (who became Mrs Alexander), James (<i>b</i>. 1756), John (<i>b</i>. 1758), Sarah (<i>bap</i>. 1761), later Mrs Macauly, Thomas (<i>bap</i>. 1762, <i>d</i>. 1834), Joseph (<i>bap</i>. 1765, <i>d</i>. 1771), and Richard (<i>b</i>. 1768). Jane Edwards died on 24 July 1772.<br>
<br>His growing stock of valuable books prompted Edwards to open a large shop at 102 Pall Mall in 1784 to gain the benefit of the London market. This was run by James and John, who, with Thomas, became famous as binders and dealers in fine books. On 28 January 1785 James took out a patent for a new treatment of vellum, devised by his father, which rendered it transparent by scraping it, soaking it in a solution of pearl ash, and heavily pressing it so that a painting executed on the reverse showed through. James spent much of his time on profitable journeys in Holland and Italy buying valuable libraries, while John concentrated on Paris, where he met his death about 1791. Although there is no evidence, the supposition is that he was seen to be in possession of valuable books and guillotined as an aristocrat.<br>
<br>Thomas continued to work in the Halifax shop which he took over after his father, a devout member of Northgate End Chapel, died, at the shop, 2 Old Market, Halifax, on 10 January 1808, aged eighty-five. William Edwards was buried at Halifax parish church on 17 January 1808.<br>
