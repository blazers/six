<span class="headword">Fletcher, Sir  Lazarus</span>  (1854&#150;1921), <span class="occ">museum director and mineralogist</span>, was born at 11 Williamson Street, Salford, on 3 March 1854, the eldest child of six sons and two daughters of Stewart Fletcher of Salford and his wife, Betty, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gregory. He was educated at Manchester grammar school (1865&#150;72) and gained the gold medal for mechanics and the bronze medal for mathematics, as well as several certificates in other subjects, in the national examinations of the Department of Science and Art at South Kensington Museum in 1872. He won an open science scholarship, the Brackenbury, to Balliol College, Oxford, the same year. He took a distinguished first class in mathematical moderations in 1874 and in the final examinations in both the mathematical (1875) and natural science (1876) schools.<br>
<br>Fletcher was appointed a demonstrator in physics, under Professor R. B. Clifton, at the Clarendon Physical Laboratory (1875&#150;7). He was elected to the Millard lectureship in physics at Trinity College, Oxford (1877&#150;8), and in 1877 he was also elected to a fellowship at University College, Oxford. This last position he had to resign when, on 1 September 1880, at the parish church of Moorside, near Oldham, he married Agnes Ward Holme (<i>d</i>. 1915), the daughter of Thomas Holme, the vicar of Moorside. They had one daughter, Elizabeth Gregory Fletcher.<br>
<br>When at the Clarendon Laboratory, Fletcher read Groth's <span class="italic">Physikalische Krystallographie</span>. Thereafter Clifton drew Fletcher to the attention of Professor Story-Maskelyne, keeper of the mineralogy department at the British Museum. In 1878 Fletcher succeeded W. J. Lewis as assistant in that department. Upon Story-Maskelyne's resignation in 1880 he was promoted to keeper, a position he held until 1909. Shortly after his appointment he had to organize the moving of the collection of minerals and meteorites from Bloomsbury to the new buildings in South Kensington. This was a huge task owing to the vast number of specimens involved, to their value and fragility, and to their having to be completely rearranged. Fletcher also had to design new showcases, and he prepared guides and handbooks to the collections&#151;deemed &#145;masterpieces of lucid and precise exposition&#146;&#151;not to mention some 17,000 labels for objects, printed labels now replacing the manuscript labels of old. Of particular note were his introductions to the study of meteorites (1881), of minerals (1884), and of rocks (1895). He also appointed guide-lecturers, but had difficulty appointing well-qualified assistants. He did, though, establish a well-equipped laboratory. He also travelled abroad, to Russia (to the International Geological Congress) and Sweden in 1897 and to Switzerland and Italy in 1902.<br>
<br>In 1906 Fletcher developed a severe heart-related illness; he was never again fully to regain good health. However, in July 1909 he succeeded Sir Ray Lankester, who retired in December 1907, as director of the British Museum (Natural History). Fletcher had been overlooked as director when Sir W. H. Flower retired in 1898. This was largely through pressure brought about by certain members of the Royal Society, who, in addition to being strongly pro-Lankester, were against both a mineralogist and an internal candidate being promoted to the position, thereby overruling the museum's trustees. Fletcher was still able to carry out scientific research, particularly regarding meteorites and crystallography. Of greatest importance was his investigation of the transmission of light through crystals, published both in the <span class="italic">Mineralogical Magazine</span> (9, 1891, 278&#150;388) and in book form (1892), which revolutionized the teaching of physical optics, bringing him international renown: &#145;This paper alone is sufficient evidence that he possessed unrivalled powers of elucidation and exposition which would have placed him in the front rank of teachers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mineralogical Magazine</span>, 186). In his career Fletcher wrote over forty articles, most being read before the Mineralogical Society before appearing in the <span class="italic">Mineralogical Magazine</span>, as well as numerous contributions to other works. He also wrote the entry on meteorites in <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (11th edn, 1910&#150;11). In 1911 he directed an exhibition on animals, plants, and minerals mentioned in the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, held to commemorate the tercentenary of the Authorized Version, and contributed an essay on biblical minerals, an area of personal interest. Illness often kept Fletcher away from the museum. He did not think too highly of his own tenure of the directorship. To Sir Frederic Kenyon, director of the British Museum, he wrote in 1919: &#145;as for the last ten years, there is nothing to show except the keeping of the peace, and keeping people at peace with each other so far as that is possible&#146;  (Stearn, 111).<br>
<br>Fletcher was an examiner in natural science at the Oxford public examinations in 1880, and for the Cambridge natural science tripos in 1882&#150;3, 1889&#150;91, and 1896&#150;7. He was also a member of the boards of electors of Oxford and Cambridge universities to the professorships of mineralogy. In 1895 and in 1904 he gave a course of lectures on meteorites at the Royal Institution. He was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1879 and served as vice-president (1890&#150;93); he was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1889 and served on its council (1895&#150;7 and 1910&#150;12, for the latter period as a vice-president); and he was president of the Mineralogical Society (1885&#150;8) and its general secretary from 1888 to 1909. His service to this society was rewarded by the presentation of his portrait, subscribed to by members, in 1912. He was also president of the geological section of the British Association at Oxford in 1894, to which he gave a notable address &#145;On the progress of mineralogy and crystallography&#146;. He was a vice-president of the Physical Society (1895&#150;7), and received numerous honours. He was made an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, in 1910, and two years later was awarded the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society. He was a corresponding or honorary member of numerous societies and institutions, both abroad and at home. He also received honorary degrees from the universities of St Andrews (LLD) and Berlin (PhD).<br>
<br>In 1915 Fletcher's wife, for many years an invalid, died. The following year, on 15 August, he married her sister, (Martha Thomasina) Edith Holme, then aged fifty-two, at the parish church of Barnard Castle in co. Durham. He also received a knighthood in 1916. Upon his retirement in 1919 his reduced income necessitated moving from London, and he went to live in Ravenstonedale, a village near Kirkby Stephen, Westmorland. A particular interest was gardening. He also hoped to realize a long-held ambition to write a comprehensive treatise on the classification of minerals, but he did not live long enough. On 6 January 1921, while on a brief holiday in Grange-over-Sands with his family, he died of a heart attack at the Tents Hotel; he had also been suffering from arteriosclerosis and diabetes. He was buried in Ravenstonedale on 11 January.<br>
