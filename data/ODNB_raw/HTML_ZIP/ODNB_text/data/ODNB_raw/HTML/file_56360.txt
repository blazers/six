<span class="headword">Cinquevalli,  Paul</span>  (1859&#150;1918), <span class="occ">juggler</span>, was born at Lissa, in the Posen district of Prussia, on 30 June 1859. Cinquevalli was his stage name and also the name by which he was known. In his will he gives his name at birth as Emile Otto Paul Braun. There is some disagreement over his given name&#151;some authorities give this as Paul Braun-Lehmann and others as Paul Kestner&#151;and also over his father's occupation. Cinquevalli himself referred to him in interviews as a &#145;miller&#146;, although more recent histories of juggling suggest him to have been a &#145;civil servant&#146;. All sources agree, however, that it was his father's &#145;political opinions&#146; that forced the family into exile in Berlin when Paul was only two.<br>
<br>Paul was intended by his parents for the priesthood but seems to have been fascinated from an early age by a much more exciting vocation: that of throwing objects into the air and catching them as they fell. By the time he had reached school age he had mastered the techniques of juggling so well that he &#145;could, after a little practice, throw his pencil and slate in the air, catch the pencil, write the letter A on the slate, and catch the slate before it reached the ground&#146;  (&#145;Cinquevalli&#146;). Although he had found in this trick a brilliant proof of his own literacy it was the nearest he ever came to the priesthood. Indeed he seems to have devoted more school time to perfecting circus skills than to his more formal studies. At the age of thirteen he won a string of prizes for gymnastics and a year later&#151;after, it seems, one argument about his future too many&#151;he ran away with a troupe of Italian acrobats led by one Giuseppe Chiese-Cinquevalli. Chiese-Cinquevalli gave his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; more than just a surname: the high-wire acts that he asked the younger man to perform inadvertently decided his future career.<br>
<br>Young Cinquevalli made his d&eacute;but on the trapeze in Odessa; after a period touring through eastern and central Europe&#151;which included a performance in Berlin before Kaiser Wilhelm I, the enormous success of which reconciled him to his parents &#145;after two years complete separation and silence&#146;  (&#145;Cinquevalli&#146;)&#151;he returned to Russia to begin &#145;a long engagement at the Zoological Gardens of St Petersburg [which] earned him the name of the &#147;Little Flying Devil&#148;&#146;  (Frost). Eventually, however, this proved disastrous: the circus employee who should have dried the trapeze had left his post, to &#145;absorb &#147;moisture&#148; in glasses, at bars more congenial&#146;  (&#145;Cinquevalli&#146;). &#145;As usual&#146; recalled Cinquevalli, &#145;I leapt with outstretched hands, but the trapeze slid through my fingers as if it had been greased&#146;  (ibid.). The fall, of 75 feet, at a time when safety nets were uncommon left him in a hospital bed for eight months.<br>
<br>Cinquevalli's therapy during a period of frustration and intense boredom was to return to the tricks of his childhood: &#145;hour after hour, and day after day, I spent in balancing and juggling bottles, balls, plates, anything and everything I could lay my hands on&#146;  (&#145;Cinquevalli&#146;). This intense period of practice paid handsome dividends: when he next performed with the acrobats it was as a juggler rather than in his former role. His European reputation grew rapidly, and he was soon in demand throughout the United States and the British empire, but it was in Britain that he achieved his greatest and most lasting success. He married Dora Nowell, with whom he had a daughter, Margot.<br>
<br>Cinquevalli's first appearance in London was in 1885 at the Covent Garden Theatre, where, perhaps fortuitously, among the admiring audience was the prince of Wales. Not long afterwards Cinquevalli was invited to give a private performance before the prince and &#145;a brilliant gathering&#146;  (Fitzgerald) at Marlborough House, which included one of his most celebrated small-scale feats:<blockquote>I take a wooden bar eighteen inches long and one inch in diameter, and suspend it by means of two loops of ordinary newspaper from the edges of two razors. My assistant holds the razors and I break the stick with a blow without injuring the paper in the least degree. (&#145;Cinquevalli&#146;)</blockquote>Apparently &#145;The Prince himself was greatly struck with [this trick], and asked [Cinquevalli] to repeat it again and again, in order that he himself might select razors, broom-handle, and striking stick, and also make the paper loops&#146;  (Fitzgerald). Performances such as these ensured that Cinquevalli swiftly moved to the top of many of the best bills, while also becoming synonymous with the proverbial safe pair of hands. As one political commentator opined in 1886 &#145;Had he flourished in the old election days he might have gained a fortune by teaching Parliamentary candidates how to catch rotten eggs on the hustings without breaking them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</span>).<br>
<br>A second accident not long afterwards&#151;caused by performing an awkward lift &#145;when I was performing before the Shah and the Prince and Princess of Wales at the Crystal Palace&#146;  (&#145;A talk with Paul Cinquevalli&#146;)&#151;forced Cinquevalli's temporary retirement and another move to Berlin, where he became proprietor of the Reichshallen-theater. His return to the stage&#151;at the prompting of a doctor who came to treat Cinquevalli's wife and &#145;saw a picture of me in my professional dress&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;was also a return to England. The welcome and the adulation that he received were as great as they had been before his move to Germany, and, in recognition of this, he took a house in Brixton in 1893 and, shortly afterwards, British citizenship.<br>
<br>Cinquevalli's hold over his audiences, as well as over the future King Edward VII, can of course be ascribed to his unusual powers of agility, balance, and strength. However, the public's fascination was much increased by his habit of including &#145;very homely articles&#146;  (Fitzgerald) into his acts to create the additional and more subtle illusion that such impossible feats could be achieved by any man in his own parlour. The most celebrated of all his tricks in particular brought the world of the gentleman's club to the variety stage, as a reporter for <span class="italic">Answers</span> magazine (26 September 1896) discovered:<blockquote>&#145;But this is the trick I must show you,&#146; said [Cinquevalli], pulling on a peculiar-looking green-baize jacket. &#145;Now I am a billiard table. Where are my pockets? Ah!&#146; An attendant tightly fixed five pockets, exactly similar to billiard-table pockets, one on each side of the professor's shoulders, one on each hip, and one in the middle of his back. &#145;My sixth pocket; where is my sixth pocket? Yes, it is my ear; my right ear is the sixth pocket. My forehead is &#147;spot&#148;&#146;, said the professor, placing the red ball on his brow. &#145;What shot shall I make you? I will make a &#147;break&#148;, five&#151;six&#151;ten, what you will. Ten? All right.&#146; &hellip; to make the ten &#145;shot&#146;, he placed a wineglass, containing a ball, in his mouth; then, on top of the ball in the glass, poised the cue. On top of the cue were balanced a white and a red ball. He threw a fourth ball at them, making a &#145;cannon&#146; off the red, and, while all four balls were in the air, jumped suddenly round, caught the wineglass in the left-hip pocket, a ball in the right, another ball in the shoulder pocket, and the two remaining balls both went into the pocket fastened to his back. (&#145;A chat with a human billiard table&#146;)</blockquote>Extraordinary feats such as these led to invitations from other areas of theatre; in winter 1896&#150;7 Cinquevalli performed &#145;amazing feats with blazing torches&#146;  (&#145;Boxing day entertainments&#146;) as the Slave of the Lamp in the Drury Lane pantomime <span class="italic">Aladdin</span>, opposite Ada Blanche (in the title role) and Dan Leno's Mrs Twankey. Over the next fifteen years his career as a top-of-the-bill variety artist prospered; in 1912, in one of his final appearances, he repeated the &#145;human billiard table&#146; trick at the Palace Theatre, Cambridge Circus, as part of the first royal variety performance. He retired from the stage in June of that year, after a final performance at the Winter Gardens in New Brighton.<br>
<br>Cinquevalli was then only in his fifties&#151;still relatively young for a variety artist even in his particularly demanding line&#151;and his decision seems to have been prompted at least in part by the political situation in Europe; with the First World War rapidly approaching he was already feeling the effects of anti-German sentiment. It had been &#145;discovered&#146; in the popular press that he had been born with a Teutonic surname and was therefore potentially an enemy subversive. Although publicly acknowledging the name he was at pains to show that his family were Polish, his training Russian, and his sympathies entirely British. This argument seems, however, to have been rather too subtle for the mob, particularly when the war began in earnest two years later.<br>
<br>First-hand reports of this period in Cinquevalli's life are scarce but his experience has been vividly evoked by a much later imaginative writer; Edwin Morgan's poem from the 1980s &#145;Cinquevalli&#146;, prompted by the chance discovery of a postcard showing the juggler in his leotard, includes this description as the eighth of a series of ten snapshots of his life:<blockquote>
<div>Cinquevalli broods in his armchair in Brixton Road.<br>
</div>
<div>He reads in the paper about the shells whining<br>
</div>
<div>at Passchendaele, imagines the mud and the dead.<br>
</div>
<div>He goes to the window and wonders through that dark evening<br>
</div>
<div>what is happening in Poland where he was born.<br>
</div>
<div>His neighbours call him a German spy.<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;Kestner, Paul Kestner, that's his name!&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>&#145;Keep Kestner out of the British music-hall!&#146;<br>
</div>
<div>He frowns; it is cold; his fingers seem stiff and old.<br>
</div> (Morgan, 114)</blockquote>Cinquevalli died at his home&#151;5 Mostyn Road, Brixton, London&#151;on 14 July 1918, just fifty-nine but apparently only a shadow of the variety-stage strong man that he had been. He was broken in both spirit and body by the constant verbal attacks of a persistent &#145;patriotic&#146; mob, and his death, of heart failure, only a few months before the armistice would seem the consequence of a much more widespread failure of &#145;heart&#146;: his betrayal by the ungrateful country that he had entertained for nearly thirty years and to which he had given, unasked, the gift of his allegiance.<br>
