<span class="headword">Philips,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1703, <em>d.</em> 1747), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was baptized in St Mildred Poultry with St Mary Colechurch, London, on 8 May 1703, the son of Richard Philips (<i>c</i>.1681&#150;1741), a minor painter who probably taught him. In 1731 George Vertue reviewed Philips's work &#145;in painting small figure portraits &amp; conversations [which] has met with great encouragement amongst People of Fashion&#151;even some of y<sup>e</sup> Royal Family&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 3.54). Their na&iuml;ve charm attracted commissions from noble families. His earliest portrait groups date from 1730 and show static figures in untamed landscapes. <span class="italic">Thomas Hill of Tern with his Family</span>, dated 1730 (Attingham Park, Shropshire), shows a groom leading the pony belonging to the eldest son, who stands with a family group posing in a landscape. Another, which recalls the form of William Hogarth's more accomplished <span class="italic">Wanstead Assembly</span> (1730; Philadelphia Museum of Art), shows an assembly at Lord Harrington's house (1730; Yale U. CBA). In the next two or three years Philips's style became more relaxed, and his patrons included Algernon, seventh duke of Somerset (1732; priv. coll.), and the duchess of Portland (1732; priv. coll.), who are both shown with their families in sumptuous baroque interiors. His work is characterized by bright colouring and an uncluttered directness that must partly explain his popularity. As the 1730s progressed his conversation pieces became more elaborate with an increasing number of sitters participating in more varied activities. Perhaps the portrait of John Shales Barrington posing beside a statue of Diana with his Leheup and Lowndes relations on either side is the most complex example (Christies, 8 April 1998, lot 13; priv. coll.). Despite his success in gaining aristocratic commissions, his handling of paint and portrayal of the psychological relationship between his sitters were less sophisticated than those of his Scottish contemporary Gawen Hamilton.<br>
<br>In 1737 the prince and princess of Wales sat to Philips for full-length portraits (former, the Royal Collection; latter, priv. coll.) which recall the work of Jacopo Amigoni. They were probably inspired by more decorative portraits by Philips's contemporary Philip Mercier but appear coarse in comparison. Philips painted a number of life-size portraits of the Wentworth family at the same time. His last portrait, of Thomas Secker, is dated 1740 (diocese of Oxford). His marriage to Mary Francis is probably that recorded in Fleet Street on 21 May 1737. He moved to Great Queen Street, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, soon afterwards, and this change in circumstances may have kept him from painting. Charles Philips died prematurely in London between 20 October and 23 November 1747.<br>
