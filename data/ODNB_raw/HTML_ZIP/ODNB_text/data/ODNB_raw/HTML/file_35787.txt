<span class="headword">Scott,  John William  Robertson</span>  (1866&#150;1962), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 20 April 1866 at Wigton in Cumberland, the second of eight children (the first died in infancy) of David Young Crozier Scott (1844&#150;1887), commercial traveller and temperance orator, and his wife, Janet (1843&#150;1905), daughter of John Robertson. His border origins were wholly rural. He was educated at Quaker and grammar schools. His parents, who held broad and liberal views, welcomed many like-minded visitors of several nationalities to a home that was &#145;serious but not austere, of great affection and care&#146;. Robertson Scott wrote of his father, as one who had much to do in setting the course of his life, that he was &#145;not only a teetotaller and a non-smoker, but a believer in cold baths and a disbeliever in bottles of medicine&#146;. His parents were members of the Evangelical Union, but the family went to Quaker, Wesleyan, and Congregational services &#145;impartially&#146;.<br>
<br>The family moved to Carlisle about 1876 and later to Birmingham, where Robertson Scott's father was summoned to take charge of the organization to which he had devoted already a disproportionate share of his time and energies: the Independent Order of Good Templars. One of Robertson Scott's first jobs was as secretary to Joseph Malins, head of the grand lodge of the Good Templars in England; but he had already decided on a career in journalism. His father died at the age of forty-two, when he was still in his teens. As the eldest surviving son he accepted the challenge and supported his mother, brother, and three sisters on meagre journalistic earnings. In retrospect he was grateful for &#145;a realizing sense of what poverty is&#146;. The first payment had come from C. P. Scott of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, and he was contributing to several national journals when H. J. Palmer offered him a staff appointment on the <span class="italic">Birmingham Gazette</span>; but he had to leave when he stipulated that, as a Liberal, he should write nothing in support of the Conservative cause. He was working again as a freelance when, in 1887, he was invited by W. T. Stead to join him on the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>. He worked for six years on that paper under Stead and then Edward T. Cook. When Cook left to found the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span> in 1893 Robertson Scott accompanied him and wrote a daily feature, &#145;Round the world&#146;. In 1899 he transferred to the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> under H. W. Massingham, but resigned with him in November of that year on the issue of the South African War, with which the proprietors sympathized.<br>
<br>It was then that Robertson Scott decided to live and write in the country. He acquired a cottage at Great Canfield in Essex and &#145;invented that pioneer in rural journalism and authorship, &#147;Home Counties&#148;&#146;. In 1902 he was invited by J. St Loe Strachey to contribute farming articles to the <span class="italic">Country Gentleman</span>. In the next few years, using the same pseudonym, he was closely associated with the <span class="italic">World's Work</span> and <span class="italic">The Field</span>; he also wrote hundreds of articles and several books in a style peculiarly his own. They were for townspeople about farmers and smallholders, farm workers and landowners, how they lived and made a living, omitting the technicalities. He travelled the country and made frequent visits abroad, notably to the Netherlands and Denmark. His energy was prodigious, his journalistic output remarkable. In 1906 he married the talented Elspet (1858&#150;1956), daughter of George Keith, of HM customs. They had no children. Together they contributed to the life of rural Essex, forming at Dunmow the Progressive Club for &#145;men and women of markedly different upbringings and associations, politics, denominations and incomes&#146;, and producing in Lady Warwick's big barn plays by Synge, Barrie, and Bensusan.<br>
<br>When war broke out in 1914 Robertson Scott was above military age. He paid two visits to the Netherlands, then sold his Essex property and went to Japan. Looking ahead to the period of post-war reconstruction, he had in mind two studies: one of the small-farming system and rural life in Japan, the other (never accomplished) of large-scale farming in the American mid-west. While in Japan, gathering material with characteristic penetration and vigour, he started and edited with official backing a monthly, the <span class="italic">New East</span>; he refused to adopt a propagandist approach and tried to explain Japan and the Japanese to the West and Western ideas to the East. In 1916 appeared, in both English and Japanese, his book <span class="italic">Japan, Great Britain and the World</span>; but it was not until 1922, a year after his return home by way of the United States, that his copious notes were published as <span class="italic">The Foundations of Japan</span>, long the standard work in English on the rural life and people of that country.<br>
<br>On his return Robertson Scott resumed his journalistic writing, became an enthusiastic adviser to the National Federation of Women's Institutes (he published, in 1925, <span class="italic">The Story of the Women's Institute Movement</span>), and was a hard-working member of the Liberal land committee which produced <span class="italic">The Land and the Nation</span> (1923&#150;5). At this time he contributed to <span class="italic">The Nation</span> a series of four articles which grew to twenty-four and was published anonymously as <span class="italic">England's Green and Pleasant Land</span> (1925), his best-selling book. It described frankly and penetratingly, through the people and their talk about neighbours and themselves, the life of a contemporary village. <span class="italic">The Dying Peasant and the Future of his Sons</span> followed a year later.<br>
<br>In 1923 Robertson Scott had moved to the Cotswold hamlet of Idbury in Oxfordshire. Four years later, at the age of sixty-one, he founded the quarterly review, <span class="italic">The Countryman</span>. He and his wife were business and advertisement manager, editor, sub-editor, and principal contributors. Ignoring the advice of friends, and with never more than &pound;500 capital, they made it the most successful venture in periodical publishing between the two world wars. Non-party, though firm enough in opinion, it was packed with rural life and character, placing before town, city, and country dwellers vividly and convincingly the facts, and strengthening the forces of rural progress; but to achieve its more serious purpose it needed also to entertain. Robertson Scott sold the magazine in 1943 and continued to edit it with full independence for a further four years.<br>
<br>Despite the demands of <span class="italic">The Countryman</span>, Robertson Scott was active in local government. Housing had been one of his most compelling interests since he contributed to the <span class="italic">Country Gentleman</span> a series of articles entitled &#145;In search of a &pound;150 cottage&#146;; this led to an exhibition at Letchworth opened by the duke of Devonshire. For ten years he chaired his district council housing committee, and served under four ministers of health on the Central Housing Advisory Committee. He became a JP and founded the Quorum Club, an educational society with a good library for magistrates. He set great store by the gatherings of &#145;village neighbours&#146; in Idbury School to hear an invited speaker each Sunday afternoon. In 1947, on his retirement, Robertson Scott was made a Companion of Honour. Two years later he was awarded an honorary MA degree by Oxford University.<br>
<br>A self-styled agnostic, Robertson Scott had an infectious faith in humanity. He envisaged a future where ordinary men and women would grow in stature as their opportunities expanded. All his strivings, tremendous energy, knowledge, and journalistic skill were directed to extending these opportunities. He was always welcoming to people and causes. He was greatly helped by a devoted wife, herself a gifted writer, who provided him with a satisfying home background. He lived until his middle nineties with faculties undiminished, and died at home at Idbury Manor on 21 December 1962.<br>
