<span class="headword">Waterhouse, Sir  Edward</span>  (1535&#150;1591), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was born at Helmstedbury, Hertfordshire, the youngest son of John Waterhouse, administrator, of Whitechurch, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Henry Turner of Blunt's Hall, Suffolk. His father was auditor to Henry VIII, and according to family tradition the king, when visiting him one day, was particularly impressed with Edward, foretelling that he would be a man of great honour and wisdom, fit for the service of princes. Waterhouse went to Oxford University when he was twelve, &#145;where for some years he glistered in the oratorick and poetick sphere, until he addicted himself to conversation and observance of state affairs&#146;.<br>
<br>Waterhouse spent several years at court under the patronage of Sir Henry Sidney. Sidney revived the practice of employing a personal secretary when appointed lord deputy of Ireland in 1565, and chose Waterhouse for the office. This proved an excellent decision and Waterhouse became a mainstay of the Dublin administration. He was devoted to Sidney, who sent him on missions to London, and corresponded regularly with Sir William Cecil and Sir Francis Walsingham. He was made clerk of the castle chamber on 1 February 1566, and about the same time received a grant of a lease of the manor of Evan, co. Kildare, together with the corn tithes of Dunboyne, co. Meath.<br>
<br>In 1568 Waterhouse accompanied Sidney on his tour of Ireland. The lord deputy left him in charge of Carrickfergus, co. Antrim, and he was instrumental in obtaining a charter for the town in 1570, as a result of which he was created a freeman and nominated to represent it in parliament, which he did in 1585. He surrendered his office of clerk in October 1569, and when Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex, embarked on a scheme for the plantation of co. Antrim in 1573 Waterhouse wrote seeking employment. His self-confident letter did not set out his qualifications for the post, but rather listed the many services he could perform for the earl. Essex employed him as his secretary, sending him on frequent missions to England in connection with the sale of his property and supplying his army with provisions. Waterhouse earned Essex's gratitude by his discretion and devotion. He was present during Essex's last illness, and the earl died in his arms on 22 September 1576.<br>
<br>The failure of Essex's enterprise left Waterhouse unemployed, but he obtained a grant on 25 April 1576 of an annual pension of &pound;182 10<i>s</i>., which was confirmed for life on 26 June 1579. Again, Sidney appointed him as his secretary, and he was sent to England with Philip Sidney to plead the lord deputy's case in 1576&#150;9 over the matter of the cess, including government impositions such as purveyance, levied on the inhabitants of the pale. Waterhouse's first marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of George Villiers, broke down during this time and the couple divorced in 1578. Waterhouse was appointed to the commission to inquire into concealed and forfeited lands in 1578. On 5 February 1579 he obtained a grant of the collectorship of customs on wine in Ireland, on 27 June he was appointed exchequer commissioner of the army, on 7 July receiver-general in the exchequer, and on 25 July receiver of all casual profits falling to the crown. He was present in Munster from August to November, while the army under Sir William Drury was there, and during the rebellion of James fitz Maurice Fitzgerald and Sir John Desmond, adding to his other duties that of overseeing victualling. At the end of October he was sworn of the Irish privy council. The outbreak of the rebellion of Gerald fitz James Fitzgerald, fourteenth earl of Desmond, in November saw Waterhouse recalled to his post with the army in Munster, and for the next two years his time was fully taken up as secretary, exchequer commissioner, and overseer of the commissariat. On 17 June 1580 he obtained a grant of the office of overseer and water bailiff of the River Shannon, with valuable perquisites. He was appointed a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes on 10 April 1581, and on 22 July was granted a lease for twenty-one years of the lands of Hilltown, co. Meath. Waterhouse served the lord deputies Arthur Grey, fourteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, and Sir John Perrot with the same faithfulness that he had shown towards Essex and Sidney, seemed to have no enemies, and everyone who came in contact with him had a good word to say of him. Despite his &#145;weak body&#146;, he fulfilled his numerous duties assiduously. He obtained a grant of the castle and lands of Doonass, co. Clare, on 26 August, to be held in fealty, by the service of providing the lord deputy with a pair of gloves whenever he visited the castle. He had by this time accumulated numerous perquisites, and while they may not have amounted to a large income, they aroused Elizabeth I's jealousy, especially over the positions of water bailiff and custodian of the boats at Athlone, co. Westmeath. He was ordered over to England in the autumn. Waterhouse's modest behaviour and the warm commendations he brought from Ireland won over Cecil (now Lord Burghley), and his offer to surrender his patent of water bailiff mollified the queen, although she insisted on having a list made out of all patents, fees, and other perquisites granted to him during the previous seven years.<br>
<br>Waterhouse returned to Ireland in April 1583. In March 1584 he was required, along with Sir Geoffrey Fenton, to carry out, according to Burghley's instructions, the unpleasant task of torturing Dermot O'Hurley, titular archbishop of Cashel, by toasting his feet before the fire. Waterhouse was knighted by Perrot in Christ Church, Dublin, on 20 June 1584, the lord deputy giving the reason for the promotion as the fact that Waterhouse spent more than 1000 marks a year in carrying out his duties. While Perrot's expedition against the Antrim Scots was greeted with general disapproval, Waterhouse spoke out in his favour. He had already given up his office of secretary to please Fenton; in November he surrendered his patent as water bailiff, and, shortly afterwards, in order to gratify Sir Henry Wallop, relinquished his receivership of casualties. He acted as peacemaker in the quarrel between Perrot and Adam Loftus, archbishop of Dublin, without forfeiting the respect of either. Perrot granted Waterhouse leave, &#145;having been long sick and in great danger&#146;, to go to England to plead his own case, and he urged Burghley to intercede for the restoration of his patent as water bailiff, as some reward for his long and faithful service. Waterhouse presented a detailed account of all his offices and rewards, and explained that, far from profiting by them, he had been obliged to sell land in England worth over &pound;4000. He evidently persuaded Elizabeth, since on 19 October 1586 he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer and of the green wax in Ireland. The green wax was a legal process for recovering debts due to the crown for which the chancellor was responsible. He surrendered the office to George Clive in October 1589, having by that time received a grant (7 July 1588), in consideration &#145;of his sufficiency and painful good service&#146;, of the office of overseer, water bailiff, and keeper of the River Shannon for life  (<span class="italic">Irish Fiants</span>, nos. 3641, 5231&#150;2). He left Ireland in January 1591, retired to his estate of Woodchurch, Kent, and died there on 13 October. His second wife was Margaret Spilman of Kent. His last wife, who survived him, was Deborah, widow of a Master Harlackenden of Woodchurch. He had no children. <a href="#cosubject_28811">Edward Waterhouse [<i>see below</i>]</a> was probably his nephew. The heraldic writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28812/', "Edward Waterhouse (1619&#150;1670)")</script> was his grandnephew.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28811"></a><span class="headword">Edward Waterhouse</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1622), <span class="occ">colonist in Virginia</span>, was the son of Thomas Waterhouse of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. He was secretary of the Virginia Company and author of <span class="italic">A declaration of the state of the colony in Virginia. With a relation of the barbarous massacre &hellip;</span> (1622), with a preface dated 22 August 1622. Waterhouse was the principal spokesman for the colonists after the American Indian insurrection of spring 1622. It is clear that the colonists felt that this violent resistance by the native population liberated them from the constraints of their original moral justification for their occupation, that of &#145;civilizing&#146; the indigenous population, a change of attitude that had its parallel in Ireland when Sir Edward Waterhouse served Essex in Ulster at the time of the massacre of the Clandeboye O'Neills.<br>
