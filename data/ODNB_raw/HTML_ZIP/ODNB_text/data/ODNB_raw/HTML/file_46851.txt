<span class="headword">Crawshay,  George</span>  (1821&#150;1896), <span class="occ">ironmaster and politician</span>, was born on 5 February 1821 in Russell Square, London, the eldest son of George Crawshay (1794&#150;1873), iron merchant, of Stoke Newington, and his wife, Josephe Louise Dufaud (1802&#150;1883) from Paris. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47475/', "William Crawshay (1764&#150;1834)")</script>, the &#145;Iron King&#146; of south Wales, from whom he inherited both wealth and entrepreneurial skill. His mother's family owned the largest ironworks in France at Fourchambault. He studied classics at Trinity College, Cambridge, 1839&#150;42, and although he never graduated (possibly because he may have been a dissenter), he subsequently read for the bar at the Inner Temple. However, in 1843 the sudden death of his brother-in-law Francis William Stanley disrupted his promising legal career.<br>
<br>Crawshay and his younger brother Edmund were obliged to take over the management of Hawks, Stanley &amp; Co., an established ironworks at Gateshead on the Tyne previously run by members of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47498/', "Hawks family (per. c.1750&#150;1863)")</script>. The senior partner, George Hawks, retired soon afterwards and the rapid expansion that followed can be largely attributed to the Crawshays' expertise in securing government contracts. By the mid-1840s the ironworks of Hawks, Crawshay &amp; Sons had become the largest on Tyneside, employing more than one thousand workers. It produced a vast range of iron goods, including anchors, chains, and boiler plates, but its growing reputation primarily accrued from lucrative contracts to supply quality ironwork for bridges and lighthouses. Among the most notable of these was the commission for Newcastle upon Tyne's High Level Bridge in 1849, an ambitious structure requiring some 5050 tons of ironwork. The firm also worked on the Iron Bridge at Sunderland and the Lendel Bridge, which spans the Ouse at York. Foreign contracts quickly followed, and impressive bridges were constructed in Constantinople and Burma, and for the India State Railway. By mid-century, Crawshay's enterprises had earned him the popular nickname King of Gateshead.<br>
<br>Crawshay's stature as a local businessman inevitably drew him into the realms of municipal government, not least because George Hawks had been Gateshead's first mayor in 1836. Moreover, marriage on 25 February 1847 to Elizabeth (1826&#150;1889), the youngest daughter of Sir John Fife, greatly enhanced Crawshay's already powerful political and social connections. The couple had two sons and one daughter. Crawshay was elected town councillor for West Gateshead in 1854 and appointed mayor three times, in 1856, 1859, and 1863.<br>
<br>Crawshay's political interests, however, stretched far beyond the boundaries of the municipality. Shortly after settling in the north Crawshay involved himself in the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script> and, by 1845, had become the leading spokesman of the local branch. As an avowed radical he supported the Chartists in 1848 and took an active interest in the nationalist struggles of the Poles, the Italians, and the Danes. As a result, he became a close associate of the Russophobic politician David Urquhart (1805&#150;1877) and, as the Crimean War escalated, Crawshay helped to promote the establishment of foreign affairs committees in numerous towns and cities. In 1854 the Newcastle foreign affairs committee, with Crawshay as a major subscriber and leading spokesman, was one of the first to be set up. Although his outspoken defence of the oppressed Turkish people placed him increasingly at odds with W. E. Gladstone and official Liberal policy, especially during the Eastern crisis of the mid-1870s, nevertheless he continued to support their cause. Midhat Pasha became a personal friend and was a frequent visitor at the family home, Haughton Castle, North Tyne. Crawshay was so highly regarded that he later acted as Turkish consul in Newcastle and, interestingly enough, is thought to have been the first person to introduce Turkish baths into England, installing a bath at his Northumberland home, Tynemouth House.<br>
<br>Crawshay firmly believed in the principle of religious toleration, and his beliefs led to membership of the Anti-State Church Association, his vociferous defence of the Muslim Turks, and denunciation of the mischievous &#145;greased cartridge&#146; affair, which precipitated the Indian mutiny (1857&#150;9). His business and political interests nevertheless collided over India in the late 1850s. Although a principal stock holder, Crawshay vehemently opposed ministerial plans to usurp the power of the East India Company. A number of his speeches were published separately.<br>
<br>A man of eclectic interests, Crawshay was an able mathematician and scientist with an acknowledged flair for foreign languages. He also exhibited considerable literary talents, and wrote poetry and romantic drama as well as critical prose, some of which was published in the <span class="italic">Newcastle Chronicle</span>. The manuscript of a semi-autobiographical romance, <span class="italic">A Silver Shape</span>, was finally published in 1980.<br>
<br>His extensive involvement in political affairs, general ill health, and old age all eventually exacted their toll on Crawshay. By the 1870s and 1880s the overcrowded Gateshead site, home to a great diversity of processes and product lines, compared unfavourably with the more streamlined and specialized engineering yards established along the Tyne by entrepreneurs such as Sir William Armstrong. A crisis was reached in 1889, when the &#145;New Greenwich&#146; ironworks of Hawks, Crawshay &amp; Sons at Gateshead was suddenly closed. Crawshay was accused of incompetence and neglect in investing too heavily in new plant and failing to specialize, but the circumstances of the collapse remain somewhat mysterious. Having paid off all his creditors he retired to his daughter's home at Hazelwood, Horsted Keynes, Sussex, where he died on 13 March 1896. Crawshay's estate at the time of his death was valued at just &pound;25.<br>
