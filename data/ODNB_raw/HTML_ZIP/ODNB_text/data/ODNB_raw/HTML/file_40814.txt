<span class="headword">Simms,  Frederick Richard</span>  (1863&#150;1944), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer and businessman</span>, was born on 12 August 1863 in Hamburg (where his grandfather had established a business), the son of Frederick Louis Simms and his wife, Antonia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Herman. Simms was educated in Germany and London and also attended the Polytechnisches Verein in Berlin after serving his apprenticeship with the AG f&uuml;r Automatischen Verkauf in Hamburg and Berlin. Simms was twice married. His first wife was Austrian, but nothing else is known about her; there were two daughters of his second marriage, in 1910, to Mabel Louise, daughter of Joseph Worsley, a cotton merchant.<br>
<br>Simms's European background and contacts contributed to his role as mediator of developments in his chosen fields of activity, the internal combustion engine and its components, and the motor vehicle. A key event was his meeting with Gottlieb Daimler when Simms was superintending the erection of an aerial cableway of his own design at the Bremen Exhibition in 1889. Simms negotiated British patent rights for Daimler engines and in 1890 founded Simms &amp; Co., consulting engineers, which introduced Daimler engines into the United Kingdom, applying them to launches, rather than road vehicles. This work was carried out by the Daimler Motor Syndicate, which Simms founded in 1893 and sold to the financier H. J. Lawson in 1895. This proved to be Lawson's most significant acquisition and led to the foundation of the British motor industry, in the shape of the Daimler works at Coventry Motor Mills. Simms was, however, sufficiently foresighted to keep his own business affairs distinct from those of Lawson. Between 1898 and 1900 Simms operated the Motor Carriage Supply Company Ltd and was in contact with such well-known motoring contemporaries as Emil Jellinek, who stimulated the development of the Mercedes car, and Count Zborowski.<br>
<br>In 1900 Simms became a vehicle manufacturer, with the establishment of the Simms Manufacturing Company Ltd. This produced cars and commercial vehicles in small quantities at the Welbeck Works, Kilburn, from 1904 to 1907&#150;8, as well as engines for other manufacturers. Simms was interested in the military application of the motor vehicle, mounting a Maxim machine gun and an armoured shield on a De Dion quadricycle as the Simms Motor Scout and designing a heavier Motor War Car. They foreshadowed later armoured vehicles, but given the stage reached by automotive technology at the turn of the century, did not directly lead to a line of military vehicles.<br>
<br>Simms's principal legacy to the automotive world was in the field of components, especially magnetos. The Simms Magneto Company Ltd was established in 1907, after he had obtained UK manufacturing rights from Robert Bosch, the German electrical engineer, but small production runs could not compete with the foreign product and the company closed early in 1913. It had been preceded by the joint Compagnie des Magnetos Simms-Bosch (<i>c</i>.1899&#150;1906), which foundered on the personal differences of the principals. Yet Simms may be considered to have played a significant role in magneto development, by his stimulus to Bosch and his colleagues to develop their product, and by opening up the important French market for Bosch.<br>
<br>In 1913 Simms started another business, Simms Motor Units Ltd, initially as a sales and repair organization for motor components, especially dynamos and magnetos. Manufacture was initially undertaken by others on behalf of the firm, an important source in the First World War being the Simms Magneto Company Ltd, of New Jersey, established by Simms in 1910. The English workforce, however, grew from twelve in 1913 to more than 300 by early 1919 and a subsidiary, the Standard Insulator Company Ltd, was established in 1915.<br>
<br>To build on his wartime success, Simms established Simms Motor Units (1920) Ltd in extensive premises in East Finchley. The virtual destruction by fire of the Kilburn works in 1920 and the slump of 1920&#150;21 in the engineering industry brought about the cessation of manufacture until 1926. The Finchley factory was retained, however, trading profits improved, and a separate concern was established in Lyons to produce the Simms&#150;Vernier coupling. In 1930, five years before Simms's retirement, the company moved in new directions to match changing automotive technology, moves culminating in the joint development, with Leyland Motors, of the Uniflow injection pump (1937). In his later years Simms's interests widened to include a tour of inspection of southern Africa in 1928 on behalf of the British motor trade and experimentation in compound metals for electrical contacts, with the establishment of Compound Electro Metals Ltd.<br>
<br>As well as being a businessman, Simms was also a man of affairs in the motor world. Concerned at the close involvement of H. J. Lawson's business interests with his Motor Car Club, Simms launched the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland in 1897. This was joined by Sir David Salomons's Self-Propelled Traffic Association in 1898 and became the Royal Automobile Club in 1907. The problem of trade shows, exacerbated by cycle manufacturers' attempts to include cars in their shows, was met by Simms's foundation in 1902 of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which elected him as its first president. With an interest in aviation, Simms also contributed to what was to become the Royal Aero Club.<br>
<br>In a long, active life Simms touched many aspects of the evolving motor industry, perhaps spreading his talents too thinly for a single, wholly outstanding, achievement. However, the importance of his contribution to the establishment of the motor and component industry and to motoring in the UK should not be under-rated. It is in his role as a catalyst and intermediary between the UK and Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States that his lasting significance lies.<br>
<br>Simms's wife predeceased him, and his own death occurred on 22 April 1944 at Dunbarty, Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. He was cremated at Streatham Vale, London, and his ashes were placed in the Annunciation churchyard beside those of his wife.<br>
