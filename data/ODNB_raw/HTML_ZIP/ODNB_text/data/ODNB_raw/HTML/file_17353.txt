<span class="headword">MacBain, Sir  James</span>  (1828&#150;1892), <span class="occ">businessman and politician in Australia</span>, born on 19 April 1828 at Kinrives, Ross-shire, was the youngest son of Smith MacBain, a farmer, and his wife, Christina Taylor. While he was still an infant his family moved to Scotsburn, and thence to Invergordon. His education was much interrupted by poor health, after his fall from a horse. In 1845 he was apprenticed for five years to Andrew Smith, a draper and warehouseman, of Inverness, and became his bookkeeper and cashier. In 1852 he was employed as a traveller for John Milligan &amp; Co., of Bradford. He married in May 1853 Jessie, the daughter of William Smith of Forres, the brother of his Inverness employer, and the couple immediately emigrated to Melbourne. For four years MacBain held a clerkship in the Bank of New South Wales. In 1857 he paid a visit to Britain, and on his return to Melbourne the following year became managing partner for a branch of the firm of Gibbs, Ronald &amp; Co., mercantile and squatting (pastoral land) agents. In 1863 he became partner in the London house, as well as the colonial branches, and when, two years later, the business was bought by the Australian Mortgage (Mercantile) Land and Finance Company, he became chairman and managing director, a post he retained for over twenty-five years. He was also director of two leading and several other banks and many insurance offices, and engaged extensively and successfully in speculation in agricultural land.<br>
<br>In 1864 MacBain was elected to the legislative assembly of Victoria as member for the Wimmera district, a scattered constituency, which he represented for sixteen years. He was a prominent advocate of the abolition of state aid to religion, but opposed both the <span class="roman">1872 Education Act</span> and the <span class="roman">Land Tax Act</span> as injudicious and imperfect. He supported free trade and the end of squatting after fair compensation to the squatter.<br>
<br>In 1880 MacBain was elected to represent the central (on redistribution of districts in 1882 the South Yarra) province in the legislative council. From August 1881 to March 1883 he was minister without portfolio representing Sir Bryan O'Loghlen's government in the council (he had declined previous offers on account of his business commitments). A solid tory, on 27 November 1884 he became president of the legislative council, and, having fulfilled his duties creditably, was created knight bachelor in 1886 and KCMG in 1889.<br>
<br>MacBain visited England in 1874&#150;5, and again in 1883, when he acted as chairman of the Victorian commissioners at the Amsterdam Exhibition. In 1888 he was president of the executive commission of the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition.<br>
<br>MacBain was a leading member of the Presbyterian church and took an active and generous part in church affairs. He was a trustee of the Scotch College in Melbourne, the Presbyterian Ladies' College, the Melbourne Working Men's College, the Victorian National Gallery, and other institutions, and was president of the Royal Caledonian Society and, for many years, of the board for the protection of Aborigines. After having suffered for some time from the effects of hepatitis, he died, on 4 November 1892, at his home, Scotsburn, Toorak, a Melbourne suburb. He was survived by his widow and their adopted son, MacBain's nephew. He was buried at Booroonda cemetery, Melbourne, on 7 November.<br>
