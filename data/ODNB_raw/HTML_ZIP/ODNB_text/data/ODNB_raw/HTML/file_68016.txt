<span class="headword">Astley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Champernowne]</span>,  Katherine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1565), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the daughter of Sir Philip Champernowne (<i>d</i>. 1545), landowner, of Modbury, Devon, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4625/', "Sir Edmund Carew")</script> of Mohun's Ottery, Devon, and his wife, Katherine. She was related by marriage to all the leading gentry families of the west country. Nothing is known of her early life, although her distinctive, if old-fashioned, hand, her lifelong association with the reformed religion, and her key role in the education of Princess Elizabeth indicate that she received a better education than most women of her class and generation. Sir Philip Champernowne clearly was not against his children's studies and Katherine was commended for her learning.<br>
<br>By October 1536, when probably still a teenager and certainly still unmarried, Katherine had joined Elizabeth's household. Her introduction to court was ostensibly effected by Sir Thomas Cromwell, principal secretary, but her brother-in-law Sir Anthony Denny, who married her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70730/', "Joan Denny")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7506/', "Denny, Sir Anthony")</script>], may also have been instrumental. There is little to distinguish her from her female peers during her first decade of service, and it was only when Elizabeth entered her teens that Katherine emerged as a key figure in her circle. About 1545 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/818/', "John Astley (c.1507&#150;1596)")</script>, courtier, of Allington and Maidstone, Kent, first son of Thomas Astley of Hill Morton and Melton Constable, Norfolk, and his second wife, Anne. Astley was one of Elizabeth's many Norfolk cousins. The couple had no children.<br>
<br>By 1547 Katherine was powerful enough to secure the position of Elizabeth's governess, and her &#145;dilligent overseeinge&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 33271, fol. 46<i>r</i>) of her office gave her a lasting influence&#151;she was particularly close to her charge, encouraging her education. The results of her more overtly political influence were mixed, although it is difficult to establish the extent to which she was an independent player or the tool of others when she encouraged Elizabeth to consider marriage with Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley, lord admiral, in 1548. Astley warned his wife not to encourage Elizabeth's &#145;affection&#146; towards Seymour, recognizing the danger of meddling in royal marriages, but Katherine was quite smitten with the lord admiral's charms herself  (Hatfield, Cecil MS 150, fol. 86<i>r</i>). Seymour joked about Katherine with his servant and illegitimate half-brother John Seymour, asking him to enquire &#145;whither her great buttokes were grown eny les or no&#146;  (ibid., fols. 85<i>r</i>&#150;87<i>r</i>). Anne Seymour, duchess of Somerset, was scathing about Katherine's performance of her office, saying &#145;she was not worthy to have the governance of a kinges doughter&#146;, while Denny warned her to moderate her behaviour  (ibid., fol. 80<i>r</i>). In January 1549, in the wake of Seymour's fall, she was sent to the Tower while her husband was put in the Fleet prison. As the execution just seven years earlier of Jane, Viscountess Rochford, had shown, complicity in royal affairs could be fatal, even for women, and Katherine was now terrified, however belatedly. Her depositions supplied the grounds needed for Seymour's conviction for treason, while she was spared because of the lack of interest in pursuing Elizabeth, and indeed was released shortly afterwards. Elizabeth pleaded successfully for the restoration of both Astleys to her household. Katherine was reinstated by 1551, and remained in Elizabeth's service following Mary I's accession, although her suspected involvement in the Dudley conspiracy resulted in a second spell in the Tower in 1556, leading to her dismissal.<br>
<br>Katherine enjoyed a level of favour after Elizabeth's accession matched by no women and few men. She was appointed chief gentlewoman of the privy chamber, and &#145;had such influence with the queen that she seemed, as it were, patroness of all England&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Rome</span>, <i>1558&#150;71</i>, 105). Unsurprisingly, her relations with other leading figures were complex; her active promotion of rivals for Elizabeth's hand in marriage angered Sir Robert Dudley, and led to two more brief periods of imprisonment, the last in 1562 for encouraging the suit of Erik XIV of Sweden, although once again she fully recovered her position at court within a matter of months. She died in London in her prime, on 18 July 1565, and was probably buried there. Katherine Astley was a powerful, if not particularly rich, woman whose influence derived solely from her friendship with Elizabeth, and was founded less on birth or political skill than on unswerving personal loyalty and an impregnable emotional bond with her mistress.<br>
