<span class="headword">Willans,  (Herbert) Geoffrey</span>  (1911&#150;1958), <span class="occ">humorist</span>, was born on 4 February 1911, the second of the three children of George Herbert Willans (<i>d</i>. before 1945), a senior engineer. He was educated at Glyngarth preparatory school in Cheltenham and, from 1924 to 1929, at Blundell's School, Tiverton. After leaving school Geoffrey Willans spent a period as a preparatory-school master at Woodcote House School in Surrey, before being able to make a living from journalism. His friend the artist Ronald Searle remembered him as &#145;shortish, dapper&#151;a careful dresser. Very accessible, with a splendidly broad smile. Slightly clownlike &hellip; But there was nothing clownish about him. Entirely professional. Friendly but not a dupe &hellip; Must have been a jolly nice schoolmaster&#146;  (private information, R. Searle).<br>
<br>Willans's first books were urbane humorous novels: <span class="italic">Shallow Dive</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Romantic Manner</span> (1936). Pre-war small-boat sailing led to a wartime temporary commission in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, serving on convoy escorts, which he wrote up as <span class="italic">One Eye on the Clock</span> (1943). On 9 November 1940 at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, London, he married Pamela Wyndham Gibbes (<i>b</i>. 1911/12), daughter of Lewes Nicholas Gibbes, a physician of Kensington Church Street, and his wife, Mignonette Middlemass. The couple had two sons, born in 1943 and 1947. Willans's wartime writing included comic articles for <span class="italic">Punch</span> magazine using his preparatory-school experience. After demobilization he worked briefly for PA Reuter Features then, from 1945, for the BBC European Service, while continuing to contribute to magazines. A contemporary summary of his journalism noted his coverage of the 1948 Olympic games, an interview with President Eisenhower, and articles on human rights for all.<br>
<br>In 1952 Willans consulted Ronald Searle, whose St Trinian's wicked-schoolgirl cartoon books were then at the height of their success, about his plan to write a full-length humorous book with a preparatory-school theme. This plan coincided with Searle's being &#145;sick to death&#146; of St Trinian's, though his publisher was pressing him to supply similarly best-selling material for the Christmas book market. Willans's text appealed to Searle, and the first Molesworth book, <span class="italic">Down with Skool!</span>, was published in October 1953. It was hugely popular, with 53,848 copies sold before the end of the year. Searle's was the ready-made reputation, and the text provided ideal prompts for his caricatures. But Willans's creations, the knowing schoolboy&#150;narrator Nigel Molesworth together with the other St Custard's School boys and staff, rapidly became celebrated in their own right.<br>
<br>The next two Molesworth books with Searle illustrations, <span class="italic">How to be Topp</span> and <span class="italic">Whizz for Atomms</span>, appeared for the 1954 and 1956 autumn publishing seasons, and Willans also published in quick succession several other journalistic and humorous books, though none achieved the same lasting fame. In the spring of 1958 Willans left the staff of the BBC to earn his living from freelance writing. A compilation, <span class="italic">The Compleet Molesworth</span>, was in proof and the text of the fourth Molesworth book, <span class="italic">Back in the Jug Agane</span>, was ready for publication the following year when Willans died suddenly, at the London Hospital, Stepney, on 6 August 1958, aged forty-seven, of a heart attack. <span class="italic">The Compleet Molesworth</span> was published in 1958 with an introduction by Ronald Searle, and subsequent editions have been in both separate and &#145;compleet&#146; form.<br>
<br>In the decades following publication the name &#145;Molesworth&#146; became a byword for the books' best-known features&#151;the narrator's artfully bad spelling, schoolboys such as &#145;uterly wet and sissy&#146; fotherington-tomas declaiming &#145;Hello clouds, hello sky&#146;, venal schoolmasters, and the whole shambolic institution of St Custard's itself as a proxy for the adult world:<blockquote>Wot would everyone say if we skoolboys behaved like the nations of the globe? I will tell you. They would sa we were stupid, crass, ignorant, hopeless, weedy and sans un clue. And yet it still go on. It is time i took over. I can see it all. (G. Willans, <span class="italic">Back in the Jug Agane</span>)</blockquote>The Molesworth books were at first widely seen simply as sophisticated schoolboy comedy, and the <span class="italic">Time Magazine</span> review in October 1955 accused them of &#145;whimsy, which has long been the curse of British humour&#146;, but their reputation as classics grew quickly. In 1958 the <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist wrote that Willans's &#145;early and tragic death is a bitter loss to his innumerable friends and has robbed the field of English humour of one of its most stimulating and refreshing writers&#146;, and by 1992 the <span class="italic">Independent</span> review of the reissue claimed that &#145;these books are classics of humour in the English language. To classify them simply as schoolboy yarns is to confuse setting for theme.&#146; In 1999 Philip Hensher's introduction to the <span class="roman">Penguin Modern Classics</span> edition set the books alongside other English classics of the late 1940s and 1950s whose stance was post-war cynicism, exploring &#145;a single disaffected mind within a depressing and faintly gothic setting&#146;: they were books with &#145;a ferocious satirical bite &hellip; not about school, nor about childhood, but about England&#146;.<br>
