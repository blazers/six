<span class="headword">O'Mahony <span class="st"> [Mahony, Mahun, Marullus]</span>,  Connor <span class="st"> [Constantine; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>name in religion </em>Cornelius a Sancto Patricio]</span>  (1594&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Jesuit and political controversialist</span>, was born in Muskerry, co. Cork. On 17 March 1621 he entered the Society of Jesus in Portugal; Cornelius a Sancto Patricio was the name by which he was known in the society. He was professor of theology at &Eacute;vora (about 100 kilometres east of Lisbon), and he appears to have been a noted moral theologian in Lisbon, where he was associated with the Jesuit church of S&atilde;o Roque (hence his additional subsidiary name, de Rocha). Acquaintances described him as brave and pious, and he is said to have rendered great services during an earthquake and volcanic eruption on the island of St Michael in the Azores.<br>
<br>Patrick Plunkett, titular bishop of Ardagh and subsequently of Meath, made O'Mahony's acquaintance in Lisbon between 1651 and 1660, as did John Serjeant, an English secular priest who studied at Lisbon. O'Mahony claimed to both Plunkett and Serjeant that he was the author of a controversial book on Ireland, and to the former he gave a copy. The volume contains two texts: &#145;Disputatio apologetica de jure regni Hiberniae pro Catholicis Hibernis adversus haereticos Anglos&#146; and &#145;Accessit ejusdem authoris ad eosdem Catholicos exhortatio&#146;. Although the book purports to have been published in Frankfurt, it is clear that Lisbon is the actual place of publication. The date of publication is 1645. The book was a conscious, and partisan, intervention in the Irish civil unrest initiated by the Irish rising of 1641. In these two treatises O'Mahony argued that the four main arguments adduced in support of English rights over Ireland&#151;conquest, papal gift, submission, and prescription&#151;were all false. Even if they were true, the fact that the kings of England were now protestant heretics meant that their claims were null and void. He urged the Catholics of Ireland to continue killing all the protestants in their midst, as well as any Catholics who refused to abandon their allegiance to the English throne, and to establish a new Catholic monarch who should be a &#145;vernacular or natural&#146; Irishman. In 1647, or perhaps earlier, some copies of this inflammatory book reached Ireland through France or direct from Portugal. Its presence served to highlight deep divisions between the main political forces in Ireland. Stuart partisans were outraged by its assumptions, landowners felt that it undermined the basis of their property rights, while its call for a native king was interpreted both as support for the putative regal ambitions of Owen Roe O'Neill, and as questioning the legitimacy of the Anglo-Norman (&#145;Old English&#146;) position in Ireland (though in fact O'Mahony wished to overcome ethnic differences between Irish Catholics). A copy was found with John Bane, parish priest of Athlone, and the nuncio Rinuccini was called upon by the confederate Catholics at Kilkenny to punish him: the nuncio refused to do this, but the book was burned by the common hangman, and rigorous search was made for copies at Galway. Peter Walsh, by the command of the supreme council, preached nine sermons against it at Kilkenny Castle. The book also ran into trouble in Portugal. O'Mahony had drawn a parallel between Portugal's recent rejection of its Castilian overlord in favour of a native prince and the situation in Ireland. Complaints of O'Mahony's book were lodged at Lisbon by an English priest (perhaps John Sergeant). King John IV, incensed by its attack on a fellow monarch, condemned it in December 1647, and it was made penal to possess a copy. O'Mahony died in Lisbon on 28 February 1656.<br>
