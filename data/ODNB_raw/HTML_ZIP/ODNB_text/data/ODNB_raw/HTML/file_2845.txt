<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bonington,  Richard Parkes</span>  (1802&#150;1828), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 25 October 1802 in Arnold, near Nottingham, and baptized there at High Pavement Unitarian Chapel on 28 November, the only child of Richard Bonington (1768&#150;1835) and Eleanor Parkes (<i>d</i>. 1838). His father inherited the post of governor of Nottingham gaol in 1789, but eight years later resigned that sinecure under duress to become a drawing master and portrait painter. He would exhibit landscapes and watercolours at the Royal Academy in London in 1797 and 1808 and at the Liverpool Academy in 1811 and 1813. His posthumous and justly deserved reputation as an opportunist and exploiter of his progeny's fame has perhaps overshadowed the fact that he was a reasonably competent artist whose industry satisfied a variety of cultural needs in the provinces. He conducted weekly drawing lessons at the Jennings circulating library in Sheffield, for instance. In 1801 the senior Bonington married Eleanor Parkes, an educated woman with prior experience tutoring children, and together they managed in Nottingham until 1813 a finishing school for girls and a &#145;repository of arts&#146; that stocked artists' supplies and the latest graphic arts from London. The nearly 3000 old master and modern prints auctioned by his estate (Sothebys, 24 February 1838) would have figured prominently in the earliest artistic instruction of his son, for which he was unquestionably responsible.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Economic stagnation during the second decade of the century devastated Nottingham, and in a distressed financial state the Boningtons moved in the autumn of 1817 to Calais, where the father had established a lace-making business in partnership with two other expatriate Nottinghamshire businessmen. The younger Bonington's earliest known works of art date from after his arrival in France. Although initially discouraged by his parents, he refined his skills as a painter of marine watercolours under the tutelage of the Anglo-French artist Louis Francia, who, after many successful years in London as a watercolourist, had returned to Calais only months before the Boningtons' arrival. The impact of Francia's style is actually less apparent in Bonington's earliest watercolours than in those of 1823, when the two artists again worked in close association in Paris.<br>
<br>Following the dissolution of the Calais partnership in October 1818, the family moved to Paris in the spring and opened a retail lace business at 22 rue des Moulins. They would subsequently occupy premises at 27 rue Michel le Comte and 16 rue des Mauvaises-Paroles. The younger Bonington began copying Dutch and Flemish paintings in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, where he met Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix. On the recommendation of the English artist James Roberts, whom he also met in the Louvre, Bonington was enrolled in April 1819 in the studio of Baron Antoine-Jean Gros, France's pre-eminent painter of historical subjects. Gros's studio, located in the Institut de France, was the most prestigious in Paris. Among the fellow pupils whom Bonington would befriend at this time were Eug&egrave;ne Lami, Camille Roqueplan, Paul Huet, and Henri Monnier. However, large-scale, academic figure painting was anathema to Bonington, and he eventually renounced formal training for a regimen of self-tuition in naturalistic landscape painting. Late in 1821 he made the first of several tours of Normandy, journeying to Rouen and then along the coast from Caen to Abbeville. Two watercolours from this trip, <span class="italic">Vue prise &agrave; Lillebonne</span> and <span class="italic">Vue prise au Havre</span>, received favourable critical notice when exhibited at the 1822 Paris Salon and were acquired by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Amis des Arts. Watercolour painting was considered a British speciality and was not much practised at this time in France, but Bonington's bravura technique soon attracted both private collectors and numerous imitators. These early topographical watercolours, exhibited in the gallery of Madame Hulin and Claude Schroth at 18 rue de la Paix, Paris, Camille Corot later acknowledged as the inspiration for his becoming a painter.<h2>
<a name="Earlycommissions"></a>Early commissions</h2>Until 1823 Bonington painted exclusively in watercolours, both for the middle-class cognoscenti and for publishers of illustrated topographical and antiquarian books. His first topographical commission was to copy in watercolours a sketch by the comte de Forbin for J. F. d'Ostervald's <span class="italic">Voyage pittoresque en Sicile</span> (1822&#150;6), a <i>tour de force</i> of British printmaking technology, for which the Swiss-born publisher employed a battery of English watercolourists and aquatint etchers, including the entire Fielding family. With the proceeds of his watercolour sales, Bonington visited Belgium in 1823 and again toured Normandy, gathering material to illustrate Ostervald's <span class="italic">Excursions sur les c&ocirc;tes et dans les ports de France</span>, and for his own set of lithographic views of Gothic architectural monuments, <span class="italic">Restes et fragmens [<i>sic</i>] d'architecture du moyen &acirc;ge</span>, also called <span class="italic">La petite Normandie</span>. Despite their great beauty as drawings, the last portfolio was a commercial failure owing to printing problems and the lack of any descriptive text. <span class="italic">Restes et fragmens</span> would appear in 1824, as would his most innovative lithographic contributions to Baron Taylor's voluminous <span class="italic">Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France</span>. Like most artists of his generation, Bonington admired the enchanting blend of historical pageantry and exacting archaeological research that typified the novels of Sir Walter Scott, and his &#145;instinctive predilection for historical reminiscences&#146;  (Roberts) is evidenced in these scrupulously observed antiquarian prints, as well as in his later genre lithographs <span class="italic">Cahier de six sujets</span> (1826) and the pseudo-Gothic illuminations for Ferdinand Langl&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Contes du gay s&ccedil;avoir</span> (1827).<h2>
<a name="Marineoilpaintings"></a>Marine oil paintings</h2>The year 1824 was one of tremendous ferment in the arts. In the spring, two of the titans of romanticism died tragically&#151;Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault in Paris and Lord Byron in Missolonghi. Jacques-Louis David's principal disciple, Anne-Louis Girodet, would also not survive the year. In February Bonington and the artist Alexandre-Marie Colin left Paris for the coastal town of Dunkirk. This sketching tour, planned to last but a few weeks, developed into a self-imposed exile of nearly one year's duration. It was during this sojourn, which the artist described as the &#145;happiest year of my life&#146;, that Bonington concentrated on the marine oil paintings that would trumpet his arrival as a serious artist at the Paris Salon in August. The 1824 Salon was the most passionately contested cultural event in France of the 1820s, pitting the academic painters of David's school against the younger generation of artists, like Delacroix, who identified themselves as romantics. British artists were also invited to exhibit, and Bonington shared in the notoriety accorded such celebrities as Sir Thomas Lawrence and John Constable. With its vivacious brushwork and its serene expansiveness, <span class="italic">A Fishmarket, Near Boulogne</span> (Yale U. CBA), for which Bonington was awarded a gold medal, was a brilliant exercise in Anglo-Dutch naturalism without parallel in contemporary French practice. Altogether Bonington exhibited under his own name four marine oils, a watercolour view of Abbeville, and an impression of his <span class="italic">Rue de Grosse-Horloge, Rouen</span>, which remains one of the signal images of early lithography. Under Ostervald's name appeared an unspecified number of Bonington's watercolours related to various topographical publications. The success of the Salon pictures thrust the diffident artist to the forefront of the French romantic movement. His work, with that of John Constable, would influence the course of French landscape painting for the next decade.<h2>
<a name="VisittoEngland"></a>Visit to England</h2>Inspired by what they had seen of British art at the Salon, Bonington and numerous French colleagues, including Colin, Delacroix, Hippolyte Poterlet, &Eacute;douard Bertin, and Augustin Enfantin, travelled to London in summer 1825. While in England, Bonington developed close ties to Delacroix and Eug&egrave;ne Isabey, working with the former at Westminster and at the collection of the antiquarian Dr Samuel Meyrick, and with the latter on the Normandy coast at the conclusion of their trip. Through the offices of the engravers Abraham Raimbach and William Cooke, he probably visited the superb old master and modern paintings collections of Sir Walter Fawkes, Sir John Leicester, and the marquess of Stafford, where he would have discovered the extraordinary range and power of J. M. W. Turner's art. In response to Constable and Turner, Bonington began painting oil sketches <i>en plein air</i> using a commercially prepared millboard that was readily available in London, and he enlarged his repertory of subjects to include a variety of landscape types, especially river scenes at twilight.<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>After a sketching tour with Paul Huet along the Seine in autumn 1825, Bonington moved into Delacroix's Paris studio in the rue Jacob. Through Delacroix he was introduced to the most progressive French literati, including Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Charles Nodier, Victor Hugo, and Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Pichot, for whom he illustrated <span class="italic">Vues pittoresques de l'&Eacute;cosse</span> (1825&#150;6). While Delacroix and his circle persuaded Bonington to expand the scope of his ambitions to include historical subjects in oils, the earliest of which is <span class="italic">Anne Page and Slender</span> (Wallace Collection, London), Bonington's seminal influence on Delacroix is sensed, as Th&eacute;ophile Gautier first observed, in the new &eacute;clat of colouring and the more assured handling of paint that is evident in the French artist's pictures of 1826, in particular, his <span class="italic">Combat of the Giaour and Hassan</span> (Art Institute of Chicago) and the <span class="italic">Execution of the Doge Marino Faliero</span> (Wallace Collection, London). The clarity and dazzling execution of Bonington's style also inspired Delacroix and other French painters, like Alexandre Decamps, Charles Gleyre, Isabey, and Huet, to explore watercolour painting with renewed commitment.<br>
<br>In February 1826 the critic for the <span class="italic">London Literary Gazette</span> asked in his review of the annual exhibition of contemporary art at the British Institution, &#145;Who is R. P. Bonington?&#146; The two oil paintings, <span class="italic">French Coast Scenery</span> and <span class="italic">French Coast with Fishermen</span> (both priv. coll.), that the artist had sent from Paris for inclusion in the exhibition had astounded his British compatriots who were seeing his work for the first time. In the spring, Bonington moved to his own studio at 11 rue des Martyrs, a building owned by Jules-Robert Auguste, an amateur artist and former friend of G&eacute;ricault. Shortly thereafter he commenced a tour of northern Italy and Switzerland in the company of a friend and pupil, the future Baron Charles Rivet. Delacroix was meant to accompany them but at the last minute withdrew. Since it was the Italy of Shakespeare and Byron that fascinated Bonington, he spent most of his time in Venice, where he produced a substantial number of graphite, watercolour, and oil sketches of the principal monuments and views. These furnished him with studies for major exhibition pictures that he would send to the Salon and to the Royal Academy in 1828. As one of the earliest nineteenth-century artists to depict Venice in its faded splendour, Bonington appears to have influenced the way many French writers, including Chateaubriand, perceived the city. Antoine Claude Pasquin (M. Val&eacute;ry), who was travelling in Italy at the same time, would write that:<blockquote>Bonington, a British artist of melancholy cast, has painted some new views of Venice in which is most perfectly sketched its present desolation; when compared with those of the Venetian painter Canaletto, they resemble a woman still beautiful but worn down by age and misfortune. (<span class="italic">Voyages historiques et litt&eacute;raires en Italie</span>, 1831, 143)</blockquote>The experience of Venetian Renaissance painting was also important to Bonington's increasingly comprehensive artistic interests, and, on resettling in Paris, he would become preoccupied once again with genre subjects.<br>
<br>After leaving Venice at the end of May, Bonington travelled to Padua, Florence, Pisa, Sarzana, Lerici, Spezzia, Genoa, and Turin. It has been assumed on the evidence of Rivet's correspondence that the two friends were back in Paris by 20 June; however, extant drawings from Staubbach, Thun, Bern, and Basel suggest that Bonington possibly separated from his companion and returned to France by way of Switzerland, thus extending his journey by perhaps several weeks.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>The last two years of Bonington's life were marked by astounding popular success both in England and in France. The development of his painting technique was breathtaking and experimental. By the summer of 1827 there was little but scale to distinguish visually between his work in oils and his work in watercolours. The denser texture of oil paint is simulated with gouache in the watercolours, while the limpidity of translucent watercolours has its analogue in the oil glazes that begin to dominate in his canvases. Although he continued to paint marines, including the radiant <span class="italic">On the C&ocirc;te d'Opale, Picardy</span> (priv. coll.), exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1827, his primary subject interests were now views of Venice and illustrations to medieval and Renaissance history or the literary works of Scott and Goethe. In his genre paintings he was much influenced by the emerging science of modern historiography, with its demand for archaeological exactitude, and by the type of intimate historical painting known in France as the Troubadour style, of which Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was then the foremost exponent. But, unlike Ingres, Bonington was also enamoured of the expressive techniques and colouring of Venetian painting, which he endeavoured to translate into his own stylistic idiom. His final master-works in this genre are <span class="italic">Quentin Durward at Li&egrave;ge</span> (Nottingham Castle Museum), which was commissioned by the duchesse de Berri, <span class="italic">Henri IV and the Spanish Ambassador</span>, and <span class="italic">Henri III of France</span> (both Wallace Collection, London).<br>
<br>At the end of 1827 Bonington moved his studio for the final time to 32 rue St Lazare and sent to the Salon two oil paintings, the <span class="italic">Ducal Palace</span> (Tate collection) and <span class="italic">Rouen Cathedral</span>, together with a watercolour and several lithographic interpretations of drawings by Maurice Rugendas for <span class="italic">Voyages pittoresques en Br&eacute;sil</span> (1827). He again travelled to London in January 1828, where he met Sir Thomas Lawrence and exhibited <span class="italic">The Piazzetta, Venice</span> and <span class="italic">View of the Ducal Palace, Venice</span> (both Tate collection) at the British Institution. In February he exhibited, at the second Salon instalment, <span class="italic">Francis I and the Queen of Navarre</span> (untraced), <span class="italic">Henri IV and the Spanish Ambassador</span> (Wallace Collection, London) and <span class="italic">Entrance to the Grand Canal</span> (priv. coll.), a large picture commissioned by the publisher James Carpenter. To the Royal Academy, in May, he sent <span class="italic">Henri III</span> (Wallace Collection, London), Carpenter's <span class="italic">Grand Canal</span>, and a coast scene. Within a month of that exhibition, Bonington collapsed from either sunstroke or nervous exhaustion, and, in a weakened state, succumbed to tuberculosis. In an effort to save him, his parents took him to London in August, but treatment proved futile, and he died on 23 September at 29 Tottenham Street, the home of the publisher John Barnett. During his final illness he was attended by Thomas Shotter Boys, who helped him produce his only etching, <span class="italic">Bologna: the Leaning Towers</span>. He was buried in London, on 29 September 1828, at St James's Chapel, Pentonville, and later reinterred, at Kensal Green cemetery, in 1837. In a letter to his spouse, the engraver George Cooke described the funeral and its many mourners, among whom were some of the first names in British painting: Sir Thomas Lawrence, Henry William Pickersgill, Clarkson Stanfield, John Frederick Lewis, and George Fennel Robson  (J. Munday, <span class="italic">Edward William Cooke</span>, 1996, 44).<br>
<br>The little that we know of Bonington's character and appearance comes from two sources&#151;a manuscript recollection written by James Roberts, probably in response to Allen Cunningham's flawed biographical notice of 1832, and a letter from Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix to Th&eacute;ophile Thor&eacute;  (Noon, <span class="italic">On the Pleasure of Painting</span>, 12), composed decades after Bonington's death. Roberts had only recently preceded Bonington to Paris in 1817, and he recalled meeting him in the Louvre copying a picture by G&eacute;rard Dou. It was Roberts who alleged that there occurred a breach in the relationship between Bonington and Gros, which resulted in his unjust expulsion from the studio. Roberts also noted that:<blockquote>Bonington's appearance at that time was particularly boyish owing to his round plump cheeks &hellip; yet [one] would observe in his eyes unequivocal marks of intelligence. Although he was never noisy or boisterous like his comrades of the atelier he was fond of mirth. (Roberts)</blockquote>Rivet, in his correspondence from Italy, described his companion as moody, obsessively self-critical, and addicted to his studies (Dubuisson and Hughes). Delacroix, on the other hand, wrote, &#145;I knew him well and loved him much. His British composure, which was imperturbable, in no way diminished those qualities that make life enjoyable&#146;. His assessment of Bonington's merits was extremely apt:<blockquote>To my mind, one can find in other modern artists qualities of strength and of precision in rendering that are superior to those in Bonington's pictures, but no one in this modern school, and perhaps even before, has possessed that lightness of touch which, especially in the watercolours, makes his work a type of diamond that flatters and ravishes the eye. (Noon, <span class="italic">On the Pleasure of Painting</span>, 12)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>After his death Bonington's reputation grew prodigiously. Lawrence, who owned several of his pictures including <span class="italic">A Seated Turk</span> (Yale U. CBA) and the resplendent <span class="italic">Lerici</span> (priv. coll.), actively promoted his reputation in England. In France his legacy was even more zealously defended. For writers and critics from Flaubert and Sainte-Beuve to Baudelaire and Thor&eacute;, Bonington was not only the equal of Turner and Constable, but also, with Delacroix and G&eacute;ricault, one of the pillars of modern sensibility&#151;an exquisite colourist and technician whose affinity with nature made his works emotional as well as painterly statements of the highest calibre. Bonington never sought, like Turner or G&eacute;ricault or Delacroix, to depict the sublime events of nature and history, and he had little interest in the theoretical, but his vision was no less seminal to the development of modern art.<br>
<br>Despite the persistent high reputation of the artist through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there have been surprisingly few exhibitions of Bonington's work. The first retrospective was organized by Paul Opp&eacute; for the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1937. The Nottingham Castle Museum exhibition of 1965 was the largest, while the 1991 exhibition in New Haven and Paris (Yale Center for British Art and Petit Palais) focused on defining a corpus of authentic masterworks from the plethora of imitations and forgeries that began flooding the markets as early as 1830. The most impressive single collection of Bonington's works is in the Wallace Collection, London, the benefaction of the most resolute of the artist's collectors, Sir Richard Wallace. At the first studio sale of 1829, the marquess of Lansdowne purchased a significant collection of architectural and Venetian drawings, which are now at Bowood House, Wiltshire. In Bonington's adoptive city, the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale houses the Atherton Curtis bequest of drawings and prints and a number of Bonington's manuscript letters. The Mus&eacute;e du Louvre has several notable oils. Other important groups of works are in the British Museum and the Nottingham Castle Museum. During the twentieth century there has been only one tenacious collector, Paul Mellon, who donated eleven oil paintings to the Yale Center for British Art.<br>
