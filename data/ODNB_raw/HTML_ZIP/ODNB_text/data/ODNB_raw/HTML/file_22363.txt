<span class="headword">Player, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was apparently born in Canterbury, Kent. Authorities differ about his parentage. He was probably the son of Thomas Player, linen draper, of Canterbury, who was bound apprentice to a member of the London Haberdashers' Company in April 1611. An Oxford graduate of 1630, of the same name and also of Canterbury, may have been a close kinsman, as was John Player, the puritan divine who became a leading Independent of Canterbury in the 1640s.<br>
<br>Eventually a freeman of the Haberdashers' Company, Player was a hosier by trade and in 1638 a resident of the London parish of St Leonard Eastcheap. He first acquired prominence in the City as a signer of parliamentary puritan petitions in 1641&#150;2. He became a member of common council for Bridge Within ward, serving from 1642 until 1649. Appointed a captain in the trained bands in 1642, he was sent with his regiment to relieve parliamentary forces at Gloucester and eventually became a militia colonel. In July 1642 he was one of sixty-six common councilmen who petitioned the House of Lords against Lord Mayor Sir Richard Gurney, who was impeached and replaced by Isaac Penington. Player served on important city committees between 1643 and 1646. Among these was the Salters' Hall subcommittee of the militia committee, which recruited volunteers for the war against Charles I. Player also became an army provisioner and was identified as a leading civic Independent in 1646, when presbyterians gained control of civic affairs.<br>
<br>Player's religious and political views may, however, have been somewhat cross-grained. In October 1646 he was elected elder for a London presbyterian classis, but he apparently chose not to serve, despite the encouragement of his neighbour Nehemiah Wallington. A few months later he was removed by the London presbyterians from the civic militia committee, together with such Independents as Penington and Robert Tichborne. When the army intervened in the corporation of London in August of that year, Player was among those restored to superintendency of the trained bands. He joined with other leading Independents in securing a contract for provisioning the army in Ireland in March 1648. After the army's London incursion, one presbyterian writer decried Player as a leading civic &#145;Apostate&#146;, but he and a colleague were pilloried in a May 1648 verse as men who:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">both their parts can <i>play</i>,<br>
</div>
<div>on either side that beares the greatest <i>sway</i>.<br>
</div>(<span class="italic">A paire of Spectacles for the Citie</span>, 10; <span class="italic">Mercurius Elencticus</span>, no. 26, 203)</blockquote>Indeed, during a resurgence of political presbyterianism in London in the summer of 1648 Player was appointed to a civic committee to petition parliament for a personal treaty with the king.<br>
<br>Player disappeared from civic politics after the execution of Charles I and the creation of the Commonwealth, but he returned in October 1651. He was then elected chamberlain at a time of increasing sectarian influence in the city and of diminishing confidence in its financial resources. In 1653 he was appointed by the council of state to a commission to consider complaints of merchants who had sustained losses at the hands of Portuguese colonial authorities in Africa. Thereafter he became a political survivor, serving as chamberlain under the protectorate, the revived Commonwealth, and Charles II. In March 1660 the restored Long Parliament appointed him a militia commissioner for the Tower Hamlets. By the 1660s Player had acquired a residence in Mare Street, Hackney.<br>
<br>During a civic entertainment on 5 July 1660 Player and his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22364/', "Thomas Player")</script>, were knighted by Charles II in gratitude for loans made to the restored monarchy through the London chamber. In the early 1660s, as he made regular payments for the government out of continuing civic loans, Player was appointed receiver for various taxes for London and several counties. In time he became a civic banker to the crown, routinely advancing money for the navy and other offices and receiving at least &pound;4300 for his services. Samuel Pepys visited Player twice in 1666&#150;8 about the navy's credit in the city, describing him as a man he had &#145;much heard of for his credit and punctuality&#146;  (Pepys, 7.72). Player's wife, Rebecca, died in 1667. Player himself died in December 1672 and was buried at St John-at-Hackney on 9 December, a few weeks after his resignation as chamberlain. He left his entire estate to his only surviving son and executor, Thomas, who also succeeded him as chamberlain.<br>
