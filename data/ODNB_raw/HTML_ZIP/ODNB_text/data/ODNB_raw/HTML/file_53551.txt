<span class="headword">Moyes,  Henry</span>  (1749/50&#150;1807), <span class="occ">lecturer on natural philosophy</span>, was born near Kirkcaldy in Fife, one of three sons and a daughter of Henry Moyes (<i>d</i>. 1774). The latter was tenant at Westmill of Abbotshall, near Kirkcaldy, and a nonconformist. Moyes was left blinded by smallpox in infancy, but he apparently distinguished himself at Kirkcaldy grammar school. In 1793 Dr James Currie described how<blockquote>when Dr Adam Smith was writing his profound work on the &#145;Wealth of Nations&#146; at Kirkaldy [<i>sic</i>] in Scotland, he used to wander in the evenings&#151;In these excursions, a blind boy of the village of humble situation, but of great ingenuity, became his constant companion. He became attached to this boy; gave him some instruction himself, and directed his education throughout&#151;In due time he sent him with letters to Hume to the University of Edinburgh. Hume got him what is called a Bursary &hellip; and exerted all his characteristic benevolence in his favour. After a few years residence in Edinburgh Smith removed him to Glasgow and furnished him with letters to Dr Reid. He was again equally fortunate, and after many years residence between the two Universities, in due time, the blind man, became a Dr. of physic. This was Moyes. (Dr James Currie to Thomas Creevey, 24 Feb 1793, Lpool RO, Currie MS 920 CUR)</blockquote>No record of Moyes's university attendance has been discovered. One account stated that &#145;in early life he undoubtedly acquired the fundamental principles of mechanics, music, and the languages; and displayed a knowledge of geometry, algebra, optics, astronomy, chemistry, and in short most of the branches of Newtonian philosophy&#146;  (Kay, 177). As his blindness precluded Moyes from practising medicine, he became, in Edinburgh, a lecturer on chemistry and natural philosophy, relying on an assistant for the demonstrations.<br>
<br>In 1779 Moyes left for England, and lectured all round the country. A contemporary remarked:<blockquote>Dr Henry Moyes, the elegant reader on philosophical chemistry &hellip; excelled in the charms of conversation; was happy in his allusions to visual objects; and discoursed on the nature, composition, and beauty of colours, with pertinence and precision. Doctor Moyes was a striking instance of the power, the human soul possesses, of finding resources of satisfaction, even under the most rigorous calamities. (Bew, 168&#150;71)</blockquote>In 1783 Joseph Priestley introduced him to Sir Joseph Banks, president of the Royal Society, as:<blockquote>an excellent lecturer in philosophy &hellip; a phenomenon &hellip; being quite blind, and yet superior to most who see. He is a man of most amiable disposition, and tho' he cannot himself make many experiments, he gets them made for him by an assistant, so that none of his hearers ever complain on that account. (Joseph Priestley to Joseph Banks, 6 Feb 1783, NHM, Dawson Turner MS 3, fol. 17)</blockquote>Through travel and introductions he joined the network of the men of science. From Manchester he went to Birmingham, where he encountered members of the Lunar Society, but James Watt found him argumentative.<br>
<br>Perhaps Moyes's political radicalism (which may have angered Watt) was the motive behind his visit to the fledgeling United States of America (1784&#150;6). He lectured to rapturous success in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Princeton, and Charleston, South Carolina, before returning to England. In 1789 he gave two courses of lectures in Dublin. His lectures in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1780 and 1793 proved influential, and he was elected among the first honorary members of the local literary and philosophical society in 1795. Similarly, at Hull in 1792 Moyes appears to have been a prime mover in the formation of a Society for the Purpose of Literary Information, was elected its first president, and had his portrait done by John Russell. During his last decade Moyes travelled extensively, accompanied by his assistant, William Nicol. He spent part of each year recuperating in Fife, where he had acquired Lumbenny, a small property. He never married. He died in Doncaster, where he was holding a lecture course, on 10 December 1807, aged fifty-seven. He was buried in the town on 14 December.<br>
<br>As he never published, Moyes's reputation faded with his memory. More recently, with increasing historical interest in the rise of science in British provincial culture, his role has been reassessed, in particular by Inkster: he was one of a group of itinerant lecturers who helped the ideas of the literary and philosophical movement further permeate the social spectrum, to assist the beginnings of the mechanics' institutes.<br>
