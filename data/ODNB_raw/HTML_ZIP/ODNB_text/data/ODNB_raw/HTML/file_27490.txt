<span class="headword">Todd,  Hugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1657&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, born at Blencow in Cumberland, was the eldest son of Thomas Todd, rector of Hutton in the Forest in the same county, who was ejected by Cromwell's sequestrators and imprisoned at Carlisle. Educated at Queen's College, Oxford, he matriculated on 29 March 1672, graduated BA in 1677, and was elected fellow of University College the following year. Proceeding MA in 1679, he became chaplain to Thomas Smith, bishop of Carlisle, in 1684 and vicar of Kirkland, Cumberland, in which county he resided for the rest of his life. In 1685 he was collated prebendary of Carlisle and presented to the vicarage of Stanwix, resigning that living in 1688 when Richard Graham, Viscount Preston, a staunch tory with Jacobite leanings, presented him to the rectory of Arthuret. Eleven years later Bishop Smith asked him to accept the vicarage of Penrith as well, and he held both livings in plurality until his death. Within a few months of taking up his Penrith parish, he married on 30 May 1700 Lucy Dalston (<i>d</i>. 1733), the eldest daughter of the late Christopher Dalston who had been lieutenant-governor of Carlisle in 1697.<br>
<br>Todd accumulated the degrees BD and DD in 1692 and was a man of wide intellectual interests. He contributed to Moses Pitt's <span class="italic">English Atlas</span>; assisted John Walker in his <span class="italic">Sufferings of the Clergy</span>, John Stevens in his additions to Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon</span>, and Henry Wharton in his <span class="italic">Anglia sacra</span>; furnished Edmund Gibson with information for his 1698 edition of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, and provided Edward Bernard with an account of several Cumbrian manuscript collections for his two-volume catalogue of English and Irish manuscripts, published in Oxford in 1697. As well as these contributions to the works of others he delivered papers to the Royal Society, translated into English works from Latin and Greek, and published several poems. Above all, however, he was a keen antiquary with a particular interest in the ecclesiastical history of his native county. His manuscript writings included &#145;An historical description of the bishoprick of Carlisle&#146;, the consummation of a lifetime's research, but which in spite of an ambition to that end, he never published &#145;for the most obvious of all reasons, namely waiting for further materials&#146;  (Nicolson and Burn, 1.iii). Although the local historian Benjamin Nightingale considered in 1911 that the value of Todd's work was diminished by his ecclesiastical bias and carelessness in his facts and dates  (Nightingale, 1.437), this and Todd's other manuscripts relating to the city, diocese, and cathedral of Carlisle were sources which local ecclesiastical writers relied upon until the twentieth century.<br>
<br>A resolute high-church tory, Todd was frequently in controversy with the forceful William Nicolson, who became bishop of Carlisle in 1702. Their initial animosity predated Nicolson's shift from tory to whig, and was originally due to jealousy between fellow antiquaries and probably also to professional rivalry. After several rather petty squabbles, he and the absentee dean, Francis Atterbury, questioned the bishop's right of visitation, insisting that the cathedral statutes upon which Nicolson relied were invalid. On 6 February 1708 the court of common pleas upheld their contention, but not before Todd had been excommunicated by his diocesan. It was, however, a pyrrhic victory, for the ecclesiastical establishment, alarmed by the limitations placed upon episcopal authority, hastened to secure a parliamentary bill to re-establish their right of visitation. After its passage the sentence of excommunication was removed.<br>
<br>A generous benefactor and an energetic cleric, Todd undertook extensive improvements to the church at Arthuret in 1700, and St Andrew's, Penrith, was almost entirely rebuilt during his incumbency. Bibliophile as well as antiquary (he had a library of some 800 volumes among which were many fine editions) he was also, with Bishop Smith and Arthur Savage, one of those who towards the end of the seventeenth century re-established the dean and chapter library which had perished amid the disasters of the siege of Carlisle in 1644&#150;5. Todd was buried at St Mary's Abbey, Carlisle, on 13 September 1728. His personal estate was valued at &pound;1229 16<i>s</i>. All his books and manuscripts were sold by his widow in accordance with instructions contained in her late husband's will.<br>
