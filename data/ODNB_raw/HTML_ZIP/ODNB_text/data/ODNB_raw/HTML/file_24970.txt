<span class="headword">Scrymgeour, Sir  James, of Dudhope</span>  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1612), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of John Scrymgeour of Dudhope (<i>d</i>. 1568) and his wife, a member of the family of Campbell of Auchinbreck. On his father's death in November 1568 Scrymgeour succeeded to the hereditary offices of constable of nearby Dundee and standard-bearer of Scotland. The latter office was ratified to him by the privy council in 1592, and by parliament in 1594 and 1600.<br>
<br>During the Marian civil war Scrymgeour supported the king's party. From at least the early 1570s to the early 1590s he was linked to the Lyon family, which was powerful in Angus (Forfarshire), and he also supported the Ruthven raiders. Consequently on 23 January 1584 he was ordered into exile, and on 21 April following he was one of the rebel leaders charged to surrender Stirling Castle to the king. However, once King James took personal control of the government in 1585, Scrymgeour, like many others, turned to royal service. He had been charged with several crimes in the late 1570s and 1580s, but his conduct did not go beyond what was generally regarded as acceptable, and his reputation for violence has been exaggerated by some historians. Moreover, the very fact that the king employed him from the mid-1580s suggests a greater degree of self-restraint, since incurably violent nobles were increasingly excluded from power. As early as 1587 Scrymgeour received a grant for good service. In 1589 he held Fintry Castle against the Brig o' Dee rebels, acted as a commissioner to the general assembly of the kirk, and was sent to Denmark to help arrange James's marriage, witnessing the subsequent contract. For such services he won the king's trust, and about 1590 he was knighted. Scrymgeour's reliability and solid protestant credentials brought him many other appointments. He was at various times a collector of taxes, a commissioner against Jesuits, an overseer of parliamentary elections, a commissioner to hold parliament, and a juror at important state trials. He helped bear the pall at Prince Henry's baptism in 1594. In 1597 he was again a commissioner to the general assembly. A commissioner for the union in 1604, between 1605 and 1612 he frequently attended the privy council.<br>
<br>Scrymgeour was also a figure of considerable local importance in Angus, thanks to his estates there and his office of constable of Dundee, and he devoted much effort to maintaining and enhancing his position. He was admitted a burgess of Dundee in 1576 and from 1588 was frequently provost of the burgh, in which position he actively supported both the interests of individual burgesses and those of the city as a whole. For example, he took a prominent part in defending Dundee's rights against the burgh of Perth in their battle for control of the trade of the Water of Tay. His local power also involved him in burgh politics, as when in 1604 he successfully disputed a burgh election on the ground that it was illegal.<br>
<br>Scrymgeour married twice. His first marriage (for which there is a contract of 13 June 1565) was to Margaret Carnegie (<i>d</i>. 1576), a daughter of Sir Robert Carnegie of Kinnaird. She was the mother of all Scrymgeour's children&#151;Elspeth, Margaret, John, and Catherine. She died on 9 January 1576, and he was contracted on 23 August 1576 to Magdalene Livingstone, daughter of Alexander, fifth Lord Livingstone, and married her in 1577; she outlived her husband. Sir James Scrymgeour died at Holyroodhouse Abbey, Edinburgh, on 13 July 1612.<br>
<br>His only son and heir, <a name="cosubject_24971"></a><span class="headword">John Scrymgeour</span>, first Viscount Dudhope  (<em>d.</em> 1643)<span class="occ"></span>, was a resolute royalist from the very beginning of the covenanters' revolution. He attended every parliament until the covenanting rebellion, and was a lord of the articles in three out of four of them&#151;in 1612, 1621, and 1633. King James stayed at his house on 20 May 1617 during his visit to Scotland, and Scrymgeour was knighted by 1620. In 1630 and 1631 he was appointed a commissioner for surveying the laws of Scotland, and in 1634 he was appointed to the high commission. On 1 May 1627 he was charged with sheltering James Seton, a Jesuit priest. It is not clear if Scrymgeour was a lifelong Roman Catholic, but some of his actions are consistent with this possibility. In the 1621 parliament he voted in favour of the five articles of Perth and on 1 February 1639 he refused to sign the covenant. One of the &#145;resolutes&#146; who supported the king in 1639, Scrymgeour was created Viscount Dudhope when Charles I visited Scotland in 1641. In September 1596 he married Margaret, daughter of Sir David Seton of Parbroath, formerly comptroller of Scotland, with whom he had nine children. He died on 7 March 1643. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_24970"></a><span class="headword">James Scrymgeour</span>, second Viscount Dudhope  (<em>d.</em> 1644), <span class="occ">covenanter and military leader</span>, served in parliament and was appointed to the committee of estates in 1643, and when the covenanters decided to support the English parliamentarians he was appointed a colonel of the Forfarshire foot. On 2 July 1644 he fought at Marston Moor and received a wound from which he died three weeks later. Scrymgeour was admitted a burgess of Dundee on 9 July 1619. He inherited from his father a quarrel with the city of Dundee over his family's rights to hold the first fair of Dundee (first granted in 1384), and over other issues ranging from his contributions to the minister's salary to his attempts to establish a burgh of barony that would challenge the city's trading and industrial privileges. He married (contract, 4 August 1618) Isabella Ker, daughter of Robert, first earl of Roxburghe, with whom he had five children. He died on 23 July 1644, and his widow died after 29 September 1659.<br>
<br>Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_24972"></a><span class="headword">John Scrymgeour</span>, first earl of Dundee  (<em>d.</em> 1668)<span class="occ"></span>, became a royalist leader and supporter of Charles II. But after his father's death he remained a covenanter until the engagement between the Scots and Charles I in 1648, after which he served as a colonel of horse in the army that was defeated by Cromwell at Preston. He was treated as a &#145;malignant&#146; in 1649, and in 1650 became a royalist, with an important role in an aborted royalist coup in October 1650. He fought for Charles II at Worcester in 1651 and escaped, then fought again in Middleton's rising in 1654 and was captured. In 1659 he was still a prisoner in Scotland. At the Restoration he was made a privy councillor, and was created earl of Dundee on 8 September 1660. His lands were recovered from the forfeited estates of the marquess of Argyll, but in 1666 both his lands and offices, including the constableship of Dundee, were seized for debt. In 1644 Lord Dudhope married Anna Ramsay, daughter of William, first earl of Dalhousie; they had no children. He died on 23 June 1668. In the absence of direct male heirs his lands reverted to the crown and his titles lapsed: they were successfully claimed in 1952 (Dudhope) and 1953 (Dundee). His widow survived him and remarried on 13 October 1670.<br>
