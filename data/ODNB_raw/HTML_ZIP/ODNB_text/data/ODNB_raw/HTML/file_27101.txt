<span class="headword">Teesdale, Sir  Christopher Charles</span>  (1833&#150;1893), <span class="occ">army officer and courtier</span>, was the son of Lieutenant-General Henry George Teesdale (1799&#150;1871), of South Bersted, Sussex, and Rose Budd Dobree of Guernsey. He was born at Grahamstown, Cape Colony, on 1 June 1833. He entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in May 1848, and received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 18 June 1851. He went to Corfu in 1852, was promoted to first lieutenant on 22 April 1853, and in 1854 was appointed aide-de-camp to Colonel William Fenwick Williams, British commissioner with the Turkish army in Asia Minor during the Crimean War.<br>
<br>Teesdale, with Dr Humphry Sandwith, another member of the British commissioner's staff, accompanied Williams to Erzurum, and thence to Kars, where they arrived on 24 September 1854, a year before it was besieged by the Russian army. Williams returned to the headquarters of the Turkish army at Erzurum, leaving Teesdale at Kars to establish what discipline and order he could. During the whole winter Teesdale, aided by his interpreter, a Mr Zohrab, worked incessantly to secure the well-being of the troops. Support having arrived at Kars in March 1855, Teesdale returned to Erzurum, rejoined Williams, and was made a major in the Turkish army. In a letter from the Foreign Office dated 7 March 1855, the British government commended Teesdale's efforts to avert a repetition of the previous year's famine at the Kars garrison.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1855 a courier from Colonel Henry Atwell Lake informed Williams of the formidable Russian army assembled at Gumri, and the indication of a speedy advance upon Kars. On the following day Teesdale started with Williams and Sandwith for Kars, arriving there on 7 June. On the 9th Teesdale, with Zohrab his interpreter, went to his post at the Tahmasp batteries, and on the 12th he made a reconnaissance of the Russian camp. On the 16th the Russians, 25,000 strong, attacked early in the morning, but were repulsed by artillery fire. Two days later the Russians established a blockade of Kars, and shortly afterwards intercepted communication with Erzurum. The garrison of Kars was continually occupied in skirmishes with the enemy, and in the task of strengthening the fortifications. On 7 August an attack was made by the Russians, who were again beaten off.<br>
<br>Teesdale lived in Tahmasp Tabia with General Kmety, a Hungarian soldier for whom he acted as chief of staff. He was constantly engaged in harassing the Cossacks with parties of riflemen, or in menacing and attacking the Russian cavalry with a company of rifles and a couple of guns. In September the weather deteriorated, provisions grew scarce, cholera broke out, and desertions became frequent. At 4 a.m. on 29 September the Russian general, Muravyov, attacked the heights above Kars and on the opposite side of the river. At Tahmasp the advance was heard and preparations made to meet it. The guns were charged with grapeshot. Teesdale, returning from his rounds, flung himself into the most exposed battery in the redoubt, Yuksek Tabia, the key of the position. The Russians advanced steadily to effect a surprise; but they were received with crushing artillery fire. Some Russian troops penetrated the defences, but Teesdale assisted in organizing the defence, rallied his Turkish gunners, and the Russians were denied success. He prevented Turkish troops from massacring the Russian wounded, and he led two bayonet charges against advancing Russians. The battle of Kars lasted seven and a half hours. Near midday the Russians were driven off in great disorder but, having failed to capture Kars, resumed its siege.<br>
<br>Teesdale, who was hit by a piece of spent shell and received a severe contusion, was most favourably mentioned in dispatches. On 12 October General Williams wrote: &#145;My aide-de-camp, Teesdale, had charge of the central redoubt and fought like a lion.&#146; After the battle Teesdale was decorated with the third class of the order of the Mejidiye, and promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Turkish army.<br>
<br>Cholera, famine, and severe cold debilitated the garrison and there were nightly desertions. Selim Pasha's large army was expected in November to relieve the besieged troops, but never came. On 24 November 1855 it was considered impossible to hold out any longer, and Teesdale was sent with a flag of truce to the Russian camp to arrange for a meeting of the generals and to discuss terms of capitulation; these were arranged the following day, and on the 28th the garrison laid down its arms, and Teesdale and the other English officers became prisoners of war. They were hospitably treated by the Russians, and started on 30 November for Tiflis, which they reached on 8 December. In January 1856 Teesdale accompanied General Williams to Ryazan, about 180 miles from Moscow. After having been presented to the tsar in March, they were given their liberty and returned to England.<br>
<br>Teesdale was made a CB on 21 June 1856, though still a lieutenant of Royal Artillery. He was also made an officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, received the medal for Kars, and on 25 September 1857 was awarded the Victoria Cross for acts of bravery at the battle of 29 September 1855. He was also decorated by the tsar.<br>
<br>From 1856 to 1859 Teesdale continued to serve as aide-de-camp to Williams, who had been appointed commandant of the Woolwich district. On 1 January 1858 he was promoted to be second captain in the Royal Artillery, and on the 15th of the same month to be brevet major in the army for distinguished service in the field. His gallantry recommended him to the prince consort, who was seeking to surround his eldest son with good influences, and on 9 November 1858 he was appointed equerry to the prince of Wales, a position which he held for thirty-two years. From 1859 to 1864 he was again aide-de-camp to Williams during his term of office as inspector-general of artillery at headquarters in London. He continued to rise in the army, becoming regimental colonel in 1882 and major-general in 1887. He was appointed aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria in 1877, and in 1887, on the occasion of the queen's jubilee, he was made KCMG.<br>
<br>In 1890 Teesdale resigned the appointment of equerry to the prince of Wales, and was appointed master of the ceremonies and extra equerry to the prince, positions which he held until his death. He retired from the army active list with a pension on 22 April 1892. He died, unmarried, on 1 November 1893 at his home, The Ark, South Bersted, Sussex, from a paralytic stroke, a few days after his return from a small estate he had in Germany. He was buried on 4 November in South Bersted churchyard.<br>
