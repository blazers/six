<span class="headword">Aufr&egrave;re,  George Ren&eacute;</span>  (1715&#150;1801), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born on 7 November 1715 in Suffolk Street, near Charing Cross, London, the youngest of the five children of the Revd Israel Antoine Aufr&egrave;re (1667&#150;1758), the minister of the Savoy church, and Sarah Amsincq, the daughter of a wealthy Amsterdam merchant. His paternal grandfather was chased out of France after the revocation of the edict of Nantes (1685) for being a follower of Calvin; he moved to Holland and later, in 1700, to England. Aufr&egrave;re spent his childhood in Suffolk Street until 1724, when his family moved to Conduit Street and one year later to Poland Street, in Soho. In 1728 his father became the minister of the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace. In 1734 he was apprenticed to William Smith, a linen draper in Cornhill and one of the City's principal merchants. After his apprenticeship, he became a junior partner in the firm and, as such, managed its daily cloth-trading operations, overseeing the work of the apprentices and clerks and the moves to Leadenhall Street and later to Mincing Lane. And he expanded the business into new markets, supplying the African forts with English arms and ammunition and Indian cloth goods. In 1746 he married Arabella Bate (1720&#150;1804), a daughter of William Bate of Foston, Derbyshire, and a niece of the eighth countess of Exeter. She was rumoured to have brought &pound;90,000 to the marriage, but it is more likely to have been &pound;9000.<br>
<br>Two years after Smith's death Aufr&egrave;re joined forces with John Sargent (1714&#150;1791), a cousin by marriage, and from 1754 the two men conducted a profitable cloth-trading business out of Mincing Lane. Aufr&egrave;re also served as one of the Admiralty's fourteen commissioners for the sale of French prizes, responsible for the sale of enemy ships and goods captured by the British between 1756 and 1764. He was a director of the London Assurance Company from 1761 to 1777. He represented Liverpool on the nine-man board that governed the newly formed company of merchants trading to Africa in 1764&#150;5 and he sat on the committee of the lieutenancy for the City of London.<br>
<br>Governmental work consumed a greater share of Aufr&egrave;re's time as the 1760s progressed. His direct involvement in parliament began in January 1765 when, backed by his wife's cousin the ninth earl of Exeter, he entered the Commons as the representative for Exeter's home town, Stamford in Lincolnshire. In parliament he sided with Rockingham's whigs and, even after Rockingham's fall, continued to support their causes. As a friend of the opposition, he voted against the government on such issues as the land tax question in February 1767, the <i>nullum tempus</i> issue in February 1768, and Glynn's motion to inquire into the administration of justice in 1770. He left parliament in 1774.<br>
<br>In 1767, by which time Aufr&egrave;re had retired from trade, George III appointed him a gentleman of the privy chamber. He had handed over the Mincing Lane operation to Sargent and retreated to the magnificent Chelsea mansion and gardens that had once been the home of Sir Robert Walpole and which he had purchased in 1759. Surrounded by a widely acclaimed collection of paintings and statues that he and Joshua Reynolds assembled (contemporaries considered it one of the best private collections in Britain at the end of the eighteenth century), Aufr&egrave;re supervised the affairs of the London Assurance, supported the many exploratory schemes of his nephew Sir Joseph Banks, struggled to extricate himself from the snares of bankrupted friends such as Sir George Colebrooke, and monitored the activities sponsored by the London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, of which he was a member. He died at his home, Walpole House in Chelsea, on 7 January 1801; his remains were &#145;interred in a decent but private manner&#146;. A life interest in his estate went to his wife, who died three years later. His only daughter, Sophia, having died in 1786, the residue of the estate then passed to her husband, Charles Anderson Pelham, Baron Yarborough (1749&#150;1823), in trust for their sons. The extensive art collection was moved to Brocklesby Park, in northern Lincolnshire, where a special gallery was built to house it.<br>
