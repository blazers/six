<span class="headword">Bindon,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1690&#150;1765), <span class="occ">portrait painter and architect</span>, was the fourth son of David Bindon (<i>d</i>. 1733) of Cloony, co. Clare, and his wife, Dorothy Burton, the daughter of Samuel Burton of Buncraggy, co. Clare, Ireland. Bindon's father had been member of the Irish parliament for Ennis, co. Clare, a seat the family partially controlled, and he was a substantial land owner in co. Clare. In 1713 Bindon is recorded as studying at the academy in Great Queen Street, London, where Sir Godfrey Kneller was governor. He studied painting and architecture in Italy and on his return to Ireland worked as a portrait painter and architect. Bindon was a scholar, he owned a notable library, and counted among his friends Jonathan Swift, whose portrait he painted several times between 1735 and 1740 (National Gallery of Ireland and St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and Howth Castle, co. Dublin). In connection with this portrait an epistle, in Latin verse, was addressed to Bindon by William Dunkin: &#145;Epistola ad Franciscum Bindonum&#146;. Of this an English poetical version was published in 1740, <span class="italic">An epistle to Mr. Bindon, occasioned by his painting a picture of the Rev. Dr. Swift, dean of St. Patrick's</span>. Through his social and scholarly connections he received commissions to paint Lionel, first duke of Dorset, lord lieutenant of Ireland (1734); Lord Clare (1740); Hugh Boulter, archbishop of Armagh (1742; TCD); Richard Baldwin, provost of Trinity College, Dublin (1747; TCD); Eaton Stannard, recorder of Dublin (1747); Dr Patrick Delany, dean of Down; and Charles Cobbe, archbishop of Dublin. Work by Bindon was frequently engraved by James McArdell (1728/9&#150;1765), Andrew Miller (<i>fl</i>. 1737&#150;1763), and John Brooks (<i>fl</i>. 1730&#150;1756), and his portraits of Swift, Archbishop Boulter, Charles Cobbe, Brigadier-General Richard St George, Henry Singleton, chief justice of Ireland, and Hercules Rowley MP were all published in Dublin. Bindon executed small-scale portraits in oils on copper such as his portrait of Turlough O'Carolan, the composer and harpist (National Gallery of Ireland), and enamel miniature portraits.<br>
<br>Bindon's portraits are stiff and awkwardly posed: his reputation as a painter was based on the lack of competition rather than on his skill. However he enjoyed the esteem of his fellow painters and in 1733 he was presented with the freedom of the Guild of St Luke the Evangelist, the Cutlers, Painter&#150;Stainers and Stationery Company of Dublin. Bindon taught painting and he is known to have had the portrait painter Charles Exshaw (<i>fl</i>. 1749&#150;1771) as a pupil.<br>
<br>The attribution of much of Bindon's architectural work is problematical. His name has been linked with many buildings in Ireland, but the buildings firmly attributed to him are his country houses in co. Kilkenny. Bindon designed Bessborough (<i>c</i>.1744) for Brabazon Ponsonby, first earl of Bessborough; Woodstock (<i>c</i>.1745) for Sir Edward Fownes (now a ruin); and Castle Morres (dem.). Bindon's architectural style is related to the work of the German architect Richard Castle, who was the leading architect of his day in Ireland. Bindon collaborated with Castle during the 1740s and he probably completed Russborough, co. Wicklow, after Castle's death in 1751. As with his portrait painting, his buildings confirm Bindon's status as a gentleman-amateur rather than an innovative professional. He was listed as a subscriber to John Aheron's <span class="italic">General Treatise on Architecture</span> published in Dublin in 1754.<br>
<br>In 1750 Bindon had been granted an annual government pension of &pound;100 which was a rare honour for a painter. By 1758 he had become slightly blind and he gave up painting. On the death of his elder brother <a name="cosubject_46408"></a><span class="headword">David Bindon</span>  (<em>c.</em>1690&#150;1761), <span class="occ">writer</span> on trade and commerce and author of two tracts on Wood's coinage, Bindon became member of parliament for Ennis, co. Clare, and inherited more of his family estates in co. Clare. In 1762 he was made a freeman of Limerick. Bindon died, unmarried, in Dublin, on 23 May 1765 &#145;in his chariot, on his way to the country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Faulkner's Dublin Journal</span>, 4&#150;8 June 1765). He left most of his possessions to Francis Ryan (<i>fl</i>. 1756&#150;1788), a Dublin portrait painter.<br>
