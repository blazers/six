<span class="headword">Manners,  Roger</span>  (<em>c.</em>1536&#150;1607), <span class="occ">courtier and landowner</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17963/', "Thomas Manners, first earl of Rutland and thirteenth Baron Ros (c.1497&#150;1543)")</script>, soldier, administrator, and his second wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1551), daughter of Sir William Paston of Paston, Norfolk. He went to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1550 and was sent to sea in 1554 and 1555, promising to apply himself to learning maritime skills. He served in the army at St Quentin in Aisne in 1557 and Coquet in Brittany. Fighting did not suit him. He later wrote, &#145;Hunting and hawking is good sport but deling in warlyek causes is trublesom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.182). His position as esquire of the body to Mary I and Elizabeth I was probably due to his family's long service to the Tudors. He seems to have been a man who made and kept friends as he was little inclined to faction, widely connected, and trusted. Many, including those in strife with his family, endorsed the praise of his brother, Sir Thomas Manners: &#145;so honest a man &hellip; and so wise and kind a man [with] most natural and loyal love to the head of his house&#146;  (ibid., 1.214). He stressed to his niece Bridget Manners when she entered Elizabeth's service as a maid of honour in 1589 that the courtier's role was to be &#145;diligent, secret and faithful and to be no meddler in the cause of others&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 3.9).<br>
<br>Although Manners was MP for Grantham in 1563 and constable of Nottingham Castle during the minority of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17952/', "Edward Manners, third earl of Rutland")</script>, he had no ambitions beyond the court. Perhaps he was, as he constantly said, lazy. When parliament was in session he evidently attended only to keep an eye on Rutland's interests. Although he had good relations with many women, in 1575 was thought to be &#145;wooing&#146; and in 1582 to be interested in Elizabeth Howard, he never married, assisting instead with the education of various wards who were committed to him and some of his nephews and nieces, as well as his spendthrift brother Thomas Manners. His position enabled him to obtain various crown grants and leases from about 1567 on and by careful management, lending, and borrowing, he amassed a comfortable estate.<br>
<br>Manners was always in high favour with Elizabeth, on good terms with the Cecils and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and the linchpin of the Manners family's relations with the court and central government, the conduit for public and private news and advice. More clandestinely, he was linked to Sir Francis Walsingham, principal secretary, and Sir Thomas Heneage, but how far that made him a part of the spy network is unclear. He was a strongly committed protestant by the 1570s who found sincere comfort in its faith. This did not prevent his being a cynic where court and society were concerned, and increasingly often he wrote of his wish to &#145;leave the Court to younger folk and learn to keep your plough&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.94). From the mid-1570s he spent several months a year at his country estate at Uffington, Rutland, where he offered unstinting hospitality to family and friends and enjoyed hunting and hawking.<br>
<br>Although in 1583 he was permitted to withdraw from the routine service of an esquire of the body to act as a supernumerary, writing: &#145;I shall tak my ese and wayt when I list or when her Majestie herself shall command me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.151), Manners remained in frequent attendance at court until Elizabeth's death, interceding remarkably successfully for family and friends and easing the approach to court of prominent men such as Gilbert Talbot, seventh earl of Shrewsbury, when they were out of favour. He was able to propitiate Elizabeth for friends and family. He defended his friends vocally when he felt they had been wronged but remained aloof from the problems following the deaths of the third earl in 1587 and John Manners, fourth earl of Rutland, in 1588. Manners was critical of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17962/', "Roger Manners, fifth earl of Rutland")</script>, writing: &#145;They say it is a thankles office to tell youth of their faultes yet is it the office of there best frendes&#146;  (ibid., 1.296).<br>
<br>As the political situation became more difficult because of court faction during the 1590s, Manners's letters became cryptic, advising conversation with trusted confidants in his garden, where the servants could not hear. He felt &#145;it is not good to write of these perylus causes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.204). He felt relatively secure as long as he remained on good terms with the queen, helped by his access as a courtier, and as long as he continued to be regarded by the government as completely loyal. Rutland's involvement in the rebellion of Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, in 1601 appalled him. Elizabeth sent Sir John Stanhope to comfort him and by using all the credit he had with his friends, including Sir Robert Cecil, principal secretary, he was able to prevent Rutland's execution for treason. Instead, the earl was fined &pound;30,000. In 1603 when Elizabeth was dying Manners would not involve himself in any intrigue regarding the succession, writing &#145;I will not go about to make kings, nor seek to pull down any; only will obey such as be chosen and crowned&#146;  (ibid., 1.387).<br>
<br>Manners lived in retirement in London under James I, becoming steadily more frail, his condition aggravated by jaundice, so that he was unable to ride. He died on 11 December 1607 and was buried with little pomp in Uffington church in a tomb he had had erected for himself and his long-deceased younger brother Oliver Manners. He had given a dowry to at least one niece in his lifetime, and his property was left so that dowries could be provided for the rest and lands for his nephews. He gave generously to the building and upkeep of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Perhaps his greatest legacy was the collection of letters he left, which give wonderful insights into the Elizabethan court.<br>
