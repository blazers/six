<span class="headword">Griggs,  Frederick Landseer Maur</span>  (1876&#150;1938), <span class="occ">etcher, illustrator, and architect</span>, was born on 30 October 1876 at 21 High Street, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the eldest of four children of Frederick Griggs (1849&#150;1926) and his wife, Jemima Elizabeth 
    (Mimie; 1852&#150;1900)
  , daughter of Thomas Bailey, hatter. His parents were Baptists; his father, a baker and confectioner, was a deacon of the church, while his mother gave <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes, and taught in a local school for adult education. The neo-Gothic architecture of the newly built chapel they attended had a lifelong effect on Griggs's artistic vision. Griggs attended several schools in Hitchin; he also took drawing lessons, and in the mechanics' institute library discovered the work of Samuel Palmer, a seminal influence. In 1892 he began work as an architectural draughtsman under Walter Millard, moving in 1895 to the offices of C. E. Mallows. In 1897 he set up a studio in Hitchin, and exhibited his first work, an architectural perspective, at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>In 1900 Macmillan &amp; Co. commissioned drawings from Griggs for the Hertfordshire book in their series <span class="roman">Highways and Byways</span>. This became his most substantial achievement: over nearly forty years he illustrated twelve volumes of the series, books which demonstrate his technical virtuosity as well as his visionary talents. The volume on Cambridgeshire (1909) is particularly fine. His preliminary drawings also provided inspiration for his imaginative compositions.<br>
<br>In 1903 Griggs arrived at Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, where C. R. Ashbee had established his Guild and School of Handicraft the previous year. The guild's dedication to the preservation of traditional skills and ideals of craftsmanship impressed Griggs; he took lodgings in the guild hostel in 1904, before moving to Dover's House in the High Street. Here he lived until 1930, when he built his own New Dover's House close by. He quickly made a name as an illustrator, while developing the imaginative compositions which became his hallmark. <span class="italic">Sutton</span> (1912, two variant states) moves the subject for the first time beyond architectural topography to express the spirit and history of the place. In 1916 he was elected associate member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers; two years later he became a fellow, elected to the council in 1920.<br>
<br>Griggs was received into the Catholic church in 1912, taking the baptismal name Maur. To mark the occasion he designed a bell, named Maurus, for the local church of St Catherine's, and in 1913 produced the striking plate <span class="italic">Maur's Farm</span> (1913&#150;22, five variant states).<br>
<br>As an architect Griggs worked principally on small-scale projects for Campden friends. His major architectural achievement lay in the war memorials he designed during 1919. These works, done without payment, continue to adorn the Gloucestershire countryside at Broadway, Snowshill, Painswick, and Upton St Leonards, as well as his own Chipping Campden; each was designed to be appropriate to its setting and the history of the site.<br>
<br>Griggs was now producing his most ambitious designs, towering compositions of Gothic spires and turrets, deliberately archaic, expressing his sense of the symbolic and emotional grandeur of the past contrasted to the present. <span class="italic">Anglia perdita</span> (1921, five variant states) is typical in its evocation of a lost, timeless world of spiritual beauty, visions which attracted a disillusioned post-war society. From 1921 he established his own press to prove his plates, facilitating his habit of revising past works. The progress of his skies is especially interesting, the blankness of early plates being later elaborated to richer meteorological effects. His assistant was Nina Blanche Muir (1900&#150;1988), whom he married at Brompton Oratory on 9 January 1922. Their son, John Coelfrid (1922&#150;1944), was followed by five daughters: Mary (<i>b</i>. 1923), Millicent (<i>b</i>. 1926), Hilda (<i>b</i>. 1931), Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1932), and Agnes (1937&#150;1939). This large family added to the strain of the financial insecurity of the fluctuating print market; from 1926 plans for his new home caused further anxiety. New Dover's House was a characteristic Griggs creation: a modern medieval manor house in the finest Cotswold tradition. Once installed, Griggs enlarged his printing works to produce finished etchings. A painstaking craftsman, he selected handmade papers to complement individual subjects, and designed several typefaces, notably the Leysbourne (renamed Littleworth), for the Shakespeare Head Press.<br>
<br>Of middle height, lean and intense, Griggs impressed acquaintances with his grave, quiet manner. His health was never robust, and in public he was diffident, disliking display, although he was a fluent lecturer and speaker. Nor was he always serious&#151;he had infectious enthusiasm, a gift for friendship, and an ability to extemporize on the piano which made him a valued party guest. He also took an interest in younger artists: Graham Sutherland was only one who owed his beginnings as an etcher to the encouragement of Fred Griggs.<br>
<br>In 1922 Griggs became one of the few etcher associates of the Royal Academy. He was elected Royal Academician in 1931; his diploma work was the large etching <span class="italic">Lanterns of Sarras</span> (1932, four variant states). With its great bell-towers, divided bridge, and mysterious figures, bathed in light from a delicately etched sky, <span class="italic">Sarras</span> epitomizes Griggs's combination of technical skill and visionary conviction. In 1933 he served on the academy selection committee, and the following year held the mastership of the Art-Workers' Guild. In August 1937, despite increasing frailty, Griggs undertook the <span class="italic">Highways and Byways of Essex</span>. He died at his home with the work unfinished, on 7 June 1938, and was buried in St Catherine's Church, Chipping Campden, on 10 June.<br>
