<span class="headword">Eyre,  Simon</span>  (<em>c.</em>1395&#150;1458), <span class="occ">merchant, mayor of London, and civic benefactor</span>, was the son of John and Amy Eyre of Brandon, Suffolk, where he was born. He was apprenticed in London to the upholder (second-hand clothes dealer) Peter Smert, but transferred to the more prestigious Drapers' Company in 1419, some six years after completing his apprenticeship. Unlike other successful merchants of this period Eyre did not make his money in overseas trade (his name never appears in the London customs accounts), but acted instead as a middleman, buying cloth in the countryside and selling it to the royal wardrobe and to other merchants, above all to Italians. At the same time he bought dyes and spices from Genoese and Venetian merchants, who were excluded by chartered custom from the retail sale of their imported goods in London, and distributed them throughout England. While other merchants bore the risks, Eyre made the profits. Such was his success that he was elected master of the Drapers in 1425&#150;6, only six years after he had joined the company. He was sheriff of London in 1434&#150;5, and master of the Drapers again in the following year. In 1437 he was an elected auditor of the accounts of London Bridge, and a common councilman by 1441. He was active in the latter role, serving on at least eight important joint committees of the common council and court of aldermen; in October 1444 he was elected an alderman of Walbrook ward.<br>
<br>By this date Eyre was already involved in London's complicated negotiations to buy, or lease, land in Cornhill for the rebuilding of the old Leadenhall as the city's granary&#151;perhaps it was this which secured him an aldermanry. He pursued the scheme energetically, and in consequence was elected mayor in 1445, only a year after he joined the aldermanic bench&#151;an unprecedented dash to the top. In spite of a certain timidity on the part of the common council, anxious about the costs of this ambitious project, the work forged ahead. By 1453 the great quadrangle (80 metres &times; 150 metres), with its chapel projecting to the east, was completed, much of it at Eyre's expense. But after the completion of the Leadenhall, Eyre appears to have lost interest in his civic career; he served on his last committee in 1454, and attended only one further meeting of the court after 1456. Instead he concentrated on his own plans for the new Leadenhall, giving a different turn to a building which the city had intended solely for a granary. The codicils to his will show him as primarily concerned with the chapel and schools which he had lately constructed there. Teachers of Latin grammar, of writing, and of song were already in post, with an establishment of a master, five priests, six clerks, and two choristers to serve the chapel. Eyre left &pound;2000 with which his executors were to establish the schools, maintain the buildings, and pay the salaries, estimated at &pound;113 per annum. The Drapers' Company was to administer this great scholarly enterprise. The project was a remarkable one, comparable, if on a lesser scale, with Henry VI's contemporary foundation at Eton, but unique in providing for the teaching of (presumably vernacular) writing as well as Latin grammar and song. But Eyre's executors were unable to realize his scheme. Perhaps they encountered resistance from the ecclesiastical authorities, perhaps there was simply not enough money. The schools withered away, and Eyre's wealth was used to set up a modest chantry in the church of St Mary Woolnoth, where he was later buried.<br>
<br>Eyre's energy and forcefulness also manifested itself in his dealings with his own family. He married twice, first, by 1419, Katherine, daughter of Thomas Mulling, a London brazier, and second, Alice, who was the mother of his son Thomas and who had died by 1457. In 1446 Eyre secured a well-endowed city orphan, Elizabeth the daughter of the mayor and mercer Robert Large, as his son's bride. Young Thomas may have found it difficult to establish himself in a city where his father was a prominent, and often quarrelsome, presence. Frequently in debt, by 1456 he had spent some time in the Fleet, and had to be bought out by his father. When Eyre drew up his will in December 1457 he tried to protect his estate from his son's profligacy by making his considerable legacy dependent upon Thomas's not vexing the executors and doing nothing contrary to the will. The rest of the will bears equal witness to Eyre's forceful and dominating personality, and in particular to his hopes of establishing a London dynasty and ruling it from beyond the grave. His three surviving grandchildren, Robert, Thomas, and Jane, were to continue to live in their grandfather's house in Lombard Street, under the rule of his executors, until they were twenty-four years old. Thomas and Robert were to receive their stipulated legacies only if they married women of whom the executors approved. And the grandchildren were to live in the dynastic home, ruled by their grandfather's executors, provided with food and clothing and served by their grandfather's servants. But Eyre's plans came to nothing, for within ten years of his own death on 18 September 1458 his son Thomas and all his grandchildren were dead.<br>
<br>Eyre's memory was kept alive among Londoners by a plaque in the north wall of the Leadenhall Chapel, commemorating the &#145;famous marchant&#146; Simon Eyre as the &#145;founder&#146; of the great work. But as time passed he came to be seen in a different, and mellower, light. <span class="italic">The Gentle Craft</span>, published by Thomas Deloney in 1597, provides an amiable account of how Simon Eyre, &#145;being at first a shoomaker&#146;, with the invaluable assistance of his wife and apprentices, became, in the end, mayor of London and builder of Leadenhall. Thomas Dekker recycled Deloney's fanciful tale to form the play <span class="italic">The Shoemaker's Holiday</span> (1600). But the story did not share the long-term popularity of the comparable success story of Dick Whittington and his cat. Deloney's tale surfaced once more <i>c</i>.1810 in a chapbook pamphlet, but otherwise Simon Eyre has been lost to view.<br>
