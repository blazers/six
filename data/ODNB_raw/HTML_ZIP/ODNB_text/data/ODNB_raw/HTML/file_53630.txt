<span class="headword">Cook <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Graves]</span>,  Cecily Mary</span>  (1889/90&#150;1962), <span class="occ">trade unionist and suffrage campaigner</span>, daughter of Alfred Graves, was probably born in London, but little else is known about her early life. She married Herbert G. N. Cook, a secretary, on 6 November 1909. The couple's only child, a son, died at about the age of nineteen. Following Herbert Cook's early death, Cecily lived for many years with Arthur Thomas Hagg, a professional artist.<br>
<br>Active in the labour and women's movements for around half a century, in her early years Cecily Cook was an ardent trade unionist and prominent suffrage campaigner. She later joined the information and research department of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), where she prepared weekly notes for speakers and memoranda for the use of MPs, as well as articles and pamphlets. Cecily Cook was also active in constituency politics, serving as Clement Attlee's chief woman worker when he contested Limehouse for Labour in 1922 and 1923, and standing herself as a Co-operative Women's Guild nominee for a seat on the London county council at Wandsworth in 1925.<br>
<br>Cecily Cook joined the Earlsfield branch (London) of the Co-operative Women's Guild in 1920. She later moved to the Marylebone branch where she held the offices of president and secretary. Following the break with Labour, Mrs Cook left the ILP, and from 1933 to 1938 worked as member of the guild head office staff. After one unsuccessful attempt, she was elected guild secretary in 1940, a position she retained until her retirement thirteen years later. Cecily Cook was strongly internationalist in outlook and in 1951 was made president of the International Co-operative Women's Guild. She was honoured for her co-operative work when she was appointed OBE in 1948.<br>
<br>The guild's most successful period as a radical organization campaigning for women's rights was over before Cecily Cook was elected to a position of national leadership. Nevertheless, she was an important voice in emphasizing the guild's traditional role in educating for citizenship, and became a significant promoter of the benefits of peace and reconstruction. Guild membership fell during wartime but by 1950 had recovered some of its losses, an achievement in part explained by Cecily Cook's enthusiasm and devotion to duty. Her work with the guild was characterized by her belief in the centrality of the spirit of co-operation to the democratic ideal.<br>
<br>Cecily Cook had many recreational interests, including gardening, poetry, and archaeology. She was said to be an indomitable and inspiring figure, although essentially modest in character. She died on 28 June 1962 at the Whittington Hospital, Archway, London, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 3 July 1962. Mrs Cook left little money, and probate of her will was granted to Arthur Hagg.<br>
