<span class="headword">Goodden,  Frank Widenham</span>  (1889&#150;1917), <span class="occ">aviator</span>, was born on 3 October 1889 at Green Mead House, Pembroke, the second son of Harry Francis Goodden, a photographer, of Eastbourne, and his wife, Emma Margaret Gould. His first appearance in aviation was as an exhibition balloonist and parachute jumper, and later he was the mechanic on a small airship during a flight from London to Paris. Some time afterwards he arrived as a pupil at the Hendon aerodrome and he later became an instructor at the Caudron School there. He developed into &#145;a very clever aerial acrobat&#146; at Hendon and took part in the great flying displays staged by Claude Grahame-White  (<span class="italic">Aeroplane</span>, 31 Jan 1917, 347).<br>
<br>During Easter 1914, flying a Caudron biplane, he was one of a number of airmen who performed the crowd-pleasing &#145;loop the loop&#146; manoeuvre, and on 5 May he signed a six-month contract with Grahame-White Aviation. His payment for exhibition flying was &pound;5 per week, plus prize money. The arrangement was short-lived, though, as on 2 June Goodden left to begin performing on his own account. He later claimed that he walked out on Grahame-White Aviation because the planes he was given to fly were unsafe. At the end of July the company won an interim injunction to prevent Goodden from performing in breach of his contract.<br>
<br>On the advent of war Goodden joined the royal aircraft factory as a test pilot, where his exceptional flying skills were applied to getting the optimum performance from the factory's output. He was given a commission in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) special reserve; a short time later he was promoted captain. From August 1914 until his death he made an impressive number of first flights of royal aircraft factory designs. He test-flew the RE-5 in weight-carrying and dropping experiments in October 1914, and on two occasions had to contend with fuselage fires while in flight. He was also employed in testing innovations such as the anti-Zeppelin explosive grapnel, which was designed to be towed across the path of a coming airship. When the winch failed to wind the wire back up during the test flight Goodden was obliged to snag the grapnel on an unhappy farmer's barn.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1915 Goodden made the first flight in the FE-8 fighter and on 19 December he flew a model to France for evaluation. It was welcomed by pilots of the RFC as a potential counter to the Fokker monoplanes, which had become &#145;a serious menace on the western front&#146;  (Bruce, 432). The early FE-8s, though, had a tendency to spin uncontrollably and at Farnborough on 23 August 1916 Goodden &#145;performed the remarkable series of tests that established the standard method of spin recovery&#146;. It took &#145;cold analytical courage&#146; deliberately to spin the plane, but, having once recovered, Goodden had proved his theory, and was ready to teach it. He encapsulated his ideas in a written report  (ibid., 435). He was not, however, the only pilot to discover the solution, as at the same time Sopwith's chief test pilot, H. G. Hawker, was coming to the same conclusion. But the impact of the discovery was immediate and before long pilots on the western front were using the manoeuvre as an escape tactic.<br>
<br>Gooden made the first flight of the FE-4 twin-engined bomber on 12 March 1916 and later flew the plane at Farnborough before George V. On 23 October he took up Brigadier-General W. Sefton Brancker as a passenger: Brancker was then director of air organization and centrally concerned with the aircraft proposed for operational use in the RFC. On 2 November 1916 Goodden became one of the youngest to hold the rank of major in the Royal Flying Corps, even though he had not flown on real active service, nor spent any very long time in France. The promotion enabled him to argue on equal military terms with squadron commanders of considerable operational experience, and he was thus better placed to promote royal aircraft factory planes. He could, though, be critical of these, and in 1916 wrote a lengthy report on the prototype of the RE-8, criticizing many of its design features. That year he also designed a single-seater fighter. His plans were turned over to H. P. Folland, resulting in the production of the SE-5, one of the most successful fighters of the war.<br>
<br>Goodden test-flew an SE-5 on 22 November 1916 and on 4 December he flew the second prototype. The plane subsequently underwent considerable modification and on 24 December 1916 he flew it to France for evaluation by the RFC. The aircraft returned to Farnborough on 4 January 1917, and presumably underwent further modification, as it did not fly again until late January. On the morning of 28 January 1917 Goodden flew the plane to test its general stability and loss of height in turns. At 1500 feet the port wings suddenly collapsed and the plane fell to the ground on Farnborough Common. Goodden was killed on impact and a verdict of &#145;death by accident&#146; was later recorded. After an exhaustive investigation, modifications were made to the wing structure.<br>
<br>C. G. Grey, editor of <span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span>, who had a strong prejudice against the royal aircraft factory, published a denigratory obituary of Goodden, implying that he owed his advance to his ability to show the factory's output in &#145;the very best possible&#146; light. He even speculated that Goodden, a &#145;trick flier&#146;, was killed by taking &#145;needless risks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aeroplane</span>, 31 Jan 1917). The article was in &#145;such monstrously offensive bad taste&#146;, though, that it shocked the aviation world  (Bruce, xv). Goodden was an intrepid airman, but he was also an outstanding test pilot, who risked, and ultimately gave, his life so that others would not jeopardize theirs.<br>
