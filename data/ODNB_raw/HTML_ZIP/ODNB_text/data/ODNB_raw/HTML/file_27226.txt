<span class="headword">Thomas,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ieuan Ddu]</span>  (1795&#150;1871), <span class="occ">composer and schoolmaster</span>, was born at Pibwr Llwyd, a farmhouse near Carmarthen. He was educated at Carmarthen, where he later kept a school for a short time. He moved to Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, about 1830 to follow the same occupation. Except for a short period when he was clerk to the Chartist Zephania Williams at Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire, his whole life was spent in keeping private schools of his own, first at Merthyr Tudful, and from 1850 at Pontypridd and Trefforest successively. He was twice married; both wives predeceased him. He died at Wood Road, Trefforest, on 30 June 1871, and was buried at Glyntaf cemetery, Pontypridd, where a monument was erected over his grave by his &#145;friends and pupils&#146;.<br>
<br>Thomas was one of the chief pioneers of choral training in the industrial districts of Glamorgan, and he had many eisteddfod successes with his choirs. For several years he regularly held music classes at Merthyr and Pontypridd. In 1845 he published a collection of Welsh airs entitled <span class="italic">Y caniedydd Cymreig</span> (<span class="italic">The Cambrian Minstrel</span>). This contained forty-three pieces of his own composition and 104 old Welsh airs, half of which he obtained through oral research in Carmarthenshire and Glamorgan and which had never been previously published. Almost all these airs were published with both the Welsh and English words. Many were adopted in later collections of Welsh music. In 1849 Thomas published a poem, &#145;The Vale of Taff&#146;, which was followed in 1867 by a volume of poetry entitled <span class="italic">Cambria upon Two Sticks</span>, in which his disillusionment with eisteddfodau is evident. He also contributed many papers to magazines, and a prize essay of his on the Welsh harp was published in the <span class="italic">Cambrian Journal</span> for 1855.<br>
