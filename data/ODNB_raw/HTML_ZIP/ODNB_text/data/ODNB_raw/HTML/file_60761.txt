<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Happold, Sir  Edmund Frank Ley</span>  (1930&#150;1996), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 8 November 1930 at 86 Francis Street, Leeds, the son of Professor Frank Charles Happold (1902&#150;1991), professor of biochemistry, and his wife, Annie Margaret Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, housing economist and Labour Party politician. His parents were Fabian socialists and members of the Religious Society of Friends, committed pacifists, and involved in the Youth Hostel Association. These formative influences exerted a lifelong influence on Happold and his sister, Margaret Elfrieda.<br>
<br>At Leeds grammar school Happold refused to join the school's cadet force because of his pacifist beliefs. It was wartime, and to end the consequent unpleasantness in 1944 Happold went to Bootham, York, a Quaker public school. From 1949 to 1951 he attended Leeds University, where he read geology. Late in 1951 Happold was called up for national service. As a Quaker he registered as a conscientious objector and was posted to the government's experimental horticultural station at Stockbridge House, Cawood. This gave him practical experience of building a large movable greenhouse and stimulated an interest in construction. He became a junior site engineer for Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons at an office block in Leeds (1953&#150;4) before deciding to read civil engineering at the University of Leeds (1954&#150;7), continuing to work for McAlpines in the vacations. With the encouragement of the architect Basil Spence, who did some teaching at Leeds, he obtained a travel scholarship to study modern architecture and engineering in Scandinavia.<h2>
<a name="Earlyworkincivilengineeringdesign"></a>Early work in civil engineering design</h2>On his return to Britain, Happold began working for Ove Arup &amp; Partners as an assistant engineer in October 1957. With a multidisciplinary approach to building and civil engineering design within one practice, Arup's ethos, and his work with leading architects of the modern movement, attracted some of the leading young engineers of the time, and Happold found the rapidly growing practice an exciting place. He worked on the design of the Sydney Opera House, a project which established Arup's international reputation, and he helped to design Basil Spence's Coventry Cathedral. He also attended evening classes in architecture at Regent Street Polytechnic. Between April 1959 and October 1960 Happold visited the United States to work with Severus, Elsted, and Krueger. He became acquainted with the cable roof or tensile structures that Severus had helped design in the 1950s.<br>
<br>Happold returned to Arups in November 1960 and was successively promoted until in 1968 he became executive partner of the group known as &#145;Structures 3&#146;. Early projects included Ankobra Bridge, Ghana; the science buildings at Exeter University; Knightsbridge Household Cavalry barracks in London; and the British embassy in Rome. With Poul Beckmann he established a training scheme for new graduate recruits. He was also becoming more involved in the construction industry generally, organizing a conference on education in building at Cambridge and chairing a conference at Brighton on the image of the construction industry.<br>
<br>Happold's early upbringing informed some of his most important work of the time. He developed a long-standing relationship involving more than thirty projects with the London borough of Lambeth and their architect, Ted Hollanby, creating the Central Hill housing project (1965&#150;73), and West Norwood Library (1964&#150;9), where he held his wedding reception following his marriage to Evelyn Claire (Eve) Matthews (<i>b</i>. 1941/2), a hospital nurse, on 21 December 1967. Happold's marriage gave his energies an alternative focus to his professional work, and a long relationship which brought stability to his life. With Eve and their children, Thomas (Tom) and Matthew, he was able to pursue, in his own words &#145;his favourite pastime &hellip; to travel with his family experiencing together new and interesting locations&#146; (quoted in Walker and Addis, 13).<br>
<br>In 1963 Arups became involved in the design of a new assembly hall at Bootham School and Happold took over this project. His personal satisfaction was enhanced by the understanding he developed with the architect Trevor Dannatt. They collaborated on the Quaker meeting-house, Blackheath (1970&#150;72), and more importantly on several projects in Saudi Arabia. This was at a time when few Western firms had worked in Saudi Arabia, and success there brought further prestige work.<br>
<br>When Happold and Dannatt went out to the Middle East in January 1967 they met Rolf Gutbrod and Frei Otto, the prize-winners for the conference centre at Mecca. After discussion it was agreed that Arups would co-operate as engineers on the Mecca scheme as well. Otto was the leading pioneer of lightweight tensile structures, a structural form which Happold had encountered while with Severus in the United States. He had already seen and admired Otto's work. He seized on Otto's radical structural ideas, and tensile structures became a characteristic of much of his later work. In the meantime, further projects followed with Arups in the Middle East. Happold developed a strong working relationship with leading Saudi engineers and architects which continued throughout his life.<br>
<br>While Happold's work in Saudi Arabia was arguably the most significant for his later career, his best-known work with Arups is probably the Beaubourg or Pompidou cultural centre in Paris. Happold persuaded the young architects Richard and Su Rogers and Renzo Piano to enter the design competition and created one of the landmark buildings of the twentieth century. To his intense regret, after two years at the helm in Paris, Happold was called back to London full-time following the completion of the foundation work. As work on the Beaubourg proceeded (1971&#150;5), Happold was involved with a number of other significant projects such as Kensington town hall (1970&#150;77), again with Spence; the St Katharine's Dock, London, redevelopment (1972&#150;3) with the architects Renton Howard Wood; and the City Club, Milton Keynes, with Derek Walker Associates.<br>
<br>Happold's work is generally associated with tent, canopy, and freeform tension, and pneumatic structures. Much of this work was with Otto and Gutbrod. In the early 1970s collaboration included the unexecuted design for a pneumatic supported roof to create accommodation for 40,000 people in Antarctica (1971), and a temporary humped tent for the opening ceremony at Dyce near Aberdeen of the BP Forties Field in 1975. Perhaps the most remarkable collaboration was the Mannheim Bundesgartenschau (1973&#150;5) exhibition hall and restaurant, a timber lattice-grid shell supporting a free form PVC membrane, with Otto, and Carlfried Mutschler &amp; Partners.<h2>
<a name="ProfessoratBathUniversity"></a>Professor at Bath University</h2>By this time it was clear Happold was unlikely to rise to the top within the Arup organization. His multidisciplinary interests in education and the construction process, and academic background, and no doubt the prospect of a new challenge, led him to accept an offer in 1976 of the position of professor of building engineering at the school of architecture and engineering at Bath University. There he was able to address audiences combining students of architecture and engineering in a curriculum designed to preclude the compartmentalization of the design professions which often created problems within the construction industry of the time.<br>
<br>Happold's interest in research, already in evidence at Arups, was now capable of further development. With the support of the Wolfson Foundation, Happold established a research group to study the performance of air-supported structures, and later the Centre for Window Cladding and Technology. The research was fed into building design partly through the work of Buro Happold, the firm he established in Bath on 1 May 1976. He envisaged the practice on a Quaker model, with all participating in discussions and consensus rather than majority voting as the basis for decision making. Happold was able to attract some distinguished colleagues from Arups, such as Michael Dickson and Ian Liddell. His view, as expressed in a speech to the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1992 (<span class="italic">Structural Engineer</span>, 20 October 1992), was that &#145;what I know about engineering is that it has to be a group activity. The best work is done by the most diverse group of talents who can still live together.&#146; Happold had a great ability as a team builder, and by encouraging the realization of bold ideas from young talent, he was able to attract brilliant collaborators and colleagues.<br>
<br>Even after Happold had left Arups, Rolf Gutbrod insisted on his involvement alongside them on the Kocummas project for the Saudi Arabian government in Riyadh. He also continued to be involved with the development with Qatar University, a project on which he had begun working while with Arups (1975&#150;85). From 1976 for twenty years Happold was involved in a succession of exciting projects all over the world, including the Munich Aviary (1978&#150;82); Sainsbury's extension, Worcester College, Oxford (1980&#150;82); the sports complex at King Abdul Aziz University, Jiddah; the British embassy, Riyadh (1981&#150;6); the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, and Globe Theatre, Southwark (1989&#150;96); the Diplomatic Club, Riyadh; the Royal Armoury Museum, Leeds (1993&#150;96); and the Tsim Sha Tsui Cultural Centre, Ocean Park Aviary, and Kowloon Park&#151;all in Hong Kong&#151;to name but a few. Some of these, such as the Munich Aviary and structures for the Atlanta Olympics, were developments of earlier work on tensile structures, but there were important works in timber such as the West Totton and Bishopstoke schools in Hampshire (1987&#150;90), and the development of joints for green timber at Hooke Park, Dorset (1985&#150;91). Happold became increasingly interested in developing energy-efficient sustainable buildings; some notable projects such as the pneumatic structure in Alberta (58&deg;N, 1981) and the Commercial Bank competition entry for Frankfurt were not realized, but the design experience informed Happold's work generally, as later exemplified by the energy-efficient Millennium Dome, North Greenwich, London.<h2>
<a name="Constructionindustrypolitics"></a>Construction industry politics</h2>Happold's engineering practice and teaching were paralleled by significant contributions to construction industry politics. These culminated in his work as founder of the Building Industry Council in 1988, acting as its first chairman. In 1990 it became the Construction Industry Council, an inter-institution multidisciplinary body reflecting his own co-operative approach. This strategy was endorsed as an alternative to the confrontation between clients, designers, and contractors which had bedevilled the British construction industry in the second half of the twentieth century by two influential government-funded reports in the 1990s: those of Sir Michael Latham (<span class="italic">Constructing the team: final report of the government / industry review of procurement and contractural arrangements in the UK construction industry</span>, 1994) and John Egan (<span class="italic">Rethinking construction: the report of the construction task force &hellip; on the scope for improving the quality and efficiency of UK construction</span>, 1998).<br>
<br>From the late 1960s Happold's reputation won him national and international awards, in part in response to his own determination to enter design competitions, but largely reflecting his numerous contributions to engineering and design. These included the Institution of Structural Engineers gold medal in 1992, and the Murray Leslie medal of the Chartered Institution of Building in 1982. Actively involved in the governance of the Institution of Structural Engineers from 1974, he was elected president in 1986&#150;7. He was also vice-president of the Royal Society of Arts (1991). Honorary fellowships and honorary doctorates abounded. Happold served on numerous government and other technical committees, including the Building Regulations Advisory Committee (from 1988) and the Design Council (1988&#150;94). His many talents were reflected in his appointment as master of the faculty of royal designers for industry (1991&#150;3). He was knighted for his services to the construction industry in 1994.<br>
<br>Sir Ted Happold died at the Royal United Hospital, Bath, on 12 January 1996, survived by his wife and sons. A memorial service was held at Friends' Meeting-House, Euston Road, London, on 31 January 1996. Personally involved in the design of some of the most exciting buildings of the late twentieth century, his work as an educator, researcher, and a driving force for change in the construction process marks Happold as an engineer in the polymath tradition of the eighteenth-century founder of the British civil engineering profession, John Smeaton, whom he much admired.<br>
