<span class="headword">Portal,  Wyndham Raymond</span>, Viscount Portal  (1885&#150;1949), <span class="occ">paper manufacturer and public servant</span>, was born at Southington House, Overton, Hampshire, on 9 April 1885, the elder son of Sir William Wyndham Portal, second baronet (1850&#150;1931), paper manufacturer, and his wife, Florence Elizabeth Mary (<i>d</i>. 1931), daughter of St Leger Richard Glyn, second son of the first Baron Wolverton. Educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, Portal married in 1909 Lady Louise Rosemary Kathleen Virginia Cairns, only child of the second Earl Cairns; they lived at Laverstoke House, Whitchurch, Hampshire. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>Commissioned in the 9th lancers Portal then transferred to the 1st Life Guards, from which he resigned in 1911. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he returned to the Life Guards; he became a lieutenant-colonel in 1915, and commanded the Household battalion in France. He was appointed to the DSO in November 1917 and the MVO in 1918, and was four times mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>After returning to Hampshire to the family business of Portals Ltd, Portal became managing director in 1919 and chairman in 1931 on the death of his father, whom he succeeded in the baronetcy. Portals had manufactured watermarked banknote paper for the Bank of England at Laverstoke Mill since that privilege had been granted in 1724 to Henri Portal, a young Huguenot refugee. The advent of paper money during the First World War in place of gold coinage enormously increased the demand for high-quality banknote paper. Portal was determined that his firm should become the leading manufacturer in the world, and through his immense energy and resource this position was achieved in less than twenty years. In 1919 Portals introduced the cylinder-mould process for the manufacture of the &pound;1 and 10<i>s</i>. notes. The Bank of England gave permission in 1920 for the firm to manufacture banknote paper for other countries, and by the time of Portal's death the firm made watermarked paper for more than eighty different countries and banks of issue. Another new development, introduced on the eve of the Second World War, was the insertion of a line of security thread into the body of the banknote.<br>
<br>The firm had also expanded its production of commercial paper, but in 1930 these interests were sold to Wiggins, Teape &amp; Co. This allowed Portals to concentrate on the manufacture of mould-made and handmade banknote paper. Wyndham Portal nevertheless became chairman of Wiggins, Teape &amp; Co., a position which he held until 1940. He was also a director of the Great Western Railway Company and of the Commercial Union Assurance Company.<br>
<br>A conservative and also a self-made millionaire Portal, along with a number of other prominent businessmen, briefly flirted with Sir Oswald Mosley's New Party (in its pre-fascist period). Mosley later wrote that he was &#145;well-known in a wide circle to be associated with us and to be engaged in raising money for the New Party&#146;  (Mosley, 345). Nevertheless, Portal was an astute and &#145;shrewd observer&#146;  (Chandos, 324), and he subsequently had a successful mainstream career as a public servant. In 1932 he was made a member of a commission on the pig industry; in the following year he was chairman of a committee set up in connection with the pigs and bacon marketing boards; and in 1935 he became chairman of the Bacon Development Board. Meanwhile the government had called upon him in 1934 to report upon the distressed areas in south Wales.<br>
<br>In an authoritative survey Portal emphasized the need for exceptional measures to attract other and more varied industries in a region where economic deterioration was caused by a single and depressed industry. In 1936, as an industrial adviser to the government on distressed areas, Portal was involved in the creation of the new financial institutions he had called for; and he subsequently served as chairman of the Special Areas Reconstruction Association, and of the Nuffield Trust and the treasury fund to finance the establishment of industries in these areas. His efforts were greatly appreciated, particularly in Wales, where he was given the freedom of both Cardiff and Merthyr Tudful and in 1937 received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of Wales. He was created a baron in 1935.<br>
<br>In April 1939 Portal was nominated regional commissioner for civil defence in Wales. He resigned in December and in 1940 became chairman of the Coal Production Council. In the autumn of that year he became an additional parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Supply, with responsibility for the control of all raw materials. Closely associated with Winston Churchill, in 1942 Portal became minister of works and buildings (later works and planning) and first commissioner of works and public buildings, and he was sworn of the privy council. He subsequently initiated the programme of prefabricated houses which became known as &#145;Portal houses&#146;. This made Portal well known throughout the country, and <span class="italic">The Times</span> later noted that this type of house aroused &#145;great interest, admiration, and some criticism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 May 1949), even though his one thought, according to Viscount Addison, had been &#145;for the comfort of the housewives who would have to live in it&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 May 1949). Towards the end of 1944, however, it was felt that the minister of works must be in the House of Commons and Portal left the government. Raised to a viscountcy in 1945, in the same year he returned to industry, rejoined the board of the Great Western Railway, and became its chairman. At the end of 1947 he became lord lieutenant of Hampshire.<br>
<br>Portal was a very keen sportsman, and a particularly good partridge shot. The shoot at Laverstoke became famous under his organization, and the standard which he required of his guests was exacting. He remained to his last day a first-rate shot, and for a man of his bulk was still amazingly quick. There were few finer dry-fly fishermen. Many of Portal's happiest hours were spent on the banks of the Test, which he knew intimately. Moreover, he kept an excellent stud. His association with the Jockey Club towards the end of his life was most active, for he took part in the activities of the club both financial and otherwise, which affected racing throughout the country. He was also a keen yachtsman.<br>
<br>As vice-chairman of King George's Jubilee Trust from 1936 until his death Portal did much for the welfare of the younger generation, and the benefit of his sound advice was always available to those concerned with youth organizations. He had an instinct and genius for surmounting difficult obstacles and persuading difficult people. His generosity was lavish and usually anonymous. He was a &#145;big&#146; man in every sense of the word. In 1935 he accepted the chairmanship of the British Olympic Association and it was largely due to his munificence that so large and representative a British team was able to attend the Olympic games held in Berlin in the following year. He subsequently presided over the Olympiad held in London in 1948, and he was appointed GCMG in 1949.<br>
<br>Portal died on 6 May 1949 at his home at Laverstoke. There is a memorial to him at Newtown Road cemetery, Newbury. He was survived by his wife. Having no children, he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his uncle, Sir Spencer John Portal (1864&#150;1955). A number of the tributes to Portal mentioned his sureness of touch and successful approach, whether as businessman or public servant. Viscount Addison described him as &#145;kind, clear-headed and competent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 May 1949). &#145;Extremely generous and public spirited&#146;, recalled Clement Attlee, &#145;he won the hearts of Labour by his work for the distressed areas before the war&#146;  (Attlee, 140&#150;41). Portal was widely regarded as one of the ablest of the businessmen who joined the wartime government.<br>
