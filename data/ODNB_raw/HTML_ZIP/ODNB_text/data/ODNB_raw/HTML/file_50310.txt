<span class="headword">Smith,  Gilbert Oswald <span class="st"> [G. O., Jo]</span></span>  (1872&#150;1943), <span class="occ">footballer and schoolmaster</span>, was born at Chesham House, Warham Road, Croydon, Surrey, on 25 November 1872, the third son of Robert Smith, a merchant, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bannerman. He was educated from 1886 to 1892 at Charterhouse, one of the homes of association football, where he developed the skills which later took him to four appearances and the captaincy for Oxford against Cambridge. He matriculated on 15 October 1892 at Keble College, Oxford, where he obtained second-class honours in classical moderations (1894) and third-class honours in modern history (1896). As well as representing his university at soccer, he scored a match-winning fourth-innings 132 against Cambridge in the university cricket match of 1896. Sir Pelham Warner later commented: &#145;As long as there is a history of Oxford and Cambridge cricket the name of G. O. Smith will be emblazoned on its rolls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lord's, 1787&#150;1945</span>, 1946, 114). Smith also played three matches for Surrey in the 1896 season.<br>
<br>Three months before his innings at Lord's, Smith had, as captain, led England's football attack against Scotland at Glasgow; he subsequently came to be regarded as one of the greatest centre-forwards in the history of the game. During his zenith at the end of the nineteenth century, he shared with W. G. Grace the celebrity of being known by his initials only, with G. O. often rendered as Jo. Between 1893 and 1901, a period when only three international matches were played each season between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, he played twenty-one times for England, often as amateur captain alongside and in competition with professional players from the leading professional clubs of his era. In a period of great change during football's development from a recreation to a great international entertainment, he transformed the role of the centre-forward from that of an individual striker into a unifier of the whole forward line, and indeed the whole team. Unlike later centre-forwards, he rarely headed the ball but instead relied on his remarkable balance and ability to trap and control the ball. He led from the front as captain of school, university, club, and country, scoring over a hundred goals for the Corinthian club, of which he was honorary secretary from 1898 to 1902 jointly with his closest friend, William John Oakley (1873&#150;1934), an Oxford blue and schoolmaster. Both men contributed to the volume on <span class="italic">Football</span> (1899) published in the celebrated <span class="roman">Badminton Library of Sports and Pastimes</span>.<br>
<br>Smith's last appearance for England was against Germany, then an emerging football nation, in the first international game between the two countries in 1901. After graduation Smith had become a schoolmaster, and in 1902 he retired from international football at the age of thirty to become joint headmaster with A. T. B. Dunn, an old Etonian and an earlier international centre-forward, at the preparatory school for Eton at Ludgrove, Barnet. From 1918 he was a master at Sunningdale preparatory school.<br>
<br>Smith grew up in a period when social distinctions at all levels in British society were highlighted on the playing fields. The distinction between Gentlemen and Players epitomized the dichotomy between amateurs and professionals, although economic freedom or the absence of other domestic or social demands allowed many amateur sportsmen to display their talents on equal terms with professional contemporaries. Many, like Smith, were schoolmasters, who, along with representatives of the church, the army, and the law, formed the nucleus of the public school&#150;Oxbridge Corinthian football club. Smith died, unmarried, at his home, Yaldhurst, Lymington, Hampshire, on 6 December 1943.<br>
