<span class="headword">Fellowes, Sir  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1771&#150;1857), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born in Edinburgh, was the third son of William Fellowes, physician-extraordinary to the prince regent, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9267/', "Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Fellowes")</script>. He was educated at Rugby School, and matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1791. On obtaining a Tancred scholarship he migrated in 1794 to Gonville and Caius College, where he became a Perse fellow, and graduated MB in 1797 and MD in 1803. He attended the lectures of George Fordyce and Andrew Marshall in London, spent some time in Edinburgh, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1800. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1805.<br>
<br>Fellowes served in the medical department of the army before taking his degree, being appointed surgeon's mate in June 1794. In October 1795 he was appointed physician to the forces, and proceeded to Santo Domingo with Admiral Christian's fleet. In 1804 he was sent to investigate and treat an outbreak of pestilential fever at Gibraltar. He returned to England in April 1806, and in 1809 was knighted by George III. Soon after he was appointed chief of the medical department of the army at Cadiz.<br>
<br>In March 1813 Fellowes was appointed deputy inspector of hospitals, and a month later, inspector of hospitals. He retired on half pay in October 1814. In 1815 he published <span class="italic">Reports of the pestilential disorder of Andalusia, which appeared at Cadiz in the years 1800, 1804, 1810, and 1813</span>; this contained accounts of the epidemics he had witnessed at first hand at Cadiz, Malaga, and Gibraltar. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1816. In the same year he married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Joseph James, of Adbury House, Hampshire. They had a son, Thomas Hounsom Butler (<i>b</i>. 1827). Elizabeth's younger sister married the geologist William Henry Fitton.<br>
<br>Fellowes was appointed a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for the county of Hampshire by the duke of Wellington, and was literary executor of Mrs Piozzi, formerly Mrs Thrale, who in 1821 left him her manuscripts, and copies of her published writings with manuscript annotations. He died at Langstone Cottage, near Havant, Hampshire, the home of his son, on 30 December 1857.<br>
