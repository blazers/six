<span class="headword">Steel, Sir  James</span>, baronet  (1829&#150;1904), <span class="occ">builder and property developer</span>, was born on 13 March 1829 at Buchts, Cambusnethan, Lanarkshire, the fifth of nine children of a Lanarkshire tenant farmer, James Steel (1792&#150;1862), and Marion Reid. Apprenticed as a mason in Wishaw, by the 1850s he had developed his own successful building firm there and served on the Wishaw police commission and on the parochial board. He subsequently became financially overextended, however, while building tenements in Glasgow, and was declared bankrupt on 27 August 1861.<br>
<br>Without established financial backing, Steel's business options were limited in Lanarkshire, and this probably explains his move to Edinburgh in 1862/3. Work as a tradesman and subcontractor there produced sufficient collateral to recommence building on his own account from 1869. Part of the Wester Dalry estate was acquired, and the working-class tenements built on it were the result of an integrated strategy of land purchase, estate development, building, and housing management. This integration typified Steel's business strategy after 1869, enabling him to spread risks and to change the blend of his activities according to the phase of the building cycle or the composition of demand. Further business integration resulted from his operation of quarries at Wishaw and Gunnerton (Northumberland), and from the construction of powered workshops for building materials in Edinburgh. His business acumen in making realistic assessments of the creditworthiness of business associates was another ingredient of his success.<br>
<br>Although Steel continued to build sporadically in the Dalry area until the 1890s, attention was directed from the mid-1870s towards upper middle-class housing built to a high design standard on lands feued from the Heriot Trust in 1877. The exclusive social tone was reflected in its location on the western periphery of the New Town, its classical Georgian elegance, quality of materials and amenities, and not least in the street names&#151;terraces and crescents called Belgrave, Buckingham, Palmerston, Douglas, and Eglinton. Built in the later 1870s and 1880s, the west end development was sold promptly and provided a cash injection for the third phase of development. This was based from the mid-1880s on the Dean estate and a further 78 acres bought from the Learmonth trustees in 1894, upon which large numbers of lower middle- and middle-class properties were built between 1895 and 1904.<br>
<br>Within a few years of moving to Edinburgh, Steel was active in local politics. His opposition to the proposed St Mary's Reservoir project in 1871 brought local prominence, and, though defeated in that year, he was elected in 1872 for the George Square ward, which he represented uninterruptedly as Liberal councillor, bailie (from 1888), and lord provost (from 1900) until his retiral from local politics in 1903. Steel was not an initiator of municipal projects; his main contributions were informed specialist comments on council committees where his business experience was relevant, on gas and water boards, the infirmary, and Heriot's Hospital (school). He represented the city of Edinburgh at the funeral of Queen Victoria and the coronation of Edward VII, and in May 1903 Steel was raised to the baronetcy during a royal visit to Edinburgh. He took the title of Murieston, Mid-Calder, with the motto <span class="italic">Firmiter et durabile</span>.<br>
<br>Steel possessed many influential personal friends through his directorships, notably in the Broxburn Oil Company (chairman 1879&#150;1904) and Niddrie and Benhar Coal Company (chairman), through his building business contacts with landowners, solicitors, and financiers, such as the earl of Moray, and through his membership of the Liberal Club. A United Free Church member, Steel married, on 4 August 1883, Barbara Joanna Paterson (<i>b</i>. 1857), a minister's daughter from Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire. They had no children. The couple lived at Boroughfield, 32 Colinton Road, Edinburgh, from 1883 until his death at home on 4 September 1904. Steel, who was survived by his wife, was buried at Dean cemetery, Edinburgh. His will provided for modest contributions towards foreign church missions, and to support building trades workers in need.<br>
<br>Between 1880 and 1904 Steel built 148 houses and 129 tenements in Edinburgh, a building programme equivalent to at least &pound;15,000 annually throughout the period. Steel's annual rental income in 1904 was &pound;17,428; his feuing income &pound;4734. A moveable estate in shares, debentures, and loans was valued on death at &pound;114,197. Steel's contribution to the physical development of late-Victorian Edinburgh was not simply as a builder, but as landowner and proprietor, and through his considerable control over the spatial development and character of large tracts of north Edinburgh.<br>
