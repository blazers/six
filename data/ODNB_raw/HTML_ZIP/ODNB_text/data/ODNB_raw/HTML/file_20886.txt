<span class="headword">Osborn,  William</span>  (1736&#150;1808), <span class="occ">man-midwife</span>, was born in London, and received his medical education at St George's Hospital, London. He practised for some years as a surgeon, and was elected man-midwife to the lying-in hospital in Store Street, London. On 10 October 1777 he obtained the degree of MD from St Andrews University and was admitted a licentiate in midwifery of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1783. Osborn was one of only eight <i>accoucheurs</i> to acquire this title, which was discontinued in 1800. With Thomas Denman, Osborn set up a private school of midwifery, and they taught together from about 1770 to 1782. Following a rift with Denman, Osborn lectured alone, and then with John Clarke (1761&#150;1815). Together Denman and Osborn were believed to have educated more than 1200 practitioners in midwifery. In 1783 Osborn published <span class="italic">An essay on laborious parturition: in which the division of the symphysis pubis is particularly considered</span>. Sigault and other Frenchmen had advocated the use of this operation, and in England William Hunter (1718&#150;1783) had expressed a favourable opinion on it. Osborn thought it useless and dangerous. In this volume Osborn advocated the use of the crochet in cases where the pelvis was abnormally small, citing the case he had attended of Elizabeth Sherwood, who was 3 feet 6 inches tall, and unable to stand erect without a crutch. She became pregnant at the age of twenty-seven and was in labour for four days. Many well-known London <i>accoucheurs</i> were called to the labour by Osborn, who delivered her after a long and complicated embryotomy. Elizabeth Sherwood survived. In 1792 Osborn published <span class="italic">Essays on the Practice of Midwifery, in Natural and Difficult Labours</span>, which was an expansion of his former book. He was strongly opposed to caesarean section. Osborn advocated the use of forceps, but with prudence, and in general supported non-intervention in midwifery. His preference for the forceps over the vectis led him into controversy with Denman in the 1780s, when Denman announced his conversion from the forceps to the vectis. This began a public debate which continued up to the late nineteenth century, when the forceps finally displaced the vectis. Osborn developed his own modification of the obstetric forceps, which was depicted in his <span class="italic">Essays on the Practice of Midwifery</span>. A second edition of this, which is believed to have been surreptitious, appeared in 1795. Osborn attained considerable wealth, and died at his residence, at Old Park, near Dover, on 15 August 1808.<br>
