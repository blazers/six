<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  John Cyril</span>  (1922&#150;2003), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 15 January 1922 at 7 Headlam Terrace, Barnard Castle, co. Durham, the second son of Bernard Smith, manager of an iron foundry, and his wife (Alice) Madeline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shearwood. He attended St Mary's Grammar School, Darlington, and then worked in the family business as a civil engineer until joining the Royal Artillery in 1942. It was during his military service, in which he served in India and Burma and rose to the rank of captain, that he attended a lecture on law that sparked his interest in the subject. After demobilization in 1947 he was admitted to Downing College, Cambridge, to read law. He took a first in 1949 and graduated LLB in 1950, and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn and appointed assistant lecturer in law at the University of Nottingham the same year. He became a lecturer in 1952, reader in 1956, and professor in 1958. On 5 September 1957 he married Shirley Ann Walters (<i>d</i>. 2000), a 22-year-old shorthand typist and daughter of Maurice Louis Walters, shipping clerk. They had two sons, Mark and Andrew, and a daughter, Amanda.<br>
<br>Smith had joined the law department at the University of Nottingham in its earliest days, and as head of department from 1956 to 1987 (he also served as university pro-vice-chancellor in 1973&#150;7) he led and shaped it into a leading law school, with a high standing both in the legal profession and among legal scholars. He was respected as a supportive head of department, who would always find time to talk to his students and to encourage young lecturers.<br>
<br>Despite this long-standing administrative load Smith published frequently and widely. Already the author of many articles by the early 1960s, he embarked on the major project of writing a modern textbook on the criminal law. He subsequently called upon a young colleague, Brian Hogan, and in 1965 they produced the first edition of Smith and Hogan's <span class="italic">Criminal Law</span>, one of the most successful legal textbooks of the second half of the twentieth century. It was acclaimed by students, teachers, practitioners, and judges for its clear and rigorous analysis of the law and its willingness to criticize and to propose solutions where statute or case law was found wanting. Smith's critical framework was that of subjectivism, arguing that it was wrong to convict a person in the absence of proof that he or she intended or knowingly risked causing the prohibited consequence. Smith also became the leading case commentator in the <span class="italic">Criminal Law Review</span>, and judicial decisions that strayed towards objectivism, imposing criminal liability for unknown or unforeseen consequences, were met with unremitting criticism that some judges found uncomfortably blunt.<br>
<br>Smith served as a long-standing member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee until its demise in 1985 (having first joined it as a co-opted member in 1960), as special adviser to the House of Lords select committee on murder and life imprisonment (1988&#150;9), and then as an assessor to Sir John May's inquiry into the Guildford bombing case (1989&#150;92). But it was for his work on the draft criminal code that he was most notable. He chaired a small team of academic lawyers who worked from 1981 to 1985 to prepare a report and draft <span class="roman">Criminal Code Bill</span>, which the Law Commission published for consultation. A slightly modified version was then published as a Law Commission report in 1989. The government of the day showed no enthusiasm for putting the bill before parliament, despite the encouragement of leading judges. There was a brief period of optimism after the election of a new government in 1997, but by the time of his death Smith was becoming wearied by the widening gap between aspirational statements and real progress in enacting a criminal code.<br>
<br>Although the criminal law was Smith's main preoccupation he also lectured and wrote with distinction on the law of contract (J. C. Smith and J. A. C. Thomas, <span class="italic">A Casebook on Contract</span>, 11th edn, 2000), on the law of evidence (<span class="italic">Understanding the Law of Evidence</span>, 1994), and on criminal procedure. His formal retirement in 1987 did not result in either a reduction in his publications or a withdrawal from discussions with his colleagues. Indeed, he was accorded the title of emeritus professor in residence, and continued to go into the law department at Nottingham regularly. He also continued to give lectures to judges in judicial studies board seminars, never shrinking from expressing criticisms, albeit gently, when he detected error, inconsistency, or elements of objectivism. He received many honours and distinctions, including election as a fellow of the British Academy in 1973. He was appointed CBE in 1983 and knighted in 1993. A slight man, whose hair was white from an early age, Smith had a wry sense of humour and a modesty that he would jokingly defend by saying that &#145;flattery is all right so long as you don't inhale&#146;  (personal knowledge). He had suffered from angina for many years, and was shocked when his wife, Shirley, predeceased him in 2000. He recovered to see one more edition of Smith and Hogan (the tenth) through to publication in 2002. He died at University Hospital, Nottingham, on 14 February 2003, of heart failure. He was survived by his three children.<br>
