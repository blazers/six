<span class="headword">Tovey,  Douglas Arnold Robert</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">property developer</span>, was born on 21 March 1908 in Portishead, Somerset, the son of George Arnold Tovey, ironmonger, and his wife, Lilian Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Nott. He won a scholarship to the choir school at Wells Cathedral, leaving at sixteen to work as a clerk in the Great Western Railway's surveyors' office. He later became the right-hand man of the assistant chief surveyor, Reginald Scarsbrook. On 9 September 1930 he married Norah Scott (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), secretary, and daughter of Edward Scott. They enjoyed more than sixty years of a happy marriage. In 1938 Tovey moved to Edward Lotery's company, Greater London Properties&#151;one of London's most important developers of suburban shopping parades. He was put in charge of shop letting, bringing him into contact with Healey and Baker, Britain's leading estate agents for retail property. At the start of the Second World War, Lotery emigrated to the USA and Tovey was invited by Aubrey Orchard-Lisle of Healey and Baker to join the practice; in 1945 he was made a partner. During the following twenty years Britain experienced an unprecedented boom in commercial property development, in which he was to play a leading role. Known to colleagues as Dart&#151;an acronym of his initials&#151;he acquired a reputation for forthrightness in business, especially in his letters, which abandoned the staid style of contemporary business correspondence in favour of a hard-sell line, with the important words and phrases in capitals. His business propositions justified this bullish tone, proving key to the fortunes of several of Britain's most important post-war property entrepreneurs.<br>
<br>Tovey had a remarkable flair for creating the &#145;big deal&#146;, which led him to play a major role in the 1950s takeover boom. He often arranged a large part of the business transactions for his clients, offering them proposals as a full package, including acquisition, occupiers, and institutional funding. His three most important clients were Montague Burton, Hugh Fraser, and Charles Clore. Burton had been one of the pioneers of leaseback finance, in which properties were sold to financial institutions to realize their value, while being simultaneously leased back to their occupiers on very long, fixed rent, leases. During the early 1950s Tovey applied this technique on behalf of Fraser and Clore to acquire entire companies that were rich in property assets. Tovey had the original idea for Clore's acquisition of the J. Sears Trueform Boot Company in 1953, establishing Clore as the leading figure of the takeover boom. This chain owned some 800 shops, the value of which was quickly realized via sale and leaseback deals, providing Clore with &pound;10 million for further takeovers, many of which Tovey also arranged. In September 1960 Clore sent Tovey, in company with Clore's right-hand man, Leonard Sainer, to New York to purchase the biggest skyscraper he could find. He bought, from the legendary American developer Bill Zeckendorf senior, 40 Wall Street, a 71 storey, 1 million sq. ft block which, at the time, was the tallest on Wall Street.<br>
<br>In the same year, while crossing the Atlantic, Tovey came up with the idea for the merger of Clore's property company, City and Central Investments, with City Centre Properties, owned by Jack Cotton, probably the most famous property developer of the 1950s. Tovey believed that merging the two property empires would avoid the duplication of effort involved in himself and Aubrey Orchard-Lisle (his fellow partner at Healey and Baker, who represented Cotton) separately searching for developments for the two companies. The merger&#151;which created the world's largest property company&#151;proved ill fated. Tensions between Clore and its other leading lights, Jack Cotton and Walter Flack, culminated in a notorious boardroom battle in which Cotton and Flack were out-manoeuvred by Clore. Both Cotton and Flack died tragically shortly afterwards, while the merged concern was eventually acquired by Harold Samuel's Land Securities.<br>
<br>Tovey's career coincided with the heyday of the British property development industry, in which its leading figures were household names and lived in considerable style. This was reflected in Tovey's business and social life; he would often put forward deals for Hugh Fraser, with whom he became close friends, while on holiday with him at St Moritz in the winter or Monte Carlo in the summer. Another leading commercial estate agent, Edward Erdman, recalled that &#145;Douglas was exhilarating company. He had an engaging warm personality and an uninhibited flow of conversation and was a complete extrovert&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Tovey was also famously superstitious: his favourite talisman was a spotted Dalmatian dog which was constantly at his side. He retired from Healey and Baker in 1968, at the age of sixty. By then he owned Highmoor Park, a 110 acre estate near Henley-on-Thames, and a house in the Bishop's Avenue, Hampstead. However, he continued to lunch at Claridge's once a week, arriving in his chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. He died at the Dunedin Hospital, Bath Road, Reading, on 9 July 1991, leaving an estate valued at &pound;3,872,860. He was survived by his wife, Norah. A memorial service was held at St George's, Hanover Square, on 23 September 1991.<br>
