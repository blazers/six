<span class="headword">Delvaux,  Laurent</span>  (1696&#150;1778), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born in Ghent on 17 January 1696, the son of Godefroid Delvaux (<i>d</i>. 1743), a cornet in the Austrian cavalry, and his wife, Fran&ccedil;oise Chasselat. There were no sculptors in his immediate family: his early training was with Gery Helderenberg (1651&#150;1739) in Ghent and in 1713 or 1714 he joined the Brussels workshop of Pierre-Denis Plumier (1688&#150;1721). In 1721 he accompanied his master to London, where Plumier died leaving designs and models for a major monument to John Sheffield, duke of Buckingham, in Westminster Abbey. Delvaux and Peter Scheemakers completed this in 1722, Delvaux carving the figure of Time, according to George Vertue. In 1722 he was also responsible for a life-sized Hercules (Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire) for Lord Castlemaine's gardens at Wanstead, a companion to Scheemakers's Omphale; also for Wanstead he carved two vases (Anglesey Abbey) for a set of four, using as models the antique Borghese and Medici vases.<br>
<br>After working briefly for Francis Bird, Delvaux joined forces about 1723 with Scheemakers, working from premises at Millbank, Westminster. Together they provided the wall monument to Sir Thomas Grantham (<i>c</i>.1723?) in Bicester church, Oxfordshire, and large standing monuments to Lewis Watson, first earl of Rockingham at Rockingham church, Northamptonshire, 1724&#150;5 and Sir Samuel Ongley at Old Warden church, Bedfordshire, 1727&#150;8. After 1725 Delvaux carved a group, <span class="italic">Vertumnus and Pomona</span> (V&amp;A) for Cannons, Middlesex, a companion to Scheemakers's <span class="italic">Apollo and Venus</span>. Delvaux provided a life-sized marble statue of George I (1727; Royal Courts of Justice, London) for the Rolls House and, for an unknown garden, figures of Four Seasons (West Wycombe Park). He and Scheemakers also turned out a number of small recumbent Venus statuettes, including one for Sir Andrew Fountaine.<br>
<br>On 27 May 1726 Delvaux went briefly to Antwerp, where he married Plumier's widow, Madeleine (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Pauwels), in Sint Jacobskerk; she died shortly after in childbirth. In 1728 Fountaine gave Delvaux an introduction to Cardinal Corsini (later Pope Clement XII) and, with Scheemakers, he auctioned their stock, announcing that they were going to Italy: they sold several classically inspired models, probably for garden figures. Papal protection led to commissions in Rome, including two colossal angels completed in 1730 as part of a large project for the basilica of the royal palace in Mafra, Portugal. Around 1730 Delvaux carved marble copies of the <span class="italic">Nymph with a Shell</span>, <span class="italic">Crouching Venus</span>, <span class="italic">Hermaphrodite</span>, and <span class="italic">Biblis and Caunus</span>; in 1732 he signed and dated a bust of Caracalla, which evidently pleased him since it featured in a portrait of the strong-featured, portly sculptor in formal dress painted by Isaac Whood in 1733. These works were all sold to the duke of Bedford, together with a lion after Flaminio Vacca and a David, after Bernini; all are now at Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire. Payments were received between 1733 and 1736.<br>
<br>Delvaux probably carved <span class="italic">Longevity</span> for Hugh Chamberlen's monument in Westminster Abbey&#151;otherwise the work of Scheemakers&#151;before leaving London. However, he did return there briefly in 1733; thereafter he maintained English contacts through Scheemakers, who negotiated the sale of the Woburn marbles. In 1732 Delvaux moved to the Austrian Netherlands with a papal introduction to the regent, the archduchess Marie-Elisabeth, who appointed him court sculptor in 1733. He established a workshop in Nivelles, where he remained until his death. In 1734 he married a silk and lace merchant, Marie-Agn&egrave;s Colas (1698&#150;1764), with whom he had three children, two of whom survived: Jean Godefroid (1737&#150;1813) and Anne-Fran&ccedil;oise (1740&#150;85). During the 1740s Delvaux carved his masterpieces, which were narrative compositions, largely of oak, for religious institutions: they include a <span class="italic">Conversion of St Paul</span> (1735&#150;6) for St Paul's, Nivelles, a pulpit for the Carmelite church, Nivelles (1743&#150;4; now St Gertrude's Collegiale), and the magnificent marble and oak pulpit in Ghent Cathedral (1741&#150;5) which graphically presents Time and Truth, surrounded by naturalistic foliage. His interest in the antique was displayed in the monument to Leonard Vandernoot, for the Carmelite church in Brussels (1746; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), with its grieving Minerva. These works illustrate his transitional style, which hovered between the rococo and neo-classicism.<br>
<br>After Charles of Lorraine's succession as governor of the Netherlands in 1750, Delvaux worked on decorative schemes for the royal palaces at Tervuren, Mariemont, and particularly Brussels, where he carved allegorical reliefs for the fa&ccedil;ade and staircase and free-standing statues, including an imposing Hercules (1768&#150;70) at the staircase foot. He died on 24 February 1778 and was buried near his pulpit in the Carmelite church. Among his many workshop assistants were Joseph Wilton, employed in the early 1740s, A.-J. Anrion, Laurent Tamine, P.-F. le Roy, and G.-L. Godecharle. A notebook relating to his practice between 1738 and 1742 survives in the Delvaux family archive and a sketchbook of studies from baroque sculpture made in Rome is in the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, Brussels. Several of his delicate terracotta models can be found in Belgian museums.<br>
