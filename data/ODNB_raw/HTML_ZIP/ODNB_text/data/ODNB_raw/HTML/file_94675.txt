<span class="headword">Hussein Onn, Tun</span>  (1922&#150;1990), <span class="occ">prime minister of Malaysia</span>, was born in Johor Bahru, Johor (then under British protection), on 12 February 1922, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/94673/', "Dato Onn bin Jaafar (1895&#150;1962)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Halimah binte Hussein. He received his early education in Singapore and at the English College in Johor Bahru. He joined the Johor military forces as a cadet in 1940 and was sent a year later to the military academy in Dehra Dun, India. On completion of his training he joined the Indian army and served in the Middle East. When the Japanese occupation of Malaya ended in August 1945, he returned with the British military forces and was appointed commandant of the Johor Bahru police depot. The following year he joined the Malayan administrative service as an assistant administrative officer in Segamat, Johor. He was later posted to Selangor, serving as a district officer in Kelang and Kuala Selangor.<br>
<br>In 1949 Hussein resigned from the administrative service to join his father in forming the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) to further Malay interests in the struggle for independence. He became the first youth chief of UMNO and a year later was elected its secretary general, but left when the party rejected his father's multi-racial policies and joined the latter in forming the Independence of Malaya Party. He served briefly as a member of the Federal Legislative Council, the Johor Council of State, and the Johor State Executive Council, but left for London to study law at Lincoln's Inn. After he was called to the bar in 1960, he returned to Malaya to practise law.<br>
<br>Hussein rejoined UMNO in 1968 at the persuasion of his brother-in-law, Tun Abdul Razak, who was then Malaysia's deputy prime minister. A year later he was elected to parliament and shortly after was appointed education minister in the cabinet of Tun Abdul Razak, who had become prime minister. His meteoric rise continued when in 1972 he was elected one of the three vice-presidents of UMNO and in 1973 was chosen as deputy prime minister. He also served as minister of trade and industry in 1973&#150;4, and minister of finance and simultaneously minister of co-ordination and public corporations in 1974&#150;6. On the death of Tun Abdul Razak on 15 January 1976 he assumed the office of prime minister.<br>
<br>Despite his swift rise to power Hussein had emerged from a weak position in UMNO politics. His own poor health and inability to control UMNO to the same extent as Razak generated serious internal dissent. The ongoing communist insurgency still served as a convenient excuse for suppressing civil liberties, including the detention of six prominent politicians (two of them former assistant ministers) without trial under the <span class="roman">Internal Security Act</span> on charges of communist activities. At its thirty-second meeting the Malaysian bar council adopted a resolution accusing Hussein's government of &#145;the clear and wholly unworthy intention of muzzling the Bar&#146; and also of &#145;showing itself to be unwilling to accept valid and constructive criticism&#146;.<br>
<br>Hussein's tenure saw a greater bureaucratization of the economy, in which government officials were given powers to run business corporations. The <span class="roman">Industrial Co-ordination Act</span>, introduced in 1975 to extend the new economic policy's affirmative action in favour of Malays, met with strong opposition from foreign and Chinese businesses. His government initially gave in to the demands of Malay groups and Malay bureaucrats, who wanted the state to intervene in favour of Malay interests under a scheme introduced to transfer millions of dollars worth of government-owned shares to a National Unit Trust (Amanah Saham Nasional) controlled by the National Equity Corporation (PNB), which allowed Malays and <i>bumiputra</i> (the indigenous peoples) to invest in the shares. Flushed with funds, the corporation became the means by which the government sought to purchase a controlling interest in foreign companies. In 1977 amendments were introduced to the <span class="roman">Industrial Co-ordination Act</span> to make it less onerous to foreign and Chinese business firms. Fortunately for Hussein, Malaysia's sustained economic growth, in which GDP averaged 7.6 per cent for the period from 1970 to 1980, made resources available to finance the Malay investments and corporations.<br>
<br>Despite his weakened position Hussein continued Razak's policy of cracking down on corruption. He completed the latter's unfinished task of removing Harun Idris, UMNO's chief minister of Selangor, and brought him to court on corruption charges, for which he was eventually convicted. He also removed Tun Mustapha bin Harun, the recalcitrant chief minister of Sabah, who had used his position to become one of the richest men in the world. Hussein failed to stem the tide of <i>dakwah</i>, the world-wide Islamic fundamentalist movement, but he did check the further flow of Vietnamese refugees into Malaysia after some 30,000 of them had been accepted in transit camps before being transferred to third countries. When he imposed emergency rule to solve a crisis in the state of Kelantan, which was ruled by the Parti Islam (PAS), that party left his coalition government and took to the path of Islamic fundamentalism. His administration was not notable for any marked innovation or policy change, but reflected a continuation of the policies of his predecessor, Tun Abdul Razak. He, however, contributed a great deal to the betterment of the Malay community and generally continued to run a peaceful coalition with Chinese and Indian parties, despite ongoing racial tensions and trouble with communist insurgents.<br>
<br>When heart problems forced him to resign on 17 July 1981, Hussein named Mahathir Mohamed as his successor. However, in 1988, when internal rivalries caused UMNO to be dissolved, he supported a rival group's challenge to Mahathir. He died on 29 May 1990 at the Seton Medical Center, Daly City, San Francisco, six weeks after he had undergone a heart by-pass operation. His remains were brought back to Malaysia and buried at the Heroes' Mausoleum in the National Mosque, Kuala Lumpur. He was survived by his wife, Suhailah Noah, and their two sons and four daughters.<br>
