<span class="headword">Meldrum,  George</span>  (1634?&#150;1709), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and religious controversialist</span>, was the fourth son of Andrew Meldrum, dyer and baillie of the city of Aberdeen. He studied divinity at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and in 1651 graduated MA. His prodigious intellect and undoubted ability as a teacher were quickly recognized, and in 1653 he was appointed as one of the regents, or bursars, of the college. He sat upon the ecclesiastical committee, which investigated irregularities in the administration of the parish of Turriff, Aberdeenshire, from April 1653 to April 1657, and in March 1658 served as the moderator of the synod of Aberdeen. Unanimously elected by the town council, on 1 December 1658, to the ministry of the East parish of Aberdeen, he was ordained on 2 February 1659.<br>
<br>However, Meldrum was deprived of his charge by act of parliament and privy council in October 1662, and retired to the country after being relieved of his pastoral duties by the express order of the bishop of Aberdeen. Unable, in his own words, to distinguish &#145;the Difference betwixt the State of Things Anno. 1662 and before the 1638&#146;, he decided to bide his time and to accept tacitly the return of episcopacy to the church  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Sufferings</span>, 1.148). Accordingly he appeared before the Scottish privy council on 16 December 1662 and subscribed to the oath of allegiance. Promptly restored to his ministry he distinguished himself through his zeal in combating the influence of both the Quakers and the Jesuits within the parish, and on one occasion was said to have only narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of a Roman Catholic after being called out at night to visit the sick. In his posthumously published pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Danger of Popery Discovered</span> (1714), Meldrum sought to demonstrate to those &#145;who have not Money to buy, or time to read larger Books&#146; that Roman Catholicism was deceitful, corrupt and idolatrous, destroying &#145;faith and truth among Men&#146;  (39).<br>
<br>In 1663 Meldrum was elected rector of Marischal College, but he declined the offer of a DD in 1679. In 1681 he was deprived of all of his offices on account of his refusal to take the Scottish <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, and &#145;continoued silent till King James Toleration&#146;  (Wodrow, <span class="italic">Analecta</span>, 1.176). Admitted to Kilwinning parish, Ayrshire, before 21 March 1688, he accepted the ministry of the Tron Kirk at Edinburgh on 11 February 1692. Thereafter his rise in the hierarchy of the Church of Scotland was both steady and assured. He was elected as the moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland on 11 January 1698, and accepted the position of professor of divinity at Edinburgh University on 24 December 1701. Unwilling to abandon his charge of the Tron Kirk he initially agreed to serve for only one year but on the appointment of an assistant, who assumed the more onerous and time-consuming aspects of his pastoral work, he consented to accept the appointment upon a permanent basis.<br>
<br>Elected moderator of the general assembly for a second time on 10 March 1703 Meldrum used a sermon preached before the duke of Queensberry on 16 May (later published) as a set piece in which to attack the episcopal wing of the Church of Scotland, which had been gaining ground, and to refute moves aimed at the granting of toleration and the restoration of lay patronage. The impact of the closing words of a sermon, which had otherwise consisted of an unremarkable exposition of <span class="roman">Psalm 122</span>: 6 upon peace, was both immediate and electrifying. Meldrum was mercilessly attacked by his adversaries in a paper war between rival pamphleteers who published <span class="italic">A Vindication and Defence of Mr. George Meldrum's Sermon</span> (1703); <span class="italic">Toleration Defended</span>, (1703); <span class="italic">Reasonableness of a Toleration to those of Episcopal Perswasion</span>, (1704); and <span class="italic">Reasonableness of a Toleration, Enquir'd into</span> (1705). He more than managed to hold his own and did much to unite the core membership of the Church of Scotland around a common system of presbyterian self-government.<br>
<br>Famed for his many charitable bequests and personable demeanour, Meldrum died unmarried at Edinburgh on 18 February 1709 after suffering a succession of strokes.<br>
