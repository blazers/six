<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bird,  Alfred</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1811, <em>d.</em> 1878), <span class="occ">chemist and food manufacturer</span>, the fourth son of John Bird (1780&#150;1846), astronomer and lecturer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bland, was baptized at Nympsfield, Gloucestershire, on 25 August 1811. According to family tradition, he was the great-grandson of John Bird (1709&#150;1776), instrument maker, but there is no evidence to substantiate this. Of Alfred's four brothers, the eldest, John (1805&#150;1848), became an astronomer, schoolteacher, and Baptist minister. Two others, Henry and William, served in the 4th light dragoons in Afghanistan and Ireland, and the youngest, Frederick Bird FRAS (1816&#150;1876), developed unique new processes for polishing telescope mirrors, and became chaplain of Birmingham general cemetery.<br>
<br>Little is known of Alfred Bird's early education, but he was apprenticed to Philip Harris &amp; Co., the well-known Birmingham druggists and chemists. In 1837 he set up his own shop in Bell Street, Birmingham, under the title &#145;Alfred Bird, experimental chemist&#146;. On 23 October 1835 he had married Elizabeth Lavinia Ragg (1810&#150;1888) in Nottingham; because of her digestive problems, her intolerance of live-yeast products, and her allergy to eggs, he embarked upon extensive research into alternatives. In 1843 he succeeded by producing &#145;Bird's Fermenting Powder&#146; which later became better known as baking powder. This could be used as a live-yeast substitute in baking bread, buns, and cakes, and instantly overcame his wife's problems, and those of many other similar sufferers. There was an immediate demand for the product, and he went on to produce another innovation, custard powder, which contained no eggs, was simple to use, tasted very good, and yet was both nutritious and inexpensive.<br>
<br>Bird's friends persuaded him to develop these products commercially, and there was a rapidly increasing demand for them; this necessitated a move to larger premises at 69 Worcester Street, Birmingham. Production greatly increased, and distribution became nationwide. In 1855 the duke of Newcastle, the war minister, was persuaded, after carefully regulated trials, that the baking powder would facilitate the production of fresh bread for the British army in the Crimean War. Large quantities were shipped out, and in later years Bird claimed that his product had been useful not only to front line troops, but also to Florence Nightingale at Scutari. It was also claimed to have been used in the Franklin Arctic expedition. An early pioneer of advertising, Bird advertised his baking powder in 1855, and in the press from 1860. In the shop in Worcester Street, the company motto was prominently displayed:<blockquote>
<div>Early to bed, Early to rise,<br>
</div>
<div>Stick to your work, and Advertise.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>While development of the business, together with increased production, efficient marketing, and good distribution, always remained his top priority, Bird also carried out investigations in the fields of physics, meteorology, electricity, and magnetism. He constructed a water barometer described in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> (1865). He also devised a plan for demonstrating wind direction and air movements. He lectured extensively on electricity, on electric storage batteries, and electromagnetism. On a lighter note he invented a night-light which could be refuelled while still alight, and he perfected a device to keep a ball suspended on a jet of water, which he placed in his shop window as a deliberate ploy to attract passers-by to his business. It was later modified for fairground shooting booths.<br>
<br>In the course of investigations into the laws of sound, Bird, a competent musician, constructed a set of harmonized glass bowls which, encouraged by his friend, Sir Michael Costa, the eminent conductor, he demonstrated before the Royal Institution, and later, by royal command, played before Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace. Family records note his playing &#145;Isle of Beauty Fare thee Well&#146; on the glasses when his eldest daughter, Jessie Martha Lowcock, departed on her honeymoon in 1870. Always devoted to his family, he raised two daughters and two sons. Five other children did not survive beyond infancy.<br>
<br>Bird was a practising Christian and an earnest student of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He was elected a fellow of the Chemical Society on 20 January 1870, and was a founding member of the Philosophical Society. Following a long illness arising from congestion of the lung, he died on 15 December 1878 at his home at 366 Bristol Road, Birmingham. He was buried on the 21st at Key Hill cemetery, Birmingham. Pioneering work in developing convenience foods by the firm of Alfred Bird &amp; Sons was continued by his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46633/', "Sir Alfred Frederick Bird, first baronet")</script>, of Tudor Grange, Solihull. Three later generations of the family served with the firm, which was bought in 1947 by the General Food Corporation, which in turn merged with the Philip Morris Company in 1985. Bird's custard, first of the convenience foods, remains a household name throughout the world.<br>
