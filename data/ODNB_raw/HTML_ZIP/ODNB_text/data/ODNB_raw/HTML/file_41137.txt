<span class="headword">Cadoux,  Cecil John</span>  (1883&#150;1947), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 24 May 1883 in Smyrna, Turkey, the ninth child of William Henry Cadoux (1840&#150;1899), merchant, and Emma Temple (1840&#150;1887). His father's family was Huguenot in origin, and a grandfather and an uncle were Congregational ministers. The Cadoux family left Smyrna soon after Cecil John's birth and settled in south London. He attended Stamford House School, Croydon, and then St Dunstan's College, Catford (1894&#150;1900), before beginning work as a civil servant at the Admiralty in 1902. For the succeeding nine and a half years he spent all his spare time leading Sunday school and Boy's Brigade classes attached to a Congregational church, and studying for a London University arts degree as an external student.<br>
<br>Having become convinced of a call to Christian ministry, Cadoux left the Admiralty and applied to Mansfield College, Oxford, where he was accepted as a student in 1911. Here he had a distinguished academic career and established lifelong friendships with his teachers W. B. Selbie and J. Vernon Bartlet. At the conclusion of his course he was accredited as a Congregational minister and appointed as a tutor at the college.<br>
<br>Cadoux was already a convinced pacifist when war broke out in 1914, and for the rest of his life he used all his intellectual skills to produce a rational defence of pacifism. He was among the founders of the Fellowship of Reconciliation in Cambridge in December 1914. His initial research explored the attitude of the early church to pagan society and the state, and resulted in the publication of his first book, <span class="italic">The Early Christian Attitude to War</span> (1919; reissued 1940, 1982), which long remained a classic work on the subject. He went to France with the Friends' Ambulance Unit for several months in 1915; after the introduction of conscription, he gave moral support to many young conscientious objectors. At the end of 1915 he married Marguerite Asplin (1889&#150;1965), and they had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1919 Cadoux was appointed professor (a courtesy title used by contemporary theological colleges) of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> studies at the Yorkshire United Independent College in Bradford, which prepared students for the Congregational ministry. During his fourteen years in Bradford he established his reputation as a scholar, not only writing numerous articles but also publishing two major works, <span class="italic">The early church and the world: a history of the Christian attitude to pagan society and the state down to the time of Constantine</span> (1925), which was a revised version of his London University DD thesis, and <span class="italic">Catholicism and Christianity: a Vindication of Progressive Protestantism</span> (1928), an exhaustive and vigorous defence of liberal protestantism as against the claims of the Roman Catholic church. He was well known in Yorkshire as a preacher who believed that the churches should offer firm moral leadership, and as an exacting teacher and lecturer with advanced views on biblical criticism.<br>
<br>In 1933 an opportunity arose for Cadoux to realize his ambition of returning to Oxford, when he was offered the post of Mackennal professor of church history and vice-principal at Mansfield College, Oxford. Here he remained until his death fourteen years later. He continued to take an active role in the life of local Congregational churches. At Mansfield he found himself out of sympathy with the direction of thought of many of his colleagues, especially the principal, Nathaniel Micklem. While Cadoux affirmed ever more strongly his liberal protestantism, particularly in <span class="italic">The Case for Evangelical Modernism</span> (1938), a growing number of Congregational theologians were influenced by the work of Karl Barth and Emil Brunner. In addition he differed from those of his colleagues who were involved in the negotiations for union with the Presbyterian Church of England, favouring mutual respect and co-operation between denominations rather than organic union. His position was set out in <span class="italic">The Congregational Way</span> (1946).<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Second World War forced Cadoux to reconsider his pacifism; the result was <span class="italic">Christian Pacifism Re-Examined</span> (1940), in which he reaffirmed his commitment to non-violence. He continued to pursue his interests in both <span class="roman">New Testament</span> studies and in history. The former led to the publication of <span class="italic">The Historic Mission of Jesus</span> (1941), and finally to his most widely read book, <span class="italic">The Life of Jesus</span>, published posthumously by Penguin Books in 1948. His interest in history resulted in the publication of the first of two projected volumes, <span class="italic">Ancient Smyrna</span> (1938) and, in the year of his death, <span class="italic">Philip of Spain and the Netherlands: an Essay on Moral Judgments in History</span> (1947).<br>
<br>At the time of his death Cadoux was considering a book on the human treatment of animals, a subject on which he felt strongly; from early adulthood to the end of his life he was a strict vegetarian. He died on 16 August 1947 at his home, 179 Woodstock Road, Oxford, after a long period of ill health. His funeral was held in Mansfield College chapel, and he was buried in Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford, on 19 August 1947.<br>
