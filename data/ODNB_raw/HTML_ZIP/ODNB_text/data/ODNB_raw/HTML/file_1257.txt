<span class="headword">Bampfylde <span class="st"> [Bampfield]</span>, Sir  Coplestone</span>, second baronet  (1637/8&#150;1692), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Bampfield (<i>c</i>.1590&#150;1650) of Poltimore, Devon, and Gertrude (1611&#150;1658), daughter and coheir of Amyas Coplestone of Warleigh House, Tamerton Foliot, Devon. Succeeding at the age of twelve to &#145;a fair estate, and a very plenteous fortune&#146;, he was entered at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He changed the spelling of his surname, possibly to indicate rejection of the puritan and parliamentary sympathies of the older generation. At the university he distinguished himself by his &#145;very generous and splendid way of living&#146;  (Prince, 122, 125). His first wife, Margaret, daughter of John Bulkeley of Nether Burgate, Hampshire, whom he married in 1655, also came of presbyterian gentry stock, but Bampfylde was &#145;actuated even then with Principles of Loyalty to his Sovereign, though in Exile, and the Church, then under a Cloud&#146;  (ibid., 122). Nevertheless it was probably his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1260/', "Thomas Bampfield")</script>, who secured Bampfylde's election for Tiverton to Richard Cromwell's parliament. Bampfylde played a leading part in promoting the Restoration in Devon: he presented to George Monck the petition for a free parliament and raised a troop of 120 gentlemen to disarm &#145;disaffected and seditious persons&#146;  (ibid., 123&#150;4). As sheriff it fell to him to conduct the county election in 1661 at the head of his customary retinue, and his speech at the hustings exhorting the electorate to choose &#145;only those who were, and always had been, loyal subjects and good Christians&#146; found its way into the government-controlled London press  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Publicus</span>, 25 April 1661).<br>
<br>Bampfylde was returned for Devon at a contested by-election in 1671 when Sir Thomas Clifford, on behalf of the cabal, failed to secure the victory of a candidate more favourable to the dissenters. &#145;Much addicted to tippling&#146; according to a hostile account, he was &#145;presented to the King by his pretended wife, Bett Roberts, in Pall Mall&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Historical Documents</span>, 8.239). In 1674 Bampfylde contracted a second marriage with Jane (<i>c</i>.1654), daughter of Sir Courtenay Pole of Shute, Devon, and a pillar of the new court party as reconstructed by Sir Thomas Osborne on firmly Anglican principles, but the Popish Plot and fears of French influence at court brought this ministry down, and Bampfylde did not sit in any of the three Exclusion parliaments that followed.<br>
<br>Bampfylde again represented Devon in James II's parliament. On grounds of declining health he handed over his militia command to his son Hugh at the time of the Monmouth rebellion. He gave the standard negative answers on the proposed repeal of the laws against Roman Catholicism and was dismissed from local office. In 1688 he sent his son to wait on William of Orange at Exeter &#145;as one come to preserve our laws and religion and maintain the established Government&#146;, but he could not accept the transfer of the crown to William and Mary, and &#145;so far declared against these Proceedings as to refuse Payment of any New made Rates and Taxes&#146;. His son was killed in a riding accident in 1691 and it was during a visit to his widowed daughter-in-law and his infant grandson at Warleigh that Bampfylde died of gout on 9 February 1692, in his fifty-fifth year. &#145;On his death-bed he charged his family that they should always continue faithful to the Religion of the established Church of England and be sure to pay their Allegiance to the right heirs of the Crown&#146;  (Prince, 124). He died intestate, having lived for many years above his income, and was buried at Poltimore without any monument.<br>
<br>John Prince described Bampfylde as<blockquote>the goodliest person that ever mine Eyes beheld, exceeding by some inches six Foot in heigth &hellip; Of a manly and yet a charming Countenance, a ready wit and a good Judgment, and was of a truly large and generous Soul. (Prince, 125)</blockquote>He cut no great figure in any of his three parliaments and shone only on the provincial stage, where his career illustrates the problems of conflicting loyalties to church and to crown. His three children, all with his first wife, predeceased him, but his grandson, the third baronet, sat in the Hanoverian parliament as a Jacobite.<br>
