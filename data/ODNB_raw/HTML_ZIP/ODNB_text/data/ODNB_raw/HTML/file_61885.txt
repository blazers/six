<span class="headword">Poston,  Elizabeth</span>  (1905&#150;1987), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 24 October 1905 at Highfield, Walkern, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the daughter of Charles Poston (<i>d</i>. 1913), stockbroker, and his wife, Clementine Elizabeth Brockner Bewley (<i>d</i>. 1971). Ralph, her brother, was born in 1907. She lived at home until 1914, when she moved to Rook's Nest House, Weston Road, Stevenage, a year after her father's death. She studied the piano as a child with her mother and in her teens with Harold Samuel. Her early schooling was in Yorkshire. In 1924 she enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music, where she subsequently received many composition awards. During this time she met and studied with Ralph Vaughan Williams. Poston also developed a passion for the composer known as Peter Warlock (Philip Heseltine). Although she came to know Warlock very well and became an authority on his work, it is not known whether the relationship went further. In 1947, seventeen years after his death, she presented a five-part lecture series on his music for BBC radio's Third Programme.<br>
<br>Poston established herself as a skilled pianist, and Dame Myra Hess often invited her to perform at the National Gallery concerts during the early 1940s. After one performance, Poston was approached by E. M. Forster, a former resident of Rook's Nest House. With a shared love of the building&#151;the model for Forster's novel <span class="italic">Howards End</span>&#151;they became good friends. Together they fought to preserve the land near Rook's Nest, and after Forster's death Poston ardently continued the fight with help from other influential people.<br>
<br>In 1939 Poston began a long and productive affiliation with the BBC. Arthur Bliss, director of music for the BBC, appointed her to take charge of music in the European service in Bush House, London. It is believed that her responsibilities included sending coded musical messages under Churchill's orders to resistance movements on the continent (private information). This was a particularly difficult period in Poston's life, and the secrecy of the time and the immense pressure of the task caused her great stress. In 1945, on the verge of an emotional breakdown, she resigned from the BBC and returned home to Rook's Nest to recuperate. During her respite, she spent time travelling and collecting folk-songs in Canada and the USA.<br>
<br>Poston received an invitation from Douglas Cleverdon in 1947 to return to the BBC in order to help him launch the Third Programme. The two had become good friends during the war, and he believed that her background&#151;including musical skills, social advantages, and literary tastes&#151;made her ideal for such an undertaking. For her first project, a score for the first complete radio broadcast of John Milton's masque <span class="italic">Comus</span>, she incorporated some of the songs by Henry Lawes used in the first production. It featured Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Dylan Thomas, and Heddle Nash. Her literary interests led her to collaborations and friendships with Thomas, Terence Tiller, David Jones, and C. S. Lewis, for whom she produced scores for radio productions. Poston became highly sought after as a composer, and wrote extensively for radio drama.<br>
<br>In the 1960s Elizabeth Poston turned her energies towards compiling song collections and produced six of these, including her well-known <span class="italic">Penguin Book of Christmas Carols</span> (1965). She also revisited a project begun earlier with her friend Vaughan Williams to revise <span class="italic">The English Hymnal</span>. This endeavour, which resulted in <span class="italic">The Cambridge Hymnal</span> (Cambridge, 1967), involved commissioning over thirty composers including Lennox Berkeley, Arthur Bliss, Benjamin Britten, John Gardner, Imogen Holst, Herbert Howells, and Elizabeth Maconchy. Deeply sensitive to the relationship between words and music, Poston said in a BBC radio broadcast that &#145;we need as a composer needs, the music of the words themselves &hellip; without the great words, we shouldn't have the great settings of them&#146;  (Poston, interview).<br>
<br>Poston was greatly affected by the deaths of Forster in 1970 and of her mother in 1971; she subsequently suffered an aneurysm. After a very difficult convalescence she continued to compose and to work on her collections of folk-songs and carols. Surrounded by friends, Poston celebrated her eightieth birthday with an evening of music that she had composed and selected. She also regaled the audience with stories and musings on her life. In the following year she suffered a fall and spent her birthday in hospital. Poston suffered a massive stroke while working at home on a collection of Christmas carols; she was taken to the Lister Hospital, Stevenage, where she died on 18 March 1987 without regaining consciousness. She was unmarried.<br>
<br>A meticulous scholar, well respected by her peers for her musical contributions as well as her charming and witty personality, Elizabeth Poston won particular respect as an editor of folk-song and carol collections. She was a self-proclaimed miniaturist, and greatly enjoyed choral settings and solo song. Although she composed some early instrumental pieces, most of her published pieces were vocal. Poston had a passion for educating young musicians: she wrote a wealth of music for them, including choral pieces for festivals and song collections for young children. Her earliest published work was a set of seven part-songs including her popular setting of &#145;Sweet Suffolk Owl&#146; (1925). Her best-known piece was the carol &#145;Jesus Christ the apple tree&#146; (1967). Several boxes of unpublished music found in her attic after her death in 1987 indicated that she was a more prolific composer than had been previously imagined.<br>
