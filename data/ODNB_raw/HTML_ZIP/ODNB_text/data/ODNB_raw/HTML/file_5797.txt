<span class="headword">Codrington, Sir  Henry John</span>  (1808&#150;1877), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5796/', "Admiral Sir Edward Codrington (1770&#150;1851)")</script>, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hall (<i>d</i>. 1837), was born in October 1808 and entered the navy in 1823 on board the frigate <i>Naiad</i>, Captain the Hon. Robert Cavendish Spencer, to whose early training he owed much. During 1824 the <i>Naiad</i> was active during the Algerian war, blockading the coast and burning corsairs. She was then nearly two years on the Greek coast observing the war of independence, and returned to England towards the end of 1826. Codrington then joined the <i>Asia</i>, flagship of Sir Edward Codrington, in the Mediterranean. He remained in the <i>Asia</i> during his father's command, and acted as signal midshipman at the battle of Navarino, where he was wounded in the leg. As a compliment to his father, he was decorated by the tsar and the kings of France and Greece.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1829 Codrington was made lieutenant, and, after serving through the summer of 1831 as his father's flag-lieutenant with the Squadron of Evolution, he was promoted commander on 20 October. Three years later he was appointed to command the sloop <i>Orestes</i> in the Mediterranean, and was promoted captain on 20 January 1836. During the following two years he was on half pay, and devoted himself to scientific study. In March 1838 he was appointed to command the <i>Talbot</i>, a small, old-fashioned sloop armed mostly with outdated short-range carronades, yet she was so handled by Codrington as to be an effective addition to the Mediterranean fleet, and to take a useful part in the bombardment of Acre on 4 November 1840, for which he received the CB. The preliminary survey of Acre was made by Codrington himself, taking the soundings by night close in under the walls of the town. In private letters afterwards he criticized Commodore Sir Charles Napier, since he was entirely ignorant of Napier's political correspondence with Lord Palmerston, and his central role in the rapid prosecution of the campaign. His complaint had more to do with Napier's manners than his abilities, which better men than Codrington never doubted. It was a mark of Codrington's limited intellect that he never appreciated Napier's leadership, decision, and energy, for these were the very qualities that he himself so signally lacked. Codrington described Napier as &#145;excellent at irregular shore work, and a most enterprising partisan warrior, but not what I call a good officer&#146;.<br>
<br>Early in 1841 Codrington was recalled to England to command the <i>St Vincent</i> as flag-captain to his father, then commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. He held this appointment only until the end of 1842. Four years later, having quarrelled with Captain Sir Thomas Hastings of HMS <i>Excellent</i>, he was appointed to the frigate <i>Thetis</i>, which went to the Mediterranean in September 1847. In the following years the <i>Thetis</i> was employed on the coast of Italy, protecting British interests and British subjects, and acting as a refuge for displaced native rulers. Thanks to the first lieutenant, John McNeill Boyd, the <i>Thetis</i> was kept fully up to the mark, and was praised by the commander-in-chief at Plymouth when she was paid off in May 1850. However, she gained a bad reputation, and Codrington and Boyd became unpopular in the service, because of the strict discipline over the midshipmen: possibly tact was occasionally wanting. While on station, in 1849, Codrington married Helen Jane Webb Smith of Lyndhurst. They had several children.<br>
<br>In October 1853, in anticipation of the war with Russia, Codrington was appointed to command the <i>Royal George</i>, an old three-decker with an auxiliary screw. She formed part of the Baltic fleet during the two seasons of 1854 and 1855. Controversy afterwards arose as to the conduct of the fleet in 1854. Between Sir Charles Napier, the commander-in-chief, and Codrington, the senior captain in the fleet, there was little love lost. There were faults on both sides; but Codrington's conduct bordered on mutiny, and could not be excused by any provocation. Codrington had an interest in steam tactics, but his views were impractical and over-complex, and in consequence were ignored by Napier, a far more experienced and practical officer. In February 1856 Codrington moved to the <i>Algiers</i> (90 guns), as commodore of a flotilla of gunboats; but the peace deprived him of any opportunity of using them, and his sea service ended with the St George's day review and a passage to the Crimea, where he embarked elements of the army, then commanded by his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5800/', "William John Codrington (1804&#150;1884)")</script>.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1857 Codrington became a rear-admiral, and from 1858 to 1863 he was admiral superintendent at Malta. On 24 September 1863 he was advanced to be vice-admiral, on 18 October 1867 to be admiral, and on 22 January 1877 to be admiral of the fleet. He was appointed KCB on 13 March 1867 and, following the death of his first wife, married Catherine Compton of Lyndhurst in 1869. He was commander-in-chief at Plymouth 1869&#150;72, but his flag was never hoisted on board a seagoing ship; he never had command of a squadron at sea or took a seat at the Board of Admiralty. This was a reflection of his abilities for, although a fine seaman and a strict disciplinarian, Codrington lacked the leadership and intellect required for a senior command, or the collaboration of the board. His career was made by his father, whom he hero-worshipped. His quarrels with senior officers suggest that he was an arrogant and fastidious snob. In 1854 Napier, a far greater man, was so incensed by Codrington's conduct that he wished to court-martial him, along with captains George Elliot and Alfred Ryder. All three deserved censure, but the board and the government would not back him, undermining his authority and his faith in the Admiralty. Codrington died at his home, 112 Eaton Square, London, on 4 August 1877.<br>
