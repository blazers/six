<span class="headword">Crossley,  John</span>  (1812&#150;1879), <span class="occ">industrialist and philanthropist</span>, was born on 16 May 1812 in Halifax, the sixth of the eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57914/', "John Crossley (c.1772&#150;1837)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57913/', "Crossley, Martha")</script>], carpet manufacturer, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57913/', "Martha Crossley (1775&#150;1854)")</script>, daughter of Abraham Turner (1747&#150;1805) of Upper Scout Farm, Northowram, near Halifax. His father, a former carpet weaver, had founded the family carpet manufacturing business at Dean Clough, Halifax, in 1822, following two decades in partnership with other carpet manufacturers. After his death in 1837 the firm continued as John Crossley &amp; Sons under the direction of his three youngest sons, John, Joseph, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6807/', "Francis Crossley")</script>, and by the time of John's death in 1879 it had become the largest carpet manufacturing firm in the world.<br>
<br>It is not easy to distinguish the individual contributions to the success of the firm of the three brothers, who maintained an effective and harmonious business partnership. Joseph, who unlike his brothers played no prominent role in public life, is often characterized as the partner most closely involved in the day-to-day management of the firm, while Francis has been portrayed as the most enterprising and innovative, taking the initiative in the development of steam-powered tapestry carpet production, which provided the springboard for the firm's mid-century expansion. However, John's association with the firm, extending over a half a century, was the longest, including forty years as senior partner and chairman of the board of directors. During this period the firm became a pioneering joint-stock company, with the primary aim of enabling employees to become shareholders, achieving by the early 1870s annual carpet sales of &pound;1,100,000, including exports to the United States valued at nearly &pound;500,000. On his retirement John Crossley expressed particular satisfaction that for nearly forty years &#145;no dispute or misunderstanding has occurred but such as was there and then, by mutual compromise, adjusted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Courier</span>, 19 April 1879). Later, Uriah Bairstow, a former employee, contrasted the management styles of Francis, &#145;the shrewd businessman&#146;, and Joseph, &#145;a terror to evil doers&#146;, with the more sympathetic approach to personnel of John, whose &#145;great kindness and his great regard for the people and their great regard for him&#146; was universally acknowledged  (<span class="roman">Calderdale District Archives</span>, DC 1737).<br>
<br>Samuel Smiles, the apostle of Victorian self-help, commending the approach of the Crossley brothers' father to parenting, observed: &#145;when at home, he always had one of his sons near him; or when he went from home, he always took one of them with him&#146;, thereby equipping them with &#145;a great deal of practical knowledge of life&#146;  (Smiles, 238). As John Crossley later revealed, &#145;when he was about twelve years of age his father, finding that he was not making much progress at school, thought it would be a good thing to put him in his factory for twelve months&#146;, working a fifteen hour day  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 218, 1874, 1773&#150;6). He received no further formal education, apart from a year at the local grammar school in 1825&#150;6. No less significant was the influence of the boys' remarkable mother, whose earnest evangelical nonconformity and celebrated vow that &#145;if the Lord does bless us at this place, the poor shall taste of it&#146;  (Smiles, 240) inspired both an unremitting commitment to work and a liberal philanthropy, which characterized the lives of all three brothers.<br>
<br>Of the brothers, John made the most significant contribution to the life of the local community. A petitioner for Halifax's municipal charter, he served on the Halifax town council from its inception in 1848 until 1868, earning the unique distinction of serving four terms as mayor and hosting the first visit of a member of the British royal family to Halifax in 1863, when the prince of Wales opened Sir Charles Barry's magnificent new town hall. This sumptuous monument to Victorian municipal endeavour formed the centrepiece of a privately financed urban improvement scheme, commenced by John Crossley in 1851, which transformed an area of dilapidated back yards, workshops, stables, and piggeries into an elegant urban environment with wide streets and impressive stone buildings, which a visiting reporter later maintained &#145;would do credit to most European capitals&#146;  (Bretton, 18). Elsewhere in the town he constructed an Italianate model lodging house, with accommodation for fifty vagrants; promoted a non-profit-making model housing scheme, designed &#145;to encourage thrifty artisans, clerks and others to obtain freehold dwellings for themselves&#146;  (Hole, 75); and, with his brothers, founded and endowed a large orphanage, close to his ornate Gothic mansion at Manor Heath. Moreover, besides serving as a magistrate, chairman of the Halifax Commercial Banking Company, and a member of the Halifax school board, he was associated with the establishment of a building society, chamber of commerce, local newspaper, post office, and woollen market, and the construction of new reservoirs for the town.<br>
<br>In February 1874 John Crossley accepted nomination as parliamentary candidate for Halifax and headed the poll, even though serious injuries sustained in a carriage accident in August 1873 had precluded his taking an active part in the contest. A Gladstonian Liberal and sabbatarian, he also supported militant dissenting campaigns for the disestablishment of the Church of England and the repeal of clause 25 of the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, which permitted payments from the rates to Anglican schools for the education of poor children. He was assiduous in his attendance at the House of Commons and served on the public departments (purchases) select committee in 1874, but rarely spoke in debates, experiencing some difficulty with &#145;spontaneous public utterance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Courier</span>, 26 April 1879). His maiden speech in May 1874, while recognizing the value of the &#145;ten hour system&#146;, revealed his opposition to further extension of factory regulation, and in a subsequent speech he supported an amendment designed to enable the employment of children of nine years of age in factories. He resigned his seat in February 1877 as a result of continuing ill health and financial embarrassment arising from imprudent speculative investment, motivated in the view of his mentor, Dr Enoch Mellor, by &#145;an undercurrent of hope that immense public benefit would accrue&#146;  (ibid.) from the development of natural mineral resources rather than any desire for personal financial gain.<br>
<br>John Crossley appears in photographs and portraits as a tall, soberly dressed figure, with a greying beard and whiskers, a gentle bearing, and kindly disposition. He had known personal tragedy when his first wife, Anne Child (1811&#150;1846), the daughter of Kitchenman Child of Ovenden, whom he had married on 7 May 1839 and with whom he had a son and two daughters, died shortly after the birth of their third child. He remarried on 11 November 1847; his new wife was Sarah (1803&#150;1879), daughter of Joseph Wheatley of Hopton and widow of John Hodgson of Halifax; they had no children. He was a devout Christian and chairman of the English Congregational Chapel Building Society, supporting numerous chapel and school building schemes, including the rebuilding in 1857 of Square Congregational Chapel, Halifax, where he was a devoted member, deacon, and Sunday school teacher. Enoch Mellor, the minister, described him in his funeral eulogy as essentially &#145;a plain man, simple as a child, artless, unambitious of name or honours, content to do good and to be hidden behind the good he did, and to die where his work was done&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Courier</span>, 26 April 1879).<br>
<br>Unlike Francis Crossley, who acquired a country estate in Somerleyton, Suffolk, in 1861, and a baronetcy in 1863, John remained in Halifax until ill health and straitened financial circumstances obliged him to move to his daughter and son-in-law's home at Putney in 1878, before returning with them to Halifax, where he died at Broomfield, Skircoat, from heart disease on 16 April 1879. He was buried at Lister Lane cemetery; his civic funeral brought the busy town of Halifax to a halt, revealing the undiminished respect of the Halifax public for the last of the Crossley brothers, who had died an invalid, leaving less than &pound;8000, in marked contrast to his brothers, Joseph and Francis, who had left personal estates valued at &pound;900,000 and &pound;800,000 respectively. He was survived by his wife, who died later in the year, by his only son, Louis John (1842&#150;1891), a pioneer electrical scientist, and by his younger daughter, Anne (1846&#150;1925), who had married Giulio Marchetti, formerly one of Garibaldi's redshirts and subsequently a director and chairman of John Crossley &amp; Sons Limited.<br>
