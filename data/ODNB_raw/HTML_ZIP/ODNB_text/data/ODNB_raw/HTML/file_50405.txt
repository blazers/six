<span class="headword">Barr,  Andrew Greig</span>  (1872&#150;1903), <span class="occ">soft drinks manufacturer</span>, was born on 5 May 1872 in Falkirk, the second of three sons of Robert Barr, cork cutter and aerated water manufacturer, and his wife, Jane Greig. He attended the Falkirk high school before completing his schooling at Daniel Stewart's College, Edinburgh. Although his father was already in business, the business was too small to absorb both Andrew and his elder brother, Robert, and Andrew began his business career as a clerk in the Clydesdale Bank in Falkirk. He was clearly adept at his work, for when the Clydesdale opened a small branch in nearby Larbert, Andrew Barr was put in charge of its business. Barr continued in the bank until 1887, when his father decided to open a branch of his business in Glasgow to exploit the expanding soft drinks market. Barr's elder brother went to manage the new development, and Andrew and his younger brother, William S. Barr, then joined their father in the Falkirk business.<br>
<br>Although Falkirk was the head office, Glasgow was the expanding market, and Robert Barr successfully established large new premises at 184 Great Eastern Road in the Parkhead district of Glasgow, producing lemonade, soda water, orangeade, sasparilla, and many other beverages. The business grew so quickly that Andrew Barr joined his brother in Glasgow in 1892. He worked aggressively to expand its activities, so much so that by 1897 he was sole proprietor, operating the Glasgow establishment as a separate concern from the family business in Falkirk.<br>
<br>Barr then embarked on a forceful strategy to capture the leading place in the Glasgow soft drinks market. A major new factory was constructed and twice extended in 1901 and 1902&#150;3, fitted out with the latest plant and designed for efficient staging of production. The storeroom could cope with 30,000 crates, each containing a dozen bottles, and the works employed about 200 people, together with 150 horses to cope with deliveries. Advertising and brand image was important, and Barr had his vans designed with a distinctive white and gold livery carrying the company name prominently.<br>
<br>The heart of the new Parkhead works was the laboratory, where the syrups and essences were blended and combined according to formulae before adding to water. Barr personally supervised this activity, and in 1901 created what was later known as Barr's Irn Bru. When first introduced, his &#145;iron brew&#146; was one of a number of similar competing products, but Barr's was the most successful, and the formula is still held exclusively by the senior members of the family. The phoneticized name, Irn Bru, was not introduced until 1946. Barr's new product was instantly popular and was to become the foundation of the Barr empire. He promoted it vigorously and also became heavily involved in the affairs of a number of trade associations. In particular he became treasurer of the Glasgow Bottle Exchange Association, set up to collect and recycle the expensive glass bottles to their appropriate owners. Barr had pioneered the use of the screw-on, replaceable bottle top, making it even more worthwhile to keep the bottles in circulation and prevent their use by others. Barr in fact regularly resorted to litigation to enforce his ownership of the expensive bottles and to prosecute those who tried to use them and fill them with their own products.<br>
<br>Andrew Barr's rise was meteoric, and by the age of thirty he was a major manufacturer in the soft drinks trade in Glasgow. With this successfully behind him, he married Isabel Margaret Gibb, at Dollar, on 25 April 1903. Tragically, his life was cut short eleven weeks later after a three-week battle with blood poisoning and a chill, which deteriorated into pneumonia. He died on 12 July 1903 at his home, 45 Roslea Drive, Dennistoun, Glasgow.<br>
<br>Knowing he would not recover, Andrew Barr had made provision in his will to enable his younger brother, William, to take over as manager of the Parkhead works for a period of eighteen months, with an option to purchase after twelve months. This was the outcome, and in 1904 the firm took the name of A. G. Barr &amp; Co. as a private limited company with a share capital of &pound;25,000. From 1904 to 1959 the Glasgow and Falkirk businesses grew steadily, though as separate operations; but in 1959 A. G. Barr &amp; Co. purchased the Falkirk company to create a single company focused on Glasgow.<br>
