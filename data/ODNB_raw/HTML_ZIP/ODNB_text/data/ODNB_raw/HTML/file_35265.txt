<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Noyce,  (Cuthbert) Wilfrid Francis</span>  (1917&#150;1962), <span class="occ">mountaineer and writer</span>, was born at Simla, India, on 31 December 1917, the elder son in a family of two sons and a daughter of Sir Frank Noyce (1878&#150;1948) of the Indian Civil Service and his wife, Enid Isabel, daughter of W. M. Kirkus, of Liverpool. He was educated at Charterhouse, where he became head of the school, and in 1936 he went to King's College, Cambridge, as a major scholar. He obtained first-class honours in the classical tripos (part 1, 1939) and in the preliminary examination for part 2 of the modern languages tripos (1940), before graduating BA in 1940 and MA in 1945. In 1939 he joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit, but in 1940 joined the Welsh Guards as a private. Commissioned in the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1941, he spent the years 1942&#150;6 in India, first as a captain in intelligence and then as chief instructor at the aircrew mountain centre in Kashmir.<br>
<br>From 1946 until 1950 Noyce was an assistant master teaching modern languages at Malvern College. On 12 August 1950 he married Rosemary Campbell (<i>b</i>. 1925/6), daughter of Henry Campbell Davies, and there were two sons. Subsequently he taught for ten years at Charterhouse. In the latter period he served for some years on the Godalming borough council. He retired from teaching in 1961 in order to give more time to writing.<br>
<br>Already, at eighteen, Noyce was a fine rock climber, partly through the influence of a brilliant older companion, J. Menlove Edwards, with whom he climbed regularly between 1935 and 1937. He survived a serious accident on Scafell in 1937, when he fell 180 feet and was magnificently held by Edwards on a rope of which two of the three strands had parted. He was badly injured, especially about the face, and the completeness of his recovery was astonishing. In two early alpine seasons, 1937 (shortly before this accident) and 1938, climbing with either Armand Charlet or Hans Brantschen, both great guides, he made a series of major climbs in very fast times. During the war, when he was stationed in India, his exceptional stamina and capacity to acclimatize were demonstrated when he and Sherpa Angtharkay reached the top of Pauhunri in Sikkim (23,385 ft) fifteen days after leaving Darjeeling.<br>
<br>In 1946, climbing in a gale in the Lake District, Noyce was blown from his holds and broke a leg, and for some years he climbed to more ordinary standards. He was nevertheless an obvious choice for the 1953 Everest expedition, and at a critical stage it was Noyce and Sherpa Annullu who opened the route to the south col. Ten days later Noyce reached the col again, without oxygen, in support of the successful summit climb. Subsequently he had several impressive seasons in the Alps and one (1961) in the High Atlas, but his major ventures were further afield. In 1957 he was turned back by bad weather just below the top of Machapuchare (22,997 ft), a difficult peak in western Nepal, and in 1960 he led an expedition to Trivor (25,370 ft) in the Karakoram, where Noyce himself was one of the pair that reached the summit. His main reason for joining the Pamirs expedition on which he died was his wish to promote friendship between British and Russian mountaineers.<br>
<br>Noyce was a cultivated, unassuming man with an almost diffident manner. Despite his outstanding achievements, his appreciation of mountains was largely aesthetic and his instincts scholarly and literary. In 1947 he wrote an unusual autobiography, <span class="italic">Mountains and Men</span>, the first of more than a dozen books. These included two volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Michael Angelo: a Poem</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1960); some of the poems were written at 21,000 feet, on Everest. His main reputation was as a mountaineering author. He had a gift for conveying, vividly but with restraint and complete honesty, what mountain experiences were really like. This was skilfully demonstrated in <span class="italic">South Col</span> (1954), his personal story of Everest and easily his most successful book; but the same approach characterized his two later expedition books, <span class="italic">Climbing the Fish's Tail</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">To the Unknown Mountain</span> (1962). An earlier work, <span class="italic">Scholar Mountaineers</span> (1950), was a study of various historic figures who in different ways were both lovers of mountains and men of thought. He wrote one mountain novel, <span class="italic">The Gods are Angry</span> (1957). Latterly, he was moving away from purely mountain subjects; in <span class="italic">The Springs of Adventure</span> (1958) he explored the motives for engaging in any sort of hazardous activity, and in <span class="italic">They Survived</span> (1962) he made a case study of mankind's will to survive in desperate situations.<br>
<br>Noyce died in the USSR on 24 July 1962, when he and a companion fell, descending from the summit of Garmo Peak (<i>c</i>.21,500 ft) in the Pamirs. His wife survived him. His death cut short a literary career of notable achievement in a particular field, but one whose wider promise was not yet fulfilled.<br>
