<span class="headword">Haigh,  Mervyn George</span>  (1887&#150;1962), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 14 September 1887, the only son and the second of the three children of William Edward Haigh (<i>b</i>. 1850), vicar of Holy Trinity, Islington, and his wife, Janet Middleton (<i>b</i>. 1861). He was educated at home before attending a day school at Highbury and then, from 1899, Clifton College. At New College, Oxford (1906&#150;10), he gained second-class honours in moderations and Greats, after which he underwent theological training at the bishop's palace in Hereford, under the supervision of Dr Hastings Rashdall. He was ordained deacon at St Paul's Cathedral in 1911 and priested in 1912, then served curacies in East Finchley and Cranley Gardens, Chelsea, before volunteering as an army chaplain (1916). Haigh served in the former German colonial territories in east Africa until the end of the war, particularly in Dodoma, where, in addition to his normal chaplaincy duties, he distinguished himself as an effective counsel for the defence in three courts martial. He ministered, under appalling conditions, to soldiers suffering from a deadly &#145;Asian flu&#146;, before succumbing to malaria and returning to Britain (1919).<br>
<br>Building on his experience as an army chaplain, Haigh taught Reformation and Renaissance history in the Ordination Test School at Knutsford, a training centre for ex-soldiers interested in the ministry, based in a disused prison. Knutsford, the brainchild of P. T. B. (Tubby) Clayton, was a precursor of modern pre-ordination training, and Haigh responded enthusiastically to its ethos: more egalitarian and less academic than traditional theological colleges, and yet still open to theological innovation under the leadership of its principal, F. R. Barry. He also became examining chaplain to the bishop of Llandaff, J. P. Hughes&#151;the beginning of a long and fruitful association with Wales. He was involved in the early 1920s in the committee, led by Percy Dearmer, which produced the innovative (and doctrinally relaxed) <span class="italic">Songs of Praise</span>, and he was a key contributor to the &#145;Grey Book&#146;, a set of proposals for the revision of the prayer book drawn up by some of the leading liberals in the Church of England. The latter gave him the opportunity to exhibit his considerable flair for liturgy, and the poetic power and ecological sensitivity of a litany preserved in his hand might well have received more thorough recognition:<blockquote>
<div>Spirit of God, Thou art also the Perfect Artist:<br>
</div>
<div>Thy handiwork is the supreme miracle of beauty:<br>
</div>
<div>Thou didst clothe the grass of the field: the gleam of the buttercups and bluebells is Thy artistry, and the wind that sways them into laughter is Thy breath.<br>
</div> (Barry, 77&#150;8)</blockquote>In 1923 Haigh went to University College, Oxford, for a short-lived chaplain fellowship, and in 1924 Archbishop Davidson invited him to succeed George Bell as his chaplain. He found himself writing several of the archbishop's judicious pronouncements and overseeing the proposed revisions to the prayer book. He was instrumental in launching the &#145;Way of renewal&#146;, a scheme designed to make prayer and study the focal point of ruri-decanal chapters. Under Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang he was deeply involved in preparations for the 1930 Lambeth conference, and the encyclical letter which ensued, with its assertion that &#145;there is much in the scientific and philosophical thinking of our time which provides a climate more favourable to faith in God than has existed for generations&#146;  (Barry, 107&#150;9), was written by Haigh. During this time Haigh established himself as a spokesman for a broad Anglican liberalism, which had little in common with the extreme modernism and rationalism of Bishop E. W. Barnes of Birmingham.<br>
<br>Late in 1930 Haigh was appointed to the see of Coventry, where he immediately distinguished himself as an imaginative preacher, unafraid to criticize the past role of the church, for example, in trying &#145;to keep the arts, like the sciences, tied to the apron strings of its own elaborate but inadequate interpretation of life&#146;  (Barry, 123). In 1936 he underwent a severe physical breakdown, which almost induced his resignation, but he recovered enough to persevere. He led the diocese through the blitz in 1940, responding to the overnight destruction of the cathedral and four parish churches with an almost proverbial fortitude (it was also he who recognized the potential of the &#145;cross of nails&#146; devised by A. P. Wales). On 11 December 1940 he spoke publicly on the blitz, arousing considerable controversy with his conviction that:<blockquote>If the British Government were to decide that this form of attack will be used against German cities if it continues to be used against ours, it might well be morally justified in coming to that conclusion &hellip; we could not desire to inflict on any German city such a general bombardment of women and children and beautiful old buildings as there was in Coventry &hellip; But there are still many people among us who seem to think that the methods of warfare to which they have grown accustomed are morally defensible, while refusing as morally impossible for us, in any circumstances or on any conditions, to adopt novel and more terrible forms of warfare when and so long as these are performed against ourselves. These people do not seem to have quite realized what total warfare may require, and if we are not prepared for that we might have done better not to have begun resisting the Nazi aggression by force. (Barry, 137&#150;8)</blockquote>Writing privately to Bishop Hensley Henson, Haigh explained that &#145;Experience &amp; knowledge alike suggest that the Gov't may be minimizing the element of discrimination (as distinct from indiscriminate bombing) &hellip; and that it might be well for us &hellip; to concentrate more planes on larger targets&#146;  (Henson papers, 6 Jan 1941). Despite the widespread criticism of his remarks, they merely defended an attitude that was already covert government policy. The explosion of the two atomic bombs in 1945, which drove many who had criticized area bombing to a position of virtual pacifism, made Haigh's comments about &#145;total warfare&#146; seem the more prophetic.<br>
<br>In 1942 Haigh was translated to Winchester. At his enthronement he criticized the &#145;savage and inhuman theologies&#146; of the Barthians  (Barry, 123) and vigorously defended the church's right to campaign for social reform. As prelate of the Order of the Garter he was in constant contact with George VI. He was among those considered for the primacy after the death of Archbishop William Temple, but his own poor health, plagued by life-threatening low blood pressure, was already becoming a severe handicap. He resigned in 1952 at the age of sixty-five, but threw himself energetically into exploring the north Welsh countryside, taking rooms in the Golden Lion Hotel in Dolgellau. As county president of the Council for the Preservation of Rural Wales he campaigned to preserve the countryside, despite his increasing incapacity. He lived to see the rebuilding of Coventry Cathedral, and died on 20 May 1962 at Argoed, Dolgellau, shortly before its consecration. He was buried at Winchester Cathedral on 26 May. Bishop Haigh remained unmarried.<br>
