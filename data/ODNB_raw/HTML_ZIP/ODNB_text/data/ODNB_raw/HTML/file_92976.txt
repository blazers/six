<span class="headword">Gildesburgh, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1331&#150;1389), <span class="occ">soldier and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was related to John Gildesburgh (<i>d</i>. 1349), a London fishmonger of illegitimate birth, and to Peter Gildesburgh, a prominent official in the employment of Edward, the Black Prince, but his parentage is unknown. After schooling at Oxford, his military service began in the campaign culminating at Cr&eacute;cy in 1346, and continued in the retinue of Bartholomew, third Lord Burghersh (<i>d</i>. 1369), whom he accompanied back to France in 1355 in the Black Prince's company. A year later he fought at Poitiers. In 1358 he travelled to Brabant, again with Burghersh, and subsequently took part in Edward III's campaign that ended with the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny in 1360. Burghersh thought highly of him: he granted him for life a manor in Essex, petitioned Pope Urban V to give him the privilege of plenary remission of sins, and named him as his executor.<br>
<br>During a respite from service overseas Gildesburgh contracted an opportune marriage to the twice widowed Margery (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1365), daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Garnet (<i>d</i>. 1345), thereby acquiring Wennington in Essex and a number of other properties, which he retained for life. Now a tenant of Humphrey (IX) de Bohun, seventh earl of Hereford, he entered the earl's service, and having taken part in Bohun's naval expedition of 1371 he was rewarded with a manor in Hertfordshire. In December 1372 the earl appointed him as an executor of his will. He stood surety for the guardian of the Bohun estates during the minority of the earl's two daughters, Eleanor and Mary, and following Eleanor's marriage to Edward III's youngest son, Thomas of Woodstock, earl of Buckingham, he joined the latter's affinity. He was knighted in August 1378, while serving in Woodstock's retinue on a largely futile expedition to Brittany.<br>
<br>When first returned to parliament by Essex in January 1380 Gildesburgh was aged nearly fifty, and a seasoned veteran of the French wars. His being elected speaker, despite his lack of familiarity with the workings of the Commons, may be attributed to his position as Woodstock's retainer and to the urgent need to send a relief force to Brittany; a major expedition to the duchy had foundered at sea in December, and it was now proposed to send Woodstock with a new army, which would have to be financed by parliament. In Gildesburgh's &#145;protestation&#146; he asked that anything he said that displeased the king should not be attributed to the Commons, but be put down to his own ignorance. After complaining about heavy taxation and asking for the dissolution of the king's &#145;continual council&#146; (on the grounds that the thirteen-year-old Richard II was sufficiently mature to select his own advisers) the Commons demanded that a commission should be appointed to investigate the state of the royal household. Gildesburgh was appointed to this body on 2 March, the day before parliament ended. The Commons requested that the proceeds of the subsidies granted should be used exclusively to finance Woodstock's force, and in June Gildesburgh was named among the receivers of the money allocated.<br>
<br>When another parliament assembled at Northampton on 5 November Gildesburgh was re-elected speaker. As such he asked for a statement of the amount needed for Woodstock's army to winter in Brittany. The sum demanded, &pound;160,000, was deemed &#145;moelt outrageouse et oultrement importable&#146;, but eventually the Commons granted a poll tax of 3 groats  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 3.89). This infamous triple poll tax triggered off the peasants' revolt, and in view of Gildesburgh's part in its grant, his appointment to a commission to detect tax evasion, and the location of his property in the county where the insurrection began, he did well to escape with his life. He was sent to restore order at Brentwood on 30 May 1381, but three of the clerks accompanying the commissioners were murdered and he himself fled, leaving his manors to be plundered by the rebels. After obtaining from Richard II a licence to recover his stolen goods, &#145;howsoever he pleased&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1381&#150;5</i>, 24), he probably assisted Woodstock in suppressing the revolt.<br>
<br>Gildesburgh sat in the Commons again in 1383 and 1385, having in the meantime accompanied Woodstock on John of Gaunt's expedition into Scotland in 1384. Election to his fifth parliament, the Merciless Parliament of 1388, probably owed much to his connection with Woodstock, now duke of Gloucester, who as one of the lords appellant then had control of the government. During the parliamentary recess he was appointed to take oaths in support of the appellants from local notables. His health was now failing, and he made settlements of his estates, naming among his feoffees two other former speakers, Sir Thomas Hungerford and Sir Richard Waldegrave. He died without surviving children at an unknown date between February and October 1389, and was buried with his first wife and their daughters in Wennington church. His second wife, Elizabeth, only child of William Pembridge of Gedding, Suffolk, inherited her father's estates in 1392, and married Sir John Deyncourt (<i>d</i>. 1393), steward of the household of John of Gaunt. At her death about 1399 she was buried with Deyncourt in the church of the Greyfriars in London.<br>
