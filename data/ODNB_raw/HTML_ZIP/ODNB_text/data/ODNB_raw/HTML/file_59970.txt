<span class="headword">Osgood,  James Ripley</span>  (1836&#150;1892), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 22 April 1836 in Fryeburg, Oxford, Maine, USA, the son of Colonel Edward Lewis Osgood and his wife, Abigail Ripley Dana, the daughter of a distinguished Boston family. He was the brother of Kate Putnam Osgood (<i>b</i>. 1841), who later became a poet and wrote the famous civil war poem &#145;Driving home the cows&#146;. He was educated at Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, from 1850 to 1854, and in August 1855 became a clerk in the publishing firm of Ticknor &amp; Fields. He was made a junior partner in 1864, and it was in this capacity that he travelled to London in 1867. He was commissioned with the task of soliciting contributions from Charles Dickens for the company's periodicals, but a more significant outcome was reported in the <span class="italic">American Literary Gazette</span> on 1 June 1867: &#145;One of the results of his successful tour is [that] &hellip; Charles Dickens &hellip; [has] decided to recognize Ticknor &amp; Fields as the only authorized publisher of his works in America&#146;  (Moss and Moss, 84n.).<br>
<br>It was at this time that Dickens was considering a second reading tour of North America and was in contact with J. T. Fields, among others, about arrangements. Osgood became involved in these, travelling with George Dolby, the tour's general manager, on the initial inspection of venues. His extensive social connections were useful in this regard; Dolby called him &#145;one of the most popular men in America&#146;  (Dolby, 107). On the tour proper Osgood was engaged in administrative duties, including acting as treasurer&#151;Dickens commented that the financial records were &#145;excellently kept by Mr. Osgood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 12.12) and engaging in the constant battle against speculators, attempting (with limited success) to prevent ticket touts from obtaining and re-selling tickets. He was also a member of Dickens's unofficial &#145;body-guard&#146;, conducting the novelist to and from his readings and protecting him during the performances, in one instance literally throwing a dog out of the room &#145;in a transport of presence of mind and fury&#146;  (ibid., 12.3, 41). Dickens described him in another letter with a combination of admiration and good-humoured fun: &#145;Osgood is on guard. He made a most brilliant appearance before the Philadelphia public, and looked hard at them. The mastery of his eye diverted their attention from his boots:&#151;charming in themselves, but (unfortunately) two left ones&#146;  (ibid., 12.18).<br>
<br>Osgood and Dolby also paid particular attention to Dickens's morale, as he himself admitted to being &#145;often heavy, and rarely sleep[ing] much&#146;. Osgood's place in Dickensian legend was secured by his role in a &#145;ridiculous&#146;, twelve-mile walking competition designed to keep Dickens in spirits; as the Boston Bantam, Osgood represented America, competing against Dolby, as the Man of Ross  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 12.29&#150;30, 714). Dickens drew up the articles of agreement for the contest, held on 29 February 1868, and Osgood emerged victorious by half a mile. Dickens later often referred to him as the &#145;Bantam&#146;, and he was f&ecirc;ted at a sumptuous dinner given by Dickens for eighteen friends in honour of the event. Upon his return from America, however, Dickens became caught up with business and a British reading tour, and neglected to correspond with Osgood for over a year. This led to a remonstrative letter from Osgood; Dickens admitted the fault, assuring Osgood in December 1868 that &#145;The remembrance of your ever ready interest and zeal, and of your cheery companionship in scorching railway cars and eccentric hotels, is never to be so lightly dealt with on my side&#146;  (ibid., 12.238).<br>
<br>Due largely to his success in dealing with Dickens's second reading tour Osgood became a senior partner of Fields, Osgood &amp; Co. in 1868. Having accumulated sufficient publishing experience he set up on his own in 1871 as James R. Osgood &amp; Co., a company that published Henry James's first volume of fiction, <span class="italic">A Passionate Pilgrim and other Tales</span> (1875), as well as some other early works by James, including <span class="italic">Roderick Hudson</span> (1875) and <span class="italic">The American</span> (1877). As director of this firm Osgood also arranged with Thomas Hardy for the American publication of some works first published in the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>. In May 1885, however, Henry James noted that &#145;J. R. Osgood &amp; Co., my dear Boston publishers, have failed&#146;  (James, 79). Although a &#145;man of integrity &hellip; he had apparently managed his business poorly&#146;  (Edel, 82), as his &#145;enthusiasm for literary publishing [had] unfortunately often remained unchecked by economic realities&#146;  (Winship, 23). After this bankruptcy Osgood left America and settled in London in 1886. There he acted as an agent for Harper &amp; Brothers, where, while he had few further dealings with James, he continued to correspond with Hardy, this time about the printing of his work in <span class="italic">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</span>. In November 1890, with the assistance of Harpers, Osgood set up business again&#151;as partner, with Clarence W. McIlvaine, in Osgood, McIlvaine &amp; Co., at 45 Albemarle Street. In the following year they published Hardy's <span class="italic">A Group of Noble Dames</span> and the first edition in volume format of <span class="italic">Tess of the D'Urbervilles</span> (initially published in instalments in <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>)&#151;commissions given to the new firm by Hardy probably &#145;[i]n part as a gesture of friendship towards &hellip; Osgood&#146;  (Millgate, 308).<br>
<br>Osgood died at his home, 161A Piccadilly, London, on 18 May 1892; Hardy travelled up to the city for his funeral, on 22 May. The firm continued for a few years, publishing in 1895&#150;6 the handsome and textually important &#145;first uniform and complete edition&#146; of Hardy's Wessex novels, which included the first edition in book format of <span class="italic">Jude the Obscure</span> (1896 [1 November 1895]). Osgood, McIlvaine &amp; Co., however, was soon afterwards absorbed by Harper &amp; Brothers, with McIlvaine continuing to act as their representative in London.<br>
