<span class="headword">Lane,  Richard James</span>  (1800&#150;1872), <span class="occ">lithographer and sculptor</span>, was born on 16 February 1800 at Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire, the second son of the Revd Theophilus Lane (1764&#150;1814), prebendary of Hereford Cathedral, and his wife, Sophia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gardiner, the niece of the painter Thomas Gainsborough. He was the elder brother of the Arabic scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15990/', "Edward William Lane")</script>. He married, on 10 November 1825, Sophia Hodges, with whom he had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>From childhood Lane showed an interest in practical and artistic things, and at the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to the line engraver Charles Heath. After completing his apprenticeship he worked as an engraver for some years, and in 1827 produced a fine print after Sir Thomas Lawrence's <span class="italic">Red Riding Hood</span>. By this time he had become dissatisfied with the commercialization of engraving and had abandoned it for lithography, a process Heath had been one of the first to practise in Britain. Lane's earliest lithographs date from 1824, and in this year his skills were recognized by the leading lithographic printer Charles Hullmandel, who employed him to produce a title vignette for his <span class="italic">Art of Drawing on Stone</span> (1824) and referred to him briefly in his text as though he was already one of the most accomplished lithographers in Britain. Lane maintained a close association with Hullmandel, who printed nearly all his early lithographs and also called on him for his <span class="italic">On Some Important Improvements in Lithographic Printing</span> (1827) to illustrate a method of making changes to a drawing on stone once printing had begun. Lane soon established a reputation for the quality of his craftsmanship in lithography and thereby helped to raise the status of this fledgeling process by achieving something of the &#145;finish&#146; of engraving that was so sought after at the time. He was particularly praised for his delicate crayon work, which, especially in small-scale prints, was unsurpassed in Britain. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1824 and continued exhibiting there regularly until his death, and also occasionally at the Suffolk Street Gallery. He was elected an ARA in 1827. Not long before this he had dedicated his <span class="italic">Studies of Figures by Gainsborough</span> (1825) to the president of the Royal Academy, Sir Thomas Lawrence. Lane produced most of the plates of this work in tinted lithography in imitation of Gainsborough's crayon originals, many of which were drawn on tinted paper and touched up with white. The outcome was one of the most remarkable applications of tinted lithography in the 1820s.<br>
<br>Lane worked mainly as a reproductive lithographer and produced several sets of lithographs which were much praised at the time, including <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Late John Philip Kemble</span> (1826) and <span class="italic">Lithographic Imitations of Sketches by Modern Artists</span> (1827). However, his specialism was portraiture, and he produced hundreds of lithographs of this kind, including portraits of Queen Victoria and members of the royal family, leading artists and actors, and other notable figures, among them Lord Byron. The quality of his portrait lithography was reflected in the fees he charged, which in 1849 were sometimes as high as &pound;100. He also took on other kinds of reproductive work, notably some of the tinted lithographs for J. F. Lewis's <span class="italic">Lewis's Sketches and Drawings of the Alhambra</span> (1835). His total number of prints is recorded as 1046. Victoria sat for him in 1829 when she was a ten-year-old princess, and he made other portraits of her when she was queen, some of which he lithographed. In 1837 he was appointed lithographer to the queen, and three years later to the prince consort. He also made statuettes, and in 1835 he executed a life-size seated statue of his brother Edward in Egyptian dress. His bust of this brother (<i>c</i>.1833) is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Lane had acted as assistant to the sculptor J. E. Carew and gave evidence for his master in a lawsuit of 1840.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Lane taught at the government School of Design (later the Royal College of Art). In 1864 he took over the etching class, which had been established by J. M. Del&acirc;tre not long before; he also taught lithography there. In 1865 he was largely instrumental in securing the right of engravers to be admitted as full academicians. Perversely, he has attracted most attention since his death in connection with a set of four portraits of the North family, drawn by Ingres in Rome in 1815 and printed by Hullmandel in London in the early 1820s, which&#151;it has been suggested&#151;he may have put on stone. He was noted for his fine tenor voice and remarkable memory, which included the ability to recite. In addition to his circle of artist friends, he was at home with leading figures from the opera and theatre; among his closest friends were Charles Kemble (whose <span class="italic">Readings from Shakespeare</span> he edited in 1870), W. C. Macready, C. A. Fechter, and Maria Felici&aacute; Malibran. He wrote three works, including <span class="italic">Life at the Water Cure, or, A Month at Malvern</span> (1846). He died at his home, 19 Gloucester Terrace, Campden Hill, Kensington, on 21 November 1872. He was survived by his wife.<br>
