<span class="headword">Warner,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1565), <span class="occ">dean of Winchester and physician</span>, was born in Great Stanmore, Middlesex. He graduated BA at Oxford University in 1520, and was elected a fellow of All Souls College in the same year. He proceeded MA in 1525, and was admitted BM in 1529. At about the same time he was licensed to practise by the university. He acted as proctor in 1529 and 1530, proceeded DM in 1535, and was elected warden of All Souls on 26 May 1536, a position which he retained until 1560 (with an intermission under Mary). In 1540 Henry VIII appointed him first regius professor of medicine at Oxford University. He resigned the chair in 1554, when he became vice-chancellor, a post he also held in 1559&#150;60.<br>
<br>Warner had taken holy orders in 1537 and became rector of Northmoor, Oxfordshire (1538), of Great Houghton, Northamptonshire (1539), Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire (1544), and Elmley Chapel, Kent (1545). On 30 April 1547 he was appointed to the prebend of Ealdstreet in the diocese of London, and in July of the same year he was nominated archdeacon of Cleveland, an appointment which he resigned about a year before his death. In 1550 he was installed a prebendary of Winchester. He was also archdeacon of Ely and of Cleveland, canon of St Paul's and of Lincoln, and royal chaplain, resigning before 1560. On account of his pro-Reformation sympathies, he was in disgrace during the reign of Mary, but received in 1557 the rectory of Hayes, together with the chapel of Norwood, in Middlesex. He was restored to All Souls in 1559, after the death of Mary, and then received a prebend at Salisbury; and on 15 October of the same year he was nominated dean of Winchester. He was also archdeacon of Ely in 1560, but resigned in the same year. On 17 October 1561 he was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians.<br>
<br>Warner was clearly an ambitious man. Wood said that &#145;He was a learned man of his time, but published nothing, and was a great intruder into ecclesiastical benefices and dignities&#146;. Warner died at his house in Warwick Lane, London, on 21 March 1565, and was buried in the chancel of the church of Great Stanmore, Middlesex. He bequeathed a small number of books to the library of All Souls.<br>
