<span class="headword">Marten <span class="st"> [Martin]</span>,  Anthony</span>  (<em>c.</em>1542&#150;1597), <span class="occ">courtier and author</span>, was the son of David Marten (<i>d</i>. 1556) of Westminster and Twickenham, Middlesex, and his wife, Jane Cooke (<i>d</i>. 1563), of Greenwich, Kent. Apparently he had five sisters. David Marten had been senior clerk to the surveyor of the king's works since 1531, and in 1535 he became comptroller. Anthony Marten was at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in August 1564 when Elizabeth I visited; he does not seem to have graduated, but entered the royal household. By 27 April 1570 he had become the queen's &#145;sewar&#146;; on that night, having been &#145;at Whitehall &hellip; serving at &hellip; the queen's dinner&#146;, he was waylaid by George Varneham of Richmond, Surrey, &#145;with malice aforethought &hellip; and having a sword and buckler&#146;. Forced to fight somewhat outside the palace, &#145;near the bridge towards Scotland Gate&#146;, Marten, though presumably without a buckler, wounded Varneham mortally  (Jeaffreson, 1.65). Marten&#151;and also his servant, which might imply that the fight was less clear-cut than alleged&#151;had to give recognizances to appear at the next gaol delivery, but seems to have avoided further repercussions.<br>
<br>In July 1579 Marten, styled the queen's steward, was granted the bailiffship of Ledbury, Herefordshire, but he surrendered it in March 1586. On 1 August 1587 he was present at Peterborough as sewer for the funeral of Mary Stewart. In August 1588 Elizabeth granted him a lease of a house at Richmond, and made him keeper of the royal library in the palace of Westminster for life at 20 marks per annum. In November 1591, as royal cup-bearer (<i>dapifer</i>), he was granted a monopoly for licensing exports of tin, being paid 4<i>d</i>. per hundredweight. This apparently survived a competitive tender in 1595 by Edward de Vere, earl of Oxford, who claimed that through the licence to &#145;one Martin&#146;, &#145;being not diligently looked into, her majesty loseth very near half the custom due for want of entering the just weight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 5.137).<br>
<br>Both professional and religious considerations made it fitting for Marten to dedicate to Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, the lord chamberlain, his translations of John Bernard's <span class="italic">Tranquillitie of the Minde</span> (1570) and <span class="italic">The Commonplaces of Peter Martyr</span> (1583), the first of which he rather mysteriously described as fulfilling &#145;my promise &hellip; in my former epistle made to your lordship&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tranquillitie</span>, sig. *2<i>r</i>). By the second he felt some need to justify &#145;to the Christian reader&#146; such an undertaking from one &#145;living in court, as it were in continuall peregrination, and as a Rechabit among the children of Israel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Commonplaces</span>, sig. Ai<i>r</i>). Marten recommended the work of Pietro Martire Vermigli (known as Peter Martyr) for &#145;a particular discoverie of the Romaine Antichristian kingdome&#146;; this provided the focus for his next publication, <span class="italic">An exhortation, to stirre up the mindes of all her majestie's faithfull subjects, to defend their countrey</span> (1588). His sense of England as an Israel beleaguered by a new Sennacherib was not uncommon that year, but more eccentric was <span class="italic">A second sound, or, Warning of the trumpet unto judgment, wherein is proved that all the tokens of the latter day are not onelie come, but welneere finished</span> (1589). His prediction that Antichrist's war against the professors of the gospel was now so far advanced as to indicate the end of the world within the next five years allowed him to fulfil a pretension already immanent in his earlier prefaces&#151;to preach theology and morality to bishops. He warned them against self-advancement &#145;by some corrupt and sinister meanes&#146; and admonished them to eject &#145;unlearned pastors&#146; and pursue England's moral reformation  (<span class="italic">Second Sound</span>, 27).<br>
<br>The apotheosis of Marten's bishop-lecturing was his intervention in the presbyterian controversy with <span class="italic">A Reconciliation of All the Pastors and Cleargy of the Church of England</span> (1590). It attracted the ire of Sir Francis Knollys, who accused not only John Whitgift but &#145;Mr Martyn the sewer, an ordynarye servant to hir majestie&#146; of treason or <i>praemunire</i> in denying her authority to be the origin of episcopal power  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/233/62). Knollys's position as treasurer of the household seems to have provoked an over-sensitive reaction to the sewer's essentially adiaphorist view of episcopacy and presbyterianism, the latter as practised in Scotland being &#145;the harder and more dangerous course&#146;. Marten's professed wish for reconciliation, involving the general abandonment of &#145;unprofitable wrightings&#146;, seems genuine, while his continued obsession with the threat of &#145;the bloudy beast of Rome&#146; and his &#145;present expectation of Christ unto judgement&#146; hardly made him a natural ally of Richard Bancroft or Adrian Saravia. In approving the latter's &#145;Latin labours&#146; published &#145;when I had wellneere finished all these matters&#146; and in attacking John Udall, Marten betrayed some confusion  (<span class="italic">Reconciliation</span>, sigs. 6<i>v</i>, a<i>r</i>, 3<i>v</i>, 1<i>v</i>, A4<i>r</i>). His &#145;position would appear to be little different from that of Knollys himself&#146;; &#145;at heart a theologian <i>manqu&eacute;</i>&#146;, his last work was affected by &#145;personal inability to think clearly&#146; but was notable as &#145;almost the only Elizabethan defence of episcopacy to be written by a layman&#146;  (Thompson, &#145;Marten&#146;, 70, 46, 75).<br>
<br>Apparently unmarried, Marten made his will on 21 August 1597. He died at Richmond, and was buried with his father at Twickenham church on 25 August. Besides the Richmond lease, he left &pound;19 to charities&#151;&pound;17 at Richmond (&pound;10 for the relatively conservative object of a church bell), implying continued residence there, and only a token &pound;2 at Twickenham&#151;and some &pound;162 to individuals, mostly to the families of four of his sisters.<br>
