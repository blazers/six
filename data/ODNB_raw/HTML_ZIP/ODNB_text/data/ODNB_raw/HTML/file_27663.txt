<span class="headword">Train,  Joseph</span>  (1779&#150;1852), <span class="occ">exciseman and antiquary</span>, was born on 6 November 1779 at Gilminscroft in the parish of Sorn, Ayrshire, where his father was land steward. In 1787 the family moved to Ayr, where Train's father became a day labourer. His own schooling was limited. At an early age he was apprenticed to a weaver in Ayr, but he persevered with private study, taking a particular interest in antiquarian and traditional lore.<br>
<br>Train joined the ranks of the 7th North British regiment of militia in June 1798. For almost four years he served as a private at barracks and camps in various parts of Scotland, until the regiment was run down during the peace of Amiens. He then returned to the loom in Ayr, and on 30 April 1803 married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1780), daughter of Robert Wilson, a gardener in that town. The couple had five children.<br>
<br>In 1806 Train published his <span class="italic">Poetical Reveries</span>, the first fruit of his scholarly and literary pursuits. One of the subscribers was his former company commander, Sir David Hunter Blair. Two years later Blair secured Train an appointment in the Scottish excise, and he entered as an assistant officer. A transfer in 1810 from Ayr to Balnaguard, in Perthshire, pitted him against the whisky bootleggers for a year, after which he was posted back to Ayrshire, as an officer. A period of more stability ensued after he was moved in 1813 from Largs to Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire. His work now ranged over much of Galloway and Carrick, and he began to gather materials for a history of the region. He also turned into verse some of the tales and traditions that he had collected. When these were printed by Ballantyne in 1814, under the title <span class="italic">Strains of the Mountain Muse</span>, they caught the eye of Walter Scott (an anecdote in the collection eventually provided the outline of Scott's &#145;Wandering Willie's Tale&#146;, in <span class="italic">Redgauntlet</span>). At this time Scott was working on <span class="italic">The Lord of the Isles</span> and he asked Train for information about Turnberry Castle, where Bruce landed on his return from Ireland. From then on Train willingly subordinated his pursuits to Scott's interests and was soon sending him pages crammed with antiquarian material. One of the stories that he forwarded was of an astrologer wandering in the wilds of Galloway who predicted the future of a new-born child, and this was woven into the opening chapters of <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>. In the course of their long friendship Train was just as assiduous in finding curiosities for Scott's museum, including Rob Roy's pouch, which was the germ of the novel featuring that outlaw.<br>
<br>Scott did what he could to further Train's career. He passed on to the chairman of the Scottish excise board a paper that Train had produced on the control of distillation of spirits, and the proposals were implemented. In 1816 Train made the first of several visits to Scott in Edinburgh. On this occasion he fired Scott's imagination with his accounts of Robert Paterson&#151;&#145;Old Mortality&#146;&#151;thus suggesting the theme of the novel of that name. Scott's melodrama <span class="italic">The Doom of Devorgoil</span>, completed in 1817, was based on another of Train's stories. <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span>, published in the following year, was indebted to Train for information about the prototype of Madge Wildfire, a figure known as Feckless Fannie who formerly wandered through Ayrshire and Galloway. Other beneficiaries of Train's researches at this time included George Chalmers, who sought his assistance for sections of his bulky historical and topographical work <span class="italic">Caledonia</span>.<br>
<br>Scott's efforts on Train's behalf bore further fruit in 1820. He was placed on the list for promotion to the grade of supervisor, leading to another succession of postings, to Cupar in Fife, to Kirkintilloch, to Queensferry, and to Falkirk. In September 1823 a single board was created to manage the excise in the United Kingdom as a whole, and Scott turned his attention southwards. In 1824 he recommended his prot&eacute;g&eacute; to Peel, the home secretary, who drew in Lord Liverpool, the prime minister, and a &#145;whisper&#146; was conveyed to the new board. But all did not go smoothly. Many Scottish officers were convinced that they were discriminated against by English officials who occupied some of the key posts in Edinburgh. Train, for one, was found guilty of negligence, on flimsy grounds, and was removed from Falkirk to Wigtown at the end of 1824; he did, however, succeed in an application for a more congenial vacancy in Dumfries a few months later. Robert Burns, who had briefly officiated there as supervisor, described the job as &#145;an incessant drudgery, and would be nearly a compleat bar to every species of literary pursuit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Letters of Robert Burns</span>, 1987, 715). Train made the best of it. He was able to recover stories of Burns and passed them on to Lockhart when he was working on his life of Burns, while presenting other documents to Scott. He also still found time for visits to Edinburgh and Abbotsford. On one of these he related the story that formed the basis of <span class="italic">The Surgeon's Daughter</span> in the first series of <span class="italic">Chronicles of the Canongate</span>. Scott's introduction (1827) to these chronicles complemented his recent public acknowledgement of authorship of the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels with a tribute to those who had supplied &#145;hints of subjects and legends&#146;. He gave pride of place to Train's &#145;unremitting kindness&#146; and &#145;unwearied industry&#146;.<br>
<br>If Train was as diligent in his official duties as he was in searching for antiquarian lore, he well deserved Scott's lobbying. Once more, however, he met with disapproval on account of a supposed negligence, and was reduced from the rank of supervisor. On appeal he regained his former grade, but at the same time was posted to Castle Douglas late in 1827. Before long Scott's preparations for his <i>magnum opus</i> edition of the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels stimulated a new cycle of activity, and Train began supplying a variety of fresh information, utilized in Scott's introductions and notes. Further recognition came in November 1829, when Train was admitted fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Scott's death in 1832 left a great blank, but Train's interest in his old studies endured. Having retired from the excise on health grounds in 1836, with an annual pension of &pound;112, he remained in Castle Douglas, free to return to authorship on his own account. Scott had long before urged him to undertake a history of the Isle of Man. Train now produced his substantial <span class="italic">Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man</span>, published in Douglas in four parts in 1842&#150;5. It was followed in 1846 by <span class="italic">The Buchanites from First to Last</span>, chronicling a peculiar religious sect that had had a following in south-west Scotland. He also kept up an extensive correspondence with a circle of scholarly friends, and among those who applied to him for help was Agnes Strickland, seeking materials for a life of Mary, queen of Scots.<br>
<br>James Hannay visited Train towards the end of 1852, afterwards describing him as &#145;a tall old man, with an autumnal red in his face, hale-looking, and of simple, quaint manners&#146;  (Hannay, 476). The little parlour in Lochvale Cottage, on the banks of Carlingwark Loch, Castle Douglas, was full of antiquities and specimens of ancient furniture, which Train proudly displayed to his visitor. A few weeks later, on 7 December 1852, after a short illness, he died peacefully at his cottage, in his seventy-fourth year.<br>
