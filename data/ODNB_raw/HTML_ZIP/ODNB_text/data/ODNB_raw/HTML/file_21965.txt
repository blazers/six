<span class="headword">Perigal,  Arthur, the elder</span>  (1784&#150;1847), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in London on 10 January 1784, one of the six sons and seven daughters of Fran&ccedil;ois Perigal (1731&#150;1821) and his wife, Marie Ogier (1744&#150;1824). On 21 January 1808 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he studied under Henry Fuseli. After winning a silver medal in 1809, and the gold medal for history painting in 1811 with <span class="italic">Themistocles Taking Refuge at the Court of King Admetus</span> (exh. RA, 1812), he embarked on a career as a painter of ambitious subjects from Shakespeare, Scott, Plutarch, English history, and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He showed nine of these at the Royal Academy and twelve at the British Institution but few found buyers and he turned increasingly to portraiture and landscape painting. On 1 September 1812 he married, in London, Louisa Susanna Pilleau (1780&#150;1861), with whom he had four sons including <a href="#cosubject_21966">Arthur Perigal the younger [<i>see below</i>]</a> and one daughter. In 1821 he had an address in Sheep Street, Northampton, but in 1823 he lived at 48 George Street, Manchester. There he practised as a portrait painter and art teacher and was active in setting up the Royal Manchester Institution (since 1882, Manchester City Galleries). By 13 December 1828 Perigal had begun work on a large canvas, <span class="italic">The Manchester Fancy Dress Ball</span> (City of Salford Museum and Art Gallery), portraying the culminating event of the Manchester music festival of that year. Despite measuring 7 feet by 10 feet this painting is really a <i>tour de force</i> of the miniaturist's art. At a significant point in the growth of &#145;Cottonopolis&#146;, Robert Peel, home secretary, and 400 members of Manchester's merchant &eacute;lite are portrayed at leisure, all dressed in exotic costumes of the most striking variety. A probable self-portrait is included on the right-hand side. Perigal attended in the costume of &#145;an old gentleman of George II. d's time&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 4 Oct 1828). Completed in eighteen months, the picture was praised in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>  (10 July 1830) as &#145;a faithful representation of the most brilliant scene ever witnessed in Manchester&#146;. Yet it was not a significant popular success, and could not compete with the drama of John Martin's <span class="italic">Fall of Nineveh</span> shown in the city some months earlier. It was subsequently raffled and presented to Salford Art Gallery in 1852. Twenty-one related watercolour studies are in Manchester Public Library. Several of the likenesses, executed in tiny hatched strokes, are superior to those in the finished oil painting, but the handling of the drapery is cursory.<br>
<br>Perigal moved to Edinburgh in 1832 where, assisted by his sons, he set up a &#145;Drawing Institution&#146;, first at 19 Hill Street, then at 21 Hill Street. From 1833 until 1846 he exhibited landscapes, portraits, and miniatures at the Royal Scottish Academy. He also showed some of his early history paintings, which remained unsold after nearly thirty years. On 19 September 1847 he died at his home, 21 Hill Street.<br>
<br>Perigal's son <a name="cosubject_21966"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Perigal the younger</span>  (1816&#150;1884), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born in London on 17 August 1816 and baptized at St Mary, St Marylebone Road, on 9 October 1816. He first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1837 and thereafter showed more than 300 landscapes. On 1 September 1847 he married Hannah Stevenson (<i>b</i>. 1827), with whom he had nine children. After 1861 he also exhibited at the Royal Academy and the British Institution in London. Working initially with his father, he mainly portrayed scenes in the Scottish highlands and the borders but occasionally also worked in the Lake District and north Wales. After an extended tour of Norway in 1870 and a later visit to Italy he also exhibited views of these countries together with some Swiss scenes. He worked in both oils and watercolours and was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1841 and a full member in 1868. From 1880 to 1884 he served as the academy's treasurer. He died suddenly at his home, 7 Oxford Terrace, Edinburgh, on 5 June 1884 and was buried in the Dean cemetery; his wife survived him. There are examples of his paintings in Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum, Dundee City Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Scotland, and other public collections.<br>
