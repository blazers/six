<span class="headword">Gray,  Basil</span>  (1904&#150;1989), <span class="occ">museum curator</span>, was born on 21 July 1904 at 13 Elvaston Place, South Kensington, London, the younger son (there were no daughters) of Surgeon-Major Charles Gray of the Royal Army Medical Corps, a passionate traveller, and his wife, Florence Elworthy, daughter of the Revd Henry von der Heyde Cowell. He was educated at Bradfield College and at New College, Oxford, where he gained a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1926) and a second in modern history (1927). On going down from Oxford, in 1928 he worked for a season on the excavations at the great palace of the Byzantine emperors in Constantinople, where, however, his interests firmly turned to eastern rather than classical art, and then, for three months, in Vienna under Josef Strzygowski.<br>
<br>Gray entered the British Museum late in 1928. There being no vacancy in the antiquities departments, he spent an interim year in the department of printed books. In 1930 he transferred to the subdepartment of oriental prints and drawings, then still a division of the department of prints and drawings, under R. Laurence Binyon, the poet and distinguished orientalist whom he joined, with J. V. S. Wilkinson, to write the standard work <span class="italic">Persian Miniature Painting</span> (1933). In 1933 he married Nicolete Mary (1911&#150;1997) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66078/', "Gray, Nicolete")</script>], daughter of Laurence Binyon, herself a distinguished medievalist, designer of inscriptions, and historian of lettering. They had two sons and three daughters. Their eldest daughter, Camilla (<i>d</i>. 1971), the historian of the Russian avant-garde, married the son of the composer Sergey Prokofiev.<br>
<br>When the department of oriental antiquities was created in 1933, Gray was given the task of redisplaying the collection of Indian sculpture. The Chinese exhibition of 1935 then directed his attention to the Far East. By the outbreak of the Second World War his writings covered the whole field of eastern art, Islam, India, China, and Japan. His later work, however, dealt with the close relations between the arts of China and Persia, following the Mongol invasion and under the successors of Tamerlane&#151;for example, in his important contributions, as editor and joint author, to <span class="italic">The Arts of the Book in Central Asia, 1307&#150;1506</span> (1979), which definitively establish the prime role of princely patronage in the painting of eastern Islamic cultures.<br>
<br>Gray was placed in charge of the oriental collections in 1938, though, on account of his youth, he was appointed deputy keeper only in 1940 and keeper of oriental antiquities in 1946. Under his long keepership (until 1969) the immensely important collection of orientalia in the British Museum was complemented by a department of carefully chosen distinguished younger specialists. Gray was the friend and trusted adviser of many great collectors, stimulating their interest and moulding their taste. His confidence in their public-spiritedness was more than justified by their generosity to the British Museum.<br>
<br>Gray's outstanding career at the British Museum was recognized when he was made CBE in 1957 and CB in 1969, and by his appointment as acting director and principal librarian in 1968. In 1966 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy, and was closely associated with the British institutes of Persian and of Afghan (later South Asian) studies. His chairmanship of exhibitions of Islamic art in Cairo (1969) and Beirut (1974) culminated in the exhibition &#145;The arts of Islam&#146;, at the Hayward Gallery, London (1976), the most important of its kind since the Munich exhibition of 1910. His particular contribution to the study of Persian art was marked by his election as president of the Societas Iranologica Europaea, a post he held from 1983 to 1987.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1969 Gray continued to travel, lecture, write, and advise official committees, one of his few recreations being the Savile Club, of which he was a member for sixty years. He was a committed member of the Church of England and was churchwarden both in London at St George's, Bloomsbury, and in Oxfordshire at Long Wittenham, where he lived for the last twenty years of his life. He was elegantly neat in physique, with austere features offset by humorous eyes and bushy eyebrows. His suits and shirts were always tailor-made even when he was not well off. His colleagues remember him as forthright and rather autocratic in his earlier years. To his younger colleagues, however, he was a remarkable teacher, by precept and example, and his works reveal his patience and his eagle eye for decorative detail. Gray died in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 10 June 1989 and was buried in Long Wittenham parish churchyard.<br>
