<span class="headword">Shepheard,  George</span>  (1770&#150;1842), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and engraver</span>, was born on 26 January 1770 in Guildford, Surrey. He was the second of the four sons and a daughter of George Shepheard (1747&#150;1820) and Jane, daughter of John Baxter. The Shepheards were descended from a branch of the old Herefordshire family of Wallwyn or Walwyn, which had been seated at Hellens, Much Marcle, near Ledbury, since the reign of Henry V. On the evidence of a caricature drawing dated 1793, formerly in the Williams collection  (Williams, 147), it would appear that George Shepheard's parents had connections with East Sheen in Surrey. On similar evidence it would seem that he was a pupil of &#145;Dickenson&#146;, perhaps the mezzotint engraver William Dickinson, along with a lifelong friend, the painter and engraver Matthew Haughton, son of the enamel and still-life painter Moses Haughton. He also studied at the Royal Academy Schools from 31 December 1786, winning a silver medal in 1790.<br>
<br>It is likely that another of Shepheard's friends from student days was John Field (1771&#150;1841), the silhouettist, who may well have accompanied him when painting landscapes in Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, and Sussex. He probably visited Ireland about 1807 and Wales in the 1820s, and he was in France in April 1816. During the 1820s he also exhibited subjects from Somerset and Devon, Yorkshire, and Derbyshire. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1811 to the year of his death. The rustic figures that populate Shepheard's landscapes are good, as are his lively caricatures in pen and watercolour. As an engraver he produced mixed-media prints after Henry Bunbury and George Morland, and fifteen plates, <span class="italic">Lady Hamilton's Attitudes</span>, after Frederick Rehberg. In turn, George M. Brighty etched a set, <span class="italic">Vignette Designs</span>, after Shepheard's drawings. There is also a pencil portrait of James Northcote RA&#151;again from the Williams Collection&#151;in the National Portrait Gallery, London.<br>
<br>Shepheard was twice married, first, on 1 March 1800, to Caroline Alexandria Anderson and second to Amelia Anderson, whose elder sister Augusta had married his elder brother Captain Lewis Shepheard RN (<i>d</i>. 1838). There were three sons and three daughters of the first marriage and a son and daughter of the second. The eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_25329">George [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and the third, Lewis Henry (<i>b</i>. 1816), became artists. The latter presumably had some hopes of succeeding to Hellens, since in 1881, along with several cousins, he took the surname of Wallwyn. George Shepheard died of dropsy on 7 September 1842 at 100 Guilford Street, London, his home since 1821.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25329"></a><span class="headword">George Wallwyn Shepheard</span>  (1804&#150;1852), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, travelled widely on the continent. In 1838 in Florence he married Laura Justina Parigi, with whom he had two children, Wallwyn Poyer Burnett Shepheard (<i>b</i>. 1840), a barrister, and Teresa Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1842). They each married a first cousin. G. W. Shepheard exhibited French and Italian views and free studies at the Royal Academy from 1837 to 1851 and lived in Bloomsbury. He died on 26 January 1852 at 5 Old Steyne, Brighton, of apoplexy and a diseased heart. His wife survived him.<br>
