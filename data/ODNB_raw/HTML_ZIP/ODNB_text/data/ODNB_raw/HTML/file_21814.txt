<span class="headword">Pelling,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1640, <em>d.</em> 1718), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Thomas Pelling (<i>b</i>. 1599/1600) and his wife, Margaret Lovell. Edward was baptized on 21 June 1640 at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, where his father had been rector since 1621. Thomas Pelling refused to swear to the solemn league and covenant in 1643, but he managed to stay on as rector: as he and his family were quitting their house, a sympathetic parliamentary colonel gave him a copy and told him to put it in his pocket, and then proceeded to assure the authorities that upon his own knowledge Pelling had taken the covenant  (Walker, 336). In 1655 the elder Pelling was still in place, though regarded as &#145;both ungodly &amp; insufficient&#146;  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 379). The younger Pelling may have been one of John Walker's correspondents for his account of the sufferings of the clergy.<br>
<br>Edward Pelling was a king's scholar at Westminster School and then was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1658. His coming of age and early education, therefore, took place in the turbulent and confusing interregnum years, which undoubtedly influenced his outlook later in life. He was elected minor fellow of Trinity College in September 1664 and major fellow the following April. He graduated BA in 1662 and proceeded MA in 1665 and DD on the occasion of the visit of the new king, William III, in October 1689. He was vicar of St Helen, Bishopsgate, in London from May 1674, until he was collated to the rectory of St Martin Ludgate in October 1678. He became a prebendary of Westminster in 1683, but resigned both this and his living at St Martin Ludgate when he was presented to the rectory of Petworth, Sussex, in 1691 by Charles Seymour, duke of Somerset, whose chaplain he was. Pelling remained at Petworth until his death in March 1718. He also became chaplain in ordinary to William and Mary, then to Queen Anne, and was elected as the diocese of Chichester's proctor to convocation in 1710. He and his family were well connected to the clerical establishment in Sussex: his son, Thomas, became vicar of Rottingdean, and his two daughters married other clergymen in the county. It appears that the family made a particularly close alliance with the Bettesworth family, which was something of a high-church clerical dynasty in the county. His first wife's name is not recorded, but she is the one who bore his children. She must have died in or before 1710, because that is the year he married on 28 October Margaret Hill, a widow, who died less than four years later.<br>
<br>Pelling could be characterized as a high-churchman, though he was not a nonjuror. He entered the fray of political and religious debate in the late 1670s and early 1680s, first by preaching 30 January sermons that emphasized divine-right monarchy and absolute obedience. In 1680 he published his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Good Old Way</span>, which argued that the Church of England's polity, doctrine, and rites (including high-church practices such as signing the cross and kneeling at communion) were apostolic and approved by God, and that dissenters were simply &#145;Seditious and Brain-sick People&#146;  (p. 7). In 1682 he defended divine-right monarchy, indefeasible hereditary right, and passive obedience. He wrote strongly in favour of Sir Robert Filmer (whose book <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, published in 1680, furnished tories with arguments for a generation) and George Hickes, the nonjuror, and maintained that republicanism was a &#145;Jesuitical Principal&#146;  (Pelling, <span class="italic">The Apostate Protestant</span>, 58). He was clearly frustrated by whig arguments for exclusion, and felt that &#145;true loyalty has been &hellip; reproached for a <i>Crime</i>, and esteemed a kind of <i>Treason</i> against the <i>People</i> to be Dutiful to the <i>king</i>&#146;  (Pelling, <span class="italic">Sermon Preached at St. Mary Le Bow</span>, 4). In 1685 he preached a thanksgiving sermon for James's victory over Monmouth, in which he likened James to the biblical King David. He had argued as early as 1679, however, that God sometimes allowed kings to be removed by violence and conquest  (Pelling, <span class="italic">Sermon Preached on the Thirtieth of January 1678/9</span>, 20&#150;24), and this enabled him to acknowledge William and Mary as his sovereigns. Whatever his feelings about the succession, by the early 1690s he was chaplain to their majesties. It is interesting to note that his sermons before the king and queen were markedly different in tone from most of his other printed works. There were none of the combative, defensive apologetics so common in his other works; these sermons were filled rather with platitudes on &#145;vertue&#146;, &#145;felicity&#146;, and &#145;happiness&#146;, and an emphasis on &#145;obedience to Divine Law&#146; and a &#145;life of perfect Love and Peace&#146;  (Pelling, <span class="italic">Sermon Preach'd at White-Hall before the Queen</span>). It appears from this that he felt it necessary to moderate his rhetoric when preaching before the new king, and one wonders if he was entirely comfortable in this role. It is clear, however, that he had not lost all of his pre-revolution zeal: he continued in other contexts to preach in favour of a high view of episcopacy and against dissent and schism, and he voted for tory candidates for parliament in every election until his death.<br>
<br>Pelling died in March 1718 and was buried at Petworth. He was survived by his children: Thomas, vicar of Rottingdean; Martha, wife of Charles Bettesworth, rector of Kingston and Terwick (to whom Pelling gave &pound;848 14<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. worth of South Sea stock in the settling of his estate, which, one hopes, they sold off quickly); and Mary, wife of John Dunstall, rector of Newtimber and South Stoke.<br>
