<span class="headword">Ormesby, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1317), <span class="occ">justice</span>, probably derived his name from one of two adjacent villages of Ormesby (St Michael and St Margaret) in south-east Norfolk, about 5 miles north of Great Yarmouth. Nothing else is known of his origins and, if he inherited any property from his parents, it seems only to have been of very modest extent. His first appearance in the records is probably in 1275 when a William of Ormesby, who is probably to be identified with the future judge (although he had at least one contemporary namesake), made a bid to farm three hundreds in south-east Norfolk. By 1283 Ormesby was being paid a retainer, probably for his professional legal services, by the prior of Norwich. He acted as a serjeant on the Norfolk eyre of 1286 and in the Norfolk assizes at Norwich in 1288, although there is no evidence of his acting as a serjeant in the Westminster bench, either then or later. By 1291 he had entered the service of the earl of Norfolk, subsequently receiving a grant of the contested Yorkshire manor of Thornton in Pickeringlithe from the earl, and he continued to witness the earl's charters for at least a decade after he had entered the king's service. This happened in 1292 when he was appointed a junior justice of the northern eyre circuit led by Hugh Cressingham, who also came from Norfolk. Ormesby was particularly associated with the hearing of crown pleas, and he was also commissioned to hold gaol deliveries to try those who surrendered to justice after the eyres had left the counties concerned. Surviving law reports indicate, however, that he also played a part in the hearing of civil pleas.<br>
<br>Ormesby remained in the king's service after the eyre circuits were suspended in June 1294 and was henceforth regularly appointed both to oyer and terminer commissions and to deliver gaols, mainly in East Anglia but also on occasion elsewhere in the country. He was summoned to the August parliament of 1295, and was sent as a messenger to the king of the Romans later that month. It was also apparently at about this time that he became a knight. At the end of 1295 or early in 1296 he became a justice of the king's bench. He had served there for no more than a year when he was appointed a justice in the newly conquered Scotland, at about the same time that his erstwhile judicial colleague Cressingham was appointed treasurer of Scotland. The beginning of a general revolt of the Scots against the English occupation regime was marked by an attack led by William Wallace against Ormesby while he was holding a session at Scone in May 1297. Ormesby lost all his personal possessions and was lucky to escape with his life. He seems to have fled to England but returned later that summer to Scotland. He had, however, been removed from office in Scotland before the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle at Stirling Bridge at which Cressingham was killed, and was commissioned in October 1297 to levy foot soldiers in the northern counties for service against the Scots.<br>
<br>Late in 1297 or early in 1298 Ormesby was reappointed to the court of the king's bench, and was paid as one of its justices until Michaelmas term 1303, although he left the court to act as one of the justices of the eyres for Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely in 1299, and to act as a justice in the liberty of Durham while it was in the hands of the king in 1302&#150;3. In 1305 and 1306 he was appointed leader of the groups of trailbaston justices who held sessions in his own home county of Norfolk and in Suffolk, and in 1307 he served briefly as justice of Chester. By September 1308 he had been appointed as the senior assize justice for Norfolk and Suffolk and retained that position, although apparently with some intermissions and with Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire later being added to the circuit, until the time of his death. He also continued to be appointed to a variety of other judicial commissions, mainly but not exclusively in the same counties. These included commissions for the enforcement of the <span class="roman">Statute of Winchester</span> and commissions to punish the wrongdoing of local officials. He was appointed a justice both of the abortive Durham eyre of 1311 and of the Kent eyre of 1313&#150;14, where he heard both civil and crown pleas.<br>
<br>William Ormesby was married twice. By 1286 he had married his first wife, Agnes, the heir to a considerable landed estate in Norfolk which included lands in Ormesby. He was almost certainly her second husband. If, as seems probable, she was the mother of Ormesby's son John, the marriage must have taken place some years before 1286, for in 1294 William and Agnes settled two Norfolk manors belonging to Agnes on John and his wife, Katherine, and in 1296 and 1297 John accompanied his father to Scotland. Agnes died not long before Michaelmas term 1306. Between 1306 and 1308 Ormesby married as his second wife Sibyl, the widow of the royal justice Roger Loveday who had died in 1287. She brought him a life interest in extensive lands in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, which had either been settled jointly on Roger and herself or which she held in dower. Ormesby was still alive and capable of transacting business with judicial colleagues on 28 April 1317, but was dead by 12 June 1317, when his executors were instructed to send in to the exchequer his assize and other plea rolls. He was buried in the abbey of St Benet of Hulme, not far from Ormesby, a house of which he had been a benefactor during his lifetime.<br>
