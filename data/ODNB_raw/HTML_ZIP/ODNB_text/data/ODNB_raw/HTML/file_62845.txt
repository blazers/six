<span class="headword">Paul</span> <span class="st"> [P&aacute;ll &THORN;orfinnsson]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1098/9), <span class="occ">earl of Orkney</span>, succeeded to the earldom conjointly with his younger brother, <a name="cosubject_62845"></a><span class="headword">Erlend</span> <span class="st"> [Erlendr &THORN;orfinnsson]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1098/9), <span class="occ">earl of Orkney</span>, on the death of their father, Earl <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49271/', "Thorfinn (II) Sigurdson")</script>, <i>c</i>.1065. They were closely related to the ruling dynasties of Norway and Scotland, their mother, Ingebjorg (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1070), daughter of Finn &Aacute;rnason, being cousin to Thora, wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49272/', "Harald Hardrada, king of Norway")</script>, and their paternal grandmother being a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17858/', "Malcolm II, king of Scots")</script>. Moreover, Ingebjorg is said in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> to have married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17859/', "Malcolm III Canmore")</script> after the death of Earl Thorfinn. Paul, the first earl to have been given a Christian baptismal name, and Erlend are said to have been &#145;tall, handsome men, shrewd and gentle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 31) and taking rather more after their mother's side of the family. They did not divide the earldom initially, being &#145;for the most part on friendly terms&#146;  (ibid., chap. 33), but Paul is specifically said to have been the one who was very much in charge. There is no mention of them having authority or raiding in any of the Scottish or Hebridean or Irish territories controlled by their father, suggesting that&#151;as the saga says&#151;these areas came under local rule and broke away from earldom control after Thorfinn's death.<br>
<br>Paul and Erlend had indeed to cope with a much more energetic exercise of authority by their Norwegian overlords in the earldom than their father had had to face, and soon after his death they were drawn into the ambitious campaign of Harald Hardrada to win the throne of England after the death of Edward the Confessor and the seizure of power by Harold Godwineson. The Norwegian king sailed to Orkney in the summer of 1066 with his fleet of over 200 ships and stayed there for a while gathering more forces; the earls would have been under an obligation to join him with their following of manned ships from their own territories. When the king and the earls sailed south, Harald's queen and his daughter remained behind in the Orkneys. Having raided the coastal parts of Northumbria <i>en route</i> for York, the Norwegian and Orcadian fleet then anchored at Riccall on the River Wharfe and launched an attack against Earl Morcar at the gates of York on 20 September. Four days later Harald and his Norwegian forces went to York to receive the submission of the city, leaving Paul and Erlend, along with the young &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson, in charge of the ships. At Stamford Bridge the invading force was confronted by the English army, which had marched north with King Harold II (Harold Godwineson), and was defeated in the ensuing battle, in which the Norwegian king was killed. Somewhat surprisingly, as the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> tells, quarter was given &#145;to Olaf, the son of the king of the Norwegians, to their bishop, to the earl of Orkney, and to all those who were left aboard the ships&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 1066, text D). They had, however, to go to meet King Harold to swear oaths that they would maintain peace and friendship, and &#145;the king let them sail home with twenty-four ships&#146;  (ibid.). &Oacute;l&aacute;f spent that winter in Orkney &#145;on the friendliest terms with the earls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chaps. 33, 34) before returning to take power jointly with his brother Magn&uacute;s in Norway.<br>
<br>Paul's support for the episcopal structures established in the earldom by his father can be seen from a letter written (before 1073) by Thomas, archbishop of York, in which the earl is named (the first earl to be named in a non-Norse source) as having sent a bishop to him for consecration. This letter leaves no doubt about the earl's control over episcopal appointments, and shows that he concurred with York's claim over the Orkney diocese (although this may have been because the alternative archbishopric, Hamburg, was vacant at this time). It is unlikely that the two earls were supporting rival candidates, although that appears to have been the situation in the twelfth century.<br>
<br>Earl Paul married a daughter of the powerful Norwegian <i>jarl</i>, H&aacute;kon &Iacute;varsson, and of Ragnhild, daughter of King Magn&uacute;s the Good. Paul and his wife had one son and four daughters. The son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65444/', "H&#225;kon")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37728/', "Magn&#250;s Erlendsson (1075/&#150;1116?)")</script>], named after his maternal grandfather, wanted to be foremost among all the cousins, considering himself &#145;more highly-born than the others&#146;. Earl Erlend, however, &#145;wasn't going to see his sons back down to anyone there in the islands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 34): so differences arose between the cousins and although their fathers tried to keep the peace they eventually parted on hostile terms. At a peace meeting held on the mainland of Orkney (perhaps at Tingwall) they agreed to divide Orkney into two parts&#151;as in the time of earls Thorfinn (II) and Br&uacute;si. It seems clear that Erlend and his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37728/', "Magn&#250;s")</script> and Erling, commanded more support at this time, for H&aacute;kon was induced to leave the islands and he went first to Norway where he visited King &Oacute;l&aacute;f towards the end of his life (1091&#150;2), and then to Sweden. <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> also says that while H&aacute;kon was in exile Erlend and his sons had control of everything and Paul &#145;took little part in governing the earldom&#146;  (chap. 37).<br>
<br>H&aacute;kon Paulsson is represented in the saga as being the instigator of the first expedition west undertaken by King Magn&uacute;s Barelegs of Norway, in 1098, primarily to assert royal authority in Orkney and the Hebrides. Once more Paul and Erlend had to face the arrival of their Norwegian overlord in their earldom, but on this occasion there was direct action to bring the islands under royal control. The highly unusual step was taken of sending the two earls to Norway&#151;under duress&#151;and the young royal prince Sigurd was made overlord of the islands &#145;with regents to govern the earldom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 39). Magn&uacute;s continued west on his successful raiding expedition and took H&aacute;kon Paulsson and the Erlendssons in his retinue, clearly to tie them into his own military following as a preliminary to tightening royal control over the earldom. Authority was also asserted over the Hebrides, where the Norwegian entourage spent the winter. When King Magn&uacute;s sailed north to Orkney the next spring he heard that Erlend had died and been buried at Trondheim, while &#145;Earl Paul was buried at Bergen&#146;  (ibid., chap. 42). According to <span class="italic">Magnus Barelegs' Saga</span> Erlend died of disease.<br>
