<span class="headword">Vansittart <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lowe]</span>,  Henrietta</span>  (1833&#150;1883), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born in Ewell, Surrey, the third in the family of six daughters and two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17082/', "James Lowe (1798&#150;1866)")</script>, a smoke-jack maker and inventor, and his wife, Mary (1804&#150;1871), the eldest daughter of George Barnes of Ewell, builder. Her education is unknown, although both parents had connections with the Seymours of Syon House. By 1852 James Lowe was reduced to poverty and Bermondsey had become a slum. On 25 July 1855 in the British embassy, Paris, Henrietta married Frederick Vansittart (<i>d</i>. 1902), a lieutenant of the 14th dragoons, the son of William Vansittart of the Shottesbrooke family of White Waltham. They had no children. He sold his commission in 1856 and bought 18 Clarges Street, London. Henrietta did not lose interest in her impecunious father and within two years she was with him aboard HMS <i>Bullfinch</i> for the trials of his new screw propeller. By 1859 she and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17314/', "Edward Bulwer Lytton, first Baron Lytton (1803&#150;1873)")</script> were having a secret affair. In 1860 Benjamin Disraeli thought she had such a hold on Lytton that it was affecting his attendance at the house. The friendship lasted until 1871.<br>
<br>Following her father's death in October 1866 Vansittart carried on his pioneering work on the development of the screw propeller for steamships. In 1868 she obtained patent no. 2877 for the Lowe-Vansittart propeller. <span class="italic">The Times</span> of 24 September 1869 reported the Admiralty trials of the propeller when fitted to HMS <i>Druid</i>, and the part played by Vansittart even though she was a married woman. In 1871 the Lowe-Vansittart propeller was awarded a first-class diploma at the Kensington exhibition, and similar awards followed worldwide. Meanwhile it had been fitted to many warships and liners, including the <i>Scandinavian</i> and <i>Lusitania</i>.<br>
<br>Vansittart's obituary in the <span class="italic">Journal of the London Association of Foreman Engineers and Draughtsmen</span> recalled that &#145;she was a remarkable personage with a great knowledge of engineering matters and considerable versatility of talent&#146;, and:<blockquote>how cheery and thoughtful for the happiness of others she was &hellip; she was the only lady, it is believed, who ever wrote and read a scientific paper, illustrated by diagrams and drawings made by herself, before the members of a Scientific Institution.</blockquote>This referred to a paper presented in 1876.In September 1882 Vansittart visited the Tynemouth exhibition. She did not pay the &pound;600 for renewal of her patent, and the day after it was due was ordered by magistrates to be detained in the county lunatic asylum at Coxlodge, Gosforth, near Newcastle upon Tyne, having been found wandering by the police. She died there on 8 February 1883 of acute mania and anthrax.<br>
