<span class="headword">Cockburn,  Patrick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1568), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Choicelee, Berwickshire, in the early years of the sixteenth century, the second of the five sons of Christopher Cockburn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1520) and his wife, Margaret Hoppringle. The family was a cadet branch of the Cockburns of Langton. The head of the house, Cockburn's uncle Sir William Cockburn, was slain at Flodden in 1513. Cockburn matriculated at the University of St Andrews on 24 February 1526, and graduated BA in the same year (deferment of formal matriculation until graduation was not uncommon at the time). Afterwards he went to Paris to complete his education, and excelled in the study of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. On his return to Scotland it seems likely that he was engaged to teach at his old university. He was also appointed prebendary of Pitcox in the collegiate church of Dunbar, Haddingtonshire, in which capacity he was present at the election of his kinswoman Janet Hoppringle as prioress of Coldstream, Berwickshire, on 23 February 1538.<br>
<br>In 1548 Cockburn was one of the attendants licensed to go to France with Lord James Stewart (afterwards earl of Moray), commendator of St Andrews Priory and probably a student of his. For most of the following decade Cockburn divided his time between St Andrews and Paris, where he became professor of oriental languages at the Sorbonne. While there he published two doctrinal works: <span class="italic">Oratio de utilitate et excellentia verbi Dei</span> (1551), with a dedicatory epistle to his friend John Hamilton, archbishop of St Andrews, in which he reflects, among other things, on the pleasure he derives from teaching; and <span class="italic">De vulgari sacrae scripturae phrasi</span> (1552), with a dedicatory epistle to Lord James Stewart, who in the same year granted him a pension of &pound;50 per annum from the rents of the kirk of Leuchars in Fife. The former work was popular enough to be translated into French by Jacques Vincent in 1553. At St Andrews Cockburn published <span class="italic">In Dominicam orationem pia meditatio</span> (1555), believed to be the first printed book to mention Mary, queen of Scots, by name. On 15 November 1557 Cockburn was one of several persons elected to an academic committee of his old college, St Mary's, at the University of St Andrews. He was in Paris in April 1558, once more in the company of his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Lord James Stewart, to attend the wedding of Queen Mary and the dauphin (afterwards Fran&ccedil;ois II). He remained there to see through the press a second and much enlarged edition of <span class="italic">De vulgari sacrae scripturae phrasi</span> in July.<br>
<br>Cockburn, who had always leaned towards the reformers, openly joined the protestant party at the advent of the Reformation in Scotland in the following year. In 1561 he published <span class="italic">In secundae partis catechismi (quae est de simbolo quod apostolicum vocant) enarrationem, de fide, et iustificatione, praefatio</span>, part of a much longer work which, in the foreword, Cockburn complains he has not money to publish. In 1562 he became first protestant minister of Haddington, a post he held until his death. It is inconceivable that he would not have known John Knox, a native of Haddington, who must have preached there many times. Along with Thomas Hepburn, David Lindsay, and John Craig, Cockburn was appointed in 1562 to preach in the unplanted kirks (that is, those lacking ministers) of the Merse in Berwickshire. In the same year his name was mentioned for the superintendency of Jedburgh; and in 1563 he was appointed chaplain of Trinity aisle in the parish of Haddington.<br>
<br>Cockburn died at Haddington in 1568 and was buried there. He was renowned in his lifetime for his learning and erudition, as also, in marked contrast to the tenor of the age, for his moderation and humanity.<br>
