<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sibbes <span class="st"> [Sibs]</span>,  Richard</span>  (1577?&#150;1635), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in 1577 according to his friend Zachary Catlin, although statements of his age at various dates place his birth anywhere between 1576 and 1581; the claim that he was baptized at Tostock, Suffolk, on 6 January 1580 lacks evidence. His parents, Paul Sibbes (<i>d</i>. 1610), wheelwright, of Tostock, and his wife, Joane, moved their family 2 miles west to the town of Thurston while he was still young. He was educated locally, attending first the petty school at Pakenham run by Richard Brigs, a graduate of St John's College, Cambridge, and then the well-known King Edward VI Free School at nearby Bury St Edmunds. Catlin recorded that Paul Sibbes was persuaded to continue Richard's education only because of &#145;the Importunity of Friends&#146;. &#145;His father at length grew weary of his expense for booke-learning&#146; and made an investment in some tools for him, so that he could be set up in his own trade. But the younger Sibbes seemed ill-suited to it. Walking home from school, while his friends played games, Sibbes would &#145;take out of his Pocket or Sachel, one Book or other, and so to goe reading and meditating, til he came to his Father's house, which was neere a mile of, and so as he went to schole agen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.cxxxv).<h2>
<a name="Cambridge15951617"></a>Cambridge, 1595&#150;1617</h2>In 1595, perhaps due to the influence of John Knewstub, rector of Cockfield, Suffolk, Sibbes matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge. During his years as an undergraduate an allowance of just over &pound;8 per year from his father was supplemented by aid from friends and a sub-sizarship from the college. He graduated BA in 1599. Not quite two years later, on 3 April 1601, he was admitted as a foundress fellow of St John's and in 1602 he proceeded MA. He served in a variety of college posts, including Fell chaplain and sublector (1603), examiner (subject unspecified, 1604&#150;8), Lady Margaret chaplain (1612&#150;18), and Dr Thompson chaplain (1612&#150;18), and he was also taxor for the university in 1608. In 1615 he was elected both senior dean and lector domesticus of St John's College. In 1619, when he had already left for London, he was elected senior fellow.<br>
<br>At some point, probably soon after he became a fellow of St John's, Sibbes's life changed direction. &#145;It pleased God to convert him by the Ministry of Master Paul Baines, whilest he was Lecturer at Saint Andrews in Cambridge&#146;  (Clarke, 143). On 21 February 1608 he was ordained deacon and priest and on 1 March 1609 he was elected as a college preacher, whose duties included preaching to the townspeople. Despite his stuttering, he evidently succeeded and gained wide repute as a preacher. In 1610 Sibbes was created BD. That same year the minister, churchwardens, and twenty-nine other parishioners of Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, established a public lecture for the town by popular subscription, to be held in the church at one o'clock on Sunday afternoon; on 22 November they offered the position to Sibbes at a salary of &pound;40 a year. When he preached Holy Trinity was so crowded that a new gallery needed to be built to accommodate his listeners.<br>
<br>It has long been asserted that Sibbes subsequently lost his positions in Cambridge due to his puritan convictions, but, the confusion of later scholars notwithstanding, he was not deprived of his fellowship at St John's in 1615. The college rental books record quarterly payments to him as a fellow continuously through the first quarter of 1626. Nor is there evidence that Sibbes was deprived of the Holy Trinity lectureship. A memorandum from the vice-chancellor's court dated 6 December 1616 relates that when he &#145;was asked by Mr Vice-Chancellor whether he would subscribe to the 3 articles required to be subscribed unto by the Canons [of 1604] [he] refused&#146;. Answers to diverse accompanying questions supplied in Sibbes's own hand explained, &#145;I said that the signe of the cross [in baptism] was dangerous&#146;, but qualified his reservations to a significant degree. &#145;My meaning was in regard of those that be not well instructed and not otherwise. I said that there is nihil impie in the booke of ordination. I add it is not contrary to the word of God, but allowable&#146;  (Cambridge University Archives, vice-chancellor's court, I.42, fol. 202). The next day, John Hills, master of St Catharine's College and vice-chancellor, wrote to James Montagu, bishop of Winchester, stating that &#145;Mr. Sibbs at first made Some Quastion and Seemed lesse Setled in Opinion, but upon a Second conference he also Submitted and Subscribed&#146;  (Cambridge University Archives, letters 11.A.A.8.d).<h2>
<a name="LondonandCambridge16171635"></a>London and Cambridge, 1617&#150;1635</h2>Less than two months later, on 5 February 1617, by the influence of Sir Henry Yelverton, Sibbes was chosen preacher (or lecturer, or reader of divinity) of Gray's Inn, London. By 1624 his ministry had been so well-received that, just as at Holy Trinity Church, the auditorium had to be enlarged. His presence at Gray's Inn was crucial to the growth of his network of friendships. Such a prominent platform gave opportunity for both his reputation and his influence to increase beyond what was possible simply as a provincial lecturer.<br>
<br>Sibbes did more than preach in London. In 1625 he was part of a group of twelve Londoners who formed themselves into an unincorporated, self-perpetuating group of trustees in order to &#145;raise funds with which to acquire ecclesiastical revenue in the hands of laymen to be used for the maintenance and relief of a godly, faithful, and painstaking ministry&#146;, particularly in borough towns  (Calder, vii). As they gained control of livings, these feoffees did not simply fill vacancies with any duly ordained clergyman; they wanted godly preachers to fill the pulpits. The feoffees worked to that end for eight years, collecting more than &pound;6000 and funding eighteen preachers in eleven counties. In February 1633, after lengthy hearings, the feoffees for impropriations were dissolved in the court of exchequer for having formed a self-perpetuating corporation without having obtained a royal charter. While judiciously observing his obligations to the church, Sibbes was not beyond trying the boundaries of those obligations, or at least working apart from them.<br>
<br>In 1626 Sibbes was appointed to the mastership of St Catharine's College, Cambridge. The college prospered under his leadership. He brought in increased numbers of students, large benefactions, and successfully promoted new construction. Although residing in Cambridge sometimes, Sibbes maintained his post and chambers at Gray's Inn. He also continued to be active in London circles. On 2 March 1627, with William Gouge, William Taylor, and John Davenport, Sibbes circulated a letter appealing for aid especially for the destitute ministers from the upper Palatinate. For their efforts, Sibbes and his co-petitioners were brought before Laud and the high commission and reprimanded. While such aid was not inconsistent with English foreign policy to help the protestants on the continent, publicly circulating a letter could have been seen as an inappropriately direct involvement of private persons in state affairs, and as therefore implicit criticism of government inactivity. Nevertheless, Sibbes continued to prosper. On 9 October 1627 he proceeded DD at Cambridge. On 1 November 1633 he was presented by the crown to the perpetual curacy of Holy Trinity, Cambridge. This was to be his last new appointment.<h2>
<a name="Deathandwritings"></a>Death and writings</h2>Sibbes preached his final sermon at Gray's Inn, on 28 June 1635. That evening he fell sick. Samuel Hartlib noted that in Sibbes's final days he was unshaken: &#145;being asked how hee &hellip; did in his soule replied I should doe God much wrong if I should not say very well&#146;  (Hartlib, &#145;Ephemerides&#146;, 1635). He was obviously in control of his mental faculties. He finished his preface to <span class="italic">The Soul's Conflict, and Victory over itself by Faith</span>, the following Wednesday, 1 July, at Gray's Inn. Catlin reported that &#145;his Physitian, that knew his Body best&#146; was &#145;then out of the Citty&#146;. On Saturday, 4 July, Sibbes clearly knew himself to be dying. That day he revised his will, being &#145;weake in body, but of perfect memory&#146;, leaving his goods to family, friends, and servants at Gray's Inn. In his chamber at Gray's Inn, on 5 July 1635, Sibbes died. He had never married. His body was buried the next day in St Andrew's, Holborn, where the members of Gray's Inn had maintained a chapel from medieval times. His funeral sermon, preached by William Gouge, has not survived.<br>
<br>Sibbes prefaced thirteen volumes of sermons, including those by Paul Baynes, Ezekiel Culverwell, John Preston, John Smith, Henry Scudder, Thomas Gataker, Robert Jenison, John Ball, and Richard Capel. His own sermons were either published or reprinted almost every year from 1618 to 1664. While over thirty volumes appeared in his lifetime, most were collected and published after his death, many collected and edited, at Sibbes's request, by Thomas Goodwin and Philip Nye. His most celebrated and frequently reprinted work&#151;both during his life and afterwards&#151;is <span class="italic">The Bruised Reed and Smoking Flax</span>, a series of sermons on the words of Isaiah quoted by Jesus in <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 12: 20, &#145;A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.&#146; From the book's first printing (1630) to the most recent reprint (1998), the tender meditations of <span class="italic">The Bruised Reed</span> have been devotional favourites. The most recent edition of his collected works (1862&#150;4; repr. 1973&#150;83) fills seven volumes.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Sibbes has been presented as one of a number of early Stuart preachers who neither approved nor practised kneeling in communion, wearing the surplice, or signing the cross in baptism, and yet who remained within the established church. He was, it has been reported, constantly troubled by William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury. Doubly deprived, censured, and silenced, Sibbes was supposed to have been a model for his numerous disciples&#151;such as Thomas Goodwin, John Davenport, and John Cotton&#151;who later found their way into dissent. It has been supposed that only the power of his lawyer friends and noble patrons allowed him to retain his later ministry at Gray's Inn for almost two decades. After his death, his writings became almost entirely the possession of nonconformists, and Sibbes came to be read through separatist spectacles.<br>
<br>Although Sibbes was popular, even celebrated, during his life, his thought could hardly be said to have been seminal, nor his career determinative for the fortunes of the godly in early Stuart England. Contrary to previous presentations of him, it now appears that Sibbes did subscribe to the three articles, conform, and retain his positions in Cambridge. His move to London in 1617 is much more explicable in terms of his talent for fostering friendships, combined with his obvious abilities as a preacher. His sociability certainly helps to account for his successes with the feoffees (before their dissolution) and at St Catharine's College, and perhaps for much more. It does not, however, suggest any religious radicalism which would encourage separation. Radicalism is also ruled out when account is taken of his explicit defences of the Church of England (for example, his <span class="italic">Consolatory Letter to an Afflicted Conscience</span>), together with the general tone of his writing and indeed the direction of his whole career.<br>
<br>Yet as godly preaching&#151;which Sibbes had taken to be quite literally the salvation of the Church of England&#151;became increasingly hindered by those in authority, his own position in the church certainly appeared more incongruous. His loyalty to the Church of England was consistent with his theology. He understood the church to be a covenant community far more extensive than the elect, intended to be filled with people in various spiritual states. Therefore imperfection was expected and tolerated, though not excused, and the use of means vigorously encouraged. Indeed, even more than creation, the covenant obliged one to live a life of holiness. Sibbes's interiorization of piety&#151;not unique to Sibbes, but powerfully communicated in his sermons&#151;accounts at the same time for his popularity with disparate groups, his ability to conform to the demands of the church, and yet also for the potential for a Christianity lived in disobedience to ungodly earthly authorities. Ironically, all of the misrepresentations of Sibbes as a doubly deprived puritan legend have led to a very different impression of him from what is gathered by reading his writings and contemporary testimonies about his character and temperament. Yet, with the deprivations removed from the foreground, the conciliating tone of his writings begins to appear more consistent with his own person, and his later preferments become more understandable. The picture of Sibbes which results&#151;of Sibbes as a reformer, but a cautious reformer, as a puritan, but a moderate puritan&#151;is consistent with the rest of Sibbes's life and activities.<br>
