<span class="headword">Lower,  Richard</span>  (1631&#150;1691), <span class="occ">physician and physiologist</span>, was born at Tremeer House, near Bodmin, Cornwall, the son of Humphry or Humfry Lower (<i>bap</i>. 1597, <i>d</i>. 1683) and Margery Billing (<i>d</i>. 1686). He was baptized at St Tudy's, Cornwall, on 29 January 1632. A prominent and affluent Cornish family, the Lower clan included Sir William Lower, a poet and dramatist. Richard's younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17093/', "Thomas Lower")</script>, was also a physician, whose religious beliefs led to his imprisonment with George Fox, the Quaker leader.<br>
<br>Lower's early education was at Westminster School under the tutelage of Richard Busby. In 1649 he received a studentship to Christ Church, Oxford, and matriculated on 27 February 1651. He graduated BA on 17 February 1653, proceeding MA in June 1655, and BM and MD on 28 June 1665. While at Oxford, Lower was praelector in Greek (1656&#150;7) and censor in natural philosophy (1657&#150;60), and by 1659 he had established an active medical practice there. During his Oxford years he secured his reputation as a skilled medical scientist, particularly through his work with Thomas Willis, Sedleian professor of natural philosophy. For much of his period at Oxford, Lower worked as research assistant to Willis, a collaboration that yielded numerous important neuroanatomical and physiological advances. Lower also studied chemistry under Peter Stahl. Following in the experimental traditions of William Harvey, Lower and Willis were part of an extraordinary scientific circle at Oxford that, during the 1650s and 1660s, included Robert Boyle, Christopher Wren, and John Mayow. From this background Lower emerged as one of the most talented and important medical researchers in the history of physiology and anatomy, a position derived from his insistence on careful experimentation and direct observation. Lower relied heavily on vivisection of animals to study physiological questions, and his publications were characterized by a terse, clear writing style. Lower continued his association with Oxford until 1666, when, following Willis, he relocated to London to establish a medical practice. On 17 November 1666 Richard married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1704), daughter of John Billing of Hengar, and widow of Samuel Trelawny.<br>
<br>Lower maintained his research activities for several years after arriving in London, primarily through his involvement with the Royal Society, whose meetings he attended as early as 1666. In May 1667 Boyle formally introduced Lower to the society, and on 17 October of that year Lower was elected a fellow. In November 1667 the society offered him the position of curator, but he declined the appointment. Many of Lower's most important medical contributions were presented at the Royal Society, but in less than two years after becoming a member, his participation in the society declined notably. He ceased regular attendance by March 1669 and resigned his fellowship in 1678. As his research activities waned, Lower devoted himself increasingly to clinical medicine, where he soon established a prominent and lucrative practice in London. Lower lived initially at Hatton Garden, but as his practice thrived, he relocated to increasingly fashionable addresses, including Salisbury Court near Fleet Street, Bow Street, and finally to King Street near Covent Garden. On 22 December 1671 he was a candidate for the College of Physicians, where he became a fellow on 29 July 1675. His practice eventually involved royal appointments, and he became increasingly active in the political intrigues of the times. Following the death of Thomas Willis in 1675, Lower was appointed royal physician. At that time Anthony Wood noted that Lower was &#145;esteemed the most noted physician in Westminster and London, and no man's name was more cried up at court than his&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, new edn, 1813&#150;20, 4.297). Eventually, however, Lower's strongly held political opinions adversely affected his medical career, as his protestant religious beliefs and close affiliation with the whig party led to his loss of court appointments and a considerable decline in his reputation and practice. Lower actively opposed the policies of James II, who once remarked that he &#145;did him more mischief than a troop of horse&#146;  (Gunther, p. xxv), although Lower seems to have spent much of his time in Cornwall while James was in power. Following the revolution of 1688, Lower was again involved with the court, providing advice to the crown regarding medical services for the navy.<br>
<br>Lower's reputation in neuroanatomy derives principally from his collaborative research with Thomas Willis, whose <span class="italic">Cerebri anatome</span> (1664) was a major landmark in descriptive anatomy of the central and the autonomic nervous systems. Willis and Lower had begun their research as early as 1658 and by January 1661 were actively involved in dissection studies with the intent of publishing a book summarizing their studies. Their research continued until summer 1663, with Christopher Wren providing the illustrations for the text. The <span class="italic">Cerebri anatome</span> contained the first functional account of the cerebral blood circulation and provided a detailed description of the basal ganglia, medulla, cerebellum, and ten of the twelve cranial nerves, as well as an account of the vagus nerve and sympathetic nervous system. Although several of Lower's contemporaries claimed that he deserved more credit than Willis for the book, it appears that Willis was responsible for the organization and interpretation of their studies, while Lower performed most of the exacting dissections. In the preface to <span class="italic">Cerebri anatome</span>, Willis praised Lower as &#145;an anatomist of supreme skill&#146; whose &#145;most skillful dissecting hand&#146; and &#145;indefatigable Industry, and unwearied Labour&#146; had provided Willis with the data needed to describe the &#145;structure and function of bodies, whose secrets were previously concealed&#146;. The following year Lower published his first book, <span class="italic">Diatribae Thomae Willissi de febribus vindicatio</span> (1665), which aggressively defended concepts earlier proposed by Willis in <span class="italic">Diatribae duae medico-philosophicae</span> (1658&#150;9). Although Lower subsequently changed the views he expressed in the <span class="italic">Diatribae</span> concerning pulmonary circulation, the book indicates his interest in questions of cardiorespiratory function that would later be addressed in his <span class="italic">Tractatus de corde</span>. The <span class="italic">Tractatus</span> contained the results of Lower's extensive physiological research and a summary of his pioneering work in blood transfusion.<br>
<br>Lower is generally credited with being the first to perform successful blood transfusions, despite some lingering uncertainty over priority. Lower's transfusion studies were a logical continuation of work at Oxford by Christopher Wren and Robert Boyle, who, as early as 1656, were using quills and special bladders to inject medications and other fluids into the bloodstream of dogs. By January 1661 Lower mentioned to Boyle an interest in trying to infuse broth into the veins of dogs; and by June 1664, Lower wrote to Boyle concerning plans to experiment on blood transfusion between dogs. Because blood coagulates rapidly after removal from the circulation, prior attempts to transfuse had met with questionable or no success. Lower decided to try direct transfusion from arterial to venous circulation in hopes that clotting could be avoided by minimizing the time that the blood was outside the vascular system. In late February 1665 at Oxford, Lower successfully performed the first direct blood transfusion, involving the transfer of blood from the carotid artery of one live dog into the jugular vein of another. The experiment demonstrated that blood transfusion was possible and that the technique was effective in reviving an animal that would otherwise have died from severe blood loss. A report of the event was conveyed to the Royal Society by September 1666, and Lower's work quickly became the subject of widespread interest and discussion. In November 1666 the dog transfusion experiments were repeated before the Royal Society at Gresham College, London. Accounts of Lower's transfusions were published in November and December of that year in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (vol. 1, pp. 252, 353&#150;8). Meanwhile, Jean-Baptiste Denis, professor of philosophy and mathematics in Paris, had learned of Lower's work as early as 1665, transfused blood between calves and dogs, and published the results in the <span class="italic">Journal des Scavans</span> in March and April 1667 (pp. 69&#150;72, 96). Subsequently, in June 1667, Denis performed the first adequately documented blood transfusions involving human subjects, using sheep blood infused into two volunteers. Denis sent a letter to the Royal Society describing the experiments, which was printed in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> (no. 27, 22 July 1667, pp. 489&#150;504). Denis did not provide any details of the technical methods, and his claim of French priority for the concept of transfusion provoked Henry Oldenburg, secretary of the Royal Society, to suppress the volume and to replace it with his own version of number 27. In response to the experiments that Denis had reported from France, Lower and an associate, Dr Edmund King, successfully transfused sheep blood into a volunteer, Arthur Coga of Cambridge, on 23 November 1667. By the late 1670s, ensuing events in both countries resulted in a ban on transfusions, which effectively prevented clinical research on the subject until the early 1800s.<br>
<br>Lower's investigations in cardiopulmonary physiology and blood transfusion were summarized in his major work, the <span class="italic">Tractatus de corde</span>, containing in its five chapters a succinct exposition of his most important discoveries. The first three chapters reviewed his work on the comparative anatomy and functional physiology of the heart, blood vessels, and lungs. Chapter four contained the results of his experiments in blood transfusion, and chapter five described his concepts on chyle and its transformation into blood. Lower intended to extend the work of William Harvey by addressing questions raised by Harvey that had not yet been resolved. While at Oxford in 1658, Lower and Willis attempted to discover the cause for the commonly recognized difference in colour between venous and arterial blood. Willis in his <span class="italic">Diatribae duae medico-philosophicae</span> proposed that the vivid colour of arterial blood was due to its having become lighter as it &#145;effervesced&#146; out of the left ventricle. At the time it was generally believed that movement of blood in the circulation was due to this spontaneous effervescence rather than to any mechanical pumping by the heart. Although Lower initially accepted this concept, his extensive comparative anatomy studies of the heart and a series of elegant experiments led him to conclusions that differed quite dramatically from traditional notions. In October 1667 Lower began collaborative work with Robert Hooke using vivisection studies on dogs, which demonstrated that the colour change in blood occurred during its passage through the lungs and that &#145;penetration of particles of air into the blood&#146; were responsible for this alteration. Lower further concluded that the heart was a muscle, whose structure and function were designed to propel blood through the circulation by contractile and expulsive movements. His investigations in comparative anatomy delineated the muscular nature of the heart and its nerve supply in man and other vertebrates. Lower also measured the velocity of blood movements through the circulation and attempted to calculate cardiac output.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Tractatus</span> gained rapid acceptance as an important work in cardiopulmonary physiology. In his <span class="italic">De sanguinis accensione</span> (1670) Willis subsequently abandoned his earlier concepts about the roles of the heart and lungs and embraced Lower's findings and conclusions, and John Mayow revealed his debt to the book in his own <span class="italic">Tractatus quinque</span> (1674). The <span class="italic">Tractatus de corde</span> was translated into English and French, and sixteen editions were published, continuing its recognition well into the mid-eighteenth century as an important scientific study.<br>
<br>Subsequent works by Lower included <span class="italic">Dissertatio de origine catarrhi</span> (1670), which summarized experiments he had conducted with Willis to demonstrate that nasal secretions were not due to the discharge of fluid from cerebral ventricles through the palate, a concept that had been widely held at the time. Other publications attributed to Lower include <span class="italic">Bromographia</span> (1669) and <span class="italic">Receipts, or Dr Lower's and Several other Eminent Physicians Receipts</span> (1700).<br>
<br>Lower contracted a fever after attempting to extinguish a chimney fire at his home in King Street, and died, probably from pneumonia, on 17 January 1691. His body was returned to Cornwall and interred at the church of St Tudy on 3 February. He was survived by his wife and two daughters, Loveday and Philippa, neither of whom married. Lower remains best known for his seminal contributions to neuroanatomy, cardiopulmonary physiology, and blood transfusion.<br>
