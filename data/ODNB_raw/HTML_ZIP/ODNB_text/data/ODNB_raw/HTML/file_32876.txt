<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Douglas,  (William) Sholto</span>, Baron Douglas of Kirtleside  (1893&#150;1969), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born in Oxford on 23 December 1893, the second of the three sons of the Revd Robert Langton Douglas (1864&#150;1952), secretary of the Church of England Temperance Society, and his first wife, Margaret Jane (<i>d</i>. 1958), the daughter of Percival Cannon, a printer. His father left the priesthood in 1898 after his marriage to Margaret Douglas was dissolved (his first divorce), and later became an authority on the history of Italian art, director of the Irish National Gallery, a citizen of the United States, and a Roman Catholic; he was married twice more and&#151;according to Douglas's reckoning&#151;fathered a total of ten legitimate and eight illegitimate children. Brought up in straitened circumstances by his mother, Douglas overcame the handicap of unsettled early years to flourish at St Clement's School, Headington, Oxford; Emmanuel School, Wandsworth; and Tonbridge preparatory school and Tonbridge School in Kent (1908&#150;13), where he won a classical scholarship to Lincoln College, Oxford, in October 1913. He sang in the Bach Choir, attended Fabian Society meetings, and joined the artillery section of the Oxford University officer training corps.<h2>
<a name="FirstWorldWarthewesternfront"></a>First World War: the western front</h2>Douglas was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 15 August 1914 and served in France, but transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as an observer with 2 squadron at Merville in northern France (flying BE 2a and b reconnaissance biplanes) from December 1914 to April 1915. He returned to England for pilot instruction in May and qualified in July. In August he was posted to 8 squadron on the western front, where he was promoted captain and flight commander in December and awarded a Military Cross in January 1916. On promotion to major in May he was sent to Montrose on the Scottish east coast where he formed and trained 43 squadron (equipped with the oddly named Sopwith One and a Half Strutter, a versatile machine, used for bombing and reconnaissance), which he took to France in January 1917. He was appointed to command 84 squadron, equipped with the SE 5a, an excellent single-seat fighter, in August. By the end of the war he was a lieutenant-colonel (promoted on 9 November 1918), a proven administrator, and an experienced pilot (awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross in February 1919), but he met with surprisingly little success in aerial combat: he achieved certainly fewer than the five victories which identify an ace, and perhaps none at all. In later years, however, he rated his performance during the First World War very highly: &#145;I was a well-known fighter pilot and an expert on air fighting when in its infancy&#146;, he told the literary agent A. D. Peters, on 29 March 1961. &#145;I commanded two crack fighter squadrons [the Sopwith was not a fighter] on the Western Front for a total period of nearly two years and was awarded three decorations for gallantry, ending up as the youngest lieutenant-colonel in the RAF at 23 [actually almost 25]&#146;  (Douglas papers).<h2>
<a name="RAFappointmentsbetweenthewars"></a>RAF appointments between the wars</h2>Douglas left the RAF in 1919, but did not return to Oxford to complete a degree. Instead, he joined the Handley Page Company as an air transport pilot, obtaining a commercial pilot's licence and flying from London to Manchester and Brussels. In October 1919 he married May Howard. A chance meeting with Sir Hugh Trenchard, chief of the air staff (CAS), encouraged him to return to the service in March 1920 with a permanent commission as a squadron leader. Trenchard decided to present a &#145;tournament&#146; at Hendon, a display of flying skill, and Douglas suggested a fly-past by three four-engined Handley Page V/1500 bombers. He and Keith Park flew two of the machines on 3 July 1920 in what the editor of <span class="italic">The Aeroplane</span> regarded as the highlight of the show. &#145;It was truly a terrifying sensation&#146;, he wrote, &#145;as the twelve Rolls-Royce Eagles roared towards the railings&#146;  (7 July 1920, 5), clearing them by no more than 15 feet. Trenchard delivered a stinging rebuke to all concerned. Nevertheless, both Douglas and Park were selected to attend the world's first air force staff college, at Andover in Hampshire, from April 1922 to January 1923&#151;long enough to offer practical instruction in efficient management of paperwork and to sow the seeds of a &#145;school of thought&#146;. Among the twenty officers selected were seven who occupied vital positions during the Second World War, but even in that august company three stood out: Charles Portal, Douglas, and Park&#151;and among their instructors was Wilfrid Freeman, one of the RAF's greatest officers.<br>
<br>Douglas's education was further broadened in 1927 by a year at the Imperial Defence College (IDC) in London. He won the prestigious and well-rewarded (&pound;30 plus books) R. M. Groves memorial prize in 1928 for an essay on how aircraft could best help to develop imperial communications. He served in the Middle East, mainly in Egypt and the Sudan, from August 1929 until March 1932, when he returned to the IDC as an instructor. His first marriage was dissolved in 1932, and in September 1933 he married Joan Leslie, the daughter of Colonel Hubert Cuthbert Denny.<br>
<br>In January 1936 Douglas began an exceptionally long stint in the Air Ministry: first as director of staff duties (responsible for framing and amending the tasks assigned to senior operational and staff officers) until February 1938; next as assistant CAS until April 1940 (where his daily concerns were weapons and equipment, including the possibility of airborne radar, for the new fighters and bombers coming into service); and finally as deputy CAS (involved in operational policy at the highest level) until 25 November 1940. He then succeeded Sir Hugh Dowding as head of Fighter Command at Bentley Priory in Stanmore, north-west London. Appropriate promotions accompanied his rise towards the top: wing commander (January 1925), group captain (January 1932), air commodore (July 1935), air vice-marshal (January 1938), and air marshal (on arrival at Bentley Priory). He was appointed CB in July 1940 and knighted (KCB) a year later.<h2>
<a name="HeadofFighterCommand"></a>Head of Fighter Command</h2>By October 1940 moves to replace Dowding at Fighter Command were gathering momentum. He had failed to settle a bitter&#151;and increasingly public&#151;quarrel between his two principal group commanders (Keith Park and Trafford Leigh-Mallory) over the most effective tactics to employ against German daylight raids during the battle of Britain. The Germans had switched to an increasingly destructive night offensive in September, and Dowding seemed at a loss, energetic only in brusquely rejecting Air Ministry suggestions made (or at least supported) by Douglas. Several powerful men, among them Trenchard, Sir John Salmond (also a former CAS, currently conducting an investigation into the problems of night defence), Sir Archibald Sinclair (secretary of state for air), and Harold Balfour (his under-secretary), wanted Dowding's head&#151;and that of the CAS, Sir Cyril Newall, long regarded as a lame duck. The situation was ideal for new commanders to step forward: young, confident, articulate, aggressive and (not least) untainted by what Trenchard and others regarded as mistakes in strategy and tactics since the outbreak of war.<br>
<br>Douglas supported Leigh-Mallory's opposition to the emphasis on defence by Dowding and Park throughout the day battle. As far back as 11 August 1938 he had declared that it was &#145;immaterial in the long view whether the enemy bomber is shot down before or after he has dropped his bombs on his objective&#146;  (Orange, 121). Douglas agreed with Leigh-Mallory that targets should be defended primarily by anti-aircraft guns, balloons, and searchlights, while a concentrated attack was prepared by massed fighters on enemy bombers&#151;if necessary, after they had bombed. It was a risky policy, especially given Fighter Command's lack of combat-hardened pilots by October 1940. Douglas, however, never accepted a distinction between flying ability and fighting experience. On 31 October, for example, he wrote that the pilot position had undergone a &#145;kaleidoscopic change&#146; recently: &#145;in the case of Fighter Command we are actually faced with a surplus&#146;. Two days later, Douglas Evill (Dowding's chief staff officer) reported realistically that the command was &#145;at about the lowest ebb in operational pilots&#146;, as opposed to young men who could more or less control high-performance aircraft, at which it could function  (Orange, 107).<br>
<br>Some years later, in February 1956, Douglas was given an opportunity to comment on a draft of Basil Collier's official history of this period, <span class="italic">The Defence of the United Kingdom</span> (1957). Douglas argued that causing heavy casualties and therefore using large forces was one way to diminish and end an assault. Interception before the enemy reached his target obliged the use of small forces and the risk of defeat in detail. In the short run the effect of bombing was minimized by interception, but in the long run the best answer might be to withhold attack until large fighter forces were massed. &#145;Of course, I realise that Dowding and Park were under pressure from the government to try and break up the attacks before they reached their objective at any cost, and that they could not afford to disregard this pressure&#146;  (Orange, 134&#150;5). This political reason (not mentioned by Douglas in 1940) weighed less with Dowding and Park than the military reason. Douglas and his supporters thought constantly in terms of a single raid on a single target. Had that been the normal pattern of the attack, it would certainly have made sense to assemble a massive counter-attack, but the Luftwaffe rarely made it so easy for the defence.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, on 17 October 1940, Douglas had presided (in the absence of the &#145;indisposed&#146; Newall) over an Air Ministry meeting with Dowding and his group commanders that has become famous. The subsequent minutes, about which Park protested in vain, made many critical points concerning the conduct of operations and left no doubt in the minds of Dowding's many opponents that he and Park (who was deemed to be exhausted) should be replaced by Douglas and Leigh-Mallory; Portal should also succeed the ineffectual Newall.<br>
<br>During his Air Ministry days Douglas had clearly recognized that aerial combat in daylight and darkness required completely different machines. He therefore strongly advocated the development of a twin-engined, two-seat machine&#151;the Bristol Beaufighter&#151;for work at night. Its long endurance, heavy armament, and airborne radar helped Britain's defences to take an increasing toll of German bombers before the blitz was suspended in May 1941. And yet as head of Fighter Command Douglas also encouraged the use at night of a single-engined, single-seat day fighter, the Hawker Hurricane. Its long nose, exhaust glare, and short range made it entirely unsuitable for such operations, which served only to illustrate Douglas's commitment to aggression at all costs. From December 1940 onwards, Spitfires and Hurricanes carried out large-scale &#145;sweeps&#146; across the channel, but short-range fighters, denied help from radar chains and the observer corps, proved as vulnerable over occupied Europe as did German fighters over England. As early as 12 February 1941 Douglas was unhappy. &#145;Our idea&#146;, he complained to Leigh-Mallory, &#145;was to go over the other side and leap on the enemy from a great height in superior numbers; instead of which it looks as though we ourselves are being leapt on&#146;  (Orange, 138). Evill vainly urged Douglas to insist on intensive training during this lull in the daylight offensive, rather than on offensive sweeps of little military value over territory where the Luftwaffe had every advantage.<br>
<br>Tragically, Douglas followed Trenchard in his belief that continuous offensive enhanced morale. This belief was bolstered after the German assault on the Soviet Union in June 1941 by the hope&#151;unrealized, in fact&#151;that fighter sweeps might oblige the Luftwaffe to retain strong forces in the west or even withdraw units from the eastern front. Fighter Command lost more pilots and inflicted far fewer casualties in 1941 than during the battle of Britain and achieved no comparable strategic advantage.<br>
<br>The main event of 1942, so far as Fighter Command was concerned, was its participation in the raid on Dieppe in August. An ill-planned and poorly executed venture, it cost more than 4000 casualties, mainly Canadians; Fighter Command lost 106 aircraft, the Luftwaffe only forty-eight. Although Douglas was not among those primarily responsible for the disaster, neither he nor Leigh-Mallory voiced reservations about employing short-range fighters far beyond their bases. Nothing had been learned by either man from their mishandling of the command in 1941. Douglas was promoted air chief marshal in July 1942.<h2>
<a name="RAFMiddleEastandCoastalCommand"></a>RAF Middle East and Coastal Command</h2>In December 1942 Douglas succeeded Sir Arthur Tedder in Cairo as head of RAF Middle East. During 1943 the centre of operations moved westwards, to Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy, and planning for operation Overlord (the allied attempt to liberate western Europe) became serious. But the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, hoped to generate a new campaign in the Balkans and the Dodecanese Islands that might add Turkey to the allied coalition. Although Douglas eagerly supported Churchill's plans, General Dwight D. Eisenhower (supreme allied commander) and his principal army, navy, and air subordinates, General Harold Alexander, Admiral Andrew Cunningham, and Tedder, did not. Such a campaign, they argued, diverted attention from Italy, the short-term target, and Overlord, the long-term target. Tedder's unwavering support for American resistance to operation Accolade helped to ensure him a high place in Overlord. Denis Richards, an official British historian, castigated Accolade: &#145;this rash experiment &hellip; ill-judged from the beginning, had been the result of over-confidence, an unconscious flouting of a cardinal principle of modern warfare&#146;  (Richards and Saunders, 2.345). Douglas and his army and navy colleagues in Cairo did what they could with their own resources and received some assistance from Eisenhower's subordinates, but it was never sufficient. Douglas shared Churchill's intense excitement over these adventures in the eastern Mediterranean, but he&#151;of all men&#151;quite overlooked the fact that the Luftwaffe enjoyed local air superiority, and neither Douglas nor Churchill had a convincing answer to the question asked by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in October 1943: where do the allies go from the Aegean? Accolade collapsed in November, at a cost of some 5000 British casualties, and Turkey remained neutral. The collapse deeply angered Douglas, who even contemplated resignation; he went to his grave convinced that a great opportunity had been wasted by the timidity of others.<br>
<br>While he was still pressing on with his &#145;rash experiment&#146;, Douglas learned that the Americans had vetoed his appointment as allied commander in south-east Asia, an appointment prematurely offered to him by Sinclair with Churchill's approval. The Americans were unimpressed by his conduct of operations at Fighter Command, still less by his support for Accolade, and some of them regarded him as a difficult colleague, overbearing and self-satisfied. Their reservations about Douglas's personality were soon confirmed. During December 1943 it was decided that Lieutenant-General Ira C. Eaker be made first commander-in-chief of the newly formed Mediterranean allied air forces, with Douglas as his deputy. Douglas was upset, although he liked Eaker, &#145;and respected his ability. But it was a strange state of affairs in which an officer of my seniority in high command could be appointed as deputy to an American officer so much junior in rank and experience&#146;  (Douglas papers). Even granting these objections, which are arguable, Douglas overlooked the fact that in a coalition the partner providing most of the equipment and manpower must sometimes be allowed overall command. &#145;Tedder was sympathetic&#146;, Douglas continued, &#145;but the way he expressed it angered me. &#147;The great chess players do not, I think,&#148; he wrote, &#147;have much regard for pawns like you and me.&#148; I have never been able to regard myself as a pawn&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Douglas accepted the position, with a bad grace, but at the last moment Portal offered to bring him back to England in January 1944 as head of Coastal Command&#151;an appointment which delighted him, even though he knew nothing about its highly specialized war against submarines, surface warships, and coastal shipping. Sir John Slessor, an officer of greater ability and wider experience who understood the realities of coalition warfare, took over as Eaker's deputy. Coastal Command had become, under Slessor, a large and successful organization, stretching from Iceland to Gibraltar, and working closely with the Royal Navy. Under Douglas's direction, it kept open for Overlord the vital cross-channel links before and after D-day, 6 June 1944.<h2>
<a name="OccupationofGermanyandretirementfromtheRAF"></a>Occupation of Germany and retirement from the RAF</h2>In August 1945 Douglas was appointed head of British air forces of occupation (BAFO) in Germany under Field Marshal Montgomery. He was responsible for overseeing the disarmament of the Luftwaffe in a devastated land, securing access to the western sectors of Berlin, dealing with Soviet suspicion and reluctance to co-operate in restoring something approaching &#145;normal&#146; life in Germany, and returning Polish and Czech airmen, who had served with the RAF, to their homes&#151;if they still had any. It was an appointment he hated, not only for the long hours and hard travelling, but for the constant sense of wrestling with problems which had no satisfactory solutions in any foreseeable future. Consolation came in January 1946, when he was knighted again (GCB) and promoted to the rank of marshal: only he and Sir Arthur Harris, head of Bomber Command, reached five-star status in RAF history without serving as chiefs of the air staff. In May he succeeded Montgomery as head of all British forces in Germany, military governor of the British zone, and British member of the four-power Allied Control Commission. Although he doubted the propriety of the Nuremberg war trials, he found himself obliged to confirm the sentences passed. He retired in November 1947, ending what he described as the unhappiest period of his life.<br>
<br>Douglas's military career, though distinguished, left him unsatisfied. He arrived in Fighter Command <i>after</i> the battle of Britain, in Egypt <i>after</i> Rommel's last departure, in Coastal Command <i>after</i> victory over the U-boats, and in Germany <i>after</i> the defeat of Hitler. Historians express reservations about his conduct of Fighter Command and his Aegean campaign; he was denied a great allied command in the Far East and, although Churchill often spoke warmly of his merits, both Tedder and Slessor stood ahead of him as candidates for the succession to Portal as CAS.<h2>
<a name="PeerandchairmanofBEA"></a>Peer and chairman of BEA</h2>Douglas was created a peer in February 1948 and sat on the Labour benches. At the suggestion of Lord Pakenham he was appointed a director of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1948, but resigned in March 1949 when he was appointed chairman of British European Airways (BEA), which had been created as a result of the Attlee government's nationalization of civil aviation. His appointment was regularly renewed until 1964. During his time, BEA grew rapidly&#151;from about 750,000 passengers in 1949 to 5.6 million in 1964&#151;and was turned around from making serious losses to a net profit. Under his chairmanship BEA expanded both business and leisure travel into Europe, encouraging demand by introducing reduced tourist fares in 1953, and achieved economies by using larger aircraft. Jet airliners were introduced and commercial agreements were made with companies outside the EEC. The longest-serving, and one of the most successful among chairmen of nationalized industries, he &#145;handled the board and the politicians with a direct firmness which brooked no interference&#146;  (Masefield).<br>
<br>After his second marriage was dissolved in 1954 Douglas married, in 1955, Hazel, the daughter of George Eric Maas Walker and the widow of Captain W. E. R. Walker. They had a daughter, Katherine, Douglas's only child. He produced two volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">Years of Combat</span> and <span class="italic">Years of Command</span>, in 1963 and 1966, with essential assistance from his former personal assistant, Wing Commander Robert Wright. Although valuable, both volumes suffer from the fact that most official records were then withheld from public scrutiny. Douglas was a burly man, well aware that his face usually wore a forbidding frown, which he protested was beyond his power to control. He could certainly be charming, to men as well as women, for he had a powerful personality. He was often ill in his last years and died in hospital in Northampton on 29 October 1969. He was buried privately at St Clement Danes in the Strand, London, on 4 November.<br>
