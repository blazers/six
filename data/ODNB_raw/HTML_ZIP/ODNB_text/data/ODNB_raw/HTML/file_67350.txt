<span class="headword">Allchurch,  Ivor John</span>  (1929&#150;1997), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born on 16 October 1929 at 66 Waunwen Road, Swansea, the sixth of the seven children of Charles Wilfred (Charlie) Allchurch, furnaceman, and his wife, Mabel, formerly Miller, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. His parents were natives of Dudley who had moved to Swansea. He was educated at Plasmarl School, Swansea, but left at fourteen to work first in an office, then as a fish market porter.<br>
<br>Allchurch's extraordinary football talents, which in peacetime would have earned schoolboy representative honours, were spotted in September 1944 by a scout from Swansea Town. He became a member of the club's ground staff in 1945 and a full professional two years later. National service with the army from 1947 to 1949 delayed his entry into league football, although he played at a high non-league standard as a guest with Shrewsbury Town and Wellington Town. He made his Football League second-division d&eacute;but on 26 December 1949, away to West Ham United, and made an immediate impact as an elegant, ball-playing inside-forward. Roy Paul, a Swansea team-mate, recalled that &#145;Even as a youngster he had the hallmark of greatness&#146;  (Paul, 79). Within weeks of his d&eacute;but Allchurch was the subject of transfer speculation, and in less than a year he was a Welsh international, capped against Ireland at Sunderland on 15 November 1950.<br>
<br>Among the most gifted of a remarkable generation of footballers who emerged from Swansea in the decade following the Second World War, Allchurch was without question the one most cherished by his home town. In part this was because he was more closely identified with Swansea Town than the others. Jack Kelsey and John Charles spent their careers with other clubs, Trevor Ford played little more than a season, and Cliff Jones played five seasons with Swansea before passing the bulk of his career elsewhere. Allchurch's popularity also reflected his quality as a footballer. Tall, slim, and fair-haired&#151;characteristics that led to his being described as Swansea's &#145;Golden Boy&#146;  (Farmer and Stead, 12)&#151;he was described by the Scottish journalist Bob Ferrier as &#145;the complete natural intuitive inside-forward&#151;the Mozart of football&#146;  (ibid., 49). Jimmy Hill, who played against him, said &#145;he had elegance &hellip; the game never seemed to be going too fast for him&#146;  (ibid., 163). Jimmy Murphy, who managed the Wales national team in the late 1950s, said: &#145;Ivor had the lot. He was two-footed: a superb runner on the ball with a glorious body swerve. He could shoot hard and accurately with both feet, and he was very good in the air&#146;  (Murphy, 102).<br>
<br>On 13 June 1953 Allchurch married Esme Thomas, an eighteen-year-old accountant machine operator in a toy factory, and daughter of Richard Thomas, labourer in a steel works. They had two sons; three other children were stillborn. Allchurch continued to play for Swansea until 1958. Some observers argued that his decision to stay with second-division Swansea led to his not fulfilling a remarkable talent. Before the abolition of the maximum wage in 1961 there was no financial pressure on players to move to leading clubs. Allchurch was described by John Charles as &#145;a loyal Swansea lad. All he wanted to do was play football&#146;  (<span class="italic">South Wales Evening Post</span>, 11 July 1997). He was content to stay, hoping Swansea might win promotion. There were years of press speculation, much predicting that his transfer would set a new British record. In 1952 he nearly did leave, for Wolverhampton Wanderers, but as a consequence of the club's financial situation&#151;which was improved in time to negate the transfer&#151;rather than any desire on his part. Any suggestion of underachievement was belied by his international performances, particularly in the 1958 world cup, when Wales, after qualifying for the first time, reached the quarter-final before losing to the eventual winners, Brazil. Santiago Bernabeu, president of Real Madrid, then the dominant club in Europe, called him &#145;the greatest inside-forward in the world&#146;  (Murphy, 103).<br>
<br>In October 1958 Allchurch left Swansea for Newcastle United, saying &#145;it is now or never&#146;  (Farmer and Stead, 85). He stayed at Newcastle until 1962, then moved to Cardiff City before returning to Swansea Town in 1965. He played his 694th and last Football League match&#151;at the time the third-highest career total&#151;in May 1968. These included 103 first-division matches, all for Newcastle. He scored 245 goals, including 160 (a club record) for Swansea. The first man to play more than fifty times for Wales, his sixty-eight caps and twenty-three goals remained national records for many years following his last cap in 1966. He was appointed MBE in the new year's honours list of 1966.<br>
<br>Allchurch went on playing non-league football until the age of fifty, when his wife demanded that he burn his boots. He then worked as a storeman. He was mild-mannered and unpretentious, diffident to the point of shyness. In company he was &#145;modest, reserved, quietly elegant and circumspect&#146;, and in later life took on &#145;something of a clerical air&#146; with a &#145;refined manner and somewhat nervous smile&#146;  (Farmer and Stead, 164). He died at his home, 12 Whitestone Road, Bishopston, Swansea, on 9 July 1997, of cancer. He was survived by his wife and their two sons. His funeral, at Morriston crematorium, near Swansea, on 16 July 1997, attracted more than 500 mourners. His younger brother, Len (<i>b</i>. 1933), was also a successful footballer, who played for Swansea (in 1953&#150;4 the club's playing staff included four sets of brothers), Sheffield United, and Stockport. He won eleven Wales caps between 1955 and 1964.<br>
