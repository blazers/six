<span class="headword">Ashe,  Thomas</span>  (1836&#150;1889), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at Stockport, Cheshire, in June 1836. His father, John Ashe (<i>d</i>. 1879), originally a cotton spinner and a Manchester manufacturer, resolved late in life to take holy orders, was prepared for ordination by his own son, and became vicar of St Paul's at Crewe, Cheshire, in 1869. Ashe was educated at Stockport grammar school and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he entered as a sizar in 1855 and graduated BA with honours in mathematics as senior optime in 1859. At Cambridge he founded <span class="italic">The Eagle</span>, the St John's College magazine, and published his first collection of poetry in 1859. He was ordained deacon in that year and priest in 1860; at Easter 1860 he became curate of Silverstone, Northamptonshire. While at Silverstone he wrote a second collection of poetry, <span class="italic">Dryope and other Poems</span> (1861). In 1865 he resigned his curacy to teach mathematics at Leamington College, Warwickshire. Two years later he moved to a similar post at Queen Elizabeth's School, Ipswich, where he remained until 1879. During the 1860s he contributed articles on English poets to <span class="italic">Chambers's Book of Days</span> (1862&#150;4), but he chiefly devoted himself to his poetry, publishing <span class="italic">Pictures, and other Poems</span> (1865), the work for which he was best known. It sold well, running to three editions in five years, and <span class="italic">The Sorrows of Hypsipyle</span> (1867) furthered his growing reputation for &#145;his skill in laying hold of the rare beauties of classic fable and reclothing them in a refined and simple English dress&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 18 May 1867). <span class="italic">Songs now and then</span> appeared in 1876, when his work was most appreciated.<br>
<br>After two years in Paris Ashe finally, in 1881, settled in London, where he was engaged in editing Coleridge's works for the <span class="roman">Aldine Edition of the British Poets</span> series. He also edited three volumes of Coleridge's prose for Henry George Bohn's <span class="roman">Standard Library</span>: <span class="italic">Lectures and Notes on Shakespeare</span> (1883), <span class="italic">Table Talk and Omniana</span> (1884), and <span class="italic">Miscellanies, Aesthetic and Literary</span> (1885). In 1886 a complete edition of Ashe's poetry was published, but by this time his popularity had waned, to the extent that two years later his <span class="italic">Songs of a Year</span> (1888) had to be privately published. Reviewers of his poetry of the 1860s had paid tribute to his &#145;deep knowledge and sympathy with children&#146; demonstrated in his many &#145;fanciful love poems addressed to a child of thirteen or so&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 47). However, by the late 1880s attitudes had altered. As the sexual psychologist Havelock Ellis remarked in his introduction to a selection of Ashe's poetry, &#145;there is something not quite virile and wholesome, a certain touch of perversity in this absorbed brooding on child life&#146;  (Miles, 223). Ashe died at his home, 10 Worcester Street, St George's Square, Pimlico, London, on 18 December 1889 and was buried in St James's churchyard, Sutton, Macclesfield, Cheshire.<br>
