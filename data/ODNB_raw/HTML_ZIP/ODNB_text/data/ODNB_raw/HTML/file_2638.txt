<span class="headword">Blenkiron,  William</span>  (1807?&#150;1871), <span class="occ">racehorse breeder</span>, was born at Marrick, near Richmond, Yorkshire. His father was a Swaledale farmer but Blenkiron abandoned that pursuit and moved in 1834 to London, where he commenced business as a general agent in Wood Street, Cheapside. In 1845 he added a business manufacturing stocks and collars to his economic activities but three years later retired in favour of his son to devote his time to the breeding of racehorses.<br>
<br>In 1847, while living at Dalston, Middlesex, Blenkiron purchased a mare named Glance. A colt of hers, Young Beverlac, was raced with moderate success and was exchanged for three mares which formed the commencement of a stud destined to become the most celebrated in Europe. About 1852 Blenkiron, wishing to expand his breeding facilities, moved from Dalston to Middle Park Farm at Eltham in Kent. The establishment rapidly increased to more than two hundred of the highest-class mares and stallions that money and experience could produce. Kingston, Touchstone, Birdcatcher, and Newminster were the four cornerstones of Blenkiron's extensive stud, and it was to the first of these that he to a great extent owed his success as a breeder, for Kingston was the sire of Caractacus, perhaps the most sensational Derby winner on record.<br>
<br>Unlike many successful industrialists, Blenkiron did not abandon his business practices when he entered racing. He spent heavily but usually wisely. Among his purchases he gave 5000 guineas for Blink Bonny (one of only four fillies to have won both the Derby and the Oaks), 5800 guineas for Gladiateur (the first French horse to win the Derby), and 5000 guineas for Blair Athol (winner of the St Leger).<br>
<br>The first major sale of Middle Park bloodstock took place in June 1856, when thirteen lots brought &pound;1447, an average of &pound;111 each; at a sale in 1871, forty-six lots produced &pound;14,525, the average price being &pound;315. Middle Park was by then the largest breeding stud in the country. After 1866, the year in which Blenkiron purchased all Lord Zetland's brood mares, it became necessary to hold two annual sales to dispose of the increase in the stock.<br>
<br>Blenkiron bred Hermit, the Derby winner in 1867, and Gamos, which won the Oaks in 1870. This was unusual among the commercial studs as most classic winners still emanated from private breeders, to whom time and money were often no object. He died at Middle Park Farm on 25 September 1871, and was buried five days later in Eltham churchyard. His son sold the stud in 1872 for 124,620 guineas.<br>
