<span class="headword">Attwell,  Hugh</span>  (<em>c.</em>1597&#150;1621), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was possibly the son of George Attwell, who served as a clown and wrote jigs for Philip Henslowe and the Admiral's Men, one of the two leading adult companies, dying in 1598. Hugh Attwell, if he was George's son, must have been conceived not long before his father died, because he would have been aged ten or eleven when he began as a boy player, probably about 1608, in the Queen's Revels company at the Blackfriars and later the Whitefriars hall playhouses. He is noted in a copy of Jonson's folio edition of his plays in 1616 as taking the role of Sir Amorous La Foole in <span class="italic">Epicene</span>, first staged at the end of 1609, a fairly mature comic role. The fact that a note in the Jonson folio recorded his name and only one other suggests that he was the most memorable performer in that play. It was La Foole's lines about the prince of Moldavia that got the play banned in February 1610.<br>
<br>When the boy company was dissolved in 1610 or 1611, Attwell went into the new Lady Elizabeth's Men, a mixture of the ex-boy players and a few adult players from other groups, including his fellow boy star in <span class="italic">Epicene</span>, the writer William Barksted&#151;who played the leading gull Morose in that play against Attwell's gallant&#151;Joseph Taylor, and Nathan Field. The Lady Elizabeth's company merged with Prince Charles's Men in 1615. Nothing much is known about their repertoire of plays, nor what kinds of role Attwell might have played in them, although his role as Sir Amorous suggests that he was elegant and well-spoken, a view confirmed by his fellow player Will Rowley in his elegy written at Attwell's early death in 1621. The same elegy describes him as a &#145;little man&#146;  (Bentley, 2.352).<br>
<br>The merged company performed at the old Curtain playhouse, as the fourth and least reputable of the companies then trying to make a living in London. The Curtain did not please them. In January 1616 Attwell and six others signed a letter to Edward Alleyn asking for a better playhouse and a loan to keep them going. In 1617, however, their fortunes improved. They took the place of Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull, one of the two leading amphitheatres, controlled by Christopher Beeston, who was starting his great career as an impresario. In 1619 Beeston gave them a fresh impetus by transferring them to his hall playhouse, the Cockpit, already the chief rival to the King's Men's Blackfriars. They performed at least once at court, playing Thomas Middleton and Samuel Rowley's <span class="italic">A Fair Quarrell</span>, and Attwell performed with others from the company in a masque, Middleton's <span class="italic">Masque of Heroes</span>, for the Inner Temple at the beginning of 1619. Otherwise, the records of Attwell's activities as a player are few.<br>
<br>When he was in his early twenties, on 4 May 1618, Attwell married Mary Partridge, a widow, in Stepney. No child is recorded of his marriage, which happened half-way through the six-year struggle against the debilitating illness of which he died on 25 September 1621. His fellow actor, the clown and writer William Rowley, wrote a verse epitaph which asked:<blockquote>
<div>But did he not play fair? Held he not out<br>
</div>
<div>With courage beyond his bone? Full six years<br>
</div>
<div>To wrestle and tug with Death!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Rowley's celebration concluded &#145;His heart a Saint's, his tongue a silver bell&#146;, and described his voice as having:<blockquote>
<div>Mongst living Princes &hellip; sweetly sung,<br>
</div>
<div>(While they have sung his praise).<br>
</div> (Bentley, 2.352)</blockquote>
