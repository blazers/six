<span class="headword">Simson,  Alexander</span>  (1570&#150;1639), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25601/', "Andrew Simson (c.1526&#150;1591?)")</script>, minister of Dalkeith, and Violet, sister of Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews; among his six brothers and three sisters were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25605/', "Patrick Simson (1556&#150;1618)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25608/', "William Simson (b. 1562, d. in or after 1623)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25603/', "Archibald Simson (1564&#150;1628)")</script>. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, graduating MA in 1590. Alexander was appointed to &#145;teach&#146; at Muckhart in November 1591, and was on the exercise at Stirling in the same month. He became minister of Alva and Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, in the following year. On 9 June 1596 Alexander (along with his brother Patrick and the &#145;haill ministars and Reidars&#146; of the presbytery of Stirling) &#145;maid a new covenant with god&#146; by restating his adherence to the solemn oath contained in the confession of faith of 1581  (Stirling presbytery registers, CH2/722/3). He was admitted to the parish of Mertoun, in the presbytery of Earlston, Berwickshire, in 1597. Nothing is known of his life over the next two decades, except that at some date he married and had a son, Andrew. Following the imposition of episcopacy in 1610 he was probably advised by his brother Patrick not to court a high public profile.<br>
<br>A convinced presbyterian, Simson was one of a large number of ministers who gathered at Edinburgh in 1621 to organize opposition within parliament to the intended ratification of the five articles of Perth. In a sermon preached at the &#145;Grayfrier Kirk&#146; on 22 July, he found fault with the bishops and certain &#145;ministeris [of both England and Scotland], as not being cairfull watchemen and warneris of his majestie of his synis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 12.545), and for &#145;omitting to putt [the king] in mind of the breache of the covenant&#146; which the Perth articles represented  (Calderwood, 7.470). Such was the sensitivity of the issue that the minister was hauled before the privy council the next day. Simson promptly made matters worse by refusing to recognize the jurisdiction of the council over ecclesiastical affairs, and by denouncing John Spottiswoode, archbishop of St Andrews, and three other &#145;bishops that were present, [as] belligods, and enemies to the Kirk of Christ in this land&#146;  (ibid.). As a consequence of Simson's &#145;undeutifull speecheis&#146; all ministers except those of the burgh and &#145;such others as may have special warrant&#146; were ordered to quit Edinburgh, &#145;and not return while parliament is sitting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 12.546). Simson was imprisoned at the castle of Dumbarton, at his own expense, to await sentence. On 10 October he was released, and confined to his home parish of Mertoun.<br>
<br>According to the minister and contemporary church historian John Livingstone, Simson &#145;knew and cared little for earthly things, was unwearied in prayer, and constantly occupied with the <span class="roman">Bible</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasti Scot.</span>, 2.158). Certainly his piety impressed John Stewart, &#145;Captaine of Dumbartane&#146;, who &#145;beyond all expectation &hellip; wold take nothing for [the minister's] interteanement&#146; at the castle  (Calderwood, 7.511). Age and infirmity caused Simson to demit his ministry before May 1632, but he remained opposed to the bishops, and was the author of <span class="italic">The Destruction of Inbred Corruption, or, The Christians Warfare Against the Bosome Enemy</span> (London, 1644). He died on 17 July 1639 and was buried at Dryburgh, Berwickshire.<br>
