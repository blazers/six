<span class="headword">William II</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>William Rufus]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1060&#150;1100), <span class="occ">king of England</span>, was born about 1060, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29448/', "William I (the Conqueror), king of England and duke of Normandy (1027/8&#150;1087)")</script>, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18335/', "Matilda of Flanders (d. 1083)")</script>. His elder brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23715/', "Robert Curthose, later duke of Normandy (d. 1134)")</script>, and Richard, who died before 1074. He had at least one younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12948/', "Henry (d. 1135)")</script>, his successor as king, and five sisters: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/164/', "Adelida")</script>, Cecilia, abbess of Caen, Matilda, Constance, countess of Brittany, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/161/', "Adela, countess of Blois")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandyouth"></a>Background and youth</h2>On his father's side William Rufus was originally of viking, latterly of Norman, stock. His mother's father, Baudouin (V), count of Flanders (<i>d</i>. 1067), had married Adela, daughter of Robert II, the Capetian king of France. Hence the young William was related to most of the high aristocracy of northern France and the Rhineland. Bynames like Rufus, which refer primarily to the colour of the hair but also to the complexion, were in common use. William of Malmesbury, writing about twenty years after William II's death, claimed that he had a rufous complexion and yellow hair. Guibert, abbot of Nogent, writing about the same time, said that he was called <i>Rufus</i> because he was one. And, later, Orderic Vitalis used the nickname throughout his ecclesiastical history. Although it would seem unlikely that William was in fact called &#145;Le Ros&#146; or &#145;Le Rossel&#146; (the vernacular equivalents of Rufus) in his own lifetime, the epithet Rufus serves to distinguish him from all the other Williams of the period. Despite his mother's being very short, apparently little over 4 feet tall, and the pope's condemnation in 1049 of her proposed marriage as incestuous, her children were, although probably small, in general healthy and vigorous. All four sons were adventurers and active hunters and soldiers. And even if Rufus was less intelligent than his brothers, he was endowed with steadiness, common sense, and some wit.<br>
<br>By the time of William Rufus's birth his father had overcome most of the difficulties he had faced after inheriting as a bastard child a turbulent duchy, and was about to start on a series of conquests. In 1063 he acquired the county of Maine and in 1066 England. Rufus, as the third son, could, perhaps, have expected an appanage. But there was a tradition that for his education he was put in the household of the scholar and monk Lanfranc, presumably in 1065&#150;6 when Lanfranc was abbot of Caen. If, however, his parents had intended him for the church, the death of their second son, Richard, some time between 1069 and 1074 (and also Rufus's obvious unsuitability for a clerical career) brought him back to the Conqueror's side to serve as a knight bachelor. An intimate acquaintance with the monastic life at an impressionable age could, however, have inspired in him the ribaldry and contempt for the church he was to display when king. All observers agreed that Rufus was a good and dutiful son. But it was easier for him than for the heir, Robert, to accept dependence on their father.<br>
<br>Robert was recognized by the duke and the duke's overlord, the king of France, both before and after 1066, as titular duke of Normandy and count of Maine, but increasingly resented his lack of independence and his poverty. Orderic Vitalis tells a story which explains why Robert first ran away and also throws light on how the brothers got on together. Probably in 1078, when Robert would have been about twenty-five, Rufus eighteen, and Henry ten, they were with their father at L'Aigle, on the south-east frontier of Normandy, when he was about to attack one of his neighbours. The two younger sons were lodging with the king in the house of the merchant Gunher, while Robert, who had his own household, was quartered on another burgess. Rufus and Henry paid Robert a visit, went upstairs, began to play dice, &#145;as soldiers do&#146;, made a great commotion and then urinated on the heads of Robert and his friends. Robert dashed upstairs to punish his juniors, and the brawl was so fierce that it brought the king onto the scene. He restored order and forced them to make friends. But Robert had lost face, and the following night he and his companions decamped and made for Rouen, probably about one day's forced march away, where they tried to seize the keep. When they failed and the king ordered their arrest, they fled from Normandy. In the following year both Rufus and his father were wounded when they attempted to expel Robert from the fortified town of Gerberoi, where he was living as a robber baron, and, since the father's wound was inflicted by Robert himself, this incident probably determined Rufus's future.<br>
<br>In 1080 Robert made his peace with the king and he and Rufus went with him to England, where Malcolm III Canmore, king of Scots, who was attacking the northern shires, had to be contained and south Wales had to be overawed. Rufus could have taken part in Robert's invasion of Lothian in that year and the king's march to St David's in the next. Then they returned to the duchy to deal with Foulques of Anjou's invasion of Maine, and Rufus was presumably in the ducal army which invaded Anjou and secured the peace of Blanchland which confirmed Robert's tenure of Maine. Rufus was with his father in both Normandy and England in 1082 at the time when the Conqueror had his half-brother, Odo, bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent, arrested and thrown into prison for reasons which are by no means clear. In 1083 Robert left Normandy again to make his fortune in the wide world; and he made no attempt to return before the king's death. Rufus's attendance on his father is noticed only occasionally between 1084 and 1087; but there is nothing to suggest that they were ever separated for long.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1087 the Conqueror suffered an injury while attacking Mantes, a town in the French Vexin, and lay on his deathbed in a suburb of Rouen for five weeks. His testamentary arrangements were variously reported and have been endlessly discussed. It would seem that his original intention was to disinherit Robert Curthose entirely in favour of Rufus, but that he was dissuaded by the Norman magnates who had done homage to Robert and bore him no ill will. Nevertheless, the Conqueror was determined that Rufus should have some substantial reward for his loyalty. Almost at the end, on 7 or 8 September, he sent him to England with a letter addressed to Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, possibly the royal regalia, and some of the English hostages: probably Harold's brother Wulfnoth (who may have languished in Norman captivity since 1051) and Morcar, the former earl of Northumbria. Rufus, with a small retinue, sailed probably from Touques to the Hampshire or Sussex coast, made for Winchester to secure the royal treasure, and within a fortnight, on 26 September, was crowned king of England by Lanfranc in Westminster Abbey. It was a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, legitimatized by unction and investiture and made possible only by Rufus's audacity and Lanfranc's decisive action in deference to the Conqueror's wishes.<h2>
<a name="Thekingdomacquired10871089"></a>The kingdom acquired, 1087&#150;1089</h2>William was about twenty-seven years old at his accession, a seasoned soldier and commander but with only a limited knowledge of England, and, although well acquainted with his father's ways, without experience of government. But, backed by Lanfranc, he secured without difficulty the submission of the royal administration, the sheriffs and ministerial nobility; and any opposition there might have been among the baronage was stifled by the absence of most of the greatest nobility in Normandy and ignorance of Robert's whereabouts and intentions. It remained to be seen, however, whether Rufus could withstand the inevitable reaction of the &#145;true heir&#146; and his supporters. Robert had returned as soon as he heard that his father was dead, and was accepted by the baronage and church as duke of Normandy and count of Maine. He was naturally angry at the presumption of his junior, probably all the more since, on the several occasions on which he had been recognized as his father's heir, William would have done him homage. But, in many ways a foolish man, he seems to have imagined that the Anglo-Norman baronage would simply expel the &#145;usurper&#146;. Rufus, however, was taking root. He had distributed the Conqueror's treasure among the churches and counties and recruited the clever bishop of Durham, William of St Calais, as his adviser. Within a few months he had gained the support of much of the English church and baronage. His main imprudence&#151;and it was one he could hardly have avoided&#151;was to allow at Christmas 1087 his half-uncle, Odo, bishop of Bayeux (who had been close to Robert and had been imprisoned by the Conqueror), to recover all his English fiefs and the earldom of Kent. Odo, a powerful man through his blood ties to king and duke and his patronage of other prelates and barons, had at that point done no wrong to Rufus. Once he had secured his own position, however, he began to organize a rebellion against the king. His main supporters were his brother, Robert, count of Mortain, Roger de Montgomery, earl of Shrewsbury, and Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, all large landholders in England. They resented the inconvenience of having to serve two masters and preferred the feckless Robert to Rufus, whom they regarded as even more authoritarian than his father. It was a rebellion of high-ranking Normans against an Anglo-Norman establishment supported by insular society as a whole.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1088 the conspirators fortified their castles, primarily Rochester, Tonbridge, and Pevensey, attacked royal estates, and awaited Robert's invasion. There were also minor satellite revolts in East Anglia and the Welsh marches; and the duke sent Eustace (III), count of Boulogne, and three sons of Roger de Montgomery with some knights to Odo as an advance party. But the king, based in London, mobilized all the forces he could and, losing no time, knocked out Tonbridge, invested Rochester, forced Pevensey to surrender, and in July took Rochester and, with it, most of the rebel leaders. This victory caused the collapse of all the peripheral rebellions. Rufus's treatment of the rebels was shrewd. While disinheriting and banishing Odo, he was selectively magnanimous with the rest. Among the exceptions was his younger brother, Henry, who had stayed with Robert but took this opportunity to cross to England and ask William for their mother's lands which, he claimed, she had bequeathed him. He returned to Normandy empty-handed. And the king had one other score to settle. William of St Calais had deserted from the royal army and fled to his cathedral city of Durham in March. On 2 November he appeared under a safe conduct at the royal court, meeting at (Old) Salisbury, to answer a charge of treason. A vivid eye-witness account of the trial, a <i>libellus</i> probably composed by one of the bishop's clerks for use at the papal curia, has survived. The king, supported by Archbishop Lanfranc and most of his court, demanded that the accused should stand trial under feudal law as a baron. But the bishop refused: he must be tried as a bishop under ecclesiastical law and only by his episcopal peers. Neither side would give way. After much wrangling the exasperated king exclaimed (in French, but reported in Latin),<blockquote>By the face of Lucca, you'll never escape from my hands before I have your castle. Believe me, bishop, you're not going back to Durham, and your men are not going to stay at Durham, and you're not going free until you release the castle. (Barlow, <span class="italic">William Rufus</span>, 89)</blockquote>And in the end the bishop did surrender Durham and was allowed to cross to Normandy, where for two years he acted as Robert's chief adviser. Rufus's victory over the rebels allowed him to reward his friends and supporters, such as Robert fitz Haimon (honour of Gloucester), Henry de Beaumont (earldom of Warwick), Simon (I) de Senlis (earldoms of Huntingdon and of Northampton), and Walter Giffard (earldom of Buckingham). When Archbishop Lanfranc died on 28 May 1089 the restraints on the king were even more reduced.<h2>
<a name="Appearanceandcharacter"></a>Appearance and character</h2>The most elaborate portrait of the new ruler is given by William of Malmesbury. Although not firsthand, it seems likely enough. A short man, thickset and muscular, with a protruding belly, he was a dandy dressed always in the height of fashion, however outrageous. The short tunics and the shoes with long points which curled like scorpions' tails aroused most criticism. He wore his blond hair long, parted in the centre so as to leave his forehead (shamelessly) bare; and in his red choleric face were lively eyes of changeable colour, speckled with flecks of light. He was at ease with his cronies in private and cracked jokes as he dealt with the business of the day; and he was never so facetious as when he was doing wrong, for he hoped that the jest would dispel the stigma. In public, however, his lack of eloquence was noticeable, and when angry he was reduced to stuttering incoherence. He was apt to assume a ferocious manner, and with his haughty inflamed face, threatening eyes, and loud hectoring voice sought to intimidate the company. Yet, if the Malmesbury monk's picture of a boorish figure, foppishly dressed, and puffed up with an exaggerated sense of his rank and dignity, would seem to make him a rather ridiculous figure, there is no evidence that men thought him so. Those who approached him must have been aware of a cautionary menace. Anselm, his second archbishop of Canterbury, thought of him as a wild bull.<br>
<br>Moreover, although he easily took offence and paid back any imagined insult with interest, like most good soldiers Rufus appreciated boldness in others and was easily pacified. He was also generous, indeed often shamelessly extravagant, by conspicuous consumption proclaiming his aristocratic insouciance. To a servant who bought him a pair of shoes for a shilling, he shouted, &#145;You son of a whore! Since when has a king got to wear shoes as cheap as that! Go and buy me some for a mark of silver [13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.]&#146;  (<span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 313). He was famous for his bravery and chivalry, what William of Malmesbury calls magnanimity. And the monk gives an example. In March 1091, when Rufus and Robert were besieging their brother Henry in Mont-St Michel, the king saw from his tent some enemy knights riding insolently past in the distance. Unable to restrain his valour, he immediately mounted a most expensive horse he had bought that very day and dashed off on his own to attack them. But he was over-confident; his horse was brought down, and, with a foot caught in a stirrup, he was dragged along the ground, saved from serious injury only by his armour. His assailant was about to strike him with his sword when Rufus, realizing his danger, called out, &#145;Stop, you fool! I'm the king of England!&#146; At this, Henry's men picked him up, brought him another mount, and Rufus, without waiting for further assistance, vaulted into the saddle. Then, running his eyes over the group of soldiers, he asked who had unhorsed him. The one responsible called out, &#145;It was me. But I didn't know you were the king. I thought you were only a knight.&#146; This greatly amused Rufus, and with sudden affability he replied,&#145;By the face of Lucca, from now on you'll be my man and in my service get a proper reward for your courage and spirit.&#146; The Malmesbury monk was reminded of Alexander the Great and the Persian soldier  (<span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 309). Yet Rufus, although fighting against the odds, had been beaten. And his military record as a whole does not seem to be quite tip-top. Unlike his father and brothers he fought no pitched battle and seldom a completely decisive campaign. Nevertheless, he was a lucky commander, and, as he boasted in 1099, his men would follow him even through raging seas. He was specially generous to soldiers and always ransomed his knights when captured. By never suffering a really serious defeat he earned the reputation of a victorious king.<br>
<br>Monastic writers, although acknowledging some of William's virtues, looked askance at his morals. By associating him with what they considered effeminate fashions in dress and comportment they hinted at his homosexuality. And since he never married and is not known to have had any bastards this has been generally accepted. On the other hand, no lovers or &#145;favourites&#146; can be identified; most of his close associates were heterosexual; and he would appear to have considered marrying Edith of Scots in 1093. It may be that he was bi-sexual, an indiscriminate lecher. Rufus has also been judged not only irreligious but also atheistical, even heretical. Certainly he shared the soldier's disrespect for Christian morality and the clerical life. He took no part in the first crusade. Stories, although almost certainly apocryphal, about his interest in Judaism were in circulation. He was thought to have ridiculed the fairness of trials by ordeal. According to Anselm's biographer, Eadmer, when fifty Englishmen, accused of crimes against the forest laws, were all found innocent by the ordeal of hot iron, the king was reported to have exclaimed,<blockquote>What's this? God's a just judge? Damn him I say who believes that after this! I swear by &#151; and &#151; [Eadmer suppresses the words] that from now on matters that can be bent by any man's nod shall be brought before my court, not God's. (<span class="italic">Historia novorum</span>, 102)</blockquote>Rufus's habitual oaths, &#145;By the (holy) face of Lucca&#146; and &#145;By the mountains and valleys&#146;, were considered remarkable and are indeed curious. But even if the latter is a <i>double entendre</i>, the former appears harmless. Perhaps the invocation of the sacred image at Lucca by such a man was considered blasphemous. But in this area the most serious charges do not seem to stick. He clearly retained to the end of his short life the louche habits he had acquired as a knight bachelor in his father's military household. He was ever a coarse soldier, a boon companion. But he was quite generous to monasteries, and, when he thought he was dying in 1093, he made abject submission to the church. It would seem likely that had he survived beyond the age of forty he would have conformed. Piety was for old age. In his last years he was sometimes the military companion of Guillaume, count of Poitou (VII) and duke of Aquitaine (IX), one of the earliest troubadours and a poet of distinction. They may have had something in common beyond a love of fighting. Rufus was a patron of at least one of the arts. In London he finished his father's White Tower and considerably improved the fortress. At Westminster likewise his Great Hall still stands and impresses. He was not just a buffoon.<h2>
<a name="TheNormanempiredivided10881096"></a>The Norman &#145;empire&#146; divided, 1088&#150;1096</h2>The relations between the three surviving sons of the Conqueror had always been uneasy. After Robert Curthose's failure to unseat Rufus in 1087&#150;8 he could expect, and received, a backlash, while Henry flitted between the two, relentlessly playing for his own hand. Henry, a clever, rather unpleasant, prince, was determined first to get an appanage and then to inherit the territories of one or both of his elders. He had respect and a preference for William but was aware that Robert was the weaker and the easier to exploit. Both William and Henry used their wealth against the extravagant and improvident Robert. In 1087&#150;8 Henry bought with &pound;3000 of his father's bequest the Avranchin and Cotentin and assumed the title of count. Rufus used his English revenues to seduce Robert's vassals and prepare for military intervention once the time was ripe. The Norman barons and church soon realized that Rufus was the stronger and richer ruler and had to decide whether tyranny was preferable to anarchy. The church in general was never in doubt and always regarded Rufus as a deliverer from misrule. The barons had mixed feelings and mostly preferred to wait on events.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1090 Rufus had secured the allegiance of perhaps the greater part of Upper Normandy, the old heartlands, centred on Eu, while Henry was aiming at making his appanage an independent county. The duchy was falling apart; and in October Rufus's friends instigated a revolt in Rouen, the capital city. But Henry's adherence to Robert and his personal intervention in the fighting at Rouen in November undoubtedly saved the duke. Rufus himself took no active part until February 1091, when he crossed the channel and set up his headquarters at Eu. There was, however, little fighting; William of St Calais, bishop of Durham, did the king a service, was reconciled to him, and seems to have negotiated the treaty &#145;of Rouen&#146; between the king and the duke. Robert was to grant to his brother the county of Eu, the abbey of F&eacute;camp, and the town of Cherbourg, both useful entry ports, and leave in his lordship all those Norman barons who had gone over to him. He must also have agreed to expel Edgar &AElig;theling, Edward the Confessor's great-nephew, for he is next noticed in Scotland, where his sister, Margaret, was queen. In return, apart from the cash which must have changed hands, the king was to help Robert to recover all other territory he had lost, give him some estates in England, and reinstate there all those who had been disinherited on account of their support of the duke. Moreover, each of the contracting parties was to become the other's heir. A subtext is the immediate and permanent disinheritance of Henry, who had displeased both his seniors. Accordingly, Robert and Rufus invaded the Cotentin and besieged Mont-St Michel, where Henry had taken refuge. In the end, after Rufus had earned some renown for his magnanimity and Robert some contempt for his lack of purpose, they allowed Henry to march out with his men and baggage. The cadet became a wanderer in France until, in 1092, he acquired the fortified town of Domfront in the southern marches of Normandy, at the expense of Robert de Bell&ecirc;me, one of the greatest of the border princes.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the king tried to bolster Robert's authority in the duchy. In June 1091 the archbishop of Rouen held a provincial synod in the city, presumably to further the pacification of Normandy, and on 18 July duke and king held an inquest at Caen into the judicial rights which the Conqueror had possessed. Immediately afterwards they left together for England because Malcolm III Canmore, king of Scots, had invaded in May and there was also trouble in Wales. The condominium of the &#145;two heirs of the Conqueror&#146; was still working. They made a show of strength against the Welsh and then Rufus mobilized an army and fleet to invade Scotland by the east coast route. On the march north, on 11 September, the bishop of Durham re-entered his city. And when the king and duke, having crossed the Tweed, made contact with Malcolm's army, intermediaries, Robert for Rufus and Edgar for Malcolm, arranged terms. It was agreed that the relationship between the two kings should be exactly as it had been in the Conqueror's time. Malcolm, therefore, did homage and fealty to Rufus, but not unconditionally, although the reservations were not spelt out. And, in return, Rufus restored to him the English lands and pension he had enjoyed before 1087. Edgar &AElig;theling was reconciled with William; and he and Duncan, Malcolm's eldest son, decided to accompany the English king south. Two days before Christmas 1091 Robert and Edgar sailed from the Isle of Wight to Normandy. There had been a quarrel between the brothers. The king may have been evasive about granting English lands to Robert and clearly he had no desire to return immediately to Normandy to help his brother against his enemies. Rufus did not revisit Normandy until 1094, Robert England before 1101. In the meantime, in May 1092, the king invaded north Britain by the west coast route, expelled Dolfin, who was ruling Cumbria, at least nominally under Malcolm, and refounded Carlisle as an English borough. He was restoring the historical frontier with Scotland, and, after Malcolm's death in 1093, there began an English advance, confirmed by feudal lordships and agricultural settlements, towards the Liddel and Tweed.<br>
<br>This resurgence of the English kingdom under William, however, almost came to a premature end in March 1093 when the king fell seriously ill of an unstated disease in the Welsh marches and lay incapacitated at Gloucester for the whole of Lent. Everyone, including the patient, believed that God was punishing him for his sins, and Rufus made a full confession to Anselm, abbot of Bec, who happened to be at hand, and promised to mend his life and carry out a series of reforms in the kingdom. More immediately, he ordered all his prisoners to be released and all his debts forgiven. He gave the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury to Anselm and made gifts to monasteries. The problem of who would have succeeded him had he died is not mentioned by the chroniclers. But no one would have been happy with the advent of either Robert or Henry. And it may well be that among Rufus's undertakings to Anselm, who was much concerned with his moral welfare, was a promise to take a wife. This can be associated with his unsuccessful diplomatic exchanges with Malcolm in the summer. When the king of Scots pressed him to carry out the terms of their treaty, Rufus summoned him to Gloucester, and sent him hostages and then Edgar &AElig;theling to conduct him south. But in August he refused to receive the visitor, who, naturally, returned to Scotland in a fury. Meanwhile, it seems, Rufus had called in at Wilton Abbey. Among the nuns there was, or had been, Gunnhild, the late King Harold's daughter, who got scandalously involved with the Breton counts of Richmond; and among those being educated there were Edith (or Matilda) and Mary, the two daughters of Malcolm and Margaret. Matilda, a girl of twelve and a niece of Edgar, would have been a most suitable match for Rufus. However, the abbess, apparently to save the girl from such a fate, disguised her as a nun. And when Rufus entered the cloister, &#145;as though he wanted to look at the roses and the other flowering shrubs&#146;  (quoted in Barlow, <span class="italic">William Rufus</span>, 312), and found Matilda veiled, he abruptly left the church. A week later her father arrived at Wilton, ripped off her veil, stamped it under foot, and took her away. In the autumn the humiliated Malcolm invaded England for the fifth time, only to be ambushed and killed on 13 November by the earl of Northumbria, Robert de Mowbray. Rufus had evaded the bonds of matrimony and Matilda was left to marry his brother, King Henry I, hardly a more satisfactory husband, in 1100. As for Scotland, it became Rufus's policy to support Malcolm's sons, first Duncan and then, more successfully, Matilda's brother, Edgar, in defiance of a Gaelic reaction against this Anglicized family.<br>
<br>Although Rufus remained in diplomatic touch with Robert after their quarrel, he made no great effort to heal it. He managed to keep lordship over Guillaume, count of Eu, and in 1093 reactivated an alliance with the count of Flanders. At Christmas 1093 Robert notified Rufus that unless he carried out the terms of the treaty of Rouen, or justified the delay, he would repudiate it. Rufus attended on 11 February the consecration of Battle Abbey, his father's penitential foundation, by Archbishop Anselm. He then crossed the channel on 19 March 1094 and, after a fruitless meeting with his brother and a declaration by the guarantors of the treaty that he was to blame, he too denounced the agreement. But, although Robert secured the active support of his overlord, King Philippe I of France, and Rufus summoned Henry from Domfront to his aid and himself raided from Eu, a military solution was always unlikely.<br>
<br>In January 1095 the king, having achieved little at enormous cost, returned to England. Indeed, his fortunes had reached their lowest ebb: during his absence there had been a general revolt of the Welsh against their Norman lords; he was having trouble with Anselm, his archbishop of Canterbury; and he discovered a baronial conspiracy against him led by Robert de Mowbray, earl of Northumberland. It was thought that the conspirators intended to replace him not by Robert Curthose but by his cousin, Stephen of Aumale, the son of one of the plotters, Odo of Champagne. In the summer the king led an army north. Pushing on from Durham he forced the surrender of the new castle on the Tyne and set siege to the great coastal fortress of Bamburgh. From there, on hearing that the Welsh had captured Montgomery, he went immediately to the aid of Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury. An army was raised and several columns were dispatched to rendezvous in Snowdonia early in November. But the Welsh did not give battle. The baronial rebellion also collapsed. When Robert de Mowbray escaped from Bamburgh and took refuge in the monastery at Tynemouth, he was dragged out, imprisoned at Windsor, and in January 1096 tried with some others of the conspirators for treason at (Old) Salisbury. The earl was kept in prison until he died many years later. Guillaume, count of Eu, defeated in the trial by battle, was blinded and castrated, mutilations which he did not survive. The count's steward was hanged. Some others suffered mutilation, heavy fines, or banishment. In 1096 Rufus was not as merciful as in 1088.<br>
<br>On 27 November 1095, while the king was finishing his campaign in Northumberland, Pope Urban II preached the sermon at Clermont in the Auvergne which inspired the expedition against the Saracens, known later as the first crusade. In February 1096 Robert Curthose took the cross, and a papal legate negotiated a settlement between the brothers. It was arranged that Rufus should pay Robert 10,000 marks of silver in return for the custody and revenues of the duchy for three years. This sum, less than a quarter of Rufus's ordinary annual revenue from England, can be considered a shrewd investment. And, as part of the settlement, the king granted Henry the counties of Coutances and Bayeux, except for the city of Bayeux and the town of Caen, an appanage somewhat larger than he had obtained from Robert. In September Robert abandoned his turbulent duchy and his troublesome brothers with relief. It was probably generally accepted that it was unlikely that he would ever return.<h2>
<a name="Theroyalgovernment"></a>The royal government</h2>Although William Rufus had no mind but to walk in the ways of his father, his unavoidable almost continuous presence in England until 1096 was a novelty which increased the pressure of royal government on the baronage, the sheriffs, and the church, while the preparations he made to break out of his confinement intensified the burden. He recruited knights for his military household; his progresses round the country were likened by the sufferers to the ravages of an invading army; and his wars and subsidies to allies had to be paid for by his subjects, especially the church. William was not a creative governor or lawgiver. He maintained the traditional powers of the English monarch, newly reinforced by the conquest and the bonds of homage and fealty, and thereby consolidated many of his father's improvisations. And he maintained control over the new feudal society in the kingdom, often regulating the succession to the honours, and, through the judgments of his court, helped to mould the emerging body of Anglo-Norman feudal law. He pushed his own rights hard and in some unpopular directions. His enlargement of the royal hunting preserves (the forest, especially the New Forest) and his tightening of the severity of the laws to protect them were generally resented. Nevertheless, since he was a generous lord and a successful military commander, increasingly committed to the reunification of the Norman &#145;empire&#146;, a policy popular with the baronage, church, and mercantile class, he faced little overt opposition.<br>
<br>Such a pleasure-loving king needed loyal and able servants. And Rufus acquired them. His close vassals and military friends, a rather miscellaneous group of the highest Norman and Anglo-Norman aristocracy and &#145;new&#146; men, were qualified to advise him on military and estate-management matters, on diplomacy, and on feudal law. One of them, Urse d'Abetot, a royal constable, played a part in the financial administration. Another, Robert fitz Haimon, a close friend, the son of a sheriff of Kent, himself the son of the lord of Torigni in Normandy, served him in many out-of-court capacities. Bishops, literate and educated in the classics, had their part to play at this exalted level; and the king, despite his anti-clerical reputation, was ably served by some of his most respectable prelates, including Lanfranc of Canterbury, William of St Calais of Durham, Gundulf of Rochester, Wulfstan of Worcester, and, in the later years, Walkelin of Winchester. For the more detailed administration he took over some members of his father's clerical household; and one of these, the chaplain Ranulf Flambard, a very remarkable man, handsome, athletic, and a good talker (but certainly no homosexual), served him devotedly throughout the reign. He became the king's completely trusted factotum, a precursor of the later chief justiciars, and was rewarded in the end with the bishopric of Durham. The royal government in the shires, including collection of the king's revenues, depended on the sheriffs, his omnicompetent executive officers. Once again Rufus rewarded loyalty and made only such changes as were forced on him. In at least ten cases he took over his father's men and most of these either retained the office for the whole of the reign or passed it to their heir. The king's government was directed to two basic purposes: to keep good order by exterminating criminals and settling disputes by law and to collect the royal revenues: rents from the demesne, the land tax (danegeld) levied on most agricultural land, the profits of justice, the profits of tenure (&#145;feudal incidents&#146;), and miscellaneous sales and profits. The recently completed survey of the kingdom, known as <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>, which was kept in the royal treasury at Winchester, was of some help with the collection of the first two of these. William's servants, driven by their master, were hard and efficient exactors. Rufus became a rich king and a great spender. There was hardly another ruler in western Europe who could have, like him, raised at a few months' notice in 1096 the 7000 pounds of silver in cash (10,000 marks) he lent his brother on the security of the duchy. The baronage and the church, however, became aggrieved. And when Henry I succeeded to the throne he thought it advisable in his coronation charter to renounce his brother's &#145;unjust exactions&#146; and all &#145;bad customs&#146;.<br>
<br>The pleasure that Rufus took in the royal title and dignity is not surprising since by birth he was only the younger son of a count. And not only the Conqueror's children but also the Norman baronage had benefited from his promotion to duke and king. The new English nobility which Rufus inherited was largely a selection his father had made from the Norman aristocracy, itself of no great antiquity. But these men, whom Orderic Vitalis thought the Conqueror had raised almost from the dust, had quickly taken root in the kingdom and, moreover, had obtained formal registration, for they and their valuable estates had been listed in <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. This record did not create an untouchable caste, but it did help towards stability. Rufus was completely at home in this society. His accession to the throne and even two rebellions caused only the minimal changes necessary. He dispossessed some of the most culpable magnates, like Eustace, count of Boulogne, Odo of Bayeux, and Robert de Mowbray, and left the earldom of Hereford vacant; but in compensation he created new earls mostly from the oldest Norman families, and rewarded some of his friends, including a few of his favourite household knights, such as Roger de Nonant and Simon (I) de Senlis. In the middle and lower ranks of the baronage there seems to have been even less movement. But if the picture is one of general biological continuity, the baronage had to pay for it. Through royal generosity they had obtained large estates and sometimes titles. The king required in return military and other services and payments on certain occasions. By 1100 the baronage was of the opinion that Rufus had taken too much. According to Henry's coronation charter, on the death of a baron, earl, or other royal tenant he had forced the heir, instead of paying a just and legitimate &#145;relief&#146;, to repurchase the land. Moreover, to redress Rufus's other oppressions, Henry would not require a payment from a baron for permission to give his daughter, sister, or niece in marriage; he would only give an heiress in marriage on the advice of the barons; and he would not force a baron's widow to remarry. On the death of a baron who had left under-age children, custody of the land and children would in future go to the widow or some other close relation (that is, not to the king). Henry also gave permission for a baron, or, if prevented, his closest family, to bequeath his money and chattels for the salvation of his soul. But that Henry reintroduced all Rufus's &#145;malpractices&#146; as soon as he was strong enough, proves that his brother had not been outrageously severe. He had probably simply continued his father's practices.<br>
<br>Rufus probably milked the church even more effectively than the baronage. He believed, like his father, that he had considerable rights, largely proprietorial, in it (the &#145;ancestral customs&#146;). Accordingly, he exploited the bishoprics and royal abbeys in two ways: he sold them (simony), but with the price disguised as a gift or aid, and only to the usually satisfactory candidate he had chosen; and he kept the abbeys, rather than the bishoprics, vacant, often for long periods, in order to take their revenues. In 1100 ecclesiastical custodies were yielding more than danegeld. Church reformers regarded all this as iniquitous. But since some bishops of good repute served the king or frequented his court, it would seem that they accepted, although with some misgivings, that he was no lawless tyrant. His greatest difficulties were caused by one of his few mistakes: his appointment in 1093 of Anselm, abbot of Bec, as archbishop of Canterbury. For this act of contrition he did penance for four years. The pious monk, who sincerely resisted the promotion, deplored both the king's morals and his treatment of the church. Except for a few months in 1095, the two were always at loggerheads. They quarrelled immediately over the &#145;aid&#146; the king required from the incoming archbishop. In February 1094, while the king waited impatiently at Hastings for a favourable wind to carry him to Normandy, Anselm raised a series of tiresome matters culminating in his request to hold a general council of the English church in order, particularly, to attack the crimes of sodomy and incest which had become so prevalent in the kingdom, and, when refused permission, he turned to the matter of the vacant abbeys and the king's failure to appoint suitable heads. By this time Rufus was furious. &#145;What business is it of yours? Aren't they my abbeys? You do what you like with your manors. Why can't I do what I want with my abbeys?&#146; The archbishop rejoined that really the abbeys belonged to God and were not intended to finance the king's wars. And the king finished by declaring that he found Anselm's words most objectionable. &#145;Your predecessor [Lanfranc] would never have dared speak in this way to my father; and I will do nothing at all for you&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia novorum</span>, 49&#150;50). An even more difficult matter was that of Anselm's pallium, because each side had a lawful case. The pallium was the gift of the pope, and Anselm as abbot of Bec had recognized Urban II as pope. But Rufus had not found it necessary hitherto to decide between Urban and the imperial anti-pope, and claimed that by English royal custom he had the right of choice. When no solution to the impasse could be found at the royal council held at Rockingham in February 1095, Rufus decided to accept Urban in the hope that in return he would depose Anselm. Instead, the archbishop, urged by the diplomatic pope, more or less accepted the &#145;ancestral customs&#146; and for a time co-operated with the king. In 1097, however, Rufus complained about the archbishop's unsatisfactory military service against the Welsh, and Anselm, realizing that his situation was untenable, in November went into exile and spent the rest of the reign either with the pope or with the archbishop of Lyons. Rufus escaped papal censure partly through Anselm's magnanimity, partly because Urban needed his support. And the pope could see that Anselm could be difficult and that Rufus's rule of the English and Norman churches was tolerable. When he did appoint to bishoprics and abbeys he usually chose suitable men, rather better on the whole than his father's selection. Except on one occasion, he may not have looked for holiness, but he had a good eye for talent.<h2>
<a name="Theconsolidationoftheempire10961100"></a>The consolidation of the empire, 1096&#150;1100</h2>After the acquisition of the duchy Rufus spent more than half his time on the continent. On the second of his three visits in those four years he stayed for seventeen consecutive months. It is possible that after nine years' exile in England he was glad to be back. He certainly found plenty to do. Although he never took the title of duke, this was probably less because he was only a mortgagee than because, like his father, he believed that he was everywhere a king. And, probably like his father, he never did homage to the king of France. The Norman baronage and church seem to have accepted him without question: he represented the dynasty. As a soldier&#150;king he regarded the restoration of the boundaries as set by the Conqueror as his first priority. His father had been mortally injured when attacking the French Vexin in the valley of the Seine, territory disputed with the king of France; and Rufus directed most of his military efforts to the recovery of the three great strongholds there of Chaumont, Pontoise, and Mantes. But the local nobility, led by the French heir, Louis (later Louis VI), who held the territory as an appanage, successfully withstood his invasions in 1097&#150;8 and 1098&#150;9, although Rufus had the support of his brother Henry and of a number of famous soldiers, including Robert de Bell&ecirc;me. In 1099 Rufus was even joined by his namesake Guillaume, count of Poitou and duke of Aquitaine, who may have been attracted by his growing reputation as a generous hero. Although Rufus was no military genius, on balance he was a successful general at a time when the defence held a great advantage over the attack and campaigning was to some extent a pastime, an end in itself. However that may be, his one important achievement in this theatre of war was the foundation of a castle at Gisors on the Epte, designed by Robert de Bell&ecirc;me, which was to remain one of the principal border strongholds until the loss of Normandy by King John.<br>
<br>In the south, where again Rufus campaigned with the lord of Bell&ecirc;me, he strove to dislodge Helias de la Fl&egrave;che, who had established himself as count of Maine with the support of the bishop of Le Mans, Hildebert de Lavardin, the most famous Latin poet of his age. The Angevins, hereditary enemies of the Normans, watched anxiously. In this theatre Rufus had better luck. In April 1098 Robert de Bell&ecirc;me ambushed and captured Helias and surrendered him to the king, who put him in honourable custody at Bayeux. But Foulques, count of Anjou, then occupied Le Mans, the chief city. By June Rufus had assembled an army and marched south. The nobility and church marginally preferred Norman to Angevin rule and Foulques was persuaded to come to terms with Rufus. It was agreed that Le Mans and all the other towns which the Conqueror had possessed should be returned to his son and that all the prisoners should be exchanged. In July the king entered Le Mans in triumph and was led by the bishop to the cathedral church, where he issued laws. When he returned to Normandy he sent for Helias, agreed to release him, but refused to recognize him as count of Maine. Their interview at Rouen is graphically reconstructed by William of Malmesbury, who, in this context, believed that the soul of Julius Caesar had, by transmigration, passed into Rufus. The king exclaimed, &#145;I've got you, sir.&#146; To which Helias replied, &#145;Only by a fluke! And if I can escape, I know what I'm going to do.&#146; &#145;You do? You clown you. You do?&#146;, the king shouted, stuttering with rage.<blockquote>Do you think I care what you would do? Get out! Clear off! You can do whatever you want. And, by the face of Lucca, if next time you're the winner, I shan't be asking you for something in return for this. (<span class="italic">De gestis regum</span>, 320)</blockquote>Rufus's frontier wars and the absence of some of the nobility on crusade seem to have led to a general internal peace. And, although there is little documentation, it is likely that he introduced as much as he could of orderly government on the English pattern and that he would have exercised all his judicial, financial, and military rights. He returned to England at Easter 1099, and at Whitsun held a very grand court at Westminster, when Edgar, king of Scots (<i>d</i>. 1107), his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, carried the sword of state before him at the crown-wearing ceremony in the abbey. Afterwards they all feasted in his splendid new hall at Westminster, an occasion so memorable that the twelfth-century poet Geoffrey Gaimar described it in detail in his <span class="italic">Lestorie des Engles</span>. But the king was soon recalled to the continent. In June, while he was hunting in the New Forest in Hampshire, a messenger arrived with the news that Helias had re-entered Le Mans, that the Norman garrison was still holding out in the fortifications and had burnt down most of the city, and that Robert de Bell&ecirc;me was waiting at Ballon for the king's arrival. Rufus, it is said, immediately turned his horse and made for the coast, forced a fearful ship's captain to set sail in a storm&#151;joking that never had he heard of a king lost by wreck at sea and prophesying that the wind and sea would obey his commands&#151;gathered troops in Normandy, and quickly relieved the beleaguered garrison. But he could do little more. Although he chased Helias into his estates in the south of Maine he failed to storm the castle at Mayet, where he was almost struck by a stone thrown from the keep, and had to content himself with devastating the countryside, ordering the destruction of the towers of the unfinished cathedral at Le Mans, and carrying off the bishop as a prisoner to England. In return, Hildebert, in a poem, called the king a tyrant, in his fickleness and deceit the equal of Fortune herself, a defender of all the vices, a man who had brought nothing but shame on the heads of his ancestors. Rufus allowed Hildebert to return to his see after Easter 1100; and the poet took back many ornaments for his church, perhaps royal gifts.<br>
<br>By that time William had to prepare for Robert's return from the crusade. He would have heard that his brother had distinguished himself in that remarkably successful holy war, that he was slowly making his way back, that he had wintered in Sicily, and that he had just married Sibyl, the daughter of Geoffrey of Conversano, lord of Brindisi in Apulia, a scion of the dynasty created by the Norman adventurer Tancred d'Hauteville. Robert was clearly returning with the intention of redeeming his duchy, and in his wife's dowry had the means to do so. It is not known how Rufus regarded the matter. But, as Robert was returning as a hero in a religious cause, a married man with the cash for paying off his creditor, it would seem, and to judge by Rufus's previous behaviour be likely, that the king would try to make a deal with his brother, either a condominium or a repartition. It is noticeable that Rufus, after the autumn of 1099, far from attempting to strengthen his position in Normandy, spent his time with Henry and some important Norman barons, hunting in England. He could, of course, have returned with these at any moment to confront his brother, but hardly to prevent his entry into the duchy or to disinherit him. As for Henry, on any analysis of the situation it would seem that he had more to gain by staying with the king for the time being. It also seems that Guillaume (IX) of Aquitaine wanted to imitate Robert and pawn some lands&#151;perhaps Poitou&#151;to Rufus in order to finance a trip to Jerusalem. William of Malmesbury reports that the king, on the day before he died, when asked where he intended to spend Christmas, replied &#145;Poitiers&#146;. It is just possible that he was considering a substitute for Normandy. But how serious these negotiations were is uncertain.<h2>
<a name="Theendofthereign"></a>The end of the reign</h2>On Thursday 2 August 1100 Rufus was at a hunting lodge, probably Brockenhurst, in the New Forest. Contrary to his usual custom he did not go out until the afternoon, when the royal party, which included his brother Henry, broke up into small groups, each to take up position at a butt. There they would have waited, dismounted, to shoot at deer driven across their front by beaters. Where Rufus was stationed is disputed: both a site near Canterton, where the &#145;Rufus Stone&#146; was erected in 1745 (more exactly, Stricknage Wood, otherwise known as Castle Malwood Walk), and the lost village of Througham, represented now by Beaulieu, have their supporters. In attendance on the king, it seems to have been widely believed, was Walter Tirel, count of Poix, near Amiens, a fine soldier whom Rufus had probably recruited during his Vexin wars. But, instead of a beast, it was the king who was brought down, killed instantly by an arrow in the heart. There is no good reason to think that it was anything but a (fairly common) hunting accident. Both the king's elder brother, Richard, and, quite recently, his nephew Richard, one of Robert's bastards, had died in this way, the latter likewise in the New Forest. The earliest description of the king's death, in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, attributes the fatal arrow to one of the king's own men. Later, William of Malmesbury, and his successors, named the count of Poix, who had immediately left the scene and returned home post-haste. But Abbot Suger of St Denis, the friend and biographer of King Louis VI of France, claimed that he had often heard Walter affirm on the solemnest of oaths that on that day he neither was in the king's company nor even caught sight of him. However that may be, all early commentators agreed that the archer was simply God's instrument to avenge the making of the New Forest and to punish a blasphemer. Most also drew attention to the portents and marvels that presaged, accompanied, and followed this event. The violent death of a king was a very disturbing affair. But it was left to a few modern historians to imagine that it was a premeditated murder to secure the throne for Henry before the arrival of Robert Curthose.<br>
<br>Rufus's death initially further confused, although ultimately possibly simplified, an already disturbed political scene. Henry certainly quickly realized what he had to do. He rode to Winchester to seize the royal treasury and managed to arrange an almost immediate coronation (on Sunday 5 August) by the bishop of London, in the unavoidable absence of Anselm. No one had much time for the dead man. His body was carried on a wagon by some of the inferior hunt servants to Winchester and buried the following morning (Friday 3 August) in the Old Minster, in the centre of the choir beneath the tower, with minimal, if any, rites and a far from distinguished congregation. Henry was too busy to attend. Although the cathedral tower collapsed in 1107, it would seem that the tomb remained intact until about 1525, when Bishop Fox, as part of his improvements, erected stone screens on both sides of the presbytery and deposited the contents of the graves he disturbed, including that of William Rufus, in six mortuary chests which he placed on top of the screens. By 1683, however, a coffin of oolite stone, covered with a coped slab of Purbeck marble, which stood before the high altar in the choir and would seem to be twelfth century, was known as Rufus's tomb. This, which had been rifled by Oliver Cromwell's men in 1642, was reopened on 27 August 1868 in preparation for its removal to its present location in the presbytery. A much disturbed skeleton of a man, 5 feet 8 inches or more tall, a chalice, and the fragments of a wooden shaft and iron head, which were then discovered, have been thought to be relics of the king which had been overlooked in 1525 and 1642. But opinion is divided.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentandreputation"></a>Assessment and reputation</h2>William Rufus became a scandalous figure, the subject of much gossip. His outrageous remarks were collected and even monastic writers could not always conceal their delight. A rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality&#151;indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy&#151;he nevertheless could not simply be written off as a degenerate wastrel. His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered Maine, and kept up the pressure on the Vexin. His wars had been costly, and not all had been cost effective; but he impressed contemporaries as being a victorious general. Moreover, at the time of his death it was believed that he was about to add Poitou, even perhaps Aquitaine, to his dominions, that he contemplated invading Ireland, and that he aspired to the French throne. After all, at his death he was only of the age of his father when he had won a kingdom on Senlac Field. For those who die young the possibilities are endless. Geoffrey of Monmouth, who, towards the end of Henry I's reign, created a history of Britain, modelled his King Arthur in part on William Rufus, and Geoffrey Gaimar in turn borrowed from Arthur in order to embellish his picture of Rufus. Even the clergy did not expect a king to be a saint. They were quite happy with a hero.<br>
