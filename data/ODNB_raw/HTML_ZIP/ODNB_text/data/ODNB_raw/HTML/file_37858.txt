<span class="headword">Plummer,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1410&#150;1484), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was one of the leading musicians of the generation following Lionel Power and John Dunstaple. He was also, from 1444 to 1455, the first holder of the newly created post of master (or warden) of the children of the Chapel Royal, the household chapel of the English kings. Nothing is known of his parentage or birth, though his career suggests that he was probably born about 1410.<br>
<br>He first appears in the records as a junior clerk or singing man in Henry VI's Chapel Royal, in 1441. The document authorizes an unusually large payment, and it has been plausibly conjectured that it was intended to reimburse him for expenses connected with the &#145;impressing&#146; of choirboys for the chapel, which had been ordered in 1440. In 1444 he was officially entrusted with the care, maintenance, and teaching of the eight chapel children: the creation of Plummer's post probably reflects the growing use of treble voices in part-music as well as in plainchant.<br>
<br>On giving up the mastership in 1455 Plummer became verger of the royal free chapel of St George at Windsor Castle, with important administrative as well as processional duties; he retained this post until his presumed death in 1484, when he was paid for the last time, and for only part of the year. Though the surviving attendance registers attest his regular presence in Windsor, he continued as a clerk of the Chapel Royal under Edward IV, no doubt on an occasional basis, becoming senior clerk by 1465 and figuring in the last surviving account for 1467. In Windsor he was active as a man of property and left money, with his wife, Agatha, to endow a chantry. He may have been married before: a Johanna (Joan) Plummer was a member of the Confraternity of St Nicholas or London guild of parish clerks at the same time as himself, and died in 1457.<br>
<br>Six surviving compositions may be ascribed with certainty to Plummer, namely two movements of a four-voice tenor mass with the antiphon &#145;Nesciens mater&#146; as its tenor, and three three-voice settings of Marian antiphons which do not use the chant and must have been sung as votive memorial pieces; his masterpiece, <span class="italic">Anna mater matris Christi</span>, sets a respond, again without the chant, in a remarkable texture of three equal tenors with an optional treble part riding above&#151;certainly a fitting example of the art of the master of the chapel children. Plummer's music, like that of Dunstaple and Power, was valued abroad and appears in continental manuscripts. He was one of the first composers to experiment with pervasive imitation and invertible counterpoint, a generation before Josquin des Prez. Two further mass cycles and a votive antiphon, anonymously transmitted, are also believed to be his.<br>
