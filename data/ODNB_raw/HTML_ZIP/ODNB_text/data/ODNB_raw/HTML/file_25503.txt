<span class="headword">Sibly,  Manoah</span>  (1757&#150;1840), <span class="occ">Swedenborgian minister and banker</span>, was born at Bristol on 20 August 1757. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25502/', "Ebenezer Sibly (1751&#150;c.1799)")</script>, a notable publisher of esoteric lore, and was himself an autodidact and nonconformist, self-taught in the classical and biblical languages, part of the self-taught artisan culture. He specialized in alchemy and astrology, and became for a period a bookseller in Goswell Street, London, specializing in books on the occult, some of which his brother was then publishing. He himself translated two astrological works by Palcidus de Titis, but his first work, <span class="italic">A critical essay on Jer. xxxiii.16 (latter part) wherein the misinterpretations of the sacred text are confuted</span> (1777), demonstrated his competence in Hebrew scholarship. He also served as a shorthand writer, and wrote the transcripts of the trials of Thelwall and Hardy. On 7 May 1780, at St Luke, Old Street, Finsbury, he married an orphan named Sarah Lack (<i>d</i>. 1829), and they lived happily until her death, with eleven children, although only two survived him.<br>
<br>It fitted entirely with his idiosyncratic radicalism that in 1787 Sibly adopted Swedenborgian ideas, and, after serving as a lay preacher along with others, was ordained a minister of the New Jerusalem church on 7 April 1790, although serving the London congregation only on a part-time basis. After a schism in 1793 he was appointed minister of a congregationally based group meeting first in Store Street, Tottenham Court Road, then in Red Cross Street, Cripplegate, then the Cross Street Chapel, which Joseph Proud had abandoned, then at Cateaton Street; the meeting erected its own chapel in Friars Street, Blackfriars, in 1803. Although never attracting as many followers as Joseph Proud's London chapel, it was generally reckoned to provide a purer species of Swedenborgian dogma, for Sibly provided a rather meticulous and knowledgeable interpretation of Swedenborgian doctrines, yet to judge from his published sermons (twelve of which were published in 1796 and another seven at other times during his ministry), he remained a rather inward-looking pedant. From 1797 he served in the Bank of England in order to avoid Sunday work, and rose to head their chancery office. He died on 16 December 1840, and was buried in Bunhill Fields.<br>
