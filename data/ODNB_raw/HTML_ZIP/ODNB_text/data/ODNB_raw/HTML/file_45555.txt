<span class="headword">Jackson,  Mason</span>  (1819&#150;1903), <span class="occ">wood-engraver and journalist</span>, was born at Ovington, Northumberland, the son of John Jackson, a husbandman, and the younger brother of the wood-engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14534/', "John Jackson (1801&#150;1848)")</script>. The elder brother, having learned his craft with Thomas Bewick, went to London and was joined about 1830 by Mason, whom he then trained as a wood-engraver. By 1836 Mason Jackson was engraving after Richard Seymour for the green wrapper of Dickens's <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span> and for S. C. Hall's <span class="italic">Book of British Ballads</span> (1842). He married on 25 September 1849 Catherine Common of Gosforth, Northumberland; their daughter Catherine was born in 1851. From 1846 to 1863 Jackson was entered in directories as a wood-engraver, at 12 Cardington Street, off Hampstead Road, where after his wife's death he lived with his brother and his family. He married secondly Lucy Berriman Tippetts (<i>b</i>. 1838) on 16 July 1864, and thereafter worked from his home at 12 Pembroke Gardens, Kensington, where they brought up their three children, <a href="#cosubject_45555">Arthur Mason Tippetts Jackson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Herbert, and Lucy.<br>
<br>During the 1850s and 1860s Jackson produced engravings for numerous magazines and books, among them several series published by Charles Knight, the <span class="italic">Art Union of London</span> (1850&#150;60), <span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated Family Paper</span> (1857), and the <span class="italic">Illustrated London Almanack</span> (1850&#150;51), signing &#145;M. JACKSON SC&#146;. In 1850 he began engraving for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, reproducing in full and double-page engravings the drawings and paintings of prominent contemporary artists. From 1860 to 1895 he was also the art editor of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>, and on retirement in 1896 he was briefly a director. His book <span class="italic">The Pictorial Press: its Origins and Progress</span> (1885) traced the rise of illustrated journalism from its hesitant beginnings to his own times. In addition, Jackson exhibited his landscape paintings from 1856 to 1879 at the Royal Academy and other London galleries. He died at his home, 79 Warwick Road, Brompton, on 29 December 1903 and was buried at Brompton cemetery. The <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist commented, &#145;By his death journalism has lost one of its most respected veterans&#146;, and described him as &#145;a genial and upright man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 Jan 1904, 4a).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_45555"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Mason Tippetts Jackson</span>  (1866&#150;1909) was born at the family home, 12 Pembroke Gardens, Kensington, on 30 December 1866. He was educated at Westminster School from 1880 to 1884, then went with a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford. A gifted oriental linguist, he gained the Boden prize for Sanskrit and graduated BA first class in 1888. He was called to the bar at Middle Temple in November of that year, by which time he had already secured the Indian Civil Service prize for Sanskrit, and was in India by December, where he rapidly increased his knowledge of vernacular languages.<br>
<br>Based in the Bombay presidency, Jackson held a number of legal and administrative posts, including that of private secretary to Lord Sandhurst, then governor of Bombay, from 1898 to 1900. He was also superintendent in charge of the revision of the <span class="italic">Imperial Gazetteer</span>. He was able to study in the library of the Royal Asiatic Society, was briefly its honorary secretary, and published in its journals. On the occasions when he was back in England, Jackson examined for Oxford University.<br>
<br>By December 1909 Jackson had risen to the rank of senior collector, stationed at Nasik, and was about to transfer to Bombay for a further promotion. On 22 December a farewell entertainment was being held in his honour at the theatre in Nasik; as Jackson and his wife entered, a young Hindu shot at him several times, and he died instantly. The assassination was undoubtedly political and part of a Brahman rebellion against the government; Jackson had earlier tried the killer's cousin for seditious conspiracy, and a higher court had sentenced him to transportation for life. But even in Nasik, a Brahmanical centre, Jackson's personal kindness had made him much loved, and he was admired and respected for his grasp of Indian languages. A large gathering accompanied his body to the local cemetery at Nasik for burial on 23 December.<br>
