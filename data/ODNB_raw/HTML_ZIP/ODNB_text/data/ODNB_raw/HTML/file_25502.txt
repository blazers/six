<span class="headword">Sibly,  Ebenezer</span>  (1751&#150;<em>c.</em>1799), <span class="occ">astrologer and physician</span>, was born in Bristol on 30 January 1751. The names of his parents are not known. The Swedenborgian preacher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25503/', "Manoah Sibly")</script> was his brother, and there was also another brother and a sister of whom nothing is known. Their father was described as a mechanic. His mother died in 1768, whereupon he was removed from school, perhaps to assist in his father's business. None the less, he continued to study on his own, becoming a formidable polymath in medicine, natural philosophy, and occultism, both traditional and contemporary.<br>
<br>By 1784 Sibly was living in Portsmouth, where he was initiated into freemasonry&#151;the beginning of a lifelong involvement, in the course of which he joined several different lodges, and founded one. In this context he was sometimes known as Noah Sibly or Father Noah. He also completed his first book there, from an address somewhere on Portsmouth Common: it was a massive compendium of astrology, occult philosophy, and magic, entitled <span class="italic">A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology</span>, first published in four parts (1784&#150;8). It obviously met a need, for by 1812 there had been twelve editions, some appearing under the title <span class="italic">A New and Complete Illustration of the Occult Sciences</span>. The last known edition appeared in 1826.<br>
<br>About 1785 Sibly returned to Bristol. He acted briefly as an official agent for the sale of lottery tickets but this aspect of his career was cut short when he was duped into selling false tickets by one John Wilkes of Winchester and the racket was discovered. Sibly swore his innocence in an affidavit before the mayor of Bristol on 31 January 1786, and there the matter ended. By about 1788, Sibly had moved to London, where he remained. In 1795 his address was 1 Upper Titchfield Street, and the following year he was living at 40 New Bridge Street, near St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>In 1789 Sibly founded a new lodge of freemasonry&#151;no. 253, later known as the Lodge of Joppa&#151;which met at The Globe inn, Hatton Garden. He had marked political views, and was a supporter of the American War of Independence. In 1790 he briefly moved to Ipswich in order to campaign vigorously (and successfully) for the whig candidate, Sir John Hadley D'Oyly. On 20 April 1792 he obtained his MD from King's College, Aberdeen (there is no evidence he ever actually lived there).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Sibly had also become a fellow of the Harmonic Philosophical Society, founded in Paris to promote mesmerism. He quickly incorporated mesmerism, or animal magnetism, into his system, as another example of new discoveries confirming and extending ancient wisdom concerning forces of sympathy and antipathy. More work was also forthcoming. In 1789, a new edition of the extremely popular and durable <span class="italic">Culpeper's English Physician and Complete Herbal</span> appeared, with fourteen editions under Sibly's name by 1813; in 1794 came Sibly's <span class="italic">A Key to Physic and the Occult Sciences</span>, which reached five editions by 1814; <span class="italic">The Medical Mirror</span> reached six editions by 1814; and the first volume of the <span class="italic">Magazine of Natural History</span> appeared in 1796.<br>
<br>This prodigious output amounted to about 2500 quarto pages, and all the major works were available until well into the first half of the nineteenth century. Their chief interest lies in the way they straddle and unite what are often thought to be the two irreconcilable worlds of ancient magic and modern science: that is, hermetic magic and occultism, with its focus on the sympathetic and antipathetic connections between macrocosm and microcosm, whether human or natural, and contemporary Enlightenment demonstrations of progress, both in human affairs and in knowledge. Sibly thus combined his whig reforming-populist zeal and freemasonic esoteric idealism with the tradition of vulgate self-help manuals of physic and astrology (the poor man's science, so to speak) initiated by Culpeper and other radicals during the revolution in English astrology. He freely mixed the experimental natural philosophy of Newton, Lavoisier, and Priestley with the cosmologies of Hermes Trismegistus, Paracelsus, and the alchemists. Unusually for an eighteenth-century figure, Sibly believed that the experimental and observational discoveries of the modern natural philosophers refined and developed the insights of the alchemical and magical cosmologists, while the vitalism and spirituality of the ancients corrected the tendencies toward atheism and materialism of the moderns.<br>
<br>Sibly's presentation of physic was also suffused with the natural magic of alchemy and astrology, whereby every organ and function has both macrocosmic and microcosmic counterparts within a system of spiritual hierarchies and occult properties. By this reasoning the heart, for example, relates to the sun, to certain herbs such as St John's wort, to gold, and to other items which bear sun-like qualities. When focused on plants and metals, this logic suggests appropriate natural remedies for diseases. Such medicines were often cheaply available, unlike more expensive and invasive procedures. Sibly's <span class="italic">Medical Mirror</span> was another instance of medical popularization, offering an accessible (if rather florid) account of human anatomy and physiology, including the delicate subject of reproduction.<br>
<br>Within the astrological tradition, Sibly's <span class="italic">Illustration</span> was the first comprehensive textbook for decades, covering judicial astrology (including both the genethliacal, or natal, and the horary branches) as well as mundane and meteorological applications. Also included were sections on natural and occult philosophy, witchcraft, ceremonial magic, and necromancy&#151;the last presented as a warning, in a satisfyingly sensational manner. Synthetic, eclectic, and populist, it incorporated a largely magical world-view, all things for which it was strongly criticized by the only other nationally known astrologer of the day, and an Aristotelian rationalist, John Worsdale. But it was precisely this approach that guaranteed Sibly the wide readership that Worsdale never attained.<br>
<br>Sibly also continued the provocative tradition of apparently correct astrological predictions (or prophecies) of spectacular public events. In an essay first published in 1787, analysing the sun's ingress into Aries (at the vernal point) on 19 March 1789, Sibly concluded that:<blockquote>here is every prospect &hellip; that some very important event will happen in the politics of France, such as may dethrone, or very nearly touch the life of, the king, and make victims of many great and illustrious men in church and state, preparatory to a revolution &hellip; which will at once astonish and surprise the surrounding nations. (Sibly, 1051)</blockquote>A century earlier, such a forecast and its fulfilment (with the French Revolution of 1789) would have guaranteed its author national fame and/or notoriety, as happened in the case of William Lilly and the great fire of London. But, at the end of the eighteenth century, it drew little or no comment, any more than the rest of Sibly's voluminous published work, despite its popularity, received informed appraisal from his educated and professional contemporaries. This reception points to the way professional and disciplinary boundaries of knowledge had hardened, firmly excluding anything explicitly identifiable as occult, magical, or astrological.<br>
<br>At the same time, however, the middle classes at the end of the eighteenth century were beginning to grow in power and complexity, and, as part of that process, began showing patchy signs of intellectual independence from patrician hegemony. One early sign was the new market Sibly found (and helped create) among semi-erudite middle-class urban readers for a popular magical science. This was a niche that the new almanacs of Zadkiel and Raphael would further exploit and develop from the 1830s onwards. Sibly is thus a key figure in the revival of astrology and natural magic after its apparently terminal decline during the Enlightenment.<br>
<br>Sibly is believed to have died in London about 1799, in an obscurity that says as much about his times as it does about himself.<br>
