<span class="headword">Paul,  William</span>  (1822&#150;1905), <span class="occ">horticulturist</span>, was born at Churchgate, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, on 16 June 1822, the second son of Adam Paul (<i>d</i>. 1847), a nurseryman of Huguenot descent, originally from Aberdeenshire, who purchased the Cheshunt nursery in 1806. He was educated at a private school at Waltham Cross before joining his father's business. Following his father's death he and his elder brother, George, continued the business as A. Paul &amp; Son. In 1860 this partnership was dissolved and his brother established the firm of Paul &amp; Son at Cheshunt, while Paul himself concentrated on the Waltham Cross nursery, William Paul &amp; Son, which he had founded in 1859.<br>
<br>Paul's earliest literary work was for John Claudius Loudon (1783&#150;1843). Following Loudon's death he wrote articles for John Lindley; his series of articles entitled &#145;Roses in pots&#146;, which appeared in 1843 in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>, were issued separately in the same year, and reached a ninth edition in 1908. Paul's book, <span class="italic">The Rose Garden</span> (1848), was also immensely popular, reaching a tenth edition by 1903 and being reprinted as late as 1978. It is a practical treatise to which Paul's wide reading gave a literary character. Coloured illustrations initially made the book expensive; later editions were issued in two forms, with and without these plates.<br>
<br>Paul served on the committee of the National Floricultural Society from 1851 until it was dissolved in 1858. In July 1858 he joined the newly founded National Rose Society, and in 1866 he was one of the executive committee of twenty-one members for the great International Horticultural Exhibition. He also acted as a commissioner for the Paris Exhibition of 1867. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1875, and received the Victoria medal of horticulture when it was first instituted in 1897.<br>
<br>Although best known as a rosarian, Paul also devoted attention to the improvement of other types of plants, such as hollyhocks, asters, hyacinths, phloxes, camellias, zonal pelargoniums, hollies, ivies, shrubs, fruit trees, and Brussels sprouts. He dealt with these subjects in <span class="italic">American Plants, their History and Culture</span> (1858), <span class="italic">Lecture on the Hyacinth</span> (1864), and papers on hollyhocks (1851) and &#145;Tree scenery&#146; (1870&#150;72). He contributed papers on the varieties of yew and holly to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Horticultural Society</span> (1861, 1863). In addition to the <span class="italic">Rose Annual</span>, which he issued from 1858 to 1881, Paul was associated with his friends Dr Robert Hogg and Thomas Moore in the editorship of the <span class="italic">Florist and Pomologist</span> from 1868 to 1874. Clear and fluent as a speaker, he proved an acceptable lecturer. One of his best lectures, &#145;Improvements in plants&#146;, at Manchester in 1869, was included in his <span class="italic">Contributions to Horticultural Literature, 1843&#150;1892</span> (1892).<br>
<br>Paul died at Waltham Cross of a paralytic seizure on 31 March 1905, and was buried in the family vault at Cheshunt cemetery. His wife, Amelia Jane Harding, predeceased him. His business was carried on by his son, Arthur William Paul. His rich library of old gardening books and general literature was sold at Sothebys after his death, but many volumes were bought by his son.<br>
