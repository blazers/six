<span class="headword">Heurtley,  Charles Abel</span>  (1806&#150;1895), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, born on 4 January 1806 at Bishopwearmouth, in co. Durham, was the son of Charles Abel Heurtley (1740&#150;1806), a banker at Sunderland, and his wife, Isabella Hunter (<i>d</i>. 1816), of Newcastle upon Tyne. After his father's death Heurtley's mother married Mr Metcalfe, shipbuilder of South Shields. On his father's side he was directly descended from one Charles Abel Herteleu, a Huguenot, who in the early days of the eighteenth century migrated from his home at Rennes in Brittany in order to secure liberty to profess the protestant faith. Heurtley, who was himself a staunch protestant, always rejoiced in his descent from one who had thus suffered for his faith.<br>
<br>In 1813 Heurtley was sent to a school at West Boldon, near Gateshead, and in 1817 he passed on to another at Witton-le-Wear, near Bishop Auckland, a private school which at that time had a considerable reputation. Here he stayed for four years, and, as his guardians were extremely desirous that he should become a man of business, he was sent in 1822 to Liverpool as a clerk in the office of Messrs Brereton and Newsham, timber merchants. After nine months' trial, he was confirmed in his original purpose of going to university with a view to entering the church. Accordingly he returned to education at Louth grammar school in Lincolnshire, Sedbergh being too full to take him, and after ten months' work there was elected in 1823 to a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, open to boys born in the diocese of Durham.<br>
<br>Heurtley graduated BA with first-class honours in mathematics in June 1827, winning the Ellerton theological essay prize in the following year. He was an unsuccessful candidate for a fellowship at Oriel in 1828, but, after spending four years as second master at the newly founded Brompton grammar school (1828&#150;31), he succeeded to a fellowship at Corpus in 1832, which he held until 1841. In 1831 he graduated MA, was ordained, and served the curacy of Wardington, near Cropredy, Oxfordshire, until 1840, when he was appointed to the college living of Fenny Compton, Warwickshire. During this period he was also reader in Latin at Corpus (1832&#150;5), select preacher before the university (1834 and 1838), and junior dean of his college (1838). He graduated BD in 1838 and DD in 1853. On 10 April 1844 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1893), daughter of Revd William Bagshaw Harrison, vicar of Goudhurst, Kent. He was Bampton lecturer in 1845, and on 2 July 1853 was elected Margaret professor of divinity at Oxford, which was tenable with a canonry at Christ Church, Oxford. He held the chair and canonry for forty-two years, combining them with the rectory of Fenny Compton until 1872.<br>
<br>Learned, courteous, retiring, reading and thinking much, but writing little, Heurtley represented the older type of Oxford scholar, whose influence depended rather upon his personal relations with members of the university than upon the effect of his written works on the world at large. He set great store by his university sermons, preaching over sixty during his lifetime. He sat as one of the theological assessors in the court that tried Archdeacon Denison for unsound eucharistic doctrine (1856). He contributed to <span class="italic">Aids to Faith</span> (1861), the orthodox response to the controversial <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>. In 1873 he entered a strong protest, on theological grounds, against the granting of an honorary degree upon Professor John Tyndall, and in the same year he protested against the precedence accorded to Cardinal Manning at the jubilee dinner of the Oxford Union. His action in these matters was typical of his theological position. He had a profound devotion to the Church of England, and conceived its position mainly on the lines of the evangelical party. But he was not a party man, as was shown in a very striking way when in advanced years (1890) he preached a sermon in the cathedral deploring hasty and unmeasured condemnation of the &#145;higher criticism&#146;. His practical gifts were displayed in his parish at Fenny Compton, where he successfully organized a small company to provide a proper water supply for the village.<br>
<br>Heurtley's written work consisted largely of sermons. Of these the most considerable volume is his Bampton lectures, <span class="italic">Justification</span> (1845), in which he adopted &#145;a moderate and learned Evangelical Protestant position&#146;  (Toon, 60). But he also published a series of works on creeds and formularies of faith, the main subject of his study and of his lectures, of which <span class="italic">De fide et symbolo</span> (1864) was widely used in theological colleges. His latest work, revealing his patristic scholarship, was <span class="italic">A History of the Earlier Formularies of the Western and Eastern Churches</span> (1892). Many of his parochial sermons were published, and he was the writer of a number of tracts circulated by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.<br>
<br>Heurtley died at Christ Church, Oxford, on 1 May 1895 and was buried beside his wife at Osney cemetery on 3 May. He left one son, Charles Abel Heurtley, who became rector of Ashington, Sussex, and three daughters, of whom the eldest, Isabella, married Sydney Linton (1841&#150;1894), the first bishop of Riverina, Australia. To his memoirist Heurtley's life exemplified a combination of deep personal religion and critical theological study within the secularized academy.<br>
