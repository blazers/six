<span class="headword">Hodgkin,  John</span>  (1766&#150;1845), <span class="occ">grammarian and calligrapher</span>, was born at Shipston-on-Stour, Worcestershire, on 11 February 1766, the son of John Hodgkin, shopkeeper and wool stapler, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gibbs. He was educated partly at a Quakers' school at Worcester, and partly by his uncle, Thomas Hodgkin, a successful private tutor in London, who invited his nephew to enter his own profession. In 1787 he joined the physicist and Egyptologist Thomas Young in superintending the education of the antiquary Hudson Gurney. The two tutors seem to have given each other mutual instruction for four years, and all remained warm friends. He was briefly a master at Ackworth Friends' school, Yorkshire, before leaving for France.<br>
<br>In 1792 Hodgkin spent some months at Vincennes in order to improve his knowledge of French. His recollections of the royal family are recorded in his manuscript autobiography (Wellcome Institute, London). When Louis XVI took the oath to the constitution, Hodgkin, as a Quaker, had a conscientious objection to raise his hand with the multitude swearing fidelity to the compact between king and people, while his plain dress caused him to be continually taken for a priest. He managed, however, to escape real danger. He describes in graphic language the consternation at Vincennes on 10 August 1792, the day of the massacre of the Swiss guard.<br>
<br>Upon his return to England Hodgkin married on 1 May 1793 at Lewes, Sussex, Elizabeth Rickman, a cousin of Thomas Rickman the architect. Their sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13429/', "Thomas Hodgkin (1798&#150;1866)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13428/', "John Hodgkin (1800&#150;1875)")</script> are noticed separately. Hodgkin soon became well known as a private tutor, chiefly to ladies belonging to the families of wealthy citizens in the environs of London. He resided for some years at Pentonville, London, and then moved to Tottenham. He instructed his pupils in the classics and mathematics, but especially in the art of handwriting, in which he greatly excelled.<br>
<br>Hodgkin has left a remarkable record of his skill in handwriting in his <span class="italic">Calligraphia Gr&aelig;ca</span> (1794), dedicated to Hodgkin's friend Thomas Young, at whose suggestion it was composed. Young also furnished the gnomic sentences from various authors, which Hodgkin wrote in beautiful Greek characters, and his friend Henry Ashby engraved. A translation by Young of Lear's curse into Greek iambics, undertaken &#145;rogatu viri omnium disertissimi Edmundi Burke&#146;, was also added. The work was not published until 1807, when it appeared together with <span class="italic">P&#339;cilographia Gr&aelig;ca</span>, in which nineteen Greek alphabets of various periods are figured, and some seven hundred contractions used in Greek manuscripts are given. Some of the latter were brought to Hodgkin's notice by the Greek scholar Richard Porson, with whom he had a slight acquaintance. Hodgkin also published, besides school and exercise books: <span class="italic">Definitions of some of the Terms Made Use of in Geography and Astronomy</span> (1804; 2nd edn, 1812); <span class="italic">Specimens of Greek Penmanship</span> (1804); <span class="italic">An Introduction to Writing</span> (4th edn, 1811); and <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Greek Accidence</span> (1812). He contributed to <span class="italic">Excerpta ex J. F. Bastii commentatione cum tabulis lithographicis a J. Hodgkin transcripta</span> (1835). He died in August 1845 at Tottenham, Middlesex, and was survived by his wife.<br>
