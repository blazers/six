<span class="headword">Seymour <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Stanhope]</span>,  Anne</span>, duchess of Somerset  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1587), <span class="occ">noblewoman and literary patron</span>, was the only child of Sir Edward Stanhope (<i>d</i>. 1511) of Rampton, Nottinghamshire, by his second wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. before 1473, <i>d</i>. 1557), daughter of Fulk Bourchier, Lord Fitzwarine, a descendant of Edward III. After her father's death her mother married Sir Richard Page of Beechwood, Hertfordshire. Some time before 9 March 1535 Anne married, as his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Sir Edward Seymour (c.1500&#150;1552)")</script> who was ennobled as earl of Hertford in 1537. Henry VIII visited them at Elvetham, Hampshire, in 1535 and at Wolfhall, Wiltshire, in 1539. They were installed at Greenwich Palace in 1536 to chaperone Edward's sister Jane, who succeeded Anne Boleyn as queen.<br>
<br>Anne Seymour gave birth to ten children: Edward (<i>b</i>. 1537), who died in infancy; Anne (<i>b</i>. 1538); a second Edward (<i>b</i>. 1539); Henry (<i>b</i>. 1540); Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1540); Jane (<i>b</i>. 1541); then Mary and Catherine; in 1548 a third Edward, godchild of Edward VI, who died in 1574; and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1550). Following royal practice the Seymours offered their three eldest daughters classical instruction. Anne herself participated in Anne of Cleves's reception and served as lady-in-waiting to Katherine Howard and in the privy chamber of Katherine Parr. Validating vague literary tradition, some scholars have identified her with the wolf in Surrey's poem &#145;Eche beast can chose hys fere according to his minde&#146;, which refuses the advances of the lion&#151;that is, a lady who refuses to dance with the poet  (Sessions).<br>
<br>After Edward's accession in 1547 and Hertford's elevation as lord protector and duke of Somerset Anne protested against Katherine Parr's marriage to her brother-in-law Thomas, Lord Seymour of Sudeley. John Foxe reported that &#145;upon what occasion&#146; he knew not &#145;a displeasure betwixt&#146; the ladies escalated into a conflict between their spouses, and that unconfirmed rumours claimed that Anne had manipulated Somerset into executing Seymour in 1549  (Foxe, 5.283). Embellishing Foxe's comments Nicolas Sander and John Hayward charged Anne, whom they characterized as extremely proud and domineering, with demanding precedence over the queen dowager, a claim lacking contemporary corroboration. It has been argued, moreover, that John Strype misread &#145;duchess&#146; for &#145;duke&#146; as the addressee of Sir Thomas Smith's letter of 1547, in which he responded to charges that he lacked religious fervour  (Nichols, 380). Modern writers have favoured the Sander&#150;Hayward characterization, perhaps to offset the invention of Somerset as the good duke. Though historians, including M. L. Bush, challenged this invention they mostly validated Strype's judgement of Anne, while omitting references to the extensive evidence of her deep religious faith, such as Foxe's confirmation of John Bale's claim that she gave 10<i>s</i>. to the protestant martyr Anne Askew in 1545.<br>
<br>After Katherine Parr's death in 1548 the duchess briefly sheltered the late queen's infant and assumed her sponsorship of the second volume of the translations of Erasmus's <span class="italic">Paraphrases</span>, which appeared twice in 1549 with John Olde's dedication to her. In 1549&#150;50, as a patron, she contended with William Paget and Katherine, duchess of Suffolk, for resources for her clients. In 1550, having earlier apologized for his wife's offence, Sir John Cheke thanked Lady Somerset for supporting his court appointment. Between 1548 and 1551 nine additional publications saluted Anne, a larger number than for any other woman in early Tudor England. In her honour Walter Lynne produced three volumes, plus a translation of Bullinger's biblical concordance; Nicholas Lesse two translations (of Francis Lambet and of Augustine); William Samuel his <span class="italic">Abridgement of God's Statutes</span>; and the family chaplain, Thomas Becon, dedicated to her a work entitled <span class="italic">The Flower of Godly Prayers</span>, which, reprinted twice, praised her godliness, liberality, &#145;gentle nature&#146;, and patronage of learning. At Martin Bucer's death in 1551 Anne obtained most of his books. Between 1560 and 1570, with their dedications, Becon's <span class="italic">Prayers</span> was reprinted three times and Lynne's <span class="italic">Concordance</span> once. In 1570 Edward Crane and in 1585 Ephraim Pagett dedicated translations to her.<br>
<br>When John, duke of Northumberland, imprisoned Somerset for the second time in October 1551 Anne was incarcerated in the Tower, where John Hooper, bishop of Gloucester, visited her. Somerset was executed in 1552 but Anne, though protestant, remained on good terms with Queen Mary, who freed her on 10 August 1553 and granted her Hanworth, Middlesex, in March 1558. Later that year she married her late husband's steward, Francis Newdegate (1519&#150;1582), fifth son of John Newdegate of Harefield, Middlesex, and Anne, daughter of Nicholas Hilton of Cambridge. In 1561, after learning of the secret marriage of Anne's son Edward, then earl of Hertford, and Katherine Grey, a royal claimant, Elizabeth imprisoned them; though Anne denounced their actions she obtained custody of Hertford in 1563&#150;4 and later repeatedly requested his and his wife's freedom. In 1564 the crown questioned Newdegate, a parliamentary member, about his support for Katherine's succession claims. Ultimately both sons of the marriage of Edward and Katherine were placed in Anne's care.<br>
<br>At his death in January 1582 Newdegate bequeathed his entire estate to Anne. In her will, dated 14 July 1586, she left bequests to four of her children: Hertford, whom she favoured as her sole executor; Henry, husband of Joan Percy, daughter of the seventh earl of Northumberland; Mary, wife of Andrew Rogers of Dorset and later of Sir Henry Peyton; and Elizabeth, second wife of Sir Richard Knightly of Northamptonshire. She died at Hanworth Palace, Middlesex, on 16 April 1587 and was buried at Westminster Abbey.<br>
