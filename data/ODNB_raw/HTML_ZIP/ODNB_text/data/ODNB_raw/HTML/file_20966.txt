<span class="headword">Overbury, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1581, <em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">courtier and author</span>, was born at the manor house in Compton Scorfen (Compton Scorpion), near Ilmington, Warwickshire, and baptized on 18 June 1581 at Barton on the Heath. He was the third of the ten children of Sir Nicholas Overbury (<i>c</i>.1549&#150;1643), judge and MP, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1565&#150;1617), daughter of Giles Palmer of Compton Scorfen and his wife, Muriella.<h2>
<a name="Educationandrisetoprominence"></a>Education and rise to prominence</h2>The Overbury family had not been substantial landowners until Nicholas Overbury in 1598 bought the manor of Bourton on the Hill from John Palmer, to whom he was already related by marriage. However, the family finances made it possible for Thomas Overbury to go up as a gentleman commoner to Queen's College, Oxford, in 1595. In 1598 he entered the Middle Temple, London, his father's inn. There he became a friend of John Manningham, who recorded some of Overbury's sayings in his diary: some were witticisms, but also included were such remarks as: &#145;He would not have the bishops to have anie temporalities, or temporall jurisdicion, but live upon tithes, and nothing but preach&#146; and &#145;Sir Rob. Cecile followed the E of Ess[ex's] death not with a good mynde&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>, 236). The combination of verbal creativity, moderate puritanism, and a degree of sympathy for the second earl of Essex adumbrate later achievements and attitudes of Overbury's. So does the first reference to him in print, in a highly complimentary epigram in the <span class="italic">Affaniae</span> (1601) of his Oxford contemporary Charles Fitz-Geffrey, a collection in which many of the other epigrams are addressed either to wits or to godly protestants. Fitz-Geffrey was not Overbury's only literary friend: Overbury knew Ben Jonson well enough to gossip about him to Manningham as early as 1603, and Jonson later wrote an epigram complimenting Overbury on raising the moral tone of the court. They subsequently became enemies; Jonson claimed many years later and somewhat implausibly, in conversation with Drummond of Hawthornden, that this was because Overbury had tried to use him as a go-between in an attempted adulterous relationship with the countess of Rutland  (<span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, 1.138).<br>
<br>During Overbury's time at the Middle Temple, in his father's words:<blockquote>hee and John Guilby, his father's chiefe clerke, were sent (upon a voyage of pleasure) to Edinburgh, with 60 li between them. There Thom: met with Sir Wm. Cornwallis, one who knew him in Queene's colledge at Oxford. Sir Wm. commended him to diverse, &amp; among the rest to Robin Carr, then page to the earle of Dunbarre: so they two came along to England together, &amp; were great friends. (Oldisworth, fol. 92<i>v</i>)</blockquote>This journey was made around 1601, and thereafter Overbury returned to the Middle Temple for at least two years. A letter of Overbury's to Carr in 1613 refers to their &#145;love&#146; as of nine years' standing  (<span class="italic">Memorials of Affairs of State</span>, 3.479), which suggests that after their first meeting in Edinburgh their friendship was renewed and became more intimate in 1604, presumably on Carr's arrival in England. When his friend came to the personal notice of the king, Overbury benefited. In 1606 he received a gift of silver from the king of Denmark on a visit of the latter to the English court; on 29 September 1607 he was given a lease on a saltworks in Worcestershire which had come into the king's hands after the attainder of Robert Winter; and on 19 June 1608 he was knighted.<h2>
<a name="ProsperityandrelationshipwithRobertCarr"></a>Prosperity, and relationship with Robert Carr</h2>Overbury's relationship with Robert Carr (subsequently Viscount Rochester and earl of Somerset) was the most significant of his life. It has often been seen, perhaps simplistically, as one in which Carr depended on Overbury's superior intelligence. Certainly Carr, as the king's favourite, had a great deal of business to transact, and he needed to delegate some of it. Once Carr had become the king's unofficial secretary, incoming letters of state were routinely read and abstracted by Overbury, and outgoing dispatches were apparently drafted by him. Overbury was helpful in other ways: he could deal with Carr's suitors; he could handle business with which Carr and the king did not want to be openly associated; he could help acquire works of art for Carr's collection. He was both Carr's personal assistant and his bosom friend: in Sir Roger Wilbraham's description, his &#145;bedfellow, minion, and inward councillor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span> in <span class="italic">Camden Miscellany</span>, 10.116). What matters in this description is its emphasis on intimacy. The relationship may or may not have included sex; it was certainly emotionally charged. Carr's relationship with other associates such as Sir Robert Killigrew did not carry the same charge.<br>
<br>Being the favourite of the king's favourite brought Overbury his knighthood; it also brought him influence. According to Nicholas Overbury:<blockquote>[Francis Bacon] used &hellip; to stoope &amp; crouch to Sir Tho: Overbury, in hope of Somerset's favour to bee Master of the court of wards: for which place, hee offered much; and Sir Thomas his father might once have had 1000 li. if he would have spoken effectually to his sonne. (Oldisworth, fol. 93<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Overbury was granted the reversion of the treasurership of the chamber, a position valued in 1613 at &pound;2000. His family also received benefits: at the end of 1609, his brothers Giles and Walter were given a life grant of the office of registering assurances on ships or goods in the royal exchange.<br>
<br>Overbury was not, however, interested simply in office and patronage. Hugh Broughton claimed to have heard from him that the king would give &pound;500 per year to fund the exposition of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Hebrew and on Talmudic principles  (<span class="italic">Petition to the King to Hasten Allowance for Ebrew Institution of Ebrewes</span>, 1610?, 1v). James is not very likely to have made this promise; what is likelier is that Overbury had made an encouraging response when Broughton mentioned the project to him. It should have appealed to a man of the godly sympathies recorded by Manningham. These were of a piece with Overbury's political opposition to the pro-Spanish international interests of the Howard family. In 1613 Viscount Fenton wrote:<blockquote>all theis that Overberrye drew to him and about my Lord of Rotchester are lyke to make a pairtye to [i.e. opposed to] the Howards &hellip; Southehamptoun and Pembrouke are joyned in that syde, and thaye stand mutche to have Nevell Secreterrye. Thaye have vith them sume of the moste discontented nobill men of the younger sort, and all the Parlement mutineers. (<span class="italic">Mar and Kellie MSS</span>, 51)</blockquote>Overbury's alliance with men like Sir Henry Neville and the earl of Southampton placed him in a group self-identified as patriotic and protestant, several of whom had been at least marginally involved in the Essex rebellion.<br>
<br>Overbury was not an entirely satisfactory ally, on account of his arrogance. This was commented on by many contemporaries, one of whom subsequently remarked that it was &#145;a great question who was the proudest, Sir Walter [Ralegh], or Sir Thomas Overbury, but the difference that was, was judged on Sir Thomas' side&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 2.182). In May of 1611:<blockquote>Rochester and his dear Overbury, walking in the garden at Greenwich whither the queen's window openeth, she broke into a sudden and contemptible laughing at them. &#145;So&#146;, saith she, &#145;they did at her&#146;, which belief carried her so far that she went to the king with tears in her eyes and complained. (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 3.83)</blockquote>This account suggests that the quarrel may have been partly of the queen's making, but Overbury had overstepped the mark by laughing at her, and he was banished from court until November. On this occasion his own conceited self-confidence led him into a battle with a person stronger than himself, which damaged his political influence.<h2>
<a name="Imprisonmentanddeath"></a>Imprisonment and death</h2>The intimacy between Robert Carr and Frances Howard, then countess of Essex, had at first been abetted by Overbury, who was to claim to Carr that &#145;you fell in love with that woman, as soone as you had wonne her by my letters&#146;  (BL, MS Cotton Titus B.vii, fol. 483<i>v</i>). As it progressed, and especially as it became apparent that there was a possibility of a nullification of Frances Howard's marriage to the earl of Essex which would leave her free to marry Carr, Overbury became opposed to the relationship. Any marriage would expose his patron to influence other than his own, and an alliance with the Howards would expose him to an influence which Overbury had always detested. He made his feelings on the subject clear. A number of people now wanted to see Overbury moved away from court. The queen had never been fully reconciled to him since the quarrel of 1611. The king was aware of him as a troublemaker. Carr and Frances Howard both found Overbury standing in the way of their relationship. Overbury's enmity to the Howards was well known, and Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, was particularly interested in an alliance with Carr, to be cemented by his marriage to Howard's great-niece Frances. So, Overbury was offered an ambassadorship, which would have been a nominal promotion for him but which would have broken his daily personal influence in Carr's life. It is not certain where the post would have been; contemporary rumour suggested Paris, Brussels, or Moscow. He refused it, however, even when it had been made clear to him that the king wanted him to accept. He did this with Carr's encouragement, and Carr knew what the result would be. In the afternoon of 21 April 1613, Overbury evidently supposed that he had won the argument, remarking, as he discussed his future prospects with Sir Henry Wotton, that they had never looked better. That evening he was arrested, and taken to the Tower of London, &#145;Forasmuch,&#146; in the words of the warrant for his imprisonment, &#145;as his Ma<sup>tie</sup> hath conceaved a greate displeasure against [him] for a matter of high contempt&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/72/119).<br>
<br>Overbury remained in the Tower for more than four months. He was kept a close prisoner, permitted no communication with the outside world; when Sir Robert Killigrew, returning from a visit to Sir Walter Ralegh, spoke briefly through a window to Overbury, he was himself imprisoned briefly. The object of the imprisonment was clearly to keep Overbury well out of the way while the Essex marriage was annulled and the Carr&#150;Howard marriage was arranged. Overbury threatened, in a letter written to Carr from the Tower, that he would disclose &#145;the story betwixt you and me from the first hour to this day&#146;, so that &#145;whether I die or live, your shame shall never die&#146;  (BL, MS Cotton Titus B.vii, fol. 483<i>v</i>); but while he was a close prisoner, he could not be as damagingly indiscreet as he threatened here. It was not in any powerful person's interests to agitate for his release, nor in the king's to order it. Overbury hoped in vain that Carr would help him. By 4 June a correspondent of William Trumbull remarked that &#145;[n]ot a man enquires after him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Downshire MSS</span>, 4.125).<br>
<br>Even before his imprisonment Overbury had experienced some illness, and he had mentioned this as an excuse for refusing an ambassadorship (the reply had been, prophetically, that a foreign posting might actually be rather good for his health). By the middle of May he was described by Henry Wotton as &#145;much damaged in his health by close imprisonment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, 2.23). He became feverish, and could not eat; he suffered nausea and vomiting; he was permanently thirsty; and his urine smelt unusually foul. Wotton's assumption that Overbury's uncertain health had been worsened by imprisonment is certainly plausible. The decline may, moreover, have been accelerated by any or all of three factors. First, Overbury was dosing himself with emetics, apparently concocted by Killigrew and sent him by Carr. Second, he was receiving professional medical treatment from Theodore Turquet de Mayerne and others, which may have led to iatrogenic illness; it has been suggested that the painful, stinking ulcer present on Overbury's back in his last days may have been the gangrenous result of an incision made under Mayerne's direction to drain harmful humours from the body. Third, Frances Howard was probably making attempts, the likelihood of which will be discussed below, to have him poisoned. Overbury died in the Tower, unattended, after prolonged physical and mental suffering, early on 15 September 1613. He was buried that evening in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, the haste of his interment being explained by the foulness of his corpse.<br>
<br>Two years later it was rumoured that Overbury had been poisoned. The evidence is problematic, because it largely consists of confessions made under fear of torture or as part of a series of show trials. The case for the prosecution was that Frances Howard had been anxious to have Overbury murdered, and had even tried to bribe Sir David Wood, a servant of the queen who had been angered by Overbury's handling of some patronage business, to assassinate him before his imprisonment. Thereafter she had allegedly had Sir Gervase Elwes substituted for Sir William Waad as lieutenant of the Tower of London in May 1613 so that her agents would have easier access to Overbury; she had allegedly employed her dependants Richard Weston, Anne Turner, and James Franklin to obtain poisons and introduce them into food sent to Overbury; and, after Overbury proved resistant to these poisons, she had allegedly instructed Weston to commission an apothecary's boy to give Overbury a fatally toxic enema. The plot seems pointlessly elaborate: for instance, Franklin confessed to having obtained seven different poisons, &#145;that is to say, aqua fortis, Mercury water, white arsenick, pouder of diamonds, lapis Cosmatis, great spiders and Cantarides&#146; for Frances Howard  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/83/38). As Edward Coke handled it in the trials, the elaboration developed, and he hinted at a widespread conspiracy to poison, of which Henry, prince of Wales, had been one victim and Overbury another.<br>
<br>The likeliest reading of the evidence is that Frances Howard probably did attempt to incapacitate Overbury by poison, though not necessarily to kill him, still less to employ five different persons to subject him to repeated large doses of a variety of poisons. Robert Carr probably did not know of this until after the fact, and Overbury's death cannot be ascribed with any certainty to poison. Be that as it may, Elwes, Weston, Turner, and Franklin were all executed for it, and Carr and Howard (the earl and countess of Somerset as they had then become) were spared execution but imprisoned and disgraced. Sir Nicholas Overbury believed of the earl of Northampton that he:<blockquote>knew, there was nothing to bee gotten of the king without the helpe of Somerset; and therfore hee flattered Somerset, and plotted the poysoning of Overbury. Hee had doubtlesse suffered, if hee had not dyed betweene the Murther &amp; the Discovery of it. (Oldisworth, fol. 93<i>v</i>)</blockquote>The murder trials certainly brought down the promising Carr&#150;Howard alliance for which Northampton had worked hard.<h2>
<a name="Genuineandapocryphalwritings"></a>Genuine and apocryphal writings</h2>The only poem which can certainly be ascribed to Overbury is &#145;A Wife&#146;, comprising forty-seven verses in the same metre as Shakespeare's &#145;Venus and Adonis&#146;. It discusses the origins and benefits of marriage, and the qualities of the ideal wife, with particular regard to her usefulness and subservience to her husband. John Owen praised it in an epigram published before November 1612, which was to be translated by Joshua Sylvester. Jonson's complimentary poem to Carr on the occasion of his marriage expresses the hope that Carr's wife would &#145;Out-bee that <i>Wife</i>, in worth, thy freind did make&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ben Jonson</span>, 8.384). Sir Nicholas Overbury's claim that his son's poem was written to persuade Carr to choose a better wife than Frances Howard is at once made doubtful by this reference of Jonson's, and is unlikely on other grounds too: &#145;A Wife&#146; is expressed in very general terms, and its tone is reflective rather than didactic. The poem was not printed in Overbury's lifetime. It was, however, circulated in manuscript, and a copy came into the hands of the publisher Lawrence Lisle late in 1613. Lisle published it as an anonymous duodecimo early in the next year. It sold well enough to justify a second edition, published as <span class="italic">A wife now the widdow of Sir Thomas Overburye &hellip; whereunto are added many witty characters &hellip; written by himselfe and other learned gentlemen his friends</span>. The so-called &#145;characters&#146; were short prose descriptions of imaginary persons, imitating Joseph Hall's <span class="italic">Characters of Virtues and Vices</span> of 1608.<br>
<br>The prose descriptions were not by Overbury. The first three, one of which describes a good woman and the other two bad women, had a limited manuscript circulation as an appendix to &#145;A Wife&#146;; in one of the manuscripts, their anonymous author claims that his purpose was to make Overbury's material more intelligible. Lisle evidently obtained a manuscript of the poem in which these characters were present, and commissioned more, from one or more unknown authors, passing them off disingenuously as by Overbury and his learned friends. The collection was a great success, and Lisle issued a series of progressively augmented editions. In 1615, as the murder trials began, new editions of the collection contained topical poems on the alleged poisoning by William Browne, Richard Corbett, and others. By 1622 an eleventh edition had appeared, with eighty-two characters occupying most of its pages. Some of these were by John Webster; others have been ascribed, less certainly, to Thomas Dekker and John Ford; and one of them was later printed with the juvenilia of John Donne, though it is not very likely to be his.<br>
<br>A number of other works have been ascribed to Overbury, none with certainty. The first of these, a report of the arraignment of Sir Walter Ralegh in 1603, was published as Overbury's in 1648. It is perfectly possible that in 1603 Overbury, with his background in the inns of court, witnessed the arraignment and took notes upon it which eventually came to a publisher's hands, and it is equally possible that his name was added as a publisher's ploy to a report made by an anonymous or unimportant writer. In 1609 Overbury travelled on the continent, and the unspectacular <span class="italic">Observations in his Travailes &hellip; in 1609</span>, of which at least twelve manuscript copies are extant, appear to be notes of his on the Low Countries and France made at that time. Lisle entered the work in the Stationers' Register in 1616, but it was not published until 1626. Anthony Wood noted that &#145;[t]his goes under his name, but doubted by some, whether he wrote it&#146;  (Wood, 2.135). A translation of Ovid's <span class="italic">Remedium amoris</span> is associated with &#145;A Wife&#146; in some manuscripts, and was published as by Overbury in 1620. Finally, a collection of the table talk of King James, identified in manuscript as &#145;Crumms fal'n from King James's table &hellip; taken by S<sup>r</sup>. Thomas Overbury&#146;  (BL, MS Harleian 7582, fol. 42) cannot, on internal evidence, be earlier than 1622.<h2>
<a name="Historiography"></a>Historiography</h2>Interest in Overbury was particularly vigorous at two points in the seventeenth century: the years 1615&#150;16, and the early 1650s. The most substantial writings from the earlier period are manuscript reports of the murder trials, which are sometimes associated with reports of the Essex annulment case. A great number of short pieces, mostly in verse, were circulated in manuscript at the same time; these tended to vilify Frances Howard and, to a lesser extent, Robert Carr. Some more or less ephemeral printed texts also circulated, such as the anonymous <span class="italic">The Bloody Downfall of Adultery, Murder, Ambition</span>, the poem <span class="italic">Sir T. Overburies Vision</span>, by Richard Niccols, and the broadside poem <span class="italic">The Poysoned Knights Complaint</span>, by Samuel Rowlands. John Ford's &#145;Sir Thomas Overburyes Ghost&#146;, entered by Lisle in the Stationers' Register in 1615, is no longer extant. One or two accounts of the trials were published in Dutch. Prints of Weston, Elwes, the Somersets, and Overbury himself were also sold at the time. Those of Overbury depict a man with a long, thin face and large, dark, slightly sunken eyes. His features are regular, but he is not strikingly handsome. He has bushy and slightly receding hair, and a closely trimmed beard and moustache. In one image, by Renold Elstrack, he wears a thoughtful, melancholy expression, and is writing a poem on his own death.<br>
<br>Writings on Overbury from the period just after the execution of Charles I either present his death as an example of the depravity of the Stuart court, or answer such representations. In the first category, which tends to set Overbury up as a martyr to the evil schemes of Frances Howard, are the accounts of Sir Anthony Weldon, Arthur Wilson, Francis Osborne, and Sir Edward Peyton; in the second are those of Sir William Sanderson and Godfrey Goodman. Since the seventeenth century Overbury has generally been seen as the sad poet of Elstrack's print, betrayed by his friend, victim of the deadly designs of a corrupt monarch (according to Andrew Amos and Edward Rimbault) or of a beautiful murderess. Several semi-popular books have treated his death as a sensational murder story. He has, as the supposed author of the &#145;characters&#146; printed with &#145;A Wife&#146;, been overestimated as a prose writer, and even praised for his wide knowledge of human nature. The latter judgement is almost the reverse of the truth: Overbury's friendship with Carr might have been the foundation for a career at least as comfortable as Sir Robert Killigrew's, but his arrogance and indiscretion in dealing with other people led eventually to his imprisonment and death. John Chamberlain wrote, when he heard that Overbury had died, that &#145;he was a very unfortunat man, for nobody almost pities him, and his very frends speake but indifferently of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, ed. N. E. McClure, 1939, 1.478).<h2>
<a name="SirThomasOverburytheyounger"></a>Sir Thomas Overbury the younger</h2>His nephew <a name="cosubject_20967"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas Overbury</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1627, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">landowner and author</span>, was the eldest of the eight children of Sir Giles Overbury (1590&#150;1653), landowner, who was a brother of Sir Thomas Overbury the courtier, and his wife, Anne (1603&#150;1660), daughter of Sir John Shirley of Ifield, Sussex. Thomas Overbury inherited the manors of Bruton and Bourton on the Hill on his father's death. He and his wife, Hester Leach (<i>d</i>. 1686), had one daughter, Mary, who married William Whitelocke, a son of Bulstrode Whitelocke. In 1659 Overbury was suspected of collecting weapons to furnish a rising to restore the Stuart monarchy; in 1660 he was knighted. In 1676 his account of a supposed murder in his part of the country was published. This described the disappearance of William Harrison, steward to Viscountess Campden, in 1660; the claim by Harrison's servant John Perry that he, his mother, and his brother had conspired to murder Harrison; and the execution of all three Perrys. It then printed the claim made by Harrison on his reappearance that he had been kidnapped, taken to the coast, and put on board a ship which was then captured by Turks, by whom he was enslaved for a while, until on his master's death he returned to England. The story is, as Overbury pointed out, a puzzling one, and the book ran to three editions.<br>
<br>In 1671 Overbury wrote a brief argument for liberty of worship, &#145;Queries proposed to the serious consideration of those who &hellip; persecute &hellip; upon the account of religion&#146;, which was circulated locally in manuscript and was attacked in print by Overbury's near neighbour George Vernon of Bourton on the Water in 1677. Overbury replied to Vernon, also in print, in <span class="italic">Ratiocinium vernaculum</span> in 1678. Anthony Wood remembered him as &#145;a favourer of Protestant dissenters&#146;  (Wood, 2.136). Another locally circulated tract of Overbury's, on the prospects for a new parliament, was denounced to the king as a &#145;scurvy libel&#146; in 1676  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1659&#150;84</i>, 18.56). In 1679 he sold the manor of Bruton to Lord Brooke, and in 1680 he sold that of Bourton on the Hill for &pound;3050 to Alexander Popham, the son-in-law of Sir Edward Harley, who helped with the purchase. Overbury died at Admington, near Quinton, Gloucestershire (now part of Warwickshire), on 28 February 1684, and was buried at Quinton on 6 March.<br>
