<span class="headword">Wimund</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1130&#150;<em>c.</em>1150), <span class="occ">bishop of the Isles and pretender</span>, is unquestionably one of the most enigmatic figures of twelfth-century Scottish history. His story is related in its fullest form by the English chronicler William of Newburgh, who claims to have spoken personally with him. According to William, Wimund was born in England and educated as a clerk. After becoming a monk at Furness Abbey, he was sent to the Isle of Man and became bishop of the Isles. It was now that he announced himself to be the son of the earl of Moray, &#145;despoiled by the king of Scots of the patrimony of his fathers&#146;  (William of Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia rerum Anglicarum</span>, ed. R. Howlett, Rolls Series, 1884, 74) and began waging war on the Scottish king, David I (<i>r</i>. 1124&#150;53). To Ailred of Rievaulx, Wimund was a false bishop whose lies brought some sorrow to David, a judgement at least partly confirmed by Newburgh, who records that the Scottish king was forced to cede land to Wimund which included the monastery of Furness in Lancashire. Soon, however, Wimund's arrogance caused his own subjects to capture and mutilate him. Following this he was sent to Byland Abbey in the North Riding of Yorkshire, where he is said to have boasted that &#145;had he only the eye of a sparrow his enemies should have little occasion to rejoice at what they had done to him&#146;  (Newburgh, <span class="italic">Historia</span>, 76).<br>
<br>William of Newburgh's account is devoid of specific dates for Wimund's activities, but internal references, corroborated by external sources, suggest a floruit in the 1130s and 1140s. Furness Abbey was founded in 1124 (it was moved from Tulketh to Furness in 1127), and a new bishop of the Isles was chosen between 1148 and 1152, suggesting a <i>terminus post quem</i> and a <i>terminus ante quem</i> for Wimund's activities. The origins of Wimund are problematic: William of Newburgh claimed that he was born in England, although other sources linked him with the Western Isles. He was probably buried at Byland Abbey.<br>
<br>The main questions surrounding Wimund concern his true identity and the motivation for his challenge to David I. The first question cannot be solved on the basis of the available evidence, but the support which Wimund obtained as well as his eventual fate&#151;mutilation, but not death&#151;suggest that he was not a nonentity and may have had a sound genealogical claim on his side. If this is so, he must have been related in some way to the Moray dynasty in Scotland, the last native earl of which, Angus, was killed in 1130 by David I's army at the battle of Stracathro, in Angus, after which the administration of the earldom passed to the Scottish kings. The Moray dynasty was descended from Lulach (<i>d</i>. 1058), whose stepfather, Macbeth, had been ruler of Moray before assuming the Scottish kingship (<i>r</i>. 1040&#150;57), and whose descent was traced back to the Cenel Loairn, one of the three major kindreds of Scottish D&aacute;l Riata. Despite William of Newburgh's claim that Wimund was lying in proclaiming himself to be the son of the earl of Moray, it appears likely that he was somehow connected with this dynasty, and therefore represents either a claimant to the earldom of Moray or perhaps even one to the Scottish kingship.<br>
<br>Despite the uncertainty surrounding Wimund's identity, his significance is clear. The consolidation of the descendants of Malcolm III (Malcolm Canmore) and Margaret in the Scottish kingship between 1097 and 1286, their organization into a lineage, and their territorial expansion, had the effect of displacing several localized dynasties and altering long-standing principles of succession. Both Wimund's activities and the considerable support which he obtained suggest that the expansion of the Canmore dynasty caused a good deal of resentment and even hostility. The significance of Wimund is not so much personal or genealogical, but rather what his story reveals about Scottish society in the formative era of the twelfth century.<br>
