<span class="headword">Calvert,  Albert Frederick</span>  (1872?&#150;1946), <span class="occ">traveller and author</span>, was the son of John Frederick (Fred) Calvert, a mining engineer, and his wife, Grace Easley. There is doubt about the date and place of his birth. Some sources make him Australian, born in New South Wales on 20 July 1869, a date consistent with Calvert's own claim to have written about Western Australia in 1889, when he would have been twenty, and a statement in <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> (no. 635, November 1895) that &#145;he was born in New South Wales some seven and twenty years ago&#146;. On the other hand none of the 190 laudatory fragments of reviews to ten of his books, appended to <span class="italic">My Fourth Tour in Western Australia</span> (1897), refers to him as an Australian, when they had every occasion to do so. On a birth certificate his birth was registered as having taken place at St Pancras, Kentish Town, London, on 20 July 1872. His grandfather, John Calvert (1814&#150;1897), a goldmining expert, was mainly responsible for his upbringing.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Calvert achieved eminence as an authority on Australia, on the basis of his expeditions, and the accounts he wrote of them and of other aspects of Australian life and mores. In April 1890, partly in the company of his grandfather and perhaps his father, he set out from London under the auspices of the General Exploration Company on his first gold-seeking trip to Australia. It was unsuccessful, and a second expedition, sponsored by the same body, spanned spring 1891 and summer 1892 and encompassed a route of about 500 miles into the north-west of Western Australia. Subsequently he incorporated a detour to the pearl fisheries, described in his <span class="italic">Pearls: their Origin and Formation</span> (1892). For his third &#145;tour&#146; his destination was again Roebourne, Western Australia. He set out in December 1892, on this occasion financed by the British Australian Exploration Company, inspecting mines in the goldfields. On his return to London Calvert founded the <span class="italic">Western Australian Review</span>, with the avowed intention of &#145;promoting the interests&#146; of that colony, and published <span class="italic">Western Australia: its History and Progress</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">The Exploration of Australia</span> (2 vols., 1895; 2nd edn, 1901). Simultaneously he was involved in floating mining enterprises on the stock exchange, acting as managing director for two, and as consultant for others. On 28 March 1894, in Kentish Town, he married Florence, daughter of James Holcombe, solicitor; they had five sons, one of whom, probably the eldest, was killed in action in France in 1915. Calvert was now at the apex of his business career, and was a celebrity.<br>
<br>Before undertaking his next expedition Calvert was guest at a farewell dinner given in his honour by the lord mayor of London in October 1895. His ensuing publication, <span class="italic">My Fourth Tour in Western Australia</span> (1897), listed the fellowships that he held at that time, including those of the Royal Geographical Society, the Geological Society of Edinburgh, the Scottish Geographical Society, the Geographical Society of Australia, the Royal Society of Australia, the Colonial Institute, and the Imperial Institute. The profuse illustrations, comprising photographs and sketches by the artist Walker Hodgson together with a special map of the western region, were a hallmark of his publications. In 1898 this period of prestige and prosperity came to an end when he sued for bankruptcy, claiming losses on his journal in London and the failure of certain Western Australian mining companies as the causes. His speculative investments in goldmining enterprises appear to have ceased at this time, when the whole course of his life changed.<br>
<br>For the next twenty or so years Calvert turned his attention primarily to Spain and to things Spanish. Within ten years he became such an expert on Spain that he was made a knight grand cross of the royal order of Isabel the Catholic, and made commander of the royal order of Alfonso XII. These honours superseded all others and he used them after his name on most of his publications after 1909. He was the self-styled &#145;editor&#146; of the <span class="roman">Spanish Series</span> which was to consist of nineteen volumes brought out between 1907 and 1921. They were published by John Lane at the Bodley Head, were uniformly bound in distinctive crimson cloth with gilt decoration, and were characterized by an unvarying presentation: a historical or background survey of the city or subject under discussion, followed by the plates, normally photographic and invariably exceeding by far the quantity of pages taken up by the text. At the turn of the twentieth century, and before 1903, he travelled extensively throughout the Peninsula, establishing a large number of &#145;contacts&#146; in the process. Before launching his <span class="roman">Spanish Series</span> he tested the water with <span class="italic">Impressions of Spain</span> (1903), the first of his publications on that country. This is a perceptive and informed account, with a sensitive appraisal of Spanish character, and an extensive final section on mining in the Peninsula. <span class="italic">The Alhambra</span> (1906) and its companion volume, <span class="italic">Moorish Remains in Spain</span> (1906), dedicated to Alfonso XIII, are book productions of the highest quality, embellished with an abundance of colour plates drawn from nineteenth-century works on the architectural legacy of Islam in Spain, notably by Owen Jones, to whose masterpiece on the design of the Alhambra Calvert's publications are particularly indebted. Also noteworthy are his volumes on the painters Murillo (1907), Vel&aacute;zquez, written in collaboration with C. Gasquoine Hartley (1908), and Goya (with 612 &#145;reproductions&#146;, also 1908), as well as <span class="italic">The Life of Cervantes</span> (1905). This last study is subtitled &#145;the tercentenary edition&#146; to commemorate the year of publication of the first part of <span class="italic">Don Quijote</span>, and is a spirited biography.<br>
<br>All Calvert's works on Spain were written in London, with the preface indicating his home address of Royston, Eton Avenue, Hampstead (or, occasionally, Swiss Cottage), and many are dedicated to Spanish grandees of his acquaintance, notably the marqu&eacute;s de Villalobar, minister for Spain in London. The majority of Calvert's books on Spanish topics were published before the outbreak of the First World War. Subsequently his only work on a Spanish subject appears to have been <span class="italic">The Spanish Royal Tapestries</span> (1921), the last in the series.<br>
<br>In 1902 Calvert had contributed to the controversy on the authorship of Shakespeare's works with <span class="italic">Bacon and Shakespeare</span>, an erudite coverage of the theories and an impassioned defence of Shakespeare's authorship, with appropriate illustrations, including a reproduction of the singular &#145;wheel&#146; &#145;used by Dr Owen in deciphering Sir Francis Bacon's cipher writings&#146;. That he never entirely neglected his training as a mineralogist is testified by his <span class="italic">Nigeria and its Tin Fields</span> (1910)&#151;&#145;compiled in haste, but care has been taken to verify the facts&#146;. A second edition was published in 1912, followed by the substantial <span class="italic">Nigerian Mining Manual</span> (1913). There is no evidence that he visited Nigeria nor that he ever went to Brazil, the location for his <span class="italic">Mineral Resources of Minas Geraes (Brazil)</span> (1915), for which he stated that he &#145;searched official records and read all the available literature that has been published on the subject in English, French, and Portuguese&#146;. He also consulted &#145;geologists and mining men&#146; who had been to Brazil, and clearly set great store by his sources in his quest to provide as full and up-to-date a picture as possible. He also had an interest in salt, which led to his <span class="italic">Salt in Cheshire</span> (1915), to his political study <span class="italic">A History of the Salt Union</span> (1913), and his <span class="italic">Salt and the Salt Industry</span> for Pitman's series <span class="roman">Common Commodities and Industries</span>, published after the First World War. Before 1918 he brought out five books on German African colonies, a subject he investigated in depth, and the product of political concerns at the time. A freemason since 1894 he was renowned as an authority on the history of freemasonry, some sixteen publications on the subject being attributed to him, including <span class="italic">The Grand Lodge of England, 1717&#150;1917</span> (1917). His last publication of note demonstrated another aspect of his versatility: <span class="italic">Daffodil Growing for Pleasure and Profit</span> (1929). This consists of eighteen chapters by Calvert, an equal number by sundry authors, and photographs of over two hundred classes of daffodil. The inclusion of two photographs of &#145;daffodils growing in one of R. F. Calvert's fields at Coverack, Cornwall&#146; suggests that the Calvert mentioned might have been a relation, perhaps one of his four surviving sons.<br>
<br>In 1923 Calvert was involved in a curious lawsuit in which he did not give evidence; damages of &pound;10,000 were awarded against him and in favour of a sister of the tsar of Russia who had implicated him in scheming to deprive her of the proceeds from the sale of her jewels. The tone of the proceedings suggests that he was no longer a person of note, and that his earlier reputation had not been durable. Thirty petitions of bankruptcy had been filed against him, the last in 1921, but he had never been &#145;adjudicated bankrupt&#146;. After 1929 little is known of his life. Seemingly there were no further publications, and there is some evidence that he received assistance from the masons before his death, at Archway Hospital, Islington, London, on 27 June 1946. His wife survived him. Part of his notable collection of masonic material was acquired for the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight, Cheshire, before 1926. There has been a revival of interest in Calvert's &#145;Australian&#146; years, while his substantial contribution to Hispanism is awaiting reassessment.<br>
