<span class="headword">Shorter <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sigerson]</span>,  Dora Mary</span>  (1866&#150;1918), <span class="occ">poet and journalist</span>, was born at 17 Richmond Hill, Dublin, the elder daughter of George Sigerson (1836&#150;1925), Dublin physician and scholar, and his wife, Hester, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Varian (1828&#150;1898), poet and novelist. Her sister Hester (later Piatt) also became a writer. Dora and her brother George were educated at a dame-school until the family moved to the more central location of 3 Clare Street, where the children were taught by their mother and aunt until Dora was seventeen; she then had a governess for a few years and thereafter she attended the Dublin School of Art.<br>
<br>Although her parents' marriage was unhappy, the family home became a Dublin salon where Dora met the leaders of Irish literary and political life. This period coincided with the beginning of the Irish literary revival, and she threw herself into the cultural life of Dublin, becoming a member of the Pan Celtic Society in 1888 and of the National Literary Society in 1892; she also contributed poems, reviews, and articles to Irish periodicals, and her first book, <span class="italic">Verses</span> (1893), was financed by Father Matthew Russell, editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Monthly</span>, in which most of the poems had first appeared. Soon after this the rising English journalist and journal editor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36076/', "Clement King Shorter (1857&#150;1926)")</script> met and fell in love with the beautiful Dora Sigerson; after a persistent courtship on his part they were engaged in September 1895, and married on 9 July 1896. In London she and Shorter held Wednesday dinner parties for writers, politicians, and journalists at their home in Marlborough Place, St John's Wood. She contributed poems, articles, and reviews to numerous British and Irish journals, and continued to publish volumes of verse and prose sketches at regular intervals, and a <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> was issued in 1907. Her verse was generally well received, although some critics complained about the irregularity of her metrics. She took pleasure in frequent trips to the continent with her husband, and in 1904 they bought a country cottage in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Although Dora Sigerson Shorter played a vigorous role in the intellectual and cultural life of London (she counted George Meredith and Thomas Hardy among her friends and was a founding member of the Lyceum Club), her Irish sympathies strengthened; she joined the Irish Literary Society and later the Irish National Club, and according to the Fenian Mark Ryan wrote a pamphlet to dissuade Irishmen from enlisting in the British army during the South African War. She was deeply affected by the Easter rising in 1916, and with her husband organized an unsuccessful campaign to save Roger Casement from hanging. She designed and sculpted a memorial to the events of 1916 now in Glasnevin cemetery. The poems in her <span class="italic">Love of Ireland</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">The Sad Years</span> (1918) indicate a growing despair at British conduct in Ireland, and friends, such as Katherine Tynan, believed that her anguish over the political situation there was the major factor in her physical decline and premature death. Chronically ill during the previous year, she died on 6 January 1918 at 16 Marlborough Place, and she was buried in Glasnevin graveyard, Dublin.<br>
