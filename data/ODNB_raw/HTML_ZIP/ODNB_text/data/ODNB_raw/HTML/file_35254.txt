<span class="headword">North, Sir  Dudley Burton Napier</span>  (1881&#150;1961), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Great Yarmouth on 25 November 1881, the fourth of the five sons of Colonel Roger North of the Royal Artillery and adjutant in the 1st Norfolk artillery volunteers, and his wife, Fanny Ellen, the daughter of Stephen Beeching, of Tunbridge Wells. He entered the <i>Britannia</i> as a naval cadet in 1896 and then served in cruisers, destroyers, and battleships as a midshipman. He became sub-lieutenant in 1902 and lieutenant in 1903.<br>
<br>In the battle cruiser <i>New Zealand</i> North took part in the battle of Heligoland (1914). As commander, and in the same vessel, from 31 December 1914 he took part in the battles of the Dogger Bank (1915) and Jutland (1916). After a short period of shore service in the Admiralty, where he was naval assistant to Captain Lionel Halsey, he returned to sea in the battle cruiser <i>Australia</i>. Promoted captain and appointed CMG in 1919, he embarked on a series of world tours by various members of the royal family as naval equerry. In 1919 he was also appointed MVO, in 1920 CVO, and in 1922 CSI. In 1922&#150;4 he commanded C class cruisers before taking another royal tour with the prince of Wales in 1925.<br>
<br>North was then successful in various important posts as captain, being flag captain in the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet in 1926&#150;7, and subsequently flag captain and chief of staff in the Reserve Fleet. In 1930 he became director of operations at the Admiralty, being promoted to rear-admiral in 1932. He then became chief of staff to Admiral Sir John Kelly, the commander-in-chief, Home Fleet. There his tact and courtesy combined well with the unconventional attitude of Kelly, who was determined to make the fleet forget the Invergordon rising of 1931. In 1934 North was appointed to the command of the royal yachts at Portsmouth, a post for which he was well qualified after his experiences as equerry and his friendship with the royal family, whom he accompanied to Canada in 1939. When war came in September 1939, North, CB since 1935, a vice-admiral since 1936, and KCVO since 1937, had been too long out of touch with the fleet to be appointed to a sea-going command. Instead, he was made flag officer commanding the north Atlantic station and admiral superintendent at Gibraltar, taking up his post in November 1939. He was promoted to admiral in May 1940. The bombardment of Oran, by the British fleet under Admiral Sir James Somerville on 3 July 1940, distressed him considerably. He wrote an official letter to the Admiralty in which he criticized the operation and explained how repugnant it had been to all who took part. The letter was ill-received and the first lord, A. V. Alexander proposed that he should be relieved, but Sir Dudley Pound, the first sea lord, did not agree that the case was strong enough, whereupon a sharp reprimand was sent instead. This was the start of a lack of confidence in North by the Admiralty which was to have serious consequences.<br>
<br>In September 1940 occurred the incident of the French squadron passing the Strait of Gibraltar and steaming on to Dakar where it played a part in repelling the attack of the Franco-British force, an operation of which North was aware unofficially. He had received previous intelligence reports of the French movements, but expected instructions from the Admiralty which were not sent, owing to mistakes in the handling of signals. In the event, he took no action to stop the French and this was regarded by the Admiralty as an unforgivable lack of initiative. The first sea lord proposed, and the first lord agreed, that he should be relieved, and this was done on 31 December 1940, despite North's violent protests and demands for an inquiry. On arrival in London in mid-January, North saw Pound, the first sea lord, but the interview, and subsequent letters, achieved no inquiry. North joined the Home Guard and in 1942 was appointed flag officer, Yarmouth, as a retired rear-admiral.<br>
<br>In appearance North was of medium height and stocky, with a cheerful round face which usually had a twinkle. He married, in 1909, Eglantine, daughter of William R. Campbell of Sydney, New South Wales. She died in 1917 and he married, in 1923, Eilean Flora, daughter of Edward Graham JP of Charminster, Dorset. There were a son and three daughters of the second marriage.<br>
<br>After the war North was still convinced that he had been treated unjustly, and so apparently was George VI, who appointed him admiral commanding royal yachts, a post which lasted a year only because economies were made. North became GCVO in 1947. The post-war years saw a succession of efforts, some by North personally, some by others, to secure an inquiry. The Admiralty was criticized in several books and articles and North again wrote to Whitehall. In 1953 five admirals of the fleet took up the case with the first lord, J. P. L. Thomas, but without result. In 1954 the publication of the official history appeared to clear North, and a bitter argument took place in the House of Commons, in which the first lord emphasized the loss of confidence in North by the Admiralty board and refused to act. A fiery debate also took place in the House of Lords. Whereas it cannot be disputed that the Admiralty could relieve any officer in whom confidence had been lost, the method used was clumsy and the subsequent handling bungled.<br>
<br>When Lord Mountbatten of Burma, who had been a friend of North's for many years, became first sea lord in 1955, he at once investigated the affair and came to the conclusion that an inquiry would serve no purpose. However, in 1957 the publication of a book by Noel Monks, strongly criticizing the Admiralty, revived the matter yet again, and another debate took place in the Commons. Mountbatten, Lord Selkirk, the new first lord, and Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, spent many hours considering the documents and also met the five admirals of the fleet. The prime minister then produced a carefully balanced statement in which he stressed that North's honour and professional integrity had not been impugned but refused an inquiry into such a well-documented incident. The public generally were satisfied that the statement ended the affair with a vindication of North's honour. North himself was not so content. He died on 15 May 1961 at Herrison House, Dorchester, Dorset, a sad and bitter man. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
