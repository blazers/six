<span class="headword">Vogt,  Marthe Louise</span>  (1903&#150;2003), <span class="occ">pharmacologist and neurochemist</span>, was born on 8 September 1903 in Berlin, Germany, the elder daughter of Oskar Vogt (1870&#150;1959) and his wife, C&eacute;cile, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mugnier (1875&#150;1962), both neurologists. Oskar Vogt came from a Lutheran family in Schleswig-Holstein and C&eacute;cile from Savoie. They had met in Paris where both were undertaking neuroanatomical research. In 1899 they moved to Berlin and, using income from their private practices, founded a small research institute. In 1930 the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut f&uuml;r Hirnforschung was created specifically for them with funds from the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft zur F&ouml;rderung der Wissenschaften and the Rockefeller Foundation. Vogt's younger sister, Marguerite (<i>b</i>. 1913), later became a distinguished geneticist.<br>
<br>Marthe Vogt was educated at the Auguste-Viktoria-Schule at Berlin-Charlottenburg and graduated in medicine and chemistry from Berlin University in 1927. Her objective was always a career in research rather than clinical practice. While an undergraduate, she considered specializing in experimental psychology, but rejected it because of the lack of disciplinary focus. On qualifying she undertook an MD with her father, then completed a PhD in biochemistry before joining Paul Trendelenburg in Berlin University's department of pharmacology in October 1929. In December 1930 she became a research assistant in her parents' new institute and the next year, at the age of twenty-eight, she was appointed head of the division of chemistry.<br>
<br>The facilities were excellent and her research productive, but in April 1935 Vogt left Germany on a one-year Rockefeller travelling fellowship, with no intention of returning. She first joined Sir Henry Dale's group at the National Institute for Medical Research in London, which was at the heart of the debate as to whether communication between nerves and their target cells was mediated by chemical neurotransmitters or by electrical conduction. Within a few months Dale, Vogt, and Wilhelm Feldberg had demonstrated that nervous control of voluntary muscle is due to release of acetylcholine. This was the crowning confirmation of the chemical hypothesis, for which Dale together with Otto Loewi received the 1936 Nobel prize. Vogt spent the second half of her fellowship at Cambridge with E. B. (Basil) Verney, studying renal hypertension. When her Rockefeller support lapsed Verney found her temporary funding from the Royal Society and she then obtained a three-year fellowship from Girton College, allowing consolidation of her Cambridge research into a second PhD.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 regional tribunals were set up to assess the security risk from German nationals residing in Britain: because of its proximity to the Wash, Cambridge was of especial concern. Vogt's resignation from the Berlin institute had never been accepted and she was therefore still officially a member of the German Workers' Front and so deemed a dangerous enemy alien. Following urgent intercessions to the Home Office by Dale, Verney, and others, however, her internment order was reversed and she was reclassified as a friendly alien.<br>
<br>In 1941 J. H. (Jack) Gaddum offered Vogt a post at the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in London. This was an opportunity to establish an independent research profile at last. She spent the next six years elucidating the role of the adrenal gland in responses to stress and also began to think seriously about neurotransmitters in the brain. Initial studies were carried out on acetylcholine, again in collaboration with Feldberg. Then in 1947 she moved to Edinburgh to rejoin Gaddum, now professor of materia medica there, and she was appointed lecturer, rising to senior lecturer in 1951 and reader in 1952. From this time on, her research focused on the roles of monoamines as brain neurotransmitters.<br>
<br>While at Edinburgh Vogt published over forty papers, including her two most important. In 1954 she documented the presence of greatly varying concentrations of the catecholamine molecule, noradrenaline, in different regions of the brain. Noradrenaline was known already to be the neurotransmitter in peripheral nerves that constrict blood vessels and, although it had been found previously in the brain, this was thought to be due to the presence of blood vessels. Vogt's findings, however, indicated that the brain itself possesses noradrenaline-containing cells. Years later Vogt recalled that the work<blockquote>took about four years to carry out (1950&#150;1953) but the manuscript was accidentally buried on the editor's desk until I finally had the courage to enquire about its fate. It was then published with great speed and without editorial corrections. (<span class="italic">Current Contents</span>, 227)</blockquote>This study was the trigger for the international explosion of research that over the next twenty years elucidated the importance of catecholamine neurotransmitters in a wide variety of brain functions. It was followed in 1956 by a second definitive paper, describing (with Marguerite Holzbauer) the depletion of brain noradrenaline by reserpine. A natural plant alkaloid, reserpine was in the early 1950s the drug of choice for treating high blood pressure because it depleted noradrenaline from peripheral nerves and so relaxed blood vessels. What was not recognized was that reserpine also depleted brain catecholamines, causing mood depression that led to many suicides. Vogt's findings were later acclaimed as opening the way for development of therapeutically effective tranquillizers and antidepressants, but they were more immediately important in eliminating the high mortality associated with antihypertensive drug therapy.<br>
<br>In 1958 Gaddum moved to the Agricultural Research Council Institute at Babraham, Cambridge, and in 1960 Vogt joined him as head of the pharmacology unit. Although she retired officially in 1968, she continued her research at Babraham for another twenty years, focusing on the brain monoamines dopamine and serotonin. In this period her elucidation of the neurotransmitter role of serotonin was particularly significant, since it formed the basis for development of a new armamentarium of antidepressant drugs such as Prozac.<br>
<br>Vogt received many honours. In 1952 she was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, only the ninth woman to be so recognized. She became a life fellow of Girton College in 1970, was awarded honorary degrees by Edinburgh (1974) and Cambridge (1983) and honorary memberships of numerous medical and learned societies in Britain and abroad, and received the royal medal of the Royal Society in 1981 and the Wellcome gold medal of the British Pharmacological Society in 1983.<br>
<br>Vogt never married. When her sister Marguerite was asked why neither of them had followed their mother's example in combining science and family life, she replied &#145;Ah, my mother. She was an exception to the rule&#146;  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>, 10 April 2001). Vogt was quiet and reserved, but unfailingly kind and hospitable to the many visitors who came to work with her. She was an avid and tireless tourist with a deep interest in ancient civilizations, and during her later years became a keen gardener, with rose growing a particular passion. She had a strong interest in human rights of all sorts. When invited to be included in a &#145;who's who&#146; of women scientists she refused on the grounds that the book was sexually discriminatory. Rather typically, she added a handwritten &#145;sorry&#146; to the typed refusal. Reduced mobility eventually forced her to leave Cambridge in 1990. She moved to live with her sister in La Jolla, California, where she died on 9 September 2003, the day after her hundredth birthday.<br>
