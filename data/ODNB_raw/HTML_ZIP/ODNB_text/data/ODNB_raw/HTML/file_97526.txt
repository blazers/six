<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Drake,  Charles Edward <span class="st"> [Charlie]</span></span>  (1925&#150;2006), <span class="occ">actor and comedian</span>, was born Charles Edward Springall on 19 June 1925 at 185 Westmoreland Road, Walworth, London, the second child in the family of three sons and three daughters of William Springall, newspaper vendor, and his wife, Winifred, otherwise Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Drake. He attended Victory Place junior school and Paragon Row senior school, leaving the latter aged fourteen. Congenitally restless and fired by memories of accompanying Harry Champion singing &#145;Any old iron&#146; at the South London Palace aged eight, he was determined to succeed as an entertainer. His short stature (five feet one and a half inches), quick wits, and acrobatic ability made him a natural comic. His boyish face, wispy strawberry-blond curls, and blue eyes gave his persona an innocence belied by a truculent determination to get his own way. He enlisted in the RAF in 1943 as a wireless operator and rear gunner, finding occasional opportunities to perform. After demobilization he worked part-time at working men's clubs as a stand-up comedian, adopting his mother's maiden name.<br>
<br>After the war Drake turned professional, initially working as Dick Emery's feed touring provincial variety theatres, but his career took off after pairing with Jack Edwardes, whose height and lugubrious persona complemented Drake's whirlwind, maniacal energy. Their double act, featured on the children's magazine television programme <span class="italic">Jigsaw</span> (BBC, 1954&#150;5), blossomed in their own show on ITV, <span class="italic">Mick and Montmorency</span> (1955&#150;8). Drake's &#145;Hello, my darlins&#146; became a national catchphrase. Unwilling to be typecast as a children's entertainer he dissolved the partnership to star in several series built round his own impish persona: <span class="italic">Drake's Progress</span> (1957&#150;8), <span class="italic">Charlie Drake In &hellip;</span> (1958&#150;60), and <span class="italic">The Charlie Drake Show</span> (1960&#150;61) for the BBC. A perfectionist dedicated to the comedian's craft, Drake, who wrote or co-wrote his material, often with his long-time writing partner Lew Schwarz, gained a reputation as &#145;difficult&#146; because of his uncompromising demands in d&eacute;cor, lighting, and set design. The latter was a necessity as his shows were built round inventive and perilous slapstick set pieces&#151;&#145;The reluctant tightrope walker&#146; or &#145;The little picture hanger&#146;&#151;that required absolute exactitude. During an episode of the live television show <span class="italic">Bingo Madness</span> (1961) he was seriously injured and lay in a coma for several days. However, Drake always felt that a live show provided &#145;the edge and fear that &hellip; are essential to all of the performing arts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Drake's Progress</span>, 98).<br>
<br>After a two-year break Drake returned with what became his best-remembered series, <span class="italic">The Worker</span> (1965&#150;70), for ITV, playing a willing but accident-prone handyman who fails at every job he is given. The central scenes of mayhem were bookended by his sparring with Henry McGee's dead-pan labour exchange clerk Mr Pugh, always mispronounced as &#145;Poo&#146;. The culmination of his television career came in 1968 when a compilation of set pieces from the BBC series <span class="italic">The Charlie Drake Show</span> won the coveted golden rose at Montreux. It included the celebrated nine-minute sequence in which he conducted an orchestra performing Tchaikovsky's <span class="italic">1812 Overture</span> and played every instrument, a masterpiece of comic invention, timing, and the megalomania that characterized many of his creations.<br>
<br>Drake's cinema career&#151;he starred in four films for the Associated British Picture Corporation&#151;was less successful. <span class="italic">Sands of the Desert</span> (1960) was undistinguished, but <span class="italic">Petticoat Pirates</span> (1961) made more inventive use of the anarchic and lubricious side of his persona. The <span class="italic">Times</span> reviewer referred to him as a &#145;battered Botticelli cherub&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Dec 1961), an epithet he treasured. In <span class="italic">The Cracksman</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">Mister Ten Per Cent</span> (1967) he explored the dilemma of the artist whose integrity and yearning for acceptance is spurned by an uncomprehending and venal world.<br>
<br>Drake also enjoyed recording success with sentimental or comic songs, produced by George Martin, notably &#145;Old Mr Shadow&#146; (1960) and &#145;My Boomerang Won't Come Back&#146; (1961) and continued to perform on stage, including prestigious appearances at the London Palladium, starring in nine royal variety shows (he had missed his first invited appearance as a result of the accident while filming <span class="italic">Bingo Madness</span>). He concentrated on his stage act after 1970 but was suspended by Equity after refusing to pay a fine for employing a non-member&#151;a local housewife&#151;in a Christmas pantomime at the Bradford Alhambra (1974&#150;5). During eighteen months of inactivity he lost both income and familiarity and his return with <span class="italic">Slapstick and Old Lace</span> was undermined by the extraordinarily hot summer of 1976 when audiences plummeted. After several further lean years he faced bankruptcy in 1979, unable to support a sybaritic lifestyle that included a Surrey mansion, yacht, racehorses, sports cars, and inveterate gambling (poker and horse racing).<br>
<br>Accepting whatever work was offered in order to clear his tax debts, Drake branched out into serious acting, starring in a production of Alfred Jarry's <span class="italic">Ubu Roi</span> (1980). He played Touchstone in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> at the Ludlow festival in 1981 and gave acclaimed performances as Davies in <span class="italic">The Caretaker</span> (1983) and as the grotesque moneylender Smallweed in the BBC adaptation of <span class="italic">Bleak House</span> (1985). After playing Nagg in Beckett's <span class="italic">Endgame</span> (1992) he returned to the stage for Jim Davidson's adult pantomime <span class="italic">SINderella</span> (1994) as Baron Hardon.<br>
<br>Drake's first marriage, on 11 March 1954 to Heather Evelyn Barnes, an eighteen-year-old professional dancer (and daughter of Edward Barnes, department store manager), whom he had met on tour, produced three sons but ended in divorce in 1971. His second marriage, on 12 May 1979, to Elaine Ann Bird, another professional dancer thirty-two years his junior (and daughter of Frank George Bird, telegraphist), also ended in divorce, in 1985. Following a stroke in 1995 he stopped performing and lived at Brinsworth House, Twickenham, a retirement home for actors and performers run by the Entertainment Artistes Benevolent Fund, where he died on 23 December 2006 from bronchopneumonia and heart failure. He was survived by his three sons.<br>
<br>Drake's cultural roots were in music hall but he was one of the first generation of variety comedians for whom television provided their main audience. He was part of the long tradition of diminutive British working-class comedians who played the &#145;little man&#146;, the underdog muddling his way through all adversity. But there was a darker, harsher side to his comedy, exploring the pressures and torment that performers experience. This ambivalence made him the most distinctive, if not the best-loved, comedian of his generation.<br>
