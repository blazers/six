<span class="headword">Mattison,  Francis Charles</span>  (1860&#150;1944), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 6 May 1860 in Alnwick, Northumberland, the son of a house painter, John Mattison, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Alder. The community into which he was born was part of the estates of the duke of Northumberland, a member of the Percys, one of the great landowning families of England, who had owned Alnwick Castle since 1309. Although his family was of modest means, young Francis was born at a time when the resident duke was taking a particular interest in the welfare of the county and making great efforts to improve the conditions of the poor, and it is likely that the boy received decent basic schooling. Little is known of his upbringing, but a sound education and a good brain he must have had for he went into banking and eventually became manager of a Liverpool and Martins branch bank in Bexleyheath, Kent, an impressive achievement for the son of a house painter. In 1892 he married Annie Maude, daughter of Julius Hewett, civil engineer; they lived for several years at Blackheath, and raised at least two children.<br>
<br>In his capacity as bank manager Mattison met Andrew Pringle, a customer who was also a director of the newly formed photographic manufacturing company, Kodak Limited. The recent death of Kodak's joint managing director, George Dickman, had left a vacancy for a managerial assistant with a financial background, and Pringle asked the bank manager if he could advise; to his surprise, Mattison suggested himself. After further discussions to establish whether Mattison was serious, he was offered the post and joined Kodak in March 1899. His bank was astonished that he should desert banking for trade and promised Mattison that should he reconsider before the end of the year they would find a job for him. In his early years with Kodak there were times when Mattison regretted not taking advantage of this offer but he persevered and promotion to company secretary in 1903 extinguished any lingering doubts. Thereafter he steadily progressed. In 1909 he became deputy managing director and in May 1911 was appointed to the board as a director in place of the recently deceased Sir G. W. des Voux GCMG. In January 1920 he was appointed managing director and became chairman of the board in 1927.<br>
<br>Mattison joined Kodak during an eventful period in the company's history. Although built on products marketed by the American entrepreneur George Eastman, Kodak Limited was registered in November 1898 as a British company. In 1901, however, soon after Mattison joined, a proposal by the Treasury to tax company profits to help pay for the South African War prompted Eastman to set up the Eastman Kodak Company of New Jersey. Eastman's new company immediately acquired the stock of Kodak Limited and associated companies in Europe and America, and overall control reverted to the United States.<br>
<br>Mattison's first post at Kodak was as assistant to the deputy managing director, George Davison, a distinguished landscape photographer who had been associated with the company from its earliest days. Davison was an active left-wing socialist with a reputation for being impulsive in business and cold and impersonal with his staff. He had little in common with the conservative Mattison, a precise, dignified man whose hobby was church-bell ringing. Eastman gradually lost confidence in the controversial Davison and in 1908 replaced him with an American, Charles Gifford, a man much more to Mattison's liking. Mattison was being groomed for the future and began to carry an increasing burden of the company's business, particularly during the First World War when Gifford was often away. Gifford retired in 1919 and a year later Mattison was appointed managing director. He began to assume wider responsibilities but his health failed when he developed pernicious anaemia. Although warned by colleagues that Mattison might not recover, Eastman had great respect for his abilities and to give the invalid the opportunity to regain his health, temporarily appointed the British scientist, C. E. K. Mees, in his place. The arrangement was successful; to the surprise of many, Mattison made a complete recovery and Mees was able to return to his laboratory within a year. Working closely with Eastman, Mattison played a prominent part in promoting Kodak's fortunes in Europe. Particularly important was the take-over of Charles Path&eacute;'s film company in 1927. By the end of the 1930s Kodak dominated the European motion picture market and was winning an ever increasing share of the amateur materials and equipment market.<br>
<br>Mattison was unusual in showing little interest in the manufacturing or scientific side of Kodak's business and he is said rarely to have visited the Harrow factory unless accompanied by Eastman. Yet he played a critical role in helping to develop Kodak into a multinational concern and the foremost photographic manufacturing company in the world. By 1943, although still in post as chairman, he was a sick man and confined to a wheelchair. He resigned at the end of the year and died at his home, Bridge House, West Overcliffe Drive, Westbourne, Bournemouth, on 14 December 1944. He was survived by his wife.<br>
