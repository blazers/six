<span class="headword">Pocklington,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, matriculated as a sizar from St John's College, Cambridge, about 1595. In October 1598 he migrated to Sidney Sussex College, of which he was a scholar and from where he graduated BA early in 1599 and proceeded MA in 1603. He was ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough on 22 December 1605, but seems to have remained at Sidney Sussex as a fellow. He proceeded BD in 1610, and although presented that year to the vicarage of Babergh, Suffolk, and in 1611 to the vicarage of Brabraham, Cambridgeshire, he received a dispensation to retain his fellowship, thanks to the intervention of Lord Harrington, the bishop of Bath and Wells, and the earl of Kent.<br>
<br>In 1613 Pocklington became a fellow of Pembroke College. Here he served as chaplain to the master, Samuel Harsnett, who, as bishop of Chichester, left much college business to his chaplain and to Thomas Muriell while he attended to the affairs of his diocese. Harsnett's absenteeism and delegation to junior fellows caused much resentment within Pembroke, and as early as 1614 there were complaints to Richard Neile, the new bishop of Lincoln, that Pocklington had offended against college practice by seating himself above his seniors in chapel. Two years later, in the course of a campaign by disgruntled fellows which resulted in Harsnett's forced resignation from the mastership, Matthew Wren (not usually noted for his anti-popery) informed on a disputation in the chapel in which Pocklington was alleged to have defended the doctrine of real presence and argued for Rome as a true visible church, denouncing by implication the views of such notable clergy as Archbishop George Abbot. According to Harsnett, by some time in 1617 Pocklington cleared himself in the consistory court of the charges of popery to the satisfaction of the university and the king. However, in 1618 he resigned his fellowship.<br>
<br>In 1615 Pocklington had acquired the rectory of Waresley, Hertfordshire, and when in 1618 he was additionally presented to the rectory of Yelden, Bedfordshire, he seems to have made the latter his home. Within a few years he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1655?), whose other name is unknown. Four children&#151;Margaret, Oliver, John, and Elizabeth&#151;were baptized at Yelden between 30 August 1623 and 2 December 1627. Further preferment came to Pocklington in the form of prebends at Peterborough, where he was collated on 31 October 1623, and Lincoln, where he was installed by proxy on 9 March 1627. He is also said to have become chaplain to the bishop of Lincoln, John Williams. Williams was still acting as his patron as late as 1631, when he wrote on Pocklington's behalf to Bishop William Laud, recommending him for a royal chaplaincy. Soon afterwards, however, they appear to have fallen out, according to John Hacket because Pocklington &#145;was a tell-Tale, and made needless Complaints against his Brethren&#146;  (Hacket, 2.110), although Williams's declining influence as a patron may have provided some incentive.<br>
<br>His early brushes with Neile and Wren notwithstanding, in the 1630s Pocklington was an ardent, if idiosyncratic, advocate of the new Laudian orthodoxy. In a letter of 8 December 1634 to one of the archbishop's staff at Lambeth he protested that &#145;to do his Majesty and the Church true service in the University&#146; was the &#145;unfeigned desire of his heart&#146;; he would be &#145;industrious, faithful, and in any church employment truly zealous&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1634&#150;5</i>, 346). His sermon preached before Williams on 17 August 1635 during an episcopal visitation, published as <span class="italic">Sunday No Sabbath</span> (1636), justified royal policy as set out in the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>. Dismissing sabbatarianism as a puritan doctrine and &#145;a mysterie of iniquitie, intended against the Church&#146;  (Milton, 119), Pocklington denied the relevance of the fourth commandment to Sunday observance. On the other hand, he deplored puritan &#145;irreverence&#146; in church, which he saw as tending to keep away from services those whom he considered as the &#145;godly&#146;. In his <span class="italic">Altare Christianum, or, The Dead Vicars Plea</span> (1637) he reiterated his emphasis of twenty years earlier on a holy visible church and revealed his pronounced sacerdotalism. He stressed the apostolic continuity of the hierarchy and the sacramental role of the priesthood; the railed-in altar was a &#145;holy of holies&#146;, set apart by &#145;the presence of our saviour, whose chair of state it is upon earth&#146;  (Fielding, 104), and only ordained clergy could enter and take communion there. It was therefore consistent that, in addition to praising contemporary Catholics such as Cardinal Borromeo, Pocklington should base his arguments on sources popular with Roman polemicists, align himself with the medieval church against the forerunners of protestantism, and celebrate surviving medieval church adornment. It is significant that it was in June 1637 that he was sworn a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king.<br>
<br>It is also not surprising that Pocklington should share his thoughts frankly with Williams's erstwhile enemy Sir John Lambe, dean of the court of arches and the leading proponent in the Lincoln and Peterborough dioceses of Laud's altar policies. Writing to Lambe on 4 March 1639, Pocklington, whose negative view of puritans had been compounded by his involvement in lengthy legal disputes over church restoration and by events surrounding the bishops' wars in Scotland, thought that loyal English clergy might teach Scottish ministers and the laity of both countries a lesson in duty and obedience: &#145;how they would make the pulpits ring with invectives against Puritan rebels and traitors&#146;, for &#145;when treason and rebellion is with like zeal detested and declaimed against in Puritans, as in Papists, I still believe there is some religion and pity in that generation&#146;. He again emphasized his readiness to serve church and king, &#145;though I am not ignorant that any devotion that way has done me no good amongst some no mean ones&#146;; he sought withdrawal from &#145;that corner where my strong stirring for the Church rights makes me less acceptable with some great hands&#146; and proximity to friends such as Edward Martin, president of Queens' College, Cambridge, and dean of Ely  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1638&#150;9</i>, 535). Rewarded this time with a canonry at Windsor, Pocklington was one of the chaplains who accompanied Charles I on his journey north later that year.<br>
<br>With the advent of the Short Parliament in spring 1640, Pocklington served as procurator for the Peterborough chapter in the lower house of convocation. A letter to Lambe from York dated 14 September found him again with the king, reporting optimistically on the level of support for the royal cause and dismissively of the weak state of the Scottish army. Pocklington did not serve again as procurator in the November&#150;February session of convocation. Prosecuted on account of his two books, he was also accused of turning the communion table at Yelden altarwise and bowing towards it, and of using &#145;corporal&#146; cloths and a sacring bell during the communion. <span class="italic">The Petition and Articles or Severall Charge Exhibited in Parliament Against John Pocklington</span> (1641) attacked him as &#145;a chiefe author and ringleader in all those Innovations which have of late flowed into the Church of England&#146;. Having been found guilty, on 12 February 1641 he was deprived by the House of Lords of all his benefices and disabled from ever holding any place in the church; his books were ordered to be burnt publicly in London and in the universities. He seems to have retired to Peterborough, where on 16 September 1642 he made his will, leaving to his two sons and two daughters property in Northamptonshire and at Brington and elsewhere in Huntingdonshire. Pocklington died on 14 November and was buried on 16 November in the monks' churchyard, Peterborough Cathedral; his wife and executrix survived him. His son Oliver (<i>d</i>. 1681), who obtained an Oxford MD in 1656 and probably practised as a physician during the Commonwealth, was rector of Brington from 1663 until his death.<br>
