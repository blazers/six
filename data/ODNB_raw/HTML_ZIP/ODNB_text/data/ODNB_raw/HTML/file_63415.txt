<span class="headword">Cunningham,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1575&#150;1651), <span class="occ">naval officer in the Danish service</span>, was born at Barns, near Crail, Fife, the second son of Alexander Cunningham, laird of West Barns and Gallowside, and his wife, Christiane Wood. Cunningham's early years remain obscure. Before reaching Denmark he is supposed to have travelled throughout Europe and gained experience at sea. He was probably enlisted by the Danes for his knowledge of the Arctic waters. James VI of Scotland recommended Cunningham to his brother-in-law Christian IV (1577&#150;1648), and from 1603 Cunningham was active as a sea captain in the Danish&#150;Norwegian navy. During the next fifteen years he played an important part in the implementation of Christian's foreign policy.<br>
<br>In May 1605 Christian IV dispatched three ships, commanded by Cunningham, to re-establish links with Greenland and to recover the lost Scandinavian colonies. Cunningham returned to Copenhagen in August 1605 with valuable cartographical data and minerals. He and his men kidnapped some Greenland Inuit, whom they brought back to Denmark as samples of the native population; they were put on display in Copenhagen as exotic creatures from the far north. The expedition was regarded as a success and it has ever since been looked upon as the rediscovery of Greenland. A larger expedition, with Cunningham as captain of the <i>Lion</i>, was sent to Greenland in 1606 in the hope of finding silver ore. Cunningham and his crew were also instructed to map the coast of Greenland and investigate opportunities for trade. This expedition approached the shore of Labrador and sailed almost to the mouth of Cumberland Sound before returning to Denmark in October.<br>
<br>On 9 March 1607, in Helsing&oslash;r (Elsinore), Cunningham married a Danish woman, of whom no details are known. He married again, at Bod&oslash;gaard, Nordland, Norway, on 4 September 1625; his second wife was the widowed Danish peer, Ellen Clausdatter Hundermark (<i>d</i>. 1633). There were no children from either marriage but with his mistress, a woman from Bergen who died in 1674, Cunningham had a son, Jakob Hansen Cunningham (1619&#150;1686), and a daughter, Kirsten Hansdatter (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1699). In his capacity as commander he participated in a number of expeditions to the northern regions; their aim was to ensure Christian IV's dominion of the northern seas and to discourage pirates, buccaneers, and others from trespassing illegally on the king's seas. During the Kalmar War between Denmark&#150;Norway and Sweden (1611&#150;13) Cunningham engaged in sorties against Swedish strongholds in the Baltic Sea. Jon Olafsson, an Icelandic sailor and a rifleman who sailed with Cunningham in 1616, described him as a strange and peculiar kind of person, especially when intoxicated.<br>
<br>For his outstanding naval service in coastal waters Cunningham was granted a post as district governor of Vard&oslash;hus and Finnmark. With its unprotected eastern borders facing Russia and Sweden, Finnmark was the northernmost outpost of the dual monarchy. Here Cunningham ruled for thirty-two years, an unusually long tenure for a local official. His efforts are all the more remarkable in that his period as district governor coincided with great hardships and reports of famine among the populace. His paternalistic care for his subordinates and his true concern for them was resented by the merchants, whose complaints to the king changed nothing.<br>
<br>The rapidly expanding integration into the Danish&#150;Norwegian realm of the native Sami people led to enormous challenges to rule in Finnmark. The struggle to obtain fishing privileges in the bounteous salmon rivers at Tana and Alta was also a part of this picture. Cunningham managed these concessions and, as a result, clashed with the common laws of the Sami when he began leasing the same concessions to Danish, Dutch, and Norwegian trading companies in 1629. Legal persecutions and severe sentences were used against rebellious Sami during the 1630s. Another of Cunningham's tasks was to ensure that ships from the British Isles, the Netherlands, and other seafaring nations did not venture into the king's waters without permission in their desire to take part in the lucrative trade with north-west Russia and the northern whale fishery, which were expanding rapidly during the first half of the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Cunningham was sometimes present during the court proceedings of Finnmark's many brutal witch trials. Some fifty-two cases have been documented from his period as district governor, most of which were raised against alleged witches who were sentenced to death at the stake. Although there were suggestions that witchcraft had been used against Cunningham on one occasion and against his servants he does not appear to have been a driving force in these persecutions, and he was present at few of the trials. Cunningham died at Gerdrup, an estate in Danish Sjaelland, and was buried at Eggeslevmagle church on 9 December 1651.<br>
