<span class="headword">Fisher <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lewis]</span>,  June Rosemary</span>  (1929&#150;1995), <span class="occ">educationist and trade unionist</span>, was born on 18 September 1929 at 18 Clover Street, Chatham, Kent, the only daughter of Harry Llewellyn Jones Lewis, haulage contractor, and his wife, Florence Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brewington (1907&#150;1974). Following her mother's re-marriage in 1934, June Lewis took the surname of her stepfather, John Thomas Thorndycraft, by deed poll in 1937. She was educated at St Joseph's Convent, Chatham, from 1941 to 1948, and at the University of Bristol from 1948 to 1952, graduating with an honours degree in history in 1951 and being awarded a certificate in education in 1952. Remarkably, in view of her subsequent career, she was also chairman of the Conservative Club.<br>
<br>June Thorndycraft's direction was set in 1952 when she was appointed a history teacher at Peckham Girls' School, a pioneering London county council comprehensive in south-east London. At Peckham she was hugely influenced by the headteacher, Margaret Clark, a member of the National Union of Teachers' executive and of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Still at Peckham, she became the youngest head of history in London, and then senior mistress. For a short period (1968&#150;71) she was deputy head and acting headteacher at Acland Burghley School in Camden, north London, before returning to south-east London, where for twenty-three years she was head of Catford County School for Girls. She married, first, on 4 April 1953, (Gordon) Geoffrey Partington, professor of education. The marriage ended in divorce in 1967, and on 24 February 1968 she married Robert Samuel (Sam) Fisher (1914&#150;1992), himself a headteacher in inner London, and a leading member of the executive of the National Union of Teachers in the 1960s and 1970s. He supported her throughout the key part of her professional and trade union life. They had two sons, Matthew and John.<br>
<br>The forty-two years June Fisher spent as a teacher and headteacher in inner London schools was a period of great change in secondary education. In 1952 the school-leaving age was still only fifteen; the few comprehensive or all-ability schools were pioneering or experimental; public examinations were for an &eacute;lite few; and the position and status of women teachers was underlined by their separate and inferior pay scale. June Fisher had an influence on developments especially in these and other areas of education. She did this through her own teaching in inner London, where there was a pioneering local education authority, and as a national teacher leader. A dominant and colourful personality, she was able to use her physical presence to attract and hold attention in a school assembly, addressing a national conference, or representing teachers on television. This was accompanied by a capacity for valuing and taking an interest in every individual, whether a disadvantaged pupil, a part-time member of staff, a political opponent, a casual acquaintance met on her many travels, or a senior education official. It earned her great loyalty.<br>
<br>June Fisher's commitment to developing comprehensive education and other causes motivated her involvement beyond the classroom. The influences of her early years at Peckham led her into the Communist Party and the National Union of Teachers (NUT), where as a leading member of the broad left caucus she held office locally and nationally. A member of the national executive (1984&#150;92), she served as chair of its influential education committee. Her role within the NUT was very significant. At a time of teacher industrial disputes, when the &#145;moderate left&#146; leadership was coming under attack from the &#145;ultra left&#146;, creating divisions which could be exploited by a hostile government and a cynical national press, her headmistress and often motherly approach secured a hearing for teachers.<br>
<br>A key area of June Fisher's influence and concern related to the development of a curriculum and public examination system appropriate to a comprehensive system of education. She represented the NUT in negotiations with the government and took the chair of the Schools Council history committee. As chair of the Metropolitan Regional Examinations Board she influenced the development of the CSE (certificate of secondary education) and helped prepare the ground for the eventual adoption of a single examination at 16+, the GCSE (general certificate of secondary education). As chair of the NUT education committee, she played a key role in persuading the government to finance the implementation of the single examination system. As a member of the London University examinations council she continued to represent the teaching profession in the implementation of that system. Some of her earliest campaigning was in support of equal pay for women teachers, and throughout her life she continued to champion the equality of educational opportunity for girls both in the schools where she worked and beyond. She was also prominent within the NUT in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, participating in the Aldermaston marches of the 1960s and recalling with pride her overnight imprisonment following a demonstration at Holy Loch.<br>
<br>The high point of June Fisher's career was to be elected national president of the National Union of Teachers in 1989, by which time the Thatcher government's impact on the trade union movement had been profound and, following the 1987 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, the morale of teachers was at a very low ebb. Her presidential address, &#145;Win from within&#146;, was prescient, pointing out that educational change could be achieved only from within schools and that this challenged teachers to reassert their professionalism and values in promoting the best education for the children, without posturing or absurd opposition. Throughout her presidential year she assiduously travelled the country, encouraging teachers to adopt this approach.<br>
<br>June Fisher died at St Christopher's Hospice, Sydenham, London, on 30 November 1995 after a long fight against breast cancer, and was cremated at Beckenham on 8 December. She was survived by the two sons from her second marriage. A celebration of her life was held at Catford county school in December 1995.<br>
