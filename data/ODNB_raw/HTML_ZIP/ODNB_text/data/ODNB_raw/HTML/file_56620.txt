<span class="headword">Enderby family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1750&#150;1876), <span class="occ">whale and seal oil merchants and promoters of Antarctic exploration</span>, came to prominence in the early 1750s, when the firm of Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons is recorded as oil merchants trading from Paul's Wharf, Thames Street, in the City of London. The founder was <a name="cosubject_55265"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Enderby</span>  (1717<span class="mult">x</span>20&#150;1797)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Daniel Enderby (1681&#150;1766), tanner, of Bermondsey, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cook. Little is recorded of Samuel's early life. He married Mary Buxton, possibly related to a business acquaintance, John Buxton. They reared seven children: Charles (1753&#150;1819), Daniel (<i>b</i>. 1756), <a href="#cosubject_55267">Samuel (1756&#150;1829) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1757), Hannah (<i>b</i>. 1759), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1761), and George (<i>b</i>. 1762). As early as 2 January 1742 the elder Samuel Enderby's name appears among the freedom admissions to the Coopers' Company. By 1773 or 1774 he had become concerned with the northern whale fishery in Arctic waters. More significant was the firm's involvement with the American whalers of Massachusetts and Nantucket Island, suppliers of sperm whale oil and the spermaceti wax essential at that period for industrial and domestic use, but this lucrative trade ceased with the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 in which Enderby ships came to prominence, being those in which the famous shipment of tea rached Boston in 1777. Enderby reacted by sending whaling vessels, manned largely by experienced Nantucketers, to the newly developing southern whale fishery south of lat. 44&deg; N, where sperm whales were to be found in abundance. The confirmation by the College of Arms in 1778 of the Enderby armorial ensigns was perhaps a reflection of the family's growing prosperity and influence in the City of London and in government circles.<br>
<br>In subsequent years the elder Samuel Enderby appeared as a frequent and persuasive petitioner before the committee for trade, seeking, along with other leading merchants, an extension to the fishery limits imposed by the East India Company. These views tended to coincide with those of government, whose policy was to achieve British supremacy in the southern whale fishery. A measure of the firm's success was the rounding of Cape Horn in 1788&#150;9 by the Enderby vessel <i>Emilia</i>, the first British whaler to enter the Pacific, returning in 1790 with a highly profitable catch of oil. The colonization of New South Wales in 1788 gave the firm further opportunities to expand its business in whale and seal oil and to compete fairly with foreign competitors. By 1791 Enderby had opened an office in Port Jackson (Sydney), and his whalers were transporting convicts on their outward voyages to the whaling grounds. In his latter years he continued to lobby government for legislation beneficial to the whaling industry. As the boundaries of the fisheries expanded so did the need for more favourable premiums for British whalers, for permission to revictual in certain foreign ports, and for the freedom for the whaling crews from arbitrary impressment by the navy.<br>
<br>The elder Samuel Enderby died on 12 September 1797 and was succeeded as senior partner by the younger <a name="cosubject_55267"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Enderby</span>  (1756&#150;1829)<span class="occ"></span>, partnered by his brothers Charles and George, all three of whom were freemen of the Coopers' Company. (The younger Samuel was indentured with the company in 1771 and became a freeman on 1 April 1783.) Samuel was seemingly his father's natural successor; as early as 1783, at the time of the peace treaty concluded with the former American colonies, he had been deputed to visit Boston, Massachusetts, for the purpose of gathering information on the state of the whale fishery and to engage Nantucket whalers to serve on Enderby vessels. Under his leadership the firm continued to pursue the expansionist policies of his father, the founder. In 1802 an act of parliament permitted fishing without licence throughout the Pacific, and a whale fishery with New Zealand was established. Enderby vessels were to find themselves engaged in discovery as well as hunting. In 1806 the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands were discovered by their vessel the <i>Ocean</i>, and in 1808 Bouvet Island (Bouvet-<i>&oslash;</i>ya) was rediscovered by the <i>Swan</i> and <i>Otter</i> and rediscovered again in 1825 by the <i>Sprightly</i> and <i>Lively</i> when it was claimed for the crown.<br>
<br>Enderby died in 1829 at Crooms Hill House, Crooms Hill, Blackheath, Kent, and was survived by his widow, Mary Enderby <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goodwyn (<i>d</i>. 1846), and nine children. One of their daughters, Elizabeth (1794&#150;1873), married Lieutenant-General Henry William Gordon (1785/6&#150;1865) and became the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11029/', "Charles George Gordon RA (1833&#150;1885)")</script>, the hero of Khartoum. The firm continued to trade under the name of Enderby Bros., headed by the younger Samuel Enderby's second son, <a href="#cosubject_56620">Charles [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and partnered by two of his brothers, Henry and George. After 1832 the office was moved from Paul's Wharf, Thames Street, to 15 Great St Helen's, Bishopsgate Street, London.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_56620"></a><span class="headword">Charles Enderby</span>  (1797&#150;1876)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 21 November 1797, was admitted a freeman of the Coopers' Company on 23 November 1819. He was a founder fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and fellow of both the Royal Society and the Linnean Society. An enthusiastic promoter of trade with New Zealand, whose colonization he advocated, he also encouraged the commercial and scientific exploration of Antarctic waters. To this latter purpose he dispatched Captain John Biscoe on a voyage of discovery (1830&#150;32), which resulted in Biscoe's circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and made history with the discovery of Enderby Land and Graham Land, the latter being claimed for the crown. In 1836&#150;9 another Enderby captain, John Balleny, discovered the eponymous Antarctic islands as well as land to the east of Sabrina Coast. These voyages, though commercially unrewarding, earned Charles Enderby considerable kudos. In 1847, at the suggestion of certain London merchants, Enderby published a plan for the reinvigoration of the British whaling industry by establishing a whaling station and colony on the Auckland Islands. The Enderby brothers' grant to the islands was subsequently transferred to the British Southern Whale Fishery Company, a royal charter was secured, and Charles Enderby was appointed as lieutenant-governor. In 1849 the settlement was established and whaling commenced. Few whales were caught, however, and as governor Charles Enderby proved a failure. The company was subsequently declared bankrupt and in 1852 the colony was abandoned.<br>
<br>Commenting on this final phase of the Enderby history the historian Hugh Robert Mill wrote: &#145;There is, perhaps, no other instance of a private mercantile firm undertaking so extensive a series of voyages of discovery without much encouragement in the way of pecuniary returns&#146;  (H. R. Mill, <span class="italic">Siege of the South Pole</span>, 1905, 146). Charles Enderby died intestate on 31 August 1876, aged seventy-eight, at his sister's house, 12 Neville Terrace, West Brompton, London.<br>
