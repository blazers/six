<span class="headword">Badcock,  Samuel</span>  (1747&#150;1788), <span class="occ">theologian and writer on literature</span>, was born at South Molton, Devon, on 23 February 1747, the son of a butcher. His mother's maiden name was Plake. His parents were dissenters and he was educated at a dissenting academy at Ottery St Mary. After training for the dissenting ministry, in 1768 he settled in Wimborne, Dorset, and was ordained on 23 August 1769. After three years there, he was appointed as minister in Barnstaple, where he remained until 1778. During this period, he contributed to the <span class="italic">Theological Repository</span> and thereby came to know Joseph Priestley.<br>
<br>In July 1779 Badcock wrote to Ralph Griffiths, editor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, who had been making enquiries about him as a possible reviewer, to describe the scandal that caused him to sink &#145;to the very Gates of Death&#146; and had forced him to leave Barnstaple. Badcock explained that three years earlier he had been connected with a family &#145;in which there lived a Girl of most agreeable Person &amp; of as lewd &amp; vicious a Disposition&#146;, who had almost succeeded in her attempt to seduce him&#151;she came to his bedroom, but they were interrupted before what he called the &#145;last act&#146;. He never had anything to do with her again but when she became pregnant, after having been caught in bed with a footman, she blamed Badcock and tried to blackmail him. He confided in two friends who then spread the gossip throughout Barnstaple and his reputation was ruined. At this, he took to his bed in true eighteenth-century heroine style: &#145;for two Months my life was dubious &amp; frequently despaired of &hellip; I was reduced to a Skeleton&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. C.90, fols. 8<i>r</i>&#150;9<i>v</i>). He returned to his native town of South Molton to a congregation where he remained until 1786. His long-standing dissatisfaction with dissenting doctrine and what he described as &#145;the shackles of a dissenting Minister among a low and illiteral people&#146; led him to join the Church of England in 1786  (ibid., fol. 115<i>r</i>). He was ordained deacon and priest within the same week in 1787 by Bishop Ross, of Exeter, and within a few months he became assistant to Dr Robert Gabriel at the Octagon Chapel in Bath.<br>
<br>Most of Badcock's contributions to literature appeared in periodicals. From 1744, when he sent to the <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span> a series of articles, until his death, he published widely in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">London Review</span>, <span class="italic">General Evening Post</span>, and <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, but the most famous of his articles appeared in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>. His authorship of the reviews of over 650 works between 1779 and 1787 should not have been known in his lifetime, as Ralph Griffiths maintained a strict policy of anonymity for all his reviewers and disapproved of Badcock's hints and disclosures. Alexander Chalmers described the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> as &#145;the great scene of his literary warfare&#146;  (<span class="italic">General Biographical Dictionary</span>, 1812, 3.292) and it is clear that Badcock greatly enjoyed his part in four important controversies. He reviewed at great length Martin Madan's infamous work on polygamy, <span class="italic">Thelypthora</span> (1780), and many responses to it; a number of works relating to Ossian and Chatterton between 1781 and 1785; and he engaged in furious combat with and about Joseph Priestley in 1783 and 1784. Although Badcock had been friendly with Priestley and had published in 1780 <span class="italic">A Slight Sketch of the Controversy between Dr Priestley and his Opponents</span>, he published a harshly critical review of Priestley's <span class="italic">History of the Corruptions of Christianity</span> in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> for June 1783. This, and an article by him in the following year on Priestley's <span class="italic">Letters to Dr Horsley</span>, produced two answers from Priestley and pamphlets from J. E. Hamilton and Edward Harwood. Badcock then replied in <span class="italic">A Letter to Doctor Priestley: Occasioned by his Late Pamphlet</span>.<br>
<br>During his time in Barnstaple Badcock had become acquainted with the daughter of Samuel Wesley, master of Tiverton School and elder brother of John Wesley. The letters and anecdotes which he obtained from her were sent by him to the <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span> in 1774. A subsequent account, again based on her statements, of the Wesley family provoked a correspondence with John Wesley and was published in <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span>, and reprinted in Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span>. Several of Wesley's letters were published by Priestley in 1791 under the title of <span class="italic">Original letters by Rev. John Wesley and his friends &hellip; communicated by the late Rev. S. Badcock</span>. Badcock's <span class="italic">Sermons preached at the Octagon Chapel, Bath, for the benefit of the general infirmary, 23 Dec. 1787</span> was printed for private distribution with its full text restored.<br>
<br>Badcock's published poetry included &#145;The Hermitage: Written at Castle-Hill, the Seat of Lord Fortescue&#146;, printed in January 1782 in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> (vol. 51, 41), &#145;An Author's Address to his Book&#146;, published in both the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> (vol. 52, 192) and the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (vol. 53, 389) in 1783, and &#145;To Eliza, on her Marriage&#146;, published in 1792 in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (vol. 62, 364) and in <span class="italic">Poems, Chiefly by Gentlemen of Devon and Cornwall</span>. His last work was a sermon preached at St Peter's, Exeter, at the Lent assizes, which was published in 1795. The papers which the topographer William Chapple had collected for an improved edition of Risdon's <span class="italic">Survey of Devon</span> were given to Badcock for arrangement and revision and he considered writing a new history of that county. Several letters on this matter were printed in Richard Polwhele's <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, but the work was stopped by Badcock's death.<br>
<br>By December 1787 Badcock was in bad health and circumstances but he looked forward to a prolonged stay in London with Sir John Chichester, one of his Devon patrons, at whose house in Queen Street, Mayfair, he died on 19 May 1788.<br>
<br>After his death, his friend Dr Robert Gabriel alleged that he was the virtual author of Dr Joseph White's Bampton lectures on the effects of Christianity and Islam, for which White had paid Badcock &pound;500. A fierce war of words raged in the papers. Gabriel published <span class="italic">Facts Relating to the Rev. Dr White's Bampton Lectures</span> (1789), reprinting six letters from White to Badcock, and White rejoined with <span class="italic">A statement of Dr White's literary obligations to the late Rev. Mr Samuel Badcock and the Rev. Samuel Parr, LL.D.</span> (1790). These and other pamphlets relating to the controversy were very widely reviewed, achieving maximum exposure for both sides. White was criticized for failing to acknowledge the considerable assistance he had received, Badcock for exposing a private agreement.<br>
<br>As a reviewer, Badcock was remarkably well known during the eighteenth century. Although the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>'s obituary notice of the &#145;reverend, ingenious, and learned&#146; Badcock had printed some biographical anecdotes about him, it was after the scandal of the Bampton lectures that both biographical notices and republications of some of his poems proliferated in periodicals in 1790&#150;92. <span class="italic">The Peeper: a Collection of Essays</span> (1796) included as no. xxxiv a &#145;biographical sketch&#146; of him and reprinted two of his poems.<br>
