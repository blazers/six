<span class="headword">Dillingham,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1617&#150;1689), <span class="occ">Latin poet and anthologist</span>, was the eldest of the three sons of Thomas Dillingham (<i>d</i>. 1647), rector of Barnwell All Saints, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Dorothy. On 22 April 1636 he was admitted sizar of the puritan foundation of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he roomed with William (later Archbishop) Sancroft, who had gone up in 1633. They shared a taste for poetry, and despite differing political and religious perspectives remained close friends throughout life. Dillingham proceeded BA in 1639, was elected fellow of his college in 1642, and incepted MA in the following year. In 1646 he wrote commendatory English verses for the <span class="italic">Poems</span> of John Hall of St John's, and in 1649 was one of three fellows who bore witness to some feats of engineering carried out by Captain John Bulmer. He took the degrees of BD in 1650 and DD in 1655.<br>
<br>As a moderate presbyterian Calvinist who voluntarily subscribed the solemn league and covenant (1643), Dillingham remained untouched by the ejections carried out by Edward Montagu, second earl of Manchester. While Sancroft was deprived in 1651 for refusing the engagement, Dillingham's own acquiescence in the new order was rewarded two years later with the mastership of Emmanuel. In September 1654 he was appointed by Cromwell one of the thirty visitors of the university. Although puritanism had passed its zenith, religious observances in the college remained much as described by John Cosin in 1636; the chapel, built on a north&#150;south axis, was still unconsecrated. Dillingham's rule coincided with a decline in the numbers and social standing of entrants, though in April 1658 he supported Matthew Poole's initiative for funding students who showed a vocation for the ministry.<br>
<br>Emmanuel's position at the heart of the Cambridge Platonist movement occasioned Dillingham's d&eacute;but as an entrepreneur of letters, when he put into print Nathaniel Culverwell's <span class="italic">Spiritual Opticks</span> (1651) and <span class="italic">The Light of Nature</span> (1652). In 1653 he edited from manuscript Theodore Bathurst's Latin verse-translation of Spenser's <span class="italic">The Shepheardes Calender</span>, and in the next year wrote Latin verses on the death of the puritan controversialist Thomas Gataker. Between 1656, when he issued two of his own sermons on the biblical maxim <span class="italic">Prove all things, hold fast to that which is good</span>, and his departure from Cambridge in 1662 his name appeared as a syndic of the university press on licences for sixteen works (CUL, UA, Pr.P.4(8)). These included his own Latin translation (1656) of the Westminster assembly's confession of faith and his edition of Sir Francis Vere's military <span class="italic">Commentaries</span> (1657). He was also involved in editing Ferrarius's <span class="italic">Lexicon geographicum</span> (1657), and published John Arrowsmith's <span class="italic">Armilla catechetica</span> (1659) with his friend Thomas Horton, whose <span class="italic">Forty Six Sermons</span> and <span class="italic">Choice &hellip; Expositions on Four Select Psalms</span> he was to bring out in 1674 and 1675 respectively. Besides contributing Latin verses to the various congratulatory volumes (1659&#150;62) issued by the university, he helped to draft new regulations for its library.<br>
<br>About this time Dillingham married, and with his wife, Elizabeth, had a daughter and three sons, the eldest of whom, Thomas, was born on the eve of the Restoration, while Dillingham was serving as vice-chancellor. In this capacity he drafted a letter to Monck on his election as MP for the university in April 1660  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 1st ser., 7, 1853, 427 and 486) and introduced <span class="italic">Musarum Cantabrigiensium [SOSTRA]</span> on the king's restoration. When the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> was passed his refusal to reject his obligations to the solemn league prevented him from taking the new oath, and he automatically forfeited his posts in August 1662. To Sancroft, who was unanimously elected master in his place, he addressed a generous letter  (Waters, 2.639) from Oundle, where his brother Benjamin (<i>d</i>. 1679) was vicar. There Dillingham lived in retirement for the next ten years, amusing himself by writing verses in English and Latin which he shared with neighbours (ibid., 2.642; <span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Isham</span>, 82 n. 11 and 84 n. 19). He was briefly joined by another ejected presbyterian poet, Robert Wild, the Ferus of his poem &#145;Campanae undelenses&#146;. Following the death of Elizabeth Dillingham he was persuaded to conform, and in May 1672 was presented to the rectory of Woodhill (now Odell) in Bedfordshire, by Sir Thomas Alston, over whose wife he read the funeral sermon in September 1677 (published 1678). On 30 October 1673 he married Mary Toller (1622/3&#150;1690) at Horbling in Lincolnshire. Mary was fifty years old, three times a widow, and mother to seven children.<br>
<br>In 1678 Dillingham published <span class="italic">Poemata varii argumenti</span>, the first English anthology of neo-Latin verse. The anthology included many poems by Dillingham himself; his translations from George Herbert take up nearly a quarter of the whole. The translations of Herbert's &#145;The Church Porch&#146; and &#145;The Sacrifice&#146; had been discussed in detail with Sancroft, whose appointment as primate he had celebrated in verse  (Waters, 2.641) and who now contributed anonymously a Latin version of an epigram by Thomas Bastard (BL, Sloane MS 1710, fol. 210). Besides &#145;Campanae undelenses&#146; Dillingham's own compositions include &#145;Sphaeristerium Suleianum&#146;, inspired by the earl of Westmorland's bowling green at Sullehay Lodge, and &#145;Sepes hortensis&#146;, some lines &#145;on a garden clipt hedge&#146; that he had sent to Sir Justinian Isham of Lamport in February 1672  (<span class="italic">Diary of Thomas Isham</span>, 85). The prescriptive hexameters &#145;De moribus puerorum&#146; were written for his son Thomas, whose ownership inscription appears in a copy of the work that bears his father's autograph notes and corrections (BL, 1213.g.30). An earlier anthology entitled &#145;Wilhelmi Dillinghami poemata ab eo vel inventa, vel versa&#146; (BL, Sloane MS 1815, fols. 54&#150;61) had been abandoned, and a later one, &#145;Poemata selecta ex auctoribus qua veteribus, qua neotericis&#146;, comprising forty-six poems in manuscript or printed texts, remained unpublished (BL, Sloane MS 1766).<br>
<br>Until the year of his death Dillingham continued to consult Sancroft on various schemes for publication (BL, Sloane MS 1710, fols. 206&#150;15; Waters, 2.643&#150;7). These included an enlarged edition of Richard Parker's historical register &#145;Skeletos Cantabrigiensis&#146; (now BL, Sloane MS 1765), a &#145;collection of academical orations and epistles which I had made 30 yeares since&#146;  (listed in Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 461, fols. 1&#150;2, 174&#150;6), an ambitious compendium of Greek poets with their commentators  (Waters, 2.643&#150;4), and William Bedell's pastoral dialogue on the Gunpowder Plot, <span class="italic">A Protestant Memorial</span>. Only the last of these was published, from Dillingham's papers, in 1713. His Latin lives of Laurence Chaderton, first master of Emmanuel, and of Archbishop Usher, together with his exercises for the degrees of BD and DD, all of which survive in autograph (BL, Harley MS 7052), were published posthumously by his son Thomas at Cambridge in 1700.<br>
<br>Dillingham's last published poem, <span class="italic">Aegyptus triumphata</span> (1680), was a brief epic in hexameters on the plagues of Egypt. His version of the essay &#145;Concerning the cure of anger&#146; appeared in a collaborative translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">Morals</span> (1684, 1.48&#150;82). The British Library (Sloane MS 1818) holds an autograph manuscript of this and of <span class="italic">Protestant certainty, or, A short treatise showing how a protestant may be well assured of the articles of his faith</span> that was issued in the summer of 1689. He followed this in the autumn with <span class="italic">The Mystery of Iniquity Anatomized</span>, alleging the erosion of primitive Christianity by the Catholic church. He was buried at Odell on 28 November 1689, and his wife at Horbling on 21 June 1690. His son Thomas died in 1704 as rector of his grandfather's old parish.<br>
