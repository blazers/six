<span class="headword">Pearce,  (Ann) Philippa</span>  (1920&#150;2006), <span class="occ">children's writer</span>, was born on 23 January 1920 at Crofters, Woodlands Road, Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, the younger daughter and youngest of four children of Ernest Alexander Pearce, master flour miller and corn merchant, and his wife, Gertrude Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ramsden. Brought up in the Mill House in Great Shelford, a handsome early nineteenth-century dwelling set in the upper reaches of the River Cam, Pearce suffered so badly from the kidney disease nephritis that she started school only at the age of eight. Despite this she was still able on occasion to enjoy fishing, swimming, and skating. From the Perse Girls' School in Cambridge she won a state scholarship to read English and history at Girton College, Cambridge. Employed as a civil servant from 1942 to 1945, she then moved to the BBC to work as a producer and scriptwriter in its schools broadcasting department.<br>
<br>During a long period in hospital in 1951 recovering from another bout of nephritis Pearce helped pass the time by recreating every moment of a favourite canoe trip taken many years previously on the river next to her childhood home. These memories led to her first novel, <span class="italic">The Minnow on the Say</span> (1955). Illustrated by Edward Ardizzone, this outwardly conventional story of two boys finding lost treasure in time to save the family home was also a sensitive exploration of mood, friendship, and the power of place. It was runner-up for that year's prestigious Carnegie medal for excellence in children's literature. Her next novel, <span class="italic">Tom's Midnight Garden</span> (1958), was an instant success and soon took on classic status. Inspired by the fact that her father had decided to sell the family home before retiring, Pearce wrote a story based on the walled garden that she, her father, and her grandfather had all once enjoyed as children. She also drew on J. W. Dunne's <span class="italic">An Experiment with Time</span> (1927), and its central notion that different periods of time are able to co-exist and blend together. The story describes how Tom, a schoolboy from the modern suburbs, somehow has regular meetings with Hatty, a child orphan living in Victorian times. It won the 1959 Carnegie medal and was televised three times, turned into a play, and made into a film.<br>
<br>In 1958 Pearce moved to work in publishing, first at the Clarendon Press and then, from 1960, for Andr&eacute; Deutsch. Meanwhile she provided the text for her only picture book, <span class="italic">Mrs Cockle's Cat</span> (1961), illustrated by Antony Maitland. Her next novel, <span class="italic">A Dog So Small</span> (1962), was rejected by her preferred publisher on the grounds that it was too depressing. This was a sad misreading of a fine novel that describes how a bored and lonely child slowly discovers that living in a fantasy world provides no long-term alternative to embracing reality to the full. Finally published by Constable, it was another critical success.<br>
<br>On 9 May 1963, at Hampstead register office, Pearce married Martin James Graham Christie, a fruit farmer and researcher seven years her senior, son of James Christie, businessman. He died in 1965 just after the birth of their daughter Sally, never having recovered fully from his time as a Japanese prisoner of war. Bringing up her child single-handed, Pearce found less time for writing. But in <span class="italic">The Children of the House</span> (1968) she expertly fictionalized the poignant but tangled childhood memoirs of Major Sir Brian Fairfax-Lucy, who had been brought up in the stately home of Charlecote in conditions of severe emotional and physical neglect. This outstanding joint publication was reissued in 1989 as <span class="italic">The Children of Charlecote</span>. Pearce's next publications, <span class="italic">The Elm Street Lot</span> (1969) and <span class="italic">What the Neighbours Did</span> (1972), were both genial collections of short stories, some of which had been televised on the BBC's children's programme <span class="italic">Jackanory</span>. Returning to her previous prize-winning form, <span class="italic">The Battle of Bubble and Squeak</span> (1978), an account drawn from her own experience of a family's up-and-down adventures with a couple of lively gerbils, won the Whitbread children's book award for that year.<br>
<br>Leaving London, where she had been working as a freelance for the previous six years, Pearce moved in 1973 with her daughter to Ashton, a small cottage built by her grandfather opposite the Mill House in Great Shelford, which she had immortalized in fiction as &#145;Great Barley&#146;. Among her later books were <span class="italic">The Way to Sattin Shore</span> (1985), once again runner-up for the Carnegie medal, and <span class="italic">The Little Gentleman</span> (2004), an affectionate tale about a talking mole whom she imagined living beneath an old log visible from her window and on which she liked to sit. With her daughter Sally, by then a writer and publisher herself, and her two grandsons living next door, and with a pony, goat, dog, cat, and hens for additional company, Pearce remained a much loved figure at home and at meetings and conferences, whose audiences were always charmed by her wit, wisdom, and inherent sense of grace. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1993 and appointed OBE in 1997 for services to children's literature, she died of a stroke at the University Hospital of North Durham, in Durham, on 21 December 2006, having just addressed a meeting at Seven Stories, the centre for children's books in Newcastle upon Tyne. She was survived by her daughter.<br>
