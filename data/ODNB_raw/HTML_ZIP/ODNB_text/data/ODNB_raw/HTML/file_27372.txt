<span class="headword">Thoroton,  Thomas</span>  (1723?&#150;1794), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Robert Thoroton, of Screveton, Nottinghamshire, a landowner, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Sir Richard Levett, lord mayor of London, and widow of Abraham Blackborne, a London mercer. He was educated at Westminster School (1736&#150;42) and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (1742&#150;5), and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1745. A descendant of Thomas, the younger brother of the antiquary Robert Thoroton, he was also distantly related to John Manners, third duke of Rutland, and he lived at Belvoir Castle and Rutland House. Thoroton acted as agent to the duke in all his political and private business, and became the Rutland group's parliamentary whip or &#145;man of business&#146;. On 6 October 1751, at Knipton, Leicestershire, he married Roosita Drake (<i>b</i>. 1735), the illegitimate daughter of the duke of Rutland. They had eight sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In gratitude for the assistance rendered by the Rutland connection, the first duke of Newcastle returned Thoroton to parliament on 15 January 1757 for the borough of Boroughbridge, and on 27 March 1761 for the town of Newark. On the appointment of the duke's son, John Manners, marquess of Granby, as master-general of the ordnance on 1 July 1763, Thoroton became secretary to the board, a post which he held until 1770. Although he was regarded as one of Newcastle's Nottinghamshire friends, his loyalty was to the Rutland family, and he voted consistently with Granby. He supported the Grenville ministry, opposed the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, and supported the Chatham ministry [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95095', "Chathamites")</script>]. After a period of strained relations with Newcastle, Thoroton withdrew from Newark, and on 14 February 1769 he was returned for Bramber, Sussex, as Granby's nominee. He retained his seat until 1782. In January 1770 he followed Granby into opposition, but after Granby's death his conduct was less predictable. Although he voted against the government on the Middlesex motion on 26 April 1773, he was classified by John Robinson at the end of this parliament as a government supporter.<br>
<br>After retiring from parliament Thoroton continued to look after the interests of the Rutland family, and between 1784 and 1787, while Charles Manners, fourth duke of Rutland, was lord lieutenant of Ireland, he looked after the latter's English business. He died at his home, Screveton Hall, on 9 May 1794 and was buried in the neighbouring church of St Wilfrid's. Of his thirteen children, John became rector of Bottesford and chaplain of Belvoir Castle, and was knighted in 1814; Robert was appointed private secretary to the fourth duke of Rutland during his viceroyalty of Ireland, and clerk to the Irish parliament; and Mary in 1778 married Charles Manners-Sutton (1755&#150;1828), who became in 1805 archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
