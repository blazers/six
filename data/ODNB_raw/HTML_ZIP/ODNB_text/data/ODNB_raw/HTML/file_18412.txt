<span class="headword">Maxwell,  William, of Terregles</span>, fifth Lord Herries of Terregles  (<em>c.</em>1555&#150;1603), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was probably born at Hoddom, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18403/', "Sir John Maxwell of Terregles, later fourth Lord Herries of Terregles (c.1512&#150;1583)")</script>, and his wife, Agnes Herries (<i>c</i>.1534&#150;1594). He was the first cousin of John, eighth Lord Maxwell, head of the senior line of the family and the Maxwell surname. His father reunited and added to the established Herries estates during the 1560s, so that William eventually inherited extensive estates centred on Hoddom in Dumfriesshire. Like his father he may have received some education at Sweetheart Abbey.<br>
<br>In May 1568 William Maxwell accompanied his father to the battle of Langside which he watched with Queen Mary. He was present during Moray's suppression of the queen's followers in Dumfriesshire later that year and during the English raids of 1570. He submitted to ward to secure his father's release by the king's party on at least one occasion, but did not himself finally submit until late 1572. The attacks on Dumfriesshire, and the kirk's support for these, may have contributed to William's subsequent hostility to England, and his disaffection from the kirk. He had been raised as a protestant, but may have been influenced by Dumfriesshire Catholics in the 1570s and had converted by 1584. He married Katherine Ker (<i>d</i>. 1600), the daughter of Mark Ker, commendator of Newbattle, whose heir, the first earl of Lothian, married William's second sister, Margaret. Ker of Newbattle had a record of support for religious reform but Katherine's religious views, and the date of her marriage, are unknown. Maxwell and his wife had five sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>William Maxwell became a gentleman of the chamber on 15 October 1580. On 20 January 1583 he succeeded to his father's peerage, being appointed to the privy council six days later. That summer Lord Scrope, the warden of the English west march, listed Herries as hostile towards England and accused him of countenancing cross-border reiving. In April 1584 Scrope thwarted Herries's efforts to support James VI against the Ruthven rebels. Herries attended the parliament which forfeited the latter, but he and Lord Maxwell were infuriated when the crown intervened to have John Johnstone elected provost of Dumfries. This re-initiated the long-running feud between the Maxwell and Johnstone families over pre-eminence in the Scottish west march, and in May 1585 Herries took part in a raid on Johnstone lands at Moffat. However, his conduct was usually less extreme. By July he was attempting to persuade Maxwell to submit, and in September he was commissioned to investigate the death of Lord Russell, killed at a day of truce on the Northumbrian border. On 9 June 1587 Herries was appointed warden of the Scottish west march. In Maxwell's absence he brought a temporary end to the feud with the Johnstones, marrying his sister to Sir James Johnstone. However, he failed to act impartially and in January 1588 was outlawed for failing to hand over offenders from his surname. He submitted in February, but was charged by the general assembly with attending mass in Dumfries. Released from outlawry in March, he was ordered by the council to suppress Catholicism. Herries had resigned his wardenry by 9 July 1588, but in August he became a commissioner for resisting the Spanish Armada.<br>
<br>Herries assisted Maxwell's political rehabilitation in 1589 but the Maxwell / Johnstone feud soon re-erupted. Maxwell was killed in battle with the Johnstones at Dryfe Sands on 6 December 1593, and on 22 December, Herries, who had not been present at the battle, was appointed head of a commission of local lairds to whom the wardenship was entrusted for two months. Herries subsequently acted as warden in his own right but was replaced by 21 July 1594. He was reappointed in December that year or January 1595, but by 8 November had been dismissed for attacking Johnstone settlements around Lockerbie. He came to an assurance with Johnstone, but this was broken. Brought before the council in March 1596 Herries successfully defended his conduct, but in July he was outlawed for failing to appear when summoned. He submitted and was briefly warded in Edinburgh Castle. He then co-operated with royal justice ayres to Dumfries in April and November 1597.<br>
<br>In March 1599 Herries again failed to appear before the council when summoned and was subsequently imprisoned in Tantallon Castle until September. He agreed to submit the Maxwell / Johnstone feud to arbitration in November, and was re-appointed warden on 17 June 1600. On 13 August, however, he was replaced by Sir James Johnstone. This re-ignited the feud and in May 1601 Herries was charged with plotting to undermine Johnstone. He had also returned to Catholicism and in November 1601 was summoned to appear before the council for attending mass and sheltering Jesuits. He appeared in December and was warded in Edinburgh Castle. He was released in January 1602 on condition that he remain in Edinburgh where ministers of the kirk could attempt to reform him. In February Herries agreed to support the kirk but once home he swiftly returned to Catholicism. In May 1602 the general assembly again sought to have him placed in the charge of a minister in Edinburgh. He returned to the capital but did not stay there for long. Herries died on 10 October 1603; his place of death and burial are not known.<br>
