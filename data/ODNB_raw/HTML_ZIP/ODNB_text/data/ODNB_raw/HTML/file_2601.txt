<span class="headword">Blamire,  William</span>  (1790&#150;1862), <span class="occ">farmer and politician</span>, was born on 13 April 1790 at The Oaks, near Dalston, Cumberland, the son of William Blamire (1740&#150;1814), yeoman farmer and naval surgeon, and Jane Curwen (1739/40&#150;1837). He came on both sides of his family from long-established Cumberland yeoman farming stock. His mother was the sister of John Christian Curwen, the Cumberland agriculturist and whig MP, who exerted a major influence on both Blamire's agricultural interests and his political views. Another early influence was William Paley who, as vicar of Dalston, officiated at Blamire's baptism and later gave him informal tuition. In 1799 Blamire became a private pupil of Revd John Fawcett in Carlisle. He was king's scholar at Westminster School, London, from 1805 to 1808 and entered Christ Church, Oxford, with a studentship in 1808 but left the university in 1811 without taking a degree.<br>
<br>Blamire's education had fitted him for a professional career but he preferred practical agricultural experiments, and to these he devoted himself with enthusiasm in the 1810s and 1820s. He attended Curwen's Schoose Farm on his Workington estate, where he learned about animal husbandry, and then travelled extensively in the north-west of England and southern Scotland. At considerable financial cost, since he freely indulged what was in large part a hobby, he became thereby an authority. The contacts he forged with yeoman farmers proved useful to his later political career. To his obituarist in the <span class="italic">Carlisle Journal</span> he became &#145;the very idol of the yeomanry; and his name a household word in every hamlet, dale and nook of Cumberland&#146;. His close links with local landed society were decisive in what was a very popular appointment as high sheriff of Cumberland in April 1828 on the death of the incumbent Thomas Parker.<br>
<br>Blamire was a whig and a reformer and worked to secure Curwen's nomination and election as MP for Cumberland in 1818 and 1820. He was one of the largest graziers in the north of England and his political instincts reflected &#145;country&#146; concerns. He believed in the independence of the landowning classes and&#151;ironically given his career after 1836&#151;was suspicious of central government influence. In 1816, at a public meeting in Cockermouth, he opposed the Liverpool government's attempt to preserve the new income tax in peacetime. Blamire became an MP at the exceptional general election of 1831, which the whigs called after defeats in committee over their parliamentary reform bill. Strongly supported by landowners across the county, he agreed to stand as a reformer alongside Sir James Graham. This involved a challenge, against Graham's advice, to the entrenched political interest of the tory Lowther family and a rare party battle in Cumberland. His success was assured in May when Lowther withdrew from the contest with polls showing that he had less than half the votes cast for Graham and Blamire (453 against 942 and 917 respectively). Blamire's success was part of the pronounced pro-reform swing throughout the country but was widely acclaimed in Cumberland, where large numbers of 40 shilling freeholders had made the frequently difficult journey to the sole polling station in Cockermouth. Blamire celebrated &#145;the force of public opinion in destroying the magic spell of wealth and unconstitutional influence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle Journal</span>). He also welcomed support from ordinary clergymen who had forsaken normally tory loyalties, noting tartly: &#145;You will find no pluralist, no man who holds two livings in the list of Blue [the whig colour in Cumberland] voters&#146;  (Lonsdale, 246).<br>
<br>Blamire took his seat on 20 June 1831 and remained an MP until 1836, being returned unopposed for the newly created seat of East Cumberland at the general elections of 1832 and 1835. He spoke rarely and pithily in parliament, and nearly always from the basis of local knowledge. While generally loyal to the whig government on the reform question, he never neglected local concerns. In July 1831 he concurred, against tory objections, that Cockermouth should lose one of its two members since its population was below 4000. He did not neglect to praise his fellow Cumbrians: &#145;He must &hellip; bear witness to the respectability of the constituency &hellip; He knew of no place more deserving of two Members, if respectability and independence were to determine the question&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 5, 1831, 488&#150;9). He opposed the government on two other matters. He moved an unsuccessful amendment on 22 June 1831 to have the boundaries of Whitehaven adjusted to remove rural voters from the constituency. In August, in a coded attack on the Lowther interest in west Cumberland, he unsuccessfully opposed the creation of a second county seat, arguing that the 9000 county voters would be freer from electoral influence in one constituency.<br>
<br>Most of Blamire's parliamentary speeches after 1832 concerned property. He opposed the <span class="roman">General Registry Bill</span> in January 1832 because of its adverse consequences for copyholders. He stated in July 1833 that new Bank of England charter regulations would damage property owners &#145;in northern parts of the country &hellip; where they had a serious objection to Bank of England paper and preferred country paper, as they had much less difficulty in detecting forgeries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 18, 1833, 1393&#150;4). On 3 April 1834 he married his cousin, Dorothy, youngest daughter of John Taubman of The Nunnery, Isle of Man, and widow of Colonel Mark Wilkes, the late governor of St Helena. The couple, who had no children, lived in Upper Harley Street, London.<br>
<br>Blamire's most important parliamentary contributions concerned the tithe question and these determined the shape of his future career. His extensive knowledge of Cumberland agriculture convinced him of the damage done to rural society by tithes and of the urgent need for legislation. In 1833 he introduced a bill to suspend the rash of tithe suits under the so-called <span class="roman">Tenterden Act</span> of 1832, which had allowed a period of one year during which long-dormant claims could be pressed. His bill, delayed in the Lords, became law in 1834. He made a decisive contribution to the proposals for tithe commutation made by Melbourne's government. His speech to the Commons on 25 March 1836 was made, he said, as &#145;a practical man&#146; with ample opportunity of observing &#145;the workings of the tithing system in its various ramifications&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 32, 1836, 607&#150;16). He urged that parties be given time to come to voluntary agreements, since the imposition of compulsory tithe awards would be unnecessarily expensive and might ignore relevant local circumstances. He also stressed the need to safeguard improving landowners from punitively high commutation awards which threatened their investments.<br>
<br>Blamire's speech won warm commendation from both sides of the house. It also led to his being appointed on 22 August 1836 first tithe commissioner under the new <span class="roman">Commutation Act</span>. With the two other commissioners, Thomas Wentworth Buller and Richard Jones, he wrestled with the complexities of intricate issues of property right. Blamire was recognized as <i>primus inter pares</i> in a job to which he committed enormous time and reserves of energy. He took great care over the appointment as assistant tithe commissioners of practical land agents, since it was their task to negotiate agreements and impose settlements. His determination to let local knowledge and experience carry as much weight as possible within the scope of the act paid rich dividends. The much cheaper voluntary tithe commutation agreements, which his speech of March 1836 had advocated, were effected in almost 58 per cent of all cases. The work of the tithe commission proceeded smoothly. Three-quarters of all tithe awards were completed within the first ten years&#151;a much faster rate of progress than was achieved by the poor-law commissioners&#151;and the tithe commission was able to be wound up on 8 August 1851, virtually laying to rest one of the most contentious areas of property dispute in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century England.<br>
<br>By this time Blamire's success had brought other administrative duties. On 22 June 1841 he became commissioner for copyholds as well as tithes under new copyhold enfranchisement legislation. The work of the copyhold commission increased substantially when compulsory powers were taken under amending legislation passed in 1852, and it absorbed him until his retirement. Blamire's practical efficiency also impressed Peel, who described him as &#145;that indefatigable public servant&#146;  (Lonsdale, 297). He gave influential evidence (1 July 1844) to the House of Commons select committee on commons' enclosure, in which he estimated that there were 8 million acres of unenclosed waste land in England and Wales, much of which could be brought under cultivation. He was invited on 14 August 1845 to become commissioner in charge of the enclosure of commons and wastes under legislation passed to expedite and reduce the cost of enclosure agreements. Here, again until retirement, he supervised the enclosure of about 350,000 acres of common and waste land. Such was the scale of his work that it has been said that he &#145;helped to re-make the face of rural England&#146;  (Spring, 167).<br>
<br>Blamire was one of a small number of &eacute;lite administrators who flourished in the new world of government commissions and regulation created in the 1830s and 1840s and who inaugurated a new era of bureaucracy. Long working hours and prolonged absence from rural Cumberland alike took their toll. He endured paralysis of his right arm from 1847, after which he required the assistance of two secretaries to take dictation, and never fully recovered from his wife's death on 20 September 1857. Deteriorating health forced his resignation from all official duties in September 1860, when he received a pension from the lords of the Treasury. His return to Cumberland did not improve his health and he died at his property, Thackwood Nook, 4 miles south-east of Dalston, on the edge of Inglewood Forest, on 12 January 1862. He was buried on 18 January at Raughtonhead churchyard, 1 mile north of his home.<br>
