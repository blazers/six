<span class="headword">Ker,  Alice Jane Shannan  Stewart</span>  (1853&#150;1943), <span class="occ">doctor and suffragette</span>, was born on 2 December 1853 at Deskford, Cullen, Banffshire, the eldest child of the Revd William Turnbull Ker (1824&#150;1885), minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his wife, Margaret Millar, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stevenson (1826&#150;1900), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48323/', "James Cochran Stevenson")</script>, chemical manufacturer and Liberal MP for South Shields. Her mother's unmarried sisters Elisa, Flora, and Louisa lived in Edinburgh where they were involved in a wide range of social, political, and feminist concerns, their home forming an unofficial centre for the early women's suffrage movement, and, while little is known of Alice's early childhood or her education, she was very close to the Stevenson aunts who, along with her mother, encouraged her to take up a profession.<br>
<br>Through her aunts Alice became acquainted with Sophia Jex-Blake and her student contemporaries at about the time that they were bringing an action against Edinburgh University, attempting to force the institution to permit women to graduate as medical doctors. By 1872 Alice had enrolled at Edinburgh and was taking a variety of classes including anatomy and physiology. In 1873 the university successfully appealed against Jex-Blake's action, effectively closing its doors on women medics. Alice then moved to London to study at the London School of Medicine for Women where she was a strong student, winning prizes in chemistry, materia medica, and practice of medicine. As the school's qualifications were not recognized by the medical register at this time she sat examinations at the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland, the route taken by many female medical pioneers. Alice then spent a further period studying in Boston, USA, and in Bern, Switzerland. She was accepted onto the medical register in 1879, only the thirteenth woman to be so recognized.<br>
<br>Details of Alice's early medical career are sparse, but it is known that she spent some time at the Children's Hospital in Birmingham where she was promoted to senior medical officer in 1881. She also published a book, <span class="italic">Lectures to Women nos. 1&#150;3</span> (1883), which gave pragmatic advice on a number of medical questions. By 1887 she had returned to Edinburgh and was attempting to establish her own medical practice. This work was interrupted by her marriage, in December 1888, to Edward Stewart Ker (1839&#150;1907), a distant cousin who was sole partner in the firm of Stewart Ker &amp; Son, merchants of Liverpool, and the couple moved to Birkenhead. There, Alice was able to establish a name for herself as one of only two women doctors in the area and was appointed to a variety of positions including honorary medical officer to the Wirral Hospital for Sick Children and honorary medical officer at Birkenhead Lying-In Hospital. She published her second medical book, <span class="italic">Motherhood: a Book for every Woman</span> (1891), which gave practical and straightforward medical information on confinement and child rearing. She also built up a successful general practice which she ran from the family home at Grange Road. With her husband, she became a well-known figure in local society, enjoying invitations to many of the major parties of the Liverpool &#145;season&#146;. But she retained an active interest in social questions, especially those relating to women, and became involved in the Women's Local Government Association as well as the RSPCA and the anti-vivisection movement. The couple were also regular attenders at several Anglican churches in Birkenhead.<br>
<br>Alice managed to combine motherhood with her career and voluntary activities. Her first child, Stewart, was born in 1889 but died at the age of sixteen months to the great distress of both parents. Two daughters, Margaret Louise (<i>b</i>. 1892) and Mary Dunlop (<i>b</i>. 1896) followed, both of whom survived. Edward took a full part in the upbringing of his daughters, delighting in pram pushing and family walks, and taking the girls to church. Alice continued her busy professional life with the minimum of domestic help, getting up in the middle of the night to feed or soothe her children, and often taking them with her on her rounds.<br>
<br>In 1907 Edward unexpectedly died. He and Alice had been a devoted couple, sharing many interests and delighting in their young family, and his death was a heavy blow. It also left Alice with some spare leisure time, which she filled by increasing her involvement in women's politics. Since her student days she had been a supporter of the idea of women's suffrage, and was a member of the rather sedate Birkenhead Women's Suffrage Society, affiliated to the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). She became chairman of this group in 1908 but was increasingly frustrated by their gradualist tactics and in the autumn of 1909 switched her allegiance, joining the Liverpool branch of the militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Alice supported a number of militant protests in Liverpool and acted as unofficial WSPU doctor to hunger strikers in Walton gaol. As well as participating in demonstrations and selling <span class="italic">Votes for Women</span> in Liverpool's main shopping streets (which she often did in between visiting patients) Alice was also keen to demonstrate the extent of her commitment through participation in higher levels of militancy. In April 1912 she travelled to London with other members of the Liverpool WSPU to participate in a mass window-smashing raid, smashing windows at Harrods store. Unusually she was offered bail, but declined and was sent to Holloway for two months, where she participated in the hunger strike. During her imprisonment she was emotionally sustained by the support of her WSPU friends, and also by her daughters, who were becoming increasingly involved in &#145;the cause&#146; themselves. Margaret followed her mother's example in November 1912 and was sent to Walton gaol for setting fire to a pillar box in Liverpool. Alice applauded her actions but privately worried that they threatened Margaret's place at Liverpool University and personally appealed to the vice-chancellor to readmit her daughter.<br>
<br>Alice's fears that her more extreme suffrage activities would lead to the family being forced out of Birkenhead proved unfounded, and she continued her general practice after her release, although by this stage it was diminishing largely owing to a combination of her external commitments and her age. Since her husband's death she had gradually cut her association with the Anglican church in favour of unitarianism and also theosophy which was playing an increasingly important role in her life. In 1914 the family moved from Birkenhead to Wavertree garden suburb, outside Liverpool. Alice became a regular attender at the Liverpool theosophical lodge and was elected to its executive committee. Although she made no real attempt to build up a new medical practice she continued to see some patients, especially attending births. Liverpool WSPU effectively ceased functioning at the outbreak of war, but Alice continued some suffrage activities through the United Suffragists, serving as vice-president of the Liverpool branch. She also briefly worked again with some of her old NUWSS colleagues through the Women's War Service Bureau, for which she ran a series of popular classes in first aid techniques.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1916 the family left Liverpool to live in London. It is unclear exactly why they took this step, although there was some general migration from the city during the First World War. Wartime travel was also difficult, and in London Alice and Margaret were more easily able to visit Mary, now studying at Cambridge. The London base allowed Alice to participate more in theosophy at a national level. She became a familiar figure at the society's national headquarters and a keen attender of several London lodges, becoming chair of the Garden Suburb lodge near Hampstead in 1921. She also reactivated her medical career with great vigour, working long hours at a number of school clinics and infant welfare centres until after the end of the war. In the early 1920s she finally relinquished her medical work and went into retirement. For her this was not synonymous with inactivity and she continued to lecture enthusiastically for the Theosophical Society in London and sometimes further afield in Britain for the next two decades. She also retained links with feminism and was honorary secretary of Hendon women's council. In retirement she lived mainly in north London, first with Mary and a companion of Mary's, Olive Foot, and then with Margaret and her companion Muriel Whiteman. Both of her daughters were schoolteachers, and Alice maintained a lively interest in their careers. In her final years she was increasingly housebound, but paid strong attention to current affairs via the radio. She died on 20 March 1943 in her ninetieth year.<br>
