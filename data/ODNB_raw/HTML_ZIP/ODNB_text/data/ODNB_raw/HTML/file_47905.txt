<span class="headword">Mason,  Hugh</span>  (1817&#150;1886), <span class="occ">mill owner and philanthropist</span>, was born at Stalybridge on 30 January 1817, the third and youngest son of Thomas Mason (1782&#150;1868) and his wife, Mary Woolley (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Holden). His father was a joiner, his mother kept a smallware shop, where she sold tapes and gingerbread. During the boom of 1822&#150;5, Thomas Mason moved to nearby Ashton under Lyne, where he became a cotton spinner with three jennies; his son went to school at Stamford Academy in the town. Thomas had first entered the mill at the age of eight, his son Hugh did so at the age of ten, working a 72-hour week for seven years. He then spent the years 1834&#150;8 in a local bank. At the age of twenty-one he entered the mill for a second time but as a partner, and the same year was elected a member of the Manchester exchange. He rapidly became the driving force within the business, and took over its reins from his brothers and his father, who retired in 1862. He extended his horizons beyond the confines of the counting-house, and followed the example set by his father, an ardent advocate of education and social reform. He became an active supporter of the Ashton Mechanics' Institute established in 1839, funding lectures out of his own pocket, and a founder member in 1847, with other radical dissenters and ex-Leaguers, of the Lancashire Public Schools Association.<h2>
<a name="TheOxfordColony"></a>The &#145;Oxford Colony&#146;</h2>Mason's greatest achievement was to transform the two Oxford mills, built in 1845 and 1851, into the nucleus of the &#145;Oxford Colony&#146; of his workfolk. Not merely did Mason treble employment from 200 in 1840 to 620 in 1861, but he also became a convinced and thoroughgoing paternalist, dedicated to improving the welfare of his employees. He came to view himself as simply the steward of his own wealth and his employees as his own brothers and sisters. He built 150 houses with four or six rooms apiece, in the interests of morality and decency. He actively discouraged the employment in the mill of mothers of families. The colonists established their own clutch of associations: a burial club, a friendly society, a band, a choir, and a gardeners' society. Mason sought to provide alternative attractions to the &#145;man traps&#146; of public houses. He provided in 1861 a library, lecture hall, reading-room, and smoking-room. In 1868 he inaugurated the Oxford Institute with an enlarged lecture hall, picture gallery, and baths, supplemented in 1870 by a recreation ground. During the winter season a course of lectures was organized, concluding with a tea party. Mason &#145;gathered round him a band of the &eacute;lite of the working classes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashton Reporter</span>, 28 April 1866, 4, vi), for whom he acquired a profound respect. He received their tributes in the form of a series of addresses and testimonials. He also earned the praise of two factory inspectors for the &#145;noble example&#146; he set to his fellow employers  (<span class="italic">Factory Inspectors' Reports</span>, 31 Oct 1862, 26; <span class="italic">Ashton Reporter</span>, 18 April 1868, 7, vi). He resigned from the local employers' association and denounced trade unions, whether of masters or men, as pernicious to commerce. The contrast between the success of the Oxford Colony and the failure of the Owenite &#145;villages of co-operation&#146; remains noteworthy.<br>
<br>Mason became a town councillor in 1856, a magistrate in 1857, a deputy lieutenant of Lancashire by 1864 and, finally, an alderman in 1866. He served as the mayor of Ashton for three terms of office (1858&#150;60), and proved to be more effective than any of his predecessors. He rooted out bribery, set officials to rights, and infused a new public spirit into the life of the town. He built a new market place, helped to establish the Ashton Penny Bank, and enforced the proper administration of the burial laws. As chairman of the governors of Ashton Infirmary he introduced a more economical system of bookkeeping. He also forced down the price of the gas supplied by the Ashton Gas Company, to the benefit of all consumers.<h2>
<a name="Thecottonfamine"></a>The cotton famine</h2>In 1861 Mason warned, with remarkable prescience, that &#145;a time of trial for both masters and workpeople seems to be approaching us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashton Reporter</span>, 29 June 1861, 4, iii). During the subsequent cotton famine he achieved national eminence by his untiring philanthropy. First, he remained a strenuous supporter of the cause of the North in the American Civil War, a leading spirit of the Union and Emancipation League, and a fearless critic of those hotheads who favoured armed intervention to end the blockade of the cotton ports. Second, he continued to run his own mills full time throughout; only ten other millowners out of two thousand did so. Thereby he maintained both employment and wages, enabling his own operatives to contribute in their turn to the relief of the unemployed. Immediately trade recovered he raised wages by 10 per cent without any solicitation and so confirmed his position &#145;in the front rank of those who have acknowledged the rights and claims of the working classes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ashton Reporter</span>, 28 April 1866, 7, i). Third, he became the prime mover in relieving distress throughout Ashton. That borough was more afflicted by the shortage of cotton than any other in the whole region, and it had almost no middle class to fund the relief of distress. Political and religious feelings ran so high that two separate relief committees were established, representing respectively the Anglican&#150;Conservative interest and the Liberal dissenting interest. It was Mason's achievement to reconstitute his own committee, the Borough Committee, upon a broader basis, and to secure its recognition as the sole responsible agency. At first Mason had thought that relief should be given in the form of food and fuel rather than in money or clothing, because money might be used for gambling and clothes might be pawned. He quickly changed his opinion and favoured the payment of relief in money rather than in kind as being more acceptable to working people. He admired the independence of character of those workmen who disdained to seek relief. He strove to secure increases in the scale of relief, and set an example to other employers by conceding a moratorium upon the payment of cottage rents. He disapproved of both the workhouse test and the labour test. He presided over the rapid construction of the Albion Sunday school in 1861&#150;2, and used the new building to house sewing and reading classes for the unemployed. Fourth, Mason prevented the riots in Stalybridge from spreading to Ashton by his courage and his promptness on 23 March 1863 in reading the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span>, a service he repeated during the Murphy riots of 1868. Fifth, he served on the central executive committee in Manchester (1862&#150;9), first deploring any appeal for aid to London, and then in 1864 urging the government to invest &pound;500,000 in a programme of public works. Finally, he sought to extend the sources of cotton supply so as to avert any recurrence of similar distress in the future.<br>
<br>Mason had been a far-sighted founder in 1857 of the Cotton Supply Association, becoming a member of its executive committee. He also became chairman of the executive committee of the Manchester Cotton Association established in 1860. On 23 September 1862 he boldly called in public for the impeachment of Sir Charles Wood, secretary of state for India, for his consistent obstruction of the efforts made by Lancashire to develop the supply of cotton from India. To the same end he rebuked the government in 1871 for failing to admit the &#145;commercial element&#146; to membership of the Council of India. He also became disturbed by the incidence of speculation in the Liverpool cotton market. He was elected president of the Cotton Spinners' Association, established in 1861 in self-defence against the merchants of Liverpool. He supported the passage of the <span class="roman">Cotton Statistics Act</span> of 1868, and sought in 1871 to improve its administration, so as to reduce the violent fluctuations in the price of cotton.<h2>
<a name="Otherinterests"></a>Other interests</h2>Hugh Mason devoted his great abilities, and his leisure hours, to the service of his fellows, identifying himself fully with the great movements of the age. His natural capacities were those of a leader of men. He was &#145;an exceedingly strong man&#146;, &#145;a man of inflexible will and unswerving integrity&#146;  (I. Petrie, <span class="italic">From Tinder-Box to the &#145;Larger&#146; Light: Threads from the Life of John Mills, Banker</span>, 1899, 88), &#145;a man of great intensity, fixed in his convictions, indomitable in spirit, untiring in energy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Congregationalist</span>, 227). As a Sunday school teacher he early mastered the art of public speaking and he honed it to perfection as a temperance advocate. He developed an early preference for the public meeting to the private canvass in order &#145;to get at the working man&#146;. Lacking in suavity of manner, he preserved an abiding love of plain speech and secured an appreciative response from his audiences. He was elected to the Society of Arts in 1861; he established his own newspaper, the <span class="italic">Ashton News</span> (1868&#150;74) and proposed in 1870 the local adoption of the <span class="roman">Public Libraries Act</span>, donating 1000 volumes to the library when it opened in 1882. He nevertheless remained an apostle of the spoken word and always had a long speech ready for any occasion. Sometimes he spent every evening of the week in chairing a local meeting. In Manchester in the 1870s he would be greeted by audiences of working men with tempestuous cheers and deafening applause.<br>
<br>In the sphere of religion he embodied the best elements of the puritan tradition of the seventeenth century and incarnated &#145;the dissidence of Dissent&#146; from the Anglican church. &#145;In many points he was a nineteenth-century edition of the finest type of the old Puritanism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Congregationalist</span>, 229). He remained a devout worshipper, attending church upon week nights as well as twice on Sundays. Born and bred within the Methodist New Connexion, he transferred his loyalty to the leading Congregational church of the region. He became a member of Albion Congregational Church in 1846, its treasurer in 1858, and a deacon in 1860. He presided at the bi-centenary conference held in Manchester on 13 January 1862, which decided to commemorate the expulsions of 1662 by the erection, in association with the English Congregational Chapel Building Society, of thirty memorial chapels and schools in Lancashire, as well as the restoration of the Independent chapel in Dukinfield, the oldest in the region. As a true nonconformist he became an ardent member of the Liberation Society, and a keen supporter of the British and Foreign Bible Society and the London Missionary Society. In 1863 he chaired a public meeting of the Liberation Society, and in 1873 he opened the restored chapel at Dukinfield.<br>
<br>As a Liberal and a Cobdenite, Mason became in 1866 a founder both of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45600', "Cobden Club")</script> and of the Manchester Reform Club. In 1871 he reduced the working week at the Oxford mills by two hours, generalizing the Saturday half-holiday throughout Tameside and anticipating the <span class="roman">Factory Act</span> of 1874. He became a director of the Manchester chamber of commerce in 1864, a vice-president in 1871, and its president for three terms in 1871&#150;4. Thereby he became the spokesman for the country's staple trade, with its 2 million dependants, as Thomas Bazley had been in the 1850s, and Charles Macara was to be in the 1890s. Mason, however, became the chief executive of the Manchester trade at the period of its greatest importance in the supply of the world market. He infused new spirit into the chamber, extending its remit over the whole sphere of British commerce, reporting to regular quarterly meetings and drafting detailed annual reports. He travelled to Paris as well as to London as the representative of the chamber, sponsored a drive to extend membership, and was honoured by a double vote of thanks on his retirement from office. Three speeches proved highly effective. First, he reproved the banks in 1873 for their reckless competition for business. Second, he boosted in 1873 the campaign against the Indian import duties on Lancashire goods. Third, he criticized in 1875 the mania in Oldham for floating limited companies. Those speeches led to the suspension of mill building in Bombay in 1874 and of company flotation in Oldham in 1875. Mason was appointed by the government in 1872 as a member of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the first member recruited from outside Liverpool. His interests in the Liverpool&#150;Manchester traffic secured his election to the boards of the Bridgewater Navigation and the Midland Railway. When the Manchester Ship Canal was projected, he foretold in 1883 that it would prove to be a ruinous failure.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>Mason was removed from the bench of aldermen in 1874 by his political opponents and withdrew thereafter from local politics. A typical Manchester man and a representative Lancashire radical, his interests extended to embrace the dialect literature of Waugh, Brierley, and Laycock. His zeal, courage, and sagacity enabled him to become a leader of the region's Liberals and nonconformists, and to reach the heights of his fame as a speaker. He served the Liberal Party well as vice-chairman from 1861 of the South Lancashire Registration Association. He secured the holding in Ashton in 1882 of the annual conference of the National Liberal Federation, founded in 1877 by the Birmingham radicals. He had served the Steam Users' Association as a vice-president since 1864, and he became its president in 1875. He also became president of the Society for the Promotion of Scientific Industry in 1875. He was appointed a life governor of Owens College in 1875 and endowed it with a scholarship. Above all, he devoted himself to the temperance agitation, having become a teetotaller in 1870 and a vice-president of the United Kingdom Alliance in 1875. He became president of the Manchester and Salford Temperance Union and of the Band of Hope Union. His crusade against smoking generated his first printed speech, <span class="italic">On the Use of Tobacco</span> (Manchester Anti-Narcotic League, 1885). As the Liberal MP for Ashton (1880&#150;85) he secured the passage of the <span class="roman">Local Option Bill</span> in 1880 and of a <span class="roman">Boiler Explosions Bill</span> in 1882, but failed in an 1883 bid to enfranchise women; he was narrowly defeated in the general election of 1885.<br>
<br>Mason died at his home, Groby Lodge, Jowetts Walk, off Manchester Road, Ashton under Lyne, at the age of sixty-nine on 2 February 1886; he was buried in Dukinfield cemetery on the 6th. His estate of nearly &pound;290,000 may be compared with that of his father, who left less than &pound;20,000. He was married three times: in 1846 to Sarah Buckley; probably in 1853 to Betsey Buckley; and in 1864 to Anne Ashworth. His third wife, two sons, and two daughters survived him. He was commemorated by the erection in 1887 of the first public statue in Ashton. The Oxford Colony survived the demise in 1955 of the firm of Thomas Mason &amp; Son; the Oxford Mills Institute and Social Club bought in 1956 the premises which it had previously leased.<br>
