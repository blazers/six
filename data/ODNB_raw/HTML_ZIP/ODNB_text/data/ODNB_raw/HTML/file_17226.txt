<span class="headword">Luttrell,  Narcissus</span>  (1657&#150;1732), <span class="occ">annalist and book collector</span>, was born on 12 August 1657 in Holborn, London, the third but eldest surviving son of Francis Luttrell (1613&#150;1677) of Gray's Inn (a cadet of the Luttrells of Staunton Court, Devon) and Catherine Mapowder (<i>d</i>. 1685), daughter and coheir of Narcissus Mapowder of Holsworthy, Devon.<br>
<br>Luttrell was educated at Sheen School and entered a fellow commoner of St John's, Cambridge, in February 1674. He received an MA by royal mandate in 1675, but even before his matriculation at Cambridge he was admitted in August 1673 to his father's inn. Luttrell succeeded his father in April 1677. He was called to the bar in 1680, and though he appears to have abandoned practice early in life, he was subsequently elected as bencher in 1702 and ancient in 1706.<br>
<br>Luttrell did, however, put his legal training to use, serving actively as a Middlesex JP for three decades from 1693. On various occasions he also served as a deputy lieutenant, a commissioner of oyer and terminer, and a commissioner of land-tax assessment. He was also twice elected to the House of Commons, sitting for Bossiney (Cornwall) in the second Exclusion Parliament (1679&#150;80) and then in the parliament of 1690&#150;95 for Saltash (Cornwall) upon being returned at a by-election in October 1691.<br>
<br>Luttrell does not appear to have been a frequent speaker in the Commons, and what is known or may be surmised of his political views is not altogether consistent. On the one hand, his obituarist in the <span class="italic">London Evening Journal</span> (6&#150;8 July 1732) characterized him as an exclusionist and a staunch whig, while suggesting that it was Sir Robert Walpole who was responsible for his ouster from the Middlesex commission of the peace in 1723. On the other hand, Luttrell was on good enough terms with Robert Harley, a fellow MP in the 1690&#150;95 parliament and also an avid collector, to solicit (unsuccessfully) a place for his son, Francis (&#145;bred a scholar&#146; and called to the bar), from him as head of the Treasury in 1712, invoking the names of such staunch tories as Francis Gwyn and Sir William Drake as &#145;compurgators&#146; for the rightness of his son's political views (Luttrell to earl of Oxford, 23 Jan 1712, BL, Add. MS 70247; Luttrell to earl of Oxford, 12 Aug 1712, <span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 5.210). It may also be significant that his tenure as a Middlesex deputy lieutenant began under the Harley ministry and that it was not renewed by George I's first ministry. Suffice it, then, to say that his scholarly and collecting activities brought him into contact with a political cross-section that also included Jacob Tonson and Thomas Hearne.<br>
<br>Luttrell's chief contributions were as annalist and collector. Since Macaulay drew attention to them, his chronicles (compiled from newsletters and newspapers) of contemporary events, <span class="italic">A Brief Historical Relation of State Affairs from September 1678 to April 1714</span> (1857), have been frequently cited by students of the period. Even more valuable, as a firsthand account, is the parliamentary diary he kept assiduously during his second term of service in the Commons; the diary is preserved&#151;as are the materials for the <span class="italic">Historical Relation</span>&#151;in the Codrington Library of All Souls College, Oxford. Although the diary (published in 1972 by Clarendon Press) is almost wholly devoid of personal references, it provides a very full account of the debates of the 1691&#150;2 and 1692&#150;3 sessions. Given Luttrell's habits and the survival of much other parliamentary material among his manuscripts in the Codrington Library, it seems quite likely that he kept a similar diary for the final two sessions of that parliament, but its whereabouts, if extant, are unknown. In addition, there survives a brief diary of his service as a deputy lieutenant during 1713&#150;14  (LMA, ACC 619). There is also his private diary for 1722&#150;5 in the British Library; written in Greek characters, its contents have been extracted by P. Dixon in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>  (207, 1962, 388ff.).<br>
<br>In addition to his public service, Luttrell accumulated a valuable collection of contemporary publications, including both political (some listed in his Popish Plot catalogues) and poetical works. After more than three decades of acquisitions (beginning in his student days), he calculated in 1706 that he had laid out over &pound;1500 on such purchases; unfortunately, his wish that his library pass intact to some &#145;public&#146; institution such as Gray's Inn was not wholly heeded by his descendants. So while a substantial number of the printed works from his library were eventually acquired by the British Library, many (often bearing his colophon) have found resting places elsewhere; dated items are listed in <span class="italic">The Luttrell File</span>, compiled by Stephen Parks with Earle Havens (1999). Meanwhile, a large number of his manuscripts found their way by the gift of Luttrell Wynne (grandson of his sister Dorothy Wynne, and a fellow of All Souls College) to the Codrington Library in 1786. More recently, Professor James Osborn donated many items he acquired (at Sotheby sales in 1936 and 1957) in the course of his researches on Luttrell to the Beinecke Library of Yale University. Still others are dispersed and some are not now traceable.<br>
<br>Luttrell made many of his purchases while residing at a house in Holborn (opposite the Three Cups tavern) that he inherited from his mother in 1685. He also inherited other realty worth over &pound;200 p.a., including property at Tregony and Launceston, Cornwall, from his parents  (Luttrell MS C65). He married in February 1682 Sarah, daughter of Daniel Baker (a prosperous London merchant), and their only child, a son, Francis, was born that December.<br>
<br>From 1710 onwards, Luttrell resided in a newly purchased residence (acquired from the third earl of Shaftesbury for &pound;1200) in Chelsea. After Sarah's death in July 1722, he married in May 1725 Mary, daughter of John Bearsley of Wolverhampton. A son was born to them in 1727 but did not survive. Luttrell died at Little Chelsea, after a long illness, on 27 June 1732, leaving his widow, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1745), and his only surviving child, Francis, by his first wife. He was buried at Chelsea. At Francis's death in 1749 the Luttrell library passed to his Wynne kin, eventually to be dispersed by sale and gift.<br>
