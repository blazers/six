<span class="headword">Robinson,  Henry Wheeler</span>  (1872&#150;1945), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 7 February 1872 at 10 Castilian Street, Northampton, the son of George Robinson, a butcher, and his wife, Helen Turner. His father went to South America before the boy's birth, maintaining little or no contact with his wife and child. Robinson's boyhood was a somewhat restricted and shadowed one, but in the home of his mother's uncle, where he lived with his mother, the foundations of his strength of character and concentration of purpose were laid. On leaving school at the age of fifteen he entered the counting-house of a wholesale leather merchant and was soon carrying considerable business responsibilities and spending much time in evening classes.<br>
<br>Association with College Street Baptist Church, one of the strongest nonconformist bodies in the midlands, introduced Robinson to a wider world. He was baptized on profession of faith on 28 March 1888 and began to direct his thoughts towards the Christian ministry. On reaching college his progress was swift and sure. After a year at Regent's Park College, London, as a lay student he entered Edinburgh University, where he graduated in 1895. He came to know J. S. Blackie, and A. S. Pringle-Pattison was among his teachers. He was also influenced by Alexander Whyte and Henry Drummond. In 1895 he went up to Mansfield College, Oxford. Robinson owed much to the encouragement of A. M. Fairbairn, then at the height of his powers, and to the teaching of George Buchanan Gray. He had already determined to concentrate on <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> studies. He was placed in the second class of the school of oriental studies (1898), and was awarded the Hall-Houghton Syriac prize (1900), the junior and senior <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> prizes (1899 and 1901), and the junior and senior Kennicott Hebrew scholarships (1898 and 1901).<br>
<br>In 1900 Robinson married Alice Laura, daughter of Evan Charles Ashford, chemist, of Northampton, and they had a son and two daughters. For six years he served as a Baptist minister, first at Pitlochry (1900&#150;03), then in Coventry (1903&#150;6), discharging his duties with characteristic conscientiousness and intensity, and at the same time carrying forward studies in Hebrew psychology and preparing for future literary work. From 1906 to 1920 he was tutor at Rawdon Baptist college. His gifts as a teacher, although he was exacting, were soon evident, and his first three books&#151;a commentary on <span class="italic">Deuteronomy and Joshua</span> (1907), <span class="italic">The Christian Doctrine of Man</span> (1911), and <span class="italic">The Religious Ideas of the Old Testament</span> (1913)&#151;established his reputation among competent critics. A serious illness in 1913 directed his thinking towards the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the problem of suffering.<br>
<br>Robinson's appointment in 1920 as principal of Regent's Park College, London, gave him wider scope as a teacher and led to the greatest achievement of his life, the transfer of the college to Oxford. His patient and persistent advocacy of the move overcame the hesitations felt by many of his fellow Baptists. A site off St Giles' was secured in 1927, but the stone-laying of the new buildings was not possible until 1938, and a formal opening had to be abandoned owing to the outbreak of war. While in London, Robinson had become a valued member of the London Society for the Study of Religion and a leading figure in the Society for Old Testament Study. With Dr Walter Robert Matthews he planned and edited the <span class="roman">Library of Constructive Theology</span>, an important series of volumes taking religious experience as its starting point. Robinson himself contributed <span class="italic">The Christian Experience of the Holy Spirit</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Redemption and Revelation</span> (1942). He also published many smaller books and essays on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, including a notable study of the Hebrew conception of corporate personality.<br>
<br>In Oxford, Robinson quickly became one of the best-known theological lecturers, in frequent demand as examiner and supervisor. In 1934 he was appointed reader in biblical criticism and in 1937&#150;9 was the first free churchman to be chairman of the board of the faculty of theology. On his retirement from the principalship of Regent's Park College in 1942, he was elected speaker's lecturer in biblical studies and planned to give himself to the writing of a major work on <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> theology. The posthumously published lectures <span class="italic">Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament</span> (1946) were intended as prolegomena. His health, however, failed shortly after his retirement and he died at the Acland Nursing Home in Oxford on 12 May 1945.<br>
<br>Robinson was for many years president of the Baptist Historical Society, and his <span class="italic">Baptist Principles before the Rise of Baptist Churches</span> (1911) and <span class="italic">The Life and Faith of the Baptists</span> (1927) had a wide circulation. He received the honorary degree of DD from the universities of Edinburgh (1926) and Manchester (1943). The wide range of his intellectual interests and influence and the volume of work he accomplished were possible only by rigid self-discipline, but under a somewhat austere manner lay a simple kindliness, a deep interest in human beings, and unusual spiritual understanding and power. His personal faith was most clearly and simply set forth in <span class="italic">The Veil of God</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Suffering, Human and Divine</span> (1940).<br>
