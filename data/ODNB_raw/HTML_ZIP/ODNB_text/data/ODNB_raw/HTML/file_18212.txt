</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Martin,  Thomas</span>  (1697&#150;1771), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 8 March 1697 in the Free School House of the Suffolk parish of St Mary's, adjoining the Norfolk town of Thetford. He was the seventh of nine children of William Martin (<i>c</i>.1650&#150;1721), rector of Great Livermere in Suffolk, and curate of St Mary's, and his wife, Elizabeth Burrough, the only daughter of Thomas Burrough of Bury St Edmunds. He was educated at the free school, where for some time he was the only scholar and left to his own devices. He hoped to study at Cambridge, but about 1715 he was placed against his wishes as an articled clerk with his elder brother Robert, a Thetford attorney.<br>
<br>From an early age Martin was fascinated by the antiquities of his locality and kept notebooks of his visits. When only twelve or thirteen years old he was recommended to Peter Le Neve, Norroy king of arms and president of the Society of Antiquaries, as the most knowledgeable person to act as a guide to the antiquities of the town. The subsequent friendship between the young man and the elderly antiquary was to have a far-reaching effect on the direction of Norfolk historiography for the remainder of the century. Martin was admitted a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries about 1719 on Le Neve's recommendation and remained an enthusiastic and influential member until his death.<br>
<br>About 1721 or 1722 Martin achieved a degree of financial independence by marrying a widow, Sarah Cropley (<i>d</i>. 1731), the daughter of John Tyrell or Thorold; their first child was born in Thetford in 1722. Soon afterwards the couple moved to Palgrave, in Suffolk, where he practised as an attorney. They had eight children, two of whom died young. Sarah died on 15 November 1731, ten days after giving birth to twins.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Martin was a compulsive collector of books and manuscripts, and a great compiler of catalogues. According to Sir John Cullum's preface to Martin's <span class="italic">History of &hellip; Thetford</span>, he was also a &#145;skilful and indefatigable&#146; antiquary and &#145;had the happiest use of his pen, copying, as well as tracing, with dispatch and exactness, the different writing of every aera, and tricking arms, seals, &amp;c, with great neatness&#146;. In September 1724 Eton College paid him &pound;30 for setting the muniment room in order and compiling a digest of records. This was followed by a brief tour into Wales, but thereafter he seems to have spent most of his time in East Anglia.<br>
<br>Peter Le Neve died in 1729, having appointed Martin, together with Thomas Tanner, chancellor of Norwich, and his young widow, Frances (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Beeston), as executors of a complex and idiosyncratic will. Over the next two years Martin spent much time at Le Neve's former home in Great Whitchingham helping the widow to isolate the latter's enormous collection of Norfolk and Suffolk materials from his other book and manuscript collections, which were to be auctioned. Le Neve's Norfolk collection was described by Richard Gough as &#145;the greatest fund of antiquities for his native county that ever was collected for any single one in the kingdom&#146;  (Gough, 2.2). It was intended by the collector to be deposited after his death in an unspecified public repository in Norwich. However, the appointment of Tanner to the see of St Asaph in December 1731, followed by Martin's marriage to Frances Le Neve in January 1732, meant that the terms of the will were never carried out. The couple soon afterwards moved with the collection to Martin's home in Palgrave.<br>
<br>Martin's malversation in respect of the Le Neve manuscripts dismayed Tanner and other members of the Norfolk antiquarian community, such as Benjamin Mackerell, but no one was willing to contest the issue. After Tanner's death in 1735 the matter was quietly forgotten, but it was doubtless why he decided to leave his own manuscripts to the Bodleian Library rather than combine them with Le Neve's collection, as originally intended. Soon afterwards Martin appears to have acquired and relished the seemingly ironic sobriquet Honest Tom, which he retained for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Martin and his second wife had eight children, four of whom did not survive infancy, before Frances died in 1751. Martin continued to enjoy rude good health until old age, in spite of the many colourful accounts of his inordinate drinking bouts and boisterous conduct while under the influence of alcohol. Yet his company was always sought, and his friendship valued, by far more sober and respectable men. However, his continuing obsession with collecting historical antiquities of all kinds, coupled with an increasing neglect of his profession and his dissipated habits, ultimately took their toll of his fortune. By 1762 he was forced to dispose of some of his substantial book and coin collections to meet the increasing demands of his creditors, and this process continued throughout the last decade of his life.<br>
<br>Martin partially redeemed his illegitimate custody of the Le Neve collections by his willingness to make them available to interested scholars, or to provide visitors and correspondents with the benefit of his substantial knowledge and assistance. Thus he was an important figure in the compilation and production of several historical works relating to East Anglia and his assistance is frequently noted. He played a crucial role throughout the prolonged and complex gestation of Francis Blomefield's <span class="italic">History of Norfolk</span> between 1731 and 1775, although he did not live to see it completed. He had encouraged Blomefield to undertake the task and put at his disposal all the Le Neve materials. After Blomefield's death in 1752, Martin purchased many of the author's manuscripts, including the priceless Paston letters, and assisted his widow to dispose of the unsold copies of his history. He then encouraged Charles Parkin to complete the work. Following Parkin's death, he persuaded the King's Lynn bookseller William Whittingham to publish the work and recruited the young antiquary John Fenn to see it through the press.<br>
<br>Martin never published any work during his lifetime in spite of repeated stated intentions of doing so. The history of Thetford bearing his name was compiled after his death from his notes, largely by a Mr Davis, a dissenting minister in Diss. Proposals for this work were issued in 1774 by John Worth, a chemist, who purchased many of Martin's collections. Five sheets were printed in Norwich before Worth's own death brought an end to the project.<br>
<br>Martin died on 7 March 1771, and was buried in the porch of Palgrave church. He still retained a large and valuable collection of printed books and manuscripts at his death, which were disposed of in a complex series of public auctions and private sales. The collection was utterly and irrevocably dispersed within five years of his death. In spite of his disreputable past and dissolute character, Martin was esteemed by the new generation of East Anglian antiquaries. In 1772 John Ives wrote and privately printed <span class="italic">A Pastoral Elegy on the Death of Thomas Martin</span> and paid for an engraved portrait of him. Richard Gough purchased Martin's notes relating to Thetford together with the manuscript by Davis, which he further revised before publishing it in 1779, together with a memoir by Sir John Cullum and Ives's portrait. John Fenn read an account of Martin's life to the Society of Antiquaries in November 1780 and later left money for a monument to him in Palgrave church.<br>
