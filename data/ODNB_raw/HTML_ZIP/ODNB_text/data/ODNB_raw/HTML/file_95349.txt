<span class="headword">Valentine,  Lewis Edward</span>  (1893&#150;1986), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and Welsh nationalist</span>, was born at Hillside, Llanddulas, Denbighshire, on 1 June 1893, the second of seven children of Samuel Valentine (1854&#150;1940), a quarryman and lay preacher, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts (1865&#150;1928). Samuel Valentine had converted to the Baptists as a young man and his wife followed him after marriage, although both had been raised as Wesleyan Methodists, and Valentine was brought up in his parents' adopted denomination at Bethesda, or the Capel Bach (&#145;little chapel&#146;), as it was known, in the village. He claimed later that belonging to a denominational minority, with its spirit of community and pacifism, was something he rediscovered in the Welsh Nationalist Party, or Plaid Bach (&#145;little party&#146;) of which he became a co-founder in 1925.<br>
<br>After attending Llanddulas elementary school and Eirias High School in Colwyn Bay, and a period as a pupil teacher, Valentine entered the University College of North Wales, Bangor, in the autumn of 1913, to study Welsh and Semitic languages. His intention to complete his degree and enter the ministry was upset within a year by the outbreak of the First World War. He carried out non-combatant duties with the Welsh student company of the Royal Army Medical Corps in England, France, and Ireland, returning to Bangor in 1919.<br>
<br>Valentine's war memoirs, <span class="italic">Dyddiadur milwr</span> (&#145;A soldier's diary&#146;), originally published in instalments in the Baptist periodical <span class="italic">Seren Gomer</span> between 1969 and 1972, and in an edited collection of his work in 1988, leave unanswered the question of to what extent the nationalist convictions he expresses there are later interpolations. There is no doubt, however, that the war was crucial to his political development. His upbringing had been typical of turn-of-the-century Welsh nonconformism. Lloyd George's portrait hung over the hearth at Hillside and his parents espoused the Liberal agenda of church disestablishment and were cautiously supportive of home rule. The war would lead their son in a different direction. The conflict itself was traumatic: a shell blast in 1917 left him deaf, dumb, and blind for three months. Moreover, his first direct experience of the English class system, petty military regulations and duties, and what he considered (perhaps again with hindsight) to be the hijacking of the gospel in the interests of national prestige and political and economic advantage, created space for a more lasting influence. In common with other leading figures in the first generation of Welsh nationalists (Saunders Lewis, Ambrose Bebb, and D. J. Williams), he was exposed to the work of the polemicist, critic, and late Victorian Calvinistic Methodist minister Robert Ambrose Jones (Emrys ap Iwan).<br>
<br>Valentine's pieces on Emrys ap Iwan, for the Welsh Nationalist Party's monthly <span class="italic">Y Ddraig Goch</span> in 1933, republished in the literary quarterly <span class="italic">Heddiw</span> in 1936, are curiously bloodless. It is, however, possible to discern in them the political and cultural ideas that would shape Valentine's response to post-war Wales. Emrys ap Iwan's Europeanism (he claimed French ancestry and had spent time in Lausanne and Bonn), along with his call in 1892 for the establishment of a nationalist party &#145;to preserve the Welsh as a nation in feeling and thought&#146;, constituted an overt challenge to the Britishness of which Wales felt itself to be an integral part. Valentine returned from the war a convinced nationalist and pacifist.<br>
<br>His political ideas in the period immediately after the war ran in tandem with the development of his career. He resumed his studies in Bangor, graduating BD (1919) and MA (1921, for a study of Welsh Renaissance translations of <span class="roman">Job</span>), and was ordained in January of the same year as minister of the Tabernacl Baptist Church in Llandudno.<br>
<br>Valentine's earliest mature work appeared in the periodical <span class="italic">Y Deyrnas</span> (&#145;The kingdom&#146;), which he launched and edited in November 1923, its name consciously borrowed from a pacifist non-denominational monthly that had been one of the few organs of dissent during the war. Although not overtly political, it embraced a brand of cultural nationalism, eager to promote Emrys ap Iwan's view that languages and nations are divinely ordained as separate and equal.<br>
<br>The first series of <span class="italic">Y Deyrnas</span> ran until 1930, by which time Valentine was immersed in party politics. His initial contact with organized nationalism had been through meetings of like-minded individuals at a caf&eacute; in Caernarfon in 1924. With the support of a similar group from south Wales, these led in August 1925 to the launch of the Welsh Nationalist Party (later Plaid Cymru). Valentine was among the six who managed to attend the initial gathering in Pwllheli, and was elected president. He held the post for the next year. Three months later he married Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones, from Llandudno, becoming father to a son, Hedd (&#145;Peace&#146;), in August 1926 and a daughter, Gweirrul, in 1932.<br>
<br>Valentine also became the party's first ever parliamentary candidate, contesting the Caernarvonshire constituency in the general election of 1929. He polled 609 votes, or about 1 per cent of the total. The &#145;glorious 600&#146; became part of nationalist folklore. He did not contest another election, but continued to serve as the party's vice-president.<br>
<br>The first half of the 1930s passed without incident, as Valentine established himself in his ministry and raised a family. The defining incident in his life came almost without warning. In late 1935 the Air Ministry announced plans to build a training base for pilots at Penrhos on the Ll&#375;n peninsula. Initially Plaid Cymru saw no political capital in the decision, until Valentine, cited as &#145;Mr X&#146; and described as &#145;one prominent member of the Welsh Nationalist Party&#146;, expressed his opposition, urging members:<blockquote>to go to Porth Neigwl and lay themselves across the road in front of the lorries taking building materials to the Air Station &hellip; The time has come to do something, and if our bodies are broken and lives forfeit, what will it matter if the end is achieved? (<span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, 31 Dec 1935)</blockquote>Valentine, unwittingly, had precipitated arguably the most dramatic incident in the history of Welsh nationalism. Unsure who was responsible for the statement, Saunders Lewis, the party president, faced a dilemma. Dismissing it risked showing lack of leadership; supporting it meant a campaign for which he was unprepared. He chose the latter. By the middle of January 1936 all Plaid Cymru's (still meagre) resources were concentrated on this remote corner of north-west Wales. Letters and petitions followed, culminating in a rally in Pwllheli in May 1936. Valentine, who attended, described it as the party's &#145;baptism of fire&#146;. Speakers were shouted down and scuffles erupted. &#145;It would not be inappropriate&#146;, he wrote immediately after the event, &#145;to liken the insane mob &hellip; who continued to scream the worst blasphemy and filth that ears ever heard, to that madding crowd in the Praetorium who cried &#147;Crucify Him, Crucify Him!&#148;&#146;  (&#145;Bedydd t&acirc;n y Blaid Genedlaethol&#146; [&#145;The National Party's baptism of fire&#146;], <span class="italic">Y Ddraig Goch</span>, June 1936, 5).<br>
<br>The broader protest was more successful, however, attracting support from religious denominations and sections of the Labour and Liberal parties. But faced with official indifference and continuing preparations in the summer of 1936, the party's leadership took direct action. In the early hours of 8 September 1936, Valentine, Saunders Lewis, and another senior party figure, D. J. Williams, set fire to the workmen's huts at Penrhos and surrendered themselves to the police. The &#145;t&acirc;n yn Ll&#375;n&#146; (&#145;fire in Ll&#375;n&#146;), or &#145;Penyberth&#146; (named after the house that stood on the site) became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>. At the first trial, at Caernarfon assizes in October 1936, the jury failed to reach a verdict. Lewis and Williams were carried through the town on the shoulders of their jubilant supporters; Valentine, well over 6 foot tall, was too heavy to receive the same acclaim.<br>
<br>A retrial was ordered, and amid fears that a fair hearing would be impossible in Wales, the lord chief justice insisted on transferring it to the Old Bailey. The second trial, in January 1937, lasted less than an hour, and the jury did not leave the court before reaching their verdict. The three were sentenced to nine months each &#145;in the second division&#146;, a concession that would spare them hard labour and allow them to hold a passport and retain the right to vote on their release.<br>
<br>&#145;My heart did not leap, my knees did not shake, I did not think that the world had come to an end, and I did not experience a single minute of insane panic&#146;, Valentine wrote later  (<span class="italic">Y Ddraig Goch</span>, Nov 1937, 7). His account of his time at Wormwood Scrubs, &#145;Beddau'r byw&#146; (&#145;The graves of the living&#146;), published in instalments in <span class="italic">Y Ddraig Goch</span> between November 1937 and February 1939, echoes his account of the war twenty years before. Again the focus is the visceral response to indignity and discomforts (sparrows roosted in the rafters above the hall where the prisoners congregated, showering them with droppings), set against unexpected lighter moments. He learned elementary French and took advantage of the classes to meet Lewis and Williams.<br>
<br>On his release in August 1937 Valentine resumed his church duties in Llandudno. After the trauma of the previous year he kept a lower profile. The arson did little to increase support for nationalism, and in the event the training base was never developed. The terrain and climate proved unsuitable. The fire, a symbolic protest to mark 400 years since the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1536, was never intended to create a precedent and the party, publicly at least, did not refer to it again. When war was declared in September 1939 Plaid Cymru announced that Wales was neutral, a stance with which Valentine concurred for both pacifist and political reasons. His most public acts during the Second World War were to sign open letters in support of Saunders Lewis's unsuccessful campaign in the University of Wales parliamentary by-election in 1943 and defend the candidate in the same year against charges of seeking to create a Catholic Wales. &#145;Is it rash of me to thank God for Thomas &agrave; Kempis?&#146; he wrote in an open debate with a fellow Baptist on the pages of the denomination's monthly, <span class="italic">Seren Gomer</span>. Personal loyalties ran deep.<br>
<br>In 1947, over a quarter of a century on from his appointment at Tabernacl, aged fifty-two, Valentine moved to Penuel Chapel in Rhosllannerchrugog, Denbighshire. In retrospect he regarded it as not altogether a wise decision, not least because of his wife's close connections with Llandudno. The change, however, prompted a return to writing. He edited <span class="italic">Seren Gomer</span> from 1951 to 1975, completing reviews of over 900 books, and offering a commentary on current affairs. His editorials revisited the ideas first aired in <span class="italic">Y Deyrnas</span> in the 1920s that Welshness was shaped by the Welsh language and Christianity. It is one measure of political and cultural change in Wales that what were considered revolutionary ideas at the beginning of the century were commonplace, even clich&eacute;s, as it drew to a close. In 1962 he was made president of his denomination and, six years later, in July 1968, was reunited with Lewis and Williams: the first and last time the three were together since their days in prison.<br>
<br>Valentine retired in 1970, moving first to Llanddulas and then to Old Colwyn. He lived to witness and comment on events in a changing Wales: the investiture of Prince Charles as prince of Wales in 1969, the unsuccessful referendum for a national assembly in 1979 and Gwynfor Evans's threatened fast to death for a Welsh-language television channel a year later. In a letter to Evans he spoke of his mixed feelings on hearing the news of his &#145;sad, magnificent resolution&#146;: &#145;Elation that one like you has arisen from among us, and guilt that I and my like did not exert ourselves more, and discipline ourselves more severely in attempting to serve our nation in our own generation&#146; (Valentine to Evans, (9 Sept 1980), quoted in Emyr, 254).<br>
<br>Lewis Valentine died, on 5 March 1986 at Como Nursing Home, Llandrillo-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire, and was buried in the town six days later. The service concluded with the singing of his own hymn, set to Sibelius's <span class="italic">Finlandia</span>: &#145;Dros Gymru'n gwlad&#146; (&#145;For Wales our country&#146;), regarded by some as a second Welsh national anthem. He did not live to receive the honorary doctorate of divinity due to be awarded to him by the University of Wales that summer, but an annual memorial lecture in his name was established by the Welsh Baptist Union's Peace Society in 1989.<br>
<br>Valentine's life is inevitably overshadowed by the events of 1936&#150;7. None the less it offers both a representative portrait of a generation shaped by higher education, war, and political and religious upheaval, and an individual story of unaffected principle.<br>
