<span class="headword">Omoniyi, Bandele</span>  (1884&#150;1913), <span class="occ">nationalist and writer on African politics</span>, was born on 6 November 1884 in Lagos in the British colony of Nigeria, the son of Aina Omoniyi. Both his father, said to be headman of a gang of day labourers at the Lagos customs and his mother originated from the Yoruba town of Modakeke, near Ife, in south-western Nigeria. Bandele Omoniyi often styled himself Prince, especially in his political writings and activities in Britain, and claimed to be the nephew of King Lupono of Modakeke. He had also used the name John B. Samuel while in Lagos. Omoniyi was educated at Lagos CMS grammar school, where he also taught, at Edinburgh tutorial college (1906), and at Edinburgh University (1906&#150;7).<br>
<br>Omoniyi first visited Britain in 1905, the cost borne by his father who, despite his humble circumstances, had received sufficient funds for this purpose through the compulsory purchase of his land by the Lagos government. He arrived in Liverpool and may have intended to study in that city. It seems that while there he came into contact with the newly formed Ethiopian Progressive Society (EPA), an early student pan-African organization with members from west Africa and the Caribbean. It was from Liverpool that he wrote to the editor of the <span class="italic">Lagos Standard</span>, complaining about the lack of support the EPA received from west Africa, the undemocratic nature of British rule, and, unusually for this period, the condition and treatment of &#145;the working classes&#146; in west Africa.<br>
<br>In 1906 Omoniyi moved to Edinburgh and until 1907 was enrolled as a student in the faculty of medicine at Edinburgh University. He then decided to study law, but in the middle of the academic session he gave up his classes in order to concentrate on writing in support of the political demands of his compatriots. Throughout 1906 he continued his political activities, sending a series of letters to the British prime minister, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and one to his compatriots, which were all published in the <span class="italic">Lagos Standard</span>. He took up the case for colonial reform and political representation for Africans and opposed the military campaigns that were still being conducted in west Africa. He also called on his compatriots to organize themselves to petition parliament in support of their rights. In the same year he sent another twelve letters demanding an end to discrimination in employment in west Africa to the colonial secretary, Lord Elgin.<br>
<br>In 1907 Omoniyi wrote a series of articles for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> criticizing colonial rule. In the same year he became the first African to write for the Independent Labour Party's <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>. He had already shown an interest in the working classes and with socialism, which he associated with &#145;the equality of freedom and opportunity to all coloured races&#146;  (Adi, 595 n. 40). There is even some evidence to suggest that he wrote a book, which has not yet come to light, entitled <span class="italic">Socialism Examined</span>. An article in the <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span>, &#145;The regeneration of Africa&#146;, which was well received by the press in west Africa, showed his concern with pan-African issues. It defended the 1906 Zulu uprising in Natal as well as presenting an &#145;African Programme&#146; of &#145;urgent reforms which we Africans demand&#146;  (Adi, 593).<br>
<br>In March 1908, at the age of twenty-three, Omoniyi published in Edinburgh his major work, <span class="italic">A Defence of the Ethiopian Movement</span>, which was dedicated &#145;to The Right Honourable and Honourable Members of the British Parliament&#146;. Here he again defended the Natal rebellion and Ethiopianism, an early form of pan-Africanism particularly evident in South Africa; criticized British colonial rule and &#145;brute force imperialism&#146;; and devoted a chapter to &#145;inter-marriage&#146; and &#145;a vindication of the Half-Castes or Coloured Men&#146;  (Adi, 595). His main concern was to urge colonial reforms, and he warned that without them a revolution might take place in Africa that would bring an end to British rule. His writing and correspondence with members of the government brought Omoniyi to the attention of the Colonial Office. In 1908 he began to correspond with the future Labour Party leader Ramsay MacDonald, requesting him to ask a parliamentary question concerning what he believed was an attack on the town of Modakeke by the colonial authorities. MacDonald contacted the Colonial Office, which had already begun to collect damaging but unsubstantiated information about Omoniyi.<br>
<br>Little more is known of Omoniyi's life until in 1912 he again contacted the Colonial Office, this time from Par&aacute;-Bel&eacute;m, Brazil. According to his own account he had been selling gold-mining concessions in Brazil for some eighteen months but was also involved in Brazilian politics. In addition he had written a manifesto, one of the first political documents written by an African in Nigeria's history, concerned with the &#145;elevation of the mass of the Nigerians to a position of respect and honour&#146;  (Langley, 181), the need for a political party to represent their interests, and the demand for a federal, semi-autonomous Nigeria. Omoniyi was in contact with the Colonial Office again following his arrest and temporary imprisonment for taking an active part in political disturbances.<br>
<br>Omoniyi's intervention in Brazilian politics was his last political act. A few months later, on 2 January 1913, he died, at the age of twenty-eight, from acute beri-beri in the Hospital da Caridade in Par&aacute;-Bel&eacute;m. It was reported that &#145;he left no estate, and his effects were seized in lieu of rent; his interment provided by the hospital authorities&#146;  (Adi, 604).<br>
