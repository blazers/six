<span class="headword">Parr, Sir  William</span>  (1434&#150;1483), <span class="occ">knight</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal, Westmorland, and Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas Tunstall of Thurland, Lancashire. William succeeded at his father's death late in November 1461. Thomas Parr had been a follower of Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, and in the 1460s William maintained the link with the Nevilles, now headed by Salisbury's son Richard, earl of Warwick. Knighted in 1462, he became an increasingly important figure in north-west England, where he was appointed to numerous commissions, and in 1463 was granted (with his brother John) &pound;100 per annum from the forfeited lands of the Lancastrian Sir Henry Bellingham. Having played an important part in Warwick's victory over a royal army at Edgecote in 1469, Parr accompanied the earl during the following year's Lincolnshire rising, and was sent by him to the king on 19 March with a request for safe conduct and guaranteed pardon. Edward IV refused, and charged Parr on his allegiance to leave Warwick and Clarence if they refused to surrender, and to urge his fellows to do the same.<br>
<br>Parr appears to have acted on the command. On 6 May the king appointed him lieutenant of Carlisle and of the western march, where Warwick had been captain and warden since 1465, and he does not appear in the list of the earl's adherents drawn up after Warwick's flight. During the readeption of Henry VI, Parr was dropped from the commissions of the peace for Cumberland and Westmorland. On Edward's return from exile in 1471 he joined him at Nottingham. Both his brothers were also in the Yorkist camp and the youngest, Thomas, was killed fighting for the duke of Gloucester at Barnet. Parr became a knight of the king's body, and in July 1471 was rewarded with an extensive land grant, including the castles of Burgh, Pendragon, and Appleby, and with control of a third part of the crown share in the barony of Kendal. He was controller of the royal household from 1471 to 1475, and a royal councillor from July 1471. He also regularly served on embassies to Scotland. He was made a knight of the Garter in 1474. In 1475 he accompanied the king on his French campaign, and was one of the executors of the will Edward made before his departure. In 1481 his closeness to the king was further recognized when he once more became controller of the household, in succession to Sir Robert Wingfield. Like many of Edward's northern servants he also built up links with the duke of Gloucester, who had succeeded to the Nevilles' northern lands and to their pre-eminence in the north-west. Having long been a member of Gloucester's council, he was one of the commissioners to whom the duke's office of constable was committed in 1482.<br>
<br>In April 1483 Parr played a leading role in the burial of Edward IV at Windsor. It was intended that he and his second wife, Elizabeth, should be no less prominent at the coronation of Richard III on 6 July following: she as a gentlewoman of Queen Anne, he as one of the knights who held the canopy over the king during his anointing. But Parr did not live long enough to benefit from the accession of his patron. He was dead by 3 December 1483. His first wife was Joan Trusbut, the widow of Thomas Colt, esquire. Colt died late in 1467 and Joan had married William by July 1468. The marriage was probably arranged under the aegis of Parr's lord the earl of Warwick, for Colt (whose father had come from Carlisle) was also a Neville associate, and Warwick headed the feoffees for the marriage settlement. Joan was a considerable heiress in her own right and brought her husband, among other land, the manor of Netherhall in Roydon, Essex. She died in 1473, and William initially enjoyed the custody of her lands and those of her son by Colt, but in February 1476 they were transferred to John Elrington, the treasurer of the king's household. By June 1475 Parr had married Elizabeth (1462&#150;<i>c</i>.1505), one of the daughters of Henry, Lord Fitzhugh, and Alice Neville, daughter of the Parrs' former patron, the earl of Salisbury. She was the mother of all William's children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58875/', "Sir Thomas Parr (1478&#150;1517)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52790/', "Parr family")</script>]; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58528/', "William Parr, Baron Parr of Horton")</script>; John; and Anne.<br>
<br>William Parr worked closely with his younger brother <a name="cosubject_58524"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Parr</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1475)<span class="occ"></span>. The two brothers shared all Edward IV's land grants and John Parr strengthened the family influence in Westmorland by his appointment (in May 1462) as hereditary sheriff of the county. Both combined their northern interests with a place in the king's household, but the emphasis was different, with John much more of a courtier than his brother. John was a king's esquire by December 1461 when he was appointed steward of the forfeited Clifford lands in Westmorland. He was with the court in East Anglia in 1469, when the news broke of disaffection in the north, and he remained loyal to Edward IV throughout the crisis which followed. He was knighted by Edward on the field at Tewkesbury and became a knight of the king's body. By March 1475 he was the king's master of horse, perhaps partly in tribute to his tourneying skills: he had been among the courtiers who had jousted at Eltham in 1467. He had then been in the team of William, Lord Hastings, with whom he shared several grants of ecclesiastical patronage. He was much involved in preparations for the war with France. In March 1474 he was appointed to muster troops being sent to Burgundy, and in January 1475 he travelled to Flanders to buy horses and armour. He was among those retained for the campaign, and was paid the first instalment of his wages, but he was dead by 1 June 1475 when William Parr succeeded him as sheriff of Westmorland.<br>
<br>In the redistribution of local authority which followed Edward IV's return in 1471, John Parr was apparently cast for a role in Warwickshire. He was constable of Kenilworth from June 1471 to May 1474, and was named to the Warwickshire commissions of the peace from 1471 until his death. His southern base seems, however, to have been the Colt manor of Netherhall and it was only after John's death that William surrendered the Colt lands. John Parr married a daughter of Sir John Young or Yonge, mayor of London. To judge by a jocular reference in a letter from John (III) Paston, the marriage was still recent in June 1472. Paston then wrote to his brother:<blockquote>I prey yow recomand me to Syr John Parre wyth all my seruys, and tell hym by my trouthe I longyd neuer sorer to se my lady then I do to se hys mastershepe. And I prey God that he aryse neuer a mornyng fro my lady his wyff wyth-owght it be ageyn her wyll tyll syche tyme as he bryng hyr to Ouyr Lady of Walsyngham. (Davis, 1.574)</blockquote>
