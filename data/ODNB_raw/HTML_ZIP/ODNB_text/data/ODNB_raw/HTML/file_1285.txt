<span class="headword">Bank <span class="st"> [Banke]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1415), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably the son of John Bank of Bank Newton in Gargrave, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Bank seems likely to have distinguished himself during his legal training at one of the London inns of court, for his is the only name of a practising lawyer found in the moot cases of the period. He first appears in government records in 1388, when, as Richard Bank of Yorkshire, he is listed as one of a group of four men providing surety for the good behaviour of John Gargrave, previously imprisoned at Newgate &#145;upon suspicion of spying out the king's counsel&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1385&#150;1389</span>, 597). In 1395 he was one of three commissioners appointed to inquire into expenditure on the paving of the road between Charing Cross and the New Temple Bar. He served as lord treasurer's remembrancer from 1397 to 1410, his career apparently undamaged by the deposition of Richard II and the succession of Henry IV, and he was one of a group of seven commissioners, headed by Sir William Rickhill, appointed in 1403 to inquire into the case of &#145;certain bondmen and tenants in bondage &hellip; who have leagued themselves together to refuse their due services&#146; at Tottenham in Middlesex  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1401&#150;5</i>, 361). On 19 June 1410 Bank was named as one of the barons of the exchequer, and his appointment was renewed on 28 April 1413. He died, probably in London, in 1415, between 19 October, when he added a codicil to his will, and 2 December, when probate was granted. However, owing to a clerical oversight he continued to be paid his baron's salary until Michaelmas 1416.<br>
<br>It is likely that Bank's patron, possibly his mentor, had been Sir Robert Plessington, who was chief baron of the exchequer between 1380 and 1386. Plessington had lands in Wharfedale, Yorkshire, close to Bank's home; in May 1405 moreover, Bank was granted the wardship and marriage of Plessington's son, also Robert. Bank's will, dated 6 October 1415, records his receipt of 11 marks owed to the younger Robert, and also refers to some of the father's law books and two silver belts which had come into his possession. The closeness of the relationship is suggested by Bank's stipulation that the belts are to be sold and the proceeds distributed &#145;for his soul, my soul and the souls of all to whom Robert was indebted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Register of Henry Chichele</span>, 2.67).<br>
<br>Bank was married to Margaret, daughter of William Rivere, who predeceased him. There were three children of the marriage: William, Thomas, and Elizabeth. Two of his brothers are mentioned in his will: John Pierson (perhaps a half-brother) and Thomas Bank; the latter was also a lawyer, who is recorded as attorney in the exchequer for the duchy of Lancaster in 1399, and died as a baron of the exchequer in 1426. Richard Bank's main bequests were &pound;100 to each of his children, four silver cups, and his armour, in addition to his books. In his will Bank stipulated that, should he die in London, he was to be buried next to his wife in the priory of St Bartholomew, Smithfield; Stow confirms that there was a memorial to them there. Bank's ties with Yorkshire were not forgotten; the codicil to his will left 100 marks for a chantry in the church of St Mary of Whixley, York, where his family also owned property.<br>
