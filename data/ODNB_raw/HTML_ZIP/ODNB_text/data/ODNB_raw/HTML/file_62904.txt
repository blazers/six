<span class="headword">Jones,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gwilym Cadfan]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1726, <em>d.</em> 1795), <span class="occ">poet and radical</span>, was baptized on 18 June 1726 at Llangadfan parish church, Montgomeryshire, the youngest of three sons born to William Si&ocirc;n Dafydd (1666&#150;1758), a farmer and stagecoach guard, and his second wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1760). He took up his father's tenancy of Dolhywel in 1750, a decision which consigned him to a life of unremitting toil and poverty. Yet, in an age which prized versatility, he was an unusually gifted all-rounder and a remarkably intelligent, sophisticated, and well-read man. His fellow parishioners could only marvel at his gifts as a country healer, musician, poet (his bardic name was Gwilym Cadfan), raconteur, linguist, eisteddfod adjudicator, historian, and amateur astronomer. He offered his services as a collector and transcriber of Welsh manuscripts to leading Welsh and Celtic scholars in London, and Walter Davies, his bardic disciple, believed that in Welsh prosody and syntax Jones &#145;ranked among the profoundest critics that Wales has ever produced&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cambrian Register</span>, 11, 1796, 239).<br>
<br>Well versed in free-metre and strict-metre Welsh poetry, Jones also translated from Latin into Welsh some of the odes of Horace and parts of Ovid's <span class="italic">Metamorphoses</span>. Much of the content of the enlarged edition of Edward Jones's <span class="italic">Musical and Poetick Relicks of the Welsh Bards</span> (1794) was the fruit of William Jones's tireless research. Not the least of his achievements, too, was to record and revive the traditional country dances associated with the parish of Llangadfan and his efforts to rid the Welsh of their musical amnesia.<br>
<br>Although Jones was deeply interested in Welsh literature, his researches on behalf of London Welsh scholars were also prompted by the need to make ends meet. Trapped by his penury in the barren upland wastes of mid-Wales and by the illness of his wife, Ann, he was obliged to seek ways of supplementing his income. As a part-time country healer (he despised the term &#145;quack&#146;) he earned considerable respect in the county, not least because of the deft use he made of herbal lore. The Llangadfan vestry books bear witness to his care for sick people by purging, bloodletting, excising tumours, extracting teeth, and healing malignant fevers and agues. All his patients were informed in considerable detail of his success in conquering scrofula and those who cast doubt on his competence were shown his scars.<br>
<br>Jones was much in demand as an adjudicator in national and local eisteddfodau, and also participated in some of Iolo Morganwg's gorsedds in London. He was remarkably well informed about current affairs, partly because members of the Gwyneddigion Society visited him regularly but mainly because he pestered members of parliament and foreign ambassadors for information. Letters, books, magazines, squibs, and ballads were sent by the score to Cann Office, a staging post at Llangadfan, and Jones developed a particular interest in astronomy, physics, geography, topography, and navigation. He traced the voyages of Captain Cook, familiarized himself with the terrain of Africa, Arabia, Brazil, and Egypt, and few in Britain were better acquainted with the civilization of the Incas and the culture of the elusive Padoucas (white-skinned Welsh Indians, the alleged descendants of Madoc, son of Owain Gwynedd), who were believed to dwell in the upper reaches of the Missouri.<br>
<br>Like many cultural nationalists and myth-makers in eighteenth-century Europe, Jones was determined to enhance the self-image of his people by campaigning on behalf of Welsh national institutions. He was among the first to call for a national library and a truly national eisteddfod. He composed a robust Welsh national anthem&#151;the first of its kind in modern Wales&#151;based on the refrain &#145;And join in joyful song on the fair break of dawn&#146;. Stirringly patriotic, the anthem was his riposte to the jingoism of &#145;Rule Britannia&#146; and &#145;The Roast Beef of Old England&#146;.<br>
<br>Jones's political radicalism owed much to the inspiration of the French Revolution. In many ways, he discovered his political voice in 1789, and his correspondence is riddled with barbed references to fleecers, tyrants, and oppressors. A self-styled sans culotte, he prized the works of Voltaire above all others, so much so that he became known as the Rural Voltaire. Jones bore more than a passing resemblance to Voltaire and he also shared his Ranter-like fondness for satire, blasphemy, and vulgar jokes. Jones's penchant for bawdiness is best exemplified in his unpublished poem &#145;The Enraptur'd Lover to the Tune of Jack ye Latin&#146;, and the rector of Llangadfan, who dubbed him &#145;a rank republican [and] a Leveller&#146;  (NL Wales, MS 1806E, fol. 786), believed that he deserved to be peppered with gunshot and powder. During William Pitt's &#145;reign of terror&#146; government spies intercepted, opened, and destroyed letters to and from Jones, and doubtless many of them were horrified by his scabrous comments about despotic Saxons and Normans. One of Jones's most loyal friends reckoned that he was &#145;the hottest arsed Welshman he had ever known&#146;  (NL Wales, MS 13221E, fol. 256).<br>
<br>Weary of poverty, persecution, and neglect, William Jones resolved to emigrate to the Land of Liberty. His aim was to purchase cheap and fruitful land in Kentucky and also to embark on an expedition in search of the Lost Welsh Brothers. But illness and old age conspired against him, and the Welsh Voltaire died in November 1795. The final wish of this incorrigible infidel was that he should be laid to rest in unconsecrated ground in the graveyard of Llangadfan parish church.<br>
