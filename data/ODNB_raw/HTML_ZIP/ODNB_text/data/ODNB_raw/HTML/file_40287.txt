<span class="headword">Bilsland,  (Alexander) Steven</span>, Baron Bilsland  (1892&#150;1970), <span class="occ">banker and Scottish business leader</span>, was born on 13 September 1892, at 28 Park Circus, Glasgow, second but only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50407/', "Sir William Bilsland, first baronet (1847&#150;1921)")</script>, and his wife, Agnes Ann Steven (<i>d</i>. 1935). His father was a rich baker, who received a baronetcy (1907) during his lord provostship of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Steven Bilsland was educated in Glasgow, and at St John's College, Cambridge, of which he became an honorary fellow (1956). During the First World War he was a captain in the Cameronians (8th battalion the Scottish Rifles), served on the staff, and was awarded the MC. In the immediate post-war period he was a director of Gray, Dunn &amp; Co., biscuit manufacturers, and of the private banking firm of Bilsland Brothers. In 1921 he succeeded to the baronetcy, and afterwards became chairman of the family bank.<br>
<br>During the early 1920s Bilsland joined the boards of the Union Bank, the Glasgow Stockholders Trust, and the Scottish Amicable Life Insurance Society. He was a caring capitalist, who felt responsible for promoting the good of others, and constantly supported projects to further Scottish economic progress. He served on the advisory board of Credit for Industry, formed in 1934 as a subsidiary of the Union Dominion Trust to provide finance of up to &pound;50,000. In 1938 he advocated the establishment of a Scottish Development Finance Corporation to provide, in conjunction with Scottish banks, funding and constructive ideas for businesses, but this idea was resisted by other bankers. Bilsland was, however, involved in founding the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation set up to invest in smaller companies, and remedy the Macmillan gap (1945). As chairman of the Union Bank he negotiated its merger (1950&#150;52) with the Bank of Scotland, of which he became deputy governor (1955) and governor (1957&#150;66). He also rose to be chairman of the Glasgow Stockholders' Trust and president of Scottish Amicable.<br>
<br>In 1922 Bilsland married Amy Janet (<i>d</i>. 1979), only daughter of David Colville, iron and steel master; the marriage was childless, and Bilsland was ebullient, kind, and attentive with children. His sister Agnes (1890&#150;1970) had previously married Amy's cousin David John Colville, afterwards first Baron Clydesmuir. As a result of these connections he was a director of Colvilles Ltd, steel makers (1937&#150;65), with a special interest in finance. He joined the boards of John Brown &amp; Co., Clydebank shipbuilders, and in 1947 of Burmah Oil, where the chairman relied on his common-sense assessment of new proposals and strategic policy.<br>
<br>Intent on reducing Scottish unemployment Bilsland, together with Sir James Lithgow and Lord Elgin, promoted the Scottish Development Council in 1931. He was also an influential member of the Scottish Council on Industry. When these two bodies were combined as the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), Bilsland was first chairman of the executive committee (1946&#150;55) and president from 1946. He often represented the council in the USA, where he received the medal of freedom and honorary foreign membership of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His mantle at the Scottish Council was assumed by his nephew Ronald John Bilsland Colville, second Baron Clydesmuir, who admired him deeply.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s Bilsland became a director of Workmen's Dwelling Company Ltd; later, as first chairman of Scottish Industrial Estates Ltd (1937&#150;55), and of Lanarkshire Industrial Estates (1938&#150;55), he pioneered industrial estates as a way of stimulating new industries in Scotland. Bilsland's association with this work led to his honorary associateship of the Royal Institute of British Architects.<br>
<br>Bilsland was president of Glasgow chamber of commerce (1933&#150;5), honorary colonel of 57th Searchlight regiment of the Royal Artillery, and district commissioner for civil defence in western Scotland, responsible for organizing 60 per cent of the Scottish population (1940&#150;44). He was a Glasgow magistrate (1927), deputy lieutenant for Inverness-shire (1942), a member of the queen's bodyguard for Scotland, received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow (1948) and Aberdeen (1956), and the freedom of Aberdeen (1956). He was created Baron Bilsland, of Kinrara, Inverness-shire (31 January 1950) and became a knight of the Order of the Thistle in 1955. He died after a stroke, at his home, 69 Kelvin Court, Glasgow, on 10 December 1970. His hereditary titles became extinct.<br>
