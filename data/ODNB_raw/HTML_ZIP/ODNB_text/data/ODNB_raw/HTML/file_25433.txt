<span class="headword">Shirley, Sir  Robert</span>, Count Shirley in the papal nobility  (<em>c.</em>1581&#150;1628), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was born at the family estate of Wiston in Sussex, the youngest son and one of nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25435/', "Sir Thomas Sherley (c.1542&#150;1612)")</script> and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1623), daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe of Ollantighe, Kent. While details of his education are unclear, given the state of the family fortune by the early 1590s it is unlikely that it was as rigorous as that of his elder brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25436/', "Sir Thomas Sherley (1564&#150;1633/4)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25423/', "Sir Anthony Sherley (1565&#150;1636?)")</script>. He certainly did not attend university, for in 1598 he was resident at the court of Ferdinand, grand duke of Tuscany, where he had been for five years.<br>
<br>When Anthony Sherley's scheme to incite war over Ferrara collapsed in 1598, Robert Shirley travelled to Venice to join him. Seduced by stories of Persia's wealth, about May 1599 the brothers sought passage on an Italian merchantman bound for Aleppo. But, with poor weather impeding their progress and with tempers running high, an altercation broke out after Anthony had one of the Italian crew flogged for insulting the queen. The situation escalated when Shirley gave the ship's captain a &#145;sound boxe&#146;  (Parry, 5&#150;6) after the latter tried to reassert his authority. Bloodshed was averted only when Italian merchants on board suggested that the English be left at Zante. The party finally reached Aleppo in September; from there they travelled overland to Qazvin in Persia, where they arrived in December.<br>
<br>After a series of meetings with Shah &#145;Abbas I through the spring of 1600, Anthony was dispatched to negotiate an alliance with the princes of Europe against the Turks; Robert remained behind as a hostage. Initially he was treated well and seems to have helped the shah reorganize his army. Probably about 1603, while in the shah's service, he was converted to Catholicism by the Augustinian friar Antonio de Gouveia. By 1605 though, with no news from Anthony, the shah became markedly cooler towards his guest; in a letter to his brother dated 10 September 1606 Shirley lamented that he was esteemed little more than &#145;a common liar&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 2, no. 353). In February 1608 he married Sampsonia (<i>c</i>.1590&#150;1668), the daughter of a Christian Circassian chieftan, Isma&#145;il Khan. She was baptized by the Carmelites and given the name Teresa.<br>
<br>Having heard nothing from Anthony in seven years, &#145;Abbas selected Shirley to lead a second embassy to Europe. The Shirleys left Persia on 12 February 1608, and in the autumn reached Cracow, where they wintered at the court of Sigismund III. With Teresa housed in a Polish convent, Shirley continued on to Prague, where he was received by Emperor Rudolf II, who knighted him and made him a count palatine in June 1609. After a month in Florence, Shirley entered Rome on 27 September 1609, dressed in his characteristic Persian garb, a gold crucifix affixed to his turban. When he met Pope Paul V two days later he delivered a letter from the shah urging the pope to induce the princes of Christendom to unite and fight the Turks. For his efforts, the pope created Robert a count of the Lateran.<br>
<br>From Rome, Shirley continued to Spain where he met Philip III in January 1610. However, the king regarded the shah's suggestion that the Spanish attack the Turks through Aleppo and Anatolia coolly. With commercial negotiations between the two realms proceeding slowly, in May Shirley sent to Poland for his wife. However, his standing as an emissary was undermined in February 1611 by the arrival of a new Persian ambassador, Dengil Beg Rumlu. Thus in the summer of 1611 Shirley and the pregnant Teresa left Spain, reaching England in August. On 1 October Shirley was received by James I at Hampton Court, where they discussed the shah's offer to give English merchants free use of two Persian ports and a monopoly over the Persian silk trade. While James himself was not uninterested in the idea of an alliance with Persia, given that the scheme was calculated by the shah to redirect the silk trade away from the Turks, it was opposed by the Levant Company. A month later, on 4 November 1611, Shirley announced the birth of his first and only child, a son, who was named Henry.<br>
<br>Although negotiations dragged on into 1612, news of peace between the Turks and Persians rendered Shirley's mission moot. Thus in January 1613, leaving Henry at Wiston, he and his wife boarded <i>The Expedition</i> to return to Persia, resolving to sail to Gwatar Bay in Baluchistan and then travel overland back to Esfahan. However, when they landed in August they overheard a plot to kill their party and to loot their baggage. They were forced to sail east down the coast to the mouth of the Indus, where they disembarked in late September 1613. Here they only narrowly escaped a conspiracy orchestrated by the Portuguese in collusion with the local viceroy to blow up their lodgings in Tatta. Determined to seek redress for his injuries from the Mughal emperor, in the spring of 1614 Shirley travelled to Ajmer. There he was well received by Jahangir and met Thomas Kerridge, factor of the East India Company in Surat, to whom he furnished a description of the Persian ports suitable for English ships along the Arabian Sea. At the end of September he joined a caravan bound for Persia and, about Christmas near Lahore, he met Thomas Coryate. The party finally reached Esfahan in March 1615.<br>
<br>Shirley did not remain in Persia long, for in the summer &#145;Abbas asked him to return to Europe, this time to reassure the Spanish while the shah sought the support of a maritime power to help against the Portuguese at Hormoz. Reluctantly Shirley agreed to go. However, before he left he helped Richard Steel and John Crouther, the first representatives of the East India Company to reach Persia, to secure a series of trade concessions. After boarding a Portuguese ship in November, Shirley and his wife arrived in Goa in late February 1616 but had missed the annual convoy for Spain. Delayed in Goa for another year, it was not until September 1617 that they finally reached Spain, where they remained engaged in fruitless negotiations until 1622.<br>
<br>Shirley and his wife left Spain in March 1622 and were in Rome by the end of July. Here, in full Persian dress, they both sat for paintings by Sir Anthony Van Dyck. Details of Shirley's activities over the next year are decidedly sketchy; however, he does seem to have had an audience with the emperor in Vienna in late 1622.<br>
<br>Late in 1623 the Shirleys arrived in England and on 28 January 1624 Shirley was granted an audience with the king in which he proposed a scheme which would effectively secure for the English a monopoly over the Persian silk trade. While James liked the idea, the merchants of the East India and Levant companies seriously doubted the capacity of the European market to absorb the volume of silk the shah proposed to export and felt that such a scheme would damage irreparably their Indian and Turkish trade.<br>
<br>Through the rest of 1624 and until James's death in March 1625 tensions between the king and the companies ran high over the scheme, the king going so far as proposing to venture personally into the Persian trade. While Charles I also expressed interest, Shirley's position was seriously compromised by the arrival, in February 1626, of a second emissary from the shah, Naqd Ali Beg. However, when the two ambassadors met in early March Naqd Ali Beg attacked Shirley, beating him severely. As a result, Charles resolved to send Sir Dodmore Cotton to Persia as an envoy; Shirley was to accompany him as a private citizen in order to clear his name. To this end the king demanded that the company transport Shirley's party to the Persian Gulf with its next India fleet. However, when the party arrived in Deal on 20 April 1626, they found the company's ships had already left. After a further year in England, Cotton, Shirley, and his wife boarded <i>The Star</i> in March 1627 for the voyage to Persia. Naqd Ali Beg returned home on <i>The Hart</i> only to die from an overdose of opium on 30 November, the day before the fleet reached Swally Road.<br>
<br>It was not until May 1628 that Shirley finally reached Ashraf, where he was favourably received by the shah late in the month. Although he followed when the shah moved his court to Qazvin in June, he had no further audience with the potentate. Suffering from a fever, Robert died on 13 July 1628 at Qazvin, where he was buried by his friends under the threshold of his house. Lady Shirley left Persia shortly afterwards and stayed in Constantinople for three years before retiring to Rome in December 1634. In 1658 she had her husband's remains reburied in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where she herself was buried in 1668.<br>
