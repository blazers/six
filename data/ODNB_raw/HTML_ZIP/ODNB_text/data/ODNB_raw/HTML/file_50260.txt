<span class="headword">Latimer, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1341&#150;1401), <span class="occ">soldier and alleged heretic</span>, was the third son of Sir Warin Latimer of Braybrooke, Northamptonshire, and Katherine, daughter of John de la Warr, born between 10 and 17 September 1341. He is chiefly notable as the most conspicuous, if not the most fervent, member of a group of courtiers and soldiers disparaged by the chroniclers Thomas Walsingham and Henry Knighton for their heretical views, and known collectively as the &#145;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50540/', "Lollard knights")</script>&#146;.<br>
<br>Predeceased by his two older brothers Latimer proved his majority in November 1362, and thereupon inherited a sizeable estate in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, and Somerset. Knighted by 1365 he probably began his career as a soldier in the service of Edward, the Black Prince, in whose Gascon and Spanish campaigns he fought from 1365 to 1370, and of whom he held his castle and manor of Braybrooke. He married Anne, the widow of Sir John Beysin, by April 1366. As a companion to Joan, princess of Wales, she had been present at the birth of the future Richard II in 1367, and she brought to her husband a life interest in a large estate in Staffordshire and Shropshire. Latimer also took part in the Spanish and Breton expeditions of 1373&#150;4 and 1377&#150;8, but in the retinue of the prince's younger brother, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster. It was probably his relationship with the latter that secured his election as a knight of the shire for Northamptonshire in the parliaments of January 1377 and October 1378, which were packed with Gaunt's supporters. He was also appointed to several oyer and terminer commissions there from 1378 to 1385, and sat on the peace commission from 1381 to 1385.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1385 Latimer was ordered by Richard II to attend upon Joan, princess of Wales, along with other Lollard knights then in the king's service. His interest in the controversial preaching emanating from Oxford may have been nurtured in the household of the king's mother, who is known to have been sympathetic to John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384). After her death in 1385 Latimer retired from court altogether, ceasing to play a part in public affairs and turning his attention to religious matters. In May 1388 he was summoned to appear before the king's council &#145;with certain books and quires in his custody&#146;  (McFarlane, 193) said to contain erroneous doctrine contrary to the Catholic faith. No serious consequences appear to have resulted from this interview.<br>
<br>By early 1389 it is evident that Latimer was protecting John Wodard, a Lollard chaplain from Knebworth, Hertfordshire, who preached sermons every Tuesday at Latimer's market at Chipping Warden, Northamptonshire. An emissary of John Buckingham, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1399), made several unsuccessful attempts to serve Wodard with a summons to appear before the bishop, but this only provoked Latimer into suing the bishop's agent for loss of profits from his market. Buckingham responded by invoking the lay power, sending a certificate naming forty-one persons led into heresy by Wodard, some of whom were associates of Latimer.<br>
<br>Latimer's relationship with the other Lollard knights, particularly Sir Lewis Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1404), an overseer of his will, is also telling, as is his patronage of the notorious heretic Robert Hoke, whom either he or his wife presented to the rectory of Braybrooke. On 14 September 1401 Latimer died, and was buried in Braybrooke churchyard. Both he and Dame Anne, who died the following July, left wills in English similar to those of several of their fellow Lollards [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50538/', "Lollard women (act. c.1390&#150;c.1520)")</script>]. They emphasized their unworthiness, forbade funeral pomp, and expressed contempt for their bodies and a biblical concern for the poor. The overseers and executors of Dame Anne's will included Robert Hoke, Sir Lewis Clifford, and two Wycliffite Oxford academics&#151;Robert Lechlade and the reformed Philip Repyndon. At their deaths the Latimer estate&#151;valued, doubtless conservatively, at &pound;120 yearly on Sir Thomas's death&#151;passed to Thomas's younger brother Edward, but Braybrooke remained a centre of heresy for some years to come. In 1405, 1414, and 1425 Robert Hoke, still rector, appeared before church authorities on charges of heresy, abjuring twice, and it is clear that he enjoyed considerable local support. It was undoubtedly he who furnished two Czech scholars with a copy of Wyclif's <span class="italic">De dominio divino</span> at Braybrooke in 1407. Not surprisingly, Braybrooke has been suggested as the location of the Lollard scriptorium that flourished in the east midlands in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.<br>
