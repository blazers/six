<span class="headword">Yeates,  Thomas</span>  (1768&#150;1839), <span class="occ">orientalist and biblical scholar</span>, born on 9 October 1768 at Snow Hill, Holborn, London, was the son of John Yeates, a wood turner, of Snow Hill, and his wife, Jane. He was at first apprenticed to his father but, showing no taste for the trade, was allowed to pursue his studies in Latin and Hebrew, his fondness for which had been noted by his schoolmaster, a Mr Kebble of Shoe Lane. In 1782 the youthful Yeates was appointed secretary to the Society for Constitutional Information, a radical association which numbered William Jones (1746&#150;1794), another oriental scholar, among its members; he was removed from the post in February 1784 after failing to manage the society's finances. Planning to translate the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into biblical Hebrew, he got into communication with the theologian and orientalist Joseph White. Shortly after his appointment as professor of Hebrew at Oxford, White obtained for Yeates a <span class="roman">Bible</span> clerkship at All Souls, whence he matriculated on 22 May 1802 but never graduated. Although he laboured for many years at this translation, and received encouragement from the continent as well as in England, the only portion of it ever published was a specimen which appeared in the third annual report of the London Jews' Society.<br>
<br>From about 1808 to 1815 Yeates was employed by Claudius Buchanan to catalogue and describe the oriental manuscripts brought by him from India; and for much of this period he lived in Cambridge, where the university press published (1812) his &#145;Collation of an India copy of the Pentateuch&#146;; the copies of this work were presented by the press to Yeates. The catalogue appears to be preserved in manuscript in the Cambridge University Library. Other manuscripts and published writings of Yeates are listed in a detailed bibliography by Jean Carmignac in his introduction to the 1982 reprinting of Yeates's revision of Giovanni Battista Iona's Hebrew gospels.<br>
<br>Through Buchanan, Yeates obtained some employment from the Bible Society, and superintended their editions of the psalter and the Syriac <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. After Buchanan's death he was helped by Thomas Burgess (1756&#150;1837), bishop of St David's, who procured for him the secretaryship of the Royal Society of Literature, and in 1823 the post of assistant in the British Museum's printed book department, where he remained until his death. In 1818 he published a work called <span class="italic">Indian Church History</span> (reprinted, 1921), compiled chiefly from Assemani and the reports of Buchanan and Kerr, and containing an account of the Christian churches in the East, with an ultra-conservative history of their origin. In the same year Yeates produced a <span class="italic">Variation chart of all the navigable oceans and seas between latitude 60 degrees N. and S. from documents, and delineated on a new plan</span>; and in 1819 a very faulty Syriac grammar, but the first to appear in English. Yeates was also employed by the publishers of Caleb Ashworth's <span class="italic">Hebrew Grammar</span> to revise the third and subsequent editions. In 1830 he published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Bible chronology, being an essay towards reconciling the same with the histories of the eastern nations</span>; in 1833 <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Antiquity of the Pyramids</span>; and in 1835 <span class="italic">Remarks on the History of Ancient Egypt</span>. His work was judged retrograde and antiquated by the end of the nineteenth century. His astronomical publications involved him in financial difficulties, which the Literary Fund helped him to meet. He was married, but details of his wife are unknown. He died on 7 October 1839.<br>
