</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blount, Sir  Henry</span>  (1602&#150;1682), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born at Tittenhanger, Hertfordshire, on 15 December 1602 and baptized at Ridge, Hertfordshire, on 22 December, son of Thomas (later Sir Thomas) Blount (1556&#150;1639) and Frances Pigot (<i>c</i>.1564&#150;1619). He went to the free school at St Albans and on 30 June 1615 matriculated as a gentleman commoner from Trinity College, Oxford; he graduated BA on 18 June 1618. In 1620 he was admitted to Gray's Inn. According to John Aubrey &#145;he was pretty wild when young, especially addicted to common wenches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 25&#150;7). In early 1629 he wrote a commendatory poem to William D'Avenant's <span class="italic">The Tragedy of Albovine, King of the Lombards</span>, and on 23 September of that year he and William Blount, an Oxfordshire gentleman, were given passes to travel for three years to Spain, France, and Italy. Later he alluded to this first journey in the preface to his account of his 1634 travels in the Levant, <span class="italic">A Voyage into the Levant</span> (1636).<br>
<br>Blount began his account of this journey in Venice, from where he sailed on 7 May 1634 down the Adriatic coast, and then travelled inland into the Balkans. He reached Constantinople and after spending only a few days he crossed to Egypt via Rhodes in the Turkish fleet and docked in Alexandria. He visited the great pyramid in Giza, wandered around the Faiy&ucirc;m, and in November embarked for Palermo, Naples, and finally Venice, having travelled above 6000 miles in eleven months. In the preface Blount declared that his purpose in travelling had been Baconian: to gain knowledge by means of personal&#151;&#145;ocular&#146;&#151;experience without the constraints of national and religious history. He travelled alone to the Middle East because he wanted to describe Islam and the world of the Ottomans in an &#145;empirical rather than religious frame of reference&#146;  (MacLean, 94). He was eager to see and learn from the non-Christian world, and realized that no people were more suitable for study than the &#145;Turkes, who are the only moderne people, great in action&#146;. Blount praised them for their military discipline and social organization, emphasizing their importance for English trade and marvelling at the diversity of religious communities that lived among them. He established such good rapport that he was invited by the coffee drinking pasha to &#145;serve under them going against the Polacke&#146;. Blount declined the offer but declared that King Charles I would have encouraged him because the latter had &#145;a League with the Gran Signior, [and] continually held an Embassadour at his Court, esteeming him the greatest Monarch in the World&#146;  (Blount, 15). Blount was fully aware how attractive the Ottoman world must have seemed to potential Christian converts seeking employment and advancement. <span class="italic">The Voyage</span> shows a sharp and iconoclastic mind. &#145;By your eyes&#146;, wrote Bishop Henry King in commendation of the accuracy and detail of the book,<blockquote>
<div>I here have made my full discoveries;<br>
</div>
<div>And all your countries so exactly seen,<br>
</div>
<div>As in the voyage I had sharer been.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Soon after his return to England, and the publication of his travels, which won recognition from the king, Blount became a gentleman pensioner to Charles I and was knighted on 21 March 1639. He committed himself to the royalist cause and attended the king at York and took part in the battle of Edgehill. He stayed with the king in Oxford, but then went to London, where after entering Westminster Hall with his sword on his side he was questioned by the House of Commons for his apparent royalism. In 1647 he married Hester (<i>c</i>.1620&#150;1678), daughter of Christopher Wase of Upper Holloway, Middlesex, and widow of Sir William Mainwaring of Chester. However, he continued to indulge himself: Henry Neville anonymously published in that year a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Parliament of Ladies</span> in which Blount states that it is &#145;cheaper and safer to lye with common wenches than with ladies of quality&#146;. Aubrey recounts some episodes about Blount's frequenting of bordellos which support that claim while Wood describes him as &#145;a great banterer&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.54).<br>
<br>At the beginning of the interregnum Blount changed sides and in January 1652 Cromwell appointed him to serve on the Hales commission for the reformation of the criminal code. He opposed tithes and urged that no minister of the church be paid more than &pound;100 per annum for &#145;administering the Gospel&#146;. In May 1654 he served as a juror at the trial of the brother of the Portuguese ambassador, Pantaleon Sa, along with three others and an English boy, all of whom were accused of murder in the New Exchange. In November 1655 he was appointed to the trade and navigation committee to &#145;regulate and improve trade, and receive propositions for the benefit thereof&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.: Commonwealth</span>, 2). Two years later he wrote a foreword to Walter Rumsey's <span class="italic">Organon salutis</span>, the first detailed account in English of coffee, that &#145;physick&#146; which the Turks use for preventing &#145;Consumption&#146; and &#145;Lethargie&#146;, &#145;Rickets in Children&#146;, and &#145;Stone and Gout&#146;. Judge Rumsey, whose letter to Blount appeared in the dedication, credited Blount with popularizing coffee in the country: &#145;your discovery in your excellent Book of Travels, hath brought the use of the Turkes Physick, of Cophie in great request in England&#146;. Blount, who was known to drink only water, became an inveterate drinker of coffee, frequenting numerous coffee houses in London. John Evelyn, who met him in 1659, described him as the &#145;famous traveller and water-drinker&#146;. Blount declaimed against drunkenness, and against the universities, which in his view corrupted the youth. But he also had his humorous side: Aubrey thought him &#145;a great shammer&#146;, telling falsities for the pleasure of it all. He was known not to urge his servants to church, preferring them to attend executions at Tyburn, &#145;which work more upon them than all the oratory in the sermons&#146;.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Blount supported the new king and in 1661 he became sheriff of Hertfordshire. He remained in Tittenhanger, where Nathaniel Vincent served him as chaplain, spending his time in book collecting and writing. In November 1678 his wife died, and in September 1682, while on a visit to London, he became ill; he returned to Tittenhanger, where he died on the morning of 9 October 1682. He was buried two days later. Four of his children survived him: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2698/', "Thomas (later Sir Thomas) Pope Blount (1649&#150;1697)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2684/', "Charles Blount (1654&#150;1693)")</script>, Frances (1648&#150;1699), and Ulysses (1664&#150;1704).<br>
