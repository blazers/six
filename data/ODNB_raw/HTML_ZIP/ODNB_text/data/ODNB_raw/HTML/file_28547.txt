<span class="headword">Wallace,  William Vincent</span>  (1812&#150;1865), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at Waterford, Ireland, on 11 March 1812, the first of the three children of Sergeant William Wallace, a Scot, who was bandmaster of the 29th or Worcestershire regiment. As a child, instructed in music by his father, he learned to play many instruments, including piano, violin, clarinet, and guitar. In 1825 his father was discharged from the army and the family moved to Dublin, where the elder Wallace apparently played bassoon in the orchestra of the Theatre Royal. His two sons, William and Wellington, played violin and flute respectively in the same orchestra, and William sometimes deputized for the leader, James Barton. During these years William studied piano with W. S. Conran and organ with Haydn Corri. He was appointed organist of the Roman Catholic cathedral of Thurles in 1830 and professor of music at Thurles Ursuline convent. He sought the hand of Isabella Kelly (<i>d</i>. 1900), one of his pupils at the convent, and, to gain her father's consent, converted to Roman Catholicism in 1830, taking the additional name of Vincent, which he thereafter used as his principal Christian name. The marriage took place the following year, and in August 1831 the couple returned together to Dublin, where Wallace rejoined the theatre orchestra. Paganini's visit to Dublin stimulated him greatly. In May 1834 he made his d&eacute;but as a composer and violinist, playing his own concerto at a concert of the Anacreontic Society.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1835 Wallace left Liverpool on a ship bound for Van Diemen's Land with his wife, his son, William, and his sister-in-law Anna Kelly. On 31 October they arrived in Hobart, where Wallace gave a number of concerts, and in January 1836 they moved to Sydney, where he began to establish himself as a performer of note. At a concert given under the patronage of the governor of New South Wales, Sir Richard Bourke, at the Royal Hotel on 12 February he played a piano concerto by Herz and a violin concerto by Mayseder. His performances, particularly on the violin, excited the awe of the Australian press. In the wake of several successful concerts, together with his wife and his sister, Eliza (1814&#150;1879), who was an accomplished singer, on 4 April 1836 he founded an academy of music for the instruction of young ladies in Bridge Street. He may also have been involved in sheep farming but this remains uncertain. Within two years he had run up debts of nearly &pound;2000 and, abandoning his family, set sail from Sydney on 11 February 1838. His wife and child probably returned to Ireland shortly afterwards. An improbable tale of adventures, involving Maori cannibals and tiger hunting during a three- or four-month journey to Chile via New Zealand and India, is colourfully related by Berlioz in his <span class="italic">Les soir&eacute;es de l'orchestre</span> (1853), apparently on the basis of information supplied by Wallace. He was certainly in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile, by 3 June 1838, when he gave a concert on violin and piano. During the next five years he slowly made his way northwards, visiting Buenos Aires, Lima, Jamaica, Cuba, and Mexico. In Mexico City he conducted the opera season of 1841 and composed a mass for the cathedral. He then proceeded to New Orleans (1841), Philadelphia (1842), Boston (1843), and New York, where his d&eacute;but at the Apollo Saloon on 6 June established him as a leading figure in New York's musical society; he astonished his listeners by playing his own brilliant <span class="italic">Introduction and Variations on La Cracovienne</span> on either violin or piano. In 1844, having reputedly lost a fortune by poor investments, he left for Europe. After a period in Germany and the Low Countries he arrived in London, where he performed as a pianist at the Hanover Square Rooms on 8 May 1845.<br>
<br>It was only at this point that Wallace's public career as a composer began in earnest, after the veteran librettist Edward Fitzball, to whom he had been introduced by an old Dublin friend, Heyward St Leger, invited him to set his latest text. The result of their collaboration was the opera <span class="italic">Maritana</span>, written in a very short time (probably incorporating much musical material from Wallace's earlier unpublished compositions) and produced under Alfred Bunn's direction at Drury Lane on 15 November 1845. It gained immediate and decisive success with a public and press that was already intrigued by tales of Wallace's exotic adventures, and came to rival Balfe's <span class="italic">The Bohemian Girl</span> (1843) in popularity. A major reason for its success was its eclectic yet at the same time vigorous and inventive musical idiom, so different from that of the conventional English operas of the time; Wallace's musical styles ranged from the robust sumptuousness of Meyerbeerian grand opera, through the gentle melancholy of Chopin, to the intriguing unfamiliarity of Spanish-American popular music; this occasioned the critic of <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, H. F. Chorley, to observe that Wallace was &#145;in search of a style, since there are half-a-dozen different manners tried in as many portions of the opera&#146;, but such sophisticated quibbles hardly troubled the average listener, who enjoyed a succession of stirring and memorable pieces. <span class="italic">Maritana</span> also shared with <span class="italic">The Bohemian Girl</span> the distinction of being one of the very few English operas to obtain recognition abroad; it was produced in Vienna, Hamburg, and Prague as well as in far-flung places in the English-speaking world such as Sydney and Cape Town. Though it did not gain such a decisive place in the repertory as Balfe's opera, it continued to be performed in England well into the twentieth century. It has been suggested by Nicholas Temperley in the <span class="italic">New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span> that Wallace's unorthodox harmonies were directly derived from genuine Spanish-American folk music and that, in this aspect of the opera, may have had a direct influence on Bizet's <span class="italic">Carmen</span>.<br>
<br>Bunn hoped to follow up the success of <span class="italic">Maritana</span> with Wallace's next opera, <span class="italic">Matilda of Hungary</span>, to Bunn's own libretto, which the composer had set to music in a more ambitious grand opera style. However, when produced at Drury Lane on 22 February 1847, it was coolly received, largely on account of the banal libretto. Wallace almost immediately began work on a new opera, <span class="italic">Lurline</span>, to a libretto by Fitzball, based on the Loreley legend. It was announced for performance at the Paris Op&eacute;ra and at Covent Garden in 1848, but did not reach the stage; it seems probable that, on account of serious eye trouble, Wallace failed to complete the score in time. Abandoning composition for a while he sailed for Brazil in 1849 and, after an eight-month stay there, made his way to New York. In 1850, having apparently obtained advice that his marriage to Isabella Kelly was invalid because he had been under age at the time and &#145;bred up a Protestant&#146;, he married an American pianist, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Stoepel (<i>d</i>. 1885), who had made her New York d&eacute;but on 16 June 1850; she appeared in concert programmes from January 1851 as Mrs Wallace.<br>
<br>For much of the 1850s Wallace's activities are largely uncertain. He may have returned to England in 1853, and it has been suggested that <span class="italic">Lurline</span> was staged in Germany as <span class="italic">Loreley</span> in 1854, though no firm evidence has so far come to light. In the same year he experienced the first symptoms of the heart disease that was eventually to cause his death. He is known to have been in Germany between September 1858 and January 1859, whence he probably travelled to London, and here, on 18 March 1859, he assigned the copyright of <span class="italic">Lurline</span> to the Pyne&#150;Harrison Opera Company, which produced it at Covent Garden on 23 February 1860. Later in 1860 he revisited New York, where extracts from his latest opera were performed at a reception held in his honour. The success of <span class="italic">Lurline</span>, though not as great as that of <span class="italic">Maritana</span>, was considerable, especially with those critics who approved of Wallace's greater reliance on their favourite German models, such as Weber and Mendelssohn. The opera was extended to the end of the season and eventually earned some &pound;50,000 for the company, though Wallace, who had sold the copyright for 10<i>s</i>., did not benefit financially. Nevertheless, encouraged by the critical reception of <span class="italic">Lurline</span>, he immediately set to work on a new opera, <span class="italic">The Amber Witch</span>, to a libretto by Chorley, which was brought out in a rather inadequate production at Her Majesty's Theatre on 28 February 1861. The critics again were favourable, and a late twentieth-century commentator has described it as the work in which &#145;Wallace's style reached its full maturity&#146;  (Burton, &#145;Wallace&#146;). Wallace himself regarded <span class="italic">The Amber Witch</span> as his finest work, but the public was lukewarm. He continued his attempt to interest the London public in English grand opera with <span class="italic">Love's Triumph</span>, to a libretto by Planch&eacute;, produced at Covent Garden on 3 November 1862; however, the production had only a short run. His last completed opera, <span class="italic">The Desert Flower</span>, received its premi&egrave;re at Covent Garden on 12 October 1863, but, like the previous two operas, achieved no more than a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>. Wallace was working on a new opera, <span class="italic">Estrella</span>, in 1864 when he again became seriously ill with heart trouble, in consequence of which he retired to Passy near Paris, where he was visited by Rossini and other notable musicians. His condition deteriorated, and in September 1865 he travelled to the Ch&acirc;teau de Haget, at Vieuzos in the Pyrenees, with his wife, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, who nursed him through his final illness. He died on 12 October 1865 and his body was transported back to London, where it was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 23 October.<br>
