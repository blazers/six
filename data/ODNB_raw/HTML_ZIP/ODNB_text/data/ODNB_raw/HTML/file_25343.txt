<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sheppard,  John <span class="st"> [Jack]</span></span>  (1702&#150;1724), <span class="occ">thief and prison-breaker</span>, was born on 4 March 1702 in White Row, Spitalfields, London, the son of Thomas Sheppard (1672&#150;<i>c</i>.1706), carpenter, and his wife, Mary. His father, reputedly an honest, industrious artisan, died young, leaving three children. John, known as Jack, together with an elder brother, Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1697), received a rudimentary education at Mr Garrett's school, near St Helen's, Bishopsgate. In or soon after 1714 Jack was employed as a servant by William Kneebone, a woollen draper, at the sign of the Angel on the north side of the Strand, opposite St Mary's Church. Kneebone was kind to the boy. He improved him in his writing and accounts and, on 2 April 1717, apprenticed him to Owen Wood, a carpenter in Drury Lane. Sheppard is said to have been a talented apprentice. However, in 1722 one Joseph Hayne, a button-mould maker who lived next door to Sheppard's master, gave up his trade to take the Black Lion alehouse in Lewkenor's Lane, hard by, and he encouraged Sheppard and other apprentices to patronize the house. It was at the Black Lion that Sheppard was introduced to &#145;a train of vices as before I was altogether a stranger to&#146;  (<span class="italic">Narrative</span>, 5&#150;6). There he also met and became enamoured of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62078/', "Elizabeth Lyon (fl. 1722&#150;1726)")</script>, a prostitute who became his mistress and induced him to steal.<br>
<br>Sheppard's first known theft was from the Rummer tavern, Charing Cross. Sent there to do a job for his master, Sheppard stole two silver spoons. In August 1723, after further thefts, he absconded from his master and drifted into a life of professional crime. In February 1724 Sheppard was committing burglaries with his brother Thomas and Elizabeth Lyon. This partnership was short-lived. Thomas was apprehended at the beginning of April and informed against his accomplices. Shortly afterwards Jack himself was taken. He was lodged for the night in the parish roundhouse of St Giles-in-the-Fields, but within two hours had escaped by breaking a hole through the roof. It was the first of a series of daring and skilful escapes from captivity. On 25 May he effected a remarkable escape from New prison in Clerkenwell. Sheppard was held, together with Lyon, in the Newgate ward, said to be the strongest apartment in the gaol, but after he had sawed through his fetters and removed an oak muntin and an iron bar from the window the couple descended 25 feet to the yard below by means of a rope fashioned from a sheet, a blanket, and Lyon's gown and petticoat, and then surmounted a 22 foot perimeter wall. In the summer of 1724, with the footpad Joseph Blake (alias Blueskin), Sheppard experimented with highway robbery on the Hampstead Road. He also committed fresh burglaries, including one upon the house of his former benefactor William Kneebone on the night of 12&#150;13 July. By this time, however, his activities had attracted the attention of the famous receiver and thief-taker Jonathan Wild, and his unwillingness to submit his booty to Wild's disposal had antagonized the thief-taker. Wild effected Sheppard's arrest in Rosemary Lane on 23 July and he was committed to Newgate prison in the City of London. He was brought to trial at the Old Bailey in August and, largely upon the strength of evidence procured by Wild, convicted of the Kneebone robbery and sentenced to death.<br>
<br>On 31 August, four days before the time appointed for his execution, Sheppard sawed through one of the iron spikes surmounting the door of the condemned hold in Newgate and, by squeezing through the gap in the remaining spikes, escaped from the hold into the Lodge, the prison's reception area. From thence, disguised in a nightgown and assisted by Elizabeth Lyon and another woman, he passed through the Lodge and out the main door. This exploit was the talk of London, but Sheppard's period of freedom was brief. Lyon was apprehended the day after the escape and remained in custody until after Sheppard's execution. Sheppard fled the capital, but after a brief sojourn in Wavendon, Buckinghamshire, returned to London and was recaptured on Finchley Common on 10 September by a posse of Newgate turnkeys. Returned to the condemned hold, he immediately began to plan another escape. On 16 September, after a set of tools had been found concealed in the rushes of his chair, he was moved to a formidable fourth-storey apartment known as the Castle, where he was isolated from other prisoners and where visitors were carefully watched. He was also fettered and handcuffed, and his fetters were secured to an iron staple in the floor by a great horse padlock.<br>
<br>Despite these precautions, Sheppard accomplished his last and most spectacular escape on 15 October. After freeing himself from his handcuffs and breaking the chain of his fetters, he removed an iron bar from the chimney. Then, climbing up the chimney, he broke into the Red Room, directly above the Castle, and from thence, in a hugely impressive display of ingenuity, strength, and determination, worked his way to the upper leads, mastering the locks, bolts, and bars of six strong doors in his progress. He was now on the summit of the gaol, more than 60 feet above Newgate Street, but had to return to his cell for his blanket before letting himself down upon the house of William Bird, a turner, adjoining the prison. After entering Bird's house by a garret window, he stole down the stairs and left the house by the street door. The irons carried off by Sheppard were subsequently recovered at a lodging belonging to Catherine Cook (<i>fl</i>. 1717&#150;1724), another of his mistresses, in Cranbourn Alley, Leicester Fields. On the night of 29&#150;30 October Sheppard burgled a pawnbroker's shop in Drury Lane. It was his last robbery. Handsomely attired in some of the plundered finery, he was arrested, very drunk, in a Drury Lane brandy shop on 31 October. Crowds of people now flocked to Newgate to see him, among them Sir James Thornhill, serjeant-painter to the crown, who sketched portraits of him in the Middle Stone Room and the condemned hold. By 7 November the turnkeys were said to have earned more than &pound;200 charging fees to visitors. On 10 November Sheppard was brought before the court of king's bench, Westminster, where a rule of court was ordered for his execution six days hence. He was watched day and night, and on 16 November 1724 was executed at Tyburn before one of the largest crowds Londoners could then remember. He was buried the same day in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields. His brother Thomas was transported to Maryland in 1725.<br>
<br>Sheppard's exploits inspired pamphlets, ballads, engravings, and plays, and one clergyman is said to have exhorted his flock to emulate Sheppard in a spiritual sense by mounting the &#145;chimney of hope&#146; to the &#145;leads of divine meditation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Select Trials</span>, 1.445&#150;6). John Thurmond's <span class="italic">Harlequin Sheppard</span> played to &#145;vast applause&#146; at Drury Lane in December 1724  (<span class="italic">Parker's London News</span>, 7 Dec 1724), and <span class="italic">The Prison-Breaker</span>, published in 1725 and intended for Lincoln's Inn Fields, was altered by Thomas Walker in 1728 and performed at Bartholomew fair as <span class="italic">The Quaker's Opera</span>. There is little reason to suppose that John Gay's Macheath was directly modelled upon Sheppard, but it is highly probable that the popular excitement generated by his escapes, and by the trial of Jonathan Wild in 1725, was a major factor in persuading Gay to develop Jonathan Swift's suggestion of a &#145;Newgate pastoral&#146; into <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> (1728). Sheppard's fame was revived in 1839 by William Harrison Ainsworth's best-selling romance <span class="italic">Jack Sheppard</span>, illustrated by some of George Cruikshank's best cuts. Ainsworth's triumph inspired many imitative romances and innumerable stage plays and aroused &#145;respectable&#146; fears that unwary youths might be led into crime by a desire to imitate Sheppard. &#145;Public morality and public decency&#146;, wrote John Forster, &#145;have rarely been more endangered than by the trumpeted exploits of Jack Sheppard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Examiner</span>, 3 Nov 1839). Moved by such considerations, successive lord chamberlains refused to license plays entitled <span class="italic">Jack Sheppard</span> for nearly forty years after 1840, but the ban was not strictly enforced outside London, and even there theatre managers frequently circumvented it by producing Sheppard plays under neutral titles like <span class="italic">The Idle Apprentice</span> and <span class="italic">Old London</span>. In 1886 the actress Nellie Farren enjoyed great success playing Jack in William Yardley and Henry Pottinger Stephens's burlesque, <span class="italic">Little Jack Sheppard</span>, staged at London's Gaiety Theatre, but thereafter Sheppard's popular fame, and hence the emotive power of his name, declined. During the twentieth century, nevertheless, his career continued to inspire writers and dramatists. Paramount's lavish but commercially unsuccessful <span class="italic">Where's Jack?</span> (1969), directed by James Clavell and starring Tommy Steele as Jack and Sir Stanley Baker as Jonathan Wild, was the last of three cinematic versions of the story.<br>
<br>The notice for Sheppard's arrest after his escape from the Castle described him as &#145;about 22 years old, about five foot four inches high, very slender, of a pale complexion, has an impediment or hesitation in his speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 20 Oct 1724). Although Sheppard's talents as a prison-breaker were undoubtedly extraordinary his personal character has occasioned much dispute. The available evidence suggests that he was neither Ainsworth's dashing hero nor John Langbein's &#145;nasty thug&#146;  (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 11 Oct 1991) but a mixture of worthy as well as unworthy qualities. His robberies were characterized by adroitness and skill rather than violence, and his courage, his loyalty to companions, and his cheery if impudent disposition lend some colour to popular portrayals of him as a likeable rogue. It cannot be said of him, on the other hand, that his crimes were prompted by necessity, and he became a persistent and&#151;as the Kneebone robbery demonstrated&#151;undiscriminating thief.<br>
