<span class="headword">Smith,  (Margaret) Patricia  Hornsby-</span>, Baroness Hornsby-Smith  (1914&#150;1985), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 17 March 1914 at 315 Upper Richmond Road, East Sheen, near Richmond, Surrey, the only daughter and second child of Frederick Charles Hornsby-Smith (<i>d</i>. 1944), saddler and master umbrella maker, and his wife, Ellen Florence, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Minter. She was educated at Richmond county school; after leaving school Patricia, or Pat (as she was known), embarked upon a secretarial career.<br>
<br>Hornsby-Smith displayed a precociously active interest in politics. In 1930 at sixteen she joined the Junior Imperial League. In the following year the Conservative Party included her in its team of speakers in the general election campaign. Her youth and gender made her contribution quite unusual: many women helped the party but normally as back-room or front lawn supporters; a girl of only seventeen holding forth on a party platform would have been a remarkable sight. It was not, moreover, a general election in which the Conservatives needed to scrape the barrel for supporters; indeed, although she had joined the party when it was in opposition, it dominated British politics for much of the rest of her life.<br>
<br>For ten years Hornsby-Smith worked as a private secretary in engineering, electrical, and textile firms; she also worked for an employers' federation. The outbreak of the Second World War drew her, like many other women, into voluntary work. She helped to organize a comforts fund for service personnel and to run a Women's Voluntary Services canteen; she was also joint organizer of the National Savings Campaign, and a member of the Barnes war efforts committee. In 1941 she became principal private secretary to Lord Selborne, minister of economic warfare. Her move to Whitehall was part of the government's drive to bring more women into government for the duration of the war, although there was discontent among professional women who felt that their skills were undervalued and underused. The Ministry of Economic Warfare had overall responsibility for the Special Operations Executive (SOE), where women were deployed at all levels&#151;from agents in the field to wireless operators, administrators, and, of course, secretaries. After the war she maintained her links with SOE by joining the Special Forces Club.<br>
<br>Hornsby-Smith was, meanwhile, building up her experience within the Conservative Party. She helped to organize the Surrey Young Conservatives and acted as their chair as well as chair of the Young Conservatives in the south-east area. It was regarded as especially important to attract a new generation into the party. In 1945 she was elected to Barnes borough council, and served as a councillor until 1949, sitting on the predictable committees for a woman such as housing, education, electricity, maternity and child welfare, and nursery, as well as the less predictable ones of finance and general purposes, and library. Between 1947 and 1950 she also sat on the Conservative Party's executive committee. In 1946 she attracted wide attention among Conservatives when she gave a fiery address to the annual conference, where the party was still recovering after the shock (for most people) defeat at the general election the previous year.<br>
<br>For a woman to gain adoption as a prospective parliamentary candidate was difficult, especially in a constituency where there was a chance of winning. Hornsby-Smith was repeatedly rejected, at least on one occasion explicitly because she was a woman. Not surprisingly she believed that selection committees were the &#145;most potent citadel of prejudice&#146; in all the parties, and that women had to be better than all the men to be selected.<br>
<br>Once adopted for Chislehurst in Kent, Hornsby-Smith's drive revitalized the constituency, and in 1950 she successfully contested the seat in the general election. As a constituency MP she was hard-working and effective at dealing with constituents, and she increased her majority at each general election during the 1950s. Although it had not been easy for her to break into national politics the party was quick to make use of a new, young, attractive, redhead woman MP. In 1951 she made the women MPs' BBC party political broadcast to woo women voters in the general election, focusing on the cost of living and housing. Her broadcast was generally thought to have been an improvement on Florence Horsbrugh's performance the previous year.<br>
<br>Hornsby-Smith was quickly spotted for a government post. In 1951 she was appointed parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Health where she remained for six years. From 1957 to 1959 she was parliamentary under-secretary at the Home Office, and from 1959 to 1961 joint parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. In 1959 she became a privy councillor. She was the youngest woman ever appointed to government and to the privy council&#151;not that the competition for these accolades was very great as there had been so few women ministers&#151;but despite holding a variety of posts for over a decade she never achieved a cabinet post, and was, therefore, never in a policy making position. She was not highly rated by the civil servants at the Ministry of Health, who thought her appointment was a token gesture to increase the number of women in government to two; she was too nervous and inexperienced, and too much of a party politician; but as women ministers often faced hostility from civil servants it is hard to know whether they were making an objective judgement or articulating their prejudice. Conservative prime ministers thought it desirable to have women ministers but, after Florence Horsbrugh's short and sad spell in Churchill's cabinet, not women in cabinet. Her ministerial career ended in 1961 when she was created a dame of the British empire. Her parliamentary career was also interrupted when, as a result of changes in the composition of her Chislehurst constituency and especially the growth of council estates within its boundaries, she lost the seat to Labour in 1966.<br>
<br>Writing in 1968 Hornsby-Smith reflected that the lot of a woman MP was not a happy one. She described not only the difficulty of selection but also the awkward lifestyle, parliamentary conditions, the domestic constraints, meagre salary and costs of nursing a constituency, the way in which women MPs were expected to restrict themselves in debate to certain subjects, and the problems inherent in received notions of domesticity. Such comments have frequently been made; what would have been more interesting would have been her views&#151;as a woman who remained a minister for a decade but never made the leap into cabinet&#151;on the difficulties for women ministers. Perhaps because she was never promoted to the cabinet she was deeply conscious of the prejudice against women in all the parties.<br>
<br>Although Hornsby-Smith faced hostility in the Chislehurst constituency she was readopted after an emotional outburst at a party meeting, and in 1970 she regained the seat. In the early 1970s boundary changes meant that the constituency was carved up, and she stepped aside so that Edward Heath could stand in the newly formed Bexley and Sidcup constituency that now incorporated part of Chislehurst. In February 1974 she unsuccessfully contested Aldridge&#150;Brownhills in the midlands.<br>
<br>This defeat marked the end of Hornsby-Smith's House of Commons career and in May 1974 she was created Baroness Hornsby-Smith. She played an active part in the House of Lords for a number of years, despite ill health. Throughout her political career she maintained her wartime interest in voluntary work. She worked for the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council for Research as chair of the appeals committee from 1966, and from 1974 vice-chair of the council; from 1975 she chaired the Electrical Association of Women, and from 1983 the St Edward's Housing Association. Her appointment to company directorships in the 1960s renewed her earlier interests in industry: as chairman of the Western and General Unit Trust, launched in April 1964 to invest mainly in west of England companies, she became the first woman chairman of a unit trust. She also travelled widely: in 1958 she was a delegate to the United Nations; in 1962 she led a parliamentary delegation to Australasia and another in 1972 to Kenya.<br>
<br>Although she never reached the cabinet Hornsby-Smith was a relatively well-known politician: as a woman MP, minister, and then member of the House of Lords she inevitably stood out among the men, and she was known to a wider public through contributing to the BBC radio programme <span class="italic">Any Questions?</span> From 1971 she was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. She belonged to the Constitutional, Special Forces, and Cowdrey clubs. She died, unmarried, on 3 July 1985. A memorial service held on 29 October 1985 at St Margaret's, Westminster, was attended by her brother's family and numerous politicians, including the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, who read one of the lessons.<br>
