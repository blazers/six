<span class="headword">Onslow,  Richard</span>, first Baron Onslow  (1654&#150;1717), <span class="occ">speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born on 23 June 1654, the eldest son of Sir Arthur Onslow, second baronet (1622&#150;1688), politician, of Knowle and West Clandon, Surrey, and his wife, Mary, second daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas Foot, first baronet, mayor of London. He matriculated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 7 June 1671, and was admitted to the Inner Temple three years later, but was never called to the bar. He married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1661, <i>d</i>. 1718), the daughter and heir of Sir Henry Tulse, grocer, of Lothbury, London, on 31 August 1676. They had three sons and one daughter. The Onslow family were well established in the political life of Surrey and Sir Richard's career benefited from these foundations. On 1 March 1679 he entered parliament for the borough of Guildford and supported attempts to exclude the Roman Catholic duke of York from the throne, voting for the first <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>. Despite the later tory reaction he retained his seat in 1685. Following his father's death, on 21 July 1688, he succeeded to the baronetcy and as a mark of his new status was returned for one of the Surrey county seats in the Convention Parliament of 1689.<br>
<br>Onslow was later described by his nephew, Sir Arthur Onslow, as<blockquote>a person of great probity, courage and honour &hellip; tall and very thin, not well shaped and with a face exceeding plain, yet there was a certain sweetness with a dignity in his countenance and so much of life and spirit in it that no one who saw him ever thought him of a disagreeable aspect. (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 489)</blockquote>His staunch and consistent country whig sympathies made him the victim of some mockery. The first earl of Dartmouth, a moderate tory, described Onslow as a &#145;vain trifling man of a ridiculous figure, full of party zeal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 5.395n.). He also gained the unwelcome sobriquet Stiff Dick as a result of his rigorous devotion to principle.<br>
<br>He was an active back-bencher during the 1690s and served as one of the commissioners of the Admiralty from May 1690 to February 1693. Onslow's political activity was frequently related to commercial affairs and country issues such as disbandment of the armed forces, regulation of elections, and the number of placemen in the Commons. As a consequence of this activity he was nominated as a moderate whig candidate for the speakership in February 1701, but was defeated by Robert Harley. The same year, in another indication of his increasing status, he became high steward of Guildford.<br>
<br>Onslow gained the speaker's chair in the 1708 parliament. Unfortunately his whiggish zeal was unabated and his inability to pretend any kind of neutrality in the chair lost him the goodwill of moderates and tories alike. He was diligent, even pedantic, as a speaker, and very conscious of his role as a defender of the rights of the Commons. He played a significant part in the trial of the high-church clergyman Dr Henry Sacheverell, and on 23 March 1710 led the Commons to the House of Lords to hear the judgment in the case. This resulted in Onslow's successfully challenging black rod on a matter of privilege which, although it increased his unpopularity with the tories, did not prevent his elevation to the privy council on 15 June 1710. The tide of tory support proved so strong in the 1710 election that Onslow lost his Surrey seat and was forced to sit for St Mawes, Cornwall, on Godolphin's recommendation. The tories &#145;thought there could not be a greater mark of an universal disaffection to the Whig cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 492).<br>
<br>On the death of Queen Anne, Onslow supported the protestant succession and gained a strong position at court. In October 1714 he became chancellor of the exchequer and after resigning from office a year later he was given a tellership of the exchequer on 4 November 1715 for life. On 19 June 1716 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Onslow of Onslow, Shropshire, and of Clandon, Surrey, and the following month (6 July) he was appointed lord lieutenant of Surrey.<br>
<br>Onslow died of fever on 5 December 1717 at Soho Square, London, and was buried on 13 December at Merrow, Surrey. His estate passed to his eldest son, Thomas.<br>
