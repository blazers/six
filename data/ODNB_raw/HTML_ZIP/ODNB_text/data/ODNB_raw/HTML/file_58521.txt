<span class="headword">Freeman,  Flora Lucy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1869, <em>d.</em> 1960), <span class="occ">philanthropist and writer</span>, was baptized on 20 May 1869 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the daughter of William Henry Freeman, a general medical practitioner, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carrack. She had at least four older brothers. She founded and organized clubs for working-class girls and a pioneering Roman Catholic Girl Guide company, and wrote advice manuals about these activities. She was also the author of three moral tales, three devotional books, and three moral advice books for girls. Her childhood memories included hating needlework but also &#145;the joy&#146; of reading Scott's novels aloud to her old nurse  (Freeman, <span class="italic">God's Golden Gifts</span>, 58). Her books, notably <span class="italic">A Chain of Thought for the Church's Year</span> (1905), which cites authors as diverse as Isaac Williams, Jeremy Taylor, Matthew Arnold, and Cardinal Newman, indicate that she was well read, if not well educated, and had travelled in Europe. Unmarried, she dedicated <span class="italic">A Chain of Thought</span> to her &#145;dear mother&#146;, and wrote of the &#145;gift of friendship&#146;  (Freeman, <span class="italic">God's Golden Gifts</span>, 65&#150;79).<br>
<br>Freeman, who had been brought up a high-church Anglican, started her work with clubs for working-class girls when aged twenty-one, in London, where she was living. By 1901 she had also run clubs for &#145;rough girls&#146; and laundry workers in a &#145;large seaside town&#146;, as well as an &#145;Evening Home for Rough Girls&#146; in London for many years  (Freeman, <span class="italic">Religious and Social Work</span>, 70&#150;85, 90&#150;93). In 1903 she dedicated <span class="italic">The Sunshine of Everyday Life</span> &#145;to my many girl friends, especially those belonging to St Saviour's Pimlico, and St Barnabas' Hove&#146;.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Religious and Social Work Amongst Girls</span> (1901) Freeman drew on her own extensive experience to give practical advice to girls of the &#145;upper and leisured classes&#146; as to how to run working-girls' clubs. In her view, their primary aim was religious, and her advice about how to introduce the subject, and give religious instruction (in the Anglo-Catholic tradition), suggests that she was a gifted teacher. She also advised on how to find a suitable room, organize enjoyable activities, and finance such clubs, noting that &#145;Our (annual) London Club sale&#146; (staffed by club committee girls) &#145;is always most successful&#146;  (p. 142). The sections on visiting indicate that Freeman took a personal interest in her club members. She referred to district visiting in south London slums, in &#145;one of the poorest of our London riverside parishes&#146;  (p. 90), to visiting a south London women's settlement, and to working in the East End, besides helping with church missions.<br>
<br>Freeman urged upper- and middle-class girls that it would bring them real happiness to use their talents and energy for the good of the poor. The dedication of the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Polly: a Study of Girl Life</span> (1904) to &#145;S. A. D. In Remembrance of Many Happy days spent together in the East End&#146; suggests she did find this herself, although she described her virtual &#145;agony of shyness&#146; when beginning conversations about religion  (Freeman, <span class="italic">Religious and Social Work</span>, 28). While she believed that working-class girls would benefit from the refining influence of the upper classes, the latter were admonished as to the need for understanding, tact, and sensitivity and reminded how much they could learn. A review of <span class="italic">Religious and Social Work</span> in 1909 by &#145;E. E. O&#146; stated that &#145;Every page is a record of living experience. No detail is too insignificant for careful and deliberate attention, and we can well believe this is the secret of Miss Freeman's wonderful success in being a friend to working girls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Girls' Club Journal</span>, 1/1, 1909, 21).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Our Working Girls and How to Help Them</span> (1908), written after seven more years of work with girls' clubs, was also favourably reviewed. In it, Freeman admitted that experience had tempered her optimism, but she reiterated the value of such clubs as a place to give working girls recreation after a hard day's work, and to prevent them from &#145;falling&#146;, through having nowhere to go in their time off. Club workers were advised to help girls find the best kind of work available and to assist those who were being exploited in service. This book discussed issues such as possible difficulties with other club workers and ways to encourage purity, including how to teach the facts of life. Her article &#145;Notes for a lesson on purity&#146; was printed in the <span class="italic">Girls' Club Journal</span> of 1912.<br>
<br>Freeman clearly had links with extensive networks of voluntary organizations, such as the Factory Girls' Country Holiday Fund, preventive homes and penitentiaries, and the National Vigilance Association. <span class="italic">The Patience of Perla</span> (1906) was dedicated to &#145;my dear friend, Grace Valentine Stephenson&#146;, club leader of St Mary's girls' club, Southwark, in 1913, and of the Girls' Guild, Kingsway Hall, from 1913 to 1916. In 1917 and 1921 Stephenson was secretary of the London Girls' Club Union, founded by the Hon. Maude Stanley in 1880.<br>
<br>In 1906 Freeman established the Brighton Girls' Club Union, a non-denominational association, initiated by approaching the vicar of each parish, and also the local rabbi. The aim was to bring together those working with girls in the area for mutual support, and to raise the standard of club work by holding annual competitions. Her account of this was printed in the <span class="italic">Girls' Club Journal</span> of October 1909, presumably as a model for others. She was still secretary in 1917 (but not in 1921). By 1917, with eleven other regional unions, the Brighton union was affiliated to the Federation of Working Girls' Clubs, founded as the Factory Helpers' Union in 1886.<br>
<br>Freeman's books note the influence of Maria Havergal, the daughter of an evangelical clergyman, but primarily of (often controversial) ritualist slum parsons. <span class="italic">Religious and Social Work</span> was dedicated to &#145;The Revd Father Black, to whom I owe so much in my Endeavours to Serve my Sisters&#146;, almost certainly William Black, curate of St Saviour's, Pimlico, from 1892 to 1910, who had been a Cowley Father. The preface was by the Revd R. R. Dolling, vicar of St Saviour's, Poplar, from 1898 to 1902, previously at St Agatha's, Portsea, whose sermons and retreats she had attended, and who was clearly in sympathy with Freeman's work. While slightly poking fun at inexperienced curates, Freeman paid tribute to the effective ministry and &#145;faithful friendship&#146; of some experienced &#145;Priests&#146; (Freeman, <span class="italic">God's Golden Gifts</span>, 70, 72; <span class="italic">Religious and Social Work</span>, 74, 113, 130). <span class="italic">The Clouds of Life</span> (1911) was dedicated &#145;by special permission&#146; to another controversial London Anglo-Catholic, the Revd Arthur Stanton.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Sunshine of Everyday Life</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">The Clouds of Life</span> were addressed to the girls themselves, and contained rigorous advice about religious practice and moral behaviour. Like <span class="italic">Polly</span>, they were enthusiastically prefaced by the Revd C. H. Sharpe, Anglican diocesan missioner in Gloucester from 1893, who became a Roman Catholic in 1916. <span class="italic">A Chain of Thought for the Church's Year</span> (1905) and <span class="italic">The Patience of Perla</span> (1906), a tale of an exemplary working-class girl, set in a seaside town, were prefaced by Anglo-Catholic Brighton clergy, including the Revd Arthur Cocks, who by 1913 was the Roman Catholic priest of Hove. In 1911 and 1917 Freeman's address was 10 Cromwell Road, and in 1923, 3 Ranelagh Villas, both in Hove.<br>
<br>By 1916, when <span class="italic">Spiritual Papers</span> and <span class="italic">God's Golden Gifts</span> were published, Freeman had clearly become a Roman Catholic. She wrote of the &#145;gift&#146; of conversion, and compared the chaotic state of the Anglican church with the certainties offered by the Church of Rome. The preface to the latter work was by Monsignor Hugh Benson (1871&#150;1914), another convert.<br>
<br>In 1916 Freeman initiated Roman Catholic guiding in the Brighton area, and she remained captain of the 6th Hove company until March 1923. Like the 11th and 23rd Brighton guide companies, this was one of the eight companies already affiliated to the Catholic Women's League Girl Guides, affiliated to the guide movement, when the league's standing committee of guide leaders was launched in 1920. It was clearly an active and successful company. In February 1921 the Brighton Catholic Women's League branch (founded in December 1908) reported, &#145;It is very gratifying to learn that the splendid work done by Miss Freeman in connection with the Girl Guides has been publicly recognized by the local Commissioner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catholic Women's League Magazine</span>, no. 112, 1921, 4).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">On the Right Trail: Friendly Counsel for Catholic Girl Guides</span> (1921) was very favourably reviewed in the <span class="italic">Girl Guides Gazette</span> and in the <span class="italic">Catholic Women's League Magazine</span> of January 1922. It was prefaced and recommended by Cardinal Bourne, archbishop of Westminster, who had taken a particular interest in promoting Catholic Girl Guides. Although it was the first book to incorporate the moral principles of guiding within a Roman Catholic devotional context, it was apparently considered as helpful for all guides. Like <span class="italic">God's Golden Gifts</span> (dedicated to Monsignor Connelly), this work was dedicated to the current Roman Catholic parish priest of Hove&#151;another convert, the &#145;Right Rev Monsignor Canon Thomas Ottley, to whose ever-ready help and sympathy I owe so much&#146;.<br>
<br>In April 1919 the Brighton Catholic Women's League branch reported &#145;with pleasure&#146; the reopening of the girls' club (founded in 1909) &#145;under Miss Freeman&#151;who is so well known for her good work among girls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Catholic Women's League Magazine</span>, no. 90, 1919, 7). Club members' activities (like those of Freeman's guides) included drilling, first aid, gardening, ethnic dancing, and the production of plays and an operetta, which were so successful financially that the club often presented cheques to the Catholic Women's League branch. The girls' club also successfully entered the competitions of the Brighton and Hove Girls' Club Union.<br>
<br>By 1925 Freeman was a member of the third order of St Francis, a Roman Catholic lay order, affiliated to the mainstream order for monks. <span class="italic">Thoughts from St Francis of Assisi</span> (1925), the third of a series published by Burns, Oates, and Washbourne, was also well reviewed in the <span class="italic">Catholic Women's League Magazine</span>. This work had a foreword by Father Cuthbert of the order of St Francis Capuchin, who was superior of the Capuchin house in Oxford. By contrast with Freeman's earlier works, all the commentaries were by Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>Through practical action and writing, Freeman made an important contribution to the creation of a nationwide organization, the National Organization of Girls' Clubs (founded in 1911), which was renamed the National Association of Girls' Clubs and Mixed Clubs in 1945. That Freeman's club and guide work was appreciated by contemporaries is indicated by the comments of clergy and frequent references and advertisements in the <span class="italic">Girls' Club Journal</span> from 1909 to 1914 and the <span class="italic">Catholic Women's League Magazine</span> from 1919 to 1925. The case studies cited by Freeman indicate that at least some working-class girls did enjoy and benefit from her clubs and her personal care for them.<br>
<br>Apart from dedications to her mother, &#145;S. A. D.&#146;, &#145;my girl friends&#146;, and Grace Stephenson, Freeman's books suggest that some of her most important relationships were with clergy, both Anglo-Catholic and Roman Catholic. She was one of a number of Roman Catholic women writers around the turn of the century and is listed in <span class="italic">The Guide to Catholic Literature</span>. Her places of residence and contacts reflect the strength of Anglo-Catholicism and Roman Catholicism in London and Brighton and on the south coast. She died at Lee House, 61 Dyke Road, Brighton, on 23 May 1960 and, after a requiem mass, was buried in Hove cemetery.<br>
