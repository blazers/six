<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cabrera Infante,  Guillermo</span>  (1929&#150;2005), <span class="occ">novelist and writer</span>, was born on 22 April 1929 in Gibara, Cuba, the eldest son of Guillermo Cabrera L&oacute;pez (<i>c</i>.1900&#150;1990) and his wife, Zoila Infante Castro (1909&#150;1965). His parents founded the Cuban Communist Party and were imprisoned in 1936 for their political activities. In 1941 the family moved to Havana, which came to occupy the centre of his literary imagination.<br>
<br>Cabrera Infante began studying medicine at the University of Havana in 1949 but soon devoted himself to journalism and literature, entering the school of journalism, where he studied from 1950 to 1954. His journalism focused on the cinema, a lifelong passion, and in 1951 he co-founded the Cinemateca de Cuba (Cuban Film Archive). He contributed to the magazine <span class="italic">Bohemia</span>, and in 1952 was briefly jailed for publishing a story containing &#145;obscenities&#146;, and forbidden to write under his own name. He subsequently adopted the pseudonym G. Ca&iacute;n (a characteristic pun based on the first syllables of his surnames). Between 1954 and 1960 he wrote film reviews for the weekly <span class="italic">Carteles</span>, of which he became editor from 1957 to 1960. His knowledge of film was wide-ranging, and his collection of film criticism from this period, <span class="italic">Un oficio del siglo XX</span> (1960; published in translation as <span class="italic">A Twentieth-Century Job</span>, 1991) is urbane and perceptive. In 1953 he married Marta Calvo, with whom he had two daughters, Carola and Ana. They divorced in 1961 and that same year he married the actress Miriam G&oacute;mez, a relationship which endured until his death.<br>
<br>When Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 Cabrera Infante initially supported the new regime. He was appointed a director of the new film institute (ICAIC) and also edited <span class="italic">Lunes de Revoluci&oacute;n</span>, the weekly literary supplement of the communist newspaper, <span class="italic">Revoluci&oacute;n</span>. He published his first book of short fiction, <span class="italic">As&iacute; en la paz como en la guerra</span> in 1960 (this was subsequently published in translation as <span class="italic">Writes of Passage</span>, 1993). In 1961 he clashed with the government over the censorship of the film <span class="italic">PM</span>, directed by his brother, and a polemical discussion appeared in <span class="italic">Lunes de Revoluci&oacute;n</span>. The latter was closed down and Cabrera Infante banned from publishing. Distancing himself from increasing political control, he accepted appointment in 1962 as cultural attach&eacute; in Brussels, becoming charg&eacute; d'affaires in 1964&#150;5.<br>
<br>In Brussels Cabrera Infante worked on what became his most acclaimed novel, <span class="italic">Tres tristes tigres</span> (1967; <span class="italic">Three Trapped Tigers</span>, 1971). The novel's tongue-twisting title perfectly captures its wit. It is a celebration of Havana's pre-revolutionary night life, full of word play, often humorous and sexual in nature. An initial note insists that it is an attempt to capture the human voice on the wing and that it is written in &#145;Cuban&#146;. The linguistic improvisation and passages of rumination are reminiscent of jazz, by turns joyous and reflective. Displaying immense technical sophistication, the novel has little conventional narrative (the structure is akin to collage), but storytelling is not the point. It is an exploration of Havana voices, as well as having elements of scintillating parody, questioning the very nature of literary representation. Faulkner and Sterne are antecedents, but it is above all James Joyce (Cabrera Infante referred to him as &#145;J'aime Joys&#146;) who inspired the intoxicating invention. It won the prestigious Biblioteca Breve award in Spain.<br>
<br>Cabrera Infante returned to Havana in 1965 for his mother's funeral and then opted for exile and never returned. He initially went to Spain but the Franco regime refused him resident's status, and in 1966 he moved to London where he remained until his death, becoming a British citizen in 1979. In a BBC interview he later expressed the view that exile had made him a professional writer. But exile was demanding and he experienced severe depression, which curtailed his writing. He recovered and his later output was diverse. He wrote screenplays for the cinema (<span class="italic">Wonderwall</span>, 1968, and <span class="italic">Vanishing Point</span>, 1971) and adapted <span class="italic">Tres tristes tigres</span> for the screen (2005, as <span class="italic">The Lost City</span>). Other notable works of his exile years were <span class="italic">Vista del amanecer en el tr&oacute;pico</span> (1974; <span class="italic">A View of Dawn in the Tropics</span>, 1978), exploring the story of Cuba from discovery to the present; the experimental <span class="italic">Ejercicios de esti(l)o</span> (1976; &#145;Exercises in style&#146;); a second volume of film writing, <span class="italic">Arcadia todas las noches</span> (1978; &#145;Arcadia every night&#146;); and, above all, his second novel, <span class="italic">La Habana para un infante difunto</span> (1979; <span class="italic">Infante's Inferno</span>, 1984). This semi-autobiographical novel is a nostalgic examination of growing up in middle-class Havana during the 1940s and 1950s. He also published <span class="italic">Holy Smoke</span> (1985), a celebration of smoking (he was a devoted smoker of cigars), written in English. He won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1970, and the foreign book prize (France) in 1971.<br>
<br>Cabrera Infante's writings on Cuba under Castro were collected in <span class="italic">Mea Cuba</span> (1992), which reveals his contempt for the regime. In an interview in 1968 he attacked Castro, and he was then declared a traitor. He insisted that he was never a communist, but his anti-Castroism did not derive from a commitment to the right. In political terms he is probably best described as liberal. In his last years he remained prone to depression and illness. He died in Charing Cross Hospital on 21 February 2005 of MRSA and a chest infection caught after fracturing his hip. He was survived by his wife and the two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
<br>Cabrera Infante was the leading Cuban novelist of his generation and one of the most distinguished Latin American writers of his time. For his lifetime achievement he was awarded the Premio Cervantes in 1997, the leading literary award in the Spanish-speaking world. His masterpiece was <span class="italic">Tres tristes tigres</span>, but he had considerable achievements beyond that. He wrote with wit and elegance, and had a fascination with words and their plasticity that was allied to daring humour or sarcasm. He said that Havana was the greatest discovery of his life, and his themes and ideal readers undoubtedly remained Cuban. Never a political writer like other leading Latin American writers, none the less he articulated trenchant anti-Castro views. In Cuba <span class="italic">Tres tristes tigres</span> was classified as counter-revolutionary, and from 1968 until his death his books were banned. He remained devoted to the island of his birth and it was his wish that his ashes be kept for burial in Cuba after the death of Castro.<br>
