<span class="headword">Digges,  Dudley</span>  (1613&#150;1643), <span class="occ">royalist political writer</span>, was born in Chilham, Kent, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7635/', "Sir Dudley Digges (1582/3&#150;1639)")</script>, diplomat and judge, and Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe of Olantigh, Kent, and a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7639/', "Thomas Digges")</script>, mathematician. He entered University College, Oxford, in 1629, proceeding BA on 17 January 1632 and MA on 15 October 1635. He was elected fellow of All Souls College in 1632, and in 1637 was incorporated into the University of Cambridge. In 1641 he was entered at Gray's Inn, but before September 1642 was back in Oxford, as one of the delegacy appointed to provide means for defending the town against parliament during the civil war. Digges contributed loyal poems to collections published by the university, including <span class="italic">Musarum Oxoniensium</span> and <span class="italic">Solis Britannici perigaeum coron&aelig; Carolin&aelig;</span>, both in 1633, and <span class="italic">Flos Britannicis versis novissimi filiola Carol&aelig; et Mari&aelig;</span>, in 1637. A poem by him on the great frost of 1634 also survives in the Bodleian Library. In the same year Digges published an edition of his grandfather's mathematical work <span class="italic">Nova corpora regularia</span>, but he is remembered as a royalist pamphleteer and political philosopher.<br>
<br>In July 1642 Henry Parker, secretary to the parliamentary army, argued in an anonymous pamphlet that the parliament had a &#145;special function of &#147;umpirage&#148; between king and kingdom in rare cases of conflict&#146;  (Burgess, 204). Digges replied with <span class="italic">An Answer to a Printed Book, Intituled, Observations upon some of His Majesties Late Answers and Expresses</span>, printed at Oxford in November 1642, by his majesty's command. It was one of several royalist responses to Parker, but is regarded as the most detailed and persuasive. Two counterfeit editions of this work were printed in London, one in 1642, and another in 1647. <span class="italic">A Reply to the &#145;Answer&#146;</span> &hellip; by &#145;J. M.&#146; (previously ascribed to John Milton by the first edition of Wing's <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue</span>) was also published in November 1642. <span class="italic">An Appendix to the Late &#145;Answer&#146;</span> followed, but this was both written and printed in a different style from the original, and Falconer Madan questioned whether it was the work of Digges or published in Oxford  (Madan, 2.181). Madan also contradicts the otherwise widely accepted attribution to Digges of yet another answer to Parker's <span class="italic">Observations</span> entitled <span class="italic">A Review of the &#145;Observations&#146; upon some of His Majesties Late Answers</span>. This &#145;ponderous&#146; work was issued in April 1643, and Digges is named as the author in Philip Bliss's edition of Wood's <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span>, in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and in the <span class="italic">British Museum Catalogue of the Thomason Tracts</span>. Madan suspected this may have been due to confusion with <span class="italic">An Answer to a Printed Book</span> by a previous owner of a copy of <span class="italic">A Review</span>, and regarded the attribution as &#145;unlikely&#146;  (ibid., 2.249&#150;50).<br>
<br>Digges's most substantial work, and his contribution to contemporary political philosophy, was <span class="italic">The Unlawfulnesse of Subjects Taking up Armes against their Soveraigne</span>, which appeared in late 1643, after his death. This was a detailed and closely reasoned debate over the respective authorities of the king and parliament, described as &#145;a sort of compendium of royalist argumentation&#146;  (Allen, 494). It is based mainly on natural rights arguments, and &#145;closer to Hobbesian than to James I and Filmer's school of royalist thought&#146;  (Burns, 670&#150;71). Digges argued that people were originally in a condition of complete liberty, but that it was rational for them to covenant to establish a civil sovereign. The renunciation of original rights was irreversible, and to suggest their continuance in civil society was subversive. He did not argue for absolute royal authority, but &#145;the right of the monarchy not to be accomptable to any inferior jurisdiction&#146;  (Burgess, 210). This work enjoyed continuing popularity among royalists and was reprinted in London in 1644, and on three occasions after the Restoration (in 1662, 1664, and 1679).<br>
<br>Digges died at Oxford from a malignant camp fever (presumably typhus) on 1 October 1643 and was buried in the antechapel of All Souls. He left over 1000 volumes to the college. Anthony Wood described him as &#145;advantaged by a great memory, and excellent natural parts, which he improved by close studying, he became a general scholar and a good poet and linguist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 3.1717&#150;18).<br>
