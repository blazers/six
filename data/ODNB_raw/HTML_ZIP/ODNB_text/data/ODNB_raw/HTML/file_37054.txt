<span class="headword">Carington,  Charles Robert  Wynn-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Charles Robert Carrington]</span>, marquess of Lincolnshire  (1843&#150;1928), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born in Whitehall, London, on 16 May 1843, the elder son of Robert John Carrington (formerly Smith), second Baron Carrington, and his second wife, Charlotte, younger daughter of Peter Robert Drummond-Burrell, twenty-first Baron Willoughby de Eresby. Educated at Eton College and, from 1861, at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1863, Carrington entered the Royal Horse Guards (captain 1869, retired 1878). His careers were those of great landowner and Liberal politician, and he combined the two with unwavering conviction over half a century of radical social and political change that drew almost the entire aristocracy into the Conservative Party and saw its power rapidly wane. In 1865, at the age of twenty-two, Carrington was returned to the House of Commons unopposed for his home town of High Wycombe, taking the Liberal whip. On the death of his father three years later he succeeded to the peerage as third Baron Carrington and to an estate of 26,000 acres, predominantly in Buckinghamshire and Lincolnshire, the maintenance and improvement of which were lifelong preoccupations. In 1878 he married the Hon. Cecilia Margaret Harbord (1856&#150;1934), daughter of Charles, fifth Baron Suffield; they had one son and five daughters. In 1880 Carrington and his brothers took the surname Carington; this did not affect the spelling of the peerage title.<br>
<br>For the next sixty years after succeeding to his title Carrington held a succession of posts spanning the political, royal, and imperial spheres. In 1875&#150;6 he accompanied the prince of Wales (later Edward VII) on his Indian tour as aide-de-camp. He was a government whip and a court official&#151;as captain of the gentlemen-at-arms&#151;in the last four years (1881&#150;5) of Gladstone's second ministry. From 1885 to 1890 he was governor of New South Wales, establishing a pattern of aristocratic &#145;constitutional monarchy&#146; in the self-governing white colonies that was to endure until the inter-war years of the next century. On his return to England he was elected a Progressive (Liberal) member of the newly established London county council for the working-class ward of West St Pancras, taking an active part in LCC business and retaining his seat until 1907. Between 1892 and 1895 he again held court office, as lord chamberlain, in Gladstone's final ministry and in that of Rosebery, his cousin. At Gladstone's request he also chaired a controversial royal commission on Welsh land tenure, which reported in 1895, deftly deflating radical land agitation in the principality while encouraging landowners to meet moderate demands for allotments, smallholdings, improved rural housing, and rent abatements. In 1895 he was created Earl Carrington; the next year he took the additional surname of Wynn.<br>
<br>Carrington continued to advance the cause of land reform until the First World War, pioneering smallholding and cottage-building schemes on his own estates. By 1914 a quarter of the total estate was let as allotments or smallholdings. Rural regeneration was Carrington's principal goal. His policies were the stock-in-trade of late Victorian and Edwardian new Liberal reformers. In a wider view, they were but one incarnation of a &#145;back-to-the-land&#146; movement persisting from the industrial revolution to the present day. However, behind them lay a concern to modernize and popularize the great estates&#151;and so underpin their survival in the democratic age. Like Gladstone, his mentor, he saw progressive reform as the friend, not the foe, of the aristocracy and traditional social forces if carried through with confidence by the &eacute;lite itself.<br>
<br>Campbell-Bannerman appointed Carrington president of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in his Liberal ministry of 1905, a post he continued to hold under Asquith until 1911. Carrington was responsible for two allotments and smallholdings statutes in 1908, which extended rights to tenants and labourers. Neither measure was seriously injurious to landowners, but both bitterly antagonized the tory peers, who saw them as the thin end of a socialistic wedge leading to expropriation. As such they were part of the backdrop to Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146; of 1909, which Carrington supported as a moderate measure necessitated by a projected budget deficit, but which the House of Lords rejected as an act of immoral confiscation. The rejection led to the constitutional crisis of 1909&#150;10, in which Carrington's close links with the royal family were an asset to Asquith. He supported the proposed creation of peers to force the House of Lords to accept the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span>. On the accession of George V in 1910, he exercised the office of lord great chamberlain, fighting with characteristic vigour to sustain his claim to the largely honorific office (which came through his mother) against other aristocratic claimants to the post.<br>
<br>In 1911 Carrington moved to the non-departmental post of lord privy seal, retiring from the government a year later as marquess of Lincolnshire. His later years brought a succession of disappointments: the death of his only son in war in 1915; the ravages suffered by the great estates, which led him to dispose of some three-quarters of his estates between 1919 and 1924; and the decline of the Liberal Party which, by his death, had become a marginal political force. His retreat from land was but one act in an aristocratic stampede; however, in common with most of his fellow peers, his personal income rose as he moved into stocks. Lincolnshire's dedication to Liberalism and the cause of rural development remained undiminished to the end, and as lord lieutenant of Buckinghamshire from 1915 to 1923 he found a new outlet for his energies. His reaction to the general strike of 1926 typified a whig political outlook formed in the early Victorian era. He condemned the strike in public, but subscribed &pound;50 to the Miners' Women and Children Relief Fund, and dismissed more extreme forebodings with his recollection of the Chartists' 1848 demonstrations in London, &#145;when gamekeepers sat in the Hall with loaded guns between their knees &hellip; but the Charter is now practically the law of the land&#146;. He left three unpublished works, based on his extensive diaries, a life of Edward VII in three volumes, a life of Lord Rosebery in two volumes, and a volume of recollections.<br>
<br>Having earlier sold his ancestral home, Wycombe Abbey (which became a private girls' boarding-school), Lincolnshire died at his home, Daws Hill House, High Wycombe, on 13 June 1928. The barony (but not his other titles) passed to his younger brother, Rupert Clement George (<i>b</i>. 1852).<br>
<br>Carrington's political role was greater than his tenure of second-rank cabinet offices in the Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith governments might suggest. As a lifelong friend of Edward VII, as a close associate of successive Liberal leaders, as a colonial governor, as one of the few great landowners to remain loyal to Gladstone after the home-rule split of 1886, and as an indefatigable activist among the small band of Liberal peers thereafter, he had an abiding influence on the policy and tone of the late Victorian and Edwardian Liberal Party. He also helped to keep it respectable in royal quarters as, in government before the First World War, it engaged in increasingly fierce conflicts with the Conservative Party and the House of Lords&#151;conflicts in which Edward VII and George V were forced to take a decisive role, and did so in a spirit of strict neutrality.<br>
