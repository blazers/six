<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coleridge, Sir  John Taylor</span>  (1790&#150;1876), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the second son of Colonel James Coleridge and his wife, Frances Duke, daughter of Bernard Frederick Taylor and descended from the wealthy Duke family of Otterton. A nephew of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge")</script>, he was born on 9 July 1790 in St Peter's Street, Tiverton, where his parents lived after their marriage until 1796, when the colonel bought Heath's Court, Ottery St Mary, from the Heath family.<br>
<br>Coleridge was educated from 1796 until 1803 under his uncle, George Coleridge, at the King's School, Ottery St Mary, and then at Eton (1803&#150;9) and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was elected a scholar in 1809. At Corpus he was a friend of Keble and Arnold. His university career was one unbroken triumph. He won the chancellor's prize for Latin verse, the prizes for English and Latin essays, and the Vinerian scholarship. He was placed alone in the first class in classics in 1812 and was elected to a fellowship at Exeter College.<br>
<br>In 1814 a loan from John May, a wealthy Richmond wine merchant and a friend of the family, enabled Coleridge to make a tour of the continent. Between July and December he visited Paris, Lyons, Geneva, and the north of Italy as far as Venice, Bologna, and Florence. On 7 August 1818 he married Mary (1788&#150;1874), second daughter of the Revd Gilbert Buchanan, rector of Woodmansterne, Surrey.<br>
<br>After a period as a special pleader, Coleridge was called to the bar by the Middle Temple on 26 June 1819, helped by a further loan of &pound;1000 from John May. He practised from chambers in 2 Pump Court, Temple, and joined the western circuit and the Exeter sessions.<br>
<br>The early years were financially difficult; on one occasion Coleridge was unable to pay his ironmonger and upholsterer. For the first three years he frequently walked long distances on the western circuit. He supplemented his income from other sources: by taking pupils, including Francis Baring, the future Lord Northbrook, and John Boileau; by writing articles for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>; by editing Blackstone's <span class="italic">Commentaries</span>; and by being the editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> in 1825. In that year he made &pound;962 at the bar, &pound;1000 from the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, and &pound;500 for his edition of Blackstone.<br>
<br>From 1826 Coleridge concentrated on his profession. He was leader of the Exeter sessions from 1826, and county counsel from 1827 to 1829. At his best sessions in 1827 he made more than &pound;103. On the western circuit his progress was uneven: Serjeant Wilde was undisputed leader of the circuit from 1826 to 1834; Follett quickly overtook everyone else, but Coleridge established his position immediately after them. On 27 January 1832 he was elected recorder of Exeter by ten votes to seven against Follett. In London he had little business. He was appointed a commissioner in bankruptcy on 12 December 1827. He was counsel in the great case of <i>Rowe v. Brenton</i> in November 1828 which brought him into contact with the leading barristers of the time and with the king's advisers. He was appointed serjeant on 14 February 1832, but his practice suffered when the court of common pleas was opened in 1834. In 1834 his income was just under &pound;4000. By 1839 he was in a position to purchase Heath's Court from his elder brother, James Duke Coleridge.<br>
<br>On 27 January 1835 Coleridge was appointed a justice of the court of king's bench by Lord Lyndhurst in the place of Mr Justice Taunton. In civil cases his judgments were learned and elegant: for example, <i>Stockdale v. Hansard</i> (1839) in constitutional law; the <i>Bishop of Hereford's case</i> (1848) in ecclesiastical law; and <i>Lumley v. Gye</i> (1853) in the law of contract, a dissenting judgment which was praised by Holdsworth. He was involved in unfortunate controversy arising out of <i>Pooley's case</i> at Bodmin assizes in 1857. Pooley was convicted of a very offensive blasphemy and sentenced by Coleridge to twenty-one months in prison, but subsequently received a free pardon on grounds of insanity. The case was used in J. S. Mill's <span class="italic">On Liberty</span> to show that penalties for opinion still existed, and the controversy dragged on in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> and elsewhere. Coleridge retired from the court of queen's bench on 12 June 1858. He had been made a privy councillor on 5 June and served on the judicial committee in ecclesiastical cases for several years. He was offered a peerage by Gladstone in 1869 but refused because of the potential effect on his son's career: if he had become a peer and then died, his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5886/', "John Duke Coleridge")</script>, would have lost his position as MP and solicitor-general and, under the accepted rule at that time, the right to practise at the bar.<br>
<br>Coleridge served on a number of commissions, including those on the assize circuits in 1845, on the inns of court in 1854, and on the law courts and popular education in 1858. In 1852 he received the degree of DCL at Oxford, and in 1854 he was appointed a commissioner under the <span class="roman">Oxford University Act</span>, in spite of a motion in the House of Commons to exclude him on the grounds that he was an extreme high-churchman. His published lecture entitled <span class="italic">On Public School Education</span> (1860) contributed to the appointment of a royal commission on the public schools in 1861.<br>
<br>A prolific writer, Coleridge left a manuscript journal covering the period from 1820 to 1876, of which a few extracts have been published in books about the Coleridge family. He corresponded with Arnold, Southey, Newman, Pusey, and Keble, and his <span class="italic">Life of Keble</span> (1869) is heavily based on that correspondence. He was a close friend and admirer of the Tractarians, though never in entire agreement with them, as he made clear in his <span class="italic">Life of Keble</span>.<br>
<br>Coleridge had six children: Mary Dorothy Frances Coleridge (1819&#150;1820); John Duke (1820&#150;1894), the future lord chief justice; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5881/', "Henry James Coleridge (1822&#150;1893)")</script>, an Anglican priest who entered the Roman Catholic church in 1852; Mary Frances Keble Coleridge (1824&#150;1898), who rejected a proposal of marriage in 1845 from Roundell Palmer, the future Lord Chancellor Selborne, to her father's deep regret; Alethea Buchanan Coleridge (1826&#150;1909), who married J. F. Mackarness, the future bishop of Oxford; and Frederick William Coleridge (1828&#150;1843). Coleridge's wife died on 8 March 1874; he died at Heath's Court, Ottery St Mary, on 11 February 1876 and was buried in the family vault there on 17 February.<br>
