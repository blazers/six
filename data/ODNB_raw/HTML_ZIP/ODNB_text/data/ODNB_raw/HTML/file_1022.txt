<span class="headword">Badham,  Charles</span>  (1780&#150;1845), <span class="occ">physician and classical scholar</span>, was born in London on 17 April 1780, the son of David Badham. After receiving a sound classical education he entered Edinburgh University, where he graduated MD in 1802 with a dissertation entitled &#145;De urina et calculis&#146;. Badham was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1803. On 8 May 1806 he matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner. He graduated BA (1811), MA (1812), BM, and DM (1817). In March 1818 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in September of the same year he was admitted a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was censor of the college in 1821, and wrote the Harveian oration in 1840, delivered in his place by Sir Henry Halford.<br>
<br>Badham began to practise in London in 1803, and before long he was appointed physician to the duke of Sussex. He also became physician to the Westminster General Dispensary, and in partnership with Dr Crichton of Clifford Street he delivered lectures in London on physic, chemistry, and the materia medica.<br>
<br>After the peace of 1815 was agreed, Badham decided to visit the continent, where he spent two years travelling; he visited the less-known parts of the kingdom of Naples and passed to the Ionian Islands and then to Albania, where he was consulted by Ali Pasha. He then crossed Mount Pindus, went through Thessaly, and by Thermopylae to Athens, and then, by the isthmus and gulf of Corinth, to the Neapolitan coast. Badham's fondness for travel, in which he spent nearly half his time, and his taste for classical literature, was indulged at the expense of greater professional fame and fortune in London. Badham was content to earn his living as a physician to travellers on the continent.<br>
<br>However, in 1808 Badham demonstrated his worth as a physician by the publication of <span class="italic">Observations on the Inflammatory Affections of the Mucous Membrane of the Bronchiae</span>, a second edition of which, corrected and enlarged, appeared in 1814 under the title of <span class="italic">An Essay on Bronchitis, with a Supplement Containing Remarks on Simple Pulmonary Abscess</span>. In this treatise bronchitis, acute and chronic, was for the first time separated from peripneumony and pleurisy and the other conditions with which it had previously been confused, and its history, differential diagnosis, and treatment were established.<br>
<br>In 1812 Badham published <span class="italic">Specimens of a New Translation of Juvenal</span>, which was followed by a version of <span class="italic">The Satires of Juvenal, Translated into English Verse</span> in 1814. These works were very severely criticized in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> by William Gifford, himself the author of a translation of the same satirist, who considered that in Badham's <span class="italic">Specimens</span> &#145;in no instance has he entered the authors mind: he sees not his object; he feels not his energy; he comprehends not his dignified sarcasm&#146;  (<span class="italic">QR</span>, 8.64).<br>
<br>In 1827 the chair of the practice of physic at Glasgow became vacant, and Badham was recommended by his friend Sir Henry Halford to the duke of Montrose for the post. Although the Scottish physicians were not pleased at seeing an Englishman preferred before them, Badham's lectures justified his appointment. At Glasgow he devoted himself almost exclusively to the duties of his chair. The vacations he spent in travel, mostly in the south of Europe. Badham was a contributor to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. There appeared in April 1829 his &#145;Lines written at Warwick Castle&#146;, which had been printed with notes, for private circulation, in 1827. He also prepared &#145;An itinerary from Rome to Athens&#146;, but it was never published.<br>
<br>Badham was twice married: in early life to the beautiful Margaret Campbell, first cousin of the poet Thomas Campbell. Their four sons included the naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1024/', "Charles David Badham (1805&#150;1857)")</script> and the classical scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1023/', "Charles Badham (1813&#150;1884)")</script>. There were at least two daughters. About 1833 Badham married, secondly, Caroline, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9805/', "Admiral Sir Edward Foote (1767&#150;1833)")</script>. Badham died in London on 10 November 1845.<br>
