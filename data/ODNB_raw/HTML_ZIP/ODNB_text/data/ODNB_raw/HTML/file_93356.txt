<span class="headword">Thelwell,  Norman</span>  (1923&#150;2004), <span class="occ">cartoonist and illustrator</span>, was born on 3 May 1923 at 25 Crofton Road, Tranmere, Birkenhead, Cheshire, the younger of the two sons of Christopher Thelwell (1890&#150;1975), general labourer, and later maintenance engineer on seed-crushing machines for soap production at Lever Brothers, Port Sunlight, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vick (1891&#150;1964). His brother Alan later worked for the railways and Liverpool city council. He was a distant relative of the Revd Robert Carter Thelwell of Redbourne Hall, Lincolnshire, who featured in a painting of 1776 by George Stubbs. After attending Well Lane infants' school (1928&#150;33) and Rock Ferry high school, Birkenhead (1933&#150;9)&#151;where he won an art prize&#151;he left aged sixteen and worked for two years as a junior clerk in the office of Silcock's Seed Merchants in Liverpool docks.<br>
<br>Conscripted in February 1942, Thelwell served at first in the intelligence section of the 2nd battalion, East Yorkshire regiment, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, drawing maps and diagrams. For three years he was posted to various parts of Britain and in 1944, while training as a wireless operator in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, took evening classes at Nottingham Art School where he met his future wife, Rhona Evelyn Ladbury (<i>b</i>. 1925), a fellow student then serving in the Women's Land Army. She was the daughter of Harold Clyde Ladbury, carpenter and joiner; they were married on 9 April 1949 and had one son, David (<i>b</i>. 1950), and one daughter, Penelope (<i>b</i>. 1953). In 1944 he was posted to India. There he had some cartoons published in the service magazine <span class="italic">Victory</span>, which led to his being posted to general headquarters Delhi in 1945 to become art editor of a new monthly army publication for the Indian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, with the rank of sergeant. In August 1945 he had his first two drawings published in <span class="italic">The Artist</span>, after seeing a copy of the magazine in the NAAFI Club in Nottingham which had invited submissions. The following year he had his first cartoons published in <span class="italic">London Opinion</span>, and some of his caricatures of Indian service leaders (such as the viceroy, Lord Wavell, and Jayaprakash Narayan) appeared in <span class="italic">News Review</span>.<br>
<br>Demobilized in November 1946, Thelwell returned to Liverpool and took a full-time degree course at Liverpool College of Art (1947&#150;50), studying under H. P. Huggill and G. H. Wedgwood and specializing in illustration and commercial art. While still a student his income from cartoons and drawings continued to grow, with sales to <span class="italic">Men Only</span>, <span class="italic">London Opinion</span>, and <span class="italic">Everybody's Weekly</span>. After graduating as an art teacher in 1950 he then taught design and illustration at Wolverhampton College of Art (1950&#150;56). During this period he also drew a regular cartoon strip, &#145;Chicko&#146;, for the <span class="italic">Eagle</span> children's comic (from 1950 until it merged with <span class="italic">Lion</span> in 1969), and worked for the <span class="italic">Birmingham Post</span>. He sold his first drawing to <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1952; he eventually contributed more than 1600 cartoons&#151;including sixty covers&#151;to the magazine from 1952 to 1977. While a teacher he also produced his first book illustrations, for Denis Morris's <span class="italic">Poultry for Profit and Pleasure</span> (1954).<br>
<br>In August 1956 Thelwell was offered a job producing two editorial cartoons a week for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and so resigned from his job at Wolverhampton College of Art and became a full-time freelance artist. However, disliking the noise of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>'s London office, he continued to live in Codsall, near Wolverhampton (and from 1959 near Romsey in Hampshire), and sent his drawings to Fleet Street by train. He drew 387 cartoons for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> before its sudden demise in 1960, and then produced similar work for the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span> until it too closed down in 1961. Other freelance work included cartoons for <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, <span class="italic">Illustrated</span>, <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, <span class="italic">Farming Express</span>, <span class="italic">Farmer's Weekly</span>, <span class="italic">Countryman</span>, and <span class="italic">Esquire</span>. He also designed book jackets (including those for the Pan edition of the works of James Herriot), postage stamps, greetings cards (creating for Royles their most successful Christmas card of all time), and calendars (notably for Guinness), and worked in advertising (for W. H. Smith and others) and for television.<br>
<br>Thelwell's books were extremely successful. During his lifetime more than thirty collections of his cartoons were published and translated into many languages. The first of these was <span class="italic">Angels on Horseback</span> (1957), and others included <span class="italic">Thelwell Country</span> (1959), <span class="italic">The Penguin Thelwell</span> (1963), <span class="italic">The Compleat Tangler</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Thelwell Annual</span> (1980), <span class="italic">Some Damn Fool's Signed the Rubens Again</span> (1982), and <span class="italic">How to Draw Ponies</span> (1982). He also produced an autobiography, <span class="italic">Wrestling with a Pencil</span> (1986), and two volumes of memoirs, <span class="italic">A Plank Bridge by a Pool</span> (1978) and <span class="italic">A Millstone around My Neck</span> (1981). In addition he produced illustrations for books such as Margaret Baker's <span class="italic">Away Went Galloper</span> (1962), Edgar Anstey's <span class="italic">Committees: How They Work and How to Work Them</span> (1962), Dorian Williams's <span class="italic">Pony to Jump</span> (1963), Caroline Ramsden's <span class="italic">Racing Without Tears</span> (1964), Jennifer and Dorian Williams's <span class="italic">Illustrated Teach Yourself Show Pony</span> (1968), and Colin Willock's <span class="italic">Rod, Pole or Perch</span> (1978), among others.<br>
<br>A fine draughtsman, Thelwell had a realistic style, placing &#145;cartoon&#146; figures in naturalistic settings and with great attention paid to detail. He worked in pen, brush, Indian ink, and watercolour, and was particularly well known for his cartoons on fishing, sailing, motoring, and English country life&#151;especially those featuring young girls and ponies. His first drawing of a child on a pony was published in <span class="italic">Punch</span> in 1953 and he later drew a regular strip, &#145;Penelope&#146; (featuring a small girl named after his own daughter, and a pony called Kipper), for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> (1962&#150;71). His cartoons were signed &#145;thelwell&#146;, written with blob serifs in a wavy line, while his landscapes and other paintings had the signature &#145;Norman Thelwell&#146;.<br>
<br>Thelwell was one of the founder members of the British Cartoonists' Association in 1966. Examples of his work are held in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Cartoon Museum, and the British Cartoon Archive at the University of Kent. A number of exhibitions of his drawings have been held at commercial galleries in London and elsewhere, and examples of his work were also included in the major exhibition &#145;Drawn and quartered: the world of the British newspaper cartoon, 1720&#150;1970&#146; at the National Portrait Gallery in 1970, and in &#145;<i>Not</i> by appointment&#146;, an exhibition of royal cartoons opened by the prince of Wales at the London Press Club in 1977.<br>
<br>Thelwell had dark hair when young, and blue eyes. Clean-shaven, he smoked a pipe for many years, enjoyed playing <i>boules</i> and fly-fishing for trout and salmon, and was keen on restoring old buildings. After four years suffering from Alzheimer's disease he died of heart failure at Bereweeke Court Nursing Home, Winchester, on 7 February 2004, and was buried in Timsbury churchyard. He was survived by his wife, Rhona, his son, David (a wildlife artist), and his daughter, Penelope.<br>
