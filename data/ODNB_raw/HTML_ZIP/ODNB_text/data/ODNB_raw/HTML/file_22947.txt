<span class="headword">Quekett,  John Thomas</span>  (1815&#150;1861), <span class="occ">histologist</span>, was born at Langport, Somerset, on 11 August 1815, the youngest son of William Quekett, master of Langport grammar school, and his wife, Mary, daughter of John Bartlett. His elder brothers were William Quekett (1802&#150;1888) and <a href="#cosubject_22947">Edwin John Quekett (1808&#150;1847) [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>Quekett was educated by his father at home, where an emphasis was placed on natural history; when only sixteen, John gave lectures on microscopical subjects with the aid of a home-made microscope. He was then apprenticed to a local surgeon, and subsequently to his brother Edwin in London. He entered King's College and worked at the London Hospital medical school, qualifying at Apothecaries' Hall and the Royal College of Surgeons in 1840. He won a competitive three-year studentship in human and comparative anatomy at the latter in the same year, and on its completion in 1843 was appointed assistant conservator to the Hunterian Museum of the College of Surgeons, under Richard Owen, becoming demonstrator of minute anatomy in 1844. He made a collection of 2500 plant and animal microscopical preparations, including many injections, which was bought by the college in 1846. In 1841, on Owen's recommendation, he had been appointed secretary of the recently founded Microscopical Society of London. He retained the post until 1860, when he became president, but by that time he was too ill to contribute anything except his presidential address.<br>
<br>In 1846 Quekett married Isabella Mary Anne (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of Robert Scott of the Bengal civil service; they had four children. In 1852 he became the Royal College of Surgeons' professor of histology and resident conservator at the Hunterian Museum, Owen having moved out to reside at Richmond. On Owen's appointment as director of the natural history collections of the British Museum in 1856, the post of conservator was at once offered to Quekett, at &pound;500 per year.<br>
<br>Quekett's work as a histologist, both practical and literary, was original and prolific. His <span class="italic">Practical Treatise on the Use of the Microscope</span> (1848) was the first such work, and gave much encouragement to individual workers at this fruitful period in the use of the instrument in histology. He was a well-connected man of considerable scientific stature (the prince consort was among those who came to him for instruction). He was working with the microscope during the period in which it was becoming established as a serious scientific tool. He applied this tool with vigour, in one of the few places in Europe where his potential could have been realized.<br>
<br>In addition to his handbook, Quekett wrote two volumes of a catalogue of the histological preparations in the college (1850 and 1853), two volumes of lectures on histology (1852 and 1854), a joint work on fossil plants in the college (1859), and a catalogue of plants and invertebrates (1860). He wrote twenty-two papers, the majority of which were published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Microscopical Society</span>. In the early 1840s, while still a student and an assistant to Benjamin Travers (1783&#150;1858), he carried out highly original experimental work on the healing of wounds, which was published in Travers's <span class="italic">The Physiology of Inflammation and the Healing Process</span> (1844). In this the very eminent Travers pays most fulsome tribute to his young partner.<br>
<br>Quekett was elected to fellowship of the Linnean Society in 1857, and of the Royal Society in 1860. He had gone to Pangbourne to recover from an illness, and died there on 20 August 1861, of a seizure consequent on chronic Bright's disease. After his death his possessions were auctioned over several days from 10 December 1861. He had a large variety of scientific apparatus, including some important microscopes and scientific books, but also arms and armour, pottery, minerals, and machine tools. The auction realized some &pound;681, but did not include most of his ordinary household effects. The College of Surgeons paid an annuity to his widow, and the microscopical world set up a fund to assist his family. The Quekett Microscopical Club was established in 1865, and named so in his memory.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22947"></a><span class="headword">Edwin John Quekett</span>  (1808&#150;1847), <span class="occ">surgeon and microscopist</span>, was born at Langport. He underwent medical training at University College Hospital, becoming a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1830. He practised as a surgeon from 50 Wellclose Square, Whitechapel, and in 1835 he became lecturer on botany at the London Hospital medical college. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1836. A meeting, held in his house in 1839, resulted in the foundation of the Microscopical Society of London (later the Royal Microscopical Society), which was to exert so great an influence on the development of the instrument. He wrote fifteen papers, and had his name commemorated by Lindley in a genus of Brazilian orchids, <i>Quekettia</i>. He died in London on 28 June 1847 of diphtheria contracted during his duties, and was buried at Seasalter, Kent, near the grave of a Miss Hyder to whom he had been engaged before she had died of consumption.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22949"></a><span class="headword">William Quekett</span>  (1802&#150;1888), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Langport on 3 October 1802; he was the eldest of the three brothers. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, in 1822, and in 1825 was ordained curate of South Cadbury, Somerset. In 1830 he became curate of St George-in-the-East, where he remained until 1841 and was instrumental in establishing Christ Church, Watney Street, of which he was the incumbent from 1841 to 1854. On 2 July 1851 he married Mary Bennett, widow of the Revd E. V. Williams. His energy attracted the attention of Charles Dickens, who based his articles &#145;What a London curate can do if he tries&#146;  (<span class="italic">Household Words</span>, 16 Nov 1850) and &#145;Emigration&#146;  (ibid., 24 Jan 1852) on Quekett's work. In 1849 Quekett and Sidney Herbert established the Female Emigration Society. In 1854 Quekett was presented by the crown to the rectory of Warrington, where he restored the parish church, and died on 30 March 1888, just after the publication of his autobiography, <span class="italic">My Sayings and Doings</span> (1888).<br>
