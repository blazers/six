<span class="headword">Carey,  John Joseph</span>  (1919&#150;1995), <span class="occ">footballer and football manager</span>, was born on 23 February 1919 at 4 Adelaide Place, Lower Baggot Street, Dublin, the son of John Carey, van driver, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Byrne. He left Ireland at the age of seventeen when he was transferred by his Dublin club, St James's Gate, to Manchester United for a sum of &pound;200. In his first full season at Old Trafford, in 1937&#150;8, he played at inside forward and was part of the successful team that won promotion to the first division that year. In the same season he won his first international cap for the Irish team. He played for Manchester United during the first three seasons of the Second World War, in regional football leagues, but his career was interrupted in 1943 when he took the decision to join the British army. As a citizen of &Eacute;ire, Carey had the choice of not joining up, but argued that the country that gave him his living was worth fighting for. He served in the Queen's Royal Hussars and took part in the campaigns in the Middle East and Italy. While in the army he regularly coached and played in service teams.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Carey returned to Manchester United and was promoted to club captain by the new team manager, Matt Busby. By then he had played for the club in every position with the exception of outside left, including goalkeeper; Busby utilized him as a right back. Carey excelled, and marshalled a successful Manchester United team as captain. Between the 1946/7 and 1950/51 seasons, Manchester United finished runners-up in the league four times. The title was finally clinched in the 1951/2 season. In 1948 Carey achieved the pinnacle reserved for a select few players in the domestic game by leading his team to victory in the FA cup final. After defeating Stanley Matthews's Blackpool he was able to climb the steps at Wembley and receive the cherished trophy. In 1949 he was elected footballer of the year, and in 1950 sportsman of the year.<br>
<br>In addition to his successful domestic career Carey also resumed international appearances after the war. He captained the Republic of Ireland to a 2&#150;0 victory over England at Goodison Park in 1949, thereby inflicting the first ever defeat on an England team in a full international fixture played on home soil. As a result of his military service, and the ongoing disputes between the two football associations in Ireland over player selection, Carey also qualified to play for Northern Ireland after 1945. He took the opportunity, and played for both Northern Ireland and the republic in the four years following the war. He was one of thirty-two players to be capped by both countries, winning nine caps for Northern Ireland and twenty-nine for the republic. In the space of three days in 1948 he played for both Irish teams, each time against England. His standing within international football was celebrated in 1947 when he was chosen as the captain of a Rest of Europe team against England.<br>
<br>In 1953 Carey finally retired as a player. Although offered a coaching post under Busby at Old Trafford, he elected to move into management. His first club was second-division Blackburn Rovers. After four successful years of development, Blackburn finally achieved promotion to the first division in 1958. In the close season Carey chose to move on, and took the management post at Everton. He rebuilt a moribund team and directed them to a credible fifth place in the league by the close of the 1961 season. Such steady progress was not enough for the Everton chairman, John Moores, and Moores sacked Carey in the back of a London taxi <i>en route</i> for the Football League annual meeting. Carey then moved to Leyton Orient, and he led the London team to the first division for the first time in their history in his first season there. In 1963, following Leyton Orient's relegation, he moved on to Nottingham Forest. In 1966/7 he had his most successful season as a manager, and led his team to second place in the first division and a place in the FA cup semi-finals. The 1968/9 season was a disaster and Carey was sacked in December 1968 at a point when Nottingham Forest were still waiting for their first home win of the season. He moved back to Blackburn in the 1969/70 season in an administrative capacity, but by 1970 had been reinstalled as team manager. The team was unsuccessful, and was relegated to the third division in 1971. This was Carey's last management job.<br>
<br>In 1971 Carey began work for a textile company, and then moved on to the treasurer's office of Trafford borough council, where he remained until his retirement in 1984. He returned to Old Trafford in the 1970s as a scout working for Tommy Docherty, and he retained his contacts with Manchester United until his death, which took place at Macclesfield District General Hospital, Macclesfield, Cheshire, on 23 August 1995. He was survived by his wife, Margaret.<br>
