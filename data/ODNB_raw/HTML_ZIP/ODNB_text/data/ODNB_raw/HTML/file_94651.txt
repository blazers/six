<span class="headword">Boxall,  Nellie</span>  (1890&#150;1965), <span class="occ">cook and servant</span>, was born on 2 November 1890 at 353 Somers Road, Farncombe, a small town in rural Surrey. She was the youngest of the ten children (six daughters and four sons) of Henry Boxall (1846&#150;1891), an agricultural labourer and later a railway worker, originally from Hambledon, Hampshire, and Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marsden (1848&#150;1902), from Bramley, Surrey. Her father died in April 1891 from a heart attack and Nellie was left an orphan at twelve years old when her mother died in September 1902 following a stroke. At Farncombe's national school, which she attended from 1895, she was among the first generation to receive a free elementary education but was expected, like millions of other poor girls, to go straight into domestic service. In 1912 she was lucky to find a post living in as a cook at Durbins, near Guildford, the Surrey home of the art critic and painter, Roger Fry. Fry had designed Durbins himself and the house's many modern conveniences&#151;including central heating, flush toilets, and a dumb waiter or lift to convey meals between the kitchen and dining room&#151;made the servants' life easier. Nellie worked alongside the parlour maid, Lottie Hope (1891&#150;1973), who became a lifelong friend.<br>
<br>In 1916, unable to maintain Durbins, Fry recommended Nellie and Lottie to the writers Leonard and Virginia Woolf (whose sister, the painter Vanessa Bell, had been Fry's lover). So began the eighteen-year employment for which Boxall is now best known, during which time Virginia Woolf wrote obsessively, and sometimes viciously, in her diaries and letters about their stormy relationship. At Hogarth House, Richmond, Nellie first encountered her new mistress recuperating after a severe mental breakdown. Nellie, who was shy and quietly spoken, thought Virginia a friendly, sympathetic person, and she enjoyed coaxing her poor appetite with treats&#151;home-made ice cream and lemonade&#151;and helping to establish the peaceful routine that made it possible for her mistress to write. Like Fry's, the Woolfs' household was remarkably informal: there was no uniform, no churchgoing, no waiting at table; nor was Nellie called Boxall, as was customary. The Woolfs paid modestly but were generous with luxuries, buying bicycles, a gramophone, and a wireless for their servants: Nellie and Lottie took dancing lessons and practised the foxtrot. Relations were more strained at Monk's House, the Woolfs' country cottage in Rodmell, Sussex. There was no heating or electricity; fuel had to be collected for the cooking range and water pumped from the well; there were rats and the kitchen frequently flooded; provisioning meant cycling several miles to the nearest shops. None the less Nellie remained, not least because the Bloomsbury circle was sociable and fun&#151;there was much visiting between Rodmell and Charleston, Vanessa Bell's home&#151;and, like the other servants, Nellie took a snobbish pride in her artistic, unorthodox employers.<br>
<br>When the Woolfs moved to 52 Tavistock Square in central London in 1924 they dismissed Lottie Hope and Nellie became their &#145;cook-general&#146;. She took on all the cleaning and extra chores such as polishing Leonard's boots, in addition to supplying regular substantial meals, baking for tea, and improvising impromptu dinner parties. She complained as much of her loneliness as of her workload and began giving notice (and then rescinding it) at frequent intervals. The next ten years were punctuated by rows and recriminations. Virginia hated having to give orders, resented her dependence on Nellie, and yet still expected deference and obedience; Nellie, as she became older and more vulnerable, resorted to tearful scenes and emotional blackmail. Both women were trapped in an outmoded relationship by their long intimacy: there was fury, shame, and mutual incomprehension on both sides. Virginia could be vitriolic in her diaries, denouncing Nellie as a &#145;mongrel&#146; with a &#145;timid spiteful servant mind&#146; and finding her physical presence &#145;loathsome&#146;. Yet elsewhere she is &#145;poor dear Nelly&#146; of whom Virginia is very fond. (In an interview with the BBC in 1956 Nellie recalled that when she was hospitalized with kidney trouble, Virginia arrived on the ward and, like a child, immediately cuddled her.) Once the Woolfs began employing local women in Sussex as their &#145;dailies&#146;, Nellie became effectively part-time. Finally, in spring 1934, after another showdown, Nellie was sacked (she refused a cheque for &pound;25 from the Woolfs). &#145;I feel executioner &amp; the executed in one&#146;, wrote Virginia  (26 March 1934, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.206). After July of that year Nellie Boxall was never mentioned again in Woolf's diaries but the figure of the servant haunts her novels.<br>
<br>In many ways Nellie Boxall's next thirty years were far happier. &#145;The poor drudge&#146; whom Woolf imagined doomed after her dismissal, immediately landed a more glamorous job cooking for the stage and screen stars of the day, Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester, at 34 Gordon Square, London, not far from the Woolfs. Nellie flourished in their streamlined ultra-modern flat with her breezy and bohemian young mistress, the daughter of Irish Marxists, and their maid, Happy Powley, who was a communist. Nellie's cordon bleu cookery delighted Laughton (the Woolfs had sent her for lessons with Marcel Boulestin, the chef who brought French cooking to the British) and she took the culinary demands of an actor's life in her stride, rustling up late suppers for the likes of Marlene Dietrich and Douglas Fairbanks junior. Celebrity of a sort arrived when her recipe for perfect roast beef appeared in the national press in 1936, promoting the Laughtons' new gas cooker.<br>
<br>When the Laughtons went to the USA in 1939 Nellie Boxall returned home to Farncombe. She joined forces again with Lottie Hope, and they shared a two-up, two-down terraced house with her brother Arthur at 30 North Street. Now in her fifties, Nellie worked in the canteen of St Thomas's Hospital, evacuated to Surrey during the war from central London. She spoke very little, apparently, about her past; interviewed by the BBC for <span class="italic">Portrait of Virginia Woolf</span> (1956), she loyally remembered how good-natured Mrs Woolf had been. Though Lottie liked a drink and had her boyfriends, neither of the women married or had children; they made rag rugs, cultivated their garden, and visited Nellie's family. By all accounts Miss Boxall, as the neighbours called her, ruled the roost. In the late 1950s Nellie, who had never had a room of her own, was the first in her street to buy her own house. She lived there with Lottie Hope until her death there from bronchopneumonia on 19 November 1965; her body was cremated at Guildford crematorium.<br>
<br>Woolf scholars have mainly interested themselves in her servants as a way of examining Woolf's contradictory relation to working women; her championing of women in her polemical writing&#151;<span class="italic">A Room of One's Own</span>, for example&#151;and the mythicizing, even sentimentalizing representations of the poor in her fiction. Less has been said about Woolf's private expressions of visceral disgust in her dealings with her servants, arguably of a piece with her inhibited relation to the body and to female sexuality. For social historians Woolf's diaries vividly reveal the emotional landscape of domestic life in Britain between the wars and the central part played by domestic service in the history of class feeling and consciousness. In literature and film Nellie Boxall has recently gained an afterlife. Alicia Gim&eacute;nez Bartlett's <span class="italic">Una habitaci&oacute;n ajena</span> (1997) invents her diaries and lambasts the snobbish goings-on in Bloomsbury, while in Daniele Roth's <span class="italic">Bloomsbury, Cote Cuisine</span> (2001) she looks back wistfully over her career. Rather than a figure of pathos, she is typecast as a comic character in Stephen Daldry's film version of Michael Cunningham's novel <span class="italic">The Hours</span>, where Nellie is a cockney battleaxe in cap and apron, brutishly chopping meat and nagging her nervous mistress.<br>
<br>In her feminist essay <span class="italic">Three Guineas</span> Virginia Woolf wrote that &#145;It is much to be regretted that no lives of maids &hellip; are to be found in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>&#146;, her father, Leslie Stephen, being the dictionary's first editor  (<span class="italic">Three Guineas</span>, 1938, ed. N. Black, 2001, 150). Recent acknowledgment of historically noteworthy servants, both male and female, reflects a wider interest in histories of the poor and the working class. Yet even when it is a labour of love, domestic service is never the full story of a human existence. Working for Virginia Woolf was only a chapter in the life of Nellie Boxall.<br>
