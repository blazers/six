<span class="headword">Cooper,  John Thomas</span>  (1790&#150;1854), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 29 June 1790 in Greenwich. He studied medicine and for a short while was a general practitioner, but, unable to cope with the anxiety and fatigue involved, turned to chemistry. He was married to Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1785&#150;1840) though further details are unknown; their second son, the naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6214/', "Daniel Cooper")</script>, predeceased his father. Until 1842 he made his living from lecturing as well as from selling chemicals, acting as a consultant analytical chemist, and devising or improving scientific instruments.<br>
<br>As early as 1810 he delivered popular lectures on chemistry in Mount Street, Lambeth. He later lectured on chemistry at the Russell Institution, at the Aldersgate school of medicine, and at the school of medicine in Webb Street, Southwark (founded by Edward Grainger), a position he occupied until 1842 when the school closed. Following this he devoted himself solely to the other aspects of professional chemistry.<br>
<br>In his business of selling chemicals Cooper was at one time the sole supplier of iodine in Britain and a successful preparer of potassium and sodium when the price of these elements was 10 and 12 guineas per ounce. In 1825 he used matches with heads made of sulphur and phosphorous.<br>
<br>In the course of his career Cooper invented several scientific instruments and made improvements to many more. In 1823 he published details of an improved apparatus for analysing organic bodies and also an account of a new hydrometer. For these two inventions he was respectively awarded, in 1823, the large silver medal and the gold Vulcan medal of the Society of Arts, of which he was a member between 1815 and 1829. With the optical instrument making company founded by William Cary he invented the oxy-hydrogen microscope, which he had perfected by 1835 and which was manufactured and retailed by Edward Montague Clarke. In 1839 he invented a baroscope which formed the subject of his only paper in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> and the topic of his first Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution. His only other Royal Institution discourse, in 1841, was on electroplating. In 1840 he published a paper recommending the use of copper instead of platinum in the electric cell recently invented by William Robert Grove; this suggestion led Robert Wilhelm Bunsen to invent his own cell. In 1843 he published improvements to William Hyde Wollaston's refractometer. He was also the first to employ Canada balsam for mounting microscopic objects, an invention of important practical use.<br>
<br>As a consultant analytical chemist Cooper appeared in trials (including the Severn and King insurance case in 1820) to give expert testimony. In 1827 he carried out some chemical experiments for the subcommittee of the joint Royal Society and board of longitude committee to improve optical glass. This subcommittee (which comprised John Frederick William Herschel, George Dollond, and Michael Faraday) was responsible for making optical glass and determining its properties. In the late 1840s and early 1850s Cooper's analytical services were retained by various London water companies in their fight with Edwin Chadwick. He published some of the analyses that he performed, such as of calculi (1816), zinc ores (1820), and ancient ruby (1824). One of the results of these kinds of activities was that he made several chemical discoveries. For instance, in 1817 he described some new compounds of platinum and two years later a method to separate lime and magnesia. He independently discovered iodoform (though it was originally thought of as the sesqui-iodide of carbon) about 1823, but because Cooper failed to publish it the credit went to Georges-Simon Serullas. One interest that he had which seems not to have stemmed from his analytical work was in the Fraunhofer lines of the solar spectrum. In 1831 he published a method of observing them and in 1839 announced, in a note published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span>, that the infra-red spectrum also contained Fraunhofer lines.<br>
<br>Cooper was described in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as having an unostentatious character, which doubtless accounts for the paucity of information about him, but he was, nevertheless, well-known in London's scientific community; he was one of the founders of the Chemical Society in 1841, and is said also to have had a connection with the Spitalfields Mathematical Society. He died after a long and painful illness on 24 September 1854 at his home, 82 Blackfriars Road, London, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. He was survived by a son and a daughter.<br>
