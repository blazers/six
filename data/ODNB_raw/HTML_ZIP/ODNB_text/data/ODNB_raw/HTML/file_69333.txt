<span class="headword">Taylor,  Jonas Dearnley</span>  (1829&#150;1902), <span class="occ">building society manager</span>, was born on 19 January 1829 at Skircoat, Halifax, the son of William Taylor, woollen manufacturer. Apart from his nonconformist upbringing, which had a formative influence upon his life, other aspects of his childhood and youth remain obscure. He attended King Cross Wesleyan Methodist Sunday School, Halifax, but later became associated with Sion Congregational Church and then Park Congregational Church, of which he became a founder member in 1869, deacon, and secretary. After leaving school he became a solicitor's clerk with the Halifax attorneys E. M. Wavell and later Stocks and Franklin, before founding his own firm of chartered accountants. At the time of his death he was the oldest chartered accountant in Halifax. He married first, at the age of nineteen, on 21 April 1848 at Halifax parish church, Martha Ann Eastwood (1824/5&#150;1893), the daughter of Thomas Eastwood, a cloth dresser, and soon after her death he married at St Paul's Church, South Kensington, London, on 7 September 1894, his second wife, Ellen Sarah Hill (1857/8&#150;1935), the daughter of John Hill, a butcher, whom he had met returning to England from the United States of America. He loved the company of children, and his first wife &#145;bore him a numerous family&#146;.<br>
<br>Taylor is principally remembered for his pioneering role in the foundation and development of the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building Society, of which he was secretary for almost half a century from its foundation in February 1853 until his death in September 1902. He was a member of the deputation which secured from the chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue exemption for the society from income tax in 1864. He evidently possessed a genius for organization and a talent for bookkeeping, patenting several labour-saving devices in that connection. He urged the development of a strong branch network, and during his term of office the society acquired some fifty branches, mostly in Yorkshire, including major branches at Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds, and Bradford. He also maintained strict controls on expenditure. During his lifetime the number of head office staff never rose above ten, and staff salaries and office running costs were kept as low as possible, for example by drafting letters on reused envelopes. At the time of his death the society had acquired assets of &pound;1.5 million sterling. Taylor was respected for his integrity and for his &#145;foremost thought&#146; that &#145;should a person bring money to the society, he should receive it back again&#146;  (<span class="italic">Home Owner</span>, 5). He was a Liberal by conviction but took no active part in politics; when approached to contest a seat in the local municipal elections, he suddenly withdrew at the last moment. However, he served briefly in 1848 to 1849 as secretary of the Halifax Co-operative Trading Society and in 1857 he became a leading campaigner for public baths in the town. He also helped to promote a major model housing development of some 300 dwellings at West Hill Park, Halifax, to &#145;encourage thrifty artisans, clerks and others to obtain freehold dwellings for themselves&#146;, for which the Halifax Permanent advanced loans amounting to nearly &pound;45,000  (J. Hole, <span class="italic">The Homes of the Working Classes with Suggestions for their Improvement</span>, 1866, 75).<br>
<br>Photographs and a portrait in oils commissioned by the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building Society from the artist Ernest Moore shortly before Taylor's death reveal a man of medium height and portly build with silvery white hair and neatly trimmed beard and moustache. A former colleague later recalled that he usually &#145;came to business attired in a dark morning coat and striped trousers&#146; sporting a top hat and umbrella and &#145;always commanded much attention&#146;, particularly when &#145;slowly picking his way through the crowds&#146;, escorted by a junior clerk laden with heavy bags of cash on his regular journeys to the Halifax Joint Stock Bank to bank the receipts from the society's branches  (Hobson, 57&#150;61). In business, he was &#145;autocratic, but kind and with a sense of humour&#146;  (ibid., 61), &#145;of quick temper, but readily conciliated&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building Society</span>, 137), and had &#145;a brisk and energetic manner&#146;  (Hobson, 57). He was &#145;a strict disciplinarian in the office&#146; and a stickler for punctuality. The mainspring of his character was &#145;a strong and rather simple kind of faith&#146;, and in private life &#145;nothing pleased him better than to spend an evening at home in the company of some of his friends, especially men associated with him in church activities&#146;  (ibid., 537&#150;61).<br>
<br>Shortly after presenting his forty-ninth annual report to the society's annual general meeting, Taylor's health began to fail, and he died on 3 September 1902 at Bute House, 6 The Crescent, Bridlington, Yorkshire, from diabetic gangrene. He was survived by his second wife, but by only two sons and one daughter from his first marriage. After an impressive funeral service at Park Congregational Church, Halifax, Taylor was buried at the Halifax general cemetery, Lister Lane, Halifax, on 6 September. His funeral procession was headed by the directors of the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building Society, bankers and solicitors, surveyors and auditors, staff at the society's head office, branch secretaries, and agents. In his eulogy, the Revd G. S. Smith described him as &#145;a man of minute detail&#146; who was &#145;straight as an arrow in all his dealings and righteously indignant with all who deviated from the right course&#146;  (<span class="italic">Halifax Guardian</span>, 13 Sept 1902). One local newspaper in its obituary maintained that he had &#145;probably done more to encourage thrift than any other single individual&#146; in the town of Halifax, where an extraordinarily large proportion of householders were owner-occupiers  (<span class="italic">Halifax Courier</span>). His tombstone inscription recorded simply that he had been a founder and for fifty years secretary of the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building Society.<br>
