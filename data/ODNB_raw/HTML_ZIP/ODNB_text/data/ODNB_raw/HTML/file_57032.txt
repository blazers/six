<span class="headword">Dawson,  Peter Smith</span>  (1882&#150;1961), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 31 January 1882 in Adelaide, South Australia, the youngest son and the eighth of the ten children of Thomas Dawson (1842&#150;1919) and Alison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller (1841&#150;1916). Both his parents were Scottish; his father, originally from Kirkcaldy and later a seaman, had settled in Adelaide in 1863 and established a plumbing business. Peter was educated at East Adelaide primary school and Pulteney Street grammar school. His mother ensured that all the children had musical training and Peter made his d&eacute;but as a boy soprano at St Peter's town hall, Adelaide, at the age of seven. A keen sportsman, he won medals for running and swimming but music remained an abiding interest and at sixteen he joined the choir of St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Wakefield Street, Adelaide, studied singing with C. J. Stevens, founder and conductor of the Adelaide Choral Society, and began appearing in singing competitions and concerts. When Dawson left school he joined the family firm as an apprentice plumber but Stevens, convinced that the young man had a future as a singer, persuaded his reluctant father to send him to England to study.<br>
<br>Dawson sailed for England in 1902 and was taken on by the eminent British singer Sir Charles Santley, with whom he studied for three years. Subsequently a Russian singing specialist, Professor Kantorez, extended his range from one of E[flat] to D to one of E[flat] to A, converting him from a bass to a bass&#150;baritone. Santley persuaded Madame Emma Albani to include Dawson in her touring concert party in 1904 and launched him on his professional career. In 1909 he appeared in <span class="italic">The Mastersingers</span> at Covent Garden but he disliked opera, considering it &#145;too much work for too little pay&#146;  (Dawson, 22). On the other hand, he enjoyed singing in oratorio, <span class="italic">Messiah</span> being a particular favourite. He concentrated on his concert career and by the 1920s had established himself as the leading ballad singer in Britain. While the majority of his appearances were in concert halls, he also appeared with success in the music-halls and variety theatres, topping the bill at the London Palladium.<br>
<br>Although he toured the British Isles and the British empire extensively, Dawson himself recognized that he became a household name as a result of his recording career. He made his first recordings for the Edison Bell Company in 1904, the earliest a song called &#145;Navajo&#146; attributed to Leonard Dawson&#151;the beginning of a continuous recording career stretching from 1904 to 1958. Initially he sang for a wide range of labels and under a variety of names; he recorded most often under his own name but he also sang comic songs as Will Strong, light popular songs as Frank Danby, and Scottish songs as Hector Grant. He participated in six full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera recordings. He signed with HMV in 1906 and sang exclusively for that label from 1912 to 1953. In his autobiography he estimated that he had recorded 3500 songs and sold some 13 million copies, and subsequent estimates suggest sales of 25 million copies during his career. Not only was he performing on stage and gramophone records, but he broadcast regularly on the wireless after making his BBC d&eacute;but on Australia day, 26 January 1923. He also appeared in two films, <span class="italic">Chips</span> (directed by Edward Godal, 1938), for which he also composed the music, and <span class="italic">Okay for Sound</span> (directed by Marcel Varnel, 1938).<br>
<br>Dawson was married twice, first on 20 May 1905 to Annie Mortimer (Nan) Noble (1881&#150;1953), who sang professionally as Annette George. She was the daughter of theatre manager Thomas John Noble. She retired after being badly injured in a car accident in 1925. Following Nan's death in 1953, Dawson married her sister, Constance Bedford Noble (<i>b</i>. 1897), on 29 April 1954. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Dawson's forte was the ballad and his singing was always characterized by a clarity of diction, a sincere and robust delivery, and a consistently appropriate and never overstated emotional colouring. His popularity demonstrates the persistence of an essentially Victorian musical sensibility in the British public well into the twentieth century, a sensibility which was sentimental, nostalgic, patriotic, romantic, and religiose. There was no one to equal Dawson in singing &#145;Glorious Devon&#146;, &#145;The fishermen of England&#146;, &#145;The Cornish Floral Dance&#146;, &#145;The Holy City&#146;, or Stanford's setting of Newbolt's <span class="italic">Songs of the Sea</span> and the various settings of Kipling's <span class="italic">Barrack Room Ballads</span> (notably his rendering of &#145;Boots&#146;), all perennial parts of his repertoire. Dawson himself wrote some fifty songs under a variety of pseudonyms, notably J. P. McCall.<br>
<br>Dawson was in Australia in 1914 when war broke out and he returned at once to England to undertake concert work for war charities and the troops. Seeking a more direct involvement he returned to Australia and enlisted as a private in the army, but before he could see active service the armistice was declared. He was in Australia again when the Second World War broke out. Too old for active service, he remained there for the duration, resuming directorial duties at the family firm Thomas Dawson &amp; Sons, then producing tins for military use, but also broadcasting, recording, and touring army camps. He returned to England in 1947 and gave fifty-seven concerts, claiming that he was broke because of tax demands from both England and Australia and poor management of his finances. In 1951 he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Fifty Years of Song</span>. In 1954 he made a farewell tour of England and the next year his final English recordings, and in 1955 settled in Australia for good, making his final public appearances and recordings there in 1958. He died of heart failure in Sydney on 27 September 1961 and was buried in Rookwood cemetery, Sydney.<br>
<br>Peter Dawson was 5 feet 6 inches tall, sturdily built, with ruddy complexion, grey eyes, and tattoos on his arms and chest. Personally he was jovial and forthright, an enthusiastic smoker and practical joker, and showed extraordinary generosity to his fellow performers, actively promoting the careers not only of other Australians in England but also of up-and-coming young British singers. His repertoire testified to a deep love of Australia, and his devotion to the Scotland of his forebears and the England where he spent much of his career. His was a true imperial patriotism. As Cunningham Thom, rector of St David's Presbyterian Church, Haberfield, said in his funeral address: &#145;He belonged to the generation of Kipling and Henley, and of those strong, robust British poets and writers who were the voices of the then invincible British Empire and the then invincible British Army&#146;  (Vose, 103).<br>
