<span class="headword">Pritchard,  Thomas Farnolls</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was baptized on 11 May 1723 at St Julian's Church, Shrewsbury, the eldest in the family of four sons and one daughter of John Pritchard (1696/7&#150;1747), a joiner of Shrewsbury, and his wife, Hannah Farnolls. His own background was also as a joiner, but from the late 1740s onwards he developed a quite extensive professional practice in both Shropshire and the neighbouring counties. A speciality of his was the supply of chimney-pieces and other elements of interior decoration, and of funerary monuments. A drawing book of his designs of this type, later acquired by the library of the American Institute of Architects in Washington, indicates that he employed a number of carvers on a regular basis&#151;the two principal names are Alexander van der Hagen and John Nelson of Shrewsbury&#151;to execute them. Overall, his churches and houses are no more than pleasant provincial work&#151;examples are the rebuilding of St Julian's Church in Shrewsbury (1749&#150;50) and Hatton Grange, Shropshire (1764&#150;8)&#151;but his decorative and funerary designs reveal him as a highly competent exponent of both the rococo style and the Gothic manner of Batty Langley. Examples of his interior decoration are at Croft Castle, Herefordshire (1765), Gaines in Whitbourne, Herefordshire (<i>c</i>.1765), and Shipton Hall, Shropshire. Among his monuments, in the Gothic and rococo modes respectively, are those to Sir Whitmore Acton in Acton Round church, Shropshire (1763), and to Mary Morhall (<i>d</i>. 1765) in St Mary's, Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>Pritchard's chief claim to fame, however, lies in his role in connection with a structure of a quite different type which he did not live to see executed&#151;the famous iron bridge across the River Severn in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. His involvement with bridge building started in 1767, when he was appointed surveyor to direct the widening of the English bridge in Shrewsbury to a design by Robert Mylne; when that project was abandoned, he submitted a design for the new bridge which was rejected in favour of that by John Gwynn. Then in 1773&#150;4 he made two designs for a bridge to cross the Severn in Stourport, Worcestershire, the first to be of timber with stone abutments and the second a single arch of brick but resting on a cast-iron centre. Neither of these was adopted&#151;the executed bridge was a conventional masonry structure of three arches&#151;but in his design for the Coalbrookdale Bridge, made in 1775, he adapted some of the principles of the timber proposal to a structure wholly of cast iron. It was a modified version of this design which was executed by the Coalbrookdale ironworks in 1777&#150;9, the first iron bridge in the world.<br>
<br>On 1 January 1751 Pritchard married Eleanor Russell (<i>d</i>. 1768) at St Julian's Church; three of their children died young. Their surviving daughter, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1813), married the surveyor John White, whose son John White junior published an illustrated account of Pritchard's bridge designs in a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">On Cementitious Architecture as Applicable to the Construction of Bridges</span> (1832). In his later years Pritchard lived in a house called Eyton Turret in Eyton-on-Severn, Shropshire, which he had formed from one of a pair of Jacobean garden buildings in the former grounds of a demolished mansion. He died on 23 December 1777 and was buried at St Julian's, Shrewsbury. The full extent of Pritchard's work only became apparent with the discovery of his drawing book, reproduced in Julia Ionides' study of Pritchard's life and work (1999).<br>
