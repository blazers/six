<span class="headword">Maund,  Benjamin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1790, <em>d.</em> 1864), <span class="occ">botanist and horticulturist</span>, was born at Terrills in Tenbury, Worcestershire, and baptized on 7 November 1790, the middle son of Owen Maund (<i>c</i>.1753&#150;1813), a farmer, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1761&#150;1848). His published works testify to his having had some formal education before he was apprenticed, on 5 December 1806, to Thomas Griffiths, stationer, printer, and bookseller in Ludlow, then at its fashionable height. Griffiths's work was sometimes careless, an ironic start for Maund whose taste and standards were later so widely praised. On Christmas day 1813&#151;the day his father was buried&#151;Maund bought the Market Place printing and bookselling business of Sarah Thompson in Bromsgrove, moving by 1818 to the High Street where he prospered as a bookseller, stationer, printer, bookbinder, publisher, and chemist in a combination normal for the time. He specialized in veterinary medicines, preparing some&#151;like &#145;Drench for Staggers&#146;&#151;to his own formulae. In his large garden to the rear he experimented with seeds and plants obtained from around the world and with varieties of wheat which he exhibited in London. On 30 January 1817 he married Sarah Green (1792&#150;1857). A deeply religious man, &#145;of gentlemanly appearance, quiet, modest and unassuming&#146;  (Humphreys), Maund was active in the town's affairs as churchwarden, member of several parish committees, director of a bank, and prime mover in the building of a new town hall and cattle market. He was also a keen freemason, appointed provincial grand steward in 1852.<br>
<br>&#145;Man, by nature, inherits the love of flowers&#146;, Maund wrote in the preface to volume one of the <span class="italic">Botanic Garden</span> (13 vols., 1825&#150;51). He sought to share his lifelong passion by producing an interesting and useful publication affordable to everyone. Each monthly issue contained a plate with four engraved and hand-coloured figures of hardy ornamental flowering plants and eight pages of text. The principal artist was Edward Dalton Smith, of Chelsea, and the engraver, S. Watts. Maund, it is claimed, started the fashion for inserting additional material at the end of monthly numbers of botanical periodicals. With the <span class="italic">Botanic Garden</span> he issued <span class="italic">The Auctarium</span> (1833), a miscellany of practical advice and information; the <span class="italic">Floral Register</span> (1834), a source for newly introduced plants; and <span class="italic">The Fruitist</span> (inserted into the last three volumes), a forum for disseminating knowledge through notes and readers' questions. In 1827 he became a fellow of the Linnean Society and by the 1830s widespread favourable reviews&#151;and a gold snuffbox from an admiring king of Prussia&#151;had earned him a reputation sufficient to enlist several distinguished contributors, including the professors of botany at Cambridge and Edinburgh, and leading artists, such as Mrs Withers, &#145;Flower painter in ordinary to Queen Adelaide&#146;, for his second periodical, <span class="italic">The Botanist</span> (5 vols., 1836&#150;42), a more ambitious work issued monthly with four plates and descriptive letterpress. Again, Maund published additional material, a short yearly supplement, a basic introduction to botany with volume two, and a <span class="italic">Dictionary of English and Latin Terms</span>, meant to accompany the large quarto edition but instead published separately in 1850. In 1837 Maund and William Holl, proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Worcester Herald</span>, edited volume one of <span class="italic">The Naturalist</span> (5 vols., 1837&#150;9), a Worcestershire-based enterprise.<br>
<br>Two of Maund's daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah, began helping their father in their teens, together contributing over 200 illustrations. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69350/', "John Maund (1823&#150;1858)")</script>, his middle son, had a short but illustrious medical career in Australia. In 1851 Maund took Alfred Palmer into partnership and in 1859 he retired with his three daughters, to Leamington Spa, then Folkestone, and in 1862 to Sandown in the Isle of Wight where he died, at Clapton Villa, Sandown, on 21 April 1864. He was buried in Brading. In 1928 a memorial tablet was unveiled in St John's parish church, Bromsgrove. It is of Maund's head surrounded by a wreath.<br>
