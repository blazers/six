<span class="headword">Strode,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1594, <em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 6 November 1594 at Bovey Tracey, Devon, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38023/', "Sir William Strode (1562&#150;1637)")</script>, politician, of Newnham in the same county, and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1619), daughter of Thomas Southcote of Bovey Tracey, Devon. In 1614 Strode was admitted to the Inner Temple and on 9 May 1617 he matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford; he graduated BA on 20 June 1619.<br>
<br>In the last parliament of James I and in the earliest three parliaments called by Charles I, Strode represented Bere Alston in Devon. An energetic critic of the Caroline regime, in 1625 he favoured proceedings against Richard Montagu and in 1628 supported the petition of right and spoke in the remonstrance debate, linking perceived foreign and domestic threats to the English state. He apparently favoured the war with Spain. A close ally of Sir John Eliot in the Commons in 1629, he was concerned with religion and constitutionally provocative in asserting the position of parliament. On 2 March, when the speaker tried to adjourn the house and refused to put Eliot's resolutions to the vote, Strode played a major part in the disorderly scene which followed. He did not content himself with pointedly reminding the speaker that he was only the servant of the house, but called on all those who desired Eliot's declaration to be read to signify their assent by standing up. He explained:<blockquote>I desire the same, that we may not be turned off like scattered sheep, as we were at the end of the last session, and have a scorn put on us in print; but that we may leave something behind us. (Gardiner, 7.69)</blockquote>The next day Strode was summoned before the privy council. As he declined to come, he was arrested in the country. With Eliot and other imprisoned MPs he was a committed recalcitrant in the major state case of 1629&#150;30 which influenced Charles I's retreat to personal rule. When proceeded against in Star Chamber (proceedings which eventually lapsed) he repudiated the jurisdiction of the court and refused to answer outside parliament for words spoken within it. With five of the other prisoners he sued for <i>habeas corpus</i>, seeking bail, on 6 May 1629.<br>
<br>In a test case for the petition of right, Charles subverted the law in preventing the prisoners from being brought to court to be bailed, lodging them in the Tower. In October, Strode was one of those refusing bail linked to a good behaviour bond designed to rationalize their arbitrary imprisonment. He remained incarcerated in various prisons until January 1640, when released in a conciliatory gesture prior to the meeting of the Short Parliament. The Long Parliament later voted the proceedings against him a breach of privilege, awarding &pound;500 compensation, and in 1667 both houses upheld these resolutions.<br>
<br>Strode was returned for Bere Alston to the two parliaments elected in 1640, where his militancy was surely related to bitterness at his imprisonment. His sufferings gave him a position in Pym's group which his abilities would not have entitled him to claim, and though one of the most active MPs in the Long Parliament he was a fellow traveller rather than a prime mover among the agitators. His boldness and freedom of speech soon made him notorious. Clarendon terms him &#145;one of the fiercest men of the party&#146;, and &#145;one of those Ephori who most avowed the curbing and suppressing of majesty&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.86; 4.32). D'Ewes describes him as a &#145;firebrand&#146;, a &#145;notable profaner of the scriptures&#146;, and one with &#145;too hot a tongue&#146;  (J. Forster, <span class="italic">Arrest of the Five Members by Charles the First</span>, 1860, 220).<br>
<br>Strode's prominent pursuit of Long Parliament business reflected his &#145;godly&#146; and anti-episcopal religious views, his assertion of parliamentary authority over prerogative, and his political friendship for the Scots. He was one of the managers of Strafford's impeachment, and was so bitter that he proposed that the earl should not be allowed counsel to speak for him. He spoke against Lord Keeper Finch, recalling his actions as speaker of the house in 1629, and was zealous for the protestation, but arguably his most important constitutional act was the introduction of the bill for annual parliaments&#151;eventually the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span>. His speech in favour of the Scots was part of the manoeuvring which brought about the end of the projected settlement of early 1641.<br>
<br>In the second session of the Long Parliament, Strode was again provocative. On 23 October 1641 he seconded the motion against evil counsellors, and demanded that parliament have a negative voice in all ministerial appointments, and on 28 October he moved for revival of the committee for the grand remonstrance. In late November he moved that the kingdom be put in a posture of defence, thus foreshadowing the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span>.<br>
<br>To his activity rather than his influence Strode's inclusion among the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94998', "five members")</script> impeached by Charles I was due: Clarendon describes both him and Heselrig as &#145;persons of too low an account and esteem&#146; to be joined with Pym and Hampden  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.192). The articles of impeachment were presented on 3 January 1642, and on the following day the king came to the house in person to arrest the members. A pamphlet printed at the time gives a speech which Strode is said to have delivered in his vindication on 3 January, but there can be little doubt that it is a forgery. According to D'Ewes, it was difficult to persuade him to leave the house even when the king's approach was announced.<blockquote>Mr William Strode, the last of the five, being a young man and unmarried, could not be persuaded by his friends for a pretty while to go out; but said that, knowing himself to be innocent, he would stay in the house, though he sealed his innocency with his blood at the door &hellip; nay when no persuasions could prevail with the said Mr Strode, Sir Walter Erle, his entire friend, was fain to take him by the cloak and pull him out of his place and so get him out of the House. (Sanford, 464)</blockquote>After his impeachment Strode was naturally the more embittered against the king, and appears to have been resigned to war in early 1642. When the civil war began he became one of the chief opponents of attempts at accommodation with Charles. He was present at the battle of Edgehill, and was sent up by Essex (with whom he was politically connected) to give a narrative of it to parliament. In the speech which he made to the corporation of London on 27 October 1642 Strode gave a short account of the fight, specially praising the regiments &#145;that were ignominously reproached by the name of Roundheads&#146;, whose courage had restored the fortune of the day  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 11.479). In 1643 his house in Devon was plundered by Sir Ralph Hopton's troops, and the Commons introduced an ordinance for indemnifying him out of Hopton's estate.<br>
<br>Strode remained prominent among the Commons leadership, being a target of Waller's plot (June 1643), and when Pym was buried in Westminster Abbey, Strode was one of his bearers (13 December 1643). In May 1644 he reintroduced the ordinance to renew the powers of the committee of both kingdoms. He was also active against Archbishop Laud, and on 28 November 1644 was employed by the Commons to press the Lords to agree to the ordinance for the archbishop's execution. He is said to have threatened the peers that the mob of the city would force them to pass it if they delayed. <span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, commenting on the incident, accused Strode of making &#145;all the bloody motions&#146;. On 31 January 1645 he was added to the assembly of divines.<br>
<br>Strode died of a fever at Tottenham on 9 September 1645. On 10 September the house ordered that he should have a public funeral and be buried in Westminster Abbey. Whitelocke, who attended the funeral on 22 September, described him as a constant servant to the parliament, just and courteous. Gaspar Hickes, who preached the funeral sermon, dwelt on the disinterestedness of Strode, stated that he spent or lost all he had in the public service, and asserted that his speeches were characterized by a &#145;solid vehemence and a piercing acuteness&#146;  (Hickes). Hickes's estimate of Strode's use of his estate was, however, overly optimistic. His will disposed of significant amounts of cash, valuable plate, horses, a house, and various property rights, manors, and advowsons, the chief beneficiary being his executor, Sir Edward Barkham, baronet. The benefits of the will were to be paid within two years of his death and the end of the wars in England: perhaps a measure to protect his property from further plunder without compensation. At the Restoration, Strode's remains were disinterred by a warrant dated 9 September 1661.<br>
<br>Strode's historical significance lies chiefly in his being a link between the political crises of the 1620s and 1640s, in the combination of his gentry background with religious and constitutional radicalism, and in the role he played in driving the Long Parliament into conflict and war. His character was marked by energy, honesty, passionate commitment, and lack of compromise. Strode was the uncle of the poet William Strode. He is also sometimes confused with William Strode (1589?&#150;1666) of Barrington, near Ilchester, a colonel in parliament's service and a member of the Long Parliament expelled at Pride's Purge.<br>
