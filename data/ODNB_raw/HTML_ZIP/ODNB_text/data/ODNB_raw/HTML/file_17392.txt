<span class="headword">Urard <span class="st"> [Airard]</span> mac Coise</span> <span class="st"> [Erard Maccoisse]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 983<span class="mult">x</span>1023), <span class="occ">Gaelic poet</span>, is recorded in the annals of Ulster and the annals of Tigernach as having died in 990. Other annals record dates of 983 and 988 and even as late as 1023 in the seventeenth-century compilation, the annals of the four masters. The discrepancy has given rise to considerable uncertainty, especially since another poet, the similarly named <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50087/', "Airbertach mac Coise")</script>, the lector and <i>erenagh</i> of Ros Ailithir (Ross Carbery), died in 1016. While there may have been two poets named Urard mac Coise, it seems most likely that the later date arises from confusion with Airbertach mac Coise, the author of a long geographical poem, <span class="italic">Ro fessa hi curp domuin d&uacute;ir</span>, preserved in the twelfth-century <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span>. It is possible that some of the poems ascribed to Urard, composed not long after 1000, were in fact the work of Airbertach or others. Urard's posthumous fame, and later poems retrospectively authored on him, make this an attractive theory.<br>
<br>While a small number of Urard's poems seem to survive, his fame mainly rested on the prose tale <span class="italic">Airec menman Uraird maic Coise</span> (&#145;The stratagem of Urard mac Coise&#146;). Urard's authorship of this tale has been generally accepted and a composition date of some time before 980 has been plausibly suggested. The <span class="italic">Airec menman</span> tale is a third-person narrative in which Urard describes how Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain raiders carry off his possessions and destroy his home at &#145;Cl&aacute;rtha&#146; (probably Clare, in Westmeath). The poet decides to exact compensation by visiting Domnall mac Muirchertaig (<i>d</i>. 980), the Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain king of Tara. Domnall welcomes Urard and asks him for news. The word for both news and stories is the same, <i>sc&eacute;la</i>, and Urard cleverly accepts this opening by listing all the tales he knows. This tale list is, in fact, an important piece of evidence proving the existence of versions of certain narratives by the end of the tenth century. Moreover, it delineates the repertory expected of an <i>ollam</i>, the highest grade of <i>fili</i> or professional poet. The last of Urard's titles is <span class="italic">Orgain cathrach Ma&iacute;l Milscothaig</span> (&#145;The destruction of the fort of M&aacute;el Milscothach&#146;). The king has never heard this tale and asks Urard to recite it. As the tale progresses, it becomes clear that M&aacute;el Milscothach, M&aacute;el of the Sweet Words, is in fact Urard himself. M&aacute;el Milscothach successfully seeks reparation at the court of the king of Tara, following the destruction of his home. At the d&eacute;nouement of this tale within a tale, Urard tells Domnall that he is indeed that king. Domnall, taking the hint, apprehends the wrongdoers and brings the nobles of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain together. The latter compensate the poet for his loss. Furthermore, at a council of professional poets and judges, the king attempts to fix the compensation and honour price owed to a poet. The matter is eventually handed over to Flann, the lector of Clonmacnoise. Since the annals of Tigernach mention that Urard died in penitence at Clonmacnoise, it is possible that he may have had links with the monastery. In any event, Flann decides that Urard should receive complete compensation for his losses, as well as an honour price equal to the king of Tara. This ruling should, furthermore, apply to every <i>ollam</i>.<br>
<br>It has been argued that this tale represents an attempt by the <i>filid</i>, the professional poets, to force back changes in Irish society inimical to the status of their order. It has been convincingly shown, however, that the claims set forth in <span class="italic">Airec menman</span> are innovatory and an attempt to enhance further the high status of the <i>filid</i>. Eighth-century legal material, dealing with the status of <i>filid</i>, assigns to an <i>ollam</i> an honour price equivalent to a petty king. The plea in <span class="italic">Airec menman</span>, that this should be replaced with an honour price equivalent to the king of Tara, reflects the profound changes that were transforming ninth- and tenth-century Irish society. The petty kingdoms were sinking to the level of lordships in an area of wider authority. The overkings, with greater economic resources, had become the most significant lay patrons. For a poet such as Urard, it was important to take advantage of this and become associated with the greater kings.<br>
<br>Urard's reputation as the confidant of great kings was such that the chief poet of the annals became associated not only with Domnall mac Muirchertaig, but with his immediate successor in the high-kingship, M&aacute;el Sechnaill mac Domnaill (<i>d</i>. 1022), the last southern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill king of Tara. In these, late, sources, Urard is awarded the revenues of Ireland for a year by M&aacute;el Sechnaill, a paradigm of generosity. A poem in praise of M&aacute;el Sechnaill is retrospectively authored on Urard. Moreover, a version of this tale is contained in the seventeenth-century annals of Clonmacnoise.<br>
<br>Urard was imagined as the ideal <i>fili</i>. Ironically, this image was self-created. It was eagerly perpetuated by Urard's <i>fili</i> successors for many generations; a version of <span class="italic">Airec menman</span> was written as late as the end of the sixteenth century, on the eve of the destruction of the <i>filid</i>. For six centuries Urard mac Coise was an eloquent supporter of the privileges of the professional poets.<br>
