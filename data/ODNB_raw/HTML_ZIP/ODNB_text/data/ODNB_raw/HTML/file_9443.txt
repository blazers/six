<span class="headword">Finch, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1563), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the second son of Sir William Finch, knighted for military service in 1513, of The Moat, Canterbury, Kent; his mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Cromer and widow of Sir Richard Lovelace. In 1547 he married Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter of Sir Thomas Moyle of Eastwell, Kent; they had at least five sons and one daughter. Their third born son was the author and lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9436/', "Sir Henry Finch")</script>. By this marriage he came into possession of Eastwell and Pekmansten in Kent in 1559. His early training was as a soldier, accompanying his father to both Scotland and the continent. On 19 June 1553 he was granted the rights as heir of his father, and he was knighted on 2 October following.<br>
<br>Finch was involved in the suppression of Wyatt's rebellion in Kent. In 1554 he was given commissions of the peace, of oyer and terminer, and of the sewers, all in Kent, which were regularly renewed during his life. In his position as commissioner for oyer and terminer he was an official at the indictment of several of those involved in Wyatt's rebellion. In 1555 he was employed with Sir Henry Crisp to transport several rebels to the Marshalsea, for which he received a letter of thanks from the council. In August 1557 he was granted a tenement in the lordship of Warkworth, Northumberland. In January 1558 he was commanded to conduct a levy of 100 footmen to Dover. After Elizabeth's accession he was appointed charge of the manor and park of Canterbury in Kent. On 9 December 1558 Alvise Priuli, secretary and executor of the late Cardinal Pole, wrote to Cecil requesting that Finch be directed to deliver Pole's goods from the archbishopric's park and manor. In December 1558 the privy council ordered him to examine an alleged traitor in Ashforth, Kent, and the following February he was appointed to investigate Nicholas Harpsfield, the archdeacon of Canterbury, who was believed to be stirring sedition; Finch examined his armour, household, and transactions. He was MP for Canterbury in 1559, and in October that year he received a commission to survey some of the possessions of the vacant see of Canterbury.<br>
<br>In 1563, when Elizabeth was aiding the Huguenots and occupying Newhaven (Le Havre) in France, Finch was appointed knight-marshal in place of Sir Adrian Poynings. He sent his half-brother Erasmus Finch and kinsman Thomas Finch to take charge before his arrival. On 19 March he departed for Newhaven on the <i>Greyhound</i> with 200 soldiers, among whom were several notables, a nephew of Warwick, and two brothers of Lord Wentworth. Bad weather drove them back, and the ship sank in Rye Harbour, killing Finch and nearly all on board. There are two accounts of this tragedy. Stow says that Finch and his friends induced the captain to proceed into the haven &#145;before the tide&#146; thereby causing the disaster. However, Cuthbert Vaughan wrote to Cecil that a fisherman from Rye had warned the captain that it would take two hours for the tide to be high enough for a safe entry&#151;to no avail, as the captain bade him &#145;to heed his fish&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, Elizabeth, 6.257). Finch's death caused grief for Warwick, Cecil, and Lord Cobham, and Richard Griffith wrote a ballad about the tragedy. He was buried in Eastwell church, Kent. A loyal servant to the Tudors, he seems to have been happy to conform to the prevailing religious climate.<br>
