<span class="headword">Walker,  Horace</span>  (1910&#150;1994), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and administrator</span>, was born on 16 August 1910 in Aberdeen, the youngest of five children of William Telfer Walker (<i>c</i>.1865&#150;<i>c</i>.1937), a sales representative, and his wife, Sarah Jackson (<i>c</i>.1867&#150;1949). From Aberdeen grammar school he went, in 1928, to Aberdeen University, and graduated with honours in English (MA, 1932) before studying divinity (BD, 1935). He worked for three years as Scottish travelling organizer of the Student Christian Movement (SCM), which then encompassed both liberal and evangelical theology. The appointment was a joint arrangement between the SCM and the home board of the Church of Scotland, whose Aberdeen presbytery ordained Walker in December 1935.<br>
<br>In 1938&#150;9 Walker was assistant minister at St Mary's, Dundee, and when the Second World War broke out was in the process of induction (completed 27 September 1939) into his first parish charge at West Port, Hawick. He remained there for most of the war, apart from secondment to Orkney with the Church of Scotland huts and canteens serving the forces. Hawick introduced him to a Scottish regional culture as distinctive as Aberdeen's and to his future wife, Annie Wyles Duncan (<i>b</i>. 1918), a nurse whom he married on 28 April 1945, shortly after he had moved back to Aberdeen. They had two daughters. From 1944 to 1948 he was minister of the church extension parish of High Hilton, an Aberdeen area developed between the wars.<br>
<br>Walker left the parish ministry to become secretary-depute of the Church of Scotland's home board in 1948 and from 1 November 1957 to August 1977 was its secretary, a managing co-ordinator, and executive director as far as Presbyterian structures allowed. He was bureaucrat and diplomat, even entrepreneur, involved in creating nearly fifty new parishes and in 150 building projects at a time when urban redevelopment, new town projects, Glasgow overspill, and suburban expansion changed the face of Scotland.<br>
<br>Walker's ministry extended beyond planning and administering these changes. He sought to extend as well as organize concepts of ministry and to integrate parish based church life with initiatives of a different kind. These tried to respond to social and intellectual trends as well as population changes. His commitment to traditional church extension which had sustained and often revived the Church of Scotland in inter-war and post-war years went with enthusiasm for industrial and hospital chaplaincy and church involvement with science, technology, and the arts, as well as conference and lay training centres. There were initiatives for groups from immigrants to weekend skiers, as well as a sustained &#145;Tell Scotland&#146; movement.<br>
<br>These endeavours flourished in an age when church membership in Scotland was still around its peak (a decline set in from the early 1960s) and residual attachment and respect remained strong among those with no formal connection. This approach recognized that many congregational activities had become less relevant to life patterns among a more mobile population, though it depended for long-term viability on the ability of traditional parishes to pay their own way and sustain central funds.<br>
<br>Most of the initiatives remained vigorous when Walker retired, though further expansion and experiment were limited by straitened circumstances in the church and a less universally friendly perception of it. Hospital chaplaincy thrived but industrial chaplaincy, originally linked to Scottish heavy industry, found that it was not only parish life that had to cope with social and economic change. One fresh success was a chaplaincy to the North Sea oil industry. Some other initiatives wilted or were scaled down, but Walker's concepts continued to influence the Church of Scotland's perception of its history, theology, and mission, most spectacularly demonstrated in its ownership of a theatre and arts centre through the wall from the building accepted by tradition as John Knox's house.<br>
<br>In demeanour Horace Walker could show a reserve which only briefly concealed a warm heart. Literally and metaphorically he walked upright, visible from afar by a shining head of white hair unthinned with age. He was a receptive listener, generally shrewd in judgement, and strong willed but fair-minded. Some of those working with him called him prophetic. He was not most notable as visionary of the distant scene, but as team leader, planner, and negotiator with a liberal evangelical faith. He could share visions and work out practical steps to give them substance. He also achieved considerable success in harmonizing parish efforts of different trends in the church, notably the Iona Community emphasis on social gospel and the growth of a self-conscious conservative evangelicalism.<br>
<br>After retirement in 1977 Walker was chairman of the ecumenical Scottish Churches Council for four years before ill health weakened him. He died in Edinburgh after years of increasing infirmity on 5 December 1994 and was cremated on 8 December at Warriston crematorium. He was survived by his wife. Aberdeen University conferred a DD on him in 1967. He was made OBE in 1978.<br>
