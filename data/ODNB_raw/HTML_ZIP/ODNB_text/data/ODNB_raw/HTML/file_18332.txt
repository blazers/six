</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mathews,  Thomas</span>  (1676&#150;1751), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, eldest son of Colonel Edward Mathews (<i>d</i>. 1700), and Jane, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/665/', "Sir Thomas Armstrong")</script>, was born in October 1676 at Llandaff Court, Glamorgan, the seat of the family for many generations, later the palace of the bishops of Llandaff. His father was a fervent whig convert; his wife's father was a whig martyr, executed for his thoroughgoing complicity in the Rye House plot. Mathews entered the navy about 1690, on the <i>Albemarle</i> with Sir Francis Wheeler. On 31 October 1699 Admiral Matthew Aylmer promoted him lieutenant of his flagship, the <i>Boyne</i>. The promotion was confirmed on 16 March 1700 when the Admiralty appointed him to the <i>Deal Castle</i>.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer17031717"></a>Early career, 1703&#150;1717</h2>Mathews took post on 24 May 1703 in the <i>Yarmouth</i> in the West Indies under John Graydon; he remained with Graydon's squadron as it suffered near ruin from Caribbean summer, chilling September fog off Newfoundland, and a stormy passage home. He commanded the frigate <i>Kinsale</i> in the channel in 1704, and after that the <i>Dover</i> (50 guns), in which he crossed to North America, convoying home the New England trade in late 1706. March 1708 saw the <i>Dover</i> with the squadron under Sir George Byng that was hurrying to Scotland to prevent Forbin's Dunkirk fleet from landing a Franco-Jacobite invasion force. On sighting Byng's ships off the Firth of Forth, Forbin fled northwards. The heavier British ships were unable to close, but the <i>Dover</i> and another clean ship did so. The cannonading, which was plainly audible ashore, began off Montrose at about 4 p.m. on 13 March. Mathews tried to advance to engage <i>Le Mars</i>, in which he presumed (correctly) the Pretender was embarked, but French warships blocked his path. The chase continued during the night past Aberdeen, but in the end only the <i>Salisbury</i> was forced to surrender. Byng ordered Mathews to scout further north, a foul-weather mission that found nothing because the invasion force had headed home. After a brief command of the <i>Gloucester</i>, Mathews moved to a new ship, the <i>Chester</i> (54 guns), in 1709. In late March he was with Lord Dursley in the Soundings when Du Guay Trouin was sighted. Most of Trouin's ships outsailed Dursley's and escaped, but Mathews caught up with the <i>Gloire</i> (44 guns) and after staying close through the night engaged and captured her.<br>
<br>In 1710 the <i>Chester</i>, under Commodore George Martin, participated in the conquest of Nova Scotia, playing a prominent role in the capture of Port Royal, which was renamed Annapolis Royal. When Martin went home Mathews remained as senior officer on the New England station; he joined the fleet that came to Boston in the following summer under Sir Hovenden Walker for the purpose of attacking Quebec. Cruising at the entrance of the Gulf of St Lawrence in July 1711, Mathews captured a small French warship whose master was subsequently induced by Walker to serve as chief pilot for guiding the fleet up the river. The expedition was terminated after seven of its troop transports smashed upon the north-west shore. A few weeks later the <i>Chester</i> was assigned to convoy home the New England mast ships. When the ship was paid off Mathews settled down to life as a squire at Llandaff Court. Although he had found time for marriage in 1705 to Henrietta Burgess (<i>d</i>. 1737), daughter of a physician of Antigua and Shoreditch, he had been much at sea and compiled an enviable record in seamanship, combat, and command.<h2>
<a name="Mediterraneancommand17181743"></a>Mediterranean command, 1718&#150;1743</h2>Mathews returned to duty in early 1718 and as captain of the <i>Kent</i> (70 guns) went out to the Mediterranean with the fleet commanded by Byng. In the action off Cape Passaro the <i>Kent</i>&#151;again Mathews commanded a fast ship&#151;was one of four ordered ahead during the night to catch the Spanish main body. On the next morning (1 August) Mathews engaged and took possession of the <i>San Carlos</i>, and then assisted the <i>Superb</i> in engaging and capturing the Spanish admiral. Thus Mathews had a distinguished share in the great victory, and afterwards Byng appointed him commander of the small squadron responsible for blockading Messina. Although he was unable to capture George Camocke, rear-admiral in the Spanish service, who escaped in a small boat, his squadron performed diligently and effectively for over a year. In August 1719 he was ordered to cruise off Palermo to intercept incoming Spanish supplies. The <i>Kent</i> returned to England in 1720.<br>
<br>Mathews was next appointed commodore of a squadron ordered to assist the East India Company in suppressing piracy in the Indian Ocean. Immediately upon arriving in the <i>Lion</i> (64 guns) at Bombay on 27 August 1721, he quarrelled with the governor over whether the fort or the ship should salute first. Continuing hostility marked subsequent relations between him and the company; such conflicts were not unusual, but Mathews's contentiousness seems excessive. The joint operation of 1721 involving Portuguese troops from Goa against the troublesome Angria on the Malabar coast would probably have failed anyhow. It was the complete failure of Mathews's subsequent cruise against the pirates round Madagascar in 1722 that did greatest injury to his reputation, especially because some of the <i>Lion's</i> movements were evidently designed to generate personal trading profits rather than hunt down pirates. Back in England in 1724 he was court martialled and mulcted four months' pay for misdemeanours, one of the charges being that he had received disallowed merchandise on board a navy ship. The directors of the company sued him in civil court for &pound;13,677 as recompense for his illegal trading, but intercession by the Admiralty in 1728 led to the matter's being dropped. It is very likely that Mathews accepted the East Indies command in order to amass a fortune, and that having made some money&#151;one need not imagine that he netted the figure calculated by the company&#151;he sought no further employment at sea. In 1727 and again in 1734 he contested the tory-controlled Cardiff Borough seat on behalf of the whig interest but was unsuccessful on both occasions.<br>
<br>After refusing an offer to serve in the Russian navy because the empress would not make him an admiral, Mathews, in 1736, became dockyard commissioner at Chatham. His wife died in 1737, and on 9 November 1738 he married Millicent (<i>d</i>. after 1751), daughter and coheir of John Fuller, formerly sheriff of London. Mathews was an effective commissioner, popular with the yard workers yet capable of satisfying his Navy Board colleagues and his superiors at the Admiralty.<br>
<br>With Britain at war with Spain and war with France likely, Mathews, who had been passed over for promotion to flag-rank in the 1730s, was promoted at one step on 13 March 1742 vice-admiral of the red (full restoration of rank), and was also made commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, and plenipotentiary to the king of Sardinia and the states of Italy. Only an acute shortage of capable senior flag officers excused the elevation of someone who had not seen sea service for eighteen years. In favour of Mathews, however, were his performance as a commander at sea before 1720, his experience as a dockyard commissioner, and his knowledge of the Mediterranean theatre. He was well thought of by Sir Charles Wager and was politically connected with William Pulteney (later earl of Bath), who was then in ascendancy.<br>
<br>Although Mathews comes down to posterity, as Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond remarked, &#145;with a cheap tag attached to his name that he was stupid&#146;  (Richmond, 3.254), his performance both as theatre commander and plenipotentiary displayed sense, foresight, diligence, and a high degree of success. The dual assignment was complex and strewn with pitfalls. Chiefly he was charged with frustrating Spanish military designs on Italy; the inshore waters between Marseilles and Genoa were therefore the primary focus. Yet British warships were needed far and wide, from the coast of Spain to the Adriatic. Mathews's crusty disposition did not please the diplomatic corps but may have materially benefited the cause: when he ordered Captain William Martin to Naples to &#145;use his utmost to lay the said city in ashes, unless the King of the two Sicilies&#146; agreed immediately to stop assisting the enemy, the threat was believed and the purpose achieved  (ibid., 1.212). A similar threat at Genoa was also effective. Above all, for twenty months Mathews managed to maintain a correct balance of concentration and dispersal, not allowing the large Franco-Spanish fleet at Toulon to deter him from deploying most of his ships on the mundane tasks of sea power. Only when he was sure the combined fleet was being readied for sea in December 1743 did he order a concentration.<h2>
<a name="Toulon1744"></a>Toulon, 1744</h2>Effective intelligence arrangements sped the news of the Toulon fleet's weighing, but it took two days for the British fleet to clear Hy&egrave;res Roads and even then, on 10 February 1744, the light, variable winds prevented formation of a line. Fortunately an easterly breeze prevented Admiral de Court (commanding sixteen French and twelve Spanish ships of the line) from taking advantage; instead, he steered away southward in line ahead. Yet he did not flee, which his ships could have done thanks to cleaner hulls. At 3 p.m. Mathews ordered a line abreast and headed downwind towards the combined fleet. The situation, foreseen in his orders, permitted him to treat the French as enemies even though no war between Britain and France was yet declared. When darkness fell, both fleets brought to. Mathews's signal for the line abreast was still flying when he ordered the halt. Vice-Admiral Richard Lestock, whose rear squadron (eight of the line) was separated far to windward, brought to immediately instead of using the favouring wind to achieve the line abreast. Irregular drifting during the night put the rear squadron even further away.<br>
<br>At 8.30 a.m. on 11 February Mathews signalled for a line ahead. A battle plainly loomed. Rear-Admiral William Rowley attained his station in the van, but despite Mathews's signals to make more sail (reinforced twice by a lieutenant sent in a boat) Lestock's squadron remained far behind. By noon Mathews concluded that the aim of the Franco-Spanish fleet was to lure him away from the coast so that Spanish troops could be embarked for an invasion of Italy. The fleet might also have been trying to join with a Brest squadron known to have sailed, in which case he would be overmatched. In any case, as a British admiral with a superior force he simply had to try to bring on an engagement.<br>
<br>After a shouted conversation with Captain James Cornewall of the <i>Marlborough</i> next astern, Mathews hoisted the signal to engage and led his centre division towards the Spanish flagship. By isolating the Spanish ships he might induce the French to slow down to assist them and thus bring on a general engagement. Rowley steered for the French admiral. Through all this Mathews kept the signal for the line ahead flying, a proceeding much criticized later, though it may have encouraged three captains of the van to stretch forward to inhibit the half-dozen leading French ships from doubling back. Because gaps developed in the Spanish portion of line and the British van fell upon the rear of the French portion, some British ships lacked opponents. Far in the rear were four Spanish ships&#151;so far behind that Lestock's squadron could have cut them off. But he chose not to engage and they slowly rejoined their admiral unopposed.<br>
<br>Only a few ships bore the brunt of the battle. Mathews's flagship, the <i>Namur</i>, was substantially disabled aloft and her captain lost an arm. The <i>Marlborough</i> was heavily engaged with the Spanish flagship and suffered severe damage and casualties, including Captain Cornewall, who was killed. All in all Mathews and Rowley and six or seven captains of the van and centre, including Edward Hawke, were in the thick of it. Astern of Mathews four captains of his division kept too great a distance. Lestock's squadron missed the battle.<br>
<br>In the final phase de Court tacked, realizing that he must shield the Spaniards, and the move was successful. Both sides made repairs during the night. The enemy's course change had placed Lestock in the lead and the next day his undamaged squadron moved out ahead. The chase forced the Spanish to cease towing a disabled warship, which Mathews ordered be burnt. The following morning, 13 February, Lestock was sure, though 12 miles distant, that he would overtake the fleeing Spanish because they were trying to protect some crippled ships. Just before noon, however, Mathews called off the chase. He believed that the Riviera blockade held priority and was also worried that the Brest fleet might be near. It was a bad decision. The Brest squadron was not in the Mediterranean and a strong adverse wind frustrated the attempted return to the Riviera. Although most of the enemy would have undoubtedly escaped, four or five crippled Spanish men-of-war must have been captured had the chase continued.<br>
<br>Mathews wrote to Lestock straight away, asking why he had brought to on the evening before the battle without achieving a line abreast, the result being that his squadron had fallen astern &#145;full five Miles &hellip;, which is notorious to the whole Fleet&#146;. He further asked why Lestock did not respond to the signal to engage by bearing down on the four Spanish stragglers. In response Lestock pointedly criticized Mathews's inadequate and contradictory signals, and added that there were four unengaged ships of his centre division which could have been ordered to deal with the lagging Spaniards. This provoked an angry reply: &#145;You would not yourself do it, or order any of your Division to do, what you are pleased to tell me I ought to have done&#146;, yet &#145;it was absolutely in your Power&#146; to oppose those four ships  (<span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 22).<h2>
<a name="Parliamentaryinquiryandcourtmartial17451746"></a>Parliamentary inquiry and court martial, 1745&#150;1746</h2>On 16 March 1744 Mathews suspended Lestock and ordered him home. Next day he sent copies of their correspondence to the duke of Newcastle, then secretary of state for the southern department, and asked to be ordered home to defend himself against Lestock's accusations. Lestock arrived in London three months before Mathews and quickly published his version of the battle in a long pamphlet. Nevertheless public opinion ran strongly in Mathews's favour. It appears that most people accepted the view that the signal to engage plus the example set by the centre and van required Lestock to fall upon the Spanish ships that were within his reach. Lestock defended himself chiefly by conveying the impression that Mathews as fleet commander had been sloppy, reckless, and impatient; the battle, he contended, could have been fought with a complete, well ordered line if only Mathews had waited for him to join.<br>
<br>An unstable political situation enabled Lestock and his friends to push successfully for a parliamentary inquiry. It was a major political event; hearings occupied the House of Commons on two full days every week from 12 March to 4 April 1745 and these were followed by passionate debates. This inquiry was an extraordinary innovation, never repeated, in which naval operations were examined in the political forum prior to courts martial. During the proceedings Mathews sat as MP for Glamorgan, having wrested the seat from its traditional tory control in a by-election victory in January. This gave him no advantage, however, because it set all tories against him while failing to bring solid allegiance from the faction-ridden whigs. Henry Fox, a rising star in debate, emerged as an outspoken advocate of Lestock. Although Mathews fared well in the pamphlet war, the parliamentary inquiry damaged him severely. Lestock's cool manner of reasoning impressed the MPs. Mathews was perceived as &#145;a hot, brave, imperious, dull, confused fellow&#146;  (Walpole, 19.33), and he harmed his credibility by unwillingness to criticize the four captains of his own division who had failed to engage more closely.<br>
<br>Hundreds of witnesses were brought home from the Mediterranean for the courts martial. Seven captains and four lieutenants were tried in 1745 at Chatham, where the trials of the admirals were feverishly anticipated. For two days in October the yard was at a standstill as the workers &#145;assembled at the dock gate, to the number of about eight hundred, and examined everyone that went in or out whether for Mathews or Lestock, and were all strong for Mr Mathews&#146;. The Board of Admiralty, pondering whether there might be riots &#145;if upon the courts martial it should appear that Mr Lestock has not been so much to blame as thought and Mr Mathews should be found guilty&#146;, ordered the venue changed to Deptford  (Hattendorf, 522). Key members of the board apparently contrived to ensure that the composition of the court for the admirals' trials would not favour Mathews  (Sandwich to Bedford, 22 Oct 1745, Woburn MSS, 10, fols. 110&#150;11). In the event Lestock was acquitted of all charges on 20 June 1746 and, despite his poor health, immediately appointed to an important command. That did not bode well for Mathews.<br>
<br>During his trial, which lasted four months, Mathews is reported to have &#145;calmed all his passions&#146;, becoming &#145;sensible of the advantages of an even temper and decent behaviour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Du Cane MSS</span>, 135). Nevertheless the court, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, presumed that a classic line-of-battle action could have been fought. They excused Mathews's decision to attack with only part of his force on the technical ground of superior strength, but rejected his claim that he &#145;had no chance of bringing the French to action, unless by making the signal for engaging and bearing down&#146; on the Spaniards. More reasonably, the court also faulted him for failing to coerce the four lagging captains of his division into closer engagement and neglecting to stay in close touch with the fleeing enemy during the moonlight night of 12 February. On 22 October 1746 he was deemed to be a principal cause of the miscarriage and was cashiered. Mathews had clearly made many mistakes during and after the battle. The astonishing thing is that Lestock was found completely faultless.<h2>
<a name="Aftermathandfinalyears17471751"></a>Aftermath and final years, 1747&#150;1751</h2>It is undeniable that Mathews lacked some of the qualities wanted in a commander-in-chief. His imperious temper showed too readily, and not only when talking: his official letters from the Mediterranean were too often disfigured by expressions of wrath. Worse, he allowed a long-developed dislike of Lestock to prevent a discussion of possible tactics before the battle. The Admiralty and the leaders of government must share some responsibility in this regard. The mutual animosity of the two men was well known. Mathews, upon accepting command, had asked for Lestock to be removed, and Lestock himself had asked for a new assignment. The complacent assumption that they would co-operate for the good of the service proved disastrous.<br>
<br>It is said that Mathews accepted the outcome of his trial with equanimity, at least on the surface. He could take comfort in knowing that his method of attack was the only way to bring on an engagement and that he had risked life and limb while his critic and accuser remained aloof. His bluntness was evidently matched with natural honesty. He readily admitted to the court that under pressure of combat he had made mistakes. All in all there seems to have been a genuine basis for his popular support, and George II remained grateful to him for his services to the allied cause. Though parliamentary opinion still flowed strongly against him he found friends among those who were inclined to perceive his disgrace and Lestock's exoneration as high-handed acts of an increasingly powerful political combination at the Admiralty.<br>
<br>By arrangement Mathews agreed to give up his Glamorgan seat and accept Carmarthen Boroughs for the election of 1747, and was thus returned to parliament. In 1749, feeling himself in failing health, he settled in Bloomsbury Square, London, and there he died on 2 October 1751. He was buried in St George's, Bloomsbury. His only child, Thomas William, by his first wife, resigned his commission as major in the army upon his father's disgrace in 1746 but sat three years for Glamorgan (1756&#150;9).<br>
