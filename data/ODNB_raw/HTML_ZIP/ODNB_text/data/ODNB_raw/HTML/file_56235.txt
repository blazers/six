<span class="headword">Haverfield <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Scarlett]</span>,  Evelina</span>  (1867&#150;1920), <span class="occ">suffragette and aid worker</span>, was born at Inverlochy Castle, Kingussie, on 9 August 1867, the third daughter of William Frederick Scarlett, third Baron Abinger (1826&#150;1892), landowner and army officer, and his wife, Helen (<i>c</i>.1840&#150;1915), daughter of Commodore George Allan Magruder of the US navy. She was educated at home by governesses and in 1880 attended a school in D&uuml;sseldorf, becoming fluent in German. Spending much of the year on the family's Scottish estate, she was a keen sportswoman, especially adept at riding astride. On 10 February 1887 in the parish church of St Stephen's, Kensington, she married Henry Wykeham Brook Tunstall Haverfield (<i>c</i>.1847&#150;1895), a major in the Royal Artillery; the couple moved to Dorset, and had two sons (John, who was killed in 1915, and Brook, who emigrated to Canada). Widowed in 1895, on 8 July 1899 in the parish church at Caundle Marsh, Dorset, she married John Henry Balguy (1859&#150;1933), another Royal Artillery major. Within a month of the marriage she enacted a document by which she reverted to the name Haverfield. She spent two years with her husband in South Africa during the South African War, and while there formed a retirement camp for horses left to die on the veldt. Evelina Haverfield returned to an active country life in Dorset and, although she had never previously evinced any interest in politics, at some point joined the Sherborne branch of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. As the campaign for women's enfranchisement gathered momentum, she transferred her allegiance to the militant section of the movement in March 1908, and after attending a large rally in the Albert Hall, joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). In June 1909 she was arrested after taking part in a WSPU deputation to the House of Commons. With that of Mrs Pankhurst, hers was treated as a test case, Sir Robert Cecil defending her on the grounds that she had been wrongfully arrested while exercising a constitutional right. She was found guilty, however, and fined; the case went to appeal, and the fine was upheld. Although she was determined to go to prison, the fine was paid without her consent. She was arrested again in November 1910, charged with assaulting a policeman after taking part in a WSPU demonstration in Parliament Square. She denied neither the charge nor the suggestion that she had said that the next time she would bring a revolver. She was sentenced to a fine or a month's imprisonment, but again the fine was paid without her consent. Imprisonment for the suffrage cause was at length achieved in November 1911, after she had attempted to break a police cordon by leading police horses out of their ranks; she spent two weeks in Holloway. Sylvia Pankhurst noted of Mrs Haverfield that:<blockquote>When she first joined the Suffragette movement her expression was cold and proud &hellip; I was repelled when she told me she felt no affection for her children. During her years in the Suffrage movement her sympathies so broadened that she seemed to have undergone a rebirth. (Pankhurst, 345)</blockquote>On the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 Evelina Haverfield founded the Women's Emergency Corps and in late 1914 served briefly as commander-in-chief of the Women's Reserve Ambulance (Green Cross Corps), which was a founding unit of the future Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. In May 1915 she joined Elsie Inglis and the Scottish Women's Hospital unit in Serbia, working there until forced out in February 1916 by the German advance. Undeterred, in August Mrs Haverfield sailed for Russia, in charge of the unit's transport column, which comprised seventy-five women noted for their smart uniforms and shorn locks. She herself is invariably described as being small, neat, and aristocratic, able to command devotion from her troops, although some of her peers, not so enamoured, were scathing of her ability. By March 1917 the harshness of the weather, combined with the disrepair of the vehicles and internal feuding, led Mrs Haverfield to return to Britain where, for the remainder of the war, she campaigned for the Serbian cause. After the armistice Mrs Haverfield founded an orphanage in Serbia and was working there when she contracted pneumonia and died on 21 March 1920 at Baijna Bashta, where she was buried. A plaque in her orphanage building, later a co-operative health centre, commemorates her work for the Serbian people.<br>
