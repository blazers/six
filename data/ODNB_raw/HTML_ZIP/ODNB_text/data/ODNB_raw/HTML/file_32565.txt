<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Corbett,  Edward James <span class="st"> [Jim]</span></span>  (1875&#150;1955), <span class="occ">hunter and conservationist</span>, was born at Naini Tal, India, on 25 July 1875, the eighth child of Christopher William Corbett (1822&#150;1881), a postmaster, and his wife, Mary Jane (1837?&#150;1924), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Prussia, widow of Charles Doyle. From childhood, Jim (as he was commonly known) was closely acquainted with the life of the jungle, spending many nights alone in it and growing accustomed to the cries and calls of bird and beast, and studying their natural history. He also hunted, shooting birds and, later, big game, killing his first leopard at the age of eleven. Initially educated by his mother and half-sister Mary, he progressed to the Diocesan Boys' School (now Sherwood College), Naini Tal. He had ambitions to be an engineer but a lack of family money prevented this and, in 1895, he joined the Bengal and North-Western Railway as a fuel inspector at Bihar; later he was promoted to trans-shipment inspector at Mokameh Ghat, Bengal. In the First World War, with the rank of captain, he helped to recruit a labour corps of Kumaoni hillfolk, and commanded his own unit of 500 in France in 1917: he brought 499 safely home. Promoted to major, he served in the Waziristan campaign of the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919&#150;21).<br>
<br>A legacy enabled Corbett to quit the railways and buy into the partnership of a Naini Tal hardware and estate agency business, and devote his time to the welfare of the people of the Kumaon region. He and his sister Maggie, with half-sister Mary, ran a surgery at Kaladhungi, the family winter home in the <i>terai</i>. Near by was the dilapidated village of Choti Haldwani. Corbett bought the village and surrounding farmland, turning them into a successful and much admired model community which still exists. He built (with his own hands, working alongside the local people) a wild-pig-proof stone wall 6 feet high and 6 miles long, designed and installed a field irrigation system, and experimented with agriculture, bringing in seeds and cuttings from trips he made to British East Africa, where he hunted in Kenya and Tanganyika with his lifelong friend Sir Percy Wyndham. Not all his experiments were fruitful. Introduced African bananas, grapefruit, vines, and coffee all failed miserably but a large-kernelled maize was a considerable success.<br>
<br>In Naini Tal, Corbett's estate agency business flourished by the letting of houses during the hot summer to Europeans escaping the heat of the plains. This business success in turn afforded him the opportunity to return to the jungle to hunt. He was an expert shot and keen angler, especially for mahseer. Over the 1920s he gradually realized the damage being done to the environment of Kumaon by deforestation and increasing human population, and he began to preach conservationist theories and to criticize British policies. His theories were dismissed but he continued to pursue them, publish them, and cause controversy, often to his detriment. He took against shooting for sport and turned to big game photography, using both still and movie cameras. With the infinite patience and courage of a hunter, using bait animals and his ability to call up leopards and tigers by imitating their calls, he took the first moving pictures of a rare white tiger at a distance of 30 feet, without a telephoto lens.<br>
<br>Although eschewing shooting, Corbett accepted responsibility for hunting down man-eating tigers and leopards, much to the anxious chagrin of his sister Maggie, with whom he lived all of his life and whose obsessive possessiveness of her brother prevented him from marrying. Between 1907 and 1945 he dispatched at least twelve man-eaters. Wiry and incredibly fit, he endured terrible hardships and sometimes illness in the execution of his errands of mercy. He frequently went without adequate sleep or food for days on end, and spent many long nights hunched on a makeshift platform in a tree overlooking a kill, sometimes the gruesome remains of the most recent human victim. He was in continual danger and more than once was nearly killed. His resolve and bravery became legendary and brought him the deepest affection and even worship of the Kumaoni people, who still regard him as a <i>sadhu</i> or holy man. He maintained that no tiger or leopard was by nature a man-eater but became one through injury or by the effect of human environmental factors such as careless hunting or habitat destruction.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Corbett was too old for active service but he was, from 1940 to 1942, actively involved in the recruitment of over 1400 soldiers for a Pioneer Corps. Later, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, he trained British troops in jungle survival techniques in readiness for the invasion of Burma. His survival lessons included warning against bathing in jungle pools because they often housed sleeping pythons and the issuing of silk stockings to combat troops as the fine mesh of the silk prevented leeches from gaining purchase on the skin: the latter recommendation was not officially sanctioned.<br>
<br>Under the instigation of Lady Violet Haig, wife of the provincial governor, Corbett wrote a thin, privately published booklet on his man-eater hunting escapades. Entitled <span class="italic">Jungle Stories</span>, it was modest yet thrilling and filled with jungle lore as well as ripping-yarn excitement. This developed into three commercially published books: <span class="italic">Man-Eaters of Kumaon</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">The Temple Tiger</span> (1954).<br>
<br>In 1947 Corbett and his sister Maggie decided to leave India and settle at Nyeri, Kenya, living near relatives and renting a cottage in the grounds of the Outspan Hotel, which had originally been built for Lord Baden-Powell. Corbett was made an honorary game warden, and devoted much of his time to photographing and filming wildlife, and to writing. In addition to the works already mentioned, he published the autobiographical <span class="italic">My India</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Jungle Lore</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Tree Tops</span> (1955), an account of the visit of Princess Elizabeth and the duke of Edinburgh to the famous game-viewing lodge near Nyeri. He was with the royal party on the night the princess ascended to the throne. Of his books in English well over 2 million have been sold, with translations in eighteen languages.<br>
<br>Tall, slim, and blue-eyed, Corbett was a handsome, scrupulously honest, and modest man, kind and generous, and beloved and admired by all who knew him, no matter what their rank. He was awarded the volunteer decoration (1920), the kaisar-i-Hind gold medal (1928), the OBE (1942), and the CIE (1946), and was granted the freedom of the forests in India, a privilege given only once previously to a European. In 1957 the Indian government renamed the Hailey National Park, the famous tiger sanctuary in Garhwal, the Corbett National Park &#145;in memory of one who had dedicated his life to the service of the simple hill folks of Kumaon&#146;. Corbett died at the Mount Kenya Hospital, Nyeri, on 19 April 1955, and lies in the same cemetery as Baden-Powell, at St Peter's Church, Nyeri. He is today considered one of the earliest conservationists and the father of the movement to save the tiger from extinction.<br>
