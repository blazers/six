<span class="headword">Purvey,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1354&#150;1414), <span class="occ">Wycliffite heretic</span>, is usually identified with the John Purvey of Lathbury, Buckinghamshire, who was permitted to enter all priestly ranks on 13 March 1377 or 1378  (Lincoln reg. 12, fol. 161); he may have been a member of the Buckinghamshire family of Purefoy. No direct contemporary evidence establishes his education, though it is possible (and has usually been assumed) that he gained his acquaintance with Wyclif's ideas in Oxford. Purvey's name appears with those of Nicholas Hereford, John Aston, William Swinderby, and John Parker in the mandate of 10 August 1387 issued by Henry Wakefield, bishop of Worcester, to prevent their preaching. A commission of 1388&#150;9 apparently sent to all bishops, some copies of which are recorded in the patent rolls, ordered a search for heretical books by Purvey himself, by Hereford, Aston, and the late John Wyclif.<br>
<br>Purvey, according to Knighton, about this time preached heresy in Bristol. The next firm record is of Archbishop Arundel's investigation of Purvey on seven heretical views between 28 February and 5 March 1401; on 6 March Purvey recanted at Paul's Cross in London. The articles follow the main outline of Wyclif's teaching on the eucharist, sacerdotal absolution after confession, the preaching obligations of the clergy, the invalidity of wrongful excommunication, the ineffectuality of papal law, including that of clerical celibacy, unless founded expressly in scripture, and proclaim the priesthood of all believers. The number and rank of the clerics and lay persons assembled for the trial and for the recantation suggest that Purvey was viewed as an important suspect. On 11 August 1401 he was admitted as rector of West Hythe in Kent, close to the archbishop's residence at Saltwood Castle; the living was vacant by October 1403. Immediately preceding the list of the six errors abjured by Purvey in March 1401, <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span> lists eleven subdivided errors headed &#145;libelli Purvey Lollardi, collecti per reverendum magistrum fratrem Ricardum Lavynham Carmelitam&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span>, 399). Their proximity with the errors of 1401 may not be significant, since some undoubtedly heretical views concerning clerical temporalities and the pope are not replicated in the charges before Arundel.<br>
<br>Purvey's whereabouts, and his theological opinions, are then unknown for a further period of years; in 1407 William Thorpe stated that he &#145;schewith now himsilf to be neithir hoot ne coold&#146;  (Hudson, 363). Purvey, though not described as a local man, was named as one of the instigators of the Oldcastle rebellion in Derbyshire and Warwickshire. He was present at the confrontation between the king's forces and the rebels at St Giles's Field on 9 January 1414, evaded capture for a few days, but by 12 January had been arrested. He was held in Newgate prison until his death, apparently from natural causes, on 16 May of that year. By the time of his arrest Purvey was resident in London, and a list survives of the property that had been confiscated by the escheator from his residence following his imprisonment. It was valued at &pound;12 18<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. This list contains among other effects nineteen books; though the details given do not establish any as certainly Wycliffite in origin, they include biblical and patristic texts, canon law, and sermons.<br>
<br>Knighton in his <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> under 1382 described Purvey as the <i>quartus haeresiarcha</i> (&#145;fourth arch-heretic&#146;) following Wyclif, Hereford, and Aston, and claimed that Purvey lived in the same house as Wyclif (probably after the latter's retirement in 1381 to Lutterworth), and that he worked tirelessly to forward the master's views. Thomas Netter in his <span class="italic">Doctrinale</span>, written between 1421 and 1427, mentions Purvey a number of times. He quotes from a <span class="italic">De compendiis scripturarum, paternarum doctrinarum et canonum</span>, a copy of which he claims was taken from Purvey in prison; the book defended the right of all priests, laymen, and laywomen to preach, alleging support from canon law, Augustine, and Gregory. The second work, his <span class="italic">Libellus de oratione</span>, seems to have used the same method in regard to the length of prayers and the reason for them; this second is, however, slightly dubious, since it resembles in title and opinions a work elsewhere ascribed by Netter to William Taylor (correctly, to judge by parallel quotations given in the record of Taylor's 1423 trial before Archbishop Chichele). Netter's descriptions of Purvey as <i>doctor eximius</i> (&#145;excellent doctor&#146;), <i>glossator Wicleffi</i> (&#145;commentator on Wyclif&#146;), and <i>librarius Lollardorum</i> (&#145;librarian of the Lollards&#146;) encouraged extensive later speculation about Purvey's writing. Purvey is listed, along with William Swinderby, William Taylor, Sir John Oldcastle, and the Londoner John Claydon, as known to the Lollard suspect John Walcote, shepherd of Hasleton, Gloucestershire, when questioned in 1425.<br>
<br>Nothing that can firmly be attributed to Purvey survives. John Bale lists nineteen works in all, most of whose titles were extracted by Bale from the 1401 and Lavenham's listings of Purvey's views in the <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span> and from Netter. To this was added <span class="italic">Commentarius in Apocalypsim</span>, with the incipit of the work printed at Wittenberg in 1528 with a preface attributed to Luther; this was an abbreviated version of the <span class="italic">Opus arduum</span>, a work written in England between Christmas 1389 and Easter 1390 by an imprisoned Lollard, but there is no evidence before Bale to connect it with Purvey. In 1729 Daniel Waterland conjectured that Purvey was the writer of the so-called general prologue to the Wycliffite <span class="roman">Bible</span> and, through the contents of that, deduced that Purvey had a hand in the entire translation; John Lewis, who published Waterland's suggestion without indication of its conjectural nature, associated Purvey particularly with the later, more idiomatic version. This attribution has been repeated as established fact without question almost to the present day. To Purvey, following this, was also assigned a large number of other English Wycliffite texts, again without medieval supporting evidence.<br>
