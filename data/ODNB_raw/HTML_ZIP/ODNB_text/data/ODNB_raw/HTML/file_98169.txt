<span class="headword">Macleod,  Joseph Todd Gordon</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Adam Drinan]</span>  (1903&#150;1984), <span class="occ">poet and radio announcer</span>, was born at 19 Inglis Road, Ealing, Middlesex, on 24 April 1903, the only surviving child of Scottish parents, James Gordon Macleod, who became managing director of the Rio Tinto Trading Company, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Todd. He was educated at Rugby School, where he published poetry, book reviews, and essays in <span class="italic">The Rugbeian</span>, the literary supplement he edited at Rugby from 1919 to 1921 with the art critic Adrian Durham Stokes. One of his poems was included in <span class="italic">Public School Verse, 1921</span>. In 1922 he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a third-class degree in jurisprudence in 1925. At Oxford he belonged to the Mantichorean Society, founded by Graham Greene, with whom he formed a lifelong friendship. Macleod had poems and short stories accepted for the <span class="italic">Oxford Outlook</span>, edited for a time by Greene, and <span class="italic">The Cherwell</span>, which he edited in the autumn of 1924. <span class="italic">Oxford Poetry, 1924</span> included one of his poems, and three appeared in <span class="italic">Oxford Poetry, 1925</span>.<br>
<br>After graduating Macleod was admitted to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar in 1928, the year in which he married Kathleen (Kit) Macgregor (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Robert Davis MD of Uddingston. While studying for the bar he wrote <span class="italic">Beauty and the Beast</span>, which the American poetry editor Alfred Kreymborg termed a &#145;racy&#146; and &#145;rumbustious&#146; book of literary comment  (13 March 1928, NL Scot., Macleod papers), and which was accepted by Charles Prentice of Chatto and Windus in 1927. Also published by the Viking Press of New York in 1928, it was essentially Macleod's attempt to define the distinction between bad literature and good, with a modernist bias. His own first long poem, <span class="italic">The Ecliptic</span>, was accepted for publication by T. S. Eliot at Faber and Faber in 1930, at Ezra Pound's insistence. It is divided into twelve cantos, representing the twelve signs of the zodiac. Eliot included &#145;Leo, or, The Lion&#146; in the July 1930 issue of <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>, and Pound included &#145;Libra, or, The Scales&#146; in his private anthology <span class="italic">Profile</span> (1932). Basil Bunting regarded the poem as &#145;the best thing since <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poetry: a Magazine of Verse</span>, 40, 1932, 267&#150;8). Pound later referred to this section of the poem in <span class="italic">Canto CXIV</span> (1969), and corresponded with Macleod for many years. The poem was criticized for its opaque modernist style: although admiring the poem's versification, the American poet Delmore Schwartz thought that it &#145;ignores the common reader&#146;  (4 Dec 1934, NLScot., Macleod papers) and discussed the poem in <span class="italic">Mosaic: a Critical Quarterly</span> (spring 1935). Macleod's second poem, <span class="italic">Foray of Centaurs</span> (1931), was rejected by Herbert Read of Faber and Faber, and by all other publishing houses to whom it was submitted. Sections were published by <span class="italic">This Quarter</span> (Paris), <span class="italic">Poetry</span> (Chicago), and <span class="italic">The Criterion</span>, but it was never published in book form during his lifetime.<br>
<br>Macleod had abandoned the law to join the Cambridge Festival Theatre in 1929, and from 1929 to 1933 learned acting and theatre production under the tutelage of Terence Gray. In 1933 he succeeded Gray as theatre director and lessee at Cambridge, and held this post until 1935, when a shortage of finances forced him to leave. The theatre's highly stylized productions under both Macleod and Gray were regularly noted and praised by commentators who travelled from as far afield as Russia and the United States to watch them. Macleod wrote poems that steadily increased in their realism and clarity for the <span class="italic">Festival Theatre (New Lease) Programme</span> (1933&#150;5), which he edited; they anticipated the socialist realist poetry of the 1940s. He wrote a satirical novel <span class="italic">Overture to Cambridge</span> (1936), adapted from his play of the same title that shows the influence of H. G. Wells and Aldous Huxley. Macleod's friendships with Aldous and his brother Julian Huxley were important in the development of his early, scientific-based verse. After completing his novel he was attracted by politics, and in 1937 became secretary of Huntingdonshire divisional Labour Party and was briefly a prospective parliamentary candidate.<br>
<br>In 1938, after researching and recording a highly popular radio programme on Russian theatre history, Macleod was appointed a BBC announcer. During the war years he became a household name as a newsreader. His engagement with a mass audience influenced his poetic output, which now contained a strong simplicity while retaining his own distinct craftsmanship and intricacy of versification. Writing under the pseudonym Adam Drinan he published the poem sequences <span class="italic">The Cove</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">The Men of the Rocks</span> (1942), a verse-play <span class="italic">The Ghosts of the Strath</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">Women of the Happy Island</span> (1944) in rapid succession. At the suggestion of Naomi Mitchison, Macleod's <span class="italic">Women of the Happy Island</span> was published by William MacLellan (1915&#150;1996), the key publisher of the Scottish renaissance. Drinan was revered by W. S. Graham, Compton Mackenzie, Neil M. Gunn, William Montgomerie (1904&#150;1994), and Edwin Muir, who marvelled at his ability to render Gaelic rhythms and assonance in English, and his vivid descriptions of the Scottish landscape and its inhabitants. The American beat poet Kenneth Rexroth included both Macleod and Drinan in <span class="italic">New British Poets</span> (1949). Through the Drinan verse Macleod sought to develop a &#145;documentary&#146; style that focused on community and locality, particularly the people of the Scottish highlands and islands, while referring to such past oppressions as the clearances. Macleod's ancestors were from Skye, Drinan being one of its towns. <span class="italic">Women</span>, a sequence of forty-one soliloquies by speakers of the Hebridean Isle of Barra, was his most popular and well-received work, selling over 650 copies. At this time he also rose to prominence as a theatre historian under his own name with the publication of <span class="italic">The New Soviet Theatre</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Macleod had an uneasy relationship with the BBC authorities, who were suspicious of his socialist politics and Soviet sympathies. After being suspended from newsreading in 1943, he eventually resigned in November 1945 and settled in Edinburgh. His book <span class="italic">A Job at the B.B.C.</span> (1947) exposed his frustrations with the corporation's stifling, rigid conformity. He was managing director of the Scottish National Film Studios from 1946 to 1947, and was involved in theatre production. Vice-president of the Scottish-USSR society, he made a cultural visit to the Soviet Union in 1947. He revealed his identity as author on the cover of the final Drinan book, <span class="italic">Script from Norway</span> (1953), a 2700 word poem written in the form of a film script. This follows a group of English and Scottish film-makers in Norway to make a documentary about the nation and its people. It reflects his Scottish nationalism, drawing a parallel between Scotland and Norway as controlled by England and Sweden respectively. Christopher Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) formed a singular dislike for the work of Drinan, perhaps since it was by a Scot writing in English. The pseudonym also irritated him, so that when Macleod finally revealed his identity, MacDiarmid dismissed his Drinan work as backward-looking, and insisted that he should have stuck to the early high modernist poetry of <span class="italic">The Ecliptic</span>.<br>
<br>After Kit Macleod's death in December 1953 Macleod ceased to produce publishable poetry, largely because his themes became intensely autobiographical. A final book, <span class="italic">An Old Olive Tree</span> (1971), contained poems relating to his childhood, his family, poems about memory and the ageing process, and elegies to Greene and Stokes. By then he had married (on 10 December 1960) the sculptor Maria Teresa Foschini and long since settled into family life in Florence, where he died on 22 March 1984. His ashes were scattered at the Old Manse, his home in the Trossachs.<br>
