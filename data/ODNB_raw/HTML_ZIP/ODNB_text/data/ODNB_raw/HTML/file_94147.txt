</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Green,  Nigel McGown</span>  (1924&#150;1972), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Onderstepoort, near Pretoria, South Africa, on 15 October 1924, the son of Henry Hamilton Green DSc, a pioneering biochemist in the field of animal health who was working in South Africa at the time of his son's birth. In 1927 his father was appointed director of the Scottish Dairy Research Institute, and went on to become a research officer at the Veterinary Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture at New Haw. The family moved to Weybridge in Surrey and Nigel Green was educated at King's College School, Wimbledon, and at London University, where he studied chemical engineering. Enlisting in the Fleet Air Arm after turning eighteen, he served on torpedo bombers as a sub-lieutenant observer during the Second World War. Following demobilization he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art on a scholarship, and entered the theatre professionally.<br>
<br>Among Green's earliest stage appearances were a small role as a gangster in Maxwell Anderson's <span class="italic">Winterset</span> at the New Lindsey Theatre (1948), which won him a favourable personal notice from <span class="italic">The Times</span>; opposite Edith Evans in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span> at the Old Vic (1948) and John Gielgud in <span class="italic">King Lear</span> at the Stratford Festival (1950); in <span class="italic">The Foolish Gentlewoman</span> at the Duchess (1949), <span class="italic">Come Live with Me</span> at the Vaudeville (1951), and <span class="italic">Fires of Midsummer Eve</span> at the Embassy (1951). He married on 24 May 1952 Patricia Eileen Marmont (<i>b</i>. 1922), actress, daughter of Percy Marmont, actor.<br>
<br>When John Burrell's London production of <span class="italic">Mr Pickwick</span> transferred to Broadway in September 1952, Green was one of three original cast members to travel with the company to New York, where he again drew positive notices for his performance as Mr Jingle. While there he also made television appearances, including a leading role in a production of <span class="italic">Death Takes a Holiday</span> (1953). On his return to Britain he extended his developing career into the cinema.<br>
<br>Green's first screen credit was for the wartime drama <span class="italic">The Sea Shall Not Have Them</span> (1954) and among other bit parts was one in <span class="italic">Reach for the Sky</span> (1956). But in February 1956 he suffered a serious accident, fracturing his skull after slipping on ice. Hospitalized for weeks and suffering from paralysis and amnesia, he had a metal plate inserted in his head, which subsequently caused him severe headaches. After being discharged from hospital he took up golf as therapy. His first marriage ended in divorce, and he married, second, on 21 December 1956, Pamela Jacqueline Gordon-Tull (1937&#150;2003), actress, daughter of Reginald Gordon-Tull, architect. They had a son and a daughter, but they later separated.<br>
<br>Green returned to acting with a small but crucial role in another war film, Nicholas Ray's <span class="italic">Bitter Victory</span> (1957). The genre was to prove his forte. He worked in the theatre less often following his accident, though he had parts in <span class="italic">The Egg</span> at the Saville Theatre (1957) and in Agatha Christie's <span class="italic">Go Back for Murder</span> at the Duchess (1960). According to the actor&#150;director Peter Gill, &#145;there were rumours that he had offended Binkie Beaumont&#146;, the influential impresario  (Hall, 156). Certainly Green found more jobs on television than on the stage. His height (6 feet 4 inches) and imposing physique led him to appear most often in historical action series such as <span class="italic">The Adventures of Robin Hood</span> (1955&#150;60), <span class="italic">The Adventures of Sir Lancelot</span> (1956&#150;7), <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1958&#150;9), and in a recurring role in <span class="italic">William Tell</span> (1958&#150;9). In similar vein on the big screen he was Little John to Richard Greene's Robin Hood in Hammer's <span class="italic">Sword of Sherwood Forest</span> (1960). More notably, he played Hercules as a very human, fallible braggart in <span class="italic">Jason and the Argonauts</span> (1963). His part in another Ray Harryhausen fantasy, <span class="italic">Mysterious Island</span> (1961), was entirely deleted aside from one shot of the character's body lying face down in surf. Most of his other early film roles were routine, but he cut a striking figure as a Victorian police inspector in <span class="italic">Corridors of Blood</span> (1958) and as a prosecuting attorney in <span class="italic">The Durant Affair</span> (1962).<br>
<br>Cy Endfield, who had directed <span class="italic">Mysterious Island</span>, gave Green his defining role. In <span class="italic">Zulu</span> (1964), as Colour-Sergeant Frank Bourne&#151;though quite unlike the real-life last surviving veteran of the battle of Rorke's Drift&#151;Green created the archetypal British NCO: stolid and fastidious, but paternal and compassionate towards his men. Green was singled out for praise in virtually every review, and his film parts thereafter were more substantial, if never quite as memorable as Bourne. They included the double-dealing spymaster of <span class="italic">The Ipcress File</span> (1965); a rare heroic lead as Inspector Nayland Smith in <span class="italic">The Face of Fu Manchu</span> (1965); General Sir Garnet Wolseley in <span class="italic">Khartoum</span> (1966) and other military officers in <span class="italic">Tobruk</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">Play Dirty</span> (1969); sub-Bondian villains in <span class="italic">Deadlier than the Male</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">The Wrecking Crew</span> (1968); and another spy, code name &#145;The Whore&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Kremlin Letter</span> (1970). Regular television appearances included guest spots in several long-running series as well as a number of one-off dramas. The most intriguing of these found him once more playing a colour-sergeant opposite Michael Caine, in <span class="italic">The Other Man</span> (1964) by Giles Cooper: the longest single play screened up to that time by ITV, which was shot on videotape and subsequently wiped.<br>
<br>Green seems to have been a volatile personality. The <span class="italic">Zulu</span> cast and crew members recalled him as alternately warm and gentle or aggressive and argumentative, especially after drinking, when his temper was short. Occasionally during the South African location shoot Green went out of control. One fellow actor believed him to have been a former alcoholic; others have thought him prone to depression and insomnia. On 15 May 1972 Green's body was discovered at his home, 30 Sussex Square, Brighton, which he had named Bourne House after his <span class="italic">Zulu</span> character. He had died from a self-administered overdose of sleeping pills. Many of his friends and colleagues believed that he had committed suicide, but a verdict of misadventure was recorded. Green's final film, <span class="italic">Gawain and the Green Knight</span> (1973), in which he played the Green Knight, was released posthumously. He was once again a powerful presence in an inferior film; but the best of his screen portrayals, especially his emblematic role in <span class="italic">Zulu</span>, remain a potent reminder of a promising career abruptly curtailed.<br>
