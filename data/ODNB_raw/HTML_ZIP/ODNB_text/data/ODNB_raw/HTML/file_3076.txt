<span class="headword">Bowman,  Eddowes</span>  (1810&#150;1869), <span class="occ">teacher and classical scholar</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3079/', "John Eddowes Bowman the elder (1785&#150;1841)")</script>, and Elizabeth Eddowes (1788&#150;1859), his cousin, was born at Nantwich on 12 November 1810. He was educated chiefly at Hazelwood, near Birmingham, by Thomas Wright Hill, father of Rowland Hill; the latter was his teacher in mathematics. After leaving school he entered the Eagle foundry, Birmingham, with the intention of becoming an engineer. He became, about 1835, sub-manager of the Farteg ironworks, near Pontypool. Here his educational work among the local population revealed a natural aptitude for teaching. On the closing of the Farteg works in 1840, Bowman undertook further study, graduating MA at Glasgow University. He attended lectures at Berlin, acquiring several modern languages and mastering various branches of physical science. In 1842, while at Glasgow, he engaged in a pamphlet dispute with John Taylor, a Unitarian minister, as to whether the sabbath rested on divine authority.<br>
<br>In 1846 Bowman succeeded F. W. Newman to the classical chair in the Manchester New College, and he held that post until the removal of the college to Gordon Square, London, as a purely theological institution, in 1853. He strongly opposed the move and remained in Manchester where, although he had private means, he continued to be an active teacher. He took a particular interest in the education of girls. As the natural sciences came to be his major interest, he delivered several courses of lectures, at the Manchester Royal Institution and elsewhere, on optics and acoustics. For the study of astronomy he built for himself an excellent observatory; he was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1864. From 1865, when the Owens scholarship was founded in connection with the Unitarian Home Missionary Board, he was one of the examiners. He was a man of undemonstrative disposition, of wise kindness, and of cultural philanthropy. His chief publication was a learned monograph <span class="italic">On the Roman Governors of Syria at the Time of the Birth of Christ</span> (1855), reprinted from the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span> (October 1855), a magazine to which he was a frequent contributor. He died, unmarried, at Victoria Park, Manchester, on 10 July 1869.<br>
