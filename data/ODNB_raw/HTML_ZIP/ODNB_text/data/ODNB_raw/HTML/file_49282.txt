<span class="headword">Gibbins family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1770&#150;1919), <span class="occ">manufacturers and bankers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_49280"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Gibbins senior</span>  (1756&#150;1811), who became a button maker in Birmingham. As businessmen, Quakers were required to act with scrupulous honesty in all their business dealings and Joseph Gibbins was said to have given up his business in the 1790s when competition in the trade began to involve the selling of inferior shoddy goods to the public, a practice strictly forbidden within the Society of Friends. In 1797, reputedly with the financial help of Matthew Boulton, he went into business at the Rose Copper Works at Swansea, where he was a supplier to Boulton's Birmingham minting business. Gibbins appears to have first been manager and then treasurer of the company and, at his death in 1811, he owned 150 shares in the firm as well as shares in other metallurgical concerns.<br>
<br>The Rose Copper Works had offices at both Swansea and Birmingham and from here Gibbins expanded his business interests to the banking sector. In 1804, in partnership with Samuel Galton and his son Samuel Tertius Galton, he set up a bank in Birmingham and in 1809 invested in the Swansea bank of Gibbins and Eaton. Joseph Gibbins and his wife, Martha (1758&#150;1827), had numerous children. Among this large family were Joseph; Thomas, an industrialist who had visited Brazil in the early 1820s; Brueton, partner of Joseph Gibbins junior in the Birmingham Banking Company, founded in 1829; George; William; Martha; Margaret; and Mary. Of those members of the family possessing commercial interests, it is <a name="cosubject_49282"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Gibbins junior</span>  (1787&#150;1870) who is best-known as a Quaker banker in the west midlands.<br>
<br>In 1811 Joseph Gibbins succeeded to his father's share in the Swansea bank of Gibbins and Eaton, and by 1818 he had also acquired Joseph senior's share in the Birmingham bank of Gibbins, Smith, and Goode. In 1836 the House of Commons established the secret committee on joint stock banks and Joseph Gibbins junior was called by the committee as a witness. From his evidence it is clear that Gibbins had been active in bank promotion in the 1820s and early 1830s. In the course of his evidence he stated that he was the originator of the Birmingham Banking Company, founded in 1829; the Gloucester Banking Company, founded in 1831; and, in part, of the Hampshire Banking Company, founded in 1834. He also held a small interest in several other companies.<br>
<br>Evidence of the direct financing of industry by banks in the early phases of Britain's industrialization is difficult to establish. However, the business activities of the younger Joseph Gibbins offer an example of the practice, commonly adopted by entrepreneurs, of borrowing from banks in which they held a partnership in order to finance their manufacturing interests. In 1813 Joseph purchased a chemical works at Melin Crythan in south Wales, a firm in which he was actively involved for the next five years. By 1826 the Melin Crythan works was in receipt of finance from the Banbury bank of Gillett and Tawney. In an age when the ability to raise borrowed capital relied heavily upon local credit networks the granting of direct finance to a firm at such a geographical distance appears unusual at first sight. However, a closer examination reveals the business connection between south Wales and Banbury to have been yet another link in the impressive religious and kinship network which was so much a part of the Quaker business world.<br>
<br>In August 1821 Martha [<a name="cosubject_49283"></a><span class="headword">Martha Gillett</span>  (1798&#150;1882)<span class="occ"></span>], a sister of the younger Joseph Gibbins, married <a name="cosubject_65047"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Ashby Gillett</span>  (1795&#150;1853), Quaker shag and shalloon manufacturer of Neithrop, Banbury. Her husband, born on 4 September 1795, was the eldest son of William Gillett (1767&#150;1849), Quaker farmer, textile manufacturer, and semi-banker, of Upper Brailes, near Shipston-on-Stour. The couple had a daughter and four sons, including Charles Gillett (1830&#150;1895). On her marriage Martha received a settlement which allowed Joseph Ashby Gillett to purchase a partnership in Whiteheads Bank at Shipston-on-Stour. The settlement allowed him to borrow &pound;5000 without interest. A part of this sum represented money to which his bride would become entitled on her mother's death. The trustees of this settlement were two of Martha's brothers, Joseph and Brueton Gibbins, and their cousin, Jeffery Bevington Lowe of Eatington, who had married Margaret Whitehead and was a partner in Whiteheads Bank.<br>
<br>By 1822 Gillett's brother-in-law, Joseph Gibbins, had provided &pound;6000 of capital towards the purchase of the Banbury New Bank (established 1784) from R. and C. Tawney. Although the brothers-in-law were co-partners in the bank, Joseph Gibbins continued to concentrate on his other banking interests, leaving Gillett to manage the Banbury bank. From this point, until its amalgamation with Barclays Bank Ltd in 1919, the Banbury bank always retained at least one Gillett as a partner and became known colloquially as Gilletts Bank. Joseph Ashby Gillett died in 1853, but his wife, Martha, survived him, and died on 27 May 1882 at 2 West Street, Banbury.<br>
<br>The story of the Banbury bank might have been different, since the bank was forced to close its doors for several weeks during the financial crisis of 1825&#150;6. Joseph Gibbins was, at least in part, responsible for the bank's vulnerability at this time. Gibbins had adopted the practice of discounting Birmingham and Swansea bills using the funds of the Banbury bank to do so. This practice was risky, since it was tantamount to rediscounting, and indeed brought down both the Birmingham and the Swansea banks in 1825 and also caused temporary suspension at Banbury. As a result of his actions Joseph Gibbins was compelled to retire as a partner in the Banbury bank when the firm underwent reconstruction after the crisis. Indeed, from the records of the Birmingham bank of Gibbins, Smith, and Goode, it appears that Gibbins was perhaps less cautious in his business activities than his Quaker religion advised. The bank is said to have had a note circulation which was in excess of its five rival banks put together and, according to the balance sheet at bankruptcy, even after the run on the bank in 1825 which led to its closure, over &pound;52,000 remained in outstanding notes.<br>
<br>The financial fortunes of Joseph Gibbins had revived sufficiently by the late 1840s to allow him to recompense the Banbury bank for his earlier failing. The bank again faced serious financial difficulties during the crisis of 1847&#150;8. On this occasion, however, it was Joseph Gibbins who came to the rescue by depositing a special loan of &pound;4285 with the bank. In 1866 Joseph again gave financial assistance to the Banbury branch of the family when he lent his nephew Charles Gillett &pound;4000 to increase his capital in the Banbury bank where Charles was now a partner. Two years later Charles received a further &pound;2000 as a gift from his uncle plus a legacy of nearly &pound;1000 on Joseph's death on 24 March 1870 at Houndshill, near Stratford upon Avon.<br>
<br>The religious and kinship links by marriage between the Gillett and Gibbins families were further reinforced by the early joint business activities of the younger Joseph Gibbins and Joseph Ashby Gillett. This banking partnership between the brothers-in-law is illustrative of the close kinship network which typified the Quaker business world of the day. From this beginning Joseph Ashby Gillett went on to forge a successful career in the banking sector and he is undoubtedly an outstanding figure in the history of Gilletts Bank. While Joseph Gibbins held interests in manufacturing, he was most notable for his involvement in banking and in particular bank promotion. Indeed, Joseph Gibbins played a significant role in the establishment and growth of banking not only in Birmingham but also in south Wales.<br>
