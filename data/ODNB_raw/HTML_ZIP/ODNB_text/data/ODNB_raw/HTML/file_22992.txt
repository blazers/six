<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Robert</span>, fifth earl of Sussex  (1573&#150;1629), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was born on 12 June 1573, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22982/', "Henry Radcliffe, fourth earl of Sussex (1533&#150;1593)")</script>, and his wife, Honor (<i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of Anthony Pound of Farlington, Hampshire. His birthplace is unknown, though it may well have been Hampshire, where his father was lord lieutenant and governor of Portsmouth. The details of his education are also unknown. His family had Cambridge connections&#151;his aunt, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66355/', "Frances Radcliffe (n&#233;e Sidney), countess of Sussex")</script>, had founded Sidney Sussex College, and he later sent one of his sons to Trinity College. There is, however, no evidence that he attended the university. From 1583 to 1593 Radcliffe bore the courtesy title Lord Fitzwalter.<br>
<br>In or before 1592 Fitzwalter married Bridget (<i>bap</i>. 1575, <i>d</i>. 1623), the eldest daughter of Sir Charles Morison of Cassiobury, Hertfordshire. Their two sons and two daughters all died before both of them. The couple gained a reputation as literary patrons in the 1590s. In 1592 Robert Greene dedicated to Lord Fitzwalter Thomas Lodge's <span class="italic">Euphues Shadow</span> and to his wife <span class="italic">Philomela</span>, which he subtitled <span class="italic">The Lady Fitzwater's Nightingale</span>. She also received the dedication of a music-book, <span class="italic">The New Book of Tabliture</span> (1596). Henry Lok addressed a sonnet to the earl of Sussex (as he was by then) in <span class="italic">Sundry Christian Passions</span> (1597) and Emanuel Ford dedicated his romance <span class="italic">Parismus</span> to him the following year.<br>
<br>Radcliffe succeeded his father on 14 December 1593 and quickly assumed a modest role at court despite a straitened income&#151;in addition to large private debts, he owed &pound;12,000 to the crown. In August 1594 Queen Elizabeth sent him to Scotland as her ambassador for the baptism of Prince Henry. But peaceful pursuits bored him, and in 1595 he asked the queen's permission to serve in the imperial army against the Turks. In the end, however, a less speculative project emerged and in 1596 he took command of a regiment in the earl of Essex's assault on Cadiz. Sussex's place in Essex's circle was confirmed when the general knighted him in the field on 27 June 1596. Sussex served as earl marshal from October to December 1597, and in 1599 he received the Garter. The same year, in August, Elizabeth named him colonel-general of foot, leading a London-based army charged with repelling an expected Spanish invasion. The attack never materialized, however, and Sussex's army remained a paper one. In 1601 his close relations with Essex endangered him; Essex claimed that Sussex was committed to his rebellion, and the privy council confined him in London at Sir John Stanhope's house. But Essex's claim was probably no more than wishful thinking, for no hard evidence emerged against Sussex and he was restored to favour by his re-appointment as earl marshal later the same year.<br>
<br>James I's accession offered Sussex new scope for action. In August 1603 James appointed him lord lieutenant of Essex, a position he filled conscientiously until his death. But a lieutenancy offered no relief from his increasingly desperate financial plight&#151;by 1601 he had sold lands worth &pound;20,000, and he continued to sell his patrimony in succeeding years. In 1614 Lionel Cranfield bought his manor of Shering, Essex, and in 1621 Sussex sold New Hall, his principal seat, the impressive pile enlarged by his uncle the third earl, to Buckingham for &pound;21,000. King James occasionally offered Sussex some help: remitting debts to the crown, a grant of lands worth 100 marks per year in 1603, and a &pound;400 pension in 1609, but these did nothing to halt Sussex's financial decline. His problems were probably exacerbated by the breakdown of his marriage. By 1602 he was keeping as his mistress one of his wife's former gentlewomen, Sylvester Morgan. His wife lived separately on &pound;1700 a year charged on his estate. The illicit relationship scandalized some contemporaries; the diarist John Manningham recorded how the earl called his mistress his &#145;countess&#146;, even though his wife lived, and dressed her in her velvet gown. He recorded the comment of a friend that, &#145;I would be loath to come after him [the earl] to a wench for feare of the pox&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Manningham</span>, 97&#150;8). George Chapman in 1609 felt it appropriate to include a verse dedicated to Sussex, &#145;with dutie, alwaies profest to his most Honor'd Countesse&#146; in his translation of the <span class="roman">Iliad</span>, hinting perhaps at a rapprochement between the earl and his wife, but if any such existed it was soon over  (G. Chapman, <span class="italic">Homer Prince of Poets</span>, 1609, sig. EC2<i>v</i>). In September the following year Jane, ostensibly the daughter of Edward Shute but in fact Sussex's, was baptized at St Clement Danes. Sussex lived with her mother, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1627), daughter of Hercules Meautys, Shute's wife and in due course widow, for many years. Their relationship came before the privy council in 1618, when the earl obstructed their attempt to summon his mistress. The countess of Sussex died in 1623 and Sussex married Frances within days of her burial on 11 December&#151;or even sooner. According to John Chamberlain, Sussex forestalled his wife's deathbed efforts to prevent the marriage taking place by wedding Frances the very day after the countess died, before the pursuivants could deliver a warrant to stop it. Frances died on 18 November 1627, having borne no legitimate children with Sussex.<br>
<br>In 1625 Sussex played a significant part in the defence of Essex from an expected French attack. He organized preparations, strengthening local fortifications and leading 3000 militiamen to Harwich. Although Sussex seems to have performed this task well, Charles I alienated him by sending the earl of Warwick to Harwich with a commission appointing him joint lord lieutenant of the county. Sussex took the slight badly, claiming that his reputation was &#145;a-bleeding&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1625&#150;6</i>, 150). Charles then restored him to sole command&#151;thereby alienating Warwick. Sussex later refused Warwick's offer of &pound;2000 for his lieutenancy. Although he bore the orb at Charles I's coronation and retained his lieutenancy, Sussex never occupied a very important place in the new reign. He died at his house in Clerkenwell, London, on 22 September 1629, and was buried at St Andrew's Church, Boreham, Essex, near his former home, New Hall, on 23 October. He was succeeded as sixth earl by his cousin, Edward Radcliffe. He devised the ancient Radcliffe estate of Attleborough in Norfolk to his illegitimate daughter Jane and her husband.<br>
