<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lister,  Joseph Jackson</span>  (1786&#150;1869), <span class="occ">wine merchant and microscopist</span>, was born on 11 January 1786 in Lothbury, City of London, the only son of John Lister, a wine merchant, and his wife, Mary Jackson (<i>d</i>. 1808). His parents were members of the Society of Friends; his father's family, originally from Yorkshire, had settled in London, and both parents were part of the close-knit Quaker business community of the City. Mary Lister's father, Stephen Jackson, was a wine merchant and on their marriage John Lister left his trade as a watchmaker and took over his father-in-law's business in Lothbury. The Listers had two daughters before their son, Joseph Jackson, was born after a gap of seventeen years. His birth was greeted with rejoicing, and he was given a name commemorating his two grandfathers. He was a gifted child, and was educated from 1792 to 1796 at a Friends' school in Hitchin, and then for a year at Rochester School. At the age of twelve in 1798, he was sent as a boarder to one of the best private schools open to members of the Society of Friends, run by Thomas Thompson at Little Compton in Dorset. The school encouraged general reading and the pupils were allowed some discretion in the employment of their time. That was good for Lister, who had great mental curiosity and was well able to follow his own paths to knowledge. He was said to be the only boy at the school who owned a telescope.<br>
<br>At the age of fourteen Lister left school to work in the family wine business, living above the premises in Lothbury with his parents until the death of his mother in 1808. His father then moved to Stoke Newington, where he lived with his unmarried daughter, taking an annuity out of the business. Joseph Jackson Lister was now a wine merchant, and about 1812 he transferred to a new address nearby at 5 Tokenhouse Yard, where, on 14 July 1818, he brought Isabella Harris (<i>c</i>.1795&#150;1864), a schoolteacher, as his bride. Four years later they moved to Stoke Newington, and then in 1826 Lister bought Upton House, West Ham, where he lived for the rest of his life. The property was large enough to provide space for a growing family of three daughters and four sons, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34553/', "Joseph Lister")</script> became Baron Lister of Lyme Regis, the famous surgeon, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34552/', "Arthur Lister")</script> became a botanist. These moves were made possible by the addition to the staff of Lister's nephew, Richard Low Beck, who became a resident partner.<br>
<br>Alongside the family man with a successful business and an energetic younger associate, was the meticulous inventor, who, in his spare time, and for no remuneration, carried out the research in the design of lenses that transformed the microscope into the most ubiquitous and practically useful of all scientific instruments. The development and use of the microscope, from its invention in 1608 until the early years of the nineteenth century, were hampered by the quality of glass available for the lenses, and by aberrations of the image. Chromatic aberration was the name given to the coloured edge to the image caused by unequal refraction of light rays. This was corrected for the telescope by John Dollond in 1758, and for the microscope by the Amsterdam instrument maker, Harmanus van Deijl, who published in 1807. The other serious source of aberration resulted from the spherical curvature of the lenses, which produced a blurred image, and this problem was still unsolved in the early 1800s. Lister described how, in his thirty-eighth year, he became involved in the design of microscope lenses. about 1824 he saw at William Tulley's, the instrument maker, an achromatic object glass of two convex lenses of plate glass sandwiching a concave lens of flint glass. By a tracing made from a camera lucida with his own microscope he showed Tulley that his objective was clumsy. Lister's suggestions resulted in &#145;&#147;Tulley's 9/10&#148; which became <i>the</i> microscopic object-glass of the time&#146;  (J. Lister, 141).<br>
<br>Further researches resulted in Lister's important discovery announced in the paper &#145;On the improvement of compound microscopes&#146; read before the Royal Society on 21 January 1830. There he stated that an achromatic combination of a negative flint glass lens with a positive crown glass lens has two aplanatic focal points. The spherical aberration is overcorrected for all points between these foci, and is undercorrected for all points outside. So if a doublet objective is made that is composed of two sets of achromatic lens combinations, spherical aberration can be avoided if the object to be viewed is at the shorter aplanatic focus of the first lens pair, which then passes the rays on to the longer aplanatic focus of the second pair. Lister's design of the first aberration corrected object glass for the microscope thus brought to an end the trial and error efforts of instrument makers and scientists alike by establishing a scientific principle for the making of microscope objectives. These could now be free of both achromatic and spherical aberration, and also of the effect known as coma, which caused a spot of light to appear elongated and fuzzy, like a comet. The design of low-power objectives for the optical microscope even at the end of the twentieth century was based on Lister's discovery. Its importance was recognized by the election of Lister to fellowship of the Royal Society in February 1832.<br>
<br>Having made a highly significant contribution to microscope design Lister was eager to continue his research but found that Tulley could not spare the time to make lenses to his specification. Therefore Lister began, in late 1830, to do his own grinding and polishing. As he explained:<blockquote>Without having ever before cut brass or ground more than a single surface of a piece of glass, I managed to make the tools and to manufacture a combination of three double object-glasses, without spoiling a lens or altering a curve. (J. Lister, 140)</blockquote>The optical instrument makers did not immediately adopt Lister's designs, since there is always inertia in economic production. He had hoped that his improvements would be followed up by the opticians, but the object glasses produced by the makers continued to be of the usual simple design of two or three plano-convex compound lenses until the beginning of 1837. It was then that Andrew Ross, a leading maker, made a one-eighth inch objective to Lister's design, and in 1840 James Smith constructed quarter inch objectives that became popular with microscopists. Over the next four decades, with Lister's designs commercially available, the microscope became a serious scientific instrument in many fields, notably in medicine and public health, and it reached its limit of resolution in the 1880s.<br>
<br>James Smith's association with Lister was a long and important one. In 1826 he made a new form of microscope stand to Lister's design, intended to provide the greater stability demanded by the increased magnification that could be achieved. This innovation was also gradually adopted by microscopists. Richard Beck, the son of Lister's nephew and partner, Richard Low Beck, was apprenticed to Smith and went into partnership with him in 1847. Richard Beck was joined in the firm by his brother Joseph in 1851 and the latter was made a partner in 1857. The firm of R. and J. Beck was established on Smith's retirement in 1865. The optical factory of the firm was opened at Holloway in 1853, appropriately named the Lister Works, and it clearly followed the Quaker tradition. The microscopist Thomas Hudson recorded in his diary a visit to the works in May 1854, finding it &#145;a model optical manufactory having a Steam Engine working Lathes &amp;c this is a most complete establishment having a Library and Reading and Refreshment Room&#146;  (Turner, &#145;Frederick Thomas Hudson's microscopical diary&#146;, 198).<br>
<br>Lister was not only a designer, but also throughout his life a skilled microscopist. He published in 1827 a paper with Thomas Hodgkin that described for the first time the true form and most accurate measure of the diameter of red blood cells. His observations of zoophytes and ascidians were reported to the Royal Society in 1834. He did considerable research into the resolving power of the human eye and of the microscope, anticipating some of the findings of Abbe and Helmholtz, but did not publish the paper, which existed ready for press, during his lifetime. Lister's manuscripts include designs and draft papers, and these, together with a case of tools, lenses, and microscope objectives made by Joseph Jackson Lister were presented to the Royal Microscopical Society on 15 May 1912 by the executors of Lord Lister.<br>
<br>Lister's greatest work was his paper on the theory of the microscopic image drafted during 1842&#150;3, although it was not published in his lifetime; it represented over ten years' work. On receiving Lord Lister's bequest, the council of the Royal Microscopical Society asked Alexander Eugen Conrady, a lens designer who became, in 1917, the first professor of optical design at Imperial College, London, to examine the Lister archive. He transcribed (not always accurately) for publication in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society</span>, 33 (1913), 27&#150;55, Lister's memorandum to Andrew Ross dated 1837, some correspondence, and the draft paper &#145;On the limit to defining-power, in vision with the unassisted eye, the telescope, and the microscope&#146;, dated 1842&#150;3; it occupies pp. 34&#150;55. Conrady commented that the paper is the first proof that J. J. Lister knew in 1832 that the resolving-power of microscope objectives grows not with the angle itself, as was thought for many years after that date, but with the chord of an angle, later called numerical aperture  (Conrady, 52). The paper is evidence that Lister, having provided the original impetus to developing the scientific microscope, derived the law of image formation three decades before Ernest Abbe of Jena University. The development of the instrument would have been even more rapid had he published this paper. It also seems curious that his son, Lord Lister, when writing his father's obituary in 1869, did not see fit to publish it, for he was in possession of the archive.<br>
<br>Lister lived during the golden age of the light microscope, and was admired by many of its leading users. He was one of the group of microscopists who met in September 1839 and agreed to form a society to promote microscopical investigation, the Microscopical Society of London, later to receive a royal charter. John Quekett, the first secretary of the society, dedicated to Lister his best-selling <span class="italic">Practical Treatise on the Use of the Microscope</span> (1848), with the words: &#145;To Joseph Jackson Lister Esq. FRS, to whose labours in perfecting the achromatic compound microscope science in England is so deeply indebted&#146;. Lister died at his home, Upton House, on 24 October 1869, of old age and pneumonia.<br>
