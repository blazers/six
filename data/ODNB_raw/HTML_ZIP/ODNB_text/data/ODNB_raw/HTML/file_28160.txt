<span class="headword">Vaux,  Thomas</span>, second Baron Vaux  (1509&#150;1556), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 25 April 1509, one of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28162/', "Nicholas Vaux, first Baron Vaux of Harrowden (c.1460&#150;1523)")</script>, courtier and soldier, and his second wife, Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1489, <i>d</i>. in or before 1523), daughter of Sir Thomas Green of Boughton and Green's Norton, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Jane. Just after his fourteenth birthday in 1523, Vaux married Elizabeth (1504&times;9&#150;1556), daughter of Sir Thomas Cheyne of Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire, and of Thenford and Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir William Parr. They had two sons and two daughters. One of their sons was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28165/', "William Vaux, third Baron Vaux of Harrowden (1535&#150;1595)")</script>. Vaux is said to have been educated at Cambridge University, but there is no surviving evidence for this.<br>
<br>In July 1527 Vaux was a member of Cardinal Wolsey's retinue on his embassy to France, where he negotiated with Fran&ccedil;ois I at Amiens. He first sat in parliament in 1529, and attended King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn on their visit to Fran&ccedil;ois I at Calais in September 1532, taking twelve retainers with him. On 18 April of that year a man of his name wrote to the duke of Norfolk from Ampthill, revealing his unhappiness with his role in relation to the king's treatment of Katherine of Aragon  (BL, Cotton MS Otho C.x, fol. 177), but this was probably not Lord Vaux. On 30 May 1533 Vaux was created a knight of the Bath for the coronation of Anne Boleyn on the next day. In March 1535 he signed a document acknowledging the payment to him of &pound;280 by Roger Chomley for the manor of Newington Luces, Kent; the other witnesses were Sir Thomas Wyatt and Sir Thomas Poynings.<br>
<br>Vaux's only public office seems to have been that of governor of Jersey which he held from January to August 1536: he sold the office on to Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, for &pound;150. It seems likely that at about this time he withdrew from the court and retired to his Northamptonshire estates, probably because his religious views were opposed to the growing influence of protestantism. Except for one day in November 1547, he did not attend parliament between 1534 and 1554. With other noblemen he attended the third of a series of disputations on questions appointed by the royal visitors at Cambridge University on 24&#150;5 June 1549, and was part of Queen Mary's train at her coronation.<br>
<br>Vaux is usually associated with the courtly poets Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, earl of Surrey. Vaux's poems are all original compositions rather than translations or imitations. They are mainly concerned with the trials of love and strike moralizing, sententious, and occasionally religious notes. On a few occasions Vaux produces an unexpected metrical effect and a fresh or intimate tone, but his meaning is sometimes obscure. In <span class="italic">The Arte of English Poesie</span> (1589), George Puttenham included Vaux among the &#145;new company of courtly makers&#146; who sprang up during the reign of King Henry VIII. Beginning the long confusion between father and son by calling him Nicholas Vaux, Puttenham described him as &#145;a man of much facillitie in vulgar makings&#146;, adding that &#145;his commendation lyeth chiefly in the facillitie of his meetre, and the aptnesse of his descriptions such as he taketh upon him to make, namely in sundry of his Songs, wherein he sheweth the counterfait action very lively &amp; pleasantly&#146;  (Puttenham, 60, 62). Elsewhere, again getting his first name wrong, Puttenham describes Vaux as &#145;a noble gentleman, and much delighted in vulgar making, &amp; a man otherwise of no great learning but having herein a marvelous facillitie&#146;  (ibid., 239).<br>
<br>The canon of Vaux's surviving poetry is small. Describing the figure of &#145;<i>Pragamatographia</i>. or the Counterfait action&#146;, Puttenham quoted twenty-two lines of a poem which he attributed to Vaux. The complete poem of fifty-six lines, with a few textual changes, was printed, without attribution, under the title &#145;Thassault of Cupide upon the Fort where the Lovers Hart Lay Wounded and how he was Taken&#146; in Richard Tottel's <span class="italic">Songes and Sonnetes</span> (1557), a year after Vaux's death. The poem (no. 211 in <span class="italic">Tottel's Miscellany</span>) remained popular during the rest of the century: it was adapted and printed by John Awdely (<i>c</i>.1560), registered for publication as a ballad in 1565&#150;6, adapted again in <span class="italic">A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions</span> (1578), where it is described as &#145;To the tune, when Cupid scaled first the Fort&#146;, and copied in a manuscript miscellany (BL, Harley MS 6910) in the mid-1590s.<br>
<br>The following poem in Tottel's miscellany (no. 212 in Rollins's edition), headed &#145;The Aged Lover Renounceth Love&#146; and beginning &#145;I Lothe that I did love&#146;, is again unattributed, but ascribed to Vaux in two contemporary manuscript miscellanies (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 48 and BL, Harley MS 1703); in the second of these it is said to have been written during the reign of Queen Mary. It was registered as a ballad for publication in 1563&#150;4, and perhaps again in 1579; in his <span class="italic">Posies</span> of 1575, George Gascoigne referred to the poem's first line as written by Vaux, and &#145;thought by some to be made upon his death bed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Posies</span>, sig. &para; &para; iii<i>r</i>). The poem's first line also supplies the name of a tune for a poem in <span class="italic">A Gorgeous Gallery</span>: two more or less contemporary settings of the tune are known. It is a corrupt version of three stanzas (1, 3, and 8) of this poem which the gravedigger sings in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (<span class="smallcap">V</span>.i).<br>
<br>Two other poems in Tottel's miscellany have been attributed to Vaux in two manuscripts once owned by the Harington family. BL, Add. MS 28635, and the collection of poems, now at Arundel Castle, which is known as the Arundel Harington manuscript both have copies of the sonnet entitled &#145;The Frailtie and Hurtfulnes of Beautie&#146; which begins &#145;Brittle beautie, that nature made so fraile&#146; and of the alliterative epigram &#145;Against an Unstedfast Woman&#146; (respectively, nos. 9 and 217 in Rollins's edition of Tottel and nos. 298 and 299 in the edition of the <span class="italic">Arundel Harington Manuscript</span> by R. Hughey). Puttenham printed his own imitation of the first of these &#145;made to daunt the insolence of a beautifull woman&#146;  (Puttenham, 123). Two further poems in the Arundel Harington manuscript can be associated with Vaux. One, a short poem beginning &#145;Syns by examples daylye we are taught&#146; (no. 173 in Hughey's edition), is unique to the manuscript and attributed to him in it. The second, beginning &#145;When I looke back and in my self behold&#146; (no. 22 in Hughey's edition), is one of fifteen poems printed above Vaux's name in the collection <span class="italic">The Paradise of Dainty Devices</span> (1576), where it has the title &#145;Of the Instabilitie of Youth&#146; (no. 17). In addition to being copied in the Harington family collection, BL, Add. MS 28635, it is also found in two late sixteenth-century manuscript miscellanies (BL, Add. MSS 26737 and 30076): in the second of these it appears to be used as a song, and music for it survives, perhaps by Robert Parsons, in the Bodleian Library (MS mus. sch. e. 423). A shorter version of the poem, which seems to be independent of these sources, was printed in the Harington family collection <span class="italic">Nugae antiquae</span> in 1769 with the heading &#145;SONNET <i>wrote in the</i> <i>Tower</i>, 1554&#146;, with the implication that the poem was by John Harington the elder. The other poems attributed to Vaux in <span class="italic">The Paradise</span> are nos. 8 (&#145;In his Extreame Sycknesse&#146;), 16, 37 (another version is in <span class="italic">A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions</span> of 1578), 48, 71 (&#145;How can the tree but wast&#146;, for which musical settings survive), 80&#150;81, 87&#150;92, and 113 in Rollins's edition: nos. 48 and 88 are probably by William Hunnis.<br>
<br>In March 1556 Vaux was recorded as living at Arnold, Nottinghamshire; the date of his death is not known, but he was buried in October of that year. His wife died on 20 November, and it is likely that both were victims of the plague. He was succeeded by his son William.<br>
<br>There are two different drawings of Vaux by Hans Holbein the younger in the Royal Collection and one of his wife: they probably date from before 1536 and were executed in preparation for a pair of portraits of the couple. No painted versions are known of the portrait of Lord Vaux, but early painted versions of the picture of Lady Vaux are at Hampton Court and Prague, and probably derive from a lost original by Holbein.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28160"></a><span class="headword">Edward Vaux</span>, fourth Baron Vaux of Harrowden  (1588&#150;1661)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 13 September 1588, the son of George Vaux (1564&#150;1594) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>fl</i>. 1585&#150;1625), daughter of John Roper, first Baron Teynham, and his wife, Elizabeth. Edward was the grandson of William Vaux, the third baron, and the great-grandson of Thomas Vaux, the second baron, inheriting a strong devotion to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>Vaux was a ward of Queen Elizabeth I, but his mother bought back the wardship in or before Hilary term 1598, and he was brought up by his mother and her sisters-in-law, Anne Vaux and Eleanor, the wife of Edward Brooksby. He was educated with other boys by private tutors at Harrowden. From 1598 his mother sheltered the Jesuit priest John Gerard there, and mother and son were both suspected of being implicated in the Gunpowder Plot. Vaux travelled to Italy with Sir Oliver Manners in 1609&#150;11, and was committed to the Fleet on his return for refusing to take the oath of allegiance. Sentenced to perpetual imprisonment and the loss of all his lands, he was pardoned and transferred to the custody of the dean of Westminster, George Montaigne, or Mountain, in October 1612, had his forfeited lands restored, and was released on the payment of sureties of &pound;1500 in 1614&#150;15. He attended parliament, served as a colonel of an English regiment in the Spanish service in Flanders in 1622&#150;4, and, after a search of his house at Boughton for arms, was again committed to the Fleet for a short period in November 1625. During the civil war, in which he seems not to have taken an active part, his recusancy resulted in the confiscation of his estates.<br>
<br>In 1632, within five weeks of her husband's death, Vaux married Elizabeth (1586&#150;1658), widow of William Knollys, first earl of Banbury, the daughter of Thomas Howard, first earl of Suffolk, and his second wife, Catherine. Vaux had probably lived with her while her husband was alive, and the couple had two sons, Edward (1627&#150;<i>c</i>.1645) and Nicholas (<i>b</i>. 1631), who bore the surname Vaux. Their paternity was in fact generally regarded as doubtful, and when Vaux died, on 8 September 1661, and was buried in Dorking church, he was found to have added to the uncertainty, for in his will he left bequests of &pound;10 apiece to his presumed son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15757/', "Nicholas Knollys")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15760/', "Knollys, William, first earl of Banbury")</script>], who took the title of third earl of Banbury, and his brother Henry Vaux (<i>c</i>.1591&#150;1663), who succeeded as fifth Baron Vaux of Harrowden. But perhaps in an effort to avoid committing himself on the paternity of the Knollys boys Vaux left the bulk of his estate to Augustin Belson, a close friend and fellow recusant. Henry Vaux died unmarried and without children. The title then fell into abeyance until it was revived on 12 March 1838 by George Charles Mostyn of Kiddington (1804&#150;1883) who claimed it through his mother and the families of Vaux, Simeon, and Butler. The House of Lords decided in favour of Mostyn's claim to the title in preference to that of Edward Bourchier Hartopp; a third coheir, Robert Henry Herbert, twelfth earl of Pembroke, did not pursue his claim. Mostyn and Hartopp both traced their descent to daughters (Mary and Catharine, respectively) of George Vaux, the son of William Vaux, the third baron.<br>
