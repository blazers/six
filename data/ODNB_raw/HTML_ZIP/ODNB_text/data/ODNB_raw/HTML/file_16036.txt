<span class="headword">Langston,  John</span>  (1640/41&#150;1704), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, is of unknown parentage and background. He was educated at Worcester grammar school before matriculating from Pembroke College, Oxford, as a servitor in 1655. Having left university without taking a degree he was appointed to the sequestered curacy of Ashchurch, Gloucestershire, but was ejected in 1660. After ejection he moved to London and &#145;taught a private Grammar School near Spitalfields&#146;, but after the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> in 1662 he &#145;went with Captain Blackwell into Ireland partly as his chaplain and partly as tutor to his eldest son; and returned to London in 1663 and kept school again&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.661). Here he acted as an assistant to William Hook (1601?&#150;1678), and on 20 April 1672 the two men were licensed as congregationalist teachers &#145;in the house of Richard Loton in Spittle Yard&#146;  (Gordon, 299). After 1679 Langston preached in Bedfordshire, before settling at Ipswich. Here a rumour was maliciously spread, and widely believed, that Langston was a Jesuit, and he was forced out of the town. In 1686 he returned, having married a wife, Susanna. As he records, on 12 October 1686, following extensive preparations, including sermons, &#145;several days of prayer and humiliation, and several conferences together&#146;, seventeen persons &#145;having on this same day related to each other what God had done for their souls, embodied together as a Church of Christ, giving themselves up to the Lord and one to another&#146;. At a meeting on 22 October these and thirty others &#145;elected and gave Mr Langston a call to the pastoral office&#146;  (Browne, 370). Having accepted on 29 October, he was inaugurated on 2 November. On 24 June 1687 the church held its inaugural meeting in the new chapel in Green Yard. In the mid-1690s Langston was paid by the Congregational Fund Board for work as a tutor. From November 1702 he was assisted in his ministry by Benjamin Glandfield (<i>d</i>. 1720). He died at Ipswich on 12 January 1704, aged sixty-three, leaving property to his wife, who survived him, and &pound;20 to the poor of his Ipswich congregation.<br>
