<span class="headword">Griffith <span class="st"> [Griffiths]</span>,  George</span>  (1618?&#150;1699<span class="mult">x</span>1702), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born a younger son in Montgomeryshire. The Griffiths enjoyed good relations with Sir Robert and Lady Brilliana Harley. On 2 November 1638 Griffith, aged nineteen, matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where he was a servitor to Sir Robert's son, Edward. When Griffith tired of service and desired to study divinity Sir Robert approved. Griffith graduated BA on 14 June 1642, and three years later proceeded MA from Emmanuel College, Cambridge. By parliamentary order of 13 February 1646 he became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
<br>On 6 June 1648 Griffith accepted an appointment as preacher at the Charterhouse, London, where his wife, Elizabeth, joined him by special indulgence in 1651 (the first woman permitted to live there). Recognizing his preaching ability, the Haberdashers' Company named him John Downham's successor as William Jones lecturer at St Bartholomew's Exchange in 1650, and two years later it appointed him to examine candidates for ecclesiastical preferments in the company's control. With John Owen, William Greenhill, and seven other ministers Griffith assisted a House of Commons committee in drafting a condemnation of the Socinians' Racovian catechism in February 1652, and the same year he and eleven other Independent clergy urged parliament to support missions to Native Americans; their letter was published in Henry Whitfield's <span class="italic">Strengthe out of Weaknesse</span> (1652). As the Rump Parliament debated doctrinal articles in 1653, Griffith and ten other clergymen drafted a statement in February insisting that no one be permitted to preach or publish anything opposed to Christian principles (of which they identified sixteen) plainly affirmed in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and deemed essential for salvation. In April, as John Durie prepared to leave for Sweden, he recommended Griffith, a young man &#145;zealous for the aime of Peace [and] no wayes engaged in any Party&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.95), to assist Richard Baxter's efforts to promote ecumenical unity, but Griffith, whom Baxter came to respect as godly and orthodox, was of little help.<br>
<br>Griffith was appointed to the commission for ejecting scandalous ministers on 28 August 1654 and the commission for the approbation of public preachers five days later. In the latter capacity he took special interest in seeing that qualified ministers were dispatched to his native Wales. When protestants in Piedmont suffered persecution, the council of state on 4 January 1656 appointed Griffith, Richard Cromwell, and others to a committee to provide aid, and two months later the council named him to the committee to draft statutes for Durham College. One of London's most prominent preachers, Griffith preached a fast sermon to the House of Commons on 30 October 1656. Two months later parliament appointed him to the committee to counsel the Quaker James Nayler following his sentencing. The council turned to Griffith again in July 1657, this time to mediate a dispute between two Scottish clerical factions, the resolutioners and remonstrants, and in October it appointed him to the commission for ejecting scandalous ministers in Middlesex. He again preached to the Commons on 27 January 1658, defending Cromwell's toleration policy and calling for increased financial support for ministers, especially in Wales and the north. He was also interested in protestantism's progress in Ireland, praising Henry Cromwell for supporting this endeavour. Presumably for his loyalty to the government, on 3 March 1658 he was appointed lecturer to the Independent congregation meeting in Westminster Abbey. In December, Richard Shute, as patron, recommended Griffith to the Triers for appointment as rector of St Mary's, Barnes, Surrey. In the meantime, following a meeting of elders of Independent churches in the London area in June 1658, Griffith invited congregational churches to send delegates to a conference at the Savoy Palace in September. At the conference, which produced a declaration of faith, he served as scribe. He was one of the few Independents who participated in Matthew Poole's efforts to support presbyterian and congregational students in the universities. During the political turmoil following Cromwell's death, Griffith conferred with Owen, Charles Fleetwood, and others, and he almost certainly joined Owen in supporting the Rump's recall in the spring of 1659. While Philip Nye and Thomas Brooks backed Desborough's attempt to preserve republican government by force, Griffith and Joseph Caryl opted to trust Monck and the convention.<br>
<br>Accepting the Restoration gracefully, Griffith joined other Independents in signing an address of loyalty to Charles in May 1660. Following Thomas Venner's uprising in January 1661 Griffith signed <span class="italic">A Renuntiation and Declaration</span> denouncing it. By the autumn he had lost his position at the Charterhouse, though an informer's allegation in December that he had spoken treasonably against the king was almost certainly baseless. Unable for reasons of conscience to take the oaths prescribed by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, Griffith resigned the Jones lectureship on 27 September 1662. Yet he refused to be silent, holding services with John Owen, George Cokayne, Thomas Goodwin, and Matthew Barker in a house near the Guildhall. A man of wealth, Griffith sent money to needy Independent and Baptist clergy in Wales during the 1660s. From 1666 to 1694 he ministered to a congregation that met first in Plasterers' Hall and subsequently in Girdlers' Hall. Following the fire of London, Baxter reported that more citizens attended the services of ministers such as Griffith and Owen than those in the parish churches. In 1669 Griffith shared a lectureship at Hackney with fellow congregationalists Owen, Nye, Brooks, and Peter Sterry, and the presbyterians Thomas Watson and William Bates. As congregationalist leaders Griffith and Owen counselled the Independent church at Hitchin, Hertfordshire, and John Bunyan's Bedford congregation identified Griffith's church as an appropriate place for its members to transfer to if they moved to London. When magistrates and ministers in Boston, Massachusetts, needed advice on a new president for Harvard, student recruitment, and financial assistance, they wrote to Griffith and eighteen others in August 1671; the latter responded in February. Under the declaration of indulgence's terms, on 22 April 1672 Griffith was licensed to preach at his house in Addle Street. Nearly a month earlier, Griffith, Owen, and Anthony Palmer had personally thanked Charles for the declaration.<br>
<br>Periodically Griffith was the subject of suspicion. The minister George Vernon depicted him as part of a congregational spy ring led by Owen. More serious was a government warrant in June 1671 to search his house for Richard Cromwell, weapons, and suspicious documents. He was under suspicion again in the summer and autumn of 1682, when he was zealously preaching against Catholicism and arbitrary government. Such views and his close friendship with Lord Wharton suggest that he held whig principles. By the spring of 1683 he was dangerously close to members of Monmouth's cabal as it planned an insurrection. Griffith, Owen, and Matthew Meade allegedly discussed such plans with William Carstares, and Monmouth himself exaggeratedly claimed that the three men and &#145;all the considerable Nonconformist Ministers knew of the Conspiracy&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/434/98). For preaching illegally he was fined &pound;20 in March 1684, and in October he was arrested as a dangerous person. Imprisonment, if any, was brief, for shortly thereafter he moved his congregation from Plasterers' Hall to Girdlers' Hall.<br>
<br>As crisis engulfed England in 1688 Griffith, William Bates, and John Howe supported the archbishop of Canterbury and six bishops when they protested against James's declaration of indulgence. In October the three men were part of a delegation that rebuffed James's request for support, though they pledged their prayers and obedience. Throughout the crisis Griffith, Bates, Howe, and Baxter worked to maintain nonconformist unity. By January 1690 tensions surfaced between Baxter and Daniel Williams on one side and Griffith, Cokayne, and others over the latter group's commendatory epistle to the Antinomian Tobias Crisp's <span class="italic">Christ Alone Exalted</span> (1689). Yet congregationalists and presbyterians established the Common Fund, with Griffith as one of fourteen managers, in 1690 to assist clergymen and educate ministerial students. He was also a founder of the Congregational Fund Board in December 1695. Four years later Griffith, Meade, Stephen Lobb, Richard Taylor, and John Nesbitt wrote <span class="italic">A Declaration of the Congregational Ministers</span> condemning the disruption caused by the Antinomian controversy. After making his will on 15 June 1698, in his eighty-first year, Griffith added a codicil on 29 June 1699. He died, presumably in London, between that date and 17 April 1702, when the will was proved. His will reflects his wealth: his eldest son, Richard, and his daughter Elizabeth had already received their portions, and thus had bequests of only &pound;20 and &pound;200 respectively, but Griffith gave his younger son, Henry, &pound;800 (reduced to &pound;320 in the codicil), and his other daughter, Anne, &pound;1000. Calamy described Griffith as &#145;very conversible, and much the gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>, 1.107). Historically Griffith's importance rests on the continuity of leadership he provided for the congregationalists from the late 1640s to the end of the century.<br>
