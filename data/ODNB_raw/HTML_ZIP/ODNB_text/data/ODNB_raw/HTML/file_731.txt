<span class="headword">Ascham,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1614, <em>d.</em> 1650), <span class="occ">diplomat and pamphleteer</span>, was baptized on 6 March 1614 in Boston, Lincolnshire, the son of Thomas and Cicilly (<i>d</i>. 1634) Ascham or Ascombe. Little is known of his parents, though Allen states he was descended of the same family as Roger Ascham. He attended Eton College from 1630 to 1634, and from there went to King's College, Cambridge. He was elected a fellow in 1637 and graduated BA in 1638 and MA in 1642. He took the parliamentary side during the civil war, although details of his service are somewhat obscure. He was appointed tutor to James, then duke of York, in 1646, when James and his brother, Henry of Gloucester, were put into the care of the earl of Northumberland. Although the extent of his service is unclear, in May 1650 an order in parliament was made for Ascham to be awarded money from the compounded estate of Julian de la Fountaine for his service in attending James. He was sent to Hamburg to negotiate with the Hansa over trade relations in the Baltic in 1649, and then to Spain in March 1650.<br>
<br>Ascham's major service to the parliamentary side had been in terms of propaganda published in support of the regime of the Rump Parliament after the execution of Charles I. His <span class="italic">A Discourse wherein is Examined what is Particularly Lawful</span> was first published in 1648, and then significantly expanded to be published as <span class="italic">Of the Confusions and Revolutions of Governments</span> in 1649 in the midst of the engagement controversy resulting from the introduction of the new loyalty oath by the republican regime. He also published <span class="italic">The Bounds and Bonds of Publique Obedience</span> in the same year, as well as a more speculative work, less closely connected with the debates over loyalty to the Rump, entitled <span class="italic">The Original and End of Civil Government</span>.<br>
<br>Members of the Rump not only had to justify the novelty of their regime in the face of traditional ties of loyalty to the crown, but also the presbyterian adherence to the loyal clauses of the solemn league and covenant, taken by them to amount to a binding oath. In <span class="italic">Confusions and Revolutions of Governments</span> Ascham argued that the nature of political authority was such that obedience was due to those performing those tasks for which government was originally set up, rather than to those with whom it was originally entrusted. It is this relationship he regarded as important, the action of a government maintaining justice, rather than strict virtue or relationships of loyalty. Furthermore, Ascham argued that to privilege such relationships, most significantly with the exiled Stuarts, was the self-indulgent action of one ruled by passion rather than reason, and an unwelcome and destructive intrusion of private ideas into the public sphere.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Bounds and Bonds</span> Ascham's argument is similar, focusing on the assertion that as long as the state performs its role of upholding justice, private individuals should not concern themselves with the legality of any regime. In <span class="italic">The Original and End of Civil Government</span> Ascham gives a justification for parliamentary government and resistance that pays no heed to the claims of custom or constitution. He reiterates the parliamentary argument, standard by 1649, about the original location of sovereignty in the people, the untransferable nature of their rights, and their right to judge tyranny. He goes on to argue that due to the passionate and inconstant nature of the people, their power of government needs to be transferred because anarchy is unacceptable. The recipients of such power by rights are the elected representatives of the people, set up to rule them: talk of lords or monarchs can be dismissed as irrational or mere custom.<br>
<br>Such views earned Ascham the derision of Edward Hyde, the committed royalist representative at the Spanish court, who urged that Philip IV should not accept an embassy from a regime that had killed a king. Ascham had been nervous for his safety since he arrived in Spain in April 1650, with George Fisher as a secretary and Giovanni Baptista Riva, a translator. He travelled to Madrid with a guard, arriving on 5 June, whereupon Don Diego de Moreda, the captain of the guard, pleaded illness, leaving Ascham in an inn which he felt was unsafe. The next morning he sent Fisher to find alternative accommodation, but before his return six English royalists burst into the inn and two of them, William Sparke and John Guillen, murdered Ascham and Riva. Ascham was buried in the courtyard of the inn.<br>
<br>Hyde wrote a pamphlet justifying Ascham's murder, the <span class="italic">Consideraciones dignas de atencion, y peso, sobre el caso de los cavalleros Ingeles</span>, a translation appearing in the first edition of his letters in 1773. Milton, however, praised Ascham, on behalf of parliament, as &#145;a person of integrity, learned and descended of an ancient family to treat of matters very advantageous as we hope as well to the Spanish, as to the English Nation&#146;  (Milton, 13.15). Sparke and Guillen, along with Valentine Progers, Henry Progers, William Harnet, and Edward Halsell, fled first to the Venetian ambassador, who took in only Henry Progers, who subsequently escaped. The rest took refuge in the hospital of St Andrea. When they were forcibly taken out of refuge and tried under Don Augustin de Hierro, the papal nuncio, Archbishop Giulio Rospigliosi, raised objections about the breach of sanctuary and no sentence was carried out. The dispute dragged on for several years, the prisoners remaining incarcerated; Valentine Progers died in 1651 and William Sparke was executed after an escape attempt in 1654. The rest escaped in 1656 after hostilities had broken out between Spain and Britain.<br>
