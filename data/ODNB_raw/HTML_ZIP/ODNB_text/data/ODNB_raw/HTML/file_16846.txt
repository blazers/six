<span class="headword">Lloyd,  John Augustus</span>  (1800&#150;1854), <span class="occ">engineer and surveyor</span>, the youngest son of John Lloyd of King's Lynn, Norfolk, was born in London on 1 May 1800. He was educated successively at private schools at Tooting and at Winchester, where he was taught some basic science. On a visit to Derbyshire he carried out a survey of the Wirksworth mines. The peace of 1815 prevented his obtaining a commission in the army as he had wanted, and he was sent out to his elder brother, who was king's counsel at Tortola (Virgin Islands). There John spent his time surveying and learning Spanish and French. After crossing to South America he presented an introduction, which had been given him by Sir Robert Ker Porter, artist and sometime British consul in Venezuela, to Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, the liberator of Colombia; he served for some years on Bol&iacute;var's staff as a captain of engineers, and ultimately attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In November 1827 Lloyd and Captain Maurice Falmarc, a Swedish officer in the Colombian military service, were granted permission by a rather reluctant Bol&iacute;var to survey the Isthmus of Panama and report on the best means of inter-oceanic communication. Bol&iacute;var was keen to encourage commerce among Central and South American countries, having in 1826 visited Panama as convenor of a conference which, among other things, promoted such trade; but, although he approved in theory of inter-oceanic communication, in practice he was not persuaded by any proposed schemes.<br>
<br>Work on the survey began in May 1828, but their progress was arrested by disturbances at Cartagena, where in helping to restore order Lloyd was severely wounded and narrowly escaped death. The survey was ultimately completed under immense difficulties, including heavy rain, dense forests, and attacks by the followers of General Sarda, the enemy of Bol&iacute;var. Lloyd and Falmarc recommended using the rivers and constructing a railway and canal to link the oceans. Theirs was the first canal proposed to suggest Lim&oacute;n Bay as the Atlantic terminus, a plan included in most subsequent schemes and finally carried out with the building of the present canal. Lloyd suggested the use of British convicts to construct the link. Soon afterwards he appears to have returned to England. His report on his survey appeared in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> (1830, 59&#150;68), with supplementary information in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> (1, 1830, 69&#150;101). On 11 March 1830 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was then employed, under the joint direction of the Board of Admiralty and the Royal Society, in determining the difference of level in the Thames between London Bridge and the sea. His report appeared in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> (1831, 167&#150;98).<br>
<br>In 1831 Lloyd went out to Mauritius, where he was appointed colonial civil engineer and surveyor-general. He arrived at Port Louis on 31 August 1831, and soon afterwards made a daring ascent of the Peter Botte (Pieter Both) Mountain, which was 823 metres high and previously regarded as unassailable. He recounted the adventure later in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span>, volume 3. During his twenty years' service in Mauritius he carried out many useful public works, including a breakwater for the inner harbour, the custom house, a patent slip for vessels of 600 tons, the colonial observatory, iron bridges, district churches, hundreds of miles of macadamized roads, and a trigonometrical survey of the island and the adjoining islets. He also compiled a new map of Madagascar, with a memoir, published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span>, volume 20. He left the island on 4 April 1849, and reached Europe by way of Ceylon. He made his way to Norway, and afterwards travelled through Poland, where he was temporarily detained by the Russian authorities at Cracow. On his release he visited the Carpathians, Vienna, the Tyrol, and France, and inspected the observatories <i>en route</i>.<br>
<br>Lloyd became an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849, and served on the council. His paper on the &#145;Facilities for a ship canal between the Atlantic and Pacific&#146; (<span class="italic">PICE</span>, 9, 1849&#150;50, 58ff.) was awarded the Telford medal. &#145;There was nothing&#146;, he wrote, &#145;but the climate and the expense to prevent a canal being cut from one sea to the other of sufficient depth to float the largest ship in her majesty's navy&#146;  (ibid., 60).<br>
<br>In 1851 Lloyd was special commissioner charged with organizing displays of manufacturing and industrial products for the Great Exhibition. He performed his work with indefatigable industry and by way of reward was appointed British charg&eacute; d'affaires to Bolivia on 4 December 1851. A paper which he wrote there on the mines of Copiap&oacute;, Chile, was published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> (1853, 23, 196&#150;212).<br>
<br>After the outbreak of war with Russia, Lloyd started on a mission to persuade the Circassians to support the British side. He was detained in the Crimea after the battle of the Alma to collect information, and died at Therapia of cholera on 10 October 1854. He left a widow, Fanny Drummond Lloyd (<i>d</i>. 28 Sept 1856), and family. Two of his sons were officers in the British army.<br>
<br>Lloyd was a man of immense energy and of much scientific aptitude. He published several papers, including those on Panama (<span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span>, 1, 1931, 69&#150;100); and on Mauritius (<span class="italic">Astronomical Society's Monthly Notices</span>, 3, 1833&#150;6, 186&#150;94; <span class="italic">Geological Society's Proceedings</span>, 3, 1842, 317&#150;18; <span class="italic">Proc&egrave;s Verbaux, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Histoire Naturelle, Mauritius</span>, 1846, 155&#150;6). His <span class="italic">Papers relating to proposals for establishing colleges of arts and manufactures for the industrial classes</span> was published privately in 1851. He made many drawings of Madagascar, and charts, mostly of South America.<br>
