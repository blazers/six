<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Terence Edward</span>  (1920&#150;1996), <span class="occ">polar scholar</span>, was born on 7 April 1920 at Oxted, Surrey, the youngest of three sons in the family of six children of Thomas Mandeville Emerson Armstrong (1869&#150;1922), director of the Commercial Union Insurance Company, and his wife, Jane Crawford Young (1881&#150;1945). The Armstrong family came originally from northern England, close to the Scottish borders, where they were sheep farmers, but during the plantation period they moved to Northern Ireland and became linen merchants. Although both of Armstrong's parents were from Ulster they had moved to England before any of their children was born. Terence Armstrong attended Winchester College, and while in the upper school heard a talk in 1937 by the distinguished Russian scholar Sir Bernard Pares, encouraging the boys to study the Russian language. A master at Winchester agreed to learn Russian and to keep a few lessons ahead of any pupil, and Armstrong, who had already shown an aptitude for learning languages and was a competent French speaker, was one of the first to take up the challenge.<br>
<br>In 1939 Armstrong went up to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to read modern languages, specifically French and German, but he was persuaded by the legendary Russian scholar Elizabeth Hill, who was recruiting for her new small department of Slavonic studies, to drop German in favour of Russian. He took first-class honours in French and Russian in part one of the modern languages tripos and graduated BA with a first-class degree in 1941. In the meantime, in 1940, he was obliged to join the army intelligence corps, where he was later commissioned. He served in north Africa, Italy, and the Netherlands, where he was parachuted behind enemy lines at Arnhem and wounded, but made his way back to allied lines south of the Rhine, and in Norway, where he was one of the first in the liberation of Oslo. On 20 December 1943 he married Iris Decima Forbes (1921&#150;1999), a ballet dancer.<br>
<br>In 1947, on demobilization, Armstrong returned to Cambridge and sought advice from Elizabeth Hill about his future. She advised him to apply to the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in the university, which was considering appointing a Russian specialist. Without any prior knowledge of polar studies Armstrong approached James Wordie, chairman of the institute's management committee and later master of St John's College, and applied for the post of research fellow in Russian studies. There was no formal interviewing board, but Armstrong also discussed the matter with the director of the institute, Launcelot Fleming (later bishop of Norwich), and Brian Roberts, who at that time was both acting librarian and archivist. Armstrong was appointed research fellow, and thus began a professional life of thirty-six years during which time he established for himself and for SPRI an international reputation for research in the polar north, and particularly the Russian Arctic. He was successively research fellow (1947&#150;56), assistant director of research (1956&#150;77), reader in Arctic studies (<i>ad hominem</i>, 1977&#150;83), and acting director (1982&#150;3). He retired in 1983, but carried on as adviser on Arctic affairs and supervisor of students' work.<br>
<br>Aside from his linguistics abilities, Armstrong became known as an economic and social geographer, yet he was never appointed as one:<blockquote>I never learned Geography as a single subject, but once appointed to SPRI I read all the standard textbooks in the subject. I was not driven by a boyish desire to find out about the Poles, but, like many others came to the subject by chance. (recorded interview, SPRI)</blockquote>He was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and often addressed its meetings. The society gave him the Cuthbert Peek award in 1954 and the Victoria medal in 1978.<br>
<br>Armstrong travelled widely in the Arctic, at first principally in Canada and Alaska, but as the cold war began to thaw he made many visits to Russia, including parts of Siberia seldom visited by scientists from the west. Through his writings his reputation as a polar scholar went ahead of him: using information gleaned from his daily reading of <span class="italic">Pravda</span> he published in the SPRI house journal <span class="italic">Polar Record</span> his analysis of shipping movements and mineral developments that were otherwise largely unknown to northern commentators within Russia itself. He forged lasting friendships with several Soviet academics, particularly academician Treshnikov, who later became the director of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute of St Petersburg, and Boris Kremer, a famous Soviet <i>polyarnik</i> (polar explorer), who stated: &#145;<i>In</i> <i>Russia</i> <i>his works are especially esteemed for their objectivity. Even though there was socialism and capitalism, what</i> <i>Terence</i> <i>did was tell the truth</i>&#146;  (Heap; italics in original).<br>
<br>Armstrong's doctoral thesis was published as <span class="italic">The Northern Sea Route: Soviet Exploitation of the North East Passage</span>, and at the time of his death he was the British representative on the international advisory committee on the northern sea route. In 1958 he published <span class="italic">The Russians in the Arctic: Aspects of Soviet Exploration and Exploitation of the Far North, 1937&#150;1957</span>, and in 1965 <span class="italic">Russian Settlement in the North</span>. After a flight across the north pole from Thule in northern Greenland, courtesy of the RAF in 1953, and a trip through the north-west passage in 1954 in the maiden voyage of HMSC <i>Labrador</i>, he researched ice conditions in the Arctic and published an <span class="italic">Atlas of Sea Ice North of the USSR</span>, and contributed with two colleagues at SPRI, Charles Swithinbank and Brian Roberts, to an <span class="italic">Illustrated Glossary of Snow and Ice Terms</span>, published in 1966.<br>
<br>In 1960 Armstrong became, with Eila Campbell of Birkbeck College, London, joint honorary secretary of the Hakluyt Society, a post he retained for twenty-five years. He saw more than fifty publications through the press, including his edition of <span class="italic">Yermak's Campaign in Siberia</span> (1966). He was a frequent traveller in the north of North America and was awarded in 1970 a scholarship by the national Science Foundation to contribute to the US programme &#145;Man and the Arctic&#146; and enjoyed a &#145;half-sabbatical&#146; at the campus of Fairbanks of the University of Alaska. While there he became good friends with Graham Rowley, science adviser to the Canadian department of Indian affairs and northern development, George Rogers, senior economic adviser to the state of Alaska, and Frank Darnell, a leading educator among the indigenous peoples of the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Together and with others they created a programme of seminars on cross-cultural education in the circumpolar north. Armstrong, Rogers, and Rowley published in 1978 <span class="italic">The Circumpolar North</span>, a major textbook the value of whose survey of scientific, political, and economic themes lasted some twenty years.<br>
<br>Armstrong became, in 1964, a foundation fellow of Clare Hall, one of the new graduate colleges in Cambridge, and was the first senior tutor in 1966 and vice-president in the 1980s. A former president of the college, Sir Michael Stoker, wrote: &#145;I never heard him speak ill of any-one&#151;I suspect that during nearly three decades Terence was the most popular member of Clare Hall. Everyone loved him&#146;  (Heap). He had a ready wit and an infectious laugh. He loved walking and music: he had taken up both oboe and cor anglais while at Winchester and for over forty years he contributed to the musical life of Cambridge. He was a confirmed member of the Church of England all his life and a regular attender of the parish church at Harston, Cambridgeshire, where for most of his professional life he and his family lived in a beautiful Queen Anne house, Harston House.<br>
<br>Armstrong died at his home on 21 February 1996, having suffered latterly from Parkinson's disease. He was cremated and his ashes were buried at the Cambridge crematorium on 1 March 1996. His wife died on 17 June 1999 and they were survived by two sons and two daughters.<br>
