<span class="headword">Holinshed <span class="st"> [Hollingshead]</span>,  Raphael</span>  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1580?), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the son of Ralph Holinshed or Hollingshead of Cophurst in the township of Sutton Downes, Cheshire. His cousin Ottiwell was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, from 19 December 1546, and though a layman was a canon of Windsor from 24 September 1550 until Mary's accession. Cooper in the 1850s reported the belief that Raphael Holinshed had been educated at Cambridge, and cited Thomas Baker's opinion that he had attended Trinity Hall. But Anthony Wood gave credit to a report that Raphael Holinshed was &#145;a minister of God's word&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.714), thereby associating Holinshed with the growth of protestantism in England, and this may explain why during Mary's reign, when he was probably in his late twenties and early thirties, he found employment in the London printing house of Reyner Wolfe, a committed evangelical, rather than seeking a living in the church. Wolfe employed Holinshed to assist him in his grand plan to create &#145;a universal cosmographie&#146;, a vast historical and geographical description of the world, complete with maps.<h2>
<a name="HolinshedandhisChronicles"></a>Holinshed and his Chronicles</h2>The first edition of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</span> appeared in 1577. It formed part of a deliberate movement to elevate the status of England, English letters, and English language through writing and publishing maps, histories, national epics, and theoretical works on English poetry. In April 1547 Reyner Wolfe had received a royal privilege as the king's printer in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew that, according to its patent, included the exclusive right to provide charts and maps useful or necessary to the king and his countries. Although Wolfe's universal cosmology, according to Holinshed's preface to the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, &#145;wanted little to accomplishment&#146; when Wolfe died in 1573, it was still incomplete a year later at the death of Wolfe's wife, Joan. Her will gave high priority to assuring Holinshed the &#145;benefit profit and commoditie&#146; promised by her husband &#145;concerning the translating and prynting of a certaine Crownacle&#146;; this was the first item after the bequest of Wolfe's substantial printing establishment to a son Robert and son-in-law, the haberdasher John Hun  (Plomer, 19&#150;23).<br>
<br>John Hun now joined John Harrison, the overseer of his mother-in-law's will and a prominent London printer, and together they formed a consortium with two members of the close-knit printing establishment at Wolfe's Brazen Serpent, Lucas Harrison and George Bishop, as the publishers of the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. For the printing they turned to Henry Bynneman, one of London's finest craftsmen and a man with considerable experience of printing histories&#151;in 1580 Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, and Sir Christopher Hatton secured for Bynneman the royal privilege to print &#145;all Dictionaries in all tongues, all Chronicles and histories whatsoever&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1578&#150;80</i>, no. 1594). In 1577 he completed the printing of Holinshed's monumental two-volume work, comprising 2835 small folio pages, besides preliminaries and indexes.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> that appeared in 1577 fell short not only of Wolfe's projected &#145;Polychronicon&#146; but also of Holinshed's expectations and the standards of some of the contributors. Holinshed's epistle dedicatory of 1577 to William Cecil, Lord Burghley (also printed in the 1587 edition) suggests not only that Burghley may have been Wolfe's patron, but also that Holinshed was concerned that his own work might be censured for falling short of Wolfe's original conception&#151;the &#145;universal cosmologie&#146; illustrated with maps. The epistle dedicatory blames the work's relatively limited scope on Wolfe's executors, who although they brought the <span class="italic">Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland</span> to fruition, earned little thanks from Holinshed for their efforts. William Harrison, the author of the &#145;Historicall description of the island of Britain&#146;, which prefaced the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, expressed concern that the speed with which he had written his contribution might have led to errors and omissions.<br>
<br>Whatever disappointments Holinshed himself may have felt about his published work, posterity has seen the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> of 1577 as a commercial success. It was certainly both an expensive book and an important one. One of the books that Robert Devereux, later second earl of Essex, bought when he went up to Cambridge in 1577, at &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. it was the most expensive volume among the young man's purchases (an investment equal to breakfast for the term). But its presence also suggests how informed Elizabethans were coming to place the understanding of their own history alongside the classics as part of the education of a young gentleman preparing for government service. How much &#145;benefit proffit and commoditie&#146; Holinshed actually enjoyed as a result of the publication of his &#145;Crownacle&#146; is not altogether clear. By 1 October 1578 he was in Bramcote, Warwickshire, acting as steward to Thomas Burdet, to whom he bequeathed his papers and books in a will that was proved on 24 April 1582. Wood reports that Holinshed probably died late in 1580.<h2>
<a name="TheChroniclesafterHolinshed"></a>The Chronicles after Holinshed</h2>In 1587 a second edition of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> appeared. It was a substantial undertaking. The colophon to this text indicates that it was printed <i>cum privilegio</i>, that is, under a royal privilege, by Henry Denham at the sign of The Star in Aldersgate at the expense of John Harrison, George Bishop, Ralph Newbury, and Thomas Woodcocke. The 1587 <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> required the financial support of these backers as well as their co-operation. John Harrison and George Bishop owned the Stationers' Company's licence for the book, but in 1584 Ralph Newbury and Henry Denham held the exclusive right to print chronicles and histories under the queen's patent, which they obtained from the estate of Henry Bynneman, who had died in 1583. Thomas Woodcocke had purchased Lucas Harrison's share in the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> from Harrison's widow. The stature of these printers and the extraordinary care they exercised in preparing the 1587 edition suggest that their concern to produce a distinguished history was as great as Wolfe's and Holinshed's had been, and since they controlled the project, they could produce a text that better met their expectations.<br>
<br>The seriousness with which Denham and the other publishers approached the second edition of Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> can be seen in the care with which it was prepared. While Reyner Wolfe had worked along with Holinshed in compiling the 1577 edition, the second edition's publishers placed the project in the hands of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9693/', "Abraham Fleming")</script>, a &#145;learned corrector&#146; who worked extensively with Henry Denham  (Donno, &#145;Abraham Fleming&#146;, 205). Acting as general editor between 1585 and 1587, Fleming revised the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> and extended the English history to 1586. Among his inclusions were Thomas Churchyard's accounts of Elizabeth's progress to Suffolk and Norfolk in 1578 and of the elaborate tournament devised by Philip Sidney, Fulke Greville, and the earl of Arundel for the French ambassadors in 1581, Lord Burghley's pamphlet <span class="italic">The Execution of Justice</span> (1583), and parliament's demand in 1587 for sentence of death against Mary, queen of Scots, along with Elizabeth's refusal to execute her.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> of 1587 were printed in three volumes in large-folio format gathered in six. William Harrison's &#145;Historical description&#146; and the &#145;History of England&#146; to 1066, both carried over from the 1577 edition and each signed and gathered independently, comprise the first volume. The second volume consists of the description and history of Ireland, revised and continued by John Hooker, and the description and history of Scotland, similarly treated by Francis Thynne. Again, each is signed and gathered independently. Volumes 1 and 2 are generally bound together. Volume 3 is the &#145;History of England&#146; revised and continued by Fleming, although substantial parts of the continuation were contributed by John Stow.<h2>
<a name="Thecensoredtexts"></a>The censored texts</h2>Both editions of the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> underwent censorship. The first edition came to the privy council's attention in December 1577 because of Richard Stanyhurst's contribution to the &#145;History of Ireland&#146;. The council ordered John Aylmer, bishop of London, to stay the sales until the text could be reformed, and he called upon the eleventh earl of Kildare to present Stanyhurst to the council. On 13 January 1578 the council ordered the bishop to release the stay once he received notice from Burghley as lord treasurer that the revisions Stanyhurst had agreed to make were completed. While the <span class="italic">Short title catalogue (STC)</span>, second edition, notes three cancels in the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> of 1577, only the F<sub>7</sub> gathering appears to contain significant changes. The revision toned down the text's strong bias against Kildare's grandfather, the ninth earl, and removed some disparaging remarks about Archbishop John Alen.<br>
<br>On 1 February 1587 the privy council wrote to Archbishop John Whitgift of Canterbury requesting &#145;the staye of furder sale and uttering&#146; of a &#145;new booke of the Chronicles of England &hellip; until they shall be reviewed and reformyd&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1585&#150;7</i>, 311). The concern expressed in this order was specifically directed towards the recent additions made &#145;as an augmentation to Hollingsheades Chronicle&#146; that contained<blockquote>sondry thinges which we wish had bene better considered, forasmuch as the same booke doth allso conteyne reporte of matters of later yeeres that concern the State, and are not therfore meete to be published in such sorte as they are delivered.</blockquote>The order included the appointment of reviewers experienced in those state matters that warranted &#145;reformation&#146;: Henry Killigrew, Thomas Randolph, and John Hammond.<br>
<br>Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> of 1587 were castrated and reformed in three stages. The hands of Randolph, Killigrew, and Hammond clearly dictated the earliest stage of censorship evident in the earliest revised state of the text. Their work removed passages in the continuation of the Scottish history that might jeopardize Anglo-Scottish relations, especially those concerned with English intervention in Scottish factional politics. In the continuation of the &#145;History of England&#146; their reforms enhanced the stature of Leicester, distanced England from the duc d'Alen&ccedil;on, who had recently offended the Dutch, and polished accounts of English legal practice to insist that trials and executions in England were administered fairly and according to due process of law. The censors apparently acted with the speed required by the privy council's order, since the first stage of the censorship was probably completed during the first week of February. This can be detected in one cancel in the &#145;History of Scotland&#146;, containing revised text that refers to the &#145;now imprisoned queene of Scotland&#146;  (p. 443, sig. A6&#150;7). Since the page with this reference was reset, the initial review and reformation, including the resetting of the cancel leaves, must have taken place within a week of the initial order for censorship and before Mary's execution on 8 February 1587. Then, once the text had been reformed to meet Killigrew's, Randolph's, and Hammond's requirements, it was fine-tuned, probably by Whitgift, since at this stage censorship eliminated much of a long history of the archbishops of Canterbury.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>' final revision, very likely dictated by political developments that followed the completion of the first and second reformations, reflects a careful attempt to cultivate good opinions both at home and abroad, and especially abroad, ahead both of English efforts to negotiate a settlement in the Low Countries and of the expected response to the execution of Mary, queen of Scots. Finally, in addition to the important matters of state reflected in the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>' censorship and reform, the factional interests of certain councillors affected the text early and late, in particular the rivalry at court between the earl of Leicester, whose sympathies rested with international protestantism, and his more conservative opponents, notably William Brooke, Lord Cobham, and Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, who had both been appointed to the privy council in February 1586.<h2>
<a name="Textualvariations"></a>Textual variations</h2>All the castrations and cancels appear in the sections of the 1587 <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> that extended Holinshed's earlier histories of Scotland and England. Besides the few extant copies of the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> that escaped castration and reformation, some copies exist that contain variant cancels together with more original leaves than the state of the text described in the <span class="italic">STC</span>. The greatest number of original leaves, formerly part of a broken copy of the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, survives in a fragment now in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California. This fragment represents the earliest state of the Holinshed text, and its cancels reflect the reformations indicated by Killigrew, Randolph, and Hammond. The second state of the &#145;reformed&#146; text appears in a privately owned copy of the 1587 <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. At each of these sites, when the original leaves, the Huntington Library fragment, and the private copy cancels and their adjacent leaves are compared with the <span class="italic">STC</span> cancels and their adjacent leaves, it can be seen that the textual reformations reflect a continuous process of revision, one completed by the time the book reappeared in the bookshops in 1587. Although <span class="italic">STC</span> suggests that the text was censored again in 1590 at the request of James VI of Scotland, in fact James relented in his demand and the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> were not recalled.<br>
<br>Without a census of extant copies of Holinshed's 1587 <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>, it is unclear how many copies reflect each successive state of the text. Since the sale was stayed and the subsequent reformations made within a month of the book's completion and initial publication, copies with a fully uncensored text appear to be very rare. And although a particular copy may predominantly reflect a given state of the text of 1587, two circumstances may produce yet more variation. It is possible that in any one copy, where leaves should have been castrated and replaced with cancels, the site none the less may have been overlooked and the castration not made. Thus original leaves in one site (or more) may coexist in a copy with cancels elsewhere. Conversely, a castration may have been made, but the cancel not added. As a further complication, besides the variations that may have been produced in the sixteenth-century printing house, some copies of the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> result from changes produced by antiquarian interests in the eighteenth century. Between 1723 and 1728 three facsimile reprints of the castrated leaves were sold, with the clear intention that they should be sophisticated into existing copies of the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> to replace cancels and missing leaves. Consequently many copies of the 1587 edition have eighteenth-century leaves sophisticated at one or more of the castration sites. A third edition published in 1807&#150;8 restored the censored passages but reordered the descriptions and histories and changed attribution practices.<h2>
<a name="Literaryandhistoricalsignificance"></a>Literary and historical significance</h2>Although Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> have been appreciated as a useful resource for sixteenth-century history, scholars have also tended to ignore their integrity. Their importance as a source for several of Shakespeare's plays&#151;they underlie not only all the conventional English history plays, but also <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, and <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>&#151;has long been understood, but otherwise until late in the twentieth century historians were apt to consign the <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> to the margins of study, as either a vestige of medieval historiography or the sixteenth-century equivalent of a coffee-table art book, a commercial rather than an intellectual product. From the mid-1980s, however, the development of cultural studies has led to a renewed interest in Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> as the product of the emergent English nationalism of the end of the sixteenth century. The <span class="italic">Chronicles</span> may be regarded as a secular equivalent to John Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, a massive and wide-ranging work of scholarship which served as a source for Holinshed, his colleagues, and successors.<br>
