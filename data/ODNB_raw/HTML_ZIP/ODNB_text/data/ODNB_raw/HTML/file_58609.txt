<span class="headword">Malatesta,  Errico</span>  (1853&#150;1932), <span class="occ">anarchist</span>, was born in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, Caserta province, Italy, on 14 December 1853, the son of Federico Malatesta, a landowner, and his wife, Lazzarina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rostoia. He attended school in Santa Maria and then at the Scolopian college in Naples. Inspired by contemporary republican ideals and the actions of Mazzini and Garibaldi, he displayed revolutionary tendencies from an early age. At fourteen he was arrested for writing an insolent letter to the king, Victor Emmanuel II. His interest in social justice soon led him from republicanism to socialism, and by 1870 he adopted the ideas of the International, which, under the influence of Michael Bakunin, had acquired an anarchist slant. He abandoned his medical studies at Naples University after three years and devoted himself to his work as an agitator and propagandist for libertarian socialism. Arrested in July 1873, he was imprisoned for six months.<br>
<br>After his release Malatesta, along with fellow radicals Bakunin, Carlo Cafiero, and Andrea Costa, developed a plan for a nationwide revolt. The authorities were forewarned of their rising, in Bologna in August 1874, and acted quickly to suppress the rebels. Acquitted of any wrongdoing, Malatesta travelled in Italy, Spain, and the Ottoman empire. In accordance with his theory of propaganda by deed&#151;which envisaged acts of insurrection, attacks on institutions, and acts of appropriation&#151;Malatesta and an armed band of conspirators next set out to foment insurrection in the hills of Benevento province in April 1877. In the village of Letino they proclaimed the social revolution, distributed money and arms, and destroyed government records&#151;and received a sympathetic response from the villagers. The band was captured by troops, and Malatesta imprisoned for more than a year for his part in the revolt. After the attempted assassination of King Umberto I in November 1878, opponents of the Italian government faced harsh repressive measures and Malatesta escaped to Alexandria before moving to Geneva, where he helped Peter Kropotkin to produce the anarchist communist newspaper <span class="italic">Le R&eacute;volt&eacute;</span>. Having renounced his family inheritance, he trained in Paris as a mechanic in order to be able to support himself. Expelled from France, he travelled through various countries, briefly visiting London, and endured spells of imprisonment in Lugano, Paris, and Brussels.<br>
<br>In March 1881 Malatesta took up residence in London. At first he found it difficult to earn a living, and was obliged to sell pasta and ice-cream until he could establish himself as a mechanic. He quickly made the acquaintance of anarchists and socialists in the city, and attended the Rose Street Club along with Frank Kitz and Kropotkin. He helped to arrange the congress of the International in London in June 1881, where he urged the different revolutionary groups to aim for greater organization and unity. For a time after the congress he worked for a bureau established in London to organize communications between European revolutionary groups. In August 1882 he left England for Egypt to join the revolt of &#145;Urabi against the European powers.<br>
<br>In 1883 Malatesta returned clandestinely to Italy with the aim of unifying the diverse groups of libertarian socialists there and halting any drift on their part towards engagement in the parliamentary process. His pamphlet <span class="italic">Fra contadini</span> (1884), which took the form of a dialogue in which a young peasant outlines to a sceptical older worker reasons for adopting the anarchist cause, became one of his most popular works. Sentenced in 1884 to three years' imprisonment for belonging to a &#145;criminal association&#146;, he skipped bail and sailed to Argentina. After four years in South America he left Argentina in 1889 for Europe, and after being unmasked by a police spy in Nice, he again sought refuge in Britain.<br>
<br>For the next seven years Malatesta based himself in London, and made further friends in radical circles, including William Morris and the anarchist writer Max Nettlau. Although he occasionally travelled to the continent to observe or take part in insurrections, he lived for much of this period at 112 High Street, Islington, and rented a workshop where he worked as a mechanic. In his spare hours he produced numbers of <span class="italic">L'Associazione</span> with the aim of promoting unity among the disparate libertarian revolutionary groups. In 1891 he published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">L'Anarchia</span>, which provides one of his clearest summaries of his anarchist communist beliefs. From 1894 to 1896, when the severest repression of anarchists on the continent took place, numbers of exiles arrived in London, and Malatesta offered sanctuary to those he could at his lodgings in Islington. At the London congress of the Second International in summer 1896, which Malatesta helped to organize, libertarian socialists came into conflict with the Marxist majority. In spite of Malatesta's efforts to unify the different anti-authoritarian groups, the anarchists were expelled from the organization.<br>
<br>In 1897 Malatesta returned to Italy, and secretly from his rooms at 24 via Podest&agrave;, Ancona, produced the influential anarchist journal <span class="italic">L'Agitazione</span>. In his writings he endorsed a move towards syndicalism (which brought him into direct conflict with Kropotkin) and recommended the formation of an organized anarchist &#145;party&#146;. The police eventually arrested Malatesta, and imprisoned him on the mainland and later on the island of Lampedusa&#151;from where he escaped by boat, and travelled on to London and then to the United States, where he lived in New Jersey. His life was threatened at an anarchist meeting at West Hoboken in that state when an outraged opponent drew a revolver and shot at him, slightly injuring him. He later toured Cuba and addressed crowds there before returning to London in April 1900.<br>
<br>Malatesta resided in London for the next thirteen years, and earned his living as a mechanic and an electrician. He also attended anarchist conferences and meetings, and wrote essays for a broad range of British and continental anarchist journals. He reiterated his belief in the importance of revolutionary actions&#151;defending, for example, the anarchist assassins of King Umberto I and President McKinley, but he also began to express growing disillusionment with syndicalism. He was accused of complicity in the Houndsditch raid of December 1910, which culminated in the Sidney Street siege, after an oxygen cylinder used by the criminal gang was traced back to his workshop in Duncan Terrace, Islington. Malatesta managed to demonstrate that this connection was purely innocent. In May 1912 he again faced gaol. Having accused an Italian called Ennio Belleli of being a police spy, Malatesta was found guilty of defamation, sentenced to three months in prison, and recommended for expulsion as an &#145;undesirable alien&#146;. His supporters organized a rally in Trafalgar Square, addressed by R. B. Cunninghame Graham, George Lansbury, and Josiah Clement Wedgwood, and published articles in his defence in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> and <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. The Independent Labour Party conference passed a resolution against his expulsion as contrary to the principle of asylum for political refugees, as no crime by him was involved, and Labour MPs raised his case in parliament. In June 1912 the Liberal home secretary, Reginald McKenna, announced his decision not to carry out the deportation.<br>
<br>Scenting revolutionary possibilities in Italy, Malatesta returned there in 1913 and participated in the insurrections of &#145;red week&#146; in June 1914, after which a warrant was issued for his arrest. He fled and lived for the duration of the First World War in London. Adopting an anti-militarist position in accordance with anarchist principles, he was highly critical of Kropotkin and other anarchists who supported the allied cause. In 1919 Malatesta returned to Italy, where he edited the anarchist daily newspaper <span class="italic">Umanit&agrave; Nova</span>. Facing strikes and insurrection, the government imprisoned him without charge for nine months from October 1920. When the fascists seized power in 1922, they set about suppressing the independent press, and Malatesta was forced again to earn his living as a mechanic. He spent the last ten years of his life in Rome, with his partner, Elena Melli, and her daughter Gemma. In spite of his age and international renown, the fascist authorities imposed increasing restrictions on his freedom. Latterly a police post was set up in the corridor leading to the doorway of his apartment, at 8 via Andrea Doria, where he died of bronchial pneumonia on 22 July 1932; he was survived by Elena. Under police instruction, Italian newspapers were silent about his death, and only a small group of his family and friends were permitted to attend his burial at the Campo Verano cemetery, Rome, two days later.<br>
<br>According to the testimony of a police captain, Malatesta was an &#145;intelligent, combative speaker, who [sought] to persuade with calm, and never with violent, language&#146;  (Richards, 215). He drew praise from his associates for his qualities of warmth, sincerity, courage, and resolve, and&#151;as the outcry over his threatened deportation from Britain illustrated&#151;won the admiration of many outside revolutionary circles.<br>
