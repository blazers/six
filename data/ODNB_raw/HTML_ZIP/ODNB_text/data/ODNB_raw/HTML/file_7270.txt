<span class="headword">Davies,  Walter</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gwallter Mechain]</span>  (1761&#150;1849), <span class="occ">antiquary and poet</span>, was born on 14 July 1761 at Y Wern, near Tomen y Castell, Llanfechain, Montgomeryshire, one of the seven children of William Davies, a labourer, and his wife, Catherine Bennett (<i>b</i>. 1733). He developed an early passion for books from his mother, who was respected in the area for her learning. As a boy he spent much of his time in the company of local poets and was educated by the parish priest until the age of twelve. He was thereafter apprenticed to a cooper and practised his craft in a barn near Tomen y Castell.<br>
<br>In 1789, taking the bardic name Gwallter Mechain, Davies became an eager competitor for prizes at the local eisteddfodau, which were being fostered in north Wales by the Gwyneddigion Society of London. This brought him to the attention of Owen Jones (Owain Myfyr), a literary patron, whose financial assistance enabled him to obtain a place at St Alban's Hall, Oxford, in 1791. He subsequently obtained a clerkship at All Souls College, and in 1792 worked as curator at the Ashmolean Museum, where he gained access to some of the manuscripts of the Welsh scientist and philologist Edward Lhuyd. He read widely during this period, taking an interest in medicine and astrology as well as in literature and antiquities. He graduated BA from Oxford in 1795, and shortly afterwards was appointed curate at Meifod in Montgomeryshire. He proceeded MA as a member of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1803. In 1797 he was invited by the board of agriculture to compile a survey of agriculture and the domestic economy in north Wales. This was published in two volumes in 1810 and 1813, and followed in 1815 by a second report on south Wales, on which he collaborated with Edward Williams (Iolo Morganwg). On 15 October 1799 Davies married a widow, Mary Pryse of Rhosbrynbwa, at Meifod. They had four children.<br>
<br>In 1807 Davies was appointed rector of Manafon in Montgomeryshire, where he became associated with a group of antiquaries later known as <i>yr</i> <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95356', "hen bersoniaid llengar")</script> (literally &#145;the old literary clerics&#146;). From 1818 onwards, together with John Jenkins (Ifor Ceri), William Rees of Cascob, and others, Davies sought zealously to promote regional eisteddfodau and to encourage the publication of Welsh literary and historical manuscripts, thus, in effect, continuing the work of Owain Myfyr and the Gwyneddigion Society. He also worked with Daniel Rowland of Llanddewibrefi to found provincial societies throughout Wales to stimulate interest in literature and antiquarian scholarship.<br>
<br>Davies was greatly respected by his contemporaries as an adjudicator of poetry at eisteddfodau. He insisted upon the classical canons of criticism favoured by Goronwy Owen and other poets of the mid-eighteenth century. His own obsessive urge to compete for literary prizes continued into old age, yet his work has little merit and is seldom read today. His most enduring work was as an editor of the works of major poets such as Huw Morys (1823) and Lewys Glyn Cothi, whose work he edited in collaboration with John Jones (Tegid) in 1837. On 18 November 1837 Davies became vicar of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, in Denbighshire. He died there on 5 December 1849 and was buried in the churchyard.<br>
