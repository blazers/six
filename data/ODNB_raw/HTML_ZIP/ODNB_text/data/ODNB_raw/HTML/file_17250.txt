<span class="headword">Lyle,  Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1859), <span class="occ">physician and poet</span>, the son of Robert Lyle and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cochrane, was born in Paisley on 10 September 1792, and was educated at Paisley grammar school. He attended medical classes at Glasgow University. About 1815 he set up as a druggist in the High Street of Glasgow, and in 1817 he was licensed as a surgeon by the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. He practised in Glasgow for ten years before moving to Airth, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire. In 1853 he returned to Glasgow, where he found employment as surgeon to the Barony district parochial board during the cholera epidemic of 1853&#150;4. He seems not to have enjoyed much success as a doctor. He was of a retiring disposition, happiest on botanical excursions, collecting old ballads, or writing verse for his own amusement.<br>
<br>Lyle is remembered solely for the still popular song &#145;Let us haste to Kelvin Grove, bonnie lassie&#146;, written in 1819 and first published in the <span class="italic">Harp of Renfrewshire</span> (1820). Some controversy arose as to the authorship, owing to the ascription of the song, by an editor of the <span class="italic">Harp</span>, to John Sim. The story is told by Hugh Macdonald in <span class="italic">Rambles Round Glasgow</span> (2nd edn, 1856):<blockquote>Mr. Sim, who had contributed largely to the work &hellip; left Paisley before its completion for the West Indies, where he shortly afterwards died. In the meantime the song became a general favourite, when Mr. Lyle laid claim to it as his own production, and brought forward evidence of the most convincing nature (including letters from Sim himself) to that effect. (pp. 283&#150;4)</blockquote>It appeared that Sim had transcribed the song in his own hand and his executors concluded that it was Sim's. To the end of his life Lyle felt some bitterness at the mistake that had compelled him to prove authorship of his own work. The 1872 reprint of the <span class="italic">Harp</span> still attributed &#145;Kelvin Grove&#146; to Sim. Lyle contributed to R. A. Smith's <span class="italic">Irish Minstrel</span>, and edited <span class="italic">Ancient Ballads and Songs</span> (1827). The latter work contains his own poems and songs, including a revised version of &#145;Kelvin Grove&#146; and a section of <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems, by Sir William Mure, Knight of Rowallan</span>. His own poems reflect his private interests, being filled with botanical references or modelled on old songs, with a romantic morbid cast over all. Lyle died of typhus fever, at his house, 61 Duke Street, Glasgow, on 19 April 1859, and was buried in the cemetery of the West Relief Church, Paisley, on 23 April. He was described as a widower on his death certificate, but nothing is known about his wife.<br>
