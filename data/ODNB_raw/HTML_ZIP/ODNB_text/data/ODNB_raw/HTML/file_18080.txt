<span class="headword">Marmion, Sir  Philip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1291), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son of Robert Marmion and Juliana, daughter of Philippe de Vassy. He succeeded to his estates about 1241&#150;3. He married Joan, daughter and coheir of Hugh of Kilpeck, and on 7 February 1244 he performed homage for his wife's share of the Kilpeck estates. In July 1249 he was appointed sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire, and on 6 February 1252 was pardoned for trespasses in that office. Partly as a result of this he became heavily indebted to the crown, and an arrangement was made for paying this off by instalments in 1253. In that year he went with the king to Gascony, and was captured on his return journey with the earl of Warwick and others at Pons in Poitou. From 1258 he was summoned on several occasions to expeditions against Llewelyn. In 1260 he replaced James Audley as a justice on special eyres arranged for the redress of grievances in Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>A royalist, Marmion was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk during 1261&#150;2, and was appointed warden in the counties of Nottingham and Derby in December 1263. He was among the party who submitted evidence on behalf of the king to Louis IX, resulting in the mise of Amiens in January 1264. After Evesham he was granted the lands of Montfortian rebels in seven counties, and on 26 September 1266 he received the king's demesnes of Tamworth and Wigginton for life. This was to bring him into serious conflict with the tenants of both manors. He bought houses in London and, when leasing them, reserved the right to reside there on visits to the capital. In the fourteenth century it was stated that the Marmion manor of Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire, was held by the grand sergeanty of performing the office of king's champion at the coronation, but whether Marmion actually performed that office for Edward I is unknown. He died on or before 5 December 1291. He had four daughters, three with Joan, namely Joan, Mazera, and Maud, and a fourth, another Joan, with his second wife, Mary. The estates were divided between these children. There was also an illegitimate son, Robert.<br>
