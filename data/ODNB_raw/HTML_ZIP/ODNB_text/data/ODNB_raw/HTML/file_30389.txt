<span class="headword">Allen,  Percy Stafford</span>  (1869&#150;1933), <span class="occ">Erasmian scholar</span>, was born at 2 Twickenham Park, Twickenham, Middlesex, on 7 July 1869, the younger son and fourth child of Joseph A. Allen (1825&#150;1910), a London bill broker. The Allens were a distinguished and old-established Quaker family, but Joseph Allen had been obliged to leave the Society of Friends on marrying &#145;out&#146; to Mary Mason (<i>d</i>. 1892), youngest daughter of Hans David Christopher Satow and sister of the Anglican diplomat and historian Sir E. M. Satow. Percy Allen was educated at Clifton College (1882&#150;8) and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he was a scholar (1888&#150;92), taking a first class in classical moderations (1890) and a second in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1892).<br>
<br>In 1884 Allen had accompanied his father on a visit to Gibraltar, Morocco, and Malta for the Anti-Slavery Society; in 1893 he travelled with a pupil in Australia and New Zealand. After returning to Oxford at the end of that year, he won the chancellor's prize for a Latin essay (on the character of Alcibiades) in the summer of 1894. In 1896 he took his MA and became a master at Magdalen College School. Appointed professor of history in the government college at Lahore in 1897, he visited England in the summer of 1898, to marry on 20 September his cousin Helen Mary (1872&#150;1952), daughter of Arthur John and Agneta Allen, of Chislehurst, where Joseph Allen had built himself a house. They had one child, a daughter, who died at birth in 1906.<br>
<br>The climate of India seriously affected the health of both Allen and his wife, and in 1901 he resigned his Lahore professorship and returned to Oxford, where the rest of the Allens' life was spent. Initially they were supported by an annual &pound;250 from Allen's father and by small earnings from minor academic and administrative chores; the death of Joseph Allen in 1910 relieved financial pressure. In 1906 a project to make Allen a research fellow of Corpus Christi failed, but in 1908 he was elected to a fellowship of Merton College, which he held until 1924, becoming an honorary fellow in 1925. He filled various college offices, notably that of librarian (1915&#150;24), bringing order into the college archives and early holdings, as well as publishing <span class="italic">Merton Muniments</span>, a facsimile and edition of some of its earliest documents, with his friend H. W. Garrod in 1928 and having a large part in similar publications by others. The fellowship carried no teaching duties, but for many years Allen continued the lectures he had first given in 1906 on the tradition of the classics. In 1924 he was elected president of Corpus Christi College; he retained this office until his death.<br>
<br>Allen's name will always be associated with his masterly edition of the correspondence of Erasmus, <span class="italic">Opus epistolarum Des. Erasmi Roterodami</span>. His interest in Erasmus dated from 1892 when, immediately after taking his first degree, he competed unsuccessfully for the chancellor's English essay prize. The subject was Erasmus. In 1893&#150;4 he attended the lectures on the life and letters of Erasmus by James Anthony Froude, who influenced him profoundly: he always maintained that <span class="italic">The Life and Letters</span> (1894) was better than any other book on Erasmus, and on the day on which Froude died he began to read his <span class="italic">History of England</span>, which he would never willingly hear disparaged. Allen's first published book was <span class="italic">Selections from the Writings of James Anthony Froude</span> (1901). His virtually flawless scholarship and his gentle, impartial temper make his admiration for Froude seem paradoxical. But he was a man incapable of paradox and, on the main issues of the Reformation, he believed Froude to have been right.<br>
<br>During his four years in India, Erasmus's correspondence continuously preoccupied Allen. On 22 June 1901 he and his wife were cutting up earlier printings of the letters to form, along with the extensive collections he had made in the Netherlands and Germany between 1893 and 1896, a basis for a new edition. After the Allens' return to Oxford in 1901 they regularly (the 1914&#150;18 war years excepted) spent spring and summer in European libraries, collating the known material and bringing to light an immense amount of material hitherto unknown. They were aided in 1904 by a small private gift, part of which was spent on a typewriter, and later by modest financial support from the Clarendon Press, which also intervened to allay anxieties about putative rivals. Every letter was copied fair in the library where the manuscript (or the first printed text) was to be found. The copy so made became the &#145;printer's copy&#146;, with no intervening transcript. The proof of each letter was corrected in the library where the original copy had been made. In the decipherment of difficult fifteenth- and sixteenth-century hands Allen had no rival. Nobody knew the texts of the Reformation as well as he; to nobody were the lives of the great and little men of the Reformation so intimately familiar; he knew them and their writings, and anything that anybody else had written about them, at first hand. Ingram Bywater called him &#145;the most learned man in Oxford&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and the <span class="italic">Opus epistolarum</span> is one of the great monuments of English learning.<br>
<br>The first volume in this first critical edition of Erasmus's correspondence appeared in 1906, and the eighth was published posthumously in 1934, with Allen's portrait for a frontispiece and his life by Garrod, in Latin, by way of introduction. Allen had left it to his wife, his collaborator since the beginning, and to Garrod to complete the last three volumes; for these he had collected the materials, but without furnishing commentary and introductions. Volumes 9&#150;11 appeared between 1938 and 1947; an index compiled by Barbara Flower, completed and edited by Elisabeth Rosenbaum, was published as volume 12 in 1958. Reissued in the 1960s and reprinted entire in 1992, the edition still holds the field unchallenged for accuracy and comprehensiveness. Text apart, &#145;Allen&#146; is, in its commentary and introductions, &#145;a treasure-house of unborrowed learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), the beginning of a new era in Erasmus scholarship, in which Erasmus is presented, in his own words, fully but sparely and impartially. Moral and historical judgement is left to the reader, who is deemed to share the familiarity of Allen with language, persons, and issues, as well as his affection for Erasmus and his appreciation of Erasmus's situation. The most important single printed source for the intellectual history of western Europe during pre-Reformation and Reformation times, the <span class="italic">Opus epistolarum</span> contains more than 3100 letters, 1600 of them by Erasmus himself, as against the 1800 in total printed by Jean Leclerc in 1706. Its texts are based almost entirely on known manuscripts, where Leclerc had often to rely on printed texts. Its datings, on which Erasmus chronology often depends, have stood the test of time remarkably: only a handful of finished letters, with a number of drafts, have since come to light. Its commentary (Leclerc had effectively none), though inevitably now dated, is still indispensable. &#145;Allen&#146; is the starting point for the correspondence, and for much else, in the edition of the complete works of Erasmus in English issued by Toronto University Press (1974&#150;) and for Toronto's companion biographical register, <span class="italic">Contemporaries of Erasmus</span> (1985&#150;7), while in the Amsterdam edition of the complete works in Latin, also in progress, the correspondence has been judged less in need of immediate attention because of &#145;Allen&#146;.<br>
<br>Besides the <span class="italic">Opus epistolarum</span>, Allen published his prize essay (1894), some single lectures, a little volume of <span class="italic">Selections from Erasmus</span> (1908), and eleven lectures in <span class="italic">The Age of Erasmus</span> (1914). In 1924 he and his wife published jointly <span class="italic">Sir Thomas More: Selections from his English Writings and from the Lives by Erasmus and Roper</span> (presenting a view of More which, like their view of Erasmus, was somewhat sentimental); and in 1929 they edited the <span class="italic">Letters of Richard Fox, 1486&#150;1527</span>, the correspondence of the founder of Corpus. In 1934 there appeared posthumously another volume of Erasmian studies by Allen, <span class="italic">Erasmus: Lectures and Wayfaring Sketches</span>. One of his services to scholarship was the suggestion to the department of printed books in the British Museum that they should produce a series of short-title catalogues of books published before 1600 in France, Italy, Spain, the Low Countries, and Germany. The first such to be published, of French books, appeared in 1924.<br>
<br>Allen received honorary degrees from the universities of Leiden (1922), Birmingham and Louvain (1927), and Durham (1931); between 1909 and 1930 he became, by invitation, foreign, honorary, or extraordinary member of academies or learned societies in Amsterdam, Antwerp, Ghent, Leiden, and Utrecht; in 1923 he was elected fellow of the British Academy. In 1925 his sense of what was required of the head of a college led him to take his DLitt at Oxford.<br>
<br>Allen was himself an indefatigable letter writer: he wrote easily and copiously, in a minute and precise hand, to family and friends and was prompt in dealing with official correspondence. To Sir Aurel Stein, his closest friend since their meeting at Lahore, he wrote weekly until Stein begged him to write only fortnightly. The selection of letters published in 1939 by Mrs Allen exhibits happily a single-minded scholar of simple tastes, regular habits, personal modesty, care for his friends, and devotion to Erasmus, his works, and his ideals&#151;Allen was a supporter of the League of Nations&#151;a man of moral principle and lovable and saintly character. They give only a superficial impression of his presidency of Corpus Christi, election to which the Allens privately called &#145;the miracle&#146;. The election process was protracted, and Allen's eventual appointment was controversial among both undergraduates and influential fellows. He was well-meaning and conscientious, but he had neither taste nor aptitude for debate or for university administration. To individual undergraduates he was kind, presenting them all with his edition of the letters written by the founder, Bishop Fox. Yet he and his wife seemed remote and unworldly, entertainments at the lodgings were stiff and for some even painful, and there were embarrassing disciplinary problems. There could be no question, however, that Allen's devotion to the college rested upon a deep knowledge of its origins, and his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist thought that on scholarly grounds he was &#145;almost the ideal Head of a House&#146;.<br>
<br>Besides his Latin and Greek, Allen had excellent French and German and could converse in Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and Hindustani. Personally frugal though unobtrusively generous and considerate to others, he defined his recreations as foreign travel and bicycling; both were pursued with a degree of hardiness. In youth he had rowed for his college, and he remained supportive of its boat club. Tall and spare, upright and unhurried but unpompous in carriage as in all things, careful in dress, pale in complexion, he wore his dark hair cut short; like his small moustache it greyed in later life. His eyes were hazel and he habitually wore spectacles.<br>
<br>For thirty years Allen occupied seat S8 in Selden End of the Bodleian Library, of which he was a curator from 1913 and a benefactor; from 1915 to 1924 he was a curator of the Indian Institute. He died in the president's lodgings at Corpus Christi, after a protracted illness, on 16 June 1933. After a funeral service on 20 June he was cremated at Reading; his ashes were buried near the altar in Corpus Christi chapel, which, as an Anglican with doctrinal reservations, he believed should be the centre of college life. The P. S. Allen junior research fellowship in history at Corpus Christi was founded by a bequest from his widow. Her own contribution to their scholarly collaboration was acknowledged by several honours: she received honorary doctorates from the universities of Basel (1946) and Amsterdam (1948) and an honorary MA degree from Oxford (1932), and was elected an honorary fellow of St Hilda's College, Oxford (1944).<br>
