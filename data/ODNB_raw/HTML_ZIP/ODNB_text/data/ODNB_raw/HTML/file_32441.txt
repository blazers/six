<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clementi, Sir  Cecil</span>  (1875&#150;1947), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 1 September 1875 at Cawnpore in India, the eldest child of Colonel Montagu Clementi (1839&#150;1919), judge advocate-general in India, and his wife, Isabel Collard (1850&#150;1930). He was educated at St Paul's School in London and at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was elected a demy. Studying classics and Sanskrit, he received a first class in classical moderations in 1896, the Boden Sanskrit scholarship in 1897, a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1898, and the chancellor's Latin essay prize in 1899.<br>
<br>In 1899 Clementi came fourth in the competitive examination for posts in the home, India or colonial civil service and selected Hong Kong as his first choice. He was appointed a Hong Kong cadet that year and on arrival in Hong Kong was sent up to Canton (Guangzhou) to learn Cantonese. Unrest on the Chinese mainland resulted in his return to Hong Kong in July 1900. He was to spend the next twelve years working in the administration there, with the exception of two secondments, to India in 1902 and to Kwangsi (Guangxi) province in 1903. From 1903 to 1906 he had the arduous task of registering land titles in the New Territories in Hong Kong. On 16 April 1912 he married (Marie) Penelope Rose Cobbold Eyres (1889&#150;1970), the beautiful daughter of an admiral based in Hong Kong. They had four children; Clementi adored Penelope, and she was a constant support throughout his career.<br>
<br>Clementi was sent to British Guiana as colonial secretary in 1913. He remained there until 1922, administering the government on three occasions during his tenure. From there, he was posted to Ceylon as colonial secretary and also administered the government once. In October 1925 he was appointed governor of Hong Kong, only the second cadet to achieve this position. The colony was at that point in a state of extreme civil unrest. A general strike and boycott was paralysing the colony's trade and relations between Hong Kong and China had rarely been worse. Clementi immediately instigated informal talks with the authorities in Canton. His negotiating stance was stern but open and within a year the boycott was over and diplomatic relations repaired. Overcoming the major physical and economic threats from China throughout 1925 and 1926 was an undoubted victory for Clementi. An extremely active governor, he also introduced effective measures to counteract further communist penetration of the unions and brought in important public health, factory, and employment legislation. He also took steps to improve Hong Kong's water supplies following the severe drought of 1928&#150;9. Other achievements during his tenure included the nomination of the first Chinese member to the executive council and improving the balance in the annual budget. Clementi's major disappointment in Hong Kong was his lack of success in persuading the London government to extend land leases in the New Territories beyond 1997. In 1930 Britain returned Weihaiwei in north China to the Chinese and Clementi argued that this rendition should have been used as a bargaining counter to secure Hong Kong for Britain beyond 1997.<br>
<br>In 1930 Clementi was transferred to the governorship of the Straits Settlements following the sudden retirement of the previous incumbent on health grounds. The post, which incorporated the duties of high commissioner of the Malay states, was one of the most important in the empire. The administrative organization he inherited was complex and unwieldy and he decentralized the administration whenever possible in moves he hoped would eventually defederalize the states. He also introduced administrative posts for members of the indigenous population and supported Malayan culture and language in his reorganization of the education system. Many of these moves were unpopular with the Chinese and Malay populations and at times, notably in his educational and administrative reforms, Clementi was forced to compromise. With hindsight, his undiluted reforms would probably have been the better option for the region. In Singapore he developed diabetes and as a result was forced to retire in 1934, his work in the area unfinished.<br>
<br>Clementi was tall and slim and it was the opinion of his peers that he was both hard-working and extremely intelligent. Despite his sometimes controversial approach to colonial administration and his propensity for giving notice of his gubernatorial actions retrospectively to London, he was highly rated within the Colonial Office. He was appointed CMG in 1916, KCMG in 1926, and GCMG in 1931 for his services. A fine negotiator who was charming in private, he preferred academic pursuits to parties and found great joy in travelling. He travelled to all of the Chinese provinces and took every opportunity to explore the countries in which he worked. His twin beliefs of equality of opportunity and education determined many of his actions as a governor. A scholar who was fluent in several Chinese dialects, his translations of Chinese love poems are charmingly phrased. His two publications on British Guiana remain important sources of information on the area.<br>
<br>Clementi was closely associated with the foundation of the University of Hong Kong and was chancellor from 1925 to 1930. He was awarded an honorary LLD by the institution in 1926. His support included writing the anthem (in Latin verse) for the university in 1912, gifting an important collection of Chinese books, and raising funds for the study of Anglo-Chinese cultural relationships. He spent his retirement in Britain writing and studying. He died of heart failure at Holmer Court, Holmer Green, near High Wycombe, on 5 April 1947; his ashes were buried in Penn Street church, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>A creative administrator in the Straits Settlements and one of Hong Kong's most distinguished governors, a reassessment of Clementi's historical importance during the height of British imperialism is long overdue. In his own lifetime he was acknowledged as one of Britain's brightest and most able colonial officers. However, his proposals for reforms in Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements frequently caused conflict with the local populations. Many of his ideas on equality and education were decades ahead of colonial policy but his interventionist tendencies have been criticized by historians writing since his death.<br>
