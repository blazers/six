<span class="headword">Robarts family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1780&#150;1914), <span class="occ">bankers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_48041"></a><span class="headword">Abraham Robarts</span>  (1745&#150;1816)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 27 September 1745 in Stepney, Middlesex, the son of Captain Abraham Robarts and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wildey. He married Sabine, daughter of Thomas Tierney and sister of the Rt Hon. George Tierney MP, sometime leader of the whig opposition, on 16 June 1774. Well connected in the political world, the family was also well placed in the City of London. Already a director of the Royal Exchange Assurance by 1781, West India factor, and East India Company director (1788&#150;92, 1793&#150;7, 1799&#150;1803, 1804&#150;7), Abraham Robarts went into partnership with Curtis, Were, Hornyold, and Berwick of Cornhill in 1792, and was based at 15 Lombard Street, the site of the old Lloyd's Coffee House, from 1795. Besides his London banking interests, he was also a partner in Lechmere's Bank at Worcester, and thus began a long family connection with this city. As a successor to Edmund Lechmere he held the seat in parliament as a whig, was returned unopposed in 1796, and fought off challenges in 1802, 1806, and 1812. He had unsuccessfully contested Wootton Bassett in 1784. His parliamentary career was relatively pedestrian, but he was known to have been a &#145;staunch friend&#146;  (Thorne, 23) of the abolition of the slave trade and to have voted both for an inquiry into ministerial corruption and for parliamentary reform.<br>
<br>Economics and politics also mixed when Robarts was the &#145;leading man&#146;  (Cope, 58) of Walter Boyd's consortium in 1794, and when his firm donated &pound;30,000 to the loyalty loan in 1797. He was an advocate of the &#145;principle and strict practice of banking&#146;  (Pressnell, 412) and the company, by the turn of the century, were already &#145;princes amongst London agents&#146;  (ibid., 405). In March 1806 a consortium of which he was a member secured the government loan contract. In this instance, as in others, Robarts was uncompromising in his attitude towards business. Similarly, in the series of banking panics of December 1825, 1836, and November 1840 his firm was seen as a rock amid the uncertain waters of some stormy financial weather. His forthright language and approach were not confined to his dealings with Pitt, government ministers, or his connections in the City, but extended to his colleagues in the country banks. Good practice may have begun in London but certainly, he believed, it should not have ended there.<br>
<br>This attitude, however, masks both Robarts's generosity towards his family and his voluntarist spirit. He was a commissioner of lieutenancy for the City of London and colonel of the first regiment of the East India volunteers. Accordingly, on his death at Taplow on 26 November 1816, aged seventy-one, he left money to the relief of distressed officers in the East India Company, to his servants, and to all his clerks in the bank. Despite his lukewarm political support for George Tierney, he made substantial bequests to the Tierney family in his will. However, he left the lion's share of &pound;350,000 and a country estate to the eldest of his four sons and &pound;10,000 to each of his three daughters. His middle sons, George and James, were left &pound;33,892 and &pound;22,251 respectively.<br>
<br>Unlike most of his siblings, <a name="cosubject_49285"></a><span class="headword">William Tierney Robarts</span>  (1786&#150;1820)<span class="occ"></span> of 49 Lower Grosvenor Street, Middlesex, the fourth son of Abraham, became involved in the family business. Having already been given &pound;20,000 during his father's lifetime, he was left a further &pound;10,000 at Abraham's death. He remained unmarried. As a merchant in Old Broad Street from 1810 he became a director of the family bank. He was also a director of the Bank of England between 1810 and 1820. As a member of parliament he enjoyed the favour of Earl Spencer, and sat for St Albans from 1818. Like his father and eldest brother he was a whig, and like them he remained neutral or even hostile to Catholic relief. He was a regular attender but was not known to have spoken in any debate. However, he voted against indemnifying ministers for their conduct in suspending habeas corpus but voted for borough and parliamentary reform. He died prematurely on 9 December 1820, leaving a sum of &pound;25 each to his supporters in the constituency, anxious to be remembered in &#145;good opinion and esteem&#146;  (Thorne, 24) by friends and family alike.<br>
<br>Although William occupied an important position in the family concern, <a name="cosubject_48042"></a><span class="headword">Abraham Wildey Robarts</span>  (1779&#150;1858)<span class="occ"></span>, his eldest brother, was the main beneficiary of his father's success, and the vessel in which his aspirations continued to travel. Born on 1 August 1779, he was educated at the Revd Thomas Horne's school, Chiswick. In 1794 he gained an East India writership in China. After seven years he joined his father in the family partnership in Lombard Street. By the time he inherited his father's business in 1816, it had already been known as Robarts and Curtis for twelve years, and two years later it became Sir William Curtis, Robarts, and Curtis. He married Charlotte Anne, daughter of Edmund Wilkinson of Potterton Lodge, Tadcaster, Yorkshire, on 20 January 1808. Unlike the older partner, Curtis, who was leader of the tories in the City of London, the younger Robarts was a whig. It was thought he would inherit his father's seat in Worcester but he sat instead for Maidstone, in place of Sir Robert Thomas Wilson, and in every parliament from 1818 until he eventually retired in 1837. As the nephew of George Tierney and with resources gleaned from the family business, he came top of the poll. He voted with the opposition on most issues.<br>
<br>With Abraham Wildey Robarts as chairman of the committee of bankers, the company prospered, and it changed its name under his stewardship in 1833 to Robarts, Curtis &amp; Co., a promotion of the family's position. As a noted collector of fine, mainly Dutch, paintings he left the social reputation of the Robartses in an even better condition than he found it. He died at his home, 26 Hill Street, Berkeley Square, Mayfair, on 3 April 1858, aged seventy-nine, after a very brief illness. The Robarts family interest went on to amalgamate with Sir John William Lubbock &amp; Co. in 1860. As one of the last private banks, Robarts Lubbock &amp; Co. itself amalgamated with Coutts &amp; Co. in July 1914. At the time the business had nine partners, capital of &pound;500,000, and deposits and current accounts of &pound;4,130,850. It was a move that united a City bank and clearing-house with one based in the West End. It also had the effect of uniting country banking interests with those of the City of London. The place of the Robarts family in the polity had been consolidated and then advanced.<br>
