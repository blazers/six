<span class="headword">Thornton,  John</span>  (1720&#150;1790), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, was born on 1 April 1720, the only son of Robert Thornton of Clapham, Surrey, and his first wife, Hannah Swynocke. His father was a merchant, and became a director of the Bank of England. After his death Thornton inherited the Clapham estate and about &pound;100,000, which he increased greatly in the Russian trade. A large part of Thornton's income was devoted to the encouragement of a gospel ministry in various parts of the world. Much of this money was donated anonymously through third parties so that he would not have excessive demands on his charity, and it is impossible to discover the extent of his charitable gifts. In 1772, for example, he got a Mr Bentley to purchase 1000 copies of a hymnbook published by the Revd Dyer of St George's, Southwark, which had failed to sell. These were to be sent to Lady Huntingdon for distribution. Similarly he employed the Revd Thomas Scott of the Lock Hospital in London to distribute bibles in England and Wales.<br>
<br>Although Thornton was a devout evangelical Anglican and disliked Wesleyans and Baptists, his support extended to most protestant denominations. The Revd William Bull who trained Independent ministers at Newport Pagnell was a close friend; the Revd Mr Winter also took some of his students. His allowance for a student was 25 guineas a year, and in 1783 he supported three. For these and other evangelical curates he endeavoured to find livings, with only limited success. When he was unable to persuade the lord chancellor to appoint them to crown livings he resorted to buying advowsons which he eventually placed in a trust, with Henry Venn and two other clergy as trustees. In 1783 he responded to a request from Lady Huntingdon on behalf of an Essex curate with the statement that he was considered &#145;a speckled Bird&#146; with no influence  (Thornton to Lady Huntingdon, 7 Oct 1783, Cheshunt archives, F1/554). Even his contribution to building new churches at Clapham and elsewhere did not give him the power to appoint a minister.<br>
<br>Thornton travelled widely in later life and used every opportunity to advance the evangelical cause. During a long stay at Swansea in 1783 he rented a room in the town for occasional preaching as there was no gospel ministry. He also visited Scotland, St Edmund Hall in Oxford (the home of Calvinistic Methodist students), and Lady Huntingdon's training college for ministers at Trefeca, near Brecon. Although he made no donation to the college he did assist Lady Huntingdon with a loan at no interest. In 1761 he and George Whitefield handled the negotiations by which she bought the advowson of Aldwincle All Saints, Northamptonshire, to save the patron, John Kimpton, from bankruptcy. Better known was his gift of &pound;200 a year to John Newton while curate of Olney, Buckinghamshire, which he increased when Newton took charge of the affairs of the poet William Cowper. Thornton's closest association was with his brother-in-law, the Revd Richard Conyers, rector of Helmsley, Yorkshire, whom he described as his chaplain. He related how on one occasion he persuaded Conyers to enter a Quaker meeting.<br>
<br>On 28 November 1753 Thornton married Lucy (1722&#150;1785), the heir of Samuel Watson of Hull. They had four children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27362/', "Samuel Thornton (1754&#150;1838)")</script>, who went into business and became a director of the Bank of England; Robert, who went into parliament; Jane, who married the earl of Leven; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27357/', "Henry Thornton (1760&#150;1815)")</script>, who continued his father's religious and charitable work. Thornton died on 7 November 1790 as the result of an accident at Bath and was buried at Clapham. Notwithstanding his many benefactions he died a very wealthy man, able to leave &pound;40,000 to the youngest of his sons (his other bequests are not known). Henry described his father as &#145;rough, vehement and eager&#146;  (Forster, 11), and disapproved of his behaviour, but was greatly influenced by his example.<br>
