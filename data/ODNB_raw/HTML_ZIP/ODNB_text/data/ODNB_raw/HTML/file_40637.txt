<span class="headword">Sherratt,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1718, <em>d.</em> 1788), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and social reformer</span>, was baptized on 20 June 1718 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the son of William Sherratt and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trusler. Sherratt (who also spelled his name Sherrott) had a varied and eventful career as a businessman, through which he became involved in politics, foreign affairs, and social reform. He was twice married: first to Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1759), and, second, to Sarah, who survived him; further details of his marriages are unknown. He had numerous children, of whom his eldest surviving son, John, acted as an executor for his will.<br>
<br>Sherratt began life as a London hatter, feltmaker, and broker. He continued his work as a broker and auctioneer throughout his career, dealing in a variety of goods and advertising his business in the London newspapers. It was typical of Sherratt's spirit and ingenuity that his bankruptcy (25 January 1746) did not hinder him from exploiting new business opportunities. In partnership with his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27777/', "John Trusler")</script>, he now became a manager of London's Marylebone Gardens, which he undertook alongside his broker business in Soho. In the long term, however, both ventures failed to bring the rewards which Sherratt sought, and he filed individually as a Soho bankrupt in April 1754, and jointly with Trusler as a result of financial difficulties with the Gardens three months later.<br>
<br>By this date Sherratt had his eyes on another prize, the privateer <i>Antigallican</i>. Sherratt was an active member of an antigallican association, and foiled his creditors once more by secretly investing his assets in the ship. As the probable author of the pamphlet <span class="italic">The Antigallican Privateer</span> (1757) Sherratt described the fate of this first privateer of the Seven Years' War. Having sailed from Deptford on 17 September 1756 the <i>Antigallican</i> captured two French ships before seizing the booty-laden French East Indiaman the <i>Duc de Penthi&egrave;vre</i> off the coast of Spain. But disaster then struck, as the Spanish took possession of both the <i>Antigallican</i> and its prize at Cadiz in February 1757. Sherratt's account reveals obvious anger and disappointment. Despite a personal visit to Cadiz, as well as further publications and petitions by the association and attempts to involve the prime minister, William Pitt, the goods of the <i>Antigallican</i> were never restored.<br>
<br>Yet another of Sherratt's business schemes had ended unsuccessfully. However, his interests in English liberties now took him in a new direction&#151;the reform of private madhouses&#151;which benefited others as well as himself. On 22 May 1766 Sherratt, describing himself as a notary public, gave an affidavit to the court of king's bench about his recent rescue of Hannah MacKenzie from a private madhouse in Paddington where she had been wrongfully imprisoned by her husband. He claimed that his help was sought by MacKenzie's friends because they knew he had<blockquote>caused several cases to be delivered at the door of the Honourable House of Commons &hellip; complaining of the cruel acts which have been committed in private Mad houses in this Kingdom to the great oppression, injury, and unlawful confinement of many of His Majesty's Subjects. (TNA: PRO, KB 1/16/4)</blockquote>Sherratt was probably alluding to the pamphlet (of which he is the likely author) <span class="italic">A Case Humbly Offered to the Consideration of Parliament</span> (1763), which contained a letter from MacKenzie thanking Sherratt for his services in the second edition (1766). Sherratt was well aware that many would doubt the honesty of his intentions in such cases. He told the king's bench that he acted &#145;from principles of humanity and compassion and for the public good&#146;, and that &#145;he hath had no gratuity or reward for such his good offices&#146;. Yet in view of Sherratt's character, it seems unlikely that he let a potentially profitable business opportunity pass him by. Certainly, he had already obtained a reputation as the rescuer of the wrongfully detained, a celebrity recorded by the poet Christopher Smart, whose <span class="italic">An Epistle to John Sherratt, Esquire</span> (1763?) was published after he had been liberated by Sherratt from Mr Potter's madhouse at Bethnal Green. While it remains unclear how many people Sherratt helped to free, or how much he stood to profit, he should be credited for bringing the abuses of the private asylums to public notice. But his public works were not enough to impress the writer on music Sir John Hawkins, who was appalled when Sherratt sought to become a Middlesex justice of the peace in 1769. Given that he had twice been declared bankrupt, Hawkins believed that Sherratt's name would be a &#145;disgrace&#146; to the magistracy  (Davis, 226). Sherratt was never sworn in as a Middlesex justice, though he remained on the Westminster Commission until 1775.<br>
<br>On 8 November of that year Sherratt was appointed consul for Cartagena, Spain. This was his final change of occupation but, like so many of the other careers, it also ended in disaster. On arriving in Cartagena in May 1776 he quarrelled first with his Spanish vice-consul and then with John Burrows, who had accompanied him to Spain. His disagreement with Burrows resulted in a fight in a public tavern, upon which Sherratt was arrested and imprisoned. Having brought disgrace upon the consulate Sherratt returned to England in early 1777. In 1780&#150;81 he was advertising his auction business once again. His petitions to the government, stating that in Cartagena he had been used as a political tool and pleading for financial recompense, evidently fell upon deaf ears. His will, in which he described himself as &#145;his Majesty's late Consul at Cartagena&#146;, left just 1<i>s</i>. to his wife. None the less he directed his executors to &#145;countenance and assist all my daughters in their several trades or businesses if they &hellip; should be deemed worthy of favour&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1165/213). His mixed fortunes as an entrepreneur had apparently not diminished Sherratt's desire that his daughters should follow in his footsteps. He died on 5 January 1788 at Hammersmith, Middlesex.<br>
