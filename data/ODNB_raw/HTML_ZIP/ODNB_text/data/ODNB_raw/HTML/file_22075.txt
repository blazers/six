<span class="headword">Peverel <span class="st"> [Peverell]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1419), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was said by John Bale in the sixteenth century to have been of good birth, but no connection has been established with any of the several notable families with his surname. He was a member of the Carmelite friary at Bishop's Lynn, Norfolk, by 1377, and became BTh of Oxford University. On 31 July 1387 he was summoned before the lord mayor and aldermen of London, for reasons unknown. On 17 June 1392 he attended the trial of the heretic Henry Crump at Stamford, and in the following year was appointed second <i>socius</i> to the prior-general of his order. On 25 October or 3 November 1395 he was papally provided to the see of Ossory in Ireland, with restitution of temporalities on 4 February following. This was a see under English control, but Peverel secured licence to live in England on 19 May 1396, and nominated attorneys in Ireland on 30 July. His translation on 12 July 1398 to Llandaff was said by the pope to be from Leighlin, another see in the English pale, but this seems a simple error. The temporalities were restored on 16 November.<br>
<br>Although there is no explicit evidence, it seems very probable that he was among the handful of monks and friars whom Richard II kept around his court in his last years, to considerable criticism. Indeed, on 17 March 1399 he was appointed chancellor to the child Queen Isabella. The fall of the king ended any such role at court, but Peverel was never implicated in any die-hard Ricardian plotting. Probably, he devoted himself quietly to his little Welsh diocese, whence in the summer of 1402 he was forced to flee by Owain Glyn D&#373;r's rebels. This at least would have ensured any necessary reconciliation with the Lancastrian crown, and on 12 May 1405 he received letters of protection to go with Henry IV on a projected expedition into Wales. However, his diocese remained too dangerous to occupy, especially as Glyn D&#373;r had now developed firm plans for an all-Welsh episcopate under the Clementist obedience. Peverel was obliged to mark time as a suffragan for Bishop Henry Beaufort, performing ordinations at Winchester on 6 March 1406, and on 12 March and 5 May 1407.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1407 Peverel was translated to Worcester, receiving his temporalities on 20 November. This was quite notable preferment for a man of his background, especially from a dynasty that had usurped his original patron. Presumably the crown wished to make plain its firm support for anyone who had fallen foul of rebellion against itself. The promotion did not mean that Peverel now had any active public role under the dynasty, although he attended parliaments regularly. He settled down to run his diocese. Archbishop Thomas Arundel once had occasion to remind him formally to observe the constitutions of the province, but his register suggests that he was a conventionally conscientious diocesan, willing and able to move around between his residences. His register ends in 1417&#151;both the general <i>acta</i> (April) and his record of ordinations (August)&#151;but this seems more likely to be a misfortune of survival than sure evidence of suddenly failing powers. He died intestate (as his order required) on 1 March 1419 and was buried in the Carmelite house in Oxford. He seems to have had an equivocal reputation. While John Bale described him 150 years later as a scholar of long standing and an admired preacher, an opponent in the papal curia in 1407 said he was &#145;of evil life and bad character &hellip; a simple-minded man, ignorant of law and insufficient in learning&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Arch. Selden B.23, fols. 113<i>v</i>&#150;114). With Peverel, it was very much a matter of the light in which he was viewed.<br>
