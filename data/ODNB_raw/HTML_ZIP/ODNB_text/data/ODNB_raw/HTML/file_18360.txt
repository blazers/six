<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mauduit,  Israel</span>  (1708&#150;1787), <span class="occ">colonial official and political writer</span>, was probably born at Bermondsey, London. He was descended from a French protestant family who settled at Exeter early in the seventeenth century. His father, Isaac Mauduit (1662/3&#150;1718), the first dissenting minister at the chapel of St John's or King John's Court, Bermondsey, died on 8 April 1718, aged fifty-five; his mother, Elizabeth (1671/2&#150;1713), died on 10 March 1713, aged forty-one. Mauduit was educated for the dissenting ministry at the Taunton Academy and he afterwards travelled abroad with several other young men of the same opinions. He preached for a time both at The Hague and in England. His career as a minister was brief, however, for soon he became a partner in a woollen draper's business in Lime Street, London, with his brother Jaspar, and with James Wright, Jaspar's son-in-law. They did an active business in Virginia, North America, and enjoyed substantial commercial success. On 13 June 1751 Mauduit was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>In 1763, with the influence of Lord Bute, Mauduit was appointed customer of Southampton. In this period he was also helping his brother, who had been appointed agent for Massachusetts Bay in the previous year but who now suffered from ill health. In this latter capacity Israel acted mainly as a contact man and lobbyist: he obtained for the province partial compensation for military expenditures during the Seven Year's War; he organized resistance to George Grenville's <span class="roman">Sugar and Stamp Acts</span>; and he oversaw a bill through parliament for the promotion of whale fishing in Massachusetts. This bill reduced the duty on whale fins to a nominal figure, thereby putting colonial fishermen on a more equal footing with their British rivals. Once the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> riots erupted in America, Mauduit gradually became an outspoken critic of colonial actions and a firm supporter of George III and, after 1770, the North ministry. Once his brother had been replaced as agent by Richard Jackson, Mauduit ceased to act formally for the colony, but he developed a friendship with and acted as private agent for Thomas Hutchinson, governor of Massachusetts from 1771. Mauduit successfully pleaded Hutchinson's case for a fixed salary out of customs revenues, and in 1774, together with the British solicitor-general, Alexander Wedderburn, he defended Hutchinson against Benjamin Franklin's ill-judged attempt to remove him as governor.<br>
<br>Mauduit first rose to literary prominence as the author of a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Considerations on the Present German War</span> (1760), a work that at once established his reputation as a leading polemicist. Selling over 5000 copies in five editions within a few months, <span class="italic">Considerations</span> was a compelling attack on the policy of continental intervention promoted by William Pitt, and on the large army and expenditures that this required. The pamphlet stimulated and shaped a fervent press debate on British strategy that continued throughout the remainder of the war and turned many former supporters against the European conflict. Other pamphlets published by Mauduit included <span class="italic">A letter to the Right Hon. Lord B&#151;y, being an enquiry into the merits of his defence of Minorca</span> (1757); <span class="italic">Occasional Thoughts on the Present German War</span> (1761); and <span class="italic">Some thoughts on the method of improving the advantage accruing to Great Britain from the northern colonies</span> (1765). He also published two histories, one of the New England colonies and one of Massachusetts Bay (both 1769), and he proposed <span class="italic">The Case of the Dissenting Ministers</span> with a bill for their relief in 1772. During the American War of Independence he offered <span class="italic">Remarks upon General Howe's account of his proceedings on Long Island in the &#145;Extraordinary Gazette&#146; of Oct 10, 1776</span> (1776) and <span class="italic">Observations upon the conduct of S&#151;r W&#151;m H&#151;e at the White Plains, as related in the &#145;Gazette&#146; of December 30, 1776</span> (1779). By this date Mauduit had provided Governor Hutchinson with a statement supporting American independence. On 6 May 1787 he was chosen to succeed Richard Jackson as governor of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Mauduit died, unmarried, at Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London, on 14 June 1787.<br>
