<span class="headword">Blamire,  Susanna</span>  (1747&#150;1794), <span class="occ">poet</span>, known as the Muse of Cumberland and the Poet of Friendship, was born on 12 January 1747 at Cardew Hall, near Dalston, Cumberland, the youngest of the four children of William Blamire (1703&#150;1758), a yeoman farmer of the Hollin estate (later named The Oaks), and Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simpson (1709&#150;1753), of the nearby manor of Thackwood Nook, Stockdalewath, whose mother was a Richmond of the neighbouring manor of Highhead Castle. Susanna's parents died when she was a child, and on her father's death she went to live at Thackwood with her widowed aunt, Mary Simpson (1703&#150;1785), a shrewd but unfailingly kind woman. Her brother William, a distinguished naval surgeon, was married to Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Christian (1749&#150;1837), sister of John Christian Curwen (1756&#150;1828) MP and agricultural reformer. Susanna's other brother, Richmond, was the London publisher of many of William Gilpin's books on the picturesque.<br>
<br>After briefly attending the dame school at Raughton Head, Susanna is thought to have been taught at home by assistants from the distinguished grammar school at nearby Sebergham, where the poet Josiah Relph had been headmaster. By mid-adolescence she already had a wide and discriminating literary knowledge. She was a tall, sociable, and &#145;bonny and verra lish young lass&#146;  (Blamire, <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, xxiii). Her face was slightly marked by smallpox (which Giacomo Cambruzzi tactfully ignored in his portrait of her of about 1778). Her brother William commented that the most vivacious youths of his day were dull and phlegmatic in comparison with his lively sister. Indeed her passion for dancing was so extreme that if she met travelling musicians on the road she would dismount and dance to a jig or hornpipe.<br>
<br>Blamire often wrote poems beside a stream in her own garden at Thackwood, sometimes playing an air on her guitar or flageolet, and occasionally pinning her verses to oak trees, where they could be read by passers-by. She was able to broaden her horizons, and master the music and phrasing of Scottish song, as a result of her sister Sarah's marriage in 1767 to Colonel Thomas Graeme of Duchray Castle, Stirlingshire, an officer in the Black Watch. She was introduced to a circle at Gartmore House that sympathized with and encouraged her, and she often paid visits to Scotland. She henceforth wrote many songs in the Scots dialect as well as in the Cumbrian. Among the best of the Scots songs are &#145;What ails this heart o'mine?&#146;; the beautiful, semi-autobiographical &#145;The Siller Croun&#146;; and &#145;The Nabob&#146;, set to the air &#145;The Traveller's Return&#146;. At the end of chapter 66 of <span class="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</span> Charles Dickens quoted the first two lines of &#145;The Siller Croun&#146; a year before Blamire's authorship had been acknowledged by Maxwell in her <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> of 1842. &#145;&#147;Sir&#148; said Dick [Swiveller] &hellip; &#147;we'll make a scholar of the poor Marchioness yet! And she shall walk in silk attire, and siller have to spare, or I may never rise from this bed again!&#148;&#146; Dickens had presumably heard it sung to the haunting tune composed some time after Blamire's death by Sir Henry Rowley Bishop (1786&#150;1855). &#145;The Nabob&#146; is a nostalgic poem with a setting near Duchray Castle that anticipates Robert Burns's &#145;Auld Lang Syne&#146;.<br>
<br>While visiting a relation at Chillingham, in Northumberland, Blamire attracted the attention of Charles Bennet, Lord Ossulston (1743&#150;1822). Maxwell says that Ossulston's father, the third earl of Tankerville, encouraged her to write one of her best sketches of rustic life, a dialogue beginning &#145;Wey, Ned, man! thou luiks sae down-hearted&#146;, a remarkable amalgam of political ferment, involving a political argument that Blamire had overheard between two neighbours on the subject of Thomas Paine's &#145;Reets o'man&#146; of 1791  (Blamire, <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, xxx). While the earl may indeed have been amused by Susanna's compositions in Cumberland dialect, his death in 1767 makes nonsense of the claim that he requested her to compose &#145;Wey, Ned, man!&#146;. Blamire and Ossulston had a love affair that was thwarted when in 1767 Ossulston was sent away to prevent marriage. One of the allegories in <span class="italic">Stoklewath</span>, with its authentic ring of a real lovers' quarrel, points to an angry confrontation some twelve years later between Susanna and Lord Ossulston (now the married fourth earl of Tankerville). This allegory, coupled with the poem &#145;Hope&#146;, a paean to the picturesque, probably set at Painshill Park, suggests that the meeting could have occurred at or near Painshill, only 4 miles distant from the earl's Surrey house at Walton-on-Thames.<br>
<br>While staying in Carlisle, Blamire met William Gilpin's sister, Catherine Gilpin, of Scaleby Castle. They lived together for a while and collaborated on a number of poems including &#145;The Cumberland Scold&#146;&#151;a &#145;perfect masterpiece of dramatic dialect poetry&#146;  (MacDiarmid). They also jointly composed &#145;Peer Body&#146;, a bawdy version of the traditional song &#145;Comin' thro' the Rye&#146;. Blamire herself wrote a number of songs in Cumberland dialect about which the Denwoods enthused:<blockquote>It is all there in a torrent of rich, lively, homely rhymed sense, hitting off character sketches that are truly delightful, and when we remember that they are the first of their kind in Cumbrian dialect our amazement is not lessened. (Denwood and Denwood, 42)</blockquote>Blamire detailed her method of composition in &#145;Epistle to her Friends at Gartmore&#146; (1773), an amusing letter-poem to her Scottish friends Isabella and Elizabeth Graham in which she light-heartedly and cleverly showed the difficulties of writing poetry. This poem was later taken as evidence for Blamire's already being &#145;a very accomplished poet&#146; who had &#145;created for this more personal side of her poetry a free-moving, airy, conversational style, such as no one else is using at this period&#146;  (Wordsworth, 1).<br>
<br>It is sometimes thought from the concluding verses of &#145;Wey, Ned, man!&#146; that Blamire was a reactionary, but this is not borne out in her most powerful poem, &#145;The nun's return to the world, by the decree of the national assembly of France, February 1790&#146;, where she expresses unequivocal support for the principles of the French Revolution and a sympathy for the lot of the unenfranchised labourer. Sections of the poem appear to anticipate Byron's &#145;The Prisoner of Chillon&#146;, especially canto 14. The fact that Blamire's nephew William Brown was Annabella Milbanke's tutor makes it possible that Byron could have read a transcript of the poem while at Seaham Manor, immediately following his marriage to Annabella in 1815.<br>
<br>Blamire, who suffered from debilitating recurrent bouts of rheumatic fever, was also an early female practitioner of orthodox medicine, having learned physic from her brother William. In an unpublished Gothic prose allegory she used desert imagery to describe the pain and malaise of a severe attack of her illness and expressed longing for recovery when, significantly, she would again be able to &#145;dispense blessings to the world as the physician, Counsellor and friend of Mankind&#146;  (Susanna Blamire MSS). Her illness was possibly aggravated by her ministrations to the poor; Blamire, as reflected in her poetry, never lost sight of the grim reality that she had seen at first hand when attending the sick in dark, cramped labourers' cottages. Dr William Paley was a friend of the family, and his philosophy of &#145;moral utilitarianism&#146;&#151;that &#145;virtue is the doing good to mankind in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake of everlasting happiness&#146;  (W. Paley, <span class="italic">Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy</span>, 2 vols., 1787, 1.41)&#151;would certainly have struck a chord with the warmly altruistic Susanna, and probably influenced her own philosophy.<br>
<br>Susanna Blamire died at 14 Finkle Street, Carlisle, on 5 April 1794, of what is now believed to be rheumatic heart disease. She was buried at Raughton Head church, near Dalston, on 9 April. Many regretted the loss of &#145;Miss Sukey's&#146; lively and friendly company at &#145;merry-neets&#146; (late-night social gatherings): &#145;Weel, weel, t'merrie neets wullent be worth gangin' till at aw, noo that she's gean&#146;  (Bullock and Tutor, 21).<br>
<br>Blamire published virtually nothing in her lifetime, and even then anonymously, in magazines and collections such as <span class="italic">Calliope, or, The musical miscelleny</span> (1788) and Johnson's <span class="italic">Scots Musical Museum</span> (1790). &#145;The Chelsea Pensioners&#146; was at first wrongly attributed to Dr James Moor, professor of Greek at the University of Glasgow. Blamire's works were collected for the first time in 1842 by Henry Lonsdale and Patrick Maxwell, who contacted friends and family in search of fragments of her poems, many of which were written on the backs of recipes and letters. Maxwell extolled her as &#145;unquestionably the best female writer of her age&#146;  (Blamire, <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, xxxix). Further unpublished poems were included in Sidney Gilpin's edition of <span class="italic">Songs and Poems by Miss Blamire, together with Songs by her Friend Miss Gilpin</span> (1866).<br>
<br>Hugh MacDiarmid much regretted Blamire's obscurity and praised her Scottish songs, which in their unsentimental, natural sweetness &#145;can be set beside the best that have ever been produced by Scotsmen writing in their own tongue&#146;  (MacDiarmid). For MacDiarmid, Blamire was a &#145;sweet Cumbrian singer whose lyric genius bridged the gulf between Scotland and England, and rang its mirthful or sorrowful changes so effectively in the three different linguistic media of Scots, Cumbrian, and English&#146;  (ibid.). Blamire has also been credited with anticipating the Romantic view expounded by Coleridge and Wordsworth&#151;that the natural world can be influenced by the power of the mind&#151;as early as 1767:<blockquote>
<div>Now grief obscures the cheerful sky<br>
</div>
<div>And clouds the sunbeam of her eye<br>
</div>
<div>So does the black descending storm<br>
</div>
<div>The smiling face of heaven deform.<br>
</div> (&#145;Lament for the Happy Swain&#146;)</blockquote>In her Scots and Cumbrian poems she is understood to have initiated a &#145;new order, a new magic in freedom of rhythm, in sheer spontaneous lyrical beauty&#146;  (Denwood and Denwood, 32).<br>
<br>On 20 March 1994 an inscribed stone in Carlisle Cathedral was dedicated as a bicentennial memorial by Bishop Harland. This coincided with a renewed critical interest in her work. A reprint of her collected poems appeared in 1994. Her biography, <span class="italic">A Passionate Poet: Susanna Blamire, 1747&#150;94</span> by Christopher Maycock, was published by the Hypatia Trust in 2003.<br>
