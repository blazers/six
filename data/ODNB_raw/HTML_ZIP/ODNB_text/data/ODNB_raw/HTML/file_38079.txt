<span class="headword">Turberville, Sir  Thomas  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1295), <span class="occ">soldier and traitor</span>, is of uncertain origins, but his father was probably Sir Hugh de Turberville (<i>d</i>. 1293). It was probably Sir Thomas, not a namesake, who was a follower of John Giffard (<i>d</i>. 1299) in the civil wars of the late 1260s, and who was rewarded for his loyalty to the crown with a grant of land in Northamptonshire. He was probably also the man of that name charged at the Wiltshire eyre of 1280/81 with robbery and homicide. Cleared of the former charge, he refused to plead to the latter, but was eventually cleared when it was found that the killing had been committed during the civil war. There was a strong tradition of royal service in the Turberville family: Hugh de Turberville had served Edward I with distinction since before his accession. Thomas de Turberville was certainly a royal household knight in 1282, when he took part in the Welsh war. In 1286 he accompanied Edward to Paris and on to Gascony. When war broke out between England and France in 1294 he served with a retinue of at least nine knights in John of Brittany's expedition to Gascony. Initial successes were considerable. Turberville was part of the force that occupied Rioms. In April 1295, however, the French seized the town after a riot among the English troops. John of Brittany and much of the garrison fled by ship, but Turberville was captured along with a dozen other knights.<br>
<br>In August, Turberville returned to England, claiming that he had escaped from prison. It was soon discovered that he was in fact spying for the French. A messenger he had employed to take a letter to France revealed its contents to the king. In it Turberville informed the provost of Paris that Wales was now at peace. He reported that the Isle of Wight was not guarded, and that the king was to send a powerful embassy to the German king. Twenty ships were to be sent with grain supplies to Gascony, and an expedition there was to be headed by the earls of Lancaster, Lincoln, and Warwick, along with Hugh Despenser, later earl of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1326). Turberville claimed to have reached agreement with the recently defeated Morgan ap Maredudd that the latter should rebel again if the Scots would follow suit. He advised the French to send a powerful embassy to Scotland. The letter reveals that Turberville's sons had been kept in Paris as hostages, and that he had been promised &pound;100 worth of land as his reward for treachery.<br>
<br>The letter seems genuine. It is reasonably circumstantial, and the description of English plans is very plausible, even though Warwick and Despenser did not sail for Gascony, and no embassy as described went to Germany in 1295. It is inconceivable that Edward would, for propaganda purposes, have falsely implicated one of his own household knights in treason, and in any case he had set a spy upon Turberville, who appears to have tried to flee to Wales.<br>
<br>Turberville was arrested on 24 September 1295, and was tried promptly, on 8 October. The chief justice of the king's bench pronounced the verdict. The guilty man, who was probably the first man in England to be executed for spying, was to be drawn on an oxhide to the gallows, where he was to be hanged; the sentence was executed the same day. News of the event was widely circulated, as a form of war propaganda, and it was also commemorated in a popular song or poem.<br>
