<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Charles, Dame  (Mary) Eugenia</span>  (1919&#150;2005), <span class="occ">prime minister of Dominica</span>, was born on 15 May 1919 at Pointe Michel, near Roseau, on the south-west coast of Dominica, the daughter of John Baptiste Charles (who died in 1983, at the age of 107), businessman, and his wife, Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Delauney. Her father was a successful fruit exporter and the founder of the Dominica Co-operative Bank, a &#145;penny bank&#146; for small savers. She was educated at the Convent High School, Roseau, and St Joseph's Convent, Grenada, and remained a devout Roman Catholic throughout her life. She read law at the University of Toronto and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, London, in 1947. She began private practice in Dominica in 1949. She wrote anonymous articles for <span class="italic">The Herald</span> and later <span class="italic">The Star</span> newspapers that were highly critical of the ruling Dominica Labour Party. She was in the vanguard of those who founded the Dominica Freedom Party in 1968 following demonstrations against the passing of a <span class="roman">Seditious and Undesirable Publications Act</span> in July by the Dominica Labour Party, then under the premiership of Edward Oliver Le Blanc. She failed to win the Roseau North seat in the general election of 1970, contesting it against the future prime minister, Patrick John, but entered the House of Assembly as a nominated member that year.<br>
<br>In the general elections of 1975 Charles contested and won the Roseau Central seat and became leader of opposition in the new parliament. She was a delegate at the constitutional conference held at Marlborough House, London, in 1977, and was an active spokesperson in the public meetings related to the constitution in the run up to independence in November 1978. During political upheavals and a constitutional crisis leading to the resignation of Patrick John in 1979 she served as a member of the Committee for National Salvation that brokered the creation of an interim government under the premiership of the Dominica Labour Party's Oliver Seraphine to administer Dominica until a general election could be organized. She became the first Caribbean woman prime minister when she led the Dominica Freedom Party to victory in the 1980 general election. During this time she was given the nickname Mamo, by which she was popularly known for the rest of her life. Regionally she immediately became part of a formidable team of Caribbean leaders including Edward Seaga of Jamaica and Tom Adams of Barbados, who dominated Caribbean public life in the 1980s.<br>
<br>Charles's first term was dedicated to the reconstruction of housing, roads, and other infrastructure destroyed by Hurricane David, which had hit Dominica on 29 August 1979, and in getting the business of government and foreign relations back into order. This was made more difficult by destabilization and the attempted coups to overthrow her government in 1981 and the court cases that followed. (Patrick John was jailed for twelve years for his part in one such attempted coup, in conjunction with North American white supremacist groups.) Her government was re-elected in 1985 with a reduced majority and again in 1990 when the United Workers' Party, formed in 1988, became the main opposition in parliament.<br>
<br>In 1991 Charles was made a DBE by Elizabeth II at Harare, Zimbabwe, during the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. She retired from the House of Assembly in 1995 and her Dominica Freedom Party lost the general election of that year after fifteen years in power. During that time the country rose to an economic peak in 1988 but the momentum was not maintained and by 1993 there was evidence of the beginning of an economic decline, due mainly to changes in international trade affecting the banana industry, the reduction of foreign aided projects, and the economics of scale in relation to small independent island states. Conflict over her domination of the cabinet and her views on a successor marred the last two years of her leadership. Her firm and forthright character and clear-cut opinions were seen by some to be abrasive and she made many enemies, but her admirers cited these as the only means by which to accomplish results in difficult circumstances. She was best known outside Dominica for her staunch anti-communism during the last years of the cold war in the Caribbean and, as chairman of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, for leading the invitation to the United States government under President Ronald Reagan to invade Grenada in October 1983. For this she was often referred to as the Iron Lady of the Caribbean.<br>
<br>Following her retirement in 1995 Charles watched from the sidelines as the fortunes of the Dominica Freedom Party rapidly declined under new leadership, eventually losing all of its seats in the House of Assembly at the general election of 2005. By then Charles's memory and mental capacity to absorb what was going on around her were fading and in the opinion of those close to her she had lost the will to live by the time she fell and fractured her left hip on 27 August 2005. She was flown to Martinique for treatment, but died of a pulmonary embolism in Fort de France, Martinique, on 6 September. She was buried in Pointe Michel on 14 September, after a funeral service at La Sallette Roman Catholic church. She never married and had no children. Her death removed another of the core group of regional leaders, including Tom Adams of Barbados, Sir John Compton of St Lucia, Sir Vere Cornwall Bird of Antigua, and Sir James Mitchell of St Vincent and the Grenadines, who dominated the politics of the eastern Caribbean during the latter part of the twentieth century, when the islands attained independence from Britain.<br>
