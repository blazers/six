<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Paul</span>  (1534&#150;1594), <span class="occ">member of parliament</span>, was the third son of Sir Nicholas Wentworth of Lillingstone Lovell, Oxfordshire, and Jane Josselyn. In 1563 he married Helen Tildesley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Agmondesham, of Heston, Middlesex; they had four sons and four daughters. Together with his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29051/', "Peter Wentworth")</script>, Paul was frequently at odds with Queen Elizabeth over policy and questions of parliamentary privilege. He sat in three parliaments, consisting of five sessions: for Chipping Wycombe (1559), Buckingham (1563), and Liskeard (1572). Wentworth was identified in 1564 as being earnest in religion, and his puritan leanings came to the fore in the third session of the 1572 parliament when he moved &#145;for a publique fast to the end that it might please God to blesse us in our actions better then we had beene heretofore, and for a sermon to be had every morning&#146;  (Hartley, 1.526). The house debated the matter and Wentworth's motion passed rather narrowly. However, three days later the speaker reported that the queen strongly objected to their decision, because she had prohibited them from discussing religious matters. Vice-chamberlain Sir Christopher Hatton added that although the queen liked fasting, prayer, and sermons, on no account did the Commons have the right to order a public fast; this rested solely in her royal prerogative. Speaker John Popham was rebuked for allowing the house to be divided on the matter, Wentworth having failed to make a legislative proposal. The Commons apologized, pleading that they had not acted out of malice but lack of proper consideration.<br>
<br>Wentworth was not one to mince words in his speeches. During a long debate on Mary, queen of Scots, in 1572, a diarist recorded Wentworth's contribution as follows: &#145;Wisheth it may be put to the question of the Howse whither wee should call for an axe or an acte&#146;  (Hartley, 1.376). However important might be regarded these later contributions to the history of Elizabeth's parliaments, there is no doubt that Wentworth's key intervention came early in his parliamentary career. In 1566, the second session of the 1563 parliament, the Commons was much preoccupied with the related questions of the queen's marriage and the succession. On Saturday 9 November, just over a week into the session, the queen ordered all discussion to cease on the matter. On the following Monday Wentworth rose to ask three questions: first, &#145;Whether hyr Hyghnes' commawndment, forbyddyng the lower howse to speake or treate any more of the successyon and of any theyre excuesses in that behalffe, be a breache of the lybertie of the free speache of the Howse or not?&#146; Second, whether her ministers, in pronouncing her commandment to the house in her name &#145;are of awthorytye suffycyent to bynde the Howse to scylence in that behalffe, or to bynde the Howse to acknoledge the same to be a direct and sufficient commawndment or not?&#146; And, last, whether her commandment &#145;be no breache of the lybertie of the Howse&#146; or sufficient &#145;to bynde the Howse to take knoledge theroff, then what offence is it for anye of the Howse to err in declaryng his opynyon to be otherwyse?&#146;  (Hartley, 1.154). A later reader of the questions endorsed them as concerning &#145;the liberty of the Hows in freedom of speech for succession&#146;  (ibid.), and this is how most historians since have regarded them, most notably Sir John Neale. However, in the 1980s Sir Geoffrey Elton, among others, challenged the importance placed on the questions. Although they were much debated on the day, Elton suggested that, significantly, Wentworth's questions were left unanswered, and MPs quickly let the matter drop in their haste to turn to the major business of a parliament, legislation. Their interest may well lie, as one of Wentworth's biographers remarked, &#145;in the context of the centuries-long debate on freedom of speech in the Commons&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 3.596) rather than in their significance for the history of the 1566 parliamentary session. Nevertheless, given the number of draft speeches and notes on the subject, there is little doubt that members were gravely concerned with the matter of the succession and the queen's marriage, the substantive issues which gave rise to Wentworth's questions in the first place.<br>
<br>Unlike his brother, none of Wentworth's parliamentary activities seems to have caused the queen to take action against him. In 1569 Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, was lodged at Wentworth's manor of Burnham, Buckinghamshire, before entering the Tower. Wentworth had secured the lease of Burnham through his marriage, his wife being widow to a groom of the chamber, William Tildesley, who was the first lessee of Burnham Abbey after its dissolution. In 1589 the queen, noting Wentworth's dutiful service, especially with regards to Norfolk, granted him an extended renewal of his lease. Wentworth was active in searching for Catholics in Oxford and Buckinghamshire and his will, drawn up in September 1593, bears the full flavour of an English puritan. He died on 13 January 1594, leaving his widow as sole executor. He was buried at Burnham, where the inscription in the church declared that he lived &#145;most Christian-like&#146; and died &#145;most comfortably strong in faith, steadfast in hope, fervent in love, a zealous professor of the truth, and an earnest detester of all superstition&#146;.<br>
