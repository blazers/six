<span class="headword">Moore, Sir  Leopold Frank</span>  (1868&#150;1945), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician in Northern Rhodesia</span>, was born on 26 February 1868 at 25 Healey Street, Kentish Town, London, the son of Benjamin Moore, commercial traveller, and his wife, Fanny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> May. He was educated at Wyggeston School, Leicester, and, after qualifying as a pharmacist in London, moved to Cape Town in 1892, and to Mafeking the following year. On 9 August 1894 he married (Katherine) Maud Tait, daughter of Alfred Tait, of Bulawayo; there were no children of the marriage. By 1898 he had set up a pharmacy in Bulawayo and soon displayed a talent for political agitation, campaigning against the chartered British South Africa Company's plan to import Chinese labour for the mines. By 1903 his business was bankrupt; he claimed that this was the result of a boycott organized by the chartered company. In 1904 he moved to the Old Drift, a malarial settlement on the north bank of the Zambezi near the Victoria Falls, in what was then North-Western Rhodesia (and became Northern Rhodesia in 1911). After the building of the Victoria Falls Bridge had rendered the Old Drift redundant, he reluctantly transferred his pharmacy&#151;a corrugated iron shed&#151;to the new town of Livingstone, which was established on the healthier sand belt about 6 miles away in 1905. His first journalistic venture was the <span class="italic">Livingstone Pioneer</span>, which he launched in January 1906, but he differed with his partner in that venture and set up the <span class="italic">Livingstone Mail</span> in competition with it in March 1906. The <span class="italic">Pioneer</span> lasted just over six months, but the <span class="italic">Mail</span> lasted for almost sixty years.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Livingstone Mail</span> was Moore's most remarkable achievement. It took great energy and perseverance, and some literary ability, to produce a readable weekly newspaper in frontier conditions for nearly four decades. In later years he employed editors, but for much of the time he relied on the assistance of his remarkable wife, who acted as editor and manager during his lengthy absences overseas on political business. Moore not only contributed leading articles and news reports, but also short stories.<br>
<br>Moore was an autodidact with an understandable contempt for the products of Oxford and Cambridge. His characteristic political position was one of opposition to the government, but his politics were populist and difficult to pin down. Described by Stewart Gore-Browne as &#145;old Moore, the Bolshevik chemist&#146;  (Rotberg, 178), he was closer to anarchism and socialism than to liberalism, conservatism, or fascism, but was a staunch libertarian. He may not have been an atheist but he was certainly anti-clerical and anti-missionary. Members of Livingstone's Jewish community thought that he was of Jewish descent but they resented his opposition to Zionism and to the immigration of German Jewish refugees in the 1930s. Although he defended the reservation of jobs for white labour, and rejected the idea of &#145;native paramountcy&#146; for territories north of the Zambezi, his paper was usually free of colonial racism. He showed some sympathy for African interests, education, health, and welfare, and published material by missionaries and others on African history and culture, as well as letters from African correspondents from an early date. His opposition to, and alleged libels of, the Belgian administration in the Congo resulted in his detention in prison in Elisabethville for two weeks in 1913. He and his paper were brought close to bankruptcy by a successful action for criminal libel which was brought against him by Northern Rhodesia's chief veterinary officer, John Smith, in 1924.<br>
<br>For the first twenty years of his political life, which was more or less inseparable from his journalistic life, Moore's main motivation was passionate opposition to the British South Africa Company. He never tired of pointing to the &#145;paradox of a company of financial adventurers out for gain&#151;and gain on a large scale&#151;being allowed not only to exploit the natives of a territory, legally the wards of the British Crown, but British subjects as well&#146;  (Denny, pt 2, p. 336). He questioned the land rights of the company and asserted that the colonists of Northern Rhodesia &#145;will have to make up their minds whether they are to become the serfs and retainers of a modern capitalistic feudalism or whether they will maintain the freedom and independence of their race&#146;  (Denny, pt 1, p. 227). He opposed municipal rates, stamp duties, and income tax&#151;with the slogan &#145;no taxation without representation&#146;. He was elected to the advisory council, which was set up in 1918, but soon resigned from it in protest against an emergency proclamation allowing for detention without trial, and against the administrator's edict that the council could not discuss &#145;politics&#146;. After the end of chartered company rule and the transfer of Northern Rhodesia to the Colonial Office in 1924 he became first a nominated member of the legislative council and then, from 1926, leader of the elected or unofficial members.<br>
<br>Moore had a strong claim to be Northern Rhodesia's first nationalist, and was in his own eccentric and cantankerous way a democrat and a libertarian. He was one of the first people to think of Northern Rhodesia as a separate and viable country, suggesting a distinctive name for it, Zambezia, in 1924. For most of his political career he was an opponent of plans for the incorporation of the territory in a wider Union of South Africa or a Central African Federation, or for its amalgamation with Southern Rhodesia. It was only in the mid-1930s, in the wake of the depression, and after his failure to stop the transfer of the capital from his beloved Livingstone to Lusaka, which he portrayed as cold, dusty, and windswept, that he became an advocate of amalgamation. He attended the coronation of George VI in 1937 as one of two representatives of the Northern Rhodesian settlers, and was knighted the same year. It was as a result of his pressure for amalgamation at that time, and that of Godfrey Huggins, prime minister of Southern Rhodesia, that the Bledisloe commission on closer union was set up. He resigned from the legislative council in 1939 in protest against the failure of this commission to back amalgamation. He was re-elected unopposed at a by-election, but lost his position as leader of the unofficial members to Gore-Browne. He lost his council seat to a member of Roy Welensky's newly formed Labour Party in 1941. A most unusual knight of the realm, he was for nearly forty years Northern Rhodesia's most conspicuous white settler, and a thorn in the side of, successively, the British South Africa Company and the Colonial Office. He died in Livingstone on 15 May 1945, and was given a masonic funeral.<br>
