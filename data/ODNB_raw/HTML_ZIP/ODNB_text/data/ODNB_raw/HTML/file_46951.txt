<span class="headword">Mercer,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1300&#150;1380), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of Thomas Mercer of Perth, and became the most prominent Scottish merchant of his day. The Mercers were closely associated with Perth, and John held several properties there and served as alderman. Nevertheless, little is known of his early career, and he must have been well advanced in years when he rose to national prominence in David II's service, perhaps coming to royal attention as a burgh representative negotiating the king's ransom in 1357. He represented Perth at a general council in 1365 and in parliament in 1370, and from 1359 to 1380 he was custumar of the town. In 1359&#150;62 and 1374&#150;7 he was in charge of arrangements for paying the ransom of David II, raised through the wool customs and collected in Flanders. He was later special deputy of the chamberlain (1364), receiver of the king's money (1376&#150;7), and auditor of the sheriffs' accounts (1374). Mercer undertook diplomatic missions to Flanders in 1367 and to England in 1379. He was said to be in great favour with the king of France; this may have been true, but the John Mercer who was the French king's councillor in 1384 was probably a relative, perhaps his son.<br>
<br>Throughout his life John Mercer continued his mercantile activities, trading in England, Flanders, and France, often in partnership with his son Andrew. In a celebrated incident which brought him to the attention of English chroniclers he was shipwrecked during a voyage off the English coast in 1376 and was imprisoned by the earl of Northumberland. The earl of Douglas, Mercer's patron, protested to Edward III, and Mercer was freed, much to the regret of Thomas Walsingham, who believed that if he had been ransomed &#145;he would have enriched both the king and the kingdom by his vast wealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 1.369). Mercer deducted 2000 merks from the royal ransom payments to compensate for his losses. His son Andrew took more drastic action and in 1378 raised a fleet of Spanish, French, and Scottish ships that attacked and plundered ships at Scarborough. In response the London merchant John Philipot (<i>d</i>. 1384) assembled his own fleet and captured Andrew and his booty. Andrew was released later that year. According to family tradition, an engraved cup commemorates this event, although the cup itself is probably later in date. Thomas Mercer, archdeacon of Glasgow and perhaps another son of John's, was imprisoned in England when returning from an embassy to France; the date is uncertain, but he was released under safe conduct in October 1379.<br>
<br>John Mercer died in 1380, and was buried in St John's Church, Perth. A probably inaccurate tradition maintains that the family traded their mills on the north and south inches of Perth for the right of burial in the church:<blockquote>
<div>Folk say the Mercers tried the town to cheat,<br>
</div>
<div>When for two Inches they did win two feet.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Our Seven Centuries</span>, 6)</blockquote>During his career Mercer amassed substantial holdings in Perth and Perthshire, including Lyndoch, Tullybeagle, Meikle Kinnaird, Pettland, and Meikleour, and his marriage to Ada Murray of Tullibardine, Perthshire, <i>c</i>.1327, brought Aldie in Kinross-shire to the family. Their son Sir Andrew Mercer (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1389) married Jonet, kinswoman of Margaret Berclay, the wife of Robert II's son Walter, thereby establishing ties of kinship to the royal family; his standing is shown by his acting as arbitrator in a lawsuit between John Logie, David II's stepson, and Robert Stewart, earl of Fife, Robert II's second son, in 1385. Among John's other sons may have been the Robert Mercer whose family became lairds of Innerpeffray in Strathearn, and John Mercer, canon of Dunkeld, whose petition for a papal dispensation in 1372 was supported by the kings of both Scotland and France. Thomas Walsingham described Mercer as &#145;skilful in matters relating to commerce, and fertile in expedient and prudent in counsel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 1.369). He represents the growing prominence of medieval merchants, who, through their financial importance to the crown, were able to exert increasing influence on national affairs, and to ensure the upward social mobility of their families.<br>
