<span class="headword">Smyth,  Edward</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1764&#150;1790), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was son of the Revd John Smyth (1697&#150;1781) of co. Limerick, chancellor of Conor, and Anne Drysdale (<i>c</i>.1706&#150;1777). His uncle was the archbishop of Dublin, F. A. Smyth. Educated at the University of Glasgow between 1764 and 1770, Smyth was ordained in 1770, which was also the year of his marriage to fifteen-year-old Agnes Higginson, who had been born in Lisburn, the daughter of William Higginson [<a name="cosubject_59934"></a><span class="headword">Agnes Smyth <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Higginson]</span></span>  (1754/5&#150;1783)]. The couple had five children, three of whom died in childhood. In 1773, disappointed in his hopes of inheriting wealth from his uncle, Edward Smyth took up a curacy in Ballyculter, co. Down. Two years later, following Agnes's introduction to Methodism, he too adopted a much more evangelical approach to religion, attracting large crowds and stimulating revivalist fervour when he preached in local barns. Agnes Smyth, who proved an important influence on her husband's spiritual life, was noted at this time for her &#145;excessive zeal&#146;, disapproving of all frivolous behaviour, adopting plain dress, and, when the opportunity came her way, preaching and leading prayers and hymn singing. Edward Smyth's newly discovered zeal was not, however, appreciated by his patron, Lord Bangor. When the curate publicly admonished Bangor for adultery, he responded by accusing Smyth of erroneous teaching. Smyth was brought to trial in the consistory court of Down, and although the case against him was eventually dismissed, Bishop Trail deprived him of his living in December 1776, and his licence was revoked in 1777.<br>
<br>John Wesley, impressed by Smyth's vigorous and effective preaching, appointed him as a &#145;general missionary&#146;, and when he moved to Bath in 1779 because of his wife's ill health invited him to preach at the chapel there on Sunday evenings. Smyth returned to Ireland for a brief spell and then, in 1782, served as one of Wesley's curates in London. Smyth appears to have been greatly affected by the piety and religious ardour of his wife, Agnes, and her death at Bath on 22 May 1783 must have been a considerable blow. He later married a Miss Dawson, though further details are unknown.<br>
<br>In 1783 Smyth settled in Dublin, where a year later his brother William, a wealthy layman, began the building of the Bethesda Chapel on Dorset Street. At this stage Smyth withdrew from the Methodist itinerancy&#151;his relationship with the connection always somewhat uneasy. In 1778 he had advocated the immediate separation of Methodists from the Church of Ireland, while in Bath his presence caused tensions with the conference appointee, Alexander McNab, resulting in division within the society and McNab's temporary withdrawal. When he was appointed co-chaplain (with John Walker) of Bethesda in 1786 a substantial number of wealthy Dublin Methodists left the local society to join the new congregation. Wesley was aware of the power of Smyth's preaching, referring to him as &#145;a son of thunder&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 7.209), and he himself preached at Bethesda on several occasions. He was also aware of Smyth's propensity for conflict, however, writing to his brother Charles, &#145;I doubt Edward &#147;needs a bridle&#148;; but who can put the bit into his mouth?&#146;  (ibid., 7.324).<br>
<br>Smyth was the author of several religious pamphlets, including a vigorous defence of his actions at Ballyculter, <span class="italic">An Account of the Trial of Edward Smyth</span> (1777), and while at Bethesda he also compiled a hymnbook and a prayer book revision. By 1790, however, Wesley was noting a decline in Smyth's popularity, and he subsequently moved to Manchester, where he became curate of St Clement's and St Luke's, after which no further information is known of his life. Edward Smyth's zealous evangelicalism, interpreted by some as spiritual arrogance, had the power both to alienate and attract. The daughter of his first public opponent, the Hon. Sophia Ward of Bangor, was an early convert, and despite Lord Bangor's wholehearted opposition subsequently bequeathed virtually her whole estate to religious and charitable organizations. The Bethesda Chapel, to which he introduced a Wesleyan element, was to become an important focus of evangelical activity in Dublin. Smyth's religious career reflects some of the tensions both within early Methodism and between the connection and the Church of Ireland, and demonstrates the potential of early evangelical activity for both progress and disruption.<br>
