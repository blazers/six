<span class="headword">Bourne,  Gilbert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1569), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells</span>, the son of Philip Bourne of Worcestershire, was born <i>c</i>.1510 (Foxe reports that Bourne was aged about forty-one in 1551). Having entered Oxford University in 1524, he graduated BA in 1528, became a fellow of All Souls College in 1531, and proceeded MA in 1533. Four years later, in February 1537, he was &#145;dispensed to take all holy orders outside statutory times and two on [the] same day&#146;  (Emden, <span class="italic">Oxf.</span>, 4.62). He then completed his studies in 1543 when he received the degree of bachelor of theology, also from Oxford.<br>
<br>Between 1541 and 1551 Bourne was given a number of preferments. In 1541 he became rector of Duntisbourne Abbots, Gloucestershire; in 1542, he was made prebendary of the fifth stall of the king's new foundation at Worcester; about 1543 he became chaplain to Edmund Bonner, bishop of London; in 1545 he obtained the prebends of Holborn and Wildland, both at St Paul's, London; in 1547 he was proctor for the clergy of the diocese of London; in 1548 he exchanged the prebend of Wildland for that of Brownswood, also at St Paul's; in 1549 he was made archdeacon of Bedford; in 1550 he became rector of High Ongar, Essex; some time before April 1550 he was vicar of Arlingham, Gloucestershire; and in 1551 he was given the rectory of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Because he received and maintained so many preferments during such a period of religious turmoil, Bourne must have agreed with or, at the very least, not openly resisted the changes in religion that occurred during that time. As chaplain to Bonner, however, he remained loyal to his superior during Bonner's troubles with the Edwardian government.<br>
<br>On 13 August 1553, less than a month after Mary I's accession, Bourne was almost killed when he preached a sermon at Paul's Cross, denouncing the protestant changes of Edward VI's reign, and singing the praises of Bonner, deprived of the bishopric of London in 1549, but soon to be restored. The crowd that gathered to hear Bourne's sermon became so angry with his remarks that they began to riot, and someone threw a dagger at Bourne that narrowly missed its target.<br>
<br>Probably through the influence of his uncle, Sir John Bourne, who was principal secretary of state during Mary's reign, Bourne was made bishop of Bath and Wells by papal provision, being consecrated on 1 April 1554. The temporalities were restored on 20 April, and he received papal confirmation on 6 July of that same year.<br>
<br>Little can be said of Bourne's secular administration of his diocese, but he did recover the valuable manor of Banwell, lost under Edward VI, albeit at the cost of a reserved rent of &pound;115 per annum. Inevitably religious issues dominated his episcopate, which saw the diocesan clergy deprived of at least 106 benefices&#151;a ratio of one deprivation for every six benefices. The exact cause for many of these deprivations cannot be determined, but in most cases it was probably because the incumbent had married during the Edwardian period when clergy were permitted to do so&#151;something that the Marian religious injunctions of 1554 undid. As for heresy cases, the surviving evidence indicates that Bourne condemned two men, Roger Hues (or Curryer) and Richard Lush, but that only Hues went to the stake. Lush, who was condemned on 5 November 1558, in part for saying that Hues was unjustly executed, must have been spared a fiery end by Mary's death less than a fortnight later.<br>
<br>Outside his diocese Bourne was a member of the commissions that in 1555 examined the martyrs Thomas Tomkins and John Philpot, and (before he became a bishop) he may have been the Dr Bourne who attempted to persuade Walter Mantel to recant. Perhaps for his loyal service to the Marian government, or through the continued influence of his uncle, Bourne was appointed president of the council in the marches of Wales on 29 October 1558, and held this position until February 1559.<br>
<br>After Elizabeth I's accession Bourne refused to take the oath of supremacy, and was subsequently deprived some time between 18 October 1559 and 11 January 1560&#151;by the middle of November Cecil was proposing Berkeley as his successor. Bourne was sent to the Tower of London on 18 June 1560. His fortunes thereafter are not always clear. In 1561 he was released into the custody of Nicholas Bullingham, bishop of Lincoln, but a letter of June 1562 to the privy council from the lieutenant of the Tower may show that Bourne was then back in the latter's keeping. If so, he was returned to Bullingham in 1563, following an outbreak of plague in London, and seems to have remained in his care until at least the end of 1565, when Bullingham asked to be relieved of his prisoner. Bourne was then handed over to George Carew, archdeacon of Exeter (who was also the dean of Bristol and of St George's Chapel, Windsor), and probably remained in Carew's keeping until his death at Silverton, Devon, on 10 September 1569. Bourne was buried in Silverton church on the south side of the altar, having bequeathed what possessions he had to his brother Richard.<br>
