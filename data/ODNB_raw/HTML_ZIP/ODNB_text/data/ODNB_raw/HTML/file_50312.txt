<span class="headword">Macfarlane,  Donald</span>  (1834&#150;1926), <span class="occ">Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at Vallay, North Uist, the fourth of the six children of Donald Macfarlane, a manager of farms on the estate of Colonel Gordon of Cluny, Aberdeenshire, the proprietor of South Uist and Barra. His mother was Elizabeth Macdonald, daughter of Alexander Macdonald, Trotternish, Skye.<br>
<br>Macfarlane's early education was at parish schools in South Uist. In 1850 he attended a school at Uiskeva, Benbecula, which had been set up through the efforts of the Ladies' Society for the Religious Improvement of the Remote Highlands and Islands. Its first teacher was Donald Macdonald, afterwards Free Church minister of Shieldaig, who became a lifelong friend of Macfarlane's. In October 1856 a change occurred which altered the whole course of Macfarlane's life, when he was called to the Christian ministry through the preaching of Alexander MacColl of Duirinish, Skye, and afterwards of Lochalsh.<br>
<br>In order to raise sufficient funds to start a university course Macfarlane taught for the next seven years in three Hebridean schools. He began his college course at Glasgow University in 1863, and completed his divinity course in 1873. He studied under two distinguished professors, William Ramsay and Edmund Law Lushington. Under Lushington he made a special study of Greek. His theology course was at Glasgow Free Church College, where the principal was Patrick Fairbairn.<br>
<br>The spiritual and theological decline of the Free Church in the fifty years after the Disruption accelerated during the ten-year union controversy that coincided with Macfarlane's period in Glasgow. The controversy was stirred by the attempts at effecting a union between the Free Church and the United Presbyterian church. The United Presbyterians were voluntaries and were willing to tolerate an Amyraldian view of the atonement&#151;essentially, that Christ died for all. The negotiations polarized the Free Church into two parties and divided every presbytery. Macfarlane supported the anti-unionists, led by James Begg, and his acquaintance with theological compromise during these years left its impress on the rest of his career.<br>
<br>The presbytery of Skye and Uist licensed Macfarlane on 24 June 1874 at Snizort. While still a probationer at Dunoon he met John Kennedy of Dingwall, who recommended the elders of the congregation of Strathconan, Ross-shire, to call him as their minister. He was ordained and inducted at Strathconan on 20 January 1876. Three years later he received a call to Moy, Inverness-shire. While there he married Mary Morrison (<i>d</i>. 1928), the eldest daughter of Alexander Morrison, Sollas, North Uist. Horatius Bonar conducted the ceremony on 14 April 1880 at the Windsor Hotel, Princes Street, Edinburgh. They had no children. In 1888 Macfarlane accepted a call to Kilmallie in the Free Church Presbytery of Abertarff.<br>
<br>In the last quarter of the nineteenth century worldwide Presbyterianism was loosening its attachment to Calvinism and to the Westminster confession of faith. The United Presbyterian church passed a declaratory act in 1879, whose purpose was to declare or explain the confession, a dilution of the church's commitment to Calvinism. Presbyterian churches throughout the world soon followed the United Presbyterians' lead. The Free Church of Scotland set up a committee in 1889 to report on ways of &#145;providing relief&#146; for those who could not give unqualified subscription to the Westminster confession. Two years later a declaratory act was approved by the general assembly, which became church law in 1892.<br>
<br>Before the declaratory act was passed, opposition to it had been organized by the constitutional party in the Free Church&#151;a grouping with which Macfarlane was associated. In January 1893 Macfarlane's presbytery of Abertarff engrossed in its records a protest against the general assembly's action in approving the <span class="roman">declaratory act</span>. A week later, on 25 January 1893, Macfarlane's own kirk session placed a similar protest in its minutes. During the resulting turmoil Macfarlane was translated from Kilmallie to Raasay. The induction was on 25 April 1893 and he took office under a protest against the declaratory act.<br>
<br>The general assembly of the Free Church of Scotland of 1893 was the jubilee of the Disruption. Most major Presbyterian churches in the world sent delegates to the gathering. On 25 May the commissioners dealt with the overtures for the repeal of the <span class="roman">declaratory act</span>. When, through the influence of Principal Robert Rainy, the assembly refused to repeal the act, Macfarlane advanced to the clerk's table and laid on it a protest. This action led to the formation of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Macfarlane was joined by his friend Donald Macdonald (the only minister to stand with him), a group of students led by Neil Cameron, and a large number of elders and lay people, mainly in the Scottish highlands. The new church's first presbytery met on 28 July 1893, and on 14 August 1893 the presbytery adopted a deed of separation from the Free Church.<br>
<br>Macfarlane became the first Free Presbyterian minister of Raasay. Initially the landowner refused to grant a site for either a church or a manse. For five years Macfarlane lived in a rented house in Broadford on Skye and crossed to Raasay by boat every weekend. In 1903 he was translated to Dingwall, where he continued his ministry for a further twenty-three years. Macfarlane, together with Neil Cameron, guided the Free Presbyterian church for the first thirty years of its existence. Both vigorously opposed attempts, in 1905 and 1918, to unite the Free Presbyterian church with the section of the Free Church that refused to enter the 1900 union of the majority Free Church with the United Presbyterian church.<br>
<br>Donald Macfarlane believed the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to be the inerrant word of God. His sermons were noted for their remarkable clearness and simplicity. His published works include <span class="italic">Memoir and Remains of the Rev. Donald Macdonald: Shieldaig</span> (1903), <span class="italic">Sermons on the Love of God and Cognate Themes</span> (1918), and several pamphlets. He died at Dingwall on 4 November 1926 and was buried in the cemetery there on 9 November.<br>
