<span class="headword">Harcourt <span class="st"> [ de Harcourt]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1050&#150;1330), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, a family of major importance in the central midlands, was first to be found in Normandy before 1066 where sources deriving from the abbey of Bec-Hellouin identify one Anschetil as lord of Harcourt (Eure) and as a close cousin of the magnate family known as the Beaumonts, lords of Beaumont-le-Roger and Pont-Audemer. His son <a name="cosubject_59020"></a><span class="headword">Robert fitz Anschetil</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1118)<span class="occ"></span> held a large barony from the Beaumonts. The creation of the earldom of Warwick for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19984/', "Henry de Beaumont")</script> in 1088 brought Robert an estate of seven fees in Leicestershire and Warwickshire formerly held in chief by Robert de Vescy but subordinated to the earldom. The Harcourts secured a number of other estates in the same counties when Henry I created the earldom of Leicester for Robert de Beaumont, count of Meulan (<i>d</i>. 1118), in 1107, including Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, which became the Harcourt centre in England in the twelfth century. Robert fitz Anschetil had died by 1118 to be succeeded by numerous sons, at least four of whom took shares of his cross-channel estates. The son who founded the chief English branch of the family was <a name="cosubject_59021"></a><span class="headword">Ivo  de Harcourt</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1166)<span class="occ"></span> who acquired most of the Harcourt lands in England perhaps in succession (at least in the earldom of Warwick) to his elder, childless brother, Anschetil fitz Robert, who died soon after 1130. Ivo was a major follower of Robert (II), earl of Leicester. He is found frequently in the Leicester household, and accompanied his lord to Normandy in 1154. Perhaps to simplify the problems posed by the split allegiance, Roger, earl of Warwick, transferred to Earl Robert three and a half Harcourt fees in exchange for an equal number of Leicester fees in Warwickshire, in a singular arrangement transacted before 1153. Ivo was still alive in 1166, but probably died not long afterwards.<br>
<br>Ivo was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_59022"></a><span class="headword">Robert  de Harcourt</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1205)<span class="occ"></span>. Robert attested a late charter of Robert (II) of Leicester, and although he acted as a pledge for Earl Robert (III) in a debt to Aaron the Jew before 1179, he seems largely to have separated himself from the Leicester family after 1168. He was an independent figure in the midlands, his concerns centred on estate improvement and enlargement. He promoted the status of his house at Market Bosworth by the building of a substantial private chapel, which involved him in litigation with Bertram de Verdon, patron of the parish church of the place. In the reign of Henry II, before 1184, he made a profitable marriage to Isabel, daughter of Richard (I) de Camville, obtaining in 1192 the substantial marriage portion of Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, and Norton and Stratton in the soke of Rothley, valued at &pound;56 rent p.a. Between 1198 and 1202 he was sheriff of Leicestershire and Warwickshire, and left a debt of &pound;127 3<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. which was still outstanding on his death <i>c</i>.1205.<br>
<br>Robert left several sons, but the bulk of his estates came to his eldest, <a name="cosubject_59023"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [i]  de Harcourt</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1223)<span class="occ"></span>, who was active in King Richard's wars in France, doing service for his father for the fee of Stanton Harcourt in 1197. He was also active on King John's behalf in the campaigns of 1215 and campaigned in 1220&#150;21 for the regents of Henry III against the count of Aumale's rebellion and John's former sheriffs. The exchequer memoranda have him alive in the year Easter 1222&#150;3 but there is reference to the executors of his testament in a fine of April 1223. His son answered for his considerable debts (over &pound;400) in 1224. As with his father, William seems not to have had any magnate links, but rather to have formed a connection with the king direct and entered the group of minor curial magnates: the scale of his debts indicates that his finances may not have equalled his aspirations.<br>
<br>William was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_59024"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard [i]  de Harcourt</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1258)<span class="occ"></span>. Richard made a third substantial acquisition for his family in the Staffordshire manor of Ellenhall, which came to him through marriage to Orabilia, daughter of Thomas Noel. He made careful arrangements for the succession to his lands, enfeoffing his younger son, Saher, with two Leicestershire manors, Kibworth and Newton Harcourt, in his own lifetime. He died early in 1258 leaving his brother, William, rector of Aylestone, as his executor, as appears from a later fine. His eldest son, <a name="cosubject_59025"></a><span class="headword">Sir William [ii]  de Harcourt</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1270)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded to the bulk of his estate, doing homage to the king for his manor of Stanton in April 1258. William [ii] made two marriages, the first (before 1253) to Alice, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30300/', "Alan de la Zouche")</script>, which brought him the manor of Tong, Shropshire, and Braunstone, Leicestershire, from his father. The second marriage was to a certain Hilaria. This William became involved with the Montfortian cause in 1264&#150;5, although there is little evidence to link him with the Montfort affinity in the midlands before then. His brother Sir Saher was, however, a long-term associate of Earl Simon, and was ruined by his involvement with the baronial cause. William [ii] was burdened with fines of 500 marks, but in 1267 found a group of neighbours and relatives able to guarantee and clear 400 marks, which the king had granted to Sir Philip Basset, and in 1269 negotiated the clearing of a further 100 marks owed to William de Valence. William died in 1270, leaving his only son, <a name="cosubject_59026"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard [ii]  de Harcourt</span>  (1256&#150;1293)<span class="occ"></span>, a minor, as heir. Richard had proof of age in 1277, when his date of birth was agreed as having been 9 December 1256 in Oxfordshire (presumably at Stanton), which would have made him the son of William's first marriage. Richard was already married at that time to Margery Bek of Eresby. Sir Richard died early in 1293 leaving as heir his son <a name="cosubject_59027"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Harcourt</span>  (1274&#150;1330)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>The successive heads of the Harcourt family after the 1160s were men of national significance, and although they clearly found their minor magnate status a financial burden, did not enter into any alliance with the greater magnates. The Harcourts successfully maintained and augmented their already substantial demesne interests in three midland counties throughout the thirteenth century, largely by advantageous marriages, which must be a tribute to their court connections and lineage. Their arms were two bars (seal of Richard [i], <i>c</i>.1223) and later or, two bars gules (William [ii], <i>c</i>.1285, St George's roll).<br>
