<span class="headword">Oxtoby,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Praying Johnny]</span>  (1767&#150;1830), <span class="occ">evangelist and Primitive Methodist preacher</span>, was born early in 1767 at Little Givendale, near Pocklington, East Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Robert Oxtoby, a farmer, and his wife, Jane. He received a little education at a country school, worked in agriculture, but lost carefully acquired property by &#145;placing it in faithless hands&#146;  (Leigh, 9). He led &#145;a sober, steady and respectable life&#146; and &#145;was a most regular and consistent church goer&#146; (Shaw, 10, correcting Leigh, 9). In 1804 he came under a painful conviction of sin from which he was delivered by a Methodist preacher's sermon on &#145;Saving faith&#146;. He immediately went from house to house telling of his conversion, acquired the sobriquet Praying Johnny, and at Warter village gave &pound;10 towards building a chapel.<br>
<br>Oxtoby always dressed plainly, and was unremarkable in appearance, but his voice was &#145;clear, strong, musical, and agreeable&#146;  (Leigh, 11), though with a strong East Yorkshire accent. His ministry from 1804 to 1818, during which he worked for a time as a farmer and engaged in evangelism with the Wesleyan Methodists, is poorly recorded.<br>
<br>In 1818 Oxtoby worked alongside the preacher George Nicholson in a remarkable religious revival in villages of north Lincolnshire, where once, when Nicholson's sermon would not &#145;go&#146;, Johnny's personal testimony was instantly effective. They then successfully evangelized villages to the west of Hull, where, on 5 January 1819, Oxtoby was among those who welcomed the gifted Primitive Methodist preacher William Clowes. Oxtoby was impressed with Clowes's faith and fruitful ministry, and worked for a time as his assistant. He identified strongly with the Primitive Methodists, whose cause had flourished since their foundational camp meeting at Mow Cop (1807), and was placed on their preaching &#145;plan&#146;.<br>
<br>Oxtoby's diary, quoted at length by his biographers, makes clear his expectations and reception. At his home prayer meetings, his love feasts, his open-air preaching, he looked for unbelievers to be converted (&#145;set free&#146;), and (following John Wesley) for believers to experience &#145;entire sanctification&#146;. To this end he spent hours in prayer. At Beverley in 1824 he spent &#145;as much as six hours at a time praying and holding intercourse with God under a tree in Mr J. Jenkinson's garden&#146;  (Shaw, 96). According to a member at Halifax he &#145;generally spent about six hours a day upon his knees&#146; and &#145;sometimes devoted whole days and nights to God&#146;  (Petty, 89). The response to his ministry was often violent, many falling to the ground, rolling around, and shouting out. Their critics dubbed them &#145;ranters&#146;. In response to his sermon at a district meeting in 1824 &#145;believers rejoiced, sinners trembled, while the noise of weeping, praising, and shouts of joy filled the place&#146;  (Shaw, 48).<br>
<br>Oxtoby's mission, early in 1823, to the Yorkshire fishing village of Filey was particularly notable. He had urged action on leaders daunted by previous failures and volunteered his services, but approaching Filey knelt under a hedge in an agony of prayer. A miller resting at the other side heard him cry out to God:<blockquote>Thou munna mak a feal o' me! &hellip; I told them at Bridlington that Thou was ganing to revive Thy work, and Thou must deah so, or I shall never be able to show my face among them again, and then what will the people say about praying and believing?</blockquote>At last he rose, shouting &#145;It is done Lord. It is done. Filey is taken!&#146;  (Shaw, 31). His mission produced an immediate and astonishing response and also made a lasting impression. Some gave up Sunday fishing, drunkenness was &#145;all but abolished&#146;, and there was charitable giving to the poor  (ibid., 32&#150;5).<br>
<br>In 1823 Oxtoby was commissioned as a Primitive Methodist itinerant minister, to which his unmarried state and remarkable stamina were suited. In September 1824 he was dispatched to the Westgate branch in Weardale, co. Durham, and played a sustained and effective part in the remarkable revival already under way. A certain William Dent recalled in 1882 how he first found Oxtoby's person &#145;unprepossessing&#146; and &#145;his dialect the most vulgar Yorkshire&#146;. But he had to acknowledge the power that came from Oxtoby's &#145;taking God at his word&#146;, and concluded, quoting <span class="roman">1 Corinthians</span> 1:27, that &#145;God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise&#146;  (Shaw, 62).<br>
<br>Oxtoby, like other Primitive Methodists, was particularly effective among close-knit communities such as fishermen, miners, and farmers, but several educated women were also converted. His later ministries included towns such as Darlington, Beverley, Barnsley, Doncaster, and Tadcaster. Many remembered his ability to cope with opposition, whether from pranksters or deists; others recalled instances of healing. At Bridlington he comforted a shipowner, Mr Stephenson, by claiming a vision of his long overdue vessel, and when later called to the quayside by its amazed owner instantly recognized it  (Shaw, 93&#150;5).<br>
<br>In July 1828, at Tadcaster, Oxtoby's health began to give way, and at Leeds at Christmas declined further. He was then appointed to the Halifax circuit but was obliged to rest at his sister's house in Londesborough near Market Weighton, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He worked for a while in July but was then obliged to return and take to his bed. His disease baffled his doctors, since he was in little pain, with lungs, intellect, and spirit unimpaired. He died at Londesborough on 19 January 1830, crying &#145;Lord, save souls: do not let them perish!&#146; and then, &#145;Glory, glory, glory!&#146;  (Shaw, 117). He was buried in the churchyard at Warter where a memorial headstone was erected. Recollections of his character and work remained strong in the East Riding and north Lincolnshire long after his death. His biographers acknowledged that his was not a powerful intellect: he was extraordinary rather for his spirituality and, most of all, for the fervour and persistence of his prayers, which earned him the nickname Praying Johnny.<br>
