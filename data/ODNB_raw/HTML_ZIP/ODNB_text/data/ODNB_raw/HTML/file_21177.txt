<span class="headword">Palmer,  Charles John</span>  (1805&#150;1882), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, only son of John Danby Palmer (1769&#150;1841), a merchant, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1819), daughter of Charles Beart, of Gorleston, Suffolk, was born on 1 January 1805 at Great Yarmouth, where the family had lived since the early sixteenth century. Palmer was educated at a private school at Yarmouth, and in 1822 was articled to Robert Cory, an attorney, under whom he had previously served for two years, in order to qualify to become a notary public. He was admitted an attorney in June 1827, and practised at Yarmouth until he was forced to retire owing to ill health.<br>
<br>Palmer's father had served as mayor in 1821 and 1833 and he followed the family tradition of civic service. He was elected to the common council in 1827 and was mayor-elect in 1835, but the passing of the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span> prevented him from taking office. He held a seat in the reformed corporation as a representative of the south ward. In 1854 he was installed as mayor, and was re-elected the following year. He also served as deputy lieutenant for the county of Norfolk. He was anxious to promote Yarmouth as a watering-place and instigated the Victoria Building Company and the Wellington pier, acting as solicitor to both schemes. He also took a prominent part in the establishment of the assembly- and reading-rooms and the Yarmouth Public Library, and was on the restoration committee for the parish church. In 1830 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Palmer married Amelia Graham, daughter of John Mortlock Lacon, on 11 February 1840, but they had no children.<br>
<br>Palmer's antiquarian interests centred upon the town and people of Great Yarmouth, stimulated by the presence there of other antiquarian scholars, such as Dawson Turner and his employer Robert Cory (who had himself compiled notes towards a history of the town), and by his own civic loyalty. His earliest work, a study of the house in which his family had lived since 1809, <span class="italic">The history and illustrations of a house in the Elizabethan style, the property of John Danby esq.</span> (privately printed, 1838) was followed in 1847 by an edition of a sixteenth-century manuscript history of Great Yarmouth, <span class="italic">A Booke of the Foundacion and Antiquitye of the Towne of Greate Yermouthe</span>; Palmer attributed the manuscript to Henry Manship the elder but it has since been shown to have been the work of Thomas Damet, the town clerk. Palmer was a moving force behind the record committee, which was established by the corporation to bring some order to that body's archives; this involvement no doubt contributed to his subsequent publications for which he is best remembered: <span class="italic">The History of Great Yarmouth, by Henry Manship</span> (1854), which he edited; <span class="italic">The History of Great Yarmouth, Designed as a Continuation of Manship's History of that Town</span> (1856); and <span class="italic">The Perlustration of Great Yarmouth, with Gorleston and Southtown</span> (3 vols., 1872&#150;5), which he rightly regarded as his most important achievement. Palmer took the reader through every street of the town, recounting the history of the buildings and the family history of all who lived there. A mine of anecdotal detail and information for the local historian, the <span class="italic">Perlustration</span> is a testament to Palmer's deep affection for the town.<br>
<br>Palmer's other works were considerably briefer and included <span class="italic">Remarks on the Monastery of Dominican Friars at Great Yarmouth</span> (1852), <span class="italic">Memorials of the Family of Hurry, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and of New York, United States</span> (privately printed, 1873), and <span class="italic">Palgrave Family Memorials</span> (privately printed, 1878). He also published a number of pamphlets relating to local affairs in which he was involved, such as the construction of the railway between Norwich and Yarmouth. Palmer died at his home, Villa Graham, Great Yarmouth, on 24 September 1882. His wife survived him.<br>
