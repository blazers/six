<span class="headword">Faversham,  Simon  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1306), <span class="occ">philosopher and theologian</span>, was presumably born at Faversham in Kent, either in the 1240s or, less likely, in the 1260s. He appears to have trained as a theologian at Oxford, though this is not established with certainty. The &Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna, MS 2302, fol. 23<i>r</i>, carries an <i>explicit</i> stating that Faversham disputed his &#145;Questions on the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>&#146; at Paris, and since this work quotes Thomas Aquinas's <span class="italic">Commentary on the Perihermeneias</span>, Simon was probably there in the mid-1270s. Some copies of his works refer to him as Simon Anglicus, so implying that he lectured outside England, and overall, it seems likely that he taught in the arts faculty at Paris before appearing in the theology faculty at Oxford. He was at Oxford in 1301, when he is recorded as participating in the <i>vesperies</i>&#151;an evening disputation which formed part of a master's inception&#151;of the Franciscan Peter of Baldeswell. On 31 January 1304 he became chancellor of the university, and held that office until 9 February 1306.<br>
<br>Faversham's ecclesiastical career in England doubtless began following his return from Paris. He took minor orders as an acolyte in 1283, and was ordained subdeacon at Croydon on 24 September 1289, and deacon at Bocking, Essex, on 23 September 1290. In the latter year he was presented by Archbishop John Pecham to Preston church, near Faversham. He is also reported to have been rector of Harrow, Middlesex, at the time of his death, but the date of 1272 which has sometimes been suggested for his obtaining this benefice seems incompatible with the history of his orders. He was appointed a canon of Hereford (prebend of Hampton) in 1304, and in September 1305 he was named archdeacon of Canterbury, but was forced to resign in the following February in favour of a papal nominee. He was also presented to the rectory of Reculver, Kent, but became involved in litigation with a rival claimant at the papal curia. Commended by Edward I in a letter to Pope Clement V, and fortified with royal letters of protection granted on 24 May, Faversham travelled to Poitiers to defend his claim, but died either at the curia or on his way there, some time before 19 July 1306.<br>
<br>Faversham's extant writings are works of philosophy, especially, but not solely, in the field of logic. They include his <span class="italic">Quaestiones super libros Porphyrii</span>, <span class="italic">Quaestiones super libros Praedicamentorum</span>, <span class="italic">Quaestiones super &#145;Perihermeneias&#146;</span>, <span class="italic">Quaestiones super &#145;Analytica posteriora&#146;</span>, and <span class="italic">Quaestiones super libros Elenchorum</span>, along with certain titles from his <span class="italic">Quaestiones super &#145;Analytica priora&#146;</span>. Some of these <i>quaestiones</i>, for instance those on the <span class="italic">Elench&iuml;</span>, exist in double redactions, indicating that he taught some courses twice. His <span class="italic">Quaestiones super libros Elenchorum</span>, and also parts of his <span class="italic">Commentarium in Summulas logicales Petri Hispani</span> (probably also glossed in the middle of the 1270s at Paris), as well as his <span class="italic">Quaestiones</span> on Porphyry, the <span class="italic">Praedicamenta</span> and the <span class="italic">Perihermeneias</span> have been published, as has his <span class="italic">Sophisma: universale est intentio</span>. Of his works not concerned with logic, the only ones edited so far are his <span class="italic">Quaestiones in tres libros &#145;De anima&#146;</span> and the <span class="italic">Quaestiones super tertium &#145;De anima&#146;</span>. University of Leipzig Library, MS lat. 1359, contains Simon's <span class="italic">Quaestiones super libros topicorum</span>, and the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, and the library of Merton College, Oxford, add the following unpublished treatises to the catalogue of Simon's works: his various <i>dictata</i> on the <span class="italic">Metaphysics</span>, on <span class="italic">De spiritu et anima</span>, on <span class="italic">De intellectu et intelligibili</span>, and on <span class="italic">De somno et vigilia</span>, and his many collections of <i>quaestiones</i>, on the <span class="italic">Physics</span> (reported by Robert Clothall), on <span class="italic">De longitudine et brevitate vitae</span>, <span class="italic">De iuventute et senectute</span>, <span class="italic">De inspiratione et respiratione</span>, <span class="italic">De caelo et mundo</span>, <span class="italic">De generatione et corruptione</span>, <span class="italic">De motu animalium</span>, and <span class="italic">De meteorologicis</span>.<br>
<br>The sources for his thought whom Faversham names are Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome (Egidio Romano). In his <span class="italic">Quaestiones super tertium &#145;De anima&#146;</span>, he refers to Proclus and to a host of ancient and medieval commentators, including Theophrastus, Themistius, Alexander, Avicenna, Averroes, and al-Gazali. Faversham affirms that Averroes's position on the unique possible intellect in all men should not be held, yet he seems to excuse him by noting that what Averroes said on this issue was not in the form of an assertion. His knowledge of the Aristotelian commentators, however, seems to derive less from their own writings than from Albert, and from Aquinas's <span class="italic">Summa contra Gentiles</span>. In regard to Albert and Thomas, Simon cites them, and the sources they provide, yet neither influences his judgment. In forging his own positions, Faversham evaluates his many sources. If any of them seems to have a special appeal, it is Giles of Rome, who often influences the direction of Simon's thought in his treatment of fallacies, and who in the latter's <span class="italic">Quaestiones super libros Elenchorum</span> is styled the <i>Expositor</i>. Another unnamed author, quite likely Pierre d'Auvergne, is frequently followed by Faversham in his logical works. Yet Simon's own thought was taken seriously enough for him to become one of the chief opponents of Rudolphus Brito, who was one of the most prolific and influential developers of modal logic at Paris at the end of the thirteenth century. The edition of Faversham's questions on Porphyry's <span class="italic">Isagoge</span>, and on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Praedicamenta</span> and <span class="italic">Perihermeneias</span>, published by P. Mazzarella in 1957, was intended to be the first volume of his <span class="italic">Opera omnia</span>, but no other volumes have followed.<br>
