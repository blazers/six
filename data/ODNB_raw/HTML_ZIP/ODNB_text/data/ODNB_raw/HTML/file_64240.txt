<span class="headword">Daintrey,  Adrian Maurice</span>  (1902&#150;1988), <span class="occ">artist and art critic</span>, was born on 23 June 1902 at Foulsa Road, Balham, London, the youngest of the three children of Ernest Daintrey, solicitor, and his wife, Lucy Mary Blagdon. His talent for drawing was the only distinction to emerge from his schooldays at Charterhouse, but this was sufficient for his father to encourage him to enter the Slade School of Fine Art, London, in 1920. Daintrey blossomed with the companionship of other students such as Allan Gwynne-Jones and Rex Whistler, and on the strength of one of his paintings, he was awarded a scholarship. However, he smarted under the stern academic regime imposed on the Slade by Henry Tonks (much preferring Philip Wilson Steer). Seeking encouragement in a less rigid approach to art, he introduced himself to Augustus John, and a thirty-five-year relationship began. He frequently joined the circle gathered round John at La Tour Eiffel restaurant in Percy Street, and he visited John's home, Fryern Court, in Hampshire, where he and his fellow painter George Lambourn sometimes helped John's painting speed and concentration by working with him in the studio. Another lifelong friendship established at this time was with Anthony Powell, whom Daintrey met through his neighbour, the artist Nina Hamnett.<br>
<br>Daintrey sought to break out of the strictures of the Slade by copying old masters. He often made use of the National Gallery's copying-days for students, in common with Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. He found them convivial company and shared an enthusiasm for European art. In pursuit of wider horizons he enrolled at the Acad&eacute;mie de la Grande Chaumi&egrave;re in Paris when he had finished at the Slade in 1924. During his stay in Paris he became friends with the painter Matthew Smith, who shared his enthusiasm for impromptu outings. He continued his copying activities at the Louvre but an unhappy love affair and money difficulties made him decide to return to England, and he took up a post of art-master at Dean Close School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. (Daintrey loved women, from prostitutes to high-society ladies, and he devoted time and attention to their pursuit, often at the expense of his painting.) He was rescued from the spiritual discomforts of teaching by an introduction to Dorothy Warren, who ran a gallery which attracted an affluent and aristocratic clientele. On the strength of the exhibition she offered him, he handed in his notice at Dean Close and his career began in earnest. His first show in 1928 was shared with Paul Nash and included a portrait of Augustus John. Among his purchasers from this exhibition was Sir Augustus Daniel, then director of the National Gallery. Through an introduction by John, he met Lord Alington and began his lifelong association with landed and aristocratic patrons from whom he gained many commissions (among the many houses he painted were Chatsworth, Derbyshire; Cliveden, Buckinghamshire; Mereworth Castle, Kent; and Crichel House, Dorset), though he was never entirely free from money worries.<br>
<br>Daintrey had an unfussed painting style reminiscent of the French painter Albert Marquet. Although his portraits were successful, it is for his paintings and distinctive pen-and-wash drawings of landscape and architecture, especially London streets, that he is remembered. His loose yet rhythmic line gave a vitality and deceptive casualness to his draughtsmanship which ensured that it was never laboured or dull. In 1935 he moved to Oakley Street, Chelsea, London. Donald MacLean had a flat at the same address and they quickly developed a sympathetic companionship as &#145;last-minute men&#146;, frequently playing golf (a passion of Daintrey's) together at one of the unfashionable clubs on the outskirts of London. MacLean's extreme political views puzzled Daintrey but he interpreted these attitudes as wild rather than sinister and they were rarely discussed. Certainly MacLean remained on sufficiently intimate terms to act as best man at Daintrey's brief wartime marriage to Pamela Mary Hardy (<i>b</i>. 1919), a Red Cross nurse, on 27 September 1941. (The couple divorced in 1949.)<br>
<br>With the declaration of war, Daintrey joined the air-raid precautions (ARP) and then in June 1940 enlisted in the army as a driver. As an untidy though debonair man, he coped inadequately with the trials of kit-inspections and parades, but was rescued from the increasing nightmare by a commission into the camouflage organization. After training at Farnham, he was posted to the Middle East. Egypt was a revelation to him visually and brought back the desire to paint and draw. He was then moved to Italy for which he developed a lasting passion, returning often after the war, on occasion for specific commissions (such as a set of drawings of Siena for Aubrey Baring).<br>
<br>At the beginning of the 1950s Daintrey found himself out of step as far as London galleries were concerned. He resolved the situation by holding exhibitions of paintings and drawings in his studio, and with the support of his pre-war clientele these provided him with a fairly constant source of income. Sir David Eccles, then minister of works, began buying drawings in series for distribution to British embassies and government houses around the world. In the 1960s there was a revival of a more general, public interest, and he mounted eleven one-man exhibitions between 1964 and 1988. During this period Daintrey did not neglect his literary talents, writing for <span class="italic">Punch</span> as their art critic from 1953 to 1961, and in 1963 publishing a volume of reminiscences, <span class="italic">I must Say</span>, with Chatto and Windus. From the late 1960s he returned to teaching at the City and Guilds (of London) Art School, where he took a highly successful Sunday class for part-time students. Having moved on to become librarian there, he retired finally in the late 1970s, but nevertheless continued to keep up a prodigious output of paintings and drawings from his studio in Little Venice, London, and his trips abroad.<br>
<br>In 1984 Daintrey moved into sheltered accommodation at the old Charterhouse School in London. On 11 October 1988 he died in his sleep at Sutton's Hospital there after a series of small strokes. He was buried at Christ Church, Chelsea, London, on 31 October. His former wife survived him. The British Museum, the Imperial War Museum, St Thomas's Hospital, London, and the Government Art Collection have examples of his work.<br>
