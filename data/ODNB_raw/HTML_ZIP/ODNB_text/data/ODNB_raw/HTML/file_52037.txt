<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oliver <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Joseph]</span>, Dame  Beryl Carnegy</span>  (1882&#150;1972), <span class="occ">charity worker and administrator</span>, was born Beryl Carnegy Joseph on 20 August 1882 in Australia. She was the only daughter of Francis Edward Joseph, gentleman, who later adopted the surname of his wife, Isabella Eliza Butter Carnegy (<i>b</i>. 1862), the daughter of Patrick Carnegy of Lour, Angus (Forfarshire), Scotland, after she succeeded to her father's estates in 1915. Very little is known about Beryl's early life, except that she was educated privately in England and France, as befitted a young lady in society. What is certain is that she embarked upon her lifetime of voluntary service in 1910, when, aged twenty-seven, she joined the St John Ambulance Brigade. By then the brigade was operating under the auspices of the Volunteer Aid Detachment (VAD) training scheme, established in 1909 soon after the passing of the <span class="roman">Territorial and Reserve Forces Act</span> of 1907, and combined the resources of the order of St John of Jerusalem and the British Red Cross Society (BRCS).<br>
<br>Bespectacled and small in stature, with organizational and training skills of particular note, Beryl quickly earned a reputation as a dedicated and hard-working volunteer. On 10 June 1914, in London, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35306/', "Sir Henry Francis Oliver (1865&#150;1965)")</script>, then a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy and later admiral of the fleet, the son of Robert Oliver, a landed proprietor of Lochside, Kelso. Her marriage barely interrupted her career: the couple had no children, and while her husband's naval duties regularly took him abroad, Beryl remained in London, devoting herself to her voluntary work. The outbreak of the First World War created a huge demand for trained volunteers to supplement nursing staff, and she was given responsibility for the military section of the joint VADs, organizing work in hospitals. In 1916 her contribution to the war effort was acknowledged when she was awarded the Royal Red Cross, first class&#151;the decoration instituted by Queen Victoria in 1883, in recognition of special services rendered in nursing the sick and wounded of the army and navy&#151;and St John's honoured her by making her a lady of justice. Further honours followed: she was created CBE in 1919 and DBE in March 1920.<br>
<br>After the First World War, Dame Beryl continued working at VAD headquarters, but soon became embroiled in the debate concerning the proposed disbandment of the VADs. Her vehement opposition to this plan brought her into direct conflict with a number of her St John's colleagues on the War Office committee, and in 1922, when the War Office confirmed its decision to form a new scheme, she expressed her displeasure by resigning from St John's. Her subsequent affiliation to the BRCS was in some respects a defiant action, but, as she admitted, her work as head of the VAD department with responsibility for the promotion and training of detachments nationwide remained much the same; only the uniform changed.<br>
<br>In 1938 Dame Beryl assisted with the planning and implementation of the International Red Cross Conference in London, and the following year, with the outbreak of the Second World War, she was once again able to demonstrate her organizational and supervisory skills. As a member of the war organization executive committee she was responsible for meeting the huge demand for Red Cross personnel overseas. Her membership of the selection committee also involved her in the first posting of service hospital welfare officers to north Africa and the Middle East in 1943. In recognition of her wartime service, in 1945 she received, among other awards, the silver medal of the French Red Cross and the voluntary medical service medal. In 1948 she was invested with the insignia of dame grand cross in the Order of the British Empire (civil division).<br>
<br>After the war Dame Beryl took up the post of director of education to the Red Cross, and on her retirement in 1956 was appointed the society's archivist. Her comprehensive history of the BRCS from its inception, <span class="italic">The British Red Cross in Action</span>, was published in 1966, a year after the death of her husband. The BRCS considered the completion of this book to be a fitting moment to honour her with its highest award, the certificate of honour, class 1. Her other work, <span class="italic">The Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury</span>, was published in 1969. Dame Beryl died at her home, 20 South Eaton Place, Westminster, London, on 13 July 1972. In her will she asked for a requiem mass to be held in her memory at the Anglican church of St Mary, Bourne Street, London, and for her ashes to be interred on the Hill of Lour, Angus.<br>
