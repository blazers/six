<span class="headword">Wager,  William</span>  (1537/8?&#150;1591), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and playwright</span>, was probably born in 1537 or 1538 (in 1579 he testified in chancery that he was &#145;41 yeres and upwardes&#146;), and was almost certainly the son of the playwright <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28394/', "Lewis Wager (d. 1562)")</script>. Although Greg and Chambers refused to accept that W. Wager of two title-pages was necessarily the same person as William Wager, the circumstantial evidence remains persuasive.<br>
<br>Of Wager's education nothing is known. Eccles suggests that, given Wager's strong protestantism, he may have studied abroad during Mary's reign. On 26 October 1562 he married Ellen Godson at St James Garlickhythe, London (where Lewis Wager had been rector). By January 1567 four children had been baptized in the parish, of whom two boys can be traced: Edward at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and Thomas at St John's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Wager became rector of St Benet Gracechurch on 22 July 1567. He also held the living at St Michael Queenhithe, and the rectory of Cradley in Herefordshire. He was licensed to preach, as a lecturer, in any London parish from 6 May 1579, at a stipend of &pound;8 per annum, and was known for his strong protestantism&#151;his &#145;hot words&#146; and anti-papist attacks  (Seaver, 80, 209). This is a link with the plays which can be attributed to him.<br>
<br>The two plays bearing the name W. Wager are polemical protestant interludes. <span class="italic">Enough is as Good as a Feast</span> shows the tragic, but sinful, downfall of Worldly Man, an extortioner who dies refusing grace. It was doubled for seven actors, and influenced by Tyndale and Latimer. It has seventy-four lines in common with the anonymous <span class="italic">Trial of Treasure</span> (1567), and is valued as developing the conventional form of the interlude. Further experimentation continued with <span class="italic">The Longer thou Livest the More Fool thou art</span>, entered in the Stationers' register in April 1569. It was arranged for performance by four actors and was especially enlivened by the musical fool, Moros, who at one point sings &#145;the foot of many songs as fools were wont&#146;.<br>
<br>In public affairs, Wager earned praise for his preaching and was active in pastoral care. In 1569 John Sturgeon, haberdasher, bequeathed him and his churchwardens an annuity of 40<i>s</i>. In 1573 he was appointed a governor of the queen's new grammar school at Barnet, and two years later he is found hearing petitions from inmates of three London prisons. His achievements suggest he was the &#145;Master Wager&#146; who joined two wardens of the Stationers' Company on 4 September 1589 to receive the entry of a ballad on the assassination of Henry III of France  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 2.530). He was buried at St Benet's on 29 March 1591.<br>
<br>Two fragments of a play called &#145;The Cruel Debtor&#146;, entered in the Stationers' register about March 1566 as by Wager, have survived, but as there is no forename in the record, the play may be the work of either William or Lewis (who had died in 1562). A further play attributed to W. Wager, <span class="italic">Tis Good Sleeping in a Whole Skin</span>, was said to have been burnt by William Warburton's cook in the eighteenth century. Greg has demonstrated that the former attribution of <span class="italic">Tom Tyler</span> and <span class="italic">The History of the Trial of Chivalry</span> go back to a palpable error by Edward Phillips in 1675  (Greg, &#145;Dramatic bibliographers&#146;, 325&#150;7). Wager's reputation as a dramatist is now based upon the two extant lively and challenging polemical interludes which have appeal as vigorous examples of their genre, and which were, no doubt, acceptable, as well as contributory, to the expanding protestant culture of their time.<br>
