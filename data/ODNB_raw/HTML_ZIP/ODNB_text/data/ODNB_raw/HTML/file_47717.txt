<span class="headword">Cazenove,  Philip</span>  (1798&#150;1880), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born on 23 November 1798 at Walthamstow, Essex, the fourth son of James Cazenove (1744&#150;1827), merchant, and his wife, Marie-Anne Sophie Houssemayne Du Boulay. Of Huguenot descent James Cazenove was born in Geneva and emigrated to England where he established his own business. He became a naturalized Englishman in 1778 and three years later married Marie-Anne, daughter of the pastor of the French church in Threadneedle Street, London. Four sons, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48875/', "John Cazenove")</script>, and five daughters made up their family. Philip Cazenove, like his three older brothers, was educated at Charterhouse School (from 1813 to 1815). As a young man he developed scholarly and literary tastes and a love of the classics which stayed with him throughout his life; &#145;many playful Latin epigrams issued from his pen on passing events in his family or in the world&#146;  (Kynaston, 14). No record survives of what he did in the three years between 1816 and 1819, but his three older brothers had all joined their father's business and it may well be that he gained some experience of the City by doing so.<br>
<br>However, in 1819 Cazenove was introduced to the stock exchange as clerk to John Francis Menet, a man then in his forties and a stockbroker of only two years' standing. Menet was also of Huguenot descent and was Philip Cazenove's brother-in-law, married since 1805 to his elder sister, Louisa. In 1822 Philip married Emma (<i>d</i>. 1860), daughter of Edward Knapp, a banker. There was already a connection between the families, for Emma's sister Susan had married Philip's brother James two years earlier. Philip and Emma Cazenove had at least three sons.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1823 Cazenove became a member of the stock exchange and, shortly afterwards, Menet's partner. A considerable and prosperous business resulted from this partnership, which lasted until Menet's death in September 1835, and instrumental from its earliest days was a steady flow of work from N. M. Rothschild, then the most influential financier in the City. In 1836, following Menet's death, Cazenove formed a new partnership with two established stockbrokers, Joseph Laurence and Charles Pearce. Four years later Laurence's son, Sydney, joined the partnership along with Cazenove's elder brother, Henry, who had taken up stockbroking after the collapse of the Cazenove family business in 1831. By the 1840s the firm, with its five partners, was one of the largest on the stock exchange, and it seems that its business expanded commensurately. Henry Cazenove retired in 1852 and, probably because the next generation of all three families were looking for partnerships, the Laurence, Cazenove, and Pearce partnership was dissolved in 1854.<br>
<br>Next to be formed was Philip Cazenove &amp; Co., with Cazenove taking as partners his nephew Edward (son of his brother James), and his own son, Henry. In the 1850s the firm's business, already large with a number of merchant banks as clients and a comfortable connection in money broking with Barings, widened as legislation made incorporation with limited liability easily accessible. Cazenove &amp; Co. acted as broker to new issues and flotations of new joint-stock companies on the stock exchange, a business in which it continued to be significant for the rest of the century and indeed into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>After the death of his wife in 1860 Cazenove remained the titular head of the firm but now devoted more of his time and energy to good works and charitable activities. He acted as treasurer, and was himself a generous contributor, to a number of church charities, including the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, the National Society, and the Additional Curates' Society. He was an active member of the governing bodies of several hospitals (including Guy's Hospital, London, and St Luke's Hospital for the Insane) and philanthropic institutions. In 1872 Cazenove was elected a member of an influential if little-known association, the Club of Nobody's Friends. It comprised clerics and significant figures from the City of London, including the financier Henry Hucks Gibbs.<br>
<br>In 1873 Cazenove formally retired from the firm, leaving it in the hands of his son Henry; his nephew, Edward Cazenove, had died in 1857. Philip Cazenove continued to work for the Council of Foreign Bondholders, of which he had become a member in 1869, until his death in Clapham, London, where he had lived, on 20 January 1880. St Michael's Church, Clapham, which was consecrated in 1881, was built partly in memory of him.<br>
<br>Cazenove's sound business brain and sober working habits, combined with a degree of personal frugality, amassed for him a considerable fortune, enabling him to be &#145;one of the great Christian philanthropists of the age&#146;  (Kynaston, 14). The firm which he played such a large part in creating, known since 1954 as Cazenove &amp; Co., continued to be a considerable force in the City of London. Cazenove was buried in the family vault in Hornsey churchyard, Middlesex.<br>
