<span class="headword">Stoughton,  William</span>  (1631&#150;1701), <span class="occ">colonial official and preacher</span>, was born on 30 September 1631, probably in England, the second son, and one of at least six children, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26605/', "Israel Stoughton (bap. 1603, d. 1644)")</script>, and Elizabeth Knight (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;1681). The Stoughton family migrated to Massachusetts Bay in 1632 and in the following year Israel was admitted as a freeman of the colony. Though disciplined for his controversial religious and political views during the antinomian controversy, Israel Stoughton became a magistrate, captain of the artillery company, and a substantial landowner in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He returned to England at the outbreak of the civil war and served as lieutenant-colonel in Thomas Rainsborow's regiment until his death at Lincoln in 1644.<br>
<br>William Stoughton graduated BA from Harvard College in 1650 and proceeded MA from New College, Oxford, in 1653. He was elected fellow of New College, Oxford, and was appointed minister at Rumboldswycke in Sussex in 1659, but lost both positions with the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660. Stoughton returned to Massachusetts in 1662 and became a respected preacher in Dorchester. His election sermon of 1668, containing the phrase &#145;God sifted a whole Nation that he might send choice Grain over into this wilderness&#146;, marks him as one of the second-generation architects of the New England &#145;errand&#146;. Stoughton recalled to his audience the high moral standard that God had set for his elect nation, which he envisioned as under siege by Satan and his agents: &#145;The Lord will never cease working, afflicting, sifting, purging &hellip; although there be but a <i>Remnant</i> that will endure and hold out thereunto&#146;  (Stoughton, <span class="italic">New England's True Interest</span>, 17, 19).<br>
<br>Stoughton rejected calls to accept a permanent ministerial position as pastor or teacher of a congregation, was never married, and had no children. His life focused on politics, farming, and land speculation. He became a freeman of the colony in 1665, and like his father was an assistant in the general court of Massachusetts from 1671 to 1686. He was commissioner of the united colonies from 1674 to 1676, and again from 1680 to 1686. Stoughton was in England from 1677 to 1679 with Peter Bulkeley as a colonial agent for Massachusetts, countering the rival claims of Mason and Gorges to parts of the northern Massachusetts frontier, and diffusing the accusations of Randall Holden and John Greene against the militant encroachment of Massachusetts on Narragansett lands. As colonial agent, too, he penned a strong response to Edward Randolph's public charges against Massachusetts for non-compliance with the navigation laws and non-conformity to the Church of England.<br>
<br>Having completed his tenure as colonial agent, Stoughton returned to Massachusetts, where he established a reputation as a political moderate. With the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in October 1684, he was appointed deputy president of the dominion of New England for the interim preceding the arrival of the royal governor Edmund Andros in 1686. He was a member of Andros's governing council and was appointed judge assistant under Chief Justice Joseph Dudley. Stoughton's moderate views alienated him from the popular colonial faction, but he was never on good terms with Andros. In April 1689 he was one of the &#145;inhabitants of New England&#146; who issued a proclamation ordering Andros to &#145;surrender the Government and fortifications&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 13.261), although he took no direct part in the uprising upon news of the revolution in England. He was also one of the five authors who celebrated the overthrow of the Andros regime in <span class="italic">The Revolution in New England Justified</span> (1691) and was appointed lieutenant-governor under Sir William Phips with the new charter of 1691.<br>
<br>Most notably, Stoughton was chief justice of the 1692 court of oyer and terminer that was convened for the purpose of trying the witchcraft cases generated by the outbreak of accusations in Salem village and surrounding communities. Unlike the majority of his ministerial colleagues, who believed that God permitted Satan to appear in the shapes of innocent persons, Stoughton maintained that divine justice would not permit the devil to belie the reputations of true believers. He thus took the spectral evidence offered by tormented accusers at face value, and with infamous irony presided over the conviction and execution of nineteen persons for witchcraft in the summer of 1692. Phips dissolved the court of oyer and terminer in October, but appointed Stoughton as chief justice of the newly chartered supreme court of judiciary. When the new court resumed witchcraft trials in the winter of 1693, Phips released most of the accused and reprieved five condemned persons in May 1693, whereupon Stoughton was &#145;filled with passionate anger&#146; and refused to come to court  (<span class="italic">CSP col.</span>, 14.112). Believing that witches were still at large in New England, he never repented of his role in the witchcraft trials. Some years later, when his judicial colleague and fellow councillor Samuel Sewall publicly apologized for his own role in the trials, Stoughton snubbed him by neglecting to invite Sewall to an official dinner, although he later named Sewall as executor of his will.<br>
<br>When Stoughton supplied evidence that led to Phips's recall to England in 1694 on charges of misgovernment, he was appointed acting governor of Massachusetts in place of the unpopular Phips. During his tenure as governor he continued to serve as chief justice in the superior court. In 1698 he donated Stoughton Hall to Harvard College, which was completed in 1699 and was featured in his portrait (<i>c</i>.1700). With the governorship Stoughton inherited the ongoing challenge of defending New England's frontiers against the French and their native allies. Writing to the Board of Trade in 1701, Edward Randolph characterized Stoughton as &#145;a person learned and conversant in books, but wholly unacquainted with military discipline&#146;  (<span class="italic">Randolf</span>, 6.254). Despite his deteriorating health in the spring of 1701, Stoughton continued to write letters to England requesting military supplies. In June the lieutenant-governor of New York recommended that he attend the treaty negotiations between the Iroquois, English, and French at Albany that were planned for the coming July. Stoughton, however, died at his home in Dorchester on 7 July 1701. He was interred in Dorchester burial-ground on 15 July.<br>
