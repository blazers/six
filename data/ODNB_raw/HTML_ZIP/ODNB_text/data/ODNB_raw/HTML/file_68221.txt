<span class="headword">Cranston,  Andrew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">creator of a public library</span>, was born in the late 1650s in Scotland to unknown parents. He was perhaps connected to the lords Cranstoun, for the descendants of his only known brother, James, assumed the same coat of arms. There is a volume in his library inscribed to him from Dr Alexander Cranston of Edinburgh in 1676, who may be another relative.<br>
<br>Cranston attended Edinburgh University, graduating BA in 1673. In 1681 he was presented to the parish of Greenock, Renfrewshire, by Sir John Schaw. He received a testimonial for ordination from the presbytery at Renfrew on 1 June and was instituted on 5 July 1681. He left the parish after only nine months; he was absent for much of this time, and had refused to subscribe to the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. In May 1683, about to depart a troubled Scotland, he donated 520 books to Edinburgh University Library. The gift was revoked a year later, however, for he had chosen to make his home in England. He may have joined his brother James, a fellow graduate of Edinburgh, who had been ordained at Ely in 1683.<br>
<br>Cranston settled at Reigate, Surrey, where on 5 May 1687 he married Mary (<i>c</i>.1662&#150;1707), daughter of the vicar, John Williamson (<i>d</i>. 1697). The marriage licence gave Cranston's age as about twenty-seven. Several children were baptized at Reigate, but only a daughter, Elizabeth, survived infancy.<br>
<br>In 1693 Cranston was instituted to the parish of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, though it appears he was never resident there. He ceded Shepton when, after his father-in-law's death, he was instituted as vicar of Reigate on 29 October 1697. Cranston also inherited the mastership of Reigate Free School, occupying both offices until his death. In 1697 he was incorporated MA at Cambridge, and from 1699 he was vicar of Newdigate.<br>
<br>In 1700 Cranston became a correspondent of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) and shortly afterwards began monthly catechism classes and communion services. Early in 1701 he undertook his chief work, the foundation of a lending library, since maintained in the upper vestry of Reigate parish church for over three centuries. It was initially intended for the clergy of Ewell archdeaconry, but its terms were expanded by a deed of 4 November 1708 to establish it as a public library &#145;for the use and perusal of the Freeholders, Vicar and Inhabitants&#146; of Reigate, &#145;and of the Gentlemen and Clergymen inhabiting in parts thereunto adjacent&#146;  (Hooper, 63). Several local figures donated books, including John Evelyn, the earl of Shaftesbury, and the speaker Arthur Onslow, while Cranston himself gave some seventy works and obtained others from the SPCK. By 1705 the library contained over 1600 volumes, most concerned with contemporary theology. It remains a significant, early example of a public lending library.<br>
<br>Cranston died on 11 December 1708 and was buried in the vestry of Reigate church, underneath his library. A Latin epitaph claims he &#145;was indefatigable in his munificence, and even in death does not desist from collecting for coming generations&#146;.<br>
