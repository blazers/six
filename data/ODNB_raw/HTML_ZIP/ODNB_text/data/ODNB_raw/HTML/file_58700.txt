<span class="headword">Thompson,  Elizabeth Maria  Bowen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elizabeth Maria Lloyd]</span>  (1812/13&#150;1869), <span class="occ">missionary in Syria</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16835/', "Hannibal Evans Lloyd (1770&#150;1847)")</script>, a philologist and translator, and his wife, Lucy Anna Margaretta von Schwartzkopff (1782/3&#150;1855), who was from Hamburg. Her father lived in Hamburg between 1800 and 1813, after which he returned to England on account of the hardships of the French occupation. Elizabeth inherited a spirit of travel and adventure from her paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16836/', "Henry Humphrey Evans Lloyd (c.1718&#150;1783)")</script>, an army officer; her practicality is said to have come from her mother. She had three sisters who later joined her in her missionary work&#151;Susette, later Mrs Henry Smith, Augusta, later Mrs Mentor Mott, and Sophia, who remained unmarried&#151;and a brother of whom very little is known. Her father's cousin was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24563/', "Henry Salt")</script>, the discoverer of the Rosetta stone and one-time British consul in Alexandria&#151;a family connection with the Middle East. She was religiously inclined from childhood, when she was taunted for being &#145;a little saint&#146;  (Lloyd, 3). She came under revivalist influences in Scotland while visiting friends and relatives there, and also came into contact with Unitarians. She herself notably converted a young sergeant on his way to China, whose fervour was such that he held <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes on board the <i>Himalaya</i>.<br>
<br>Lloyd identified herself early on with the cause of black education and was a founder, and joint secretary with one of her sisters, of the Ladies Society for the Early Education of Negro Children. She later joined the Syro-Egyptian committee under the presidency of Sir Culling Eardley, in which connection she probably met her future husband, Dr James Bowen Thompson. Thompson had been a medical missionary in Syria and director of the British Syrian Hospital in Damascus, which he had opened and ran from 1843 to 1848. After living in London, where they married on 14 December 1850 at St Botolph, Aldersgate, they went to Constantinople to pursue Thompson's pet project of opening a direct railway communication to India via the Euphrates valley. In December 1852 or January 1853 they moved to Suediah, near Antioch, where Thompson possessed some property, and resided there until June 1855. It was during this time that Elizabeth Bowen Thompson was initiated to the language and manners of the East, and &#145;her full heart yearned over the darkness and deprivation of the women&#146;. She once began a school in her own house in Suediah. James Bowen Thompson died at Constantinople on 5 August 1855, of a &#145;malignant fever&#146;, reportedly contracted at Balaclava.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Bowen Thompson subsequently returned to London, where she lived with her sister Augusta. She was active with her sisters and other members of her family in several charitable enterprises, such as the committee led by the lady mayoress of London for the Indian mutiny. She also started the Central Association for Soldiers' Wives and became active, in 1860, in the Syrian Temporal Relief Fund. This involvement led to her departure for Beirut after news of the massacres in Mount Lebanon and Damascus reached her. Her voyage was preceded by a prayer meeting at the house of the Revd William Pennefather, the founder of the Mildmay conference hall, the home of much foreign mission work. She arrived in Beirut on 27 October 1860 and took a house called Beyt &#145;Ayub Bek; her original intention was to stay for six months. However, she was handicapped at the outset by an attack of rheumatic fever, and it was not until December that she began her work, initially with thirty women, mostly widows from the massacres of Hasba&#145;iyyah, and sixteen children. Assistance was forthcoming from Lord Dufferin, who was there engaged in a diplomatic mission, and his mother, Helen Selina Blackwood, the dowager duchess.<br>
<br>Bowen Thompson's arrival coincided with a time when the established American missions in Beirut were undergoing a financial crisis caused mainly by the American Civil War, and when the Anglo-American committee was distributing relief without doing any educational or missionary work. She was joined by her sister Augusta Mentor Mott and the latter's husband in January 1861, following the destruction of their house by fire, and was additionally joined by her sister Sophia Lloyd in the summer of 1862. Her third sister, Susette, remained active in the cause from London, until she herself went to work in Beirut in 1875.<br>
<br>Bowen Thompson's friends in England formed a society to support her, the Society for the Social and Religious Improvement of Syrian Females, and there was another association, formed under the leadership of Lord Shaftesbury, for the establishment of English industrial and ragged schools in Syria. The former, which was formally constituted as a mission at the house of the Hon. Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, also enjoyed the patronage of Lord Shaftesbury, who later became its chairman. Mary Jane, Lady Kinnaird, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hoare, to whom the Lloyds were probably related, was president; the secretary was Elizabeth Bowen Thompson's sister Susette Smith, and her other sister Augusta also sat on the committee. The organization evolved to become the Ladies' Association for the Social and Religious Improvement of the Syrian Females, later the British Syrian Schools and Bible Mission for the Social and Religious Improvement of the Syrian Females (1876), then the British Syrian Schools and Bible Mission (1882), and finally the British Syrian Mission. The successor institution in the late twentieth century was Middle East Christian Outreach.<br>
<br>The schools in Beirut were visited by the prince of Wales during his visit to the Middle East in 1862 and attracted the attention and support of Fuat Pasha, who later became grand vizier. Bowen Thompson also established a good relationship, after an initial clash, with Daoud Pasha, the governor of Mount Lebanon, who gave her an official escort and went personally with her to Ain Zhalta at the opening of the Palm Branch School there on 13 October 1867. Following the establishment of the schools and workrooms and the training of <span class="roman">Bible</span> women in Beirut she also established a school in Hasba&#145;iyyah on 28 September 1863 and received numerous requests from places like Zahlah, Deir al-Qamar, and, later, Damascus, all cities that had suffered badly in 1860. She was against the provision of free schooling and charged each student &#145;according to their several ability&#146;. Her aim was to create independent institutions &#145;unfettered by any official authorization&#146;, and she encountered a lot of opposition from Roman Catholic clergy. Furthermore, in 1866 she had to close a small school in Deir al-Qamar because of local opposition, with the native teacher going to prison as a result.<br>
<br>Bowen Thompson's real breakthrough came with the granting of an imperial firman in 1868, giving her full powers to open schools at Zahlah and Deir al-Qamar and calling for the authorities to give her the fullest aid and protection. This was suggested by the prince of Wales to the sultan during the latter's visit to London in 1867, and supported by the British ambassador to the Porte, and by Fuat Pasha, the grand vizier. In the same year a school for blind children was opened in Beirut. In 1865 and 1866 Bowen Thompson was in England, and took with her some of the products of her schools to sell. She was awarded a prize at the International Reformatory and Schools Exhibition, and also established branch associations in parts of England and Scotland. She was helped by donations from the prince of Wales and Lady Francis Egerton, who established the Ellsmere School in Deir al-Qamar, while funds for the Olive Branch School were contributed by the officers and men of HMS <i>Mars</i>. A Mr Tabet gave up his house in Beirut for the establishment of the school there and a notable in Zahlah also donated his house: the mission's motto was <i>Jehovah jireh</i> (&#145;God will provide&#146;). Although her initial goal was to work with women left widowed by the civil war, Bowen Thompson also taught children of Druze princes and Muslim notables who came to her. Sitt Naifeh Junblatt gave her support at the initial stages of her setting up in Hasba&#145;iyyah. Only one publication by her is known, a simplified version of Edward Greswell's <span class="italic">Harmony of the Gospels</span> turned into a narrative suited for classes&#151;which was later translated into Arabic by Salim Bustani.<br>
<br>Bowen Thompson, whose family motto was &#145;Dare and persevere&#146;, fell ill after a tough journey from Zahlah to Damascus in snow, and never recovered fully. She later went on business to Constantinople and England, where she died in Charlton, Blackheath, at Morden College, in the house of her sister Susette, on 14 November 1869. Her body was laid to rest by the side of her father and mother at &#145;God's Acre&#146;&#151;a secluded cemetery at Morden College, which was founded by an ancestor of Susette's husband, Henry William Smith, the treasurer of the college. Her sisters continued the work of the mission after her death.<br>
