<span class="headword">Younger,  George Kenneth Hotson</span>, Baron Younger of Prestwick and fourth Viscount Younger of Leckie  (1931&#150;2003), <span class="occ">brewer, politician, and banker</span>, was born on 22 September 1931 at Garfield House, Victoria Square, Stirling, the eldest child in the family of three sons and one daughter of Edward George (Teddy) Younger, third Viscount Younger of Leckie (1906&#150;1997), brewer and public servant, and his wife, Evelyn Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1983), daughter of Alexander Logan McClure, advocate, of Edinburgh. He was the great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37082/', "George Younger, first Viscount Younger")</script> of Leckie, brewer and politician, and nephew of Sir Kenneth Gilmour Younger, politician and reformer. His early life was spent in Stirling, but with frequent visits to the nearby family estate at Leckie, Gargunnock. He was educated at Cargilfield School, Edinburgh, and then at Winchester College. In later life he was made warden of the college, an honour of which he was immensely proud. Aged fourteen he lost an index finger in a shooting accident: as he was climbing over a wall, the gun fell to the ground and went off.<br>
<br>Before entering university Younger was commissioned as a national service officer into the Argyll and Sutherland highlanders (in which his father had served during the Second World War), but because he was only eighteen he was initially too young to assume active service in Korea (the 1st Argylls having been sent there). Instead he was first posted to the 1st Black Watch in Berlin, where he met Diana Rhona Tuck, whose father, Captain Gerald Seymour Tuck (then a commodore in the Royal Navy), was deputy commissioner of the military security board in Berlin. They married on 7 August 1954, and had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>During the bitter winter of 1950&#150;51 Younger saw active service in Korea as a platoon commander. After completing his national service he continued as a territorial for fifteen years, and had a lifelong association with the military. In 1968 he spearheaded the successful Save the Argylls campaign, culminating in a one-million-signatory petition to the House of Commons, delivered in whisky boxes. In later life he took up several honorary military posts, most notably as lieutenant in the queen's bodyguard for Scotland, the Royal Company of Archers. Once, while defence secretary, he described the ceremonial bows and arrows he sported as &#145;the ultimate deterrent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>).<br>
<br>After national service Younger read modern history at New College, Oxford. The college authorities thought it would be amusing if he shared a room with Charles Guinness, the son of another famous brewing family. At Oxford he became proficient in the French horn, founding the Oxford University Confederation of Horns. He was later made an honorary fellow of New College. On leaving Oxford in 1954 with a third-class degree he made his family home in Alva, Clackmannanshire, entering the family firm, George Younger &amp; Son, in Alloa. He later joined the wines and spirits division in Edinburgh as sales director, where he remained until he entered parliament.<br>
<br>Younger's political career seemed to be assured for life when (having lost out to Peggy Herbison in North Lanarkshire in 1959) he was adopted as the Conservative and Unionist candidate for the safe seat of Kinross and West Perthshire in 1963, but fate took a hand: Sir Alec Douglas-Home needed a seat on renouncing his peerage to become prime minister. Younger did the decent thing and stood aside. His sacrificial act was soon rewarded with the marginal seat of Ayr in time for the 1964 election, a constituency his great-grandfather, the first viscount, had held from 1906 to 1922. Defending a marginal seat became quite a challenge, leading to two very narrow scrapes, in 1966 (majority 484) and again in 1987 (majority 182). That Ayr remained in Conservative hands for so long was largely due to Younger's vigorous defence of its interests, particularly in ensuring that Prestwick airport retained its status as an international transatlantic terminal.<br>
<br>Only a year after entering parliament Younger was made a Scottish Conservative whip, and then deputy chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland, in 1967. On Edward Heath's general election victory in 1970 Younger became parliamentary under-secretary of state in charge of economic development under Gordon Campbell, in which post he helped to introduce Japanese industrialists to Scotland's new &#145;Silicon Glen&#146;. Younger held the post until just before the 1974 election, when he served for a very brief stint as minister of state for defence, just before the Conservatives were cast into opposition. In 1975 the new leader of the party, Margaret Thatcher, promoted Younger to front-bench shadow defence spokesman, but dropped him only eight months later to make room for Ian Gilmour. A year later he agreed to serve as deputy to Teddy Taylor, named shadow secretary of state for Scotland on the resignation of Alick Buchanan-Smith following Thatcher's U-turn on Scottish devolution.<br>
<br>With the Conservatives back in power in 1979 the fate that had counted against Younger in the past turned in his favour. Had Teddy Taylor not lost his Glasgow Cathcart seat at the general election, Younger might not have become Margaret Thatcher's first secretary of state for Scotland, holding the post for six and a half years, longer than any other incumbent. He rapidly formed what amounted to a semi-autonomous mini-government north of the border, issuing ministers with public portfolios for the first time, and giving them more responsibility than had been seen previously. But as Thatcher remarked in her memoirs, &#145;There was no Tartan Thatcherite revolution&#146;  (Thatcher, 618). Younger was very much in the &#145;one-nation&#146; mould of Tory politicians, pursuing pragmatic interventionist policies in Scotland. This policy was most obviously seen in his defence of traditional industries: in 1982 his threat of resignation gave the strategically important Ravenscraig steelworks near Motherwell a stay of execution until its eventual closure six years later. Throughout his long stint as secretary of state for Scotland Younger enjoyed a successful tenure, always conducting himself with self-deprecating charm, good humour, and an innate courtesy, traits that earned him the nickname Gentleman George; when he left the post his under-secretaries presented him with a silver miniature replica of a bed of nails  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). Younger's one major failure, however, was to underestimate the furious backlash against the revaluation of the Scottish rating system in 1985, and his subsequent attraction to a new system of local government finance, the community charge or &#145;poll tax&#146;.<br>
<br>In January 1986 luck again turned in Younger's favour. After Michael Heseltine walked out of cabinet in protest at Thatcher's handling of the Westland affair, concerning a defence contract for the purchase of helicopters, Younger was promoted to secretary of state for defence. He became very popular with the armed forces, partly because of his prior military service, but also because of his successful defence of the ministry's budget in the annual spending reviews. And just as he had done in Scotland, Younger spread the work of defence procurement to ensure the survival of as many factories and shipyards as possible. In 1988 he signed a protocol on defence sales with the Malaysian government under which &pound;1 billion of arms sales were linked to &pound;200 million of British aid, mainly to finance the Pergau Dam hydro-electric project. The foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, had not been consulted before Younger signed the agreement. In 1994 a foreign affairs select committee report described Younger's failure to inform the Foreign Office as &#145;reprehensible&#146;. In mitigation Younger felt he was sufficiently senior to negotiate the deal without consulting colleagues at home, and that such a move might have looked weak in the eyes of the Malaysians. In any event Younger took full responsibility for his actions.<br>
<br>In 1989 Younger helped to run Margaret Thatcher's successful campaign against Sir Anthony Meyer, the so-called &#145;stalking horse&#146; candidate who was challenging her for the party's leadership. Shortly afterwards the prime minister hinted at the possibility of the Foreign Office in a vain attempt to stop Younger leaving the government to become director and then chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland group. (The post of chairman had been kept open for him for some five years.) In November 1990, when she was challenged by Michael Heseltine, he was again asked to act as Thatcher's campaign manager, and later attracted, rather unfairly, some of the blame for the failure of her campaign. The prime minister's offer placed Younger in a quandary. Honour-bound to accept or risk being perceived as disloyal, he did so only on condition that others did the work, because by this stage he was too busy with his work at the Royal Bank, where his mission was to establish a Scottish-based bank as an international force. In that he succeeded, presiding over the most successful period in the bank's history, culminating in the takeover of the much larger NatWest group in March 2001. Younger's natural charm had helped to convince the City of London and the relevant shareholders of the takeover's merits.<br>
<br>Younger retired as a Conservative MP in 1992, being raised to the peerage as Baron Younger of Prestwick. As well as taking on many company directorships, he accepted dozens of voluntary posts, British as well as Scottish, moving Sir Malcolm Rifkind to comment on his death: &#145;There has hardly been a major Scottish institution that has not benefited from his voluntary service in recent times&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>). Most notably he was chairman of the celebrations of the fortieth anniversary of the queen's coronation, for which he was appointed KCVO. In 1995 he became one of the sixteen knights of the Order of the Thistle. Two years later he inherited the viscountcy on the death of his father. He died of cancer at his home, Leckie House, Gargunnock, near Stirling, on 26 January 2003, and was survived by his wife, Diana, and their four children. He was succeeded as Viscount Younger by his eldest son, James (<i>b</i>. 1955). As Baroness Thatcher rightly said of Younger in her memoirs, &#145;His career is proof of the fact that, contrary to myth, gentlemen still have a place in politics&#146;  (Thatcher, 756).<br>
