</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Khan, Abdul Ghaffar</span>  (1890&#150;1988), <span class="occ">Pakhtun nationalist</span>, was born in the village of Utmanzai in the Peshawar district of the North-West Frontier Province. He was the fourth child of Khan Behram Khan, an influential Muhammadzai landlord. Following admission to a mosque school at the age of five, he was educated at the municipal board high school, Peshawar, and the Edwardes Memorial Mission School. He quit before completing his studies, to obtain an army commission. He reportedly abandoned this career because he had witnessed a British subaltern insulting an Indian officer. He then restlessly spent a brief spell in a school at Campbellpur and attended the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh. Behram Khan wanted him to follow his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34311/', "Khan Sahib")</script>, to England for studies, but this plan also fell through.<br>
<br>Despite his own chequered education, Abdul Ghaffar Khan worked from 1910 onwards to popularize schooling among the unlettered Pakhtun tribesmen of the frontier. The Pakhtun nationalist the Haji of Turangzai encouraged his endeavours. He was also influenced at this time by the Muslim seminary at Deoband which he clandestinely visited, and by the writings of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who later became the most prominent Muslim Congressman.<br>
<br>Abdul Ghaffar Khan clashed with the British in April 1919, when he organized a public meeting at Utmanzai to protest against the <span class="roman">Rowlatt Act</span>, which curtailed Indian legal rights in case of emergency. He was arrested but was released shortly afterwards. He thus embarked on a life of prolonged spells of imprisonment by both the British and Pakistani authorities. After his release he led a party of <i>muhajarins</i> (religious refugees) to Afghanistan in August 1920 during the <i>khilafat</i> movement of protest against the treatment of the <i>khilafat</i>, the sultan of Turkey, after the First World War by the victorious allies. He soon retraced his steps convinced of the futility of <i>hijrat</i> (religious flight) and attended the December Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress. This session was dominated by the Gandhians, who adopted the creed of non-violent non-co-operation which became the guiding principle of his own public career. Indeed, in later years he was known as the Frontier Gandhi. He resumed his educational activities in 1921, opening an Azad high school at Utmanzai and forming the Anjuman Islah-ul-Afghania (Society for the Reform of the Afghans) to carry on his work. By this date he had also been elected president of the provincial <i>khilafat</i> committee. His anti-British activities culminated in arrest on 17 December 1921. The poor diet in the frontier and Punjab gaols in which he served his three-year sentence undermined his health. But his spirit was unvanquished, he mixed freely with Hindu and Sikh prisoners, and for the first time read the Hindu scriptural text, the <span class="roman">Gita</span>, and the Sikh scripture, the <span class="roman">Granth Sahib</span>. On his release his followers honoured him with the title Fakhr-i-Afghan (the Pride of the Afghans).<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards he proceeded on <i>haj</i> to Mecca with his second wife and her elder sister. The pilgrimage ended tragically in Jerusalem, where his wife fell to her death from a staircase leaving a son, Abdul Ali, and a daughter, Mehar Taj. Abdul Ghaffar Khan's first wife, who had borne him two sons, Ghani and Wali Khan, had also died prematurely, during an influenza epidemic. Ghaffar Khan did not remarry after this second tragedy.<br>
<br>In May 1928 Abdul Ghaffar Khan launched the monthly Pashto language journal, the <span class="italic">Pakhtun</span>, which thereafter served as his mouthpiece. Through its columns he expounded his philosophy of Pakhtun nationalism, moral and social reform, non-violence, and Islam. The following year he embodied these ideals in a new grass-roots party called the Afghan Jirga. Three months later, in November 1929, he launched a parallel organization, the Khudai Khidmatgars (&#145;Servants of God&#146;), which was established on quasi-military lines. This movement soon overshadowed the Afghan Jirga. Its members wore uniforms dyed with red brick dust, since their ordinary white clothing showed the dirt too easily. The British thereafter dubbed them the Red Shirts.<br>
<br>Abdul Ghaffar Khan toured the frontier to enrol Khudai Khidmatgars. He both called on the people to reform their social and religious condition, and articulated the poorer classes' grievances against the pro-British large khans from whom he said &#145;they could expect nothing&#146; as their only &#145;desire was to shake hands with the Sahib Bahadurs and to secure employment for their sons&#146;. Although his organizations proclaimed the goal of complete Indian independence, they only affiliated to the Congress in August 1931. Its leaders at this and other times deferred to him because of his immense authority and mass following. The Khudai Khidmatgars' involvement in the civil disobedience struggles of 1930&#150;32, moreover, strengthened the Congress's national claim to be a secular cross-communal organization. For his part, Abdul Ghaffar Khan allied with them in the Indian freedom struggle and quest for Hindu&#150;Muslim unity, but his first priority remained specifically Pakhtun interests.<br>
<br>The British arrested Abdul Ghaffar Khan in April 1930 at the outset of the civil disobedience movement in the frontier. The unrest continued unabated, however, during his incarceration in Gujrat gaol. While in prison he fasted and observed a day of silence each week. He was released after the Gandhi&#150;Irwin pact of 5 March 1931 which ended civil disobedience, and returned in triumph. Many in the crowds which flocked to hear him speak regarded him as a saint who could cure diseases. It was also from this time that he was called the Frontier Gandhi. Abdul Ghaffar Khan certainly cut an impressive figure, tall, rugged, and bearded, clad in rough <i>khadi</i> (hand-spun cloth) which he at times wrapped over his head.<br>
<br>The ensuing truce between the Congress and the raj collapsed with the failure of the second round-table conference early in December 1931. Abdul Ghaffar Khan toured the Peshawar valley in preparation for a civil disobedience campaign. The British, however, struck first, and in a crackdown on 24 December they arrested him and the other top frontier nationalists including his brother Dr Khan Sahib. But the continuing disturbances convinced the British that repression should be tempered by constitutional reform. In 1932 they accordingly extended representative government to the frontier.<br>
<br>The Khan brothers were released in August 1934, but externed from the frontier and the neighbouring Punjab. Undaunted they travelled as far afield as Patna, Allahabad, and Calcutta to address meetings. They also stayed as guests at Gandhi's Wardha <i>ashram</i> in central India. Abdul Ghaffar Khan was perfectly at home in its austere and simple surroundings. His children Abdul Ali and Mehar Taj later joined him at the <i>ashram</i>. He refused to preside over the 1934 Bombay Congress session, declaring: &#145;I am a Khudai Khidmatgar, I shall only render service&#146;. He nevertheless consented to inaugurate the <i>swadeshi</i> exhibition at Bombay and joined the executive committee of the All-India Village Industries Association, which was devoted to Gandhian economic reconstruction. Abdul Ghaffar Khan was rearrested at Wardha on 7 December 1934 after exactly 100 days' freedom. He was later charged with speaking in a way to &#145;cause disaffection and bring the Government into hatred and contempt&#146;. He served a two-year sentence in Bombay and United Provinces gaols before being released in August 1936. Another year passed before he could return to the frontier. His homecoming resulted from the formation of a Congress-led coalition ministry headed by his brother Dr Khan Sahib following the 1937 provincial elections. Ghaffar Khan used his unaccustomed freedom to reorganize the Khudai Khidmatgars. He also arranged tours for both J. Nehru and Gandhi. On the occasion of the latter's visit in September 1938 he emphasized the importance of the principles of non-violence.<br>
<br>Dr Khan Sahib's ministry resigned following the outbreak of the Second World War. The subsequent civil disobedience movement initiated by the Congress was, in the frontier, very muted in comparison with other regions. Disturbances were limited to the Mardan district. When he attempted to make his way there in defiance of a government ban, Abdul Ghaffar Khan was arrested once more, on 27 October 1942. He spent the remainder of the war years in prisons at Haripur, Abbottabad, and Risalpur. He ran literacy classes for the Khudai Khidmatgars and encouraged them to read both the <span class="roman">Koran</span> and the <span class="roman">Gita</span>. Every Sunday the political prisoners assembled to sing Iqbal's national verse, &#145;Hindustan Hamara&#146;. This was followed by talks, discussion, and story-telling. Such displays of communal amity increasingly contrasted with the polarization outside the prison walls. By the time of his release in 1945 the Muslim League had emerged as a major force in both frontier and all-India politics.<br>
<br>Ghaffar Khan attended the 1945 Simla conference as a Congress delegate. He also campaigned vigorously in the 1946 provincial elections. Although the Congress retained power in the frontier, the Muslim League's advance in the Punjab strengthened its Pakistan demand. The Congress high command reluctantly accepted the idea of partition as the price of independence. In Abdul Ghaffar Khan's eyes, however, this was an act of betrayal which threw the Khudai Khidmatgars &#145;to the wolves&#146;. He exhorted his followers to boycott the June 1947 referendum on the frontier's future, as it did not include an option for Pakhtunistan along with those for India and Pakistan. The referendum result was a crushing blow for the Khan brothers. More than 99 per cent of the total number of votes were cast for Pakistan, although the turnout at 51 per cent was admittedly low.<br>
<br>Pakistan came into being on 14 August 1947: within a week the frontier Congress ministry of Dr Khan Sahib had been dismissed. Abdul Ghaffar Khan took the oath of allegiance to Pakistan as a member of the constituent assembly. The Khudai Khidmatgars had earlier severed their connections with the Indian Congress and replaced the tricolour with the red flag as their party symbol. But the authorities were inevitably suspicious of his continued championing of Pakhtunistan at a time of tension with neighbouring India and Afghanistan. In May 1948 he attempted to spread the Khudai Khidmatgars movement throughout Pakistan. Within a month he was arrested with his son Wali near Bahadur Khel in Kohat, on the charge of planning and fomenting open sedition against the state. The Khudai Khidmatgars were banned shortly afterwards. Ghaffar Khan was in fact to spend even longer periods of imprisonment in Pakistan than in British India.<br>
<br>He was first released in January 1954, but was again externed from the frontier. He attended the budget session of the constituent assembly in Karachi. The following year he headed the campaign against the merging of the provinces of West Pakistan into &#145;One Unit&#146;. This caused conflict with the authorities. It also led to a breach with Dr Khan Sahib, who in October 1955 became the chief minister of the newly integrated West Pakistan. After a brief spell in prison Abdul Ghaffar Khan joined Baluchi and Sindhi nationalists and left-leaning Punjabi and Bengali politicians to form the National Awami Party in 1957. It called for the dissolution of the One Unit scheme and demanded federal reorganization which would give greater regional autonomy. The National Awami Party's successful passage of a bill through the West Pakistan assembly which provided for the dissolution of the One Unit precipitated Pakistan's headlong descent to military take-over and the abrogation of the 1956 constitution. Abdul Ghaffar Khan was arrested in October 1958 along with other opposition leaders. He was released the following April on account of his age and poor health. But he was disqualified from being a member of any elected body and placed under restrictive orders. He defied these to tour the frontier and was subsequently rearrested in Dera Ismail Khan on 12 April 1961. His health deteriorated alarmingly as he languished in the familiar surroundings of Haripur prison. Shortly after his release in January 1964 he journeyed to England for medical treatment. During this time he stayed at the Sussex home of a former opponent, Sir Olaf Caroe, the one-time governor of the frontier.<br>
<br>Abdul Ghaffar Khan embarked on a lengthy self-imposed exile in Afghanistan in December 1964. His contention that the Durand line, which demarcated Pakistan's western frontier, was an imperialist legacy which artificially divided the Pakhtuns of Pakistan and Afghanistan assured him a warm welcome from the government, although his championing of the Pakhtuns was not well received by Afghanistan's ethnic minorities. He briefly visited India in November 1969 to receive the Nehru peace award. The formation of a National Awami Party government in the frontier in 1972 enabled him to return to Pakistan. A caravan of 6000 lorries escorted him from the Afghan border. Within two months the Bhutto regime had dismissed the frontier government and arrested Wali Khan and the other top National Awami Party leaders for anti-state activities. Abdul Ghaffar Khan was later arrested to prevent his returning to Afghanistan.<br>
<br>After the fall of Bhutto, General Zia ul Haq reversed the policy of repression. He dropped the Awami leaders' charges and released them. After some hesitation Abdul Ghaffar Khan was permitted to return to Afghanistan. For the next two years he shuttled between there and Pakistan. He again ran foul of the Pakistan authorities because he urged the refugees from the Soviet invasion to return home, and denied that the Afghan conflict was a <i>jihad</i> (holy war). In December 1985 he attended the Congress centenary celebrations in India, but was now increasingly frail. On 15 May 1987 he was admitted to hospital in Bombay, but was discharged a month later and travelled to Delhi, where he suffered a stroke on 4 July 1987. From then until his death he never fully recovered consciousness. He was taken by special plane from Delhi to Peshawar on 16 August 1987. After a bout of pneumonia, he died in Peshawar on the morning of 20 January 1988.<br>
<br>Abdul Ghaffar Khan's remarkable career was reflected in the events which surrounded his funeral. The Indian premier, Rajiv Gandhi, flew hurriedly to Peshawar to pay his respects. The governments of India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan each declared a period of official mourning. In accordance with his wishes, Abdul Ghaffar Khan was buried in war-torn Afghanistan. Around 15,000 mourners accompanied the body from Pakistan to its Jalalabad resting place, where they were joined by the beleaguered Afghan president, Dr Najibullah, and his cabinet colleagues.<br>
<br>Abdul Ghaffar Khan was held in such respect because of his sincerity and devotion to the ideal of non-violence. An intensely religious man who lived an austere life, he nevertheless acted as the secular conscience of the Indian subcontinent.<br>
