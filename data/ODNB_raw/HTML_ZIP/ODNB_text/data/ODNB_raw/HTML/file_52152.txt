<span class="headword">Kranich,  Burchard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Dr Burcot]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1578), <span class="occ">physician and mining entrepreneur</span>, came from southern Germany (&#145;High Almain&#146;); his name suggests that he was from Kronach, upper Franconia, near the mining area of the Erzgebirge. He is first heard of in &#145;The suit of Burghard touching the mines&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, no. 826), on 3 June 1553. The following year Kranich was licensed to prospect for, mine, and smelt any kinds of minerals in England. After being involved in lead-smelting in Derbyshire, he moved to Cornwall, being commissioned &#145;to dig &hellip; such mines of gold, silver and copper as he hath already &hellip; tried out&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1554&#150;6</i>, 211). He is credited with using the first water-wheel type hammers (&#145;stampers&#146;) in England. However, his Cornish mines were taken over, and for the years 1557&#150;9 he was granted protection from creditors, &#145;on account of certain causes &hellip; touching the king and queen and the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1555&#150;7</i>).<br>
<br>On 14 June 1561 Kranich was granted denization, and during 1562 was paid 100 marks (&pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.), with no reason given. In August, John Somers wrote that &#145;My Lady Marquis [the marchioness of Northampton] is in great danger by the jaundice. The physicians half despair, but Burcot, the Dutchman, at a pinch is like to do some good&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>). In October, Queen Elizabeth was taken ill with smallpox: the story of the insulted Kranich being threatened with a dagger before he would attend her is a later invention. The physician William Bullein made good-natured references to &#145;Dr Tocrub&#146;, while Gervase Markham's <span class="italic">The English Hus-Wife</span>  (5) attributed unspecified prescriptions to a manuscript (unidentified) of Kranich and Eliseus Bomelius.<br>
<br>Amid growing doubts, Kranich alone insisted that the ore brought home (1577&#150;8) by Martin Frobisher contained gold, and demanded for extracting it a daily wage of &pound;1, and &pound;200 pension&#151;without success. Kranich designed a new hearth, and&#151;someone said&#151;&#145;doctored&#146; the melt with gold and silver coins. In the event, the influential investors lost their money, and his reputation suffered.<br>
<br>In 1568 Kranich was said to adhere to the English church; the report, ten years later, that he had heard mass at a private house was probably untrue, and his will is in the protestant form. Kranich lived in St Clement's churchyard, just outside Temple Bar, in Westminster. On 20 September 1578 a Susan Burcott &#145;from Doctor Burcotts&#146; was buried at St Clement Danes: &#145;the death of a child of his&#146; hastened Kranich's end, William Fleetwood believed  (Hatfield House, Salisbury (Cecil) MSS, no. 660).<br>
<br>On 7 October 1578 Kranich, suffering from gout and infirmity, made his will, leaving his dwelling-house to his wife, who was to receive the proceeds from the sale of his Holborn properties, after payment of his debts. Following legacies to his servants and the poor, the residue, likewise, would go to his widow and executrix. By a codicil (19 October), his servant William Deane would have any proceeds over &pound;700 from the sale, and also his (unspecified) medical books and instruments; Kranich promised a silver-gilt bowl with a cover, given him by &#145;my Lord&#146;, to a friend.<br>
<br>Kranich died later that month, and was buried at St Clement Danes on 22 October 1578; probate was granted on 21 November to his widow, Agnes.<br>
