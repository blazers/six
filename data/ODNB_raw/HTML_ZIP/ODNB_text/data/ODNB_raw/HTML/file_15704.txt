<span class="headword">Hugessen,  Edward Hugessen  Knatchbull-</span>, first Baron Brabourne of Brabourne  (1829&#150;1893), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15702/', "Sir Edward Knatchbull, ninth baronet (1781&#150;1849)")</script>, of Mersham Hatch, Kent, where he was born on 29 April 1829. His mother, Fanny Catherine, daughter of Edward Knight of Godmersham Park, Kent, was a niece of Jane Austen. Knatchbull went to Eton College in 1844, and matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 9 July 1847. He graduated BA in 1851, and proceeded MA in 1854. His father died on 24 May 1849, having stated in his will his desire that his son should add to his surname the name Hugessen, after the testator's mother, Mary, daughter and coheir of William Western Hugessen of Provender, Kent. This was done by royal licence.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1857 Knatchbull-Hugessen was elected for Sandwich as a Liberal, with Lord Clarence Paget for a colleague. His maiden speech in the House of Commons was made on 21 April 1858 in support of the abolition of church rates. When Palmerston on 30 June 1859 formed his second administration he included Knatchbull-Hugessen in it as a lord of the Treasury (that is, as a whip). This office he filled until 1866, when he became under-secretary for the Home Office. In Gladstone's first administration, formed on 9 December 1868, Knatchbull-Hugessen returned to the under-secretaryship for the Home Office. In 1871 he became under-secretary for the colonies. On 24 March 1873 he was sworn of the privy council. He left office when Gladstone resigned on 13 February 1874. He moved away from Liberalism, especially on church questions and the establishment of the Church of England. He was not included in Gladstone's second administration, which was formed on 28 April 1880, but on 24 March in that year he had been created Baron Brabourne of Brabourne. Shortly after becoming a peer he became a Conservative and joined the Carlton Club. In 1882 he was a founder member of the Liberty and Property Defence League. He was chairman of the East Kent quarter sessions and deputy chairman of the South-Eastern Railway.<br>
<br>Brabourne was twice married, first, on 19 October 1852, to Anna Maria Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. May 1889), younger daughter of the Revd Marcus Richard Southwell, vicar of St Stephen's, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Cecilia Jane; this marriage produced two sons and two daughters. His second marriage was on 3 June 1890, at Maxwelton Chapel, Glencairn, to Ethel Mary (<i>d</i>. 1929), third daughter of Colonel George Gustavus Walker of Crawfordton, Dumfriesshire, and his wife, Anne Murray, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lennock, the marriage producing one son, Adrian (<i>b</i>. 1891), and a daughter, Alicia, who was born after Brabourne's death in 1893.<br>
<br>Before and after his elevation to the peerage Brabourne was an energetic author, chiefly known for numerous stories for children. He was also a book collector. An auction of part of his library, which &#145;abounded in topographical works, scarcely any English county being unrepresented&#146;, was held in May 1891, and the sum realized was over &pound;2000; a further auction of his collection was held in June 1893, following his death. After the death of his mother on 24 December 1882, in her ninetieth year, Brabourne became possessor of ninety-four letters written by his great-aunt, Jane Austen, to her elder sister, Cassandra. At the close of 1884 he published these letters in two volumes, with introductory and critical remarks, which were mainly notable for their diffuse irrelevance.<br>
<br>Brabourne wrote original fairy stories, the first of his many volumes being <span class="italic">Stories for my Children</span> (1869). Its opening tale, &#145;Puss Cat Mew&#146;, was later a favourite of J. R. R. Tolkien and may have provided some of the inspiration for characters in Tolkien's <span class="italic">The Lord of the Rings</span>. Brabourne claimed Hans Christian Andersen as his model, but his stories, though sometimes attractive, lack Andersen's skill and are &#145;often long-winded, macabre, and sadistic&#146;  (Carpenter and Prichard, 298). Brabourne also published a lecture on Oliver Cromwell (1877) and <span class="italic">Facts and Fictions in Irish History</span> (1886), attacking Gladstone. He died on 6 February 1893 at Smeeth Paddocks, and was buried at Smeeth, Kent, three days later.<br>
