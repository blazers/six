<span class="headword">Williams,  Joseph</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1663, <em>d.</em> in or after 1707), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was a performer of some distinction about whom few personal details survive. He has been speculatively identified as the son of the actor Walter Williams, and when he gave a deposition in chancery in October 1691, he was &#145;aged about 28 yeares&#146;, the only clue to his birth date. According to the prompter Downes, Williams joined the Duke's Company as a boy about 1673 and &#145;served Mr [Henry] Harris&#146;, the actor and co-director. (There is no evidence that, as some authorities state, he was apprenticed as a seal-cutter.) The presence of David Williams in the same company makes assignment of early roles uncertain. Joseph was probably Alcander in John Dryden and Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">Oedipus</span> (1678), which would be his first known role. He definitely played Troilus in John Banks's <span class="italic">Destruction of Troy</span> in November that year and Aeneas in Dryden's <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span> the following spring. About 1680 he took parts in John Crowne's <span class="italic">Misery of Civil War</span>, Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">Revenge</span>, Lawrence Maidwell's <span class="italic">The Loving Enemies</span>, and Nahum Tate's <span class="italic">The Loyal General</span>.<br>
<br>As early as 1680 Williams, then about seventeen, took such major roles as Polydore in Otway's <span class="italic">Orphan</span> and Bertran in Dryden's <span class="italic">Spanish Fryar</span>, a promising sign. He probably joined the United Company in November 1682 when the Duke's Company absorbed the King's, but revivals dominated the repertory, so there is no definite evidence of his participation until 1684, when he played Decius Brutus in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> and Alberto in Tate's <span class="italic">A Duke and No Duke</span>. He became a sharer in the United Company, probably when he turned twenty-one. Between 1684 and the actors' rebellion of 1695 Williams performed significant roles in both new and old plays. He was Sir Petronell Flash in Tate's <span class="italic">Cuckold's Haven</span> (1685), Captain Marine in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Commonwealth of Women</span> (1686), the King of Sicily in his fellow actor William Mountfort's <span class="italic">The Injur'd Lovers</span> (1688), the Duke of Guise in Lee's <span class="italic">Massacre of Paris</span> (1689), the title characters in Dryden's <span class="italic">Don Sebastian</span> (1689) and <span class="italic">Amphitryon</span> (1690), and the rake Wilding in Thomas Southerne's <span class="italic">The Wives Excuse</span> (1691). Luttrell records one of the few personal details known about Williams: on 18 March 1692 he killed &#145;Captain Hoard of the Provo&#146; in a duel  (Luttrell, 2.394). Absent from the stage for about six months, Williams may have been gaoled or gone into hiding.<br>
<br>Awaiting Williams when he returned were Vainlove in Congreve's <span class="italic">The Old Batchelour</span> (1693) and Mellefont in his <span class="italic">The Double-Dealer</span> (1694), Garcia in Dryden's last play, <span class="italic">Love Triumphant</span> (1694), and Biron in Southerne's <span class="italic">Fatal Marriage</span> (1694). The play <span class="italic">Have at All</span> was attributed to him in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Journal</span> of May 1694 but was never printed. In revivals he took such parts as Rains in Shadwell's <span class="italic">Epsom-Wells</span>, Lysimachus in Lee's <span class="italic">Rival Queens</span>, and Cassio in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Othello</span>. In December 1694 Williams signed the &#145;petition of the players&#146; to the lord chamberlain against the management of Christopher Rich (preserved in TNA: PRO, LC 7/3). The &#145;reply of the patentees&#146; states that his salary had been &pound;3 per week prior to 1692, but that he demanded and received &pound;4 a week when he returned to the company. Williams is named among the actor&#150;sharers in the licence granted by the lord chamberlain in March 1695 to the rebel troupe opening at Lincoln's Inn Fields, but, not liking the terms offered, he chose to stay at Drury Lane. One immediate result was that the lead role of Valentine in Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, written for Williams, had to be taken by the sixty-year-old Betterton.<br>
<br>At Drury Lane, Williams was useful to a young and hard-pressed company, taking such parts as the Lieutenant-Governor in Southerne's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span> (1695), the Elder Worthy in Cibber's <span class="italic">Love's Last Shift</span> (1696), Valerius Asiaticus in Crowne's <span class="italic">Caligula</span>, and the dashing Roebuck in Farquhar's <span class="italic">Love and a Bottle</span> (1698). For the season of 1699&#150;1700 he appears to have defected to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he is listed as Pylades in John Dennis's <span class="italic">Iphigenia</span>, but the shift cost him a role in the most popular play of the era, Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Constant Couple</span>, and signals a downturn in his career. A year later he was back at Drury Lane, playing Constant in Mrs Trotter's <span class="italic">Love at a Loss</span>. He remained there the rest of his career. Though his presence is thinly recorded, he still won some important roles, among them the Archduke of Austria in Trotter's <span class="italic">Unhappy Penitent</span> (1701), Gainlove in Richard Wilkinson's <span class="italic">Vice Reclaim'd</span> (1703), Hannibal in Cibber's <span class="italic">Perolla and Izadora</span> (1705), Woolfort in Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Royal Merchant</span>, and the Tsar in their <span class="italic">Loyal Subject</span>. Williams's last known new part was Worthy in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> in April of 1706. He shared a benefit on 22 April 1707, but whether he performed at that time is unclear, nor is anything known about him thereafter.<br>
<br>If not quite of the first rank, Joseph Williams was a talented actor who excelled in comedy, exhibiting a considerable range in his parts. In tragedy he was useful, though not powerful enough to carry a play himself. Cibber judged that the rebel actors erred badly in refusing Williams full sharer status in 1695, but admitted that his &#145;Industry &hellip; was not equal to his Capacity &hellip; he lov'd his Bottle better than his Business&#146;  (Cibber, 1.200). Williams had great innate capacity, was well trained, and enjoyed considerable early success, but his career never fulfilled his promise.<br>
