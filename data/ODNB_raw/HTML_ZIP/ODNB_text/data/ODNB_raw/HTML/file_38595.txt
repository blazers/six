<span class="headword">Macpherson,  Robert</span>  (1814&#150;1872), <span class="occ">photographer and painter</span>, was born in Forfarshire, Scotland, probably on 27 February 1814, and spent most of his professional life in Rome. Little is known of his family background, though it is likely that he was a grandnephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17728/', "James Macpherson (1736&#150;1796)")</script>, author of the fraudulent Ossianic publication, <span class="italic">Fragments of Ancient Poetry</span> (1760). The generally accepted view of his early life is that he studied medicine at Edinburgh University (1831&#150;5) and later&#151;possibly about 1838&#151;attended classes at the Royal Scottish Academy of Art. Towards the end of the 1830s he left Scotland for India with the intention of practising as a surgeon; for health reasons, however, he settled in Rome, abandoning his career in medicine to become a painter.<br>
<br>Only moderately successful as an artist, Macpherson found it necessary to undertake freelance work as a journalist, producing articles for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. He also practised as a dealer in antiquities and was responsible for the discovery of Michelangelo's <span class="italic">Entombment of Christ</span>, which he retained as a hedge against financial difficulties, eventually selling it in 1868 to the National Gallery in London for &pound;2000. Gregarious and outgoing, he became a central figure in the community of expatriate artists and intellectuals who congregated in Rome in mid-century, with the sculptor James Gibson and the German painter Peter von Cornelius among his personal friends. In appearance he was the quintessential Scotsman abroad, with flaming red hair, large flowing beard, and full highland costume. In 1847 he became a Roman Catholic, and in the following year fell in love with Gerardine (Geddie) Bate (1830/31&#150;1878) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59015/', "Macpherson, Gerardine")</script>], the niece and prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of the renowned art historian Anna Jameson, with whom she had travelled to Rome in the company of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Despite her aunt's disapproval, the couple were married on 4 September 1849 in Ealing, Middlesex, Geddie Macpherson converting to Catholicism the following year.<br>
<br>In 1851 Macpherson began experimenting in photography, which he found to be a more lucrative profession than painting. He quickly established himself as one of the leading interpreters of Roman topography, producing nearly 300 views of the city's architectural treasures, as well as numerous reproductions of paintings and sculptures from the papal collections in the Vatican. He used both the albumen and collodion processes, often combining the two, with glass negatives measuring 30.5 centimetres by 40.5, and exposure times varying from two minutes to several days. He also experimented with photolithography, which he tried, without success, to use commercially. Although his work was produced chiefly for sale to the burgeoning tourist trade, it was also regularly included in major exhibitions in London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. In 1858 he contributed 120 prints to the exhibition of the Architectural Photographic Association. His earlier experience as a painter proved invaluable in the choice of effective viewpoints, and his interpretations of classical architecture were unsurpassed in their aesthetic power and sophistication.<br>
<br>Unlike many of his major rivals, such as the Alinari brothers, Macpherson's commercial activities never grew beyond the scale of a small family business, with many of the practical tasks such as printing and mounting often performed by his wife and mother-in-law. His book <span class="italic">Vatican Sculptures</span> (1863) was also illustrated with woodcuts by his wife. From about 1865 his career began to falter, and the last years of his life were marked by a steady decline in both his reputation and his health. He died in Rome on 17 November 1872, leaving his wife and their four surviving children, William, Francis, Ada, and Joseph, in a state of acute financial distress. He was buried in the churchyard of San Lorenzo, Rome.<br>
