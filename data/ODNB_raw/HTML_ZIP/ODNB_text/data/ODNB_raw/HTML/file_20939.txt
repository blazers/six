<span class="headword">Otthen,  Hippocrates</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1611), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was related to the noble family of Otthens in Alsace, but was educated and became doctor of medicine at the University of Montpellier, France. He came to England with his father, the emperor's physician, who had been summoned by Elizabeth I. Pressed into the service of the earl of Leicester, &#145;who desired him to pertain unto him&#146;  (Stow, 4.113), he continued in the latter's service for many years, both at home and in the Low Countries. He was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians on 4 July 1589, being described as &#145;vir doctus et practicator bonus&#146; (&#145;a learned man and good practitioner&#146;). On the death of Leicester he entered the service of the earl of Essex, and, by Elizabeth's command, attended him in the wars of France and the expedition to Cadiz. After his return to England he was ordered by Elizabeth to attend Lord Mountjoy, later earl of Devonshire, in Ireland. He subsequently accompanied, in the same capacity of physician, the earl of Hertford, the English ambassador to the archduke of Austria. The rest of his life was spent in private practice.<br>
<br>On either 16 March 1605 or 12 June 1609 Otthen was incorporated DM at Oxford. He married Dorothy, a daughter of Roger Drew of Densworth in Sussex, and spent his last years with her &#145;in great bliss and happiness&#146;  (Stow, 4.113). He died on 13 November 1611 and was buried in the church of St Clement Danes, London, where a monument, with inscription, was erected to his memory on the south side of the chancel. After his death his wife married Sir Stephen Thornhurst of Kent, and died on 12 June 1620, aged fifty-five. She was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, where a monument was erected to her memory.<br>
