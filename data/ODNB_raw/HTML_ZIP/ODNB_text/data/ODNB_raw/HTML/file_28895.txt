<span class="headword">Watts,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1649), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, the son of William Watts, was born in Tibbenham, Norfolk. He attended school at Moulton and was admitted as a sizar to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1606. He graduated BA in 1611 and proceeded MA three years later. He was appointed chaplain of St Sepulchre's, Cambridge, in 1615, was vicar of St Peter's between 1615 and 1617, became chaplain and a fellow of his college in 1616, and was incorporated at Oxford in July 1618. In December 1620 he acted as chaplain to Sir Albertus Morton on his mission to deliver &pound;30,000 to the protestant princes of Germany. In 1624 Watts became vicar of Barwick, Norfolk, and the following year was also appointed rector of St Alban, Wood Street, London, apparently as a result of the patronage he enjoyed from the provost of Eton. In 1626 he resigned his fellowship and married, on 21 February in Canterbury Cathedral, Dorothy Vaughan, the daughter of a Surrey clergyman.<br>
<br>Watts's first published work, a translation, <span class="italic">St Augustines Confessions</span> (1631), was dedicated to Lord Keeper Thomas Coventry's daughter Elizabeth, Lady Hare of Stow, Norfolk. It was, he claimed, &#145;the hardest taske that ever I yet undertooke&#146;  (A5<i>r</i>); uncontroversial marginal notes included classical, biblical, and historical references. Between 1632 and 1634 he produced nearly twenty issues of a serial publication, <span class="italic">The Swedish Intelligencer</span>, which eulogized &#145;that Caesar and Alexander of our times&#146;, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. According to Anthony Wood, Watts's <span class="italic">Mortification Apostolicall</span> (1637), dedicated to Sir Henry Wotton, provost of Eton and to a number of its fellows, &#145;his ever honored patrones&#146;, gave great offence to puritans. The continental scholar Gerard Vossius praised Watts's edition of Matthew Paris's <span class="italic">Accesserunt duorum offarum</span> (1638).<br>
<br>Watts was made a prebendary of Wells in 1633 and awarded a DD degree in 1639. In February that year he was appointed a chaplain-extraordinary and in August a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king. He was also serving as chaplain to Lord Arundel, the commander of the invasion of Scotland. On his return to England in 1642 Charles I made Watts chaplain to Prince Rupert, whom he subsequently accompanied in &#145;all the battles which he fought with the parliamenteers&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.383). As a result of his presence in the royalist army, in March 1643 he was removed from the parish of St Alban and his wife and family were temporarily homeless. On 19 May the committee for sequestrations ordered the seizure of his goods, worth about &pound;129; an allowance to his family from their sale was ordered by the House of Commons on 29 June. In 1645 Watts was appointed archdeacon of Wells, but he never took possession of the post. He seems to have held the vicarage of Barwick until 1648.<br>
<br>Watts wrote a treatise on the surplice, &#145;The church's linen garment&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 262), and he may also have written two manuscript accounts of Prince Rupert's exploits during the 1640s, subsequently reproduced in B. E. G. Warburton, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Prince Rupert and the Cavaliers</span> (1849). In 1649 he travelled with Rupert's navy to Kinsale in Ireland, where he became ill and died about December that year. He was buried in Kinsale. His wife survived him.<br>
