<span class="headword">Ker, Sir  Thomas, of Ferniehirst</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1586), <span class="occ">border chieftain and administrator</span>, was the second son of Sir John Ker (<i>d</i>. 1562), laird of Ferniehirst, and his wife, Katherine Ker of Cessford. Thomas inherited the Ferniehirst estates on his father's death in 1562 and married Janet Kirkcaldy of Grange around the same time. They had five surviving children&#151;Andrew, first Lord Jedburgh; William Kirkcaldy of Grange (who succeeded to his mother's lands and took her surname); Mary, who married James Douglas, commendator of Melrose; Julian, married first to Sir Patrick Home of Polwarth and then to Thomas Hamilton, first earl of Haddington; and Margaret, who wed Robert, second Lord Melville. By 1569 Janet had died, and in that year Sir Thomas married Janet Scott, sister of Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch. The match represented an attempt to pacify a blood feud between the Kers and Scotts, and despite its shaky origins proved a success. Janet bore Sir Thomas three more sons and a daughter&#151;Thomas of Oxnam; Mr James (whose son Robert became second Lord Jedburgh); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4754/', "Robert Carr or Ker, earl of Somerset")</script>, the infamous favourite of James VI and I; and Anne, who in 1583 was noted as a possible bride for the sixth earl of Huntly, but who eventually married John Elphinstone, second Lord Balmerino.<br>
<br>Thomas Ker is first recorded as a hostage for his grandfather, Andrew (Dand) Ker of Ferniehirst, during the &#145;rough wooing&#146; of the 1540s. In December 1544 Dand thanked the earl of Shrewsbury for sending &#145;Thome&#146; to school in England. This education perhaps accounts for Thomas's being noted as a protestant when he brought a preacher to Kelso in 1553. In 1560, when the Scottish Reformation began in earnest, John Knox noted him as &#145;godly and forward&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 1.261). Ferniehirst continued to support the Reformation, but had returned to Roman Catholicism by the mid 1560s through the influence of Mary, queen of Scots. Ker had to run the family estates after his father's death in 1562 and may have had less time for religious activities. His renewed adherence to Roman Catholicism was concrete, rather than <i>politique</i>, for in October 1582 the general assembly of the Church of Scotland wanted to &#145;call before them the Laird of Pharnihirst, his ladie and daughter for going to Mess in France&#146; in order to force them to subscribe the protestant confession of faith  (<span class="italic">Booke of the Universall Kirk</span>, 589).<br>
<br>Ferniehirst continued his family's feud with the Scotts and was consequently summoned before the privy council in November 1562. Nevertheless he was knighted about this time. In 1568 he made a will because he feared an imminent attack by Scott of Buccleuch, but his marriage to Janet Scott calmed these tensions for a while. In the political sphere Ker defended the newly wed Queen Mary against the rebellious forces of the earl of Moray during the 1565 chaseabout raid. Thereafter he never left the queen's cause and after her escape from Lochleven Castle in 1568 he rejoined her forces; he could not, however, prevent their defeat at Langside and Mary's subsequent flight into exile. The queen then corresponded with Ker as if she were still in power, advising him to keep good order and give ready service when it was required. On 26 August 1569 Mary wrote that she hoped to deliver her next message to him in person. The failure of the 1569&#150;70 northern rising must have been a great disappointment to Sir Thomas, who sheltered the rebel earl of Westmorland and his followers at Ferniehirst Castle. The English had their revenge when the forces of the earl of Sussex and Lord Hunsdon launched a two-pronged attack on the houses of those who had abetted the rebels; Ferniehirst Castle was razed to the ground during April 1570.<br>
<br>More disaster followed when Ker gave his support to the &#145;queen's party&#146;, which opposed the &#145;king's party&#146; during the civil wars of 1570&#150;73. This was a time of confused government, with rival parliaments meeting during 1571. Marians holding Edinburgh Castle elected Ferniehirst provost of Edinburgh on 20 June 1571; he was subsequently forfeited by the king's men on 28 August 1571 at Stirling. Now labelled a firebrand, he took part in the attack by the queen's men on the rival parliament. During this sortie into Stirling, the regent Lennox, grandfather of James VI, was killed, an eventuality which made a restoration of Ferniehirst's estates unlikely. Ker continued to cause trouble in 1572 by leading an attack on Jedburgh because that town had backed his territorial rival, the earl of Angus.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas then joined his father-in-law, Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, in defending Edinburgh Castle against the English-backed forces of Regent Morton and the king's men. The Marian defenders surrendered in May 1573, yet just before this capitulation Ferniehirst escaped from the castle and went into England to shelter with his friend Sir John Forster, warden of the English middle march. The English privy council ordered Forster to keep him there to prevent his going to France. After Forster had entered a submission on Ferniehurst's behalf, Morton denounced the latter's character, saying he had &#145;never heard of any submission of Ferniehurst that in honour or reason could be thought worthy of an answer&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1572&#150;4</i>, 300). Ker returned briefly to Scotland in November 1573 to survey English damage to his properties near Jedburgh. He then complained to Forster that Jedburgh's burghers and Morton's soldiers did &#145;daily cut and destroy his woods, harass his tenants, and slay his deer&#146;  (ibid., 439). Sir Thomas did not mention that he had attacked Morton's lands in 1570&#150;71. By September 1574 he was still in Forster's company as he appeared with other rebels at a border &#145;day of truce&#146;, where they conferred with fellow Scottish borderers.<br>
<br>Morton was furious and by December 1574 had ensured that the forfeiture of Ferniehirst's lands was absolute by granting most of them to the earl of Angus. Ferniehirst travelled to France and remained there until the downfall of Morton in 1581. His debts mounted as he borrowed money from such people as Sir John Forster and Sir Cuthbert Collingwood of Eslington in England, his aunt Dame Isobel Ker of Cessford, John Angus, a Scottish merchant in Paris, and James Beaton, erstwhile archbishop of Glasgow, who was similarly exiled in France. Whether these debts were ever repaid is unclear. Ferniehirst hoped that Queen Mary would repay Beaton, but during 1583&#150;4 Collingwood resorted to demanding his money from Dame Janet Scott as Ferniehirst's factor. Dame Janet was trying to alleviate her husband's debts in France and Scotland by asking Queen Mary to chase up the Spanish pension he had been promised. In an intriguing correspondence Mary sent a ring to Lady Ferniehirst, who reciprocated by sending back political news from Scotland.<br>
<br>Ker had been licensed to return from France in 1580 probably through the influence of the earl of Lennox and an offer of manrent to Regent Morton. That offer was quickly abandoned on the downfall of Morton, at whose execution on 2 June 1581 Ferniehirst &#145;stood in a shott over against the scaffold, with his large ruffes, delyting in this spectacle&#146;  (Calderwood, 3.575). Later that year Ferniehirst was pardoned for all crimes committed between June 1567 and November 1574 and fully restored to his estates; ratification followed in 1583. He was appointed provost of Jedburgh on the king's command in 1581, in order to oust pro-Angus officials in the burgh, while in 1582 the hereditary office of baillie of Jedforest was returned to him upon the forfeiture of the earl of Angus. Ferniehirst was in such great favour in 1582 that he was also granted a five-year protection from all his creditors.<br>
<br>Ferniehirst returned to France in 1582 to avoid the regime of the protestant Ruthven raiders, who had ousted his patron the earl of Lennox. But he returned to Scotland in 1584 and allied himself with the new chancellor of Scotland, the fifth earl of Arran. His first victim was his old rival William Ker of Cessford, whom he unfairly engineered out of the office of warden of the Scottish middle march. His appointment as warden had disastrous consequences, however, when in July 1585 Lord Francis Russell was killed in mysterious circumstances during a day of truce between Ferniehirst and Sir John Forster. David Hume of Godscroft noted that &#145;whether by chance or of set purpose is uncertain&#146;  (Hume, 402). The blame was nevertheless placed on Ferniehirst, with Arran as his suspected accomplice. As Russell had been Forster's son-in-law, the incident also strained Anglo-Scottish relations.<br>
<br>Ferniehirst had many men with him, but they were not &#145;ranged in order of battell&#146; as later reports suggested. He was, after all, a pompous man known to like a large garrison around him, and Arran had given him twenty-five hagbutters to carry out his warden duties. Russell was &#145;slaine in the myddest of his owne men&#146;, which suggests a prearranged murder plot. However after the murder both Forster and Ferniehirst &#145;stood together and made a quietnes&#146;, and then took order over pledges and prisoners and &#145;parted quietly oute of the feeld&#146;  (Bain, 1, nos. 330&#150;31). James VI warded both Arran and Ferniehirst and refused to hand Ferniehirst over to the English government. There may have been some enmity between Ferniehirst and Russell as Russell had been intercepting his letters. Russell had called him half lunatic in May 1585, perhaps in response to his arrogance. Ferniehirst swore that he &#145;would rather the blood of one of his own friends had been shed&#146;, but in truth his reputation was shattered by this incident, one that still remains an enigma  (TNA: PRO, IND1/6887).<br>
<br>Ferniehirst's fall from power caused his wife to return from France in 1585; she lived until the mid-1590s. Meanwhile, on 24 February 1586 Henry Widdrington of the Berwick garrison recorded that &#145;Sir Thomas Carre the lard of Farnihearst is deceased in the towne of Aberdene&#146;  (Bain, 1, no. 417). Still grieving for his son-in-law, Sir John Forster wrote &#145;I am sorie that he and some betters had not beine hanged&#146;  (ibid., 1, no. 421). This was an ignominious end for a man who had once been a powerful border laird and supporter of Queen Mary.<br>
