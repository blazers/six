<span class="headword">Payne,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1593), <span class="occ">writer on agriculture and entrepreneur</span>, probably came from Nottinghamshire. Nothing is known of his family or his early life. He was the author of a single folio containing miscellaneous information for farmers and landowners, <span class="italic">The Vale Mans Table: Herein is Taught &hellip; howe to Drain Moores</span>, dated 16 November 1583. Payne adopts a jovial tone, acknowledging that some might mock his efforts, but asserting that his methods are fail-safe, dispensing advice on how to measure woods from a distance, use a compass, drain bogs and wet moors, as well as providing a table of years from the reign of William the Conqueror onwards. There is also a poem which criticizes ineffective citizens who let ground lie fallow and fail to benefit their fellows, and a plea that the work be sold at 6<i>d</i>., not 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., as Payne had discovered booksellers charging, indicating that there may have been an earlier edition. Payne gives his address as Paines End.<br>
<br>Payne was patronized by Sir Francis Willoughby in the late 1580s and was engaged in projects to grow woad and produce jersey wool for stockings in Nottinghamshire. It was probably through Willoughby's connections with Phane Becher, a London businessman who had settled in Cork, that Payne was sent over to Munster with a view to preparing the way for twenty-five of his neighbours to follow afterwards. Payne obtained a freehold of 600 acres on the Munster plantation and began to investigate the possibility of establishing an ironworks in Kinalmeaky, which would have been overseen by an English manager, and would have used the woods that Willoughby had bought in the area. Payne appears not to have been the most scrupulous of businessmen and there was friction between him and Willoughby over the stockings project.<br>
<br>Payne's most significant work, a treatise entitled <span class="italic">A brife description of Ireland, made in this yeere 1589, by Robert Payne, unto xxv of his partners, for whom he is undertaker there</span> (1589), may have been written to entice his fellow workers in Nottingham to join in a similar project in Ireland. Payne's short treatise is a piece of colonialist propaganda designed to persuade English men and women that life in Ireland was better than they could expect in England. It was perhaps modelled on the example of Thomas Harriot's <span class="italic">Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia</span> (1588), which had served a similar purpose (Harriot was included in the census of the plantation on 12 May 1589). Nevertheless it contains many useful and probably accurate eyewitness observations of Irish life, schools, agriculture, diet, society, and town life. There is also an important reference to the influence of Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas's writings in the British Isles. The <span class="italic">Brife Description</span> was evidently popular enough to be reprinted with some additions in 1590. Payne gives his address as his house at &#145;Poynes-End&#146;.<br>
<br>Payne was made agent for Becher in Kinalmeaky in 1590, but was dismissed in 1591 when faulty accounts and other financial irregularities were discovered. In 1592 he was imprisoned in London at the behest of Phane Becher, and died in 1593.<br>
