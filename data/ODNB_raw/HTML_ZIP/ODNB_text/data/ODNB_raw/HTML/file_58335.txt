<span class="headword">Irons,  Evelyn Graham</span>  (1900&#150;2000), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 17 June 1900 at 136 Hyndland Road, Kelvinside, Glasgow, the daughter of Joseph Jones Irons, stockbroker, and his wife, Edith Mary Latta. Her middle-class family possibly had connections with the Grahams of Montrose, and she was descended from Henry Bell, developer of steam navigation. She was educated at St Bride's School, Helensburgh, and at Somerville College, Oxford (1918&#150;21), where she was awarded a second-class degree in English and was a skilled canoeist.<br>
<br>Evelyn Irons had an early ambition to be a writer and moved to London to work in a bookshop. In 1927 she became the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>'s fashion correspondent for the women's page despite her characteristic rejection of cosmetics. She was a handsome and well-dressed woman with an open face and swept-back short hair. She became editor of the feature page by 1931 and was living in Chelsea with Olive Rinder when she interviewed Radclyffe Hall for an article entitled &#145;How other women run their homes&#146;. She and Olive became part of Hall's circle, Hall and her partner, Una Troubridge, admiring the &#145;marriage&#146; between Evelyn and Olive. In 1931 Irons was made editor of the women's page, and in March of that year interviewed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35903/', "Victoria Mary (Vita) Sackville-West (1892&#150;1962)")</script>. She fell &#145;desperately in love&#146; with Vita, who returned her feelings. The love poems in her <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span> that Sackville-West wrote in 1931 are addressed to Evelyn Irons, to whom she dedicated the entire collection. Olive Rinder, who &#145;actively encouraged&#146;  (Glendinning, 240) Irons's relationship with Sackville-West, was herself in love with Vita. The three entered into an uneasy m&eacute;nage that culminated in a disastrous holiday in Cornwall, after which Irons put an end to both relationships. Vita had been extravagant both emotionally and materially, and once gave Evelyn a suitcase full of men's pyjamas, but she could be possessive and jealous. Though Vita was stung by Evelyn's desertion and sent her a poem, &#145;Valediction&#146;, they remained in touch until Vita's death. Olive moved into a cottage near Sissinghurst. On 14 July 1931 Evelyn Irons met Joy McSweeney (<i>d</i>. 1978) at a party, and spent the rest of her life with her. Four years later she saved McSweeney from drowning, for which she received the rare distinction of the Stanhope gold medal from the Royal Humane Society.<br>
<br>In 1935 Irons joined the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, where she edited the women's pages until the outbreak of the Second World War. She worked for the air raid patrol and the London fire service, and transferred herself to the news desk on the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>, announcing to the unsuspecting chief news editor that she was now working for him. She managed to secure herself an assignment with a division of the free French forces under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, with whom she formed a close professional relationship throughout the war. With the Premi&egrave;re Arm&eacute;e Fran&ccedil;aise, Irons entered Germany with Charles de Gaulle early in 1945 as the only accredited British correspondent. She was the first woman to be awarded the croix de guerre, for her part in the French seizure of a Bavarian village. As she recalled it, she &#145;somehow had got ahead of the advance, and four of us in a jeep came to this village and found no allied troops had arrived. So we took it ourselves&#146;  (interview, in Knightley, 346). She was also probably the first female correspondent to reach Eagle's Nest&#151;Hitler's summer retreat at Berchtesgaden&#151;in 1945; she reported triumphantly that she had sampled Hitler's &#145;excellent Rhine wine&#146;. She also secured an interview with Rudolf Hess's wife, Ilse, in a French prison.<br>
<br>After the war Irons continued at the news desk. In 1952 Lord Beaverbrook sent her to the United States to report on Eisenhower's presidential campaign. Having known very little about the subject she became so attuned to American politics that she was asked to stay on. She based herself in New York, settling in Brewster, and reported on a number of significant events. In 1954 she discovered the whereabouts of Edward Montagu, Michael Pitt-Rivers, and the marquess of Milford Haven after they had fled from Britain following an infamous homosexual trial. She was holidaying in Hungary with Joy McSweeney in 1956 when the revolution began, and had to cut short a house party to attend the wedding of Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller. She was one of the few reporters to break the United States news embargo on the Guatemalan revolution of 1957. Leaving many of her male colleagues languishing in a bar in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, she used rudimentary Spanish to hire a donkey and a guide to transport her through guerrilla-occupied jungle to the Guatemalan border. Her only worry was what Beaverbrook would say when she claimed expenses for the donkey.<br>
<br>From 1959 Evelyn Irons worked for the London <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, and stayed with the paper until she retired. Having enjoyed tending the grounds of Sissinghurst with Vita Sackville-West, she was a keen gardener, cultivating English roses in her wild riverside home in Brewster. She also had a holiday home in Skiathos. After Joy McSweeney's death in 1978 she learned to drive. Having been in good health until her late nineties, she died in Brewster on 3 April 2000, two months before her 100th birthday.<br>
