<span class="headword">Owen,  James</span>  (1654&#150;1706), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was born on 1 November 1654 at the farmhouse of Bryn in the parish of Aber-nant, Carmarthenshire, the second son of John Owen. His grandfather had served in the royalist forces during the civil war and his parents were strongly attached to episcopacy but their nine children all became nonconformists. His brother David (<i>d</i>. 1710) was a protestant dissenting minister in Henllan, Carmarthenshire. His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20987/', "Charles Owen")</script>, was minister to the protestant dissenters in Warrington, Lancashire, for fifty years until his death in 1746.<br>
<br>After passing through a county school Owen was allegedly grounded in the classics at Carmarthen Castle by James Picton, a Quaker, before progressing to Carmarthen grammar school. About 1670 he took a course of philosophy under Samuel Jones (1628&#150;1697) of Brynllywarch, near Bridgend, Glamorgan, and presumably received instruction in languages as he was an accomplished linguist in later life, with knowledge of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Saxon, and French. His first deep religious convictions had been received about 1668 from a nonconformist preacher. He looked forward to the ministry but was undecided about conforming. After acting as a tutor he spent some time with his godfather, the clergyman James Howell, who did his best to remove his scruples. Howell was the nephew of James Howell (1594?&#150;1666), also from Aber-nant, the author of <span class="italic">Epistolae Ho-elianae</span>. However, Owen decided for nonconformity and placed himself with Stephen Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1688), ejected from Meidrim, Carmarthenshire, and afterwards congregational minister at Swansea, who had a great reputation for training preachers. Owen's preaching attracted the notice of the ecclesiastical courts and on the advice of Henry Maurice (<i>d</i>. 1682) of Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, he moved to north Wales, where he settled at Bodfel, near Pwllheli, Caernarvonshire. After nine months' work there his position became unsafe. Travelling by night he made his way to Hugh Owen (<i>d</i>. 1699) at Bronclydwr, Merioneth, and then preached as his assistant for some time.<br>
<br>In November 1676 Owen became chaplain to Mrs Baker of Sweeny, just south of Oswestry, Shropshire, and at about the same time took charge of the nonconformist congregation founded at Oswestry by Roland Nevet (<i>d</i>. 1675) the ejected vicar. He was set apart for the ministry in October 1677. On 17 November 1679 he married Sarah George (<i>d</i>. 1692); they had seven children, two of whom survived him. From Oswestry he conducted a north Wales mission, having a monthly lecture at Ruthin, Denbighshire. In 1681 William Lloyd (1627&#150;1717), then the bishop of St Asaph, challenged Owen to a public debate on ordination, demanding an account of &#145;by what right he exercised the ministry, not having episcopal ordination&#146;  (Henry, <span class="italic">Life of Philip Henry</span>, 153)&#151;&#145;The Grand Question propos'd and discuss'd was Whether Ordination by Such Diocesans as have uninterrupted Succession of Canonical Ordination down from the Apostles, be so necessary that Churches and Ministry are null without it?&#146;  (C. Owen, 31). The defence of presbyterian ordination was to become the cause for which Owen would subsequently enter into print and engage in controversy.<br>
<br>After the 1689 <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, Owen removed his Ruthin lecture to Denbigh, and set up others at Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire, and Wrexham, Denbighshire. He had great difficulty in getting his meeting-places licensed and was often disturbed. In 1690 he started an academy for training students for the ministry at Oswestry. He was supported from London by the Common Fund with &pound;8 in 1690 for Oswestry, reduced to &pound;5 in 1695 and continued until 1699. He educated his younger brother Charles, whose <span class="italic">Some Account of the Life of &hellip; James Owen</span> is an invaluable account of life in the academy. After the death of Sarah in 1692 Owen married in 1693 his second wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1699), widow of Alderman R. Edwards of Oswestry.<br>
<br>About 1696 Owen seems to have begun an association with the Lancashire provincial assembly and Cheshire classis. The Cheshire classis had been due to receive a sermon from Philip Henry in August 1696 but this was cut short by Henry's death. On 11 August 1696 Owen preached in Henry's stead to the thirty assembled ministers. During the sitting of the classis the protestant dissenters of Warrington sent representatives to obtain a minister. The classis recommended Charles Owen, who was ministering in Wrexham. The Wrexham congregation agreed &#145;adhaering there to Mr James Owen as their fixed Pastor, and looking upon his brother Mr Charles but as his assistant&#146;  (Gordon, 21&#150;2). Charles Owen first attended the general meeting of ministers in Lancashire at Bolton on 13 April 1697 and at the next general meeting in Warrington on 10 August 1697 James and John Owen &#145;Out of Wales&#146; were in attendance. In 1696 and again in 1699 James Owen was invited as assistant to John Chorlton at Cross Street Chapel, Manchester. He declined and early in 1700 he became minister of High Street Chapel, Shrewsbury, as co-pastor with Francis Tallents. After the death of Jane in 1699, on 12 August 1700 he married his third wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Wynne, of Coparleni, Flintshire, and widow of John Hough of Chester. He continued his academy at Shrewsbury and kept up his lecturing in north Wales.<br>
<br>The year 1696 seems to have been a pivotal point in Owen's career. He was drawn closer to the ministerial assemblies in Lancashire and Cheshire while his publications drew him deeper into religio-political controversy, particularly with Thomas Gipps, the rector of Bury, Lancashire. The two developments are not disconnected, with John Chorlton of Manchester playing a critical role in promoting Owen as a champion of dissent against the high Anglican party in Manchester.<br>
<br>In the late 1680s and early 1690s Owen published works in Welsh, including a translation of the assembly's shorter catechism, and entered into controversy with the Baptist Benjamin Keach over infant baptism. In 1694 he went into print with <span class="italic">A Plea for Scripture Ordination</span>, his defence of ordination by presbyters which contained a preface by Daniel Williams. He was answered by Gipps with <span class="italic">Tentamen novum</span> (1696) which defends Timothy and Titus as diocesan rulers. Owen replied to this with <span class="italic">Tutamen evangelicum</span> (1697) in which he maintained that Gipps's arguments would unchurch all the continental Reformed churches that lacked bishops, churches that were explicitly recognized in the articles of the Church of England. Gipps responded with <span class="italic">A Sermon Against Corrupting the Word</span> (1697) in which he accused the dissenters of substituting &#145;ye for we, in <span class="roman">Acts</span> 6:3 in the year 1638&#146; in support of the popular election of ministers  (C. Owen, 106). Owen replied with <span class="italic">Remarks on a Sermon</span> (1697), a work in which Gipps perceived the hand of Chorlton assisting Owen. This bitter exchange rumbled on until 1699 with Gipps going into print a further four times on the subject and Owen twice.<br>
<br>Having antagonized the Manchester high Anglicans, Owen achieved national attention with the publication of his defence of occasional conformity entitled <span class="italic">Moderation a Virtue</span> (1703). In it he argued that &#145;Jesus Christ, the author of our Holy Religion, was also an Occasional Conformist; a Dissenter from the imposed ceremonies of the Elders: Preach'd in private Houses, and separate Congregations&#146;  (C. Owen, 108). Against a background of repeated attempts between 1702 and 1704 to pass laws against occasional conformity, its effect was incendiary and did nothing to quell high Anglican fears of the &#145;Church in Danger&#146;. Daniel Defoe engaged with Owen's arguments in his <span class="italic">The Sincerity of the Dissenters Vindicated</span> (1703) and <span class="italic">The Dissenters Answer</span> (1704) and Owen was attacked by William Hogden and Charles Leslie in 1704. He provided a further anonymous defence in 1704 with <span class="italic">Moderation Still a Virtue</span>, in which he also defended ordination by presbyters, vindicated the dissenting academies and condemned Henry Sacheverell. He published other works against organ worship (1700) and the practice of consecrating buildings (1706) and published a translation of the Huguenot John Delme's <span class="italic">Method of Good Preaching</span> (1701). The account of the Welsh ejected ministers in Edmund Calamy's <span class="italic">Account</span> is by Owen. But the strain of spending a decade defending the dissenting interest proved too much. For thirty years he had suffered from gallstones and he died of the disorder on 8 April 1706. His funeral sermon was preached by Matthew Henry and he was buried at St Chad's, Shrewsbury on 11 April. His portrait is prefixed to the biography by his brother Charles, who brought out many of his works posthumously.<br>
