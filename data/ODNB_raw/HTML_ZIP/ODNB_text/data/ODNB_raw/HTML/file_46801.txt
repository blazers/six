<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cadbury,  Laurence John</span>  (1889&#150;1982), <span class="occ">chocolate and food manufacturer</span>, was born at Woodbrook, Northfield, King's Norton, Birmingham, on 30 March 1889, the first son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32232/', "George Cadbury (1839&#150;1922)")</script>, chocolate and food manufacturer, and his second wife, Elizabeth Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (1858&#150;1951) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45784/', "Cadbury, Dame Elizabeth Mary")</script>]. He was educated at Leighton Park, Reading, a Quaker public school, and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge (1908&#150;11), where he graduated with a degree in economics. As a young man his sporting interests included sculling, skiing, and motor racing. He then joined the family business in Birmingham, Cadbury Brothers, and three years later served in the Friends' Ambulance Unit in France; he was presented with the Croix de Guerre, as well as the Mons medal and the 1914 star. In 1919 he was appointed OBE, and was also appointed managing director of Cadbury Brothers and associated companies, with special responsibility for engineering, production, and factory development. It was a post he held for forty years.<br>
<br>Cadbury also oversaw wage and employment policies at the company. He actively supported the industry's National Joint Industrial Council, becoming a trustee of the firm's pension fund in 1920 and its chairman in 1932, a position he retained until his retirement. In 1921 he was appointed a director of the British Cocoa and Chocolate Company, the holding company which linked Cadburys and Frys until their formal merger in 1936; he was also active in the formation of overseas subsidiaries in Canada, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Ireland, and South Africa between 1920 and 1937. On 10 November 1925 he married Joyce (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), the daughter of Lewis Oster Mathews, an estate agent of Birmingham; they had two daughters and four sons.<br>
<br>Cadbury was a key figure in the expansion of the family business during the inter-war years, and improvements in production and work organization underpinned marketing and strategic objectives which successfully exploited the firm's competitive advantages. In response to the depressed conditions and falling sales prices of the time, improvements in machinery and plant layout, mostly implemented between 1926 and 1932, increased productivity. The company additionally accrued the returns to scale which were to be found in the rising popularity of milk chocolate bars, and specifically Cadbury's Dairy Milk. Alongside new power plant and other innovations, automatic chocolate moulding machines were introduced in 1927; larger buildings were erected, including the cocoa block in 1929; and throughput was improved. The per unit labour and overhead costs of milk chocolate fell by 56 per cent between 1924 and 1936, and the continuous reduction in the sales price of Cadbury's Dairy Milk, beginning in 1920, reached in 1933 the level of &#145;2oz for 2d&#146;, a competitive advantage that was turned into a famous advertising slogan. The brand was established as the industry's leader, and helped Cadburys achieve the powerful combination of efficiency, size, and consumer loyalty. Unrivalled positive cash flows created a virtuous circle of capital investment, heavy advertising, and price reductions. Output per employee grew significantly between 1922 and 1936; overall output even increased after 1928 and especially after 1933. Although the number of employees fell in the short term as a result of mechanization and enhanced factory organization, the upward trend in demand for confectionery had by 1934 restored employment levels at the company. In 1935 approximately 11,700 people worked for British Cocoa and Chocolate, making it the twenty-ninth largest manufacturing employer in Britain.<br>
<br>During the Second World War parts of the main factory came under the control of the Ministry of Supply, and Cadbury chaired Bournville Utilities, which produced gas masks, aeroplane wings, petrol cans, and machine tools. He went with Lord Beaverbrook's mission to the USSR in 1941 as head of its economic section. In 1944 he succeeded his brother Edward as chairman of both Cadbury Brothers and British Cocoa and Chocolate; he resigned from the Cadbury board and as chairman of British Cocoa and Chocolate in 1959. He chaired the finance committee of the main company until 1962, when its ordinary shares were traded on the stock exchange for the first time, and he finally retired as a director of British Cocoa and Chocolate in 1964. From 1910 until 1978 Cadbury was a trustee of the Bournville Village Trust, which acquired responsibility for some 7000 dwellings, and he served as its chairman from 1954 to 1974. He was also a member of the University of Birmingham's council, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in law in 1970.<br>
<br>In 1922 Cadbury was appointed to the board of the Daily News Trust, established by his father to protect the independence of several Liberal, reforming newspapers, most of which were merged into a single title in 1930. He became its chairman in 1950, and between 1958 and 1967 he also served as a director of Tyne-Tees Television, part owned by the Daily News. In 1960 he was much criticized for secretly selling the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> to Associated Newspapers, owners of the Conservative-inclined <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, and for the subsequent loss of 3500 jobs. The circulation of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> had declined for over a decade, and Cadbury was blamed for failing to appoint a successor more attuned to the requirements of modern journalism.<br>
<br>In the inter-war period, Laurence and Edward Cadbury had effected a business policy which established their chocolate manufacturing business as the industry leader; and, as company chairman, Laurence Cadbury oversaw the end of rationing and the expansion of demand in the 1950s. The next generation of directors, in the 1960s, responded to a new market and new marketing demands and sought to convert Cadburys into a global food and drinks enterprise. Although not a key player in this transformation, Cadbury did employ his expertise within the City of London to supervise the associated conversion to a public company. In 1969, the business merged to form Cadbury Schweppes.<br>
<br>Although deeply involved in the confectionery business and the Daily News Trust for most of his life, Cadbury showed little commitment to his family's Quaker connections. He became concerned chiefly with matters of economics and finance and with issues of population, and regularly offered his views and analysis in a range of journals. He was a director of the Bank of England in 1936&#150;8 and from 1941 to 1961, and high sheriff of the county of London in 1947&#150;8 and 1959&#150;60. He acted as treasurer of the populations investigation committee for forty years (1936&#150;76), and he also served as a trustee of the historic churches preservation committee. In contrast to his background, Cadbury in the post-war years tended to support Conservative policies, although he was neither interested in politics nor directly associated with any political party. Reserved by nature, he had no inclination to enter public life, preferring his home, family, and collections of antique furniture, guns, and books. He died at his home, The Davids, Hole Lane, Northfield, Birmingham, on 5 November 1982, survived by his wife. Their eldest son, Sir Adrian Cadbury, was chairman of Cadbury Schweppes from 1975 to 1989.<br>
