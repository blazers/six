<span class="headword">Ramsay <span class="st"> [Ramsey]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1647&#150;1653), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic agent</span>, was the son of the &eacute;migr&eacute; Scot Dr Alexander Ramsay. According to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> he was born in the parish of St Dunstan-in-the-West in the neighbourhood of Temple Bar and was sent by his father about 1647 to study in the University of Leiden under the care of an uncle, who in fact opposed this plan and instead encouraged Ramsay to take up studies in Greek and philosophy at Glasgow, graduating MA there. Apparently fleeing the plague in Glasgow, Ramsay resumed the study of philosophy in Edinburgh, taking a second MA degree there. To improve himself further he travelled to Bremen, headed south for W&uuml;rzburg, and proceeded to Rome, where he spent some time in a Dominican friary and in a Jesuit college. The pope then sent him, he recalled, to Germany on a mission which involved work among Baptist communities. Returning to Rome he was circumcised in order to appear convincingly as a Jew. Adopting the alias Thomas Horsley, he left Hamburg for the port of Shields in April 1652 and established himself in Newcastle upon Tyne as a Jew, using the name Joseph ben Israel. From Newcastle he moved to nearby Hexham, where he arrived on 4 June 1653, claiming to have been born in Mantua. At Hexham Thomas Tillam had been building up a Baptist congregation in the early 1650s, separate from the Baptist community in Newcastle and in conflict with its ministers. It was this that led to &#145;one of the most bizarre episodes in the religious history of the North&#146;  (Howell, 249)&#151;the case of the &#145;false Jew&#146;. When the apparent Jew ben Israel converted to the Baptist faith, it seemed a triumph for Tillam's ministry in a period of mounting excitement, not least among Baptists, about the possible readmission of the Jews to England, with the prospect, some thought, of their conversion to Christianity as a heralding of the second coming of Christ.<br>
<br>It soon emerged, though, that the Jew ben Israel was in fact the English-born Catholic convert Ramsay, perhaps sent to the north-east by forces unnamed to sow confusion among Baptists there. And if that was his mission he succeeded brilliantly. Tillam's reputation was brought down and that of the Newcastle ministers rehabilitated. Ramsay was summoned to a church hearing in Newcastle, travelling there in company with Tillam and being confronted with the captain who had transported Ramsay to Shields as Horsley. The extraordinary case next came to the government's attention; on 8 July 1653 the keeper of the Gatehouse prison was issued with a warrant by the council of state to take into custody Thomas Ramsay, &#145;suspected of being a Romish priest&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1653&#150;4</i>, 428); on 13 July a warrant was issued for Ramsay's arrest and he was sent to London for examination by the council which, on 4 August 1653, appointed Commissary-General Whalley to head a committee for investigating Ramsay concerning his entry into England. On 23 August it was ordered by the council that the information delivered to it about Ramsay be written up for publication by Secretary Thurloe.<br>
<br>The sensational and serpentine case made ideal journalistic diet, and a work published in Newcastle in 1653 neatly captured the multiple identities of Ramsay as Anglo-Scot, Catholic-Jew and bogus Baptist. If Ramsay was the Thomas Ramsay issued with a pass by the council of state just before the Restoration in March 1660, that is our last glimpse of the &#145;false Jew&#146;.<br>
