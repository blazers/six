</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pitcairne,  Archibald</span>  (1652&#150;1713), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 25 December 1652, the son of Alexander Pitcairne, merchant and magistrate, and his wife, Janet Sydserff (<i>d</i>. 1698). Alexander Pitcairne was registered as a burgess of Edinburgh in 1670, sponsored by Sir Archibald Sydserff, possibly his father-in-law. The Sydserffs originated in Rochlaw, while the Pitcairnes of Fife claimed descent from a single posthumous heir born after Flodden. The Pitcairnes were Episcopalians. Archibald was the eldest son and had at least one brother, David, also a physician, and a sister, Janet, who married Robert Ouchterlony, a shipmaster in Leith.<br>
<br>Archibald Pitcairne attended the Dalkeith School and entered the University of Edinburgh in 1668. His regent was William Paterson, and he graduated MA on 20 March 1671. Some accounts state that Pitcairne originally intended to study divinity, which, in the light of his later reputation for irreligion, seems ironic. He soon abandoned this course for the law, which he pursued so diligently that he became ill, and was advised to travel to France for his health. Stopping in Paris he encountered a group of Scottish medical students, who persuaded him to study medicine instead. His father, however, called him home to Edinburgh after a few months. During the period between this return to Edinburgh and his return to Paris in 1675 Pitcairne began to study mathematics, in which he rapidly became proficient. He may have met the precocious young David Gregory (1659&#150;1708), who later became his closest friend and who shared his mathematical interests, during this period. But it is equally plausible that Pitcairne met Gregory only after 1680; they had almost certainly met by March 1683, when Pitcairne issued a public challenge to the Edinburgh mathematics professor John Young. Young's failure to solve the problem Pitcairne had set him led to his dismissal and the appointment of Gregory in his place.<br>
<br>Pitcairne returned to Paris in 1675 to study medicine. Little specific is known of his study there, but he attended the lectures of anatomist Joseph-Guichard Duverney and no doubt others, both inside and outside the university. He obtained his MD degree from the University of Rheims, which had minimal residence requirements, on 13 August 1680. Pitcairne returned to Edinburgh and immediately entered the circle of &eacute;lite, improving physicians around Robert Sibbald. Sibbald's circle held regular meetings modelled on those of the Royal Society, in which scientific papers were read and new discoveries discussed. Pitcairne was a founder member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, for which Sibbald obtained a charter on 29 November 1681. Pitcairne served as second secretary in 1684. On 30 September 1687 Pitcairne was registered as a burgess of Edinburgh by right of his father. About 1680 Pitcairne married Margaret Hay (<i>d</i>. 1690), daughter of Colonel James Hay of Pitfour. They had a son and a daughter, both of whom died in infancy. Margaret Pitcairne was buried in Greyfriars churchyard on 30 April 1690.<br>
<br>When Sibbald attempted to found a medical school in the University of Edinburgh in 1685 Pitcairne was appointed one of the professors in September of that year, along with Sibbald himself and James Halkett. However, the town council gave the new faculty no financial support, and it does not appear that any of the professors ever lectured. In February 1687 Pitcairne shared his lodgings with David Gregory, and entered one of the most fruitful intellectual periods of his life.<br>
<br>Pitcairne and Gregory shared books and information on medicine and mathematics, draining a good many bottles of claret in the process. Both Pitcairne and Gregory worked on the method of infinite series, and their contributions were later published in the collected works of the English mathematician John Wallis. Pitcairne was present when Gregory received a copy of Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span> soon after its publication in July 1687, and shared in Gregory's excitement at Newton's achievement. Pitcairne had meanwhile been studying the Italian iatro-mechanists, particularly G. A. Borelli and Lorenzo Bellini, and found in Newton's work and its mathematical vision of nature another way to explain the mechanization of the organism.<br>
<br>Pitcairne's first publication was a Latin pamphlet, <span class="italic">Solutio problematis de historicis, seu, De inventoribus dissertatio</span>, published in Edinburgh in 1688. This was in part a response to Andr&eacute; Dacier's translation of the work of Hippocrates, in which he claimed that the ancient Greek had known of the theory of the circulation of the blood. Dacier struck a blow for the ancients in the debate between the ancients and moderns, and Pitcairne responded for the moderns by defending Harvey's claim as discoverer of the circulation. In his work Pitcairne displayed an impressive knowledge both of the classics and of Harvey's work. He claimed Harvey as the first of the iatro-mechanists. This pamphlet was originally to be published with another, more controversial work, Pitcairne's <span class="italic">Epistola Archimedis ad regem Gelonem</span>, a satire ostensibly of medical sects but in reality of presbyterianism. This work was not published until 1710, and then anonymously.<br>
<br>On the basis of this rather slender published evidence, along with nominations by Bishop Gilbert Burnet and James Dalrymple, Viscount Stair, and much reputation by word of mouth, Pitcairne was offered the chair of the practice of medicine at the University of Leiden in November 1691. Meanwhile Pitcairne's Jacobitism had made him unpopular in Edinburgh. He wrote a highly praised Latin epitaph (translated into English by Dryden) for John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, hero of the pyrrhic Jacobite victory at Killiecrankie in 1689. This was published by Walter Scott in his edition of Dryden's works in 1808. Dated to 1692, although not published until much later, were Pitcairne's anti-presbyterian satires, the play <span class="italic">The Assembly</span> and the poem <span class="italic">Babel</span>; both apparently circulated in manuscript. Pitcairne's opposition to the Presbyterian kirk was tied to his Jacobitism. His criticisms of the kirk led to charges of atheism, but it is more likely that Pitcairne, like his friend Gregory, was a devoted, if not devout, Episcopalian.<br>
<br>Pitcairne moved to Leiden in April 1692; along the way he stopped in Cambridge to talk with Newton, and was given a copy of Newton's essay <span class="italic">De natura acidorum</span>, which detailed his theory of matter (this essay was not published until 1710). In his inaugural lecture on 26 April, Pitcairne set the tone for his professorship. He claimed that he would liberate medicine from the thrall of philosophical sects by linking it to the true philosophy, the natural philosophy of Newton. In a series of four dissertations which followed, Pitcairne attempted to outline his new theory of medicine, based on a system of vascular hydraulics. However, the new Newtonian medicine strongly resembled the old mechanical medicine; Pitcairne soon came to realize that a medical theory relying on atomistic matter theory and short-range forces was not easily quantified or demonstrated. Pitcairne issued these lectures as pamphlets and they were reprinted with other essays as <span class="italic">Dissertationes medicae</span> (Rotterdam, 1701). They strongly influenced a Newtonian school of iatro-mechanism whose members included Richard Mead, James Keill, John Freind, and Stephen Hales.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1693 Pitcairne visited Scotland for a holiday and did not return to Leiden, resigning his position in December. His letter of resignation did not specify his reasons, but it has been generally surmised that his fianc&eacute;e, Elizabeth Stevenson (<i>c</i>.1670&#150;1734), daughter of his colleague Sir Archibald Stevenson, did not wish to leave Scotland. The Leiden authorities were displeased by his manner of resigning, and withheld some of his salary, which was paid to his widow only in 1725.<br>
<br>Pitcairne married Elizabeth Stevenson on 8 August 1693. They had four surviving children: three daughters, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 18 March 1718), Margaret (<i>d</i>. August 1777), and Jane, the second daughter, who married Alexander Erskine, fifth earl of Kellie, and who died on 7 June 1776. Their only son took part in the 1715 rebellion on the Jacobite side, and was confined in the Tower for a time. Another child was buried in Greyfriars churchyard in July 1697.<br>
<br>Despite his short stay in Leiden, Pitcairne's lectures and dissertations had an impact on a number of individuals. His Leiden students included William Cockburn, Richard Mead, and the surgeons John Monro and Robert Elliot. Pitcairne obviously inspired great affection in his students, many of whom acknowledged his influence. Mead later interceded for Pitcairne's son in 1715 and succeeded in obtaining his release from the Tower. Hermann Boerhaave was a student in Leiden at the time, but it is not known if he attended Pitcairne's lectures. In addition, the prestige of his Leiden professorship emboldened Pitcairne to embark on new projects in Edinburgh. He encouraged the surgeon Alexander Monteith to petition the town council for the provision of bodies for dissection, and much to the dismay of the Incorporation of Surgeons, who did not welcome competition for scarce cadavers, he succeeded. In October 1694 Monteith was granted for dissection the bodies of those who died in the Correction House, as well as infant foundlings, in exchange for free medical care for the poor. Despite this promotion of anatomy, and his claims that he would reform its study, Pitcairne's own works remained in the more theoretical vein of his dissertations, and seldom mentioned anatomical evidence.<br>
<br>Ever the controversialist, Pitcairne entered the debate at the Edinburgh College of Physicians over the correct therapy for fevers. A self-proclaimed follower of Sydenham, Andrew Brown, had published in 1691 a controversial pamphlet critical of the established therapy for fevers and its emphasis on purging. Several more pamphlets followed. Pitcairne's contribution to the debate, <span class="italic">Dissertatio de curatione febrium</span>, delivered to the college as one of its monthly discourses in November 1694, provoked an uproar among the fellows. While Pitcairne supported the conventional therapy based on evacuations, he justified it in terms of his new mechanico-Newtonian theory, which most fellows found unacceptable. True to form, Pitcairne then published his lecture as a pamphlet. This controversy added fire to existing factions among the membership over politics, personalities, and the preparation of a pharmacopoeia; as a result Pitcairne and his supporters, including his father-in-law, Stevenson, a former president of the college, were ejected from the college in December 1695. A general amnesty was declared only in 1703; meanwhile, Pitcairne had allied himself with the surgeons, being elected to the Incorporation of Surgeons on 16 October 1701. His former student Robert Elliot had assumed the position of anatomy professor to the incorporation and performed a yearly public dissection, at which Pitcairne delivered the concluding lecture for several years. On 7 August 1699 Pitcairne had been awarded an honorary MD degree from King's College, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Pitcairne's brash style and forceful personality were easily satirized. Edward Eizat, a physician and classmate of Pitcairne's at the University of Edinburgh, published anonymously <span class="italic">Apollo mathematicus, or, The art of curing diseases by the mathematicks, according to the principles of Dr Pitcairn</span> in 1695 in response to Pitcairne's essay on fevers. Another of Pitcairne's Leiden students, George Hepburn, replied in <span class="italic">Tarrugo Unmasked</span> (1695), and the ensuing pamphlet war dragged on for several years. Among Pitcairne's champions were two more former students, James Johnston and George Cheyne. The debate came to an abrupt end in 1702 when Charles Oliphant, a former ally and Gregory's brother-in-law, accused Cheyne of drunkenness.<br>
<br>Pitcairne's own fondness for the bottle was well known; Robert Wodrow claimed &#145;he got a vast income, but spent it upon drinking, and was twice drunk every day&#146;  (Wodrow, 255). While Wodrow was a hostile commentator, many contemporaries noted the intemperance of both Pitcairne and Gregory. On 25 July 1700 Pitcairne avoided imprisonment in the Canongate for writing a seditious letter by claiming he was in his cups when he wrote it, and Mrs Henderson's howff (tavern) was a favourite resort. Yet he was also a popular and successful medical practitioner, and gained some fame as a poet in Latin, often taking the pseudonym of Walter Dannistoun and writing on Jacobite themes. A volume of his Latin poetry, <span class="italic">Selecta poemata</span>, edited by R. Freebairn, was published posthumously in 1727, and Scott remarked that Pitcairne's Latin epitaph on Dundee was much superior to Dryden's translation.<br>
<br>Pitcairne's continuing devotion to the Jacobite cause did not, apparently, go beyond writing poetry, and he was on good terms with many politicians, both whig and tory. Pitcairne endeavoured to use their patronage to fill Scottish university chairs with his selected candidates, and Gregory commented on his negotiations with the earl of Roxburghe to this end. Pitcairne's former student George Cheyne, who had moved to London at his urging in 1701, acted as an intermediary in these negotiations.<br>
<br>Less is known of Pitcairne's life after 1700. He published little, and seems to have devoted himself to his extensive medical practice and to his poetry. His correspondence with his friend Robert Gray and others reveals his sharp opinions of his contemporaries, but he did not enter into further public controversy. He did instigate a reply by Thomas Bower (under the pseudonym of James Walkinshaw) to the 1709 <span class="italic">Letter from Sir R---t S---d, to Dr Archibald Pitcairne</span>. This letter was probably written by William Cockburn in response to Pitcairne's criticisms of his works. Bower's reply defended Pitcairne.<br>
<br>Pitcairne's published works were collected and translated into English by John Desaguliers and George Sewell and published in 1715 (2nd edn, 1727); his Leiden lectures from 1692&#150;3 were collected and published by the apothecary John Quincy as <span class="italic">Elementa medicinae</span> in 1717, and translated into English in the following year.<br>
<br>Pitcairne, who had apparently been in poor health for some time, died in Edinburgh on 23 October 1713. He was buried in Greyfriars churchyard on 26 October, where in 1800 a monument was erected to his memory by a committee of Edinburgh physicians. Pitcairne's will was not proved until 1 October 1720. The probate record detailed numerous debts, far outnumbering Pitcairne's assets, which amounted to his library. His book collection was well known and it sold in London for &pound;430, destined for the court of Peter the Great in Russia. Pitcairne's widow bore responsibility for payment of his debts. His only son had died not long after his release from the Tower, while fighting as a mercenary in the Netherlands.<br>
