<span class="headword">Turnbull,  George</span>  (1698&#150;1748), <span class="occ">theologian and teacher</span>, was born on 11 July 1698 in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, the third of nine children of the minister George Turnbull the elder (1657&#150;1744) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Glass of Sauchie. He entered the University of Edinburgh in the autumn of 1711 and began to study for divinity in 1717, but did not graduate MA until May 1721. While in Edinburgh Turnbull became a member of the Rankenian Club, founded in 1716 or 1717 by a circle of iconoclastic students and their friends, which included two of his closest associates, the preacher William Wishart (<i>c</i>.1692&#150;1753) and the surgeon George Young (1692&#150;1757). Turnbull was then apparently preoccupied with fashioning a rational form of Christianity, which prompted him to attempt to initiate a correspondence with John Toland (1670&#150;1722) in November 1718, and to write a passionate defence of religious toleration which he later claimed had remained unpublished because booksellers had baulked at its advocacy of freethinking in religion.<br>
<br>Turnbull was elected a regent at Marischal College, Aberdeen, on 14 April 1721. His two published graduation theses, <span class="italic">De scientiae naturalis cum philosophia morali conjunctione</span> (1723) and <span class="italic">De pulcherrima mundi cum materialis tum rationalis constitutione</span> (1726), show that he was the first Scottish academic to advocate in print the use of the Newtonian method in moral philosophy, and that he continued to engage with the ideas of heterodox thinkers like Toland. Along with his colleague David Verner (1688&#150;1752), Turnbull expounded the ideas of Lord Shaftesbury (1671&#150;1713) and promoted instruction in natural jurisprudence and history. Additionally, he seems to have championed the ideology of &#145;old whigs&#146; such as Lord Molesworth (1656&#150;1725), with whom he corresponded in 1722&#150;3. Yet he also dwelt on the moralists of classical antiquity, whose writings he regarded as an antidote to the pedantry of scholasticism. Through this intellectual diet, Turnbull aspired to produce virtuous citizens and rational Christians who were schooled in polite and useful knowledge.<br>
<br>Despite his success in the classroom and his influence on pupils such as Thomas Reid (1710&#150;1796), Turnbull rapidly became disillusioned with Marischal. As early as May 1723 he was seeking a position elsewhere through the patronage of Molesworth and, in March 1725, Turnbull and his friend, the professor of mathematics Colin Maclaurin (1698&#150;1746), quarrelled with the principal, Thomas Blackwell the elder (1660?&#150;1728). Maclaurin resigned, and Turnbull left without permission to serve as tutor to the Udney family. He was summoned back from the continent, and resumed teaching in January 1726. In the spring of 1727 he finally resigned, and was awarded an honorary degree of LLD from the college.<br>
<br>Turnbull now became tutor to Andrew Wauchope of Niddry, and during the next five years travelled to Edinburgh, Groningen, Utrecht, and various stops in the Low Countries, Germany, and France. He was back in London by May 1732 looking for further employment, and received a second LLD degree, from the University of Edinburgh, on 13 June. Letters to a friend, the Edinburgh professor of universal history Charles Mackie (1688&#150;1767?), show that Turnbull was cultivating the patronage of the Jacobite Lord Cornbury (1710&#150;1753), among others, but he temporarily failed to secure another suitable position. Turnbull evidently decided at this juncture that he might seek preferment in the Anglican church, for he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, in the Michaelmas term of 1733 and was granted a BCL degree.<br>
<br>Despite serious misgivings about leaving England to act as a tutor, Turnbull's precarious finances forced him to travel to Italy in 1735 with the son of Lord Rockingham, Thomas Watson (1715&#150;1746), where they remained until 1737. On his return Turnbull again sought gainful employment in London and, after an unsuccessful bid in early 1739 to become the secretary of the Society for the Encouragement of Learning (to which he had belonged since its foundation in 1735), he used his connections with Thomas Birch (1705&#150;1766) and the latitudinarian divine Arthur Ashley Sykes (1684?&#150;1756) to secure ordination by the bishop of Winchester, Benjamin Hoadly (1676&#150;1761). He also began to move in court circles, and in 1741 was appointed as a chaplain to the prince of Wales, while continuing to ply his trade as a tutor at Kew. The following year Turnbull was made rector of Drumachose, co. Derry, by the bishop of Derry, Thomas Rundle (1688?&#150;1743). Presumably through connections at court, Turnbull became tutor to Horatio Walpole (1723&#150;1809), and embarked on another tour of Italy in 1744. After stops in Milan and Turin, Turnbull and his pupil resided in Florence in 1745&#150;6 and then left for Rome, partly because the duke of Newcastle wanted Turnbull to obtain intelligence about the Jacobites.<br>
<br>During the 1730s and early 1740s Turnbull issued a series of pamphlets and books which owed much to his Marischal College lectures and to his earlier theological concerns. In 1731 he published a small tract written in 1726 and inspired by a passage in Shaftesbury, <span class="italic">A philosophical enquiry concerning the connexion betwixt the doctrines and miracles of Jesus Christ</span>, in which he argued that just as experiments prove the validity of scientific propositions, Christ's miracles prove the truth of the Christian doctrine of the afterlife. This tract was intended to counteract the views of Anthony Collins (1676&#150;1729) and Matthew Tindal (1657&#150;1733), and Turnbull again attacked Tindal in <span class="italic">Christianity neither False nor Useless, Tho' not as Old as the Creation</span> (1732), which took up the question of miracles as part of a defence of Samuel Clarke's account of the relation between natural and revealed religion.<br>
<br>While he was in Italy in the mid-1730s Turnbull seems to have conceived the idea for a work on the art of classical antiquity, and back in London he was able to secure a fine set of illustrations by Camillo Paderni through his fellow Scot, the painter Allan Ramsay the younger (1713&#150;1784), who was then in Rome. After delays caused by money problems, which were exacerbated by his failure to secure the sponsorship of the Society for the Encouragement of Learning, Turnbull's <span class="italic">A Treatise on Ancient Painting</span> finally appeared in 1740. Although the book was satirized a decade later in William Hogarth's print <span class="italic">Beer Street</span>, Turnbull developed an innovative case for the educational purposes of the fine arts based on his theory that painting is a language which conveys truths about nature or morality, and in so doing challenged the common assumption that history painting was superior to other genres such as portraiture and landscapes.<br>
<br>The year 1740 also saw the publication of another brief religious work, <span class="italic">An Impartial Enquiry into the Moral Character of Jesus Christ</span>, wherein Turnbull claimed that Christ was the greatest of all moral philosophers and that the purity of his morals demonstrated the truth of his teachings, along with the most comprehensive statement of his philosophical ideas, <span class="italic">The Principles of Moral and Christian Philosophy</span>. Drawing on his Aberdeen lectures as well as his contacts with professors of natural jurisprudence in the Netherlands, Turnbull produced in 1741 an annotated translation of a Latin text by J. G. Heineccius, <span class="italic">A Methodical System of Universal Law</span>, which contains an important appendix in which he affirms that the study of natural law is an empirical science grounded on the anatomy of human nature. His last major work, <span class="italic">Observations upon Liberal Education</span>, appeared in 1742 and advanced a novel view of the interconnections between the various branches of human knowledge; it had a profound impact on curriculum reforms undertaken at Marischal and King's College in Aberdeen in 1753. In addition, Turnbull issued three minor translations, of which <span class="italic">Justin's &#145;History of the World&#146;</span> (1742) is the most noteworthy for its lengthy preface, which amplifies his remarks in the <span class="italic">Observations</span> regarding the value of historical knowledge. Following his appointment as rector at Drumachose in 1742 Turnbull lived in obscurity. He died from unknown causes in The Hague on 31 January 1748 while gathering information on the Jacobites for Lord Newcastle.<br>
