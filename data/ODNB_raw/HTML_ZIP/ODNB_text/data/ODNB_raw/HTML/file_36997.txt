<span class="headword">Wood,  Charles Lindley</span>, second Viscount Halifax  (1839&#150;1934), <span class="occ">ecumenist</span>, was born at the Admiralty in London on 7 June 1839, the second of the eight children and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29865/', "Sir Charles Wood, later first Viscount Halifax (1800&#150;1885)")</script>, Liberal politician, and his wife, Lady Mary (1807&#150;1884), the fifth daughter of Charles Grey, second Earl Grey. He was privately educated until 1852, when he was sent to Eton College; from here he went in 1858 to Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a fourth in law and modern history in 1863.<br>
<br>As a child Charles, with his sister Emily, was invited to play with the royal children at Buckingham Palace, and the friendship formed with the prince of Wales, later Edward VII, proved to be lifelong. On the prince's marriage in 1862 Wood became groom of the bedchamber. He was expected to go into politics, like his father, and in the same year he became private secretary to his cousin, Sir George Grey, the home secretary, a post which he held until 1864. He was subsequently offered a post in the government on at least two occasions, the last in 1886.<br>
<br>Although Wood had fallen under the influence of the Oxford Movement even before he went to university, it was there that he heard E. B. Pusey preach and began his friendship with H. P. Liddon, to whom he made his first confession about 1863. He did some work among the poor in London, in connection with the House of Charity, Soho, and in 1866 spent three months working among cholera victims in a temporary hospital in Bethnal Green, set up by Pusey and Priscilla Lydia Sellon. He even seriously considered joining the Society of St John the Evangelist when it was started, but R. M. Benson, the founder, told him he should serve God in the world. In 1868, to the initial regret of his father, he agreed to Pusey's request that he should be president of the English Church Union (ECU), an organization founded in 1860 to maintain the Catholic heritage of the Church of England, and to defend those who were under attack for their religious principles. He regarded this as his vocation in life: &#145;To see the Church of England, what it should be, and ultimately to see the reunion of Christendom, exhausts every possible ambition that I can picture to myself&#146;  (Lockhart, 1.145). He was president continuously until 1919, and again from 1927 until his death. Although his involvement in church politics made him feel obliged to resign from his position in the prince's household in 1877, he never regretted his decision. Indeed, on succeeding to his father's title as second Viscount Halifax of Monk Bretton in 1885, he affirmed it by changing the family motto to &#145;I like my choice&#146;.<br>
<br>Wood proved to be an excellent chairman of the monthly meetings of the council of the ECU, holding together a group which included some forceful characters with divergent views, while putting his own arguments cogently and persuasively. He steered the ECU through a long series of controversies in the Church of England over doctrine and ritual, which became more bitter with the passing of the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span> in 1874 and the consequent imprisonment of several clergymen. Pusey praised him as &#145;the sense and moderation&#146; of the council  (H. P. Liddon, <span class="italic">Life of E. B. Pusey</span>, 4, 1898, 326). When he became a peer he took advantage of his right to speak in the Lords to defend the Catholic cause. It was in no small part due to Halifax that the bishops refused to allow any more prosecutions of ritualist clergy, and that the externals of Catholic worship were restored and tolerated in the Church of England.<br>
<br>Halifax had long shared Pusey's vision of the corporate reunion of the Church of England with Rome, based on mutual explanation of the Anglican and Roman formularies. Aided by the Abb&eacute; Fernand Portal, a Lazarist priest and theologian, with whom he formed a deep friendship after a chance meeting in Madeira in 1890, he initiated two dialogues. The first revolved round the question of the validity of Anglican orders, about which Portal wrote a pamphlet to stimulate interest in France. Halifax tried to rouse support for reunion on both sides of the channel. He introduced Portal to the two Anglican archbishops and made several speeches, including an important one in Bristol that he had printed and circulated. He visited both Archbishop E. W. Benson and the pope, Leo XIII, even drafting letters for each of them, although they refused to enter into direct correspondence, and, with Portal, he launched in 1895&#150;6 the <span class="italic">Revue Anglo-Romaine</span>, a magazine dealing with the problems of reunion. The outcome was the establishment in Rome of a commission of Roman Catholic theologians and historians, whose conclusions led Leo XIII to issue his encyclical <span class="italic">Apostolicae curae</span> (1896) condemning Anglican orders as &#145;absolutely null and utterly void&#146;. Halifax was deeply hurt but, convinced of the importance of the event, he collected all the relevant documents and correspondence and published them in 1912 under the title <span class="italic">Leo XIII and Anglican Orders</span>.<br>
<br>The second dialogue took place after a gap of twenty-five years. Halifax, then in his eighties, feeling that the &#145;Appeal to all Christians&#146; of the 1920 Lambeth conference had created a more favourable climate, together with Portal, approached Cardinal Mercier, the Belgian primate, who was known to be sympathetic to the cause of reunion, with a view to discussing their differences. He succeeded in getting a letter of commendation from Archbishop Randall Davidson and this, together with the fact that the archbishop later nominated two additional theologians, Charles Gore and B. J. Kidd, to join the original two, W. H. Frere and Joseph Armitage Robinson, recruited by Halifax, gave the subsequent &#145;Malines conversations&#146; a semi-official character. The first conversation in 1921 was based on a memorandum on the church and sacraments, drawn up by Halifax himself. The reluctance of the archbishop and the Vatican to be openly involved made the process very slow. Halifax worked tirelessly behind the scenes, writing letters to the press and to influential friends, and publishing a <span class="italic">Call to Reunion</span> in 1922, in order to help carry forward the talks. His increasing deafness, however, made it difficult for him to play an active part in the later conversations. After the pope put an end to them, following the deaths of Mercier and Portal, Halifax, ignoring the wishes of the archbishop of Canterbury and the new archbishop of Malines (Mechelen), published the separate but mutually agreed reports on the conversations by the Anglican and Roman Catholic participants in <span class="italic">The Conversations at Malines 1921&#150;1925</span>, and his own <span class="italic">Notes on the Conversations at Malines</span> in 1928. Two years later, with a blatant disregard for the copyright laws, he published all the papers read at Malines, except one by Gore. Halifax was undoubtedly unrealistic about the possibilities of reunion at that time but, without what Gore called his &#145;so courageous a hopefulness&#146;  (Lockhart, 2.311), this first semi-official dialogue would never have taken place.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1869 Wood had married Lady Agnes Elizabeth Courtenay (1838&#150;1919), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6459/', "William Reginald Courtenay, eleventh earl of Devon")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, first Earl Fortescue. It was a happy marriage which lasted fifty years. The couple had four sons, all but the youngest of whom died young, and two daughters. The fourth son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36998/', "Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, first earl of Halifax (1881&#150;1959)")</script>, viceroy of India and foreign secretary. Halifax enjoyed the life of a country gentleman, entertaining his friends and relations and hunting in Yorkshire, where he lived at Hickleton Hall, near Doncaster. He was &#145;a charming host and a whimsical companion&#146;, delighting in practical jokes, family games, and dressing up  (Hodgson, 7). He died on 19 January 1934 at Hickleton, where he was buried four days later, one of his last achievements, the union of the ECU and the Anglo-Catholic Congress, having just been accomplished. A few years after his death, his son Edward published the ghost stories which he had collected throughout his life and loved to tell in <span class="italic">Lord Halifax's Ghost Book</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Further Stories from Lord Halifax's Ghost Book</span> (1937).<br>
