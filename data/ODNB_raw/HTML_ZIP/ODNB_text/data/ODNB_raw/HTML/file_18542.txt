<span class="headword">Melvill,  Thomas</span>  (1726&#150;1753), <span class="occ">natural philosopher</span>, was born in Monimail, Fife, the son of the Revd Andrew Melvil (<i>d</i>. 1736) of Monimail and his wife, Helen, formerly White, and the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18551/', "Robert Melville (1723&#150;1809)")</script>, army officer. He matriculated at Glasgow University in 1739 and graduated MA in 1744. In 1748&#150;9, as a student of divinity at the university, he became friends with Alexander Wilson, later the first professor of astronomy at Glasgow. Together they decided to explore the temperature of the upper air by raising a string of kites, each of which bore a thermometer. In July 1749 and again the following summer they sent up kites. It was arranged that the thermometers, wrapped in bundles of protective paper, should be detached by setting a slow match to burn through the strings that held them, and fall to the ground (the registering thermometer had yet to be invented). As these experiments were done in fine weather, they did not anticipate Franklin's discovery of atmospheric electricity.<br>
<br>Melvill then studied optics, intending to verify Newton's theories. In his &#145;Observations on light and colours&#146;, delivered to the Medical Society of Edinburgh on 3 January and 7 February 1752, Melvill described his use of a prism to examine an alcohol flame coloured by various salts. He remarked on a yellow line always seen at a constant place in the spectrum. This yellow line was in fact derived from sodium, which was present as a constituent or impurity in all the salts that he was testing; hence Melvill is sometimes seen as the father of flame spectroscopy, though there is no evidence that he thought of his experiments as a method of analysis.<br>
<br>In a letter sent from Geneva on 2 February 1753 to the astronomer royal, James Bradley, Melvill discussed whether light rays of differing colours travelled at different velocities, which might account for their differing refraction through a prism. He proposed that this could be confirmed if the satellites of Jupiter were seen to change slightly in colour as they occulted and emerged. This letter was read before the Royal Society on 8 March and the telescope maker James Short was instructed to make the necessary observations, but he reported that no such effect could be seen. In a second letter to Bradley, dated 2 June, Melvill suggested that the rate of light travel concerned in aberration might be affected by the humours of the eye itself. Melvill died in Geneva in December 1753 at the age of twenty-seven.<br>
