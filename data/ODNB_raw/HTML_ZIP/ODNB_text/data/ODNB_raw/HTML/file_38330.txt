<span class="headword">Milward,  John</span>  (1599&#150;1670), <span class="occ">parliamentary diarist</span>, was born on 28 October 1599 and baptized at Thorpe, Derbyshire, the second son of John Milward (1551&#150;1633) of Bradley Ash and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1651), daughter of William Blount of Osbaldeston, Lancashire. Milward served as a captain in the Derbyshire militia in the late 1630s and as sheriff of Derbyshire in 1635&#150;7. During the civil war he commanded a foot regiment in the marquess of Newcastle's royalist army and in early 1644 he, with other Derbyshire gentlemen, was left in the county to confront troops under the command of Sir John Gell (another Derbyshire gentleman, and Milward's predecessor as sheriff) when Newcastle was called north to fight the Scots. Subsequently his regiment was called away by Goring, and may have fought at Marston Moor. Milward submitted to parliament after July 1644. His application to compound came with the recommendation of the county committee because he had restrained his soldiers from plundering, but he was, nevertheless, fined &pound;1000 in December 1645. After the war he was engaged in some business interests with his former adversary, Gell: Gell demised land to him in 1649, and Gell's son and Milward appear to have been sold a lease of lead mines at Wirksworth in 1648. Milward's wife, Anne, daughter of James Whitehalgh of Whitehalgh, Ipstones, Staffordshire, with whom he had three sons and eight daughters, died on 20 June 1658.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Milward was regarded locally as one of the most deserving of cavaliers. He was praised for his initial refusal to join with Derbyshire presbyterians (including Gell) in the commission of the peace; indeed their continuance in office appears to have been a particular grievance of his, as he raised it in the Commons in 1668. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant for Derbyshire in August 1660: his letter-book on militia business survives and suggests that he was among the most active of the Derbyshire deputies, and closely consulted by the lord lieutenant, the third earl of Devonshire.<br>
<br>After the conferral of a peerage on John Frescheville in 1665 Milward replaced him as one of the knights of the shire for Derbyshire. From the time he took his seat at the beginning of the 1666&#150;7 session of parliament to the adjournment of the 1667&#150;9 session in August 1668, he kept a detailed diary of its proceedings, providing a daily account of business in the House of Commons. His diary, which exists in a scribal copy in the British Library, gives reasonably full coverage of the major debates, including those on supply and Irish cattle in the 1667 session and the impeachment of Clarendon in late 1667. It also includes fairly detailed accounts of sermons delivered to the Commons and elsewhere. It is the only complete informal record of the first of the sessions, and for the second of them it complements the diary taken by his countryman Anchitell Grey, who was elected as burgess for Derby a few months before Milward's own return. The fact that two Derbyshire men should be engaged in compiling the only extant Commons diaries of this period, combined with Milward's connections with the earl of Devonshire as revealed in the militia business letter-book, has led to the suggestion that both diaries may have been produced for Devonshire's benefit  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, xv).<br>
<br>The diary shows that Milward was a loyalist and suspicious of the intentions of the government's principal parliamentary critics. He regarded Sir Richard Temple's <span class="roman">Triennial Bill</span> of 1668 as abhorrent, and noted how it was seconded and supported by Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir Robert Howard, and Sir Robert Carr &#145;and all that gang&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 190). He was no courtier, however. He was keen on the banning of the Irish cattle trade, against the court's wishes, and on popular solutions to the government's financial crises such as the replacement of the hearth tax and the excise. He may have been identified by &#145;country&#146; politicians and by the duke of Buckingham as a possible ally: he records himself as accepting dinner from Sir Robert Carr on one occasion and Sir Thomas Osborne in 1670 assumed that he would be susceptible to an approach from the duke on behalf of the court. What most concerned Milward, though, was the state of the church and the defence of its supporters. The diary gives particularly detailed coverage of ecclesiastical business, especially of the debates on toleration and the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> in March and April 1668, and indicates his own strong objections to the proposals. He was close to Gilbert Sheldon, the archbishop of Canterbury and a fellow countryman from Derbyshire. The diary records twelve occasions on which he met Sheldon or was invited by him to dine at Lambeth, and Sheldon, who referred to Milward as his &#145;ancient acquaintance countryman and my good friend&#146; helped to get his son into Trinity College, Oxford  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. C. 308, fol. 378).<br>
<br>Milward died at Snitterton, Darley Dale, Derbyshire, on 14 September 1670 and was buried a week later at Darley Dale church, as his wife had been. Despite a reputation as one of the strongest of cavaliers, Milward was apparently a popular figure, noted as even-handed and public-spirited; a local poet marked his death with lines which celebrate him as an old-fashioned type of the good landlord, neighbour, and father.<br>
