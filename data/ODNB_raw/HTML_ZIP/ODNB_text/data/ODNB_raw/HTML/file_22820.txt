<span class="headword">Pritchard,  Edward William</span>  (1825&#150;1865), <span class="occ">surgeon and poisoner</span>, son of Captain John White Pritchard RN, was born at Southsea, Hampshire, on 6 December 1825. He was educated in London and Paris, and apprenticed in September 1840 to Edward and Charles Scott, surgeons, in Portsmouth. On completing his apprenticeship he entered King's College as a hospital student of surgery in October 1843, although this was later denied by the hospital authorities. Much of the information about his medical career derives from an entry supplied by himself in the <span class="italic">Medical Directory</span> of 1865; the dates are variously given by several writers on his life and should all be viewed with some scepticism. <br>
<br>Pritchard was admitted a member of the College of Surgeons on 29 May 1846 and was at once gazetted assistant surgeon serving on board the <i>Collingwood</i>, the <i>Calypso</i>, and the <i>Asia</i>, going to Egypt and other countries bordering the Mediterranean, as well as to the Pitcairn Islands on the steam-sloop <i>Hecate</i>. He resigned from the navy in 1847 and became private physician to a gentleman traveller with whom he visited the Holy Land. He passed the examinations for licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in the same year. Pritchard decided to settle in England, and on 19 September 1850 married Mary Jane, daughter of Michael Taylor, a retired silk and lace merchant of Edinburgh, whom he met at a ball in Portsmouth. They had five children. With his father-in-law's help he established himself in a general practice in Hunmanby, Yorkshire, in 1851, and moved to Filey in 1854. In 1857 he purchased the degree of MD from the University of Erlangen in Germany, and moved to Edinburgh in 1859. In 1860 he moved to Glasgow, where he lived at 11 Berkeley Terrace, applying unsuccessfully for the chair of surgery at the Andersonian University in October of that year. He was not popular with his medical colleagues and was considered &#145;ignorant, daring and reckless&#146;. Nevertheless, he published articles in reputable medical journals, and became a director of the Glasgow Athenaeum and an examiner in physiology under the Society of Arts. <br>
<br>Late on the night of 5 May 1863 there was a fire at Pritchard's house in which a servant, Elizabeth McGirn, perished. The fire insurance was unpaid, and Pritchard was suspected of raising the fire to cause McGirn's death as it was likely that she was pregnant, but the matter was not pursued. In May 1864 he purchased the practice of Dr Corbett and his house in Clarence Place, 131 Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, with a loan of &pound;500 from his mother-in-law, Mrs Jane Cowper Taylor. He had by now seduced a fifteen-year-old servant, Mary McLeod, and procured an abortion for her. In November 1864 his wife became ill and went to stay with her mother in Edinburgh to recover, but became ill again on her return. Her mother came to Glasgow to nurse her. In December of that year, and in January, February, and March 1865, Pritchard bought Fleming's tincture of aconite. Mrs Taylor died on 25 February 1865 after eating a tapioca pudding; Pritchard signed a death certificate attributing the death to a stroke. Mrs Pritchard died on 17/18 March, and Pritchard registered the death as caused by gastric fever. The procurator fiscal received an anonymous letter accusing Pritchard of causing the two deaths, and he was arrested on a charge of murder soon afterwards. <br>
<br>The trial began on 3 July 1865 at the high court of justiciary in Edinburgh before John Inglis and lasted for five days. Both bodies were exhumed and autopsies showed that both contained large quantities of antimony. The defence suggested that the murders had been committed by Mary McLeod, who testified that Pritchard had promised to marry her on the death of his wife. It was proved that Pritchard was in debt and expected a large sum of money on the death of the two women, and that he administered antimony to his wife over some months and aconite to Mrs Taylor in a sedative which she took regularly. Pritchard confessed to his guilt on the day of sentencing, exonerating Mary McLeod, and was sentenced to death. He was hanged by William Calcraft in front of Glasgow gaol on 28 July 1865; 100,000 people attended what was the last public execution in Glasgow. <br>
<br>Pritchard had some reputation as a lecturer on such subjects as &#145;Egypt and its climate&#146; and, in addition to his medical papers, published works including <span class="italic">A Visit to Pitcairn Island</span> (1847), <span class="italic">Observations on Filey as a Watering Place</span> (1853), which ran to three editions, and <span class="italic">Coast Lodgings for the Poorer Cities</span> (1854). He was described as being a plausible liar, vain to a degree, 5 feet 11 inches tall, well proportioned, with a pleasing face, regular features, and aquiline nose, bald but with a lock of light brown hair adjusted to cover his head, and with a flowing beard.<br>
