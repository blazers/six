<span class="headword">Conybeare,  John</span>  (1692&#150;1755), <span class="occ">bishop of Bristol</span>, was born on 31 January 1692 at Pinhoe, near Exeter. He was educated at the Exeter Free School. His father, the vicar of Pinhoe, whose vicarage was wrecked by the famous storm of 1703, died about 1706 &#145;of a disorder caught on that occasion&#146;. Friends helped Conybeare to continue his education, and he was admitted at Exeter College, Oxford, on 22 March 1708. He was elected a probationary fellow of his college in June 1710, and full fellow on 14 July 1711. He was a member of the strongly whig Constitutional Club. Conybeare graduated BA on 17 July 1713, and on 30 June 1714 was appointed praelector in philosophy by his college. On 19 December 1714 he was ordained deacon, and on 27 May 1716 priest.<br>
<br>After holding a curacy for a short time at Fetcham, Surrey, Conybeare returned to Oxford, became tutor of his college, and soon obtained a reputation as a staunchly orthodox Anglican. The university church of St Mary's was crowded when he was in the pulpit. In 1719 he was one of those in the forefront of the move to prosecute Thomas Warton for heterodoxy. A sermon of his on miracles published in 1722 went through four editions, and was followed by another on the mysteries in 1724. Bishop Gibson appointed him one of the newly founded king's preachers at Whitehall; and in May 1724 Lord Chancellor Macclesfield presented him to the small rectory of St Clement's, Oxford. He was proctor in 1725, and proceeded BD in June 1728, and DD in January 1729. Among his pupils were Thomas Secker and the two sons of Charles Talbot, then solicitor-general. Conybeare dedicated two sermons to the solicitor-general and his father, William Talbot, bishop of Durham. His chances of preferment were injured by the death of the bishop in 1730. In the same year, however, he was elected rector of Exeter College. In 1732 he published <span class="italic">A Defence of Reveal'd Religion</span> in reply to Tindal's controversial <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>; Conybeare's work was praised as one of the four ablest books produced on the occasion. Warburton called it &#145;one of the best-reasoned books in the world&#146;. Conybeare was a temperate and able writer, and his lucid arguments attracted support from as far afield as Germany.<br>
<br>The Exeter rectorship was a poor one, and soon afterwards Bishop Gibson successfully procured Conybeare's appointment to the deanery of Christ Church. He was installed in January 1733, and on 6 June 1733 married Jemima (<i>bap</i>. 1703, <i>d</i>. 1747), daughter of William and Elizabeth Juckes of Hoxton Square, London. The Conybeares had five children.<br>
<br>At Exeter College Conybeare effected many reforms, putting a stop to the sale of servants' places and opposing absenteeism and pluralism among the fellows; he instituted tutorial fees and restored lectures. In 1734 he entertained the prince of Orange at the deanery. Conybeare seems to have been energetic at Christ Church. In 1735 he published <span class="italic">Calumny Refuted, or, An Answer to the Personal Slander of Dr Richard Newton</span>, this time when Newton was endeavouring to obtain a charter for Hart Hall, a plan opposed by Conybeare. He subsequently led the whig interest in the parliamentary election of 1737 against Newton and the tory interest, and he thereafter remained a staunch whig, publishing a sermon on <span class="italic">True Patriotism</span> in 1749. His hopes of a bishopric were lowered by the death of Charles Talbot, while lord chancellor, in 1737, and by Bishop Gibson's loss of influence at court. In 1750, however, after Archbishop Herring interceded with Newcastle on his behalf, he was appointed to the see of Bristol, in succession to Joseph Butler. With the bishopric he continued to hold the Christ Church deanery. Conybeare was by now a widower, following the death of Jemima on 29 October 1747; his health was broken by gout and he was disabled for most of his episcopate. He died in Bristol on 13 July 1755, and was buried in Bristol Cathedral. Two of his children survived him, Jemima (<i>d</i>. 1785) and William, who was to become DD and rector of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. They were left without much provision, and Archbishop Secker arranged for two volumes of sermons to be published by subscription for their benefit in 1757. As there were 4600 subscribers, many of whom took more than one copy, the results must have been satisfactory. Nevertheless Secker was obliged to solicit a pension of &pound;140 for Conybeare's dependants.<br>
