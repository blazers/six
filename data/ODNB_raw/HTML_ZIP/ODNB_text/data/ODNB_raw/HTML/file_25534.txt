<span class="headword">&AElig;thelberht II</span>  (<em>d.</em> 762), <span class="occ">joint king of Kent</span>, succeeded to the kingdom of Kent with his brother <a name="cosubject_57716"></a><span class="headword">Eadberht I</span>  (<em>d.</em> 748)<span class="occ"></span> in 725 after the long reign of their father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29381/', "Wihtred (d. 725)")</script>, who had re-established the kingdom's independence after the foreign invasions of the late 680s. Their half-brother Alric is said by Bede to have been coheir, but there is no trace of him after 725 and it is possible that he was denied power. Understanding of this period has been obscured by the incorrect chronological framework proposed by the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury, who gave the three brothers consecutive reigns: Eadberht from 725 to 748; &AElig;thelberht from 748 until 762; and Alric from 762 until 796. The issue was further confused by radical emendation in the later middle ages of the muniments of St Augustine's Abbey and of Christ Church, Canterbury, intended to bring them into line with Malmesbury's chronology. In fact, &AElig;thelberht and Eadberht seem to have ruled jointly from 725. The kingdom may have been divided between them, with &AElig;thelberht based in the east and Eadberht in the west; &AElig;thelberht was apparently regarded as the senior ruler. Eadberht died in 748 and was buried in Reculver Minster; his position in west Kent was inherited by his son <a name="cosubject_57717"></a><span class="headword">Eardwulf</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 762)<span class="occ"></span>. &AElig;thelberht survived until 762, and chose to be buried in the monastery of St Peter and St Paul (later St Augustine's Abbey) in Canterbury.<br>
<br>By 731 Kent, along with the other kingdoms south of the Humber, appears to have acknowledged the overlordship of &AElig;thelbald, king of the Mercians. It is impossible to say whether this degree of domination lasted until &AElig;thelbald's death in 757. None of the Kentish charters issued by &AElig;thelberht, Eadberht I, or Eardwulf has any reference to Mercian overlordship, but this does not prove that Kent was independent; in his dealings with the rulers of major kingdoms such as Kent, &AElig;thelbald may simply have required the payment of tribute and some measure of deference, rather than control over routine land transactions. Eadberht at least is known to have attended &AElig;thelbald's court, for he attests a charter of the Mercian king that was issued in London in 748  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 91).<br>
<br>The death of &AElig;thelberht II in 762 precipitated a succession crisis in Kent. Over the next few years an unusually large number of charters were issued, making it possible to identify no fewer than five kings of Kent, evidently jockeying for power and attempting to win support through land-grants. In east Kent &AElig;thelberht was succeeded by <a name="cosubject_57718"></a><span class="headword">Eadberht II</span>  (<em>fl. </em>762&#150;763)<span class="occ"></span>, probably his son; but within two years Eadberht had been replaced by a certain <a name="cosubject_57719"></a><span class="headword">Eanmund</span>  (<em>fl. </em>763&#150;764)<span class="occ"></span>, who was in turn supplanted by <a name="cosubject_57720"></a><span class="headword">Heahberht</span>  (<em>fl. </em>764)<span class="occ"></span>. In west Kent Eardwulf does not seem to have survived 762; in his place there appeared a King <a name="cosubject_25534"></a><span class="headword">Sigered</span>  (<em>fl. </em>762&#150;765)<span class="occ"></span>, who in one charter is explicitly called &#145;king of half Kent&#146; and whose name suggests that he may have had some connection with the East Saxon royal dynasty. By 765 Sigered had also been swept away, and west Kent was in the hands of King <a name="cosubject_57721"></a><span class="headword">Ecgberht II</span>  (<em>fl. </em>765&#150;779)<span class="occ"></span>, who was destined to cling to power for very much longer than his immediate predecessors.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the new king of the Mercians, Offa, had taken advantage of the political turmoil to impose his overlordship on Kent; in 765 he issued a charter directly concerning land in Kent which was effectively a confirmation of a charter of Sigered  (<span class="italic">AS chart.</span>, S 105). But Offa's growing control over the kingdom seems to have received a sudden check in 776. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> records that in that year a battle took place at Otford in Kent between the Mercians and the men of Kent, but does not mention the outcome. Most later medieval historians assumed that Offa was victorious, but it has been pointed out that there is no evidence for Mercian overlordship in Kent in the years immediately after that battle; instead, there are charters issued by King Ecgberht II in 778 and 779 and by a King <a name="cosubject_57722"></a><span class="headword">Ealhmund</span>  (<em>fl. </em>784)<span class="occ"></span> in 784 which make no reference at all to Offa. There is now general agreement that the men of Kent, probably led by King Ecgberht, rebelled against Mercian rule in 776 and succeeded in winning independence from Offa for almost a decade. Ecgberht seems to have become king of the whole of Kent (the fate of Heahberht is uncertain); there survive about a dozen coins in his name, probably struck at Canterbury, which are some of the earliest examples of a new silver coinage based on Carolingian weights (the dating of these coins is uncertain and they may belong to the period before the battle of Otford; there is a single example in the name of Heahberht). Ealhmund was probably Ecgberht's successor (and apparently the father of the future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8581/', "King Ecgberht")</script> who was to rule Wessex from 802 until his death in 839). But Offa's power could not be withstood for much longer, and by 785 he had reimposed his control on the kingdom. In that year he issued the first of a series of charters making direct grants of land in Kent, without reference to any native ruler; it is to be assumed that Ealhmund had been killed or driven out. From 785 until the 820s Kent was treated as a province of the Mercian kingdom; only in 796&#150;8 was there a brief resurgence of Kentish independence, when <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8378/', "Eadberht Pr&#230;n")</script> (perhaps a descendant of the ancient Kentish dynasty) ruled for a short time as king of Kent.<br>
