<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carte,  Richard D'Oyly</span>  (1844&#150;1901), <span class="occ">theatre impresario</span>, was born on 3 May 1844 in Greek Street, Soho, London, the son of Richard Carte (<i>d</i>. 1891) (originally Cart; he frenchified the surname) and his wife, Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. The name D'Oyly, arising from his mother's side, was a forename (not part of a double surname), by which he was addressed. He matriculated at University College, London, in 1861 but left his studies to join his father's firm of Rudall, Carte &amp; Co., well-known makers of woodwind instruments. From within his father's firm, then from an adjacent address in Craig's Court, Charing Cross, he set up a management agency for musical performers: some two hundred instrumentalists and singers (including those of such distinction as Adelina Patti and Clara Schumann, the widow of the composer) appear on his prospectus of the late 1870s.<br>
<br>A dilettante composer, Carte published a few songs and other pieces. Three light operas composed by him were produced in London: <span class="italic">Dr Ambrosias: his Secret</span> (1868), <span class="italic">Marie</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">Happy Hampstead</span> (1877, preceded by provincial tour). His commanding role, however, was to be in theatrical promotion. As lessee and manager of London's Opera Comique between June and October 1874, he presented a Brussels company in <span class="italic">Girofl&eacute;-Girofl&agrave;</span> (its first staging in Britain) by one of the most popular composers of French operetta, Lecocq. An English adaptation of Gaston Serpette's <span class="italic">La branche cass&eacute;e</span> followed, and Carte announced his ambition &#145;to establish in London a permanent abode for light opera&#146;. Not French but British works were, however, to provide his route.<br>
<br>In 1875 Selina Dolaro, a musical actress who headed her own company, installed him as manager of the Royalty Theatre for a run of Offenbach's operetta <span class="italic">La P&eacute;richole</span>. To fill out the evening Carte suggested that <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26772/', "Arthur Sullivan")</script> should set <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33400/', "W. S. Gilbert's")</script> <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span>, a libretto originally intended for Carl Rosa. While it was in gestation other works plugged the gap, but these were eclipsed by the brilliant success of <span class="italic">Trial by Jury</span> on its first performance on 25 March 1875. Carte needed no further prompting to pursue the long-term promotion of Gilbert and Sullivan's works (and others compatible with them). He organized a syndicate, the Comedy Opera Company, which financed <span class="italic">The Sorcerer</span> in 1877 and <span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span> in 1878. In 1879 he obtained sole control, and &#145;Mr R. D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company&#146; (as it was thenceforward known) presented all the subsequent joint theatrical works of the pair.<br>
<br>To counter a wave of unauthorized (pirated) American productions of <span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span>, Carte went to New York with Gilbert and Sullivan and presented his own production there in 1879, followed by its successor <span class="italic">The Pirates of Penzance</span> (prior to its London production). The financial rewards of the operettas enabled Carte to construct a new London theatre, the Savoy, which opened on 10 October 1881 with a transfer from the Opera Comique of the newest Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, <span class="italic">Patience</span>. The most up-to-date and comfortable of all London theatres, the Savoy was claimed as the world's first public building to be lit entirely by electric light.<br>
<br>The label of &#145;Savoy Operas&#146; was thenceforward most commonly used to identify Gilbert and Sullivan's works, though it was also applied by Carte to other operettas he later presented at that theatre. His contractual arrangement with his two colleagues (from 1883) was as follows. For an annual rent, Carte formally let the theatre to a partnership of himself, Sullivan, and Gilbert; once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each was entitled to one-third of the profits. For his part, Carte had the right to demand a new work from his creative partners at six months' notice.<br>
<br>Continuity of style was assured by the maintenance of what was, in effect, a permanent company of soloists and chorus; such soloists as Jessie Bond, George Grossmith, and Rutland Barrington won their own following. Long runs became an expectation: <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> (14 March 1885) set a London theatrical record with 672 performances. Carte's meticulous standards of staging and dresses were extended to the supporting companies which he sent to tour the repertory in the provinces. Thus his monopoly of the works was reaffirmed while a national taste was formed for them.<br>
<br>Carte also took a company from London to give the first New York performance of <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> on 19 August 1885 and then accompanied almost the same set of artists to Berlin and other continental cities. Vienna's leading critic, Eduard Hanslick, reviewing <span class="italic">The Mikado</span> in September 1886, specifically noted that its &#145;unparalleled success&#146; was owing not merely to the libretto or the music or both together but also to &#145;the wholly original stage performance, unique of its kind, by Mr D'Oyly Carte's artists &hellip; riveting the eye and ear with its exotic allurement&#146;. There was a further continental tour in 1887.<br>
<br>As up-to-date as his London theatre was the new, luxurious Savoy Hotel built by Carte: it opened in 1889, the year of Gilbert and Sullivan's <span class="italic">The Gondoliers</span>. The creative partnership was by then under strain, Sullivan wishing to move away from operetta towards grand opera; Carte, with every confidence, resolved to build a new theatre to launch that enterprise. In the meantime Gilbert had precipitately accused Carte of cheating on the accounts, provoking the so-called &#145;carpet quarrel&#146;, the issue being whether a front-of-house carpet could be included in production expenses. An astonished public beheld the partnership in tatters, Gilbert challenging Carte in a legal action spanning from July to September 1890, with Sullivan on Carte's side. The legal result was inconclusive, the artistic consequences lamentable.<br>
<br>Estranged from Gilbert, Sullivan conducted his grand opera, <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>, at the opening of Carte's new theatre, the Royal English Opera House (now the Palace Theatre, Cambridge Circus), on 31 January 1891. Defying grand opera custom, Carte presented <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> not in repertory with other works but in a continuous run, with multiple casting of leading roles. It was the sole major failure of his career: the total of 160 performances exceeded any precedent for such a work but the run was insufficient to cover the financial costs. He had no other opera to replace <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> immediately, and its eventual successor, Messager's <span class="italic">La Basoche</span>, likewise failed (though much praised by Bernard Shaw). Late in 1892 Carte sold the theatre to Sir Augustus Harris, his only rival in vigour of theatrical promotion.<br>
<br>On 24 August 1870 Carte married Blanche Julia Prowse, who died in 1885; on 12 April 1888, at the Chapel of the Savoy, he married his professional assistant, known as Helen Lenoir (really Susan Helen Couper Black) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59169/', "Carte, Helen (1852&#150;1913)")</script>], whose work both before and after her marriage to Carte identifies her as one of the most remarkable of Victorian businesswomen. Her decisive managerial role in relation to both Sullivan and Gilbert is evident from the time of the carpet quarrel; the subsequent reconciliation of composer and librettist and the mounting of their two final collaborations (<span class="italic">Utopia Limited</span> and <span class="italic">The Grand Duke</span>) devolved largely on her as Carte became increasingly ill.<br>
<br>Neither of these operettas renewed the spell which Gilbert and Sullivan had once exerted on the public. No longer able to depend on their joint output to fill the Savoy, Carte produced new operettas by Sullivan with other librettists (<span class="italic">Haddon Hall</span>, 1892; <span class="italic">The Chieftain</span>, 1894; <span class="italic">The Beauty Stone</span>, 1897; <span class="italic">The Rose of Persia</span>, 1899) and extended the repertory to other composers, including Messager (<span class="italic">Mirette</span>, 1894) and Alexander Mackenzie (<span class="italic">His Majesty</span>, 1897). None of these had much success.<br>
<br>From the time of his second marriage Carte lived at 4 Adelphi Terrace, in the area of the Savoy, with a handsome summer residence on an island in the Thames at Weybridge, Surrey. He died at his London home from dropsy and heart disease on 3 April 1901. At the same time as he was buried, on 6 April at Fairlight church, Hastings, a memorial service for him was held at the Chapel Royal of the Savoy. Despite the disastrous enterprise of his Royal English Opera, he left some &pound;250,000, twice the amount of Gilbert's legacy and more than four times Sullivan's.<br>
<br>After Helen Carte's death in 1913, control of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, as it was later styled, passed to Rupert D'Oyly Carte (1876&#150;1948), a son of Carte's first marriage, and then to Rupert's daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31046/', "Bridget D'Oyly Carte (1908&#150;1985)")</script>. The company continued under the family's management, but with a final change of name to the D'Oyly Carte Trust, until 1982.<br>
