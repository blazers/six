<span class="headword">Shirley,  Evelyn Philip</span>  (1812&#150;1882), <span class="occ">antiquary and genealogist</span>, was born in South Audley Street, London, on 22 January 1812, the eldest son of Evelyn John Shirley (1788&#150;1856) of Ettington Park, Warwickshire (the Shirleys were a branch of the family of the earls Ferrers). His mother was Eliza (<i>d</i>. 1859), only daughter of Arthur Stanhope. He was educated at a preparatory school at Twyford, near Winchester, and afterwards by a private tutor. In 1826 he went to Eton College. He matriculated as a gentleman commoner from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 15 October 1830, graduated BA in 1834, and proceeded MA in 1837.<br>
<br>Shirley owned property at Lough Fea in co. Monaghan, Ettington in Warwickshire, and Houndshill on the borders of Worcestershire. After he succeeded his father, he made considerable alterations to Ettington Park. Here, and at Lough Fea, he built up a large library and picture collection. Benjamin Disraeli portrayed Shirley in <span class="italic">Lothair</span> as Mr Ardenne, &#145;a man of ancient pedigree himself, who knew everybody else's&#146;.<br>
<br>Shirley was a Conservative, who opposed the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, and believed in the union of secular and religious education. However, he, unlike his father, was tolerant towards the Catholic priesthood on his co. Monaghan estate. He was MP for co. Monaghan from 1841 to 1847, and from 1853 to 1865 he represented Warwickshire South. In 1837 Shirley was high sheriff for co. Monaghan, and in 1867 he became high sheriff for Warwickshire.<br>
<br>Shirley's first interest, however, was genealogy and local history, and he rarely took part in parliamentary debates. He wrote a number of books and articles on the history of the Shirley family and their estates, both in England and Ireland. He also wrote on the Church of Ireland and on genealogy. He was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. Shirley was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and a corresponding member of the New England Historic Genealogical Society. In 1881 he was awarded an honorary LLD at Dublin. He was also a trustee of Rugby School and of the National Portrait Gallery.<br>
<br>On 4 August 1842 Shirley married Mary Clara Elizabeth (1823&#150;1894), eldest daughter of Sir Edmund Hungerford Lechmere. She greatly encouraged the school of Irish lace that was established at Carrickmacross, near Lough Fea. They had three daughters and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100966/', "Sewallis Evelyn Shirley")</script>, who founded the Kennel Club. Shirley died at Ettington Park on 19 September 1882, and was buried there in the family vault on 26 September.<br>
