<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barbour, Sir  David Miller</span>  (1841&#150;1928), <span class="occ">administrator in India and writer on monetary issues</span>, was born at Omagh, co. Tyrone, Ireland, on 29 December 1841, the fifth child of Miller Barbour and his wife, Margaret Denny, into an established family of farmers and small landowners at Calkill, near Omagh. He was educated at Omagh Academy and Queen's College, Belfast, graduating in 1862 with a BA from the Queen's University of Ireland.<br>
<br>Barbour passed sixth in order of merit into the Indian Civil Service in 1862, taking first place in the examination in mathematics [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>]. He arrived in India in December 1863, and was posted to Bengal. He became under-secretary to the government of India in the finance department in 1872 and subsequently held the posts of accountant-general in the Punjab, Madras, and Bengal, then acted as secretary to the government of Bengal in the finance department and later in the revenue and general department. In 1880, following the Second Anglo-Afghan War and the British occupation of Kabul and Kandahar, he published a pamphlet under the initials D. B. entitled <span class="italic">Our Afghan Policy and the Occupation of Candahar</span> calling for a prompt withdrawal from Afghanistan. In 1882 Barbour was awarded the honorary degree of LLD by the Royal University of Ireland, which superseded the Queen's University in that year, and in 1883 he married Katherine Constance, daughter of Thomas Gribble, who had been connected with the wine trade in Portugal.<br>
<br>In 1882 Barbour also returned to the government of India as secretary in the department of finance and commerce. For the next decade the financial and currency problems of India were the subject of intense international discussion and debate, as her economic history was dominated by the decline in the price of silver bullion against that of gold. This change in the relative prices of the two precious metals on which the world's currency systems depended had been precipitated by the abandonment of the silver standard by Germany and the United States, which led to a fall in the price of silver relative to gold, unseating the apparently stable ratio of 15&frac12; to 1 that had been effective for most of the previous century. The result of these changes in India, where the silver rupee remained tied to the gold price of its silver-bullion content, was to devalue the currency sharply against sterling and to increase the exchange costs of the transfers that the government of India had to make to meet its considerable expenditure in Britain. This also increased the transfer costs of servicing private investment, which, coupled to the uncertainty of the exchange rate, may have deterred British capital from investing in India. While devaluation also had some small impact on the international prices of India's main exports of agricultural produce and imports of manufactured goods, the effect of this was masked by the global price fall in the period brought about by increased productivity, reduced shipping costs, and fluctuations in the world supply of monetary gold and other instruments of international liquidity.<br>
<br>Barbour feared that a continued fall in the price of silver against gold would lead to a depression in the Indian domestic economy, limiting the spread of commercialization and the use of money. Thus he argued consistently in favour of a return to bimetallism&#151;the use of both precious metals at a stable exchange rate in international monetary transactions&#151;and was one of the substantial minority (five out of twelve) of the royal commission on gold and silver in 1886 that argued in favour of such a system. However, he knew that bimetallism could only be re-established by virtually unanimous international agreement, and that it was very unlikely that such an agreement could ever be secured. The gold and silver commission reported in 1888 and on 22 November of that year Barbour became finance member of the governor-general's council. He was made KCSI on 1 January 1889.<br>
<br>The continued fall in the gold price of silver, and the failure of any international agreement to remedy the situation, made the financial position of the government of India extremely precarious in the early 1890s. As Barbour himself recognized, and pointed out in introducing the Indian budget for 1891&#150;2, India was being forced onto the gold standard for lack of any alternative. To achieve this meant closing the Indian mints to the free coinage of silver, so that the token value of the rupee could rise above its bullion value, and this step was taken on 26 June 1893, when the mints were closed following the report of a special Indian currency committee chaired by Lord Herschell. Barbour resigned from the Indian Civil Service and left India in November 1893, but in 1898 he was appointed to the committee on Indian currency chaired by Sir Henry Fowler, which reported in 1899 with a recommendation that the exchange value of the rupee be formally stabilized at the rate of 15 rupees to the pound, with gold sovereigns being free to circulate in India at that rate, and that action be taken to build up the sterling and gold reserves of the government of India to establish international confidence in the currency. The effect of these measures was to establish a gold exchange system in India, by which silver rupees circulated as a token currency, supported in a fixed exchange rate with sterling by currency reserves in London, and an alliance between British financial institutions and the colonial authorities to manage the market in foreign exchange. Subsequently, Barbour acted as chairman of committees set up to consider the currency problems of the west African colonies and protectorates and the Straits Settlements, and recommended that a similar system to the one operating in India be introduced into these territories.<br>
<br>In the 1890s and 1900s Barbour served on a wide variety of committees and commissions of imperial importance, for which he was made KCMG in 1899. In 1894 he was a member of the royal commission on the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland and wrote a minute of dissent distinguishing himself, as a keen Ulsterman, from the home-rule sentiments of the majority. In 1896 he was a member of the royal commission that reported on the economic condition and prospects of the British West Indies; in 1899 he reviewed the financial problems of Jamaica, urging much greater prudence in the colony's affairs; and in 1900 he reported on the financial situation of the newly conquered South African Boer republics of the Orange River and the Transvaal. In 1903&#150;5 he served as chairman of the royal commission on London traffic; in 1906&#150;9 he was a member of the royal commission on shipping rings, for which he wrote a minority report demanding action to ensure greater competition; and in 1907&#150;8 he was a member of the committee on Indian finance and administration chaired by Lord Inchcape. Barbour also pursued a successful career in business, joining the board of the East Indian Railway Company in 1895, becoming deputy chairman in 1917, and chairman from 1919 to 1924. He was also a director of the Standard Bank of South Africa from 1901 until 1927.<br>
<br>Barbour's last intervention in the making of imperial financial and monetary policy came with the evidence he gave to the committee on Indian exchange and currency in 1919 (the Babbington-Smith committee), in which he was one of those who argued strongly that the fixed exchange rate system for the rupee, which had lapsed owing to the strains of wartime finance, and the rise in world silver prices coupled to the fall in the gold value of the pound sterling after 1918, should not be reimposed at a new rate until the disturbed and difficult conditions of the post-war world had become stabilized. This case was weakened, however, by the absence of any strong recommendation as to what a suitable future exchange rate or standard might be, and was ignored in the committee's final proposals for a gold-standard rupee at a new rate of 10 rupees to the gold pound. The subsequent failure of the Indian monetary authorities to implement this policy, and the dramatic decline of the rupee exchange rate to well below its pre-war parity, showed just how disturbed international conditions had become, and the rupee was not finally stabilized on a fixed exchange rate with sterling until 1927.<br>
<br>Barbour's lifelong interest in international monetary issues was demonstrated by the three books he published on the subject of bimetallism: <span class="italic">The Theory of Bimetallism</span> (1885), <span class="italic">The Standard of Value</span> (1912), which was an account of his tenure as finance member in India, and <span class="italic">The Influence of the Gold Supply on Profits and Prices</span> (1913). He died on 12 February 1928 at his home, Tiltwood, Crawley Down, Sussex, and was survived by his wife, three sons, and one daughter.<br>
