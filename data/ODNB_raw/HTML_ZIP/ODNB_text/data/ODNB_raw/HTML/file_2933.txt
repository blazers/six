<span class="headword">Boscawen,  Hugh</span>, first Viscount Falmouth  (<em>c.</em>1680&#150;1734), <span class="occ">politician and courtier</span>, was the eldest surviving son of Edward Boscawen (1628&#150;1685), a wealthy Turkey merchant and MP, and his wife, Jael (<i>d</i>. 1730), the daughter of Sir Francis Godolphin. Both parents were of prominent Cornish landed families, and their connections at the very heart of politics ensured the future path of Boscawen's own career. His mother was the sister of Lord Godolphin and a friend of Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, while his uncle Hugh Boscawen, a county MP for Cornwall, served as a privy councillor under William III. At a young age Boscawen inherited his father's considerable fortune and Cornish estates. In 1698, a year after matriculating at King's College, Cambridge, he was appointed a groom of the bedchamber to the young duke of Gloucester. His marriage took place on 23 April 1700 in Henry VII's chapel, Westminster Abbey, to Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1754), the daughter of Colonel Charles Godfrey, master of the jewel office. The couple had eighteen children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2931/', "Edward Boscawen (1711&#150;1761)")</script>, admiral. It was a promising match, for Boscawen's mother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5394/', "Arabella Churchill")</script>, was the sister of the earl of Marlborough. The death of his uncle Hugh in 1701 brought Boscawen possession of extensive Cornish estates worth &pound;3000 per annum as well as influence in many of Cornwall's twenty-two parliamentary boroughs.<br>
<br>At Queen Anne's accession in 1702 Boscawen was appointed a groom of the bedchamber to Prince George and entered parliament for the family borough of Tregony. Not surprisingly, he was a devoted supporter of the Godolphin&#150;Marlborough ministry (1702&#150;10), and throughout the reign he co-ordinated the whig electoral campaigns in Cornwall, frequently at his own expense. Having been elected for the county in 1705, he was in 1708 appointed warden of the stannaries and high steward of the duchy of Cornwall. His career was curtailed under Oxford's tory ministry (1710&#150;14), when he served once more as a borough MP, first for Truro (1710), then for Penryn (1713), but upon the accession of George I his services in the whig cause were acknowledged in his appointment as comptroller of the household and as a privy councillor. In 1717 he received the lucrative sinecure appointment of joint vice-treasurer of Ireland. Having supported the Sunderland&#150;Stanhope ministry, he was created Viscount Falmouth in 1720, but lost his position at court. Beyond the realms of electoral management his exploits as a politician were invariably blundering, and he was little valued by Sunderland's successor, Walpole. Smouldering annoyance finally goaded him into joining the opposition in the House of Lords in 1733. He died suddenly of an &#145;apoplexy&#146; on 25 October 1734 at Trefusis, Cornwall, a few months after being dismissed from his remaining offices, and was buried on 6 November at St Michael's, Penkevil. His wife, previously a maid of honour to Queen Anne, died on 22 March 1754 and was buried at Penkevil on 2 April.<br>
