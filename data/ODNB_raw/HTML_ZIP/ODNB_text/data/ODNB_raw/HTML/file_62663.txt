<span class="headword">Cheny,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1727&#150;1750), <span class="occ">writer on horse-racing</span>, hailed from the Arundel area of Sussex. Little else is known about him save that in 1727 he compiled the first version of the <span class="italic">Racing Calendar</span>, which for over 200 years has been the official public organ of the Jockey Club. His title-page for the initial volume was an all-encompassing table of contents:<blockquote>An Historical List or Account of all the Horse-Matches run and of all the Plates and Prizes run for in England (of the value of ten pounds or upwards) in 1727, containing the names of the owners of the horses etc., that have run, as above, and the names and colours of the horses also, with the winner distinguished of every match, plate, prize, or stakes; the conditions of running, as to weight, age, size, etc., and the places in which the losing horses have come in. (Cheny, title-page)</blockquote>Put more simply, it was a gentleman's guide to &#145;matching or betting with greater advantage&#146;, by the provision of knowledge of form, albeit somewhat dated, and breeding.<br>
<br>Cheny funded the calendar by asking subscribers for a seven-year commitment with a half-crown to be paid with the order, 5<i>s</i>. annually for the first six years, and, as a reward for loyalty, only a further half-crown in the seventh year. This sum was to be paid to various named persons but could also be given personally to the author &#145;as he travels to take his accounts&#146;  (Cheny). In fact Cheny rode all over England to attend race meetings, obtain breeding information, and solicit subscriptions. He continued to publish his calendar until 1750, some twenty-four issues in total. From 1743 these included particulars of the pedigrees of all the significant racehorses of the day.<br>
<br>Sadly Cheny's name features in few histories of horse-racing, not least because James Weatherby, who later took on the task of producing the <span class="italic">Racing Calendar</span>, appropriated all the information in Cheny's publication without giving any acknowledgement. He mentioned Cheny only once, in his preface to the 1791 edition, where he remarked that Cheny was in error in his identification of the sires of two particular horses. Ironically most turf enthusiasts falsely identify the <span class="italic">Racing Calendar</span> with Messrs Weatherby, its publishers for over two centuries, and not with Cheny whose entrepreneurial ability coupled with his racing intelligence launched the racing fraternity's bible. Even Charles Prior, the historian of the <span class="italic">Racing Calendar</span>, who acknowledges Cheny's pioneering work, misspells his name as Cheney.<br>
