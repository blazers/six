<span class="headword">Black,  John</span>  (1783&#150;1855), <span class="occ">journalist and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 7 November 1783 in a poor cottage on a farm called Burnhouses, 4 miles north of Duns in Berwickshire. His father, Ebenezer Black, had been a pedlar in Perthshire, but in the decline of life he accepted employment at Burnhouses, and married Janet Gray, another worker on the farm. Four years after the marriage Janet was left a widow with one daughter and a son, John, and before the boy reached the age of twelve, his mother and sister had died. He was taken in by his mother's brother John Gray, a labourer on the same farm, who sent him to the parish school at Duns. Black gained there a knowledge of English, Latin, and Greek. He made many friends at Duns, among them James Gray, poet and missionary, and James Cleghorn, actuary. At the age of thirteen Black was articled by his uncle to Mr Turnbull, a writer of Duns, with whom he remained until 1800. During this time he borrowed extensively from the subscription library in the town, and formed a very creditable collection of his own, beginning the habit of book collecting that was to become so important in his adult life. He accepted a well-paid clerkship in the branch bank of the British Linen Company, but was obliged to leave the town on account of a practical joke played upon one of the &#145;respectabilities&#146;.<br>
<br>Black found a situation in Edinburgh in the office of Mr Selkrig, an accountant, who allowed his clerk time to attend classes at the university. Black's official duties were strictly performed, his attendance in the lecture-rooms never failed, and he undertook any remunerative work that was offered, notably some translations from the German for Sir David Brewster's <span class="italic">Edinburgh Cyclopaedia</span>. He met with an intellectual companion in William Mudford, the son of a London shopkeeper. <span class="italic">Cobbett's Weekly Political Register</span> was then a popular serial, and there Black and Mudford engaged in another &#145;battle of the books&#146;, the former defending ancient classical study, the latter insisting on the acquisition of modern learning as better.<br>
<br>In Edinburgh the hot-tempered Black is reported to have delivered a dozen challenges before he was thirty years old. His schoolfellow James Gray was now classical master at Edinburgh high school, and exercised a moderating influence upon him. In 1809 Black became engaged to a lady from Carlisle, but broke off the engagement when an expected increase of income did not materialize. This seemed to have had a demoralizing effect upon Black. He fell into low company and bad habits, quarrelled with his employer, from whom he was receiving a salary of &pound;150 a year, and distressed his best friends.<br>
<br>William Mudford was then in London and editor of the <span class="italic">Universal Magazine</span>, to which Black contributed articles on the Italian drama and on German literature from 1807 to 1809. It was through Mudford's persuasion that Black left Edinburgh for London in 1810. Charles Mackay gives as a doubtful statement of Black himself, that he walked with a few pence in his pocket all the way from Berwickshire to London, subsisting on the hospitality of farmers. He carried a letter of introduction to Robert Hartley Cromek, engraver and publisher, who received him at once into his friendly home. Three months after his arrival in London Black was engaged as a reporter and translator of foreign correspondence by James Perry, who, with an assistant master at Charterhouse School named Gray, had in 1789 become the proprietor of the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. Black's longer translations included <span class="italic">Humboldt's Political Essay on New Spain</span> (4 vols., 1811&#150;12), <span class="italic">Travels in Norway and Lapland, by Leopold von Buch</span> (1813), <span class="italic">Berzelius on a System of Mineralogy</span>, and <span class="italic">Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature</span> (1814).<br>
<br>Black's first marriage, in December 1812, was to the mistress of a London friend, after a five-month courtship promoted and encouraged by the duplicitous pair. The union was extremely unhappy, as his wife made no pretence of love for him, and in the space of two months she had involved him in debt, sold some of his furniture, and clandestinely renewed acquaintance with her former lover. In February 1813 she left Black, and in 1814 he sought a divorce. An arrangement was made that she should go to Scotland and be domiciled there long enough to sue for a divorce on her petition. The project, however, failed, the proof of domicile of both parties not being deemed adequate by the court. Black, in full expectation of a divorce, had offered marriage to an old friend, a &#145;Miss Cromeck&#146;, possibly a relative of his former employer who became his housekeeper and bore the name of Mrs Black. The undivorced wife continued to extract money from her husband, and this persecution went on for many years. This episode in Black's life explains the disorganization of his official labours which led to a quarrel with James Perry, but due explanation being given, the breach was healed. In 1817 Perry's health was giving way, and the functions of editor gradually devolved on Black.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> was the most uncompromising of all the opposition papers, and Black maintained its position, greatly assisted by the counsels of James Mill. John Stuart Mill wrote of Black:<blockquote>I have always considered Black as the first journalist who carried criticism &amp; the spirit of reform into the details of English institutions. Those who are not old enough to remember those times can hardly believe what the state of public discussion then was. People now &amp; then attacked the Constitution &amp; the boroughmongers but none thought of censuring the law or the courts of justice &amp; to say a word against the unpaid magistracy was a sort of blasphemy. Black was the writer who carried the warfare into these subjects &hellip; And by doing this he broke the spell. (<span class="italic">Later Letters</span>, 978&#150;80)</blockquote>Black's methods were also admired by Jeremy Bentham, who called him &#145;the greatest publicist yet produced in Great Britain&#146;  (Escott, 159). At the outset of his editorial career Black attracted much public attention by his determined condemnation of the conduct of the authorities in the Peterloo massacre (16 August 1819), and he was denigrated for this by Cobbett's <span class="italic">Register</span> as &#145;Doctor Black the feel-osopher&#146;. In the matter of Queen Caroline's trial the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> leaned to the unpopular side, deeming the queen guilty, and the circulation of the paper was greatly diminished.<br>
<br>In 1821 Perry died, and his executors sold for &pound;42,000 the newspaper which thirty years before had been bought for &pound;150. Black retained his post of editor, but the new proprietor, William Innell Clement, owner also of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and of <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span>, had not the public spirit of his predecessor, and the paper began to decline in commercial terms. In 1834 it was again sold, for the sum of &pound;16,500, to Sir John Easthope and two partners. <span class="italic">The Times</span> had outdistanced the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> when, by shifting its politics in 1835 to support Sir Robert Peel's tory ministry, it caused great numbers of its whig subscribers to abandon it and support the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>. This was a turn of events that greatly pleased Black, as his rivalry with Sterling of <span class="italic">The Times</span> had been intense, and may have suggested the battles of Pott and Slurk in <span class="italic">The Pickwick Papers</span>.<br>
<br>In November 1835 Black demonstrated that his hot temper and keen sense of honour had not been characteristics merely of his youth, as he fought a duel with John Arthur Roebuck. The latter had published a pamphlet in which cowardice was attributed to the editor of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>. Although shots were fired at the meeting, no one was injured.<br>
<br>When Lord Melbourne returned to office (8 April 1835) he found a useful ally and a congenial companion in Black, who supported the ministry with all his powers, and wrote some especially vigorous articles against Sir Robert Peel in 1839. During his next administration, Melbourne professed a desire to serve Black, who declined the offer on the ground that he &#145;lived happily on his income&#146;. &#145;Then by &#151; I envy you&#146;, said the peer, &#145;and you're the only man I ever did.&#146; Black did not get on quite so well with Lord Palmerston. He once exasperated the busy foreign secretary by launching out into half an hour's dissertation on the ethnological peculiarities of the Finnish, when the business of the interview was simply to know what the government meant to do at a certain crisis in foreign affairs. Lord Brougham was very intimate with &#145;Dear Doctor&#146;, as he styled Black, a title derisively applied by Cobbett, and so distasteful to Black.<br>
<br>It was Black's great pleasure to encourage the ambitions of the young writers around him, and among others those of Charles Dickens, who began his literary career as a reporter for the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>. As late as the year of his death, Dickens remembered Black as &#145;my first hearty out-and-out appreciator&#146;  (Forster, 1.65).<br>
<br>Latterly there was thought to be a decline of energy in the management of the paper, and in 1843 Black received an intimation that his resignation would be accepted. Black, who was now sixty years old, had saved no money, and had to part with his beloved library of some 30,000 volumes. This product of a lifetime's book collecting had not always been augmented in the most straightforward manner. As James Grant puts it:<blockquote>it was an essential part of his creed that no book which he borrowed from a friend should ever be returned &hellip; The truth was that Mr Black never could part with any books that ever came into his possession,&#151;no matter by what means, or under what circumstances. (Grant, 1.285&#150;7)</blockquote>His rooms had reputedly been so full of books that he and his second wife had occasionally been &#145;obliged to creep into bed at the end, both sides being blocked up with dusty volumes of divinity and politics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Men of the time</span>).<br>
<br>After the difficult auction of his library, friends and admirers rallied round Black and a sum, to which the proprietors of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> contributed, was raised sufficient to buy him an annuity of &pound;150. His old friend Walter Coulson placed a comfortable cottage at Snodland, near Maidstone, at his disposal, and there Black passed the remaining twelve years of his life in the study of Greek, and in the practice of gardening. Black's Newfoundland dogs Cato and Plutus were as well known as himself; one of them rescued from the Thames a boy who subsequently attained a seat on the judicial bench. James Grant described Black in his latter years as having &#145;the blunt and bluff appearance of a thickset farmer &hellip; never seen in the streets without being accompanied by a large mastiff (? Newfoundland), and a robust stick in his hand&#146;. He died on 15 June 1855 at Birling, near Town Malling in Kent.<br>
