<span class="headword">Philips,  Peregrine</span>  (1623&#150;1691), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Amroth, Pembrokeshire, son of the vicar of that parish. He was educated first at the grammar school, Haverfordwest, later by Sir Edward Harley's private chaplain at Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire, and then by Dr William Thomas (afterwards bishop of St David's). He started at Oxford University, but his education there was interrupted by the outbreak of the civil war and he returned to Wales. He acted first as curate at Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, and was then admitted to the rectory of Llangwm in Pembrokeshire. Leading puritan gentlemen of the county&#151;Sir Hugh Owen, Sir Roger Lort, and Sir John Meyrick&#151;were impressed by his talents as a preacher in Welsh and English. They procured for him three livings, at Monkton, Cosheston, and St Mary's, Pembroke; at each of these he preached regularly every Sunday. During the civil-war siege of Pembroke, Philips probably lived at Monkton, just below the castle, but to much popular wonderment neither he nor his family was injured by the ordnance directed to and from it.<br>
<br>With Philips's radical puritanism the forces of political independency found much common ground. In May 1648, at Cromwell's request, he addressed the officers in command of forces sent to put down the insurrection in south-west Wales. Next summer he was asked by Cromwell to preach aboard the ships anchored at Milford Haven, which were preparing to carry troops for the reduction of Ireland. His services were also reported to have been required by the assize judges in three counties&#151;at Cardigan, Carmarthen, and Haverfordwest&#151;and he was a member of the committee for scandalous ministers in Pembrokeshire. But it is clear that Philips was not a zealot for doctrinal correctness, for in 1655 he appeared at court in Haverfordwest in support of Henry Hake, a heretical shoemaker of Goat Street in that town.<br>
<br>Perhaps in the late 1640s, Philips led a gathered church, but in June 1650 he was granted &pound;6 for the repair of the parsonage at Llangwm. This seems to indicate continued willingness both to preach in parish churches and to accept tithe payments. Indeed, Philips favoured the proposed amalgamation of the parish of Llangwm (valued then at &pound;20 per annum) with other smaller benefices and was in London on 8 July 1656 to receive the certificates of approval. Meanwhile, he and the several score members of his gathered church on 17 January 1656 signed <span class="italic">The Humble Representation and Address</span> to Cromwell, a work supportive of his government. The respect was evidently mutual, for on 1 July 1656 a government supporter, James Philips (mayor in 1656), advised the council of Haverfordwest &#145;to carry themselves as loving and respectful as may be to Mr Peregrine Phillips and his people and in a short time the town may receive much benefit thereby&#146;  (Charles, 152&#150;3).<br>
<br>Following his refusal to conform in 1662 Philips was ejected from Llangwm and settled at Dredgman Hill, a farm near Haverfordwest. Here he established a congregational meeting-place. In 1665, however, he is believed to have become pastor of the Green meeting founded in 1651 by Stephen Love, which met on Sunday evenings at St Thomas's Green in Haverfordwest. He was assisted in his continuing work by John Luntley, a feltmaker or hatter. His comparative wealth and notoriety earned him close attention from the authorities; he was charged with holding religious meetings on 4 June 1663 and 11 July 1669, both cases leading to imprisonment by the sessions. On the second occasion Bishop William Thomas is reported to have made &#145;considerable offers if he would conform&#146; but Philips refused  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 843). His house was licensed as a congregational meeting-place under the first declaration of indulgence (1672) and it is possible that he taught at a school at Haverfordwest in that year. In 1675 his church was mentioned by Henry Maurice of Abergavenny as meeting in or near Haverfordwest, though it was much reduced since the days of the <span class="italic">Humble Representation</span>, having been subjected to competition from the Quakers and heavy official pressure. Calamy and Palmer depict a pattern of harassment lasting many years, in which occasional periods of imprisonment were interspersed with repeated house searches, arrests, and fines.<br>
<br>Philips was certainly the leading congregationalist figure in west and central Pembrokeshire. He enjoyed the support of local gentlemen, most notably the owner of Dredgman Hill, Sir Herbert Perrot of Haroldston, who in his will of 1682 described him as his loving friend and bequeathed him &pound;5. Under the declaration of indulgence (1687) Philips acquired a licence for his own house and for another in Haverfordwest. Late in life, it was reported, he survived on &pound;8 a year, collected from the members of his congregation &#145;when the years and providence favours them, otherwise less&#146;  (Richards, <span class="italic">Wales under the Indulgence</span>, 162). Though willing to suffer privation for his religious beliefs, Philips continued eirenic in his outlook. Calamy reports that he &#145;took no small pleasure in reconciling differences&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 844). On 22 June 1691 the Common Fund voted him &pound;5 a year, but he died, probably at Dredgman Hill, on 17 September. There is a tradition that he was buried at Haroldston church.<br>
