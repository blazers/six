<span class="headword">Case,  Janet Elizabeth</span>  (1863&#150;1937), <span class="occ">classics teacher and journalist</span>, was born on 28 July 1863 at 117 Adelaide Road, Hampstead, London, the youngest of the six daughters of William Arthur Case (1818&#150;1872), schoolmaster and fellow of University College, London, and his wife, Sarah Wolridge Stansfeld, sister of Sir James Stansfeld, the radical politician. She was educated at her parents' co-educational school, Heath Brow, Hampstead, which her mother continued after William Case's death. When she entered Girton College to read classics in 1881 she had more grounding in the subject than was usual for girls at that time. She went on to obtain a first in part two of the tripos (philosophy) in 1885. This she was able to convert to an MA in 1907 when Trinity College, Dublin, offered suitably qualified Oxbridge women <i>quasi ad eundem</i> degrees. While she was at Girton she co-founded the college classical club in 1884 and was a member of Cambridge University Music Society, one of the few university societies open to women. She was remembered for her performances in Greek plays, taking the part of Electra in the college performance of 1883 and of Athena in Aeschylus' <span class="italic">Eumenides</span>, performed by the university in 1885.<br>
<br>On leaving Cambridge, Janet Case returned to live at home and teach classics. From 1887 to 1896 she was visiting classical mistress at Maida Vale high school. In addition she gave private tuition. One of her pupils, the artist Henry Holliday, said that he would &#145;learn Greek if he could find a lady like &#147;Athena or Electra&#148; and &hellip; was much surprised to find that she lived on the Heath, close by&#146;  (Margaret Llewelyn Davies to Helen McMorran, 23 July 1937, Girton College archives). Other pupils included Katherine Asquith, the widow of the Liberal prime minister's eldest son, Raymond, Lady Diana Cooper, and Virginia Woolf. Many pupils became lifelong friends, notably Virginia Woolf who, after an initial aversion to &#145;Case&#146;, came to regard her as not only an excellent teacher but also a valued critic, confidante, and support. She wrote Case's obituary notice in <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>Janet Case was a member of the Hellenic Society, and in 1905 published an edition, with notes, of Aeschylus' <span class="italic">Prometheus Bound</span>. However, as Virginia Woolf recorded, her Greek was &#145;connected with many things&#146;, most of which concerned humanitarian reform. She was an active suffragist and was involved with the newly founded Women's Co-operative Guild (WCG), of which her friend and Girton contemporary, Margaret Llewelyn Davies, was general secretary. She lectured for the guild on moral hygiene and on improved maternity care, and instructed WCG speakers on divorce law reform. She published a pamphlet which summarized the recommendations of the royal commission on divorce in 1912 and advocated the radical WCG proposal of appointing women assessors to the divorce court. As she grew older her political sympathies moved steadily to the left. In addition to her work for the WCG she became an active supporter of home rule for Ireland, and was a member of the Peace Pledge Union, and a Labour voter in a staunchly Conservative constituency.<br>
<br>In 1915, at the age of fifty-two, Janet Case's health broke down and she was forced to give up teaching and her active involvement in campaigning. During bouts of ill health she was cared for by her sister, with whom she shared a house in Hampstead. They were increasingly short of money, and Virginia and Leonard Woolf assisted them, the latter trying to find employment for Janet as a newspaper correspondent; however, her pacifist views found little sympathy in the post-war climate. In 1920 ill health and financial constraint forced the sisters to move to Surrey. Two years later an inheritance enabled them to build a small house at Lyndhurst in the New Forest. Here Janet Case lived very simply, devoting herself to her garden and the forest countryside. Her rural observations were published as weekly &#145;Country diaries&#146;, which she contributed to the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> for the last twelve years of her life.<br>
<br>Janet Case was described by contemporaries as tall, dignified, and classical looking, with an air of breeding and self-possession. Her friends valued her counsel as well as her lively sense of humour. Her scholarship was impeccable, but she was one of a group of Girtonians in the early 1880s for whom scholarship was not sufficient as an end in itself, and who went on to form a network of women closely involved in social reform. Janet Case died of cancer at her home, Hewers' Orchard, Minstead, Hampshire, on 15 July 1937. She did not adhere to any religious doctrine; Virginia Woolf described her as being too well educated to be a Christian, but she had devised her own funeral service with a text on gentleness and faith. She was instead, as her obituarist in the <span class="italic">Girton Review</span> described her, &#145;a rare humanist&#146;.<br>
