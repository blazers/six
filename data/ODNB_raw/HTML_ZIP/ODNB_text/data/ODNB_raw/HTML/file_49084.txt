<span class="headword">Alexander,  George William</span>  (1802&#150;1890), <span class="occ">banker and philanthropist</span>, was born on 25 April 1802 in Bunhill Row, London, the first of nine children, eight of whom survived to maturity, of William Alexander (1769&#150;1819), bill broker, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53243/', "Ann Alexander, n&#233;e Barber (1774/5&#150;1861)")</script>, of Eckington, east Derbyshire. At the age of four he was sent away to a boys' school in Rochester kept by his uncle, William Rickman, who maintained discipline by the use of the birch. Leaving school shortly before he was fourteen, he joined his father's firm of Alexander &amp; Co. in Lombard Street in the City of London. He worked half-days until he was fourteen and a half, and then became a regular full-time clerk. Part of his daily round was to take down the shutters and to sweep out the offices.<br>
<br>It was not a propitious time. Trading conditions were generally difficult in the aftermath of war with Napoleon and many firms failed. Then in 1819 William Alexander died and it was decided to carry on the business in the name of his widow. Ann was aided and advised by a former colleague of William's and by her eldest son, who was already showing promise of being a successful bill broker. From the age of seventeen until he was almost twenty-one he worked without a day's holiday, with the consequence that he suffered a severe breakdown for a time. On coming of age he was made a partner, and became head of the firm when his mother Ann retired in 1838.<br>
<br>Like many other bill brokers and bankers in the early years of the nineteenth century, the Alexanders were Quakers, and George William followed the example of the great Quaker entrepreneurs in taking over an existing, modest-sized family business and transforming it into a much larger enterprise. Bill brokers originally acted purely as agents, buying and selling bills of exchange on commission. Gradually, in the wake of the financial crisis of 1825, changed circumstances led Alexanders and other of the more significant houses to begin to trade as principals, buying bills for their own portfolio and financing them with balances left by bankers &#145;at call&#146;. In 1831 the firm obtained the right to discount bills for cash at the Bank of England and so could guarantee to repay loans taken. Thereafter progress was rapid and by 1847 the firm was sufficiently well known to be referred to in W. M. Thackeray's novel <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, in which John Sedley asserts that &#145;Alexander would cash my bill, down sir, down on the counter, sir&#146;  (Thackeray, <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, 373).<br>
<br>Under George William's direction Alexanders acquired a reputation for being prudently managed, and this undoubtedly helped him to bring the firm through the periodic financial crises that caused so many others to fail&#151;not least because official and other help was encouraged in time of need. In the crisis of 1866, their giant rival, Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., was refused accommodation by the Bank of England on the grounds that its business was unsound, and the company consequently collapsed. By taking advantage of the opportunities thus presented, Alexanders was able to establish itself as the leading private firm in the market. When the rise of the joint-stock discount companies posed a threat to the existence of the private firms, George William responded by amalgamating Alexanders for a period (1864&#150;77) with Cunliffes &amp; Co. Subsequently Alexanders came to rank alongside the National and the Union discount companies as one of the three leading discount houses.<br>
<br>George William followed Quaker tradition in his support for one of the great Victorian philanthropic movements, being for nearly forty years the &#145;indefatigable&#146; treasurer of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society  (Isichei, 184). Not content with the routine obligation to be included in a published list of subscribers, he opened his home&#151;&#145;An abode of spotless order and of industry and hospitality&#146;  (Dixon, 4)&#151;to a succession of runaway slaves and political refugees. He opposed moves towards free trade that would allow the import of cheap slave-grown sugar and in 1842 published his <span class="italic">Letters on the Slave Trade, Slavery and Emancipation</span>. In 1849&#150;50 he toured the West Indies to investigate conditions at first hand. He also had charitable interests closer to home and in 1848 was one of the founders of Victoria Park Hospital, London.<br>
<br>Alexander was married twice, first in 1835 to Sarah Cleverly Horsnaill (1801&#150;1843), with whom he had two sons and two daughters, and second in 1845 to Catherine Horsnaill (1806&#150;1878), possibly his first wife's cousin; they had a daughter. Both sons became partners in the firm. He lived first at The Willows, Stoke Newington, Middlesex, and then, from 1853, at Reigate, Surrey. He retired from business in 1883. Alexander died at his home, Woodhatch, Reigate, on 24 November 1890.<br>
<br>The firm that Alexander inherited and transformed was the only private discount house to convert successfully to a limited company before 1914: it became a public company in 1911, operating as Alexanders Discount Co. Ltd. It was still trading in 1995, as Alexanders Discount plc, the longest-surviving discount house.<br>
