<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hornby,  Albert Sydney</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Ash]</span>  (1898&#150;1978), <span class="occ">grammarian and lexicographer</span>, was born on 10 August 1898 at Melville Cottage, Garden Lane, Chester, the eldest of the four children of Joseph Sidney Hornby (1871&#150;1940), publisher's agent, and his wife, Margaret Ann Kitchen (1872&#150;1966). Joseph was a Methodist lay preacher and his son in due course married in the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Chester, though perhaps out of filial loyalty rather than from firm conviction. Hornby was never a regular churchgoer, and in later years he was a declared agnostic. Hornby attended Chester grammar school, and in 1919, after war service in the Royal Navy, entered University College, London, where he read English. He graduated in 1922, and the following year was recruited to teach English at the Oita Higher Commercial School on the island of Kyushu. Shortly after marrying Ida Louise Arnold (1896&#150;1940) on 17 January 1924, Hornby set out with her on the long sea-journey to Japan.<br>
<br>Hornby had been recruited to teach English literature, but he was quickly drawn to teaching language, recognizing that this was the more urgent need in Japanese schools and colleges. As he later recalled, &#145;I found that [my students] read with some understanding &hellip; but that their knowledge of the English language was very limited indeed. &hellip; they'd say to me, &#147;Where went you yesterday?&#148; and that kind of thing&#146;  (Hornby and Ruse, 2). He therefore decided to concentrate on language and leave the teaching of literature to the Japanese professors. It was the same sure sense of prior need which led him to support the movement for the reform of English language teaching in Japan led by Harold E. Palmer, who had been appointed linguistic adviser to the Japanese government in 1922, and who a year later was made director of the newly established Tokyo Institute for Research in English Teaching (IRET).<br>
<br>Though geographically remote from the centre of these developments, Hornby quickly began to acquire an understanding of linguistics, initially through reading. But he also started to correspond with Palmer, and &#145;through my correspondence with him I became more and more interested in linguistics, especially linguistic methodology&#146;  (Hornby and Ruse, 2). By 1931 Hornby was already publishing textbooks and was soon to contribute articles on linguistic themes to the IRET <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>. Palmer was sufficiently impressed to invite him, in the spring of that year, to help compile a list of &#145;collocations&#146;, or set phrases of various kinds. This project, which had been initiated at IRET in 1927, but to which Hornby made a major contribution, culminated in 1933 in the publication of the <span class="italic">Second Interim Report on English Collocations</span>, the first linguistically based analysis of English phraseology ever to appear. In 1934, and at Palmer's instigation, Hornby moved to Tokyo, followed by his wife and two daughters, Phyllis and Margaret. Later he held two posts simultaneously, one at the government school of foreign languages in Tokyo, the other at the Tokyo higher normal school, a leading teacher training institution.<br>
<br>As well as teaching, or supervising the teaching of others, at two centres, Hornby was now simultaneously engaged in research projects set up at the institute. Moreover, as Palmer's designated successor he eventually assumed other burdens as well. In March 1936 Palmer retired, and from one day to the next Hornby became <i>de facto</i> head of research at the institute, editor of its <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>, and the inheritor of plans&#151;already tentatively discussed with the Tokyo publisher Kaitakusha&#151;for a monolingual dictionary for advanced learners, eventually published in 1942 as the <span class="italic">Idiomatic and Syntactic English Dictionary (ISED)</span> and later, by Oxford University Press, as <span class="italic">A Learner's Dictionary of Current English</span> (1948).<br>
<br>The design of this dictionary and the leading role in its compilation and two subsequent revisions (Hornby's co-authors on <span class="italic">ISED</span> were Edward Gatenby and Harold Wakefield) are without doubt Hornby's greatest achievements, and those for which he is chiefly remembered. Yet here we are faced by a curious paradox. Although it would be no exaggeration to say that lexical research begun in the late 1920s (including the work on collocations already referred to) gave birth to English as a foreign language (EFL) lexicography, Hornby and Palmer do not seem to have become aware until about 1936 that nothing other than an innovative <i>dictionary</i> could draw together, satisfactorily for the student, the manifold details of structure and usage which the research had brought to light.<br>
<br>The actual direction taken by IRET research into the vocabulary of English also gave particular shape and emphasis to the design of the new work. Although the needs of its users as readers were not neglected, Hornby came to lay particular stress on their needs as writers. This emphasis partly came about through the attention given at IRET to research on &#145;vocabulary control&#146;, a systematic attempt to identify those relatively few words which carry the main burden of everyday communication. Though the vocabularies delimited in this way varied from 1000 to 3000 items, they were alike in containing a nucleus of &#145;structural&#146; words (prepositions, auxiliary verbs, articles, and so on) and of items which, while not structural, formed part of very many stock phrases. They included the &#145;heavy-duty&#146; verbs &#145;come&#146;, &#145;go&#146;, &#145;put&#146;, &#145;set&#146;, and &#145;take&#146;. Both these categories pose severe problems for learners attempting to write in English, and it is not surprising that information designed to help students overcome them should feature strongly in the new dictionary.<br>
<br>Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, British nationals were repatriated by the Japanese, in the first instance to the United States. As their mother, Ida, had died in 1940, Phyllis and Margaret Hornby were part of this early exodus, and were taken care of in America by a missionary family. In the meantime Hornby himself had been interned&#151;being confined in a German Jesuit monastery. Here he was well treated, and his friend and publisher Naoe Naganuma also did what he could to make conditions tolerable. Eventually Hornby was repatriated aboard the same Red Cross ship as the diplomatic staff.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1942, Hornby was recruited by the British Council and spent the rest of the war in Persia, teaching at the University of Tehran and at the Anglo-Persian Institute. It was in the council's offices in Tehran that Hornby met the vivacious and delightfully forthright Marian de la Motte (1899&#150;1987), daughter of Vital de la Motte. They married on 14 July 1944. It was Marian who decided that A. S. Hornby would henceforth become Ash, the nickname by which he was later universally known.<br>
<br>In 1945 Hornby was appointed to the headquarters of the British Council in London and to the not entirely congenial post of linguistic adviser. Remote from the classroom, and sensing that &#145;whatever knowledge I might possess was not being used in the right way&#146;, Hornby sought permission from the council to start up a periodical which, like the IRET <span class="italic">Bulletin</span>, would be devoted to problems of English language teaching  (Hornby, 3). <span class="italic">English Language Teaching</span>&#151;issued at low cost to make it accessible to the teachers of the third world with whom Hornby's sympathies chiefly lay, and with articles designed to appeal to teachers everywhere&#151;was duly launched under his editorship in October 1946. <span class="italic">English Language Teaching</span> (or <span class="italic">English Language Teaching Journal</span>, as it later became) eventually acquired a reputation for combining expert practical advice with contributions from linguists written in a style accessible to the lay reader. According to his daughter Phyllis, Hornby was also at this time making a major contribution to the BBC series <span class="italic">English by Radio</span> (for this reason often called <span class="italic">Hornby by Radio</span>), though in her view he never received official credit for his leading role.<br>
<br>In 1950 Hornby resigned as editor of <span class="italic">English Language Teaching</span> to concentrate on full-time writing. His publisher, Eric Parnwell, had suggested that he might like to work in the country, producing smaller, lower-level dictionaries based on the major work but also preparing a number of language courses, including the <span class="italic">Oxford Progressive English for Adult Learners</span>, a three-volume course published from 1954 onwards. For variety, Hornby occasionally undertook a long lecture tour overseas for the British Council. During the earlier part of this period Hornby and his wife were living at Shermanbury, in Surrey, but they later moved to Appledore, in Kent, and later still to Willersey, in Worcestershire. At Willersey, especially, Hornby was able to indulge to the full a lifelong passion for gardening.<br>
<br>In 1954 Hornby published <span class="italic">A Guide to Patterns and Usage in English</span>, a practical grammar whose approach to analysis and tabular style of presentation reflected the methods employed in the <span class="italic">Advanced Learner's Dictionary</span> (as it was now named). The patterns were also a central feature of <span class="italic">Oxford Progressive English</span> and of his practical coursebook for teachers, <span class="italic">The Teaching of Structural Words and Sentence Patterns</span> (1959&#150;62).<br>
<br>The intense activity characteristic of Hornby in his fifties and sixties is somehow at odds with the genial but mild and self-effacing teacher and scholar who appears in photographs taken in an <span class="italic">English by Radio</span> studio or during an overseas lecture tour. But a kind of quiet tenacity was needed to carry through the ambitious projects of the post-war years, a period in which he completed one radical revision of the <span class="italic">Advanced Learner's Dictionary</span> (in 1963) almost single-handed, and, beyond the normal age of retirement, undertook a further revision of the major work (published in 1974) and an intermediate adaptation (the <span class="italic">Oxford Student's Dictionary</span>, 1978).<br>
<br>Hornby seems to have been unaware of, or even to have played down, the part played by sheer professionalism in his remarkable career. Modesty goes some way to explain this, but also discernible is a quintessentially English suspicion of the expert, and of theory divorced from practice. Hornby saw himself as &#145;a simple teacher&#146;, yet this limiting description is belied by his linguistic scholarship (the <span class="italic">Report on Collocations</span> is masterly in its overall plan and detailed structuring); his firm and enthusiastic commitment to applied research; and his pioneering editorship of <span class="italic">English Language Teaching</span>, one result of which was to bring to a readership of practising teachers the developing alliance between linguists and language-teaching professionals. As it happens, these various achievements all bear witness to his particular strength, an extraordinary ability to link theory and practice, and to bring each of his skills as lexicographer, grammarian, and teacher &#145;to bear succinctly and illuminatingly on the others&#146;  (Quirk, 1974).<br>
<br>Hornby's influence on English language teaching has been further extended through the work of the A. S. Hornby Educational Trust, which he himself set up in 1961. This was a far-sighted and generous initiative whereby a substantial part of his income from royalties was set aside to improve the teaching and learning of English as a foreign language, chiefly by providing grants to enable teachers of English from overseas to come to Britain for advanced professional training. Thanks to the trust, hundreds of teachers have been able to develop their teaching expertise through British Council summer schools and postgraduate courses in linguistics and English as a foreign language at British universities.<br>
<br>Hornby's pre-eminence in the field of learner lexicography and language teaching methodology was recognized towards the end of his life by the award of several honours. He was appointed OBE (1964) and made a fellow of University College, London (1975), and a master of arts of the University of Oxford. Shortly before his death from cancer on 13 September 1978, at the University College Hospital, the volume <span class="italic">In Honour of A. S. Hornby</span>, edited by Peter Strevens and with contributions by many of his friends and former colleagues, was presented to him to mark his eightieth birthday.<br>
