<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1588), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, is of obscure origins. Having graduated BA at Peterhouse, Cambridge, early in 1548 and proceeded MA in 1551, he was a fellow of Peterhouse from 1550 to 1555. His activities during the Marian years are unknown. Following Elizabeth's accession he became a preacher in Ipswich, his sermons winning a reputation for him throughout Suffolk. He was appointed one of the twelve university preachers in 1562, served as proctor for the Suffolk clergy in the convocation of 1563, and in 1564 was made a parish chaplain of St Peter's, Norwich. He was granted the degree of BTh in 1562 and became DTh in 1568. He voted with the reformers in convocation in February 1563 in favour of altering or abolishing some of the rites and ceremonies of the church, notably making the sign of the cross in baptism and kneeling at communion.<br>
<br>Walker's abilities and reputation brought him preferment. He became rector of Little Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire, in 1567 but was deprived, probably for non-residency, on 15 August 1570. He was also rector of Alderton, Suffolk, from 1568 to 1571; but appears to have been most active in Norwich where his sermons continued to be much admired. Presented by the lord keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon, to the third prebend in Norwich Cathedral on 25 January 1570, his appointment, together with that of Edmund Chapman, Robert Johnson, and Jeffrey Johnson, helped to bring the reformers within the cathedral chapter into a majority. This position of strength, combined with a distaste for the unreformed nature of the cathedral services, appears to have goaded Walker and others into action. Precisely what happened is unclear, but a hostile report sent to the queen complained of innovations attempted and specifically that four of the prebendaries (Walker, George Gardiner, Thomas Fowle, and Chapman) with others had broken up the organs and committed &#145;other outrages&#146;. Elizabeth sent a stinging letter on 25 September 1570 to the bishop of Norwich, John Parkhurst, insisting that the offenders be discovered and sent to Archbishop Parker for punishment. It seems doubtful that any disciplinary action was actually taken, for on 10 October 1570 the queen conveyed her continuing anger, through a letter from Leicester to Parker, that the matter had been &#145;so far excused&#146; by him. It was grudgingly accepted that the prebendaries were seeking to rid the cathedral of &#145;popish ceremonies&#146;, but their claim that they acted with the dean's consent was disputed  (<span class="italic">Pepys MSS</span>, 174&#150;6).<br>
<br>The Norwich affair brought no loss for Walker: he was collated to the archdeaconry of Essex on 10 July 1571 by Edwin Sandys, bishop of London. He did not hasten to take up his new appointment as he was still in Norwich in August, giving advice on the dispute between the city's governors and the ministers of the Dutch church, and in 1572 his name was included in a proposed ecclesiastical commission for the diocese which never seems to have materialized. He seldom adjudicated on cases in court, remaining active instead as an itinerant preacher. His preface to Robert Norton's translation of Rodolph Gualter's sermons entitled <span class="italic">Certaine godlie homelies or sermons upon the prophets Abdias and Jonas: conteyning a most fruitefull exposition of the same</span> (1573) was dedicated to William Blennerhasset of Norfolk and sheds light on the godly circles with which Walker associated in Norfolk and Suffolk. Further preferment followed his appointment as archdeacon. He became rector of the parish of Laindon, Essex, on 12 November 1573, and of St Botolph, Billingsgate, in 1574. He resigned his prebend in Norwich when collated prebendary of Mora in St Paul's Cathedral on 14 August 1575, and the archdeaconry about August 1585; but he held his other livings until his death in 1588.<br>
<br>Although Walker's life is ill-documented, his career mirrors that of other protestants of his generation&#151;those early evangelicals who urged further reform in Elizabeth's early years but were prepared as time passed to live with the anomalies of the Elizabethan settlement. Once ensconced within the London diocesan hierarchy Walker made himself useful both to Sandys and to his successor John Aylmer. In October 1573 it was reported (possibly wrongly) that Edward Dering's lecture in St Paul's Cathedral &#145;is bestowed uppon Mr Dr Walker&#146;  (Smith, 1.90). In 1578 with the plague spreading, he was named with others to appoint from the London clergy sixty visitors of the sick. He was actively involved in the disciplinary proceedings against Robert, third Lord Rich, and his puritan chaplains in 1581, and on 27 September that year assisted William Charke in a fourth day of conference with Edmund Campion in the Tower. Aylmer employed him on a team to collect material to answer Campion's <span class="italic">Decem rationes</span> and he was appointed in 1582 to confer with captured Catholic priests. He appears to have been most active in the chapter of St Paul's, whether estimating the costs of Sir Nicholas Bacon's funeral or preaching at Aylmer's visitation of the cathedral in 1583, and he worked closely with Dean Alexander Nowell and fellow prebendaries like John Mullins, archdeacon of London. On 8 May 1583 he witnessed Archbishop Grindal's will.<br>
<br>Walker drew up his own will on 14 September 1588, as &#145;residentiary&#146; of St Paul's. He requested burial among other Christians &#145;in simple manner without any pompe or vanitie&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/72, fol. 429<i>v</i>). His &#145;faithfull and lovinge&#146; wife, Anne (probably <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thackham), pregnant at the time, was made his sole executor. She became his widow within the week as the will was granted probate on 21 September 1588.<br>
