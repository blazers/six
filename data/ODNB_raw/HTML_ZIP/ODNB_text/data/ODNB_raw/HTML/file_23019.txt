<span class="headword">Raimbach,  Abraham</span>  (1776&#150;1843), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Cecil Court, St Martin's Lane, London, on 16 February 1776 and baptized on 28 March 1776 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster. His father, (John) Peter Raimbach, was a native of Switzerland, who went when a child to England, and married Martha Butler, a daughter of a Warwickshire farmer. Raimbach was educated at Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School, London, and in 1789 was articled to John Hall (1739&#150;97), historical engraver to the king; in the following year he executed his first independent work, the key to Bartolozzi's plate of the <span class="italic">Death of Chatham</span> after J. S. Copley. On the expiration of his articles, Raimbach entered the Royal Academy Schools, and in 1799 gained a silver medal for a drawing from life. He studied at the academy for nine years, maintaining himself by engraving small plates for G. Cooke's editions of the poets and novelists, after R. H. Corbould, J. H. Thurston, and others; he also painted portraits in miniature which he exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1797 to 1805. In 1801 Raimbach executed three plates, after R. Smirke, for the Revd E. Forster's edition of <span class="italic">The Arabian Nights</span>. With the money thus earned he visited Paris in 1802 and stayed two months, studying in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre. After his return he joined an Artists' volunteer corps in 1803; was a member of the Society of Engravers, 1804; and engraved the illustrations by Smirke for a new edition of Johnson's <span class="italic">Rasselas</span> (1805), doing similar work for J. Sharpe, Longman, and other publishers. In 1805 he married Juliet Harriet and went to live at 9 Warren Street, Fitzroy Square, London, where he remained until 1831, when he moved to Park Terrace, Greenwich. He engraved on steel plate for the Bank of England in 1811, and in 1819 he supported Jacob Perkins's siderographic process for the bank's competition to combat forgery.<br>
<br>In 1812 Sir David Wilkie proposed to Raimbach that they should undertake the publication of a series of large plates, and the scheme was arranged on terms very favourable to Raimbach. The first result was <span class="italic">The Village Politicians</span> (1814), a proof of which was exhibited at the Paris Salon and awarded a gold medal. This was followed by five others, upon all of which Raimbach's reputation mainly rests; these are excellent reproductions of the original pictures, the mode of execution being well suited to the subjects; they are entirely by his own hand, no assistants having been employed on them.<br>
<br>In 1824 and 1825 Raimbach paid further visits to Paris, where he was well received by the leading French engravers; in 1835 he was elected a corresponding member of the Institut de France and in 1836 signed the petition supporting the work of the House of Commons select committee on arts. After Wilkie's death in 1841 the six plates which were the joint property of himself and Raimbach were sold with the stock of prints at Christies. Most of his plates were in line and on copper, usually signed &#145;A. Raimbach&#146;.<br>
<br>Raimbach died at his home in Park Terrace, Greenwich, Kent, of water on the chest, on 17 January 1843, and was buried beside his parents at Hendon, Middlesex, where a mural tablet to his memory was placed in St Mary's Church. His plates and so on were sold by auction on 15 March 1843. His <span class="italic">Memoirs and Recollections</span>, written in 1836, was privately printed in 1843 by his eldest son, Michael Thomson Scott Raimbach (<i>bap</i>. 26 July 1809), who at his death in 1887 bequeathed to the National Portrait Gallery, London, an excellent portrait of his father, painted by Wilkie. His second son, David Wilkie Raimbach (1820&#150;1895), a godson of the painter, exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy from 1843 to 1855; he was for twenty years headmaster of the Birmingham School of Art, and, until within a few weeks of his death, an examiner for the Department of Science and Art. He died on 20 February 1895. There was a third son, Thomas Emmerson (<i>bap</i>. 9 July 1823), and daughters Eliza (<i>bap</i>. 10 Nov 1813), Julia Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 26 July 1809, <i>d</i>. 1816), and Emma Harriet (1810&#150;<i>c</i>.1882) who exhibited miniatures at the Royal Academy between 1835 and 1855, and went into a French convent at Caen, where she died.<br>
