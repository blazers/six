<span class="headword">Walker,  Robert</span>  (1595<span class="mult">x</span>1610&#150;1658), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was by 1637 an independent master, and in 1650 he became a member of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company. &#145;He lived in Oliver Cromwell's days, and drew the portraits of that Usurper, and all his Officers&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 2.142). There is no firm evidence that he either trained in Italy, as has been suggested, or that he worked as an assistant in the studio of Van Dyck, but his portraiture is much influenced by that master. Walker's poses are often stiff and his colour schemes limited compared to Van Dyck's. A prolific artist, his style is much more obviously derivative than that of his royalist counterpart William Dobson. This is evident in, for example, his portrait of Cromwell in the Cromwell Museum, Huntingdon, in which the pose is closely based on that used by Van Dyck in his portrait of Sir Kenelm Digby in armour (NPG). Though his work lacks any of the painterly qualities of Dobson, Walker occasionally demonstrated wit and originality, and his portraits possess a distinctive soft quality that is his own. His portraits were much popularized by the engravings of William Faithorne, and many images (including those of the parliamentarians John Lambert and Thomas Fairfax) are known only through engravings after lost originals. Walker also had a reputation for copying works by Italian masters. Signed and dated portraits by Walker are few. His best-known paintings are his striking <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, which is signed and datable to <i>c</i>.1640&#150;45; <span class="italic">John Evelyn</span>, a portrait of the diarist contemplating a skull, a <i>memento mori</i> (1648; on loan to the NPG); <span class="italic">Oliver Cromwell with his Page</span> (versions at Althorp, Northamptonshire; NPG; Justitsministieriet, Copenhagen, in 1935; and, best known, signed version at Leeds City Art Gallery); and <span class="italic">Colonel John Hutchinson and his Son</span> (priv. coll.).<br>
<br>Walker's <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> in the Ashmolean Museum is closely related to Van Dyck's famous <span class="italic">Self-Portrait with a Sunflower</span> (priv. coll.). The pose is similar but Walker alters the format to give a more vertical emphasis to the composition and points not to a sunflower, which symbolizes loyalty to the crown, but to a statue of Mercury, god of eloquence and feats of skill and patron of vagabonds. While Van Dyck shows himself as confident, at the height of his powers (and wealth), a sophisticated figure drawing attention to his gold chain, Walker reveals his own youth and na&iuml;vety, his serious expression hiding the sardonic wit of his tribute to Van Dyck. A later, more conventional self-portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery, London. <span class="italic">John Evelyn</span> is one of his most accomplished and Italianate portraits. Evelyn is shown in a half-length view wearing a white shirt and blue gown, at a table and leaning on a skull.<br>
<br>Having recently become engaged to be married, Evelyn had sat to Walker on 1 July 1648, an event he recorded in his diary, and the painting was intended to accompany a treatise he had written for his young wife as a guide to married life: <span class="italic">Instruction &#339;conomique</span>. Originally the portrait showed Evelyn holding a miniature or medal of his wife; the skull was added later. It is the image of <span class="italic">Oliver Cromwell with his Page</span> with which Walker is most associated. The finest version of this work, dated 1649, at Leeds, shows the protector in a three-quarter length view, standing, wearing armour and holding a baton, with a page. The pose is related to Van Dyck's <span class="italic">The First Earl of Strafford</span> (studio versions at NPG and Petworth House, Sussex). The several versions of this portrait which Walker continued to produce until 1656 are based on a number of sittings by Cromwell in 1649. Other accomplished portraits such as his <span class="italic">A Portrait of a Tutor and his Pupil</span> (London art market, 1994) (formerly incorrectly called <span class="italic">Lord Fairfax and his Daughter</span>), with its Greek inscription on the bookshelf which translates as &#145;Ever growing older and learning less&#146;, again reveal Walker's wit. His portrait of a man of the Shirley family, signed and dated 1656, shows signs of a fading talent.<br>
<br>Walker, who chiefly painted the portraits of the great parliamentarians of the period, died between July and December 1658, two years before the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. His estate passed to his daughter, Jane Walker; his sister, Katherine, and a servant, Mary Nicholson, also received bequests.<br>
