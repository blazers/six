<span class="headword">Kennedy,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1408&#150;1465), <span class="occ">bishop of St Andrews</span>, was the third son of a much married mother, Mary Stewart (<i>d</i>. after 1458), daughter of Robert III, and her second husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54245/', "Sir James Kennedy")</script> of Dunure (killed 8 November 1408) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54242/', "Kennedy family (per. c.1350&#150;1513)")</script>]. Mary Stewart's various marriages&#151;first to George Douglas, earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1403), and, after Kennedy, to Sir William Graham of Montrose, and finally to Sir William Edmonstone of Duntreath&#151;meant that, from birth, her sons might expect influential support and rapid advancement. In spite of occasional political reverses, James Kennedy emerged to become an important figure, as ecclesiastical statesman, diplomat, and royal adviser, in the reign of James II and the minority of his son. Being the third son, Kennedy seems to have opted for an ecclesiastical career at an early stage. He entered the University of St Andrews about 1426, supported financially by Bishop John Cameron of Glasgow and by his uncle James I. He duly took his master's degree in 1429 and was holding academic office at St Andrews the following year.<br>
<br>A temporary setback then occurred. In the summer of 1431 the king suddenly arrested Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas, and Sir John Kennedy, James's eldest brother. This royal intervention may have been a drastic solution to a Kennedy family feud in Carrick; and it has recently been suggested that James and his other brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54244/', "Gilbert Kennedy")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54242/', "Kennedy family (per. c.1350&#150;1513)")</script>], with no desire to share Sir John's fate&#151;incarceration in Stirling Castle followed by escape into exile&#151;may have assisted the king in undermining John's position. Alternatively, a combination of prudence and fear may have led James to go abroad at this point to the new University of Louvain, where he matriculated in the faculty of law and graduated as bachelor of canon law some time before the end of January 1433. Returning to Scotland, he found himself again in favour, being provided anew to the subdeanery of Glasgow in the spring of 1433. Late in January 1437, when he was aged about twenty-nine, his career appeared at last to have &#145;taken off&#146;: against the wishes of Pope Eugenius IV, the cathedral chapter at Dunkeld, and Walter Stewart, earl of Atholl (<i>d</i>. 1437), James I provided his nephew James Kennedy to the bishopric of Dunkeld.<br>
<br>Almost at once (21 February 1437) James I was assassinated at the instigation of his uncle Atholl, and Kennedy was faced with the problems of gaining acceptance from an initially hostile pope and coping with the political perils associated with a royal minority&#151;for James II, in the care of the widowed queen Joan Beaufort, was only six in 1437. Astutely, the new bishop of Dunkeld threw his support behind Pope Eugenius in his struggle with the Basel conciliarists, a crucial move. By 1439 Kennedy had transformed himself into the leader of the papalist party in Scotland, receiving from a grateful pontiff first the commend of the abbey of Scone (23 September 1439) and then the richest prize of all, the bishopric of St Andrews, following the death of Bishop Henry Wardlaw in 1440. The translation was made on 1 June. Significantly, Kennedy's standing with the pope was such that he was allowed to remit only half the 3300 gold florins in common services payable on entry to St Andrews.<br>
<br>Close association with the queen mother and the rump of James I's administration brought dangers for Kennedy at home, and the bishop found himself on the wrong side in the civil war of 1444&#150;5 which culminated in the collapse of the late king's party, the death of Joan Beaufort, and the dominance of the Douglas&#150;Livingston faction at court. The victors seem to have considered depriving Kennedy of his bishopric; his lands were harried by the earl of Crawford (an incident which led to Kennedy's cursing of Crawford, who died in the &#145;battle of Arbroath&#146; a year later) and he played no further part in government for four and a half years.<br>
<br>Kennedy re-emerged in the parliament of January 1450, supporting the adult James II in condemning his former keepers, the Livingstons, and lending the king money. Thereafter he went on pilgrimage to Rome to attend the jubilee celebrations, and cannot certainly be found in Scotland between 28 August 1450 and 18 April 1452. Thus he was absent when James II launched the first of his assaults on the Black Douglases, and probably returned to Scotland only after the killing of the eighth earl of Douglas, by James II himself, on 22 February 1452. Kennedy's role as royal counsellor was not therefore a dominant one&#151;Bishop William Turnbull of Glasgow was much more active on the royal side during the 1452 crisis&#151;but he performed the signal service of making St Andrews Castle available to Queen Mary of Gueldres during her third pregnancy, which ended successfully in the birth of a male heir, the future James III (May 1452). For the remaining eight years of James II's life Kennedy was a frequent witness to royal charters, an occasional parliamentarian (1452 and 1454), and an auditor of exchequer in 1452, 1455, and 1456. Yet he appears to have played no part in the king's final defeat of the Black Douglases in 1455, and he was never given a major office of state. On embassy to Bourges to take part in Scoto-Danish negotiations in the summer of 1460 he fell ill at Bruges; at about the same time (3 August 1460) James II was killed at the siege of Roxburgh, aged only twenty-nine.<br>
<br>Kennedy's role in government during the early years of James III's minority was limited; he seems not to have returned to Scotland until after the first parliament of the new reign (February 1461), in which Mary of Gueldres effectively took charge of government. A running battle between the queen mother and the bishop ensued, with the latter attempting to honour his earlier promise to Charles VII of France to pursue a Franco-Lancastrian foreign policy, while Mary of Gueldres, perhaps more realistically, followed a more pragmatic line, balancing Lancaster against York in the English civil wars, and recognizing that the Yorkists were the clear victors by the early 1460s. The death of Mary of Gueldres on 1 December 1463, however, left Kennedy, for the last eighteen months of his life, in charge of the young James III. He took the king on an extended northern progress in the summer of 1464; and before he died, at St Andrews on 24 May 1465, the bishop entrusted the custody of the king to Gilbert Kennedy.<br>
<br>Sixteenth-century writers, starting with John Mair (1521), would exaggerate Kennedy's role as James II's principal adviser in his struggle with the Douglases, largely because the theme of the over-mighty subject, not to mention the wilful queen mother, was one which struck a resonant chord in the troubled minority of James V. Later historians, above all A. I. Dunlop in a biographical work of massive scholarship published in 1950, would echo and develop these claims. Yet it is arguable that the true legacy of Bishop Kennedy did not lie in politics. On 27 August 1450 he founded the college of St Salvator at St Andrews, with the particular intention that it should promote the study of theology in the university. The college was liberally endowed&#151;its provost and twelve scholars were to be supported from the teinds (tithes) of four neighbouring parishes&#151;and was soon attracting members of noble Scottish families, studying at their own expense. Mair, followed by Leslie, Pitscottie, and Buchanan later in the sixteenth century, would remember this as one of Kennedy's three remarkable achievements, along with the erection in 1458 of a magnificent tomb in the chapel of his college and the possession of a huge ship, the <i>Salvator</i>, of 500 tons, greatly admired by the water bailiff of Sluys as she rode at anchor in the harbour in 1457.<br>
