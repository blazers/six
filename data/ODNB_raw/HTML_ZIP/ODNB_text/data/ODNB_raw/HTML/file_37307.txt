<span class="headword">Condy,  Henry Bollmann</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1826, <em>d.</em> 1907), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born at Sloane Street, London, and was baptized on 20 August 1826 at St Luke's, Chelsea, the son of George Thomas Condy, barrister and newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Charlotte, the daughter of Colonel Foot of the Scots Greys. He was educated at Brompton Grammar School and later at the Royal College of Chemistry at Oxford Street, London.<br>
<br>In 1843 his mother inherited from Dr Bollman, a Hungarian chemist, the chemical manufactory of C. Foot &amp; Co. which had been founded at Battersea in 1816. Mrs Condy maintained the business until her son's education was complete, whereupon he took over. The chief products were acetic acid, acetate salts, mineral acids, albumen, pharmaceuticals, and other chemicals. Condy eliminated unprofitable product lines and made significant improvements to production methods, for which he took out fifteen patents over the period from 1852 to 1888. On 19 October 1850 Condy married Eleanor Chrisse at St Dunstan-in-the-East, London. They had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Condy's interest in hygiene and disinfection was evident in sales of &#145;ozone water&#146;, in his patents dealing with the preparation and use of chlorine and of highly oxidized compounds of manganese, and in his authorship of five short books on the topic between 1860 and 1867. It was because of this interest that he was awarded a Red Cross medal for services rendered to the sick and wounded during the Franco-Prussian War. Solutions of sodium manganate and permanganate, patented in 1856 and 1876, were marketed as &#145;Condy's fluid&#146;, and the derived solid as &#145;Condy's crystals&#146;. These were widely used as disinfectants and the crystals in particular for treatment of snakebite after Dr Lacerda recommended potassium permanganate for this purpose in 1881.<br>
<br>Imitators who marketed potassium permanganate as &#145;Condy's crystals&#146; (and solutions of it as his fluid) were the subject of litigation which reached its height in Australia at the turn of the century. Although successful, it failed to change the popular belief that Condy's crystals are potassium permanganate. Other litigation between Condy and A. D. Mitchell, who had joined the firm in 1870, led at first to estrangement and then to reconstitution of the company as Condy and Mitchell Ltd, with Mitchell and Condy's eldest son, H. J. Bollmann Condy, as managing directors. From this point the elder Condy gradually withdrew from the business while continuing his interests in industrial chemistry, foreign travel, and horse-riding. He died at his home, 4 The Leas, Folkestone, on 24 September 1907.<br>
