<span class="headword">Pett,  Peter</span>  (<em>b. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> in or before 1672), <span class="occ">naval administrator</span>, was born at Woolwich on 6 August 1610, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22060/', "Phineas Pett (1570&#150;1647)")</script> and Anne Nicholls (<i>d</i>. 1627). He was brought up by his father as a shipwright, while still very young was his father's assistant at Deptford and Woolwich, and in 1635&#150;7 built the <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i> under his father's supervision. On 8 September 1633 he married Katharine Cole of Woodbridge (<i>d</i>. 1651); they had seven sons and four daughters. In 1647 parliament ordered him a gratuity of &pound;10 for building the <i>Phoenix</i> at Woolwich. He was then appointed master-shipwright at Chatham, and in 1648 he both warned parliament of the threat to the ships at Chatham from the royalist revolt in Kent, and subsequently repossessed the ships when the revolt began to collapse. In the same year he became the resident commissioner of the navy at Chatham. Pett excited a strong feeling of animosity by filling all the more important posts in the yard with his near relatives. As early as November 1651 complaints were laid by some of the subordinate officials, including the chaplain, William Adderley, that members of the family worked into each other's hands, that stores were wasted or misappropriated, that higher wages were charged than were paid, and that false musters were kept. A special inquiry was ordered in the following January, when Pett had little difficulty in proving that the charges were malicious; but it is clear that there were great opportunities for fraud and reasonable grounds for suspicion and Pett's running battle with Adderley continued intermittently throughout the 1650s. The commissioner's cousin, Joseph Pett, was master shipwright at Chatham; another cousin, Peter Pett, was master shipwright at Deptford; a younger brother, Christopher, assistant master shipwright at Woolwich; another brother, Phineas, clerk of the check at Chatham, and a cousin, Richard Holborne, master mast-maker. When, in the following summer, his cousin Peter at Deptford died, he was able to have his brother Christopher promoted to the vacancy, and Peter's son Phineas appointed assistant. Pett was also permitted to undertake private contracts for building ships of war.<br>
<br>Pett had, following his first wife's death in July 1651, married Mary Smith (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1664) daughter of the serjeant-at-arms to Charles I. In 1665 he married his third wife, Elizabeth Hatton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pitt, widow of Sir Henry Hatton. Pett served as MP for Rochester in Richard Cromwell's parliament in 1659 and the convention in 1660. Due, in part, to the urging of his brother Phineas, he was won over to support the Restoration and retained his office as a result. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1662. He remained commissioner at Chatham until 29 September 1667, when he was charged with being the main cause of the disaster there in June, when the Dutch had attacked the English fleet, and was summarily superseded. He was accused, in detail, of having neglected or disobeyed orders from the duke of York, the duke of Albemarle, and the navy commissioners to moor the <i>Royal Charles</i> in a place of safety, to block the channel of the Medway by sinking a vessel inside the chain, to provide boats for the defence of the river, and to see that the officers and seamen were on board their ships. On 18 June he was sent a prisoner to the Tower, on the 19th was examined before the council, and on 22 October before the House of Commons. Impeachment proceedings began in November, but when parliament adjourned for two months the matter was dropped. The accusation was merely the outcome of a desire to make him answerable for the failings of those in high places, and Pett was also vulnerable because of his republican past and alleged links to nonconformity. The general feeling was clearly put by Marvell, in the lines:<blockquote>
<div>All our misfortunes upon Pett must fall<br>
</div>
<div>His name alone seems fit to answer all.<br>
</div>
<div>Pett, the sea-architect, in making ships<br>
</div>
<div>Was the first cause of all these naval slips.<br>
</div> (A. Marvell, <span class="italic">The Last Instructions to a Painter</span>; Lord, 1.131&#150;2)</blockquote>Pett's convenience as a scapegoat was enhanced by the realization that the commissioner's nepotism and corruption had seriously damaged the efficiency of Chatham yard: Pepys's papers of the 1660s are full of references to Pett's &#145;hypocrisy&#146;, &#145;false dealing&#146; and &#145;villainy&#146;, and to his being &#145;as very a knave as lives upon earth &hellip; a false-hearted fellow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Samuel Pepys and the Second Dutch War</span>, 18, 19, 21, 383). Pett lived in obscure retirement after his dismissal until his death; his will was proved on 2 December 1672, at which time he was lord of two manors in Suffolk. None of Pett's sons pursued significant careers in the navy, despite the fact that the two eldest were bequeathed their father's ship models in his will. However, many other members of the extended Pett family did serve in the navy throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, leading to long-standing confusion between an abundance of naval Peter and Phineas Petts.<br>
