<span class="headword">Pillans,  James</span>  (1778&#150;1864), <span class="occ">classicist and educational reformer</span>, was born in April 1778 in Riddle's Close, Edinburgh. At the time of his birth his father had recently started his own printing business, which was to remain in the Pillans family into the twentieth century. Pillans's father, James Pillans (1745&#150;1831), was a man of decided and radical political beliefs, and an elder in the Anti-Burgher Secession church of Adam Gib, taking a great interest in the events of the French Revolution until he became disillusioned with the excesses of the terror and with the movement's atheism. All that is known of Pillans's mother is that she persuaded her husband to cease his membership of a reform society in Edinburgh, fearing for the safety and livelihood of her family  (Richardson, 5&#150;6). Although the younger James Pillans did not stay in the Secession church, he was to remain a lifelong whig and friend of prominent whigs such as Jeffrey, Cockburn, and Brougham. Pillans's whig affiliations, and his friendships, were unpopular in tory Edinburgh and lay at the root of the few failures in an otherwise uneventfully successful academic career.<br>
<br>Pillans was sent first to elementary school in Old Town, Edinburgh, and then to the Edinburgh high school where the rector, Alexander Adam, became his mentor and friend. He showed a great aptitude for classical studies and came second in his class on the final examination (his good friend Francis Horner came first). His father expected him to enter the printing trade and proposed to apprentice him to a paper stainer, but he showed no inclination for a business career and in due course the family business passed to Pillans's brothers Hugh and John. Around 1792 he entered Edinburgh University, where he was a pupil of Alexander Dalzel (professor of Greek), studied mathematics under Playfair, and was influenced by Professor Dugald Stewart. He received his MA on 30 January 1801, and may have considered a career in the church. Between 1801 and 1809 he was employed as a private tutor: first to Thomas Francis Kennedy in Ayrshire, next to a family in Northumberland, where he learned to speak French from the family's governess, and finally as a private tutor at Eton College. In later life he wrote that the life of a private tutor was unsuited to anyone who held &#145;decided opinions upon every trifle&#146;, and that the tutor's freedom lay in self-control, for &#145;what can be truer independence than constant self-possession?&#146;  (J. Pillans, <span class="italic">Educational Papers</span>, 1862, 51). These character traits were to prove essential to him in later life. He enjoyed a very happy interval as a private tutor at Eton, where he had leisure for his own studies, made many friends, and had the opportunity of observing methods of teaching and discipline at a great English public school.<br>
<br>In 1804 Pillans's friend Francis Horner recommended him to Francis Jeffrey, the editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, as a potential contributor. At least three articles by him were published, including a review (1808) of the translation of Juvenal by Byron's friend Francis Hodgson. In what was probably a jibe at the whig contributors to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, Byron included Pillans in his satirical poem &#145;English bards and Scotch reviewers&#146; (1809): &#145;And paltry Pillans shall traduce a friend&#146;. The cruel taunt was acknowledged to be without foundation, but it hurt Pillans deeply and caused him lifelong embarrassment. He is said to have complained to Byron, who apologized but never retracted the line  (<span class="italic">A Printing House</span>, 76&#150;7).<br>
<br>When Alexander Adam died in December 1809 he named Pillans as his possible successor as rector of the Edinburgh high school. At first he seemed an improbable candidate, as his politics offended the tory town council and he himself was unsure whether he wanted a career as a public school teacher. The school's boys were recruited to the tory campaign and chants of &#145;No Fraser, No Pillans&#146; were heard (Luke Fraser was interim head after Adam's death and Pillans's own rival for the post of rector). But his candidacy was backed by Robert Blair, the lord president of the court of session, and he was duly elected in January 1810. The new rector encountered serious disciplinary problems when he first faced his class of 144 boys, predisposed to defiance by their role in opposing his election. In his first year he frequently resorted to corporal punishment as a means of keeping order. A pupil in this period remembered an occasion when Pillans beat one of the biggest boys &#145;in spite of his most piteous deprecations&#146;, employing a strong janitor to hold him down  (Steven, 180). Perhaps because of such experiences, Pillans came to reject corporal punishment as degrading to the boy who suffered it and the master who inflicted it alike, and to consider its use evidence of the master's failure to employ effective discipline. After his first year he was able to discontinue the practice altogether, an innovation both by Scottish standards and by those of his preceptors at Eton. In December 1810 he wrote to Francis Horner that he had begun to feel pleasure and enthusiasm in his work. John Brown Patterson, one of his best pupils, found him inspiring, patient, kind, and, perhaps most significantly, never ill-tempered.<br>
<br>For corporal punishment Pillans learned to substitute extra work and verbal setting to rights. His most original contribution to both the education and control of the enormous classes under his care, however, was his application of a version of Bell's and Lancaster's monitorial system to his class at the high school. In his classes the twenty or twenty-five most able boys were chosen as monitors with responsibility for ten boys apiece. Any boy could offer a correction to a monitor's Latin and all disputes were referred to the rector, who kept an eye on the group as a whole. The quicker pupils were encouraged to study quietly while the slower boys received the teacher's full attention. Although he was not the first to employ a variant of the monitorial system for teaching the classics, his use of it in the well-known high school excited great interest in educational circles. Visitors from as far away as America studied and emulated it.<br>
<br>Pillans extended the classical curriculum of the high school, improving the teaching of classical geography, extending the Greek course, and, following his experience at Eton, introducing Latin verse composition, which was not taught in Scottish schools and universities. In 1812 he edited a little volume of these student verses, most of them by boys of fourteen or fifteen, inexperienced in the medium. He was well aware that the work was unpolished compared with that of boys at the English public schools, for whom Latin verse composition was a familiar exercise, and he was later to admit that the work should not have been published at that stage. A favourable notice in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (November 1812) was followed by a hostile review in the rival <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (December 1812) sometimes attributed to the poet laureate, Robert Southey, though other evidence points to Walter Scott as the reviewer. Pillans accepted this criticism with courage and humility, and in future the verse produced by his pupils improved. The <span class="italic">Quarterly Review's</span> criticism did no harm to the high school, which flourished under Pillans, attracting boys from many countries and from all social groups: &#145;I used to sit between a youth of ducal family and the son of a poor cobbler&#146;, as one former pupil put it  (Richardson, 17).<br>
<br>On the basis of his success as rector of the high school Pillans was appointed professor of humanity and laws (Latin) at Edinburgh University in 1820, the electors comprising the lords of session, the Edinburgh town council, and the Society of Writers to the Signet. He held the chair for forty-three years. At some time in the early part of this period he married Helen Thomson, second daughter of the Revd Thomas Thomson, minister of Dailly, Ayrshire. She died over twenty years before her husband and they had no children. Pillans was on close terms with his brothers-in-law, the antiquary Thomas Thomson and the landscape painter John Thomson, and their families.<br>
<br>Pillans found the transition from rector of the high school somewhat difficult. Accustomed to a purely classical curriculum, he was now teaching students whose attention was divided between classics, mathematics, and metaphysics; the older students proved more difficult than schoolboys to mould, and sessions were too short for him to get to know them well. He instituted a version of his monitorial system, using the term &#145;inspectors&#146; for the monitors. He discovered that students were often poorly prepared in Latin and Greek; indeed the standard was often lower than that of his rector's class at the high school. Characteristically, he taught elementary Latin without complaint, reserving his deepest disapproval for those who needed help and refused to ask for it. He opposed the institution by J. S. Blackie of an entrance examination in Greek (1855).<br>
<br>Pillans's scholarship favoured precision and elegance over breadth of knowledge, and he retained a schoolmasterly concern with the classics as an instrument of mental and moral training. An example of this attitude was his distaste for Caesar's <span class="italic">Gallic Wars</span> as a school text; Pillans felt it was lacking in moral lessons and apt to encourage excessive admiration for military skills  (Richardson, 50). He wrote a number of textbooks, including <span class="italic">First Steps in the Physical and Classical Geography of the Ancient World</span> (1853; 13th edn, 1882). His favourite Latin author was Horace; his achievement was to inspire his pupils with an appreciation of Latin literature.<br>
<br>In his lifetime Pillans was immensely respected not only as a professor of classics whose recommendation carried great weight for teaching appointments but also as an authority on education at all levels. He spent his holidays touring parish schools, where he was welcomed by the more confident and fearfully barred from entry by those who knew their work to be sub-standard  (Richardson, 33). On longer holidays he visited France, Switzerland, Prussia, and Ireland, where he made careful observations of the educational systems. In 1834 he gave evidence before the Commons select committee on the state of national education in Britain, chaired by Lord John Russell. Although Pillans believed that a classical education offered a unique training in logic, mental flexibility, hard work, and self-discipline for the governing classes, he believed that it was inappropriate for those destined to follow a trade. He did believe in universal compulsory education (as in Prussia) and was a moderate supporter of secular education programmes, believing they encouraged tolerance and arguing that early religious training properly took place in the home. In 1854 he was president of the Watt Institution, which promoted technical education. His educational addresses, dedicated to Lord John Russell, were published in 1856 as <span class="italic">Contributions to the Cause of Education</span>, and include his claim to have been a pioneer in the use of a blackboard and chalk as a teaching aid.<br>
<br>Pillans was small in physical stature, with an impressive head and an eccentric taste in dress. He wore a white beaver hat and put on a blue coat with brass buttons for important occasions. He was attired in a tartan dressing gown for a photograph taken in 1860, which contemporaries considered a good likeness of him in old age. Refusing to wear spectacles when his sight declined, he used an enormous magnifying glass to read his lectures. His memory for both facts and individuals was excellent, and he always took a helpful interest in the careers of his former pupils. He had a wide circle of friends, including Brougham, Gladstone, and Sir Walter Scott. By nature a friendly, gregarious man, his standards for perfect self-control placed him under an intolerable strain and he endured two episodes of serious mental illness, probably depression. As he grew older he became increasingly fearful of the lonely life that awaited him on relinquishing his chair, despite calls for his retirement. He finally resigned his chair in April 1863, at the age of eighty-five, and received the degree of LLD in the same month. Pillans died at his home, 43 Inverleith Row, Edinburgh, on 27 March 1864, believing he was teaching a class. He was buried on 1 April in the graveyard of St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh.<br>
