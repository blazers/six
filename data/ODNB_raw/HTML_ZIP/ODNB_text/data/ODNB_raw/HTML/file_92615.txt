<span class="headword">Murray,  James</span>, Jacobite first earl of Dunbar  (1690&#150;1770), <span class="occ">politician and governor of the exiled Stuart princes</span>, was the second of the fourteen children of David Murray, fifth Viscount Stormont (<i>d</i>. 1731), and his wife, Marjory (<i>d</i>. 1746), daughter and heiress of David Scott of Scotstarvet, Fife. He was admitted as an advocate at the Scots bar in 1710, when still only twenty years old, but apparently never practised, preferring to pursue a political career.<h2>
<a name="ParliamentandtheFifteen"></a>Parliament and the 'Fifteen</h2>Murray was unsuccessful when he stood as a candidate for Dumfriesshire in the general election of October 1710, but irregularities during the voting meant that he was returned to parliament on petition the following February. As a young MP at Westminster he gave support to the tory ministry of Robert Harley, first earl of Oxford, but was primarily concerned with Scottish affairs, and worked to advance episcopalian interests.<br>
<br>In the general election of November 1713 Murray was returned to parliament as the member for Elgin Burghs. He was then appointed one of the commissaries to carry out further negotiations with France following the recent rejection by parliament of the Anglo-French commercial treaty. This brought him into regular contact with the responsible secretary of state, Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke, to whom he now transferred his political allegiance. On Scottish affairs Murray also worked closely with John Erskine, sixth or twenty-second earl of Mar, one of the other secretaries of state.<br>
<br>It is probable that Murray, whose father was a Jacobite, supported Bolingbroke's wish that the death of Queen Anne should be followed by the accession of her exiled half-brother James Francis Edward, already regarded by Jacobites as James III and VIII. In the event these hopes were dashed. The peaceful accession of George I in August was followed by the dismissal of both Bolingbroke and Mar. Murray returned to Edinburgh, where he failed in January 1715 to persuade the Faculty of Advocates to include in a loyal address sent to George I a clause for the dissolution of the union between England and Scotland.<br>
<br>Although Murray stood again successfully for Elgin Burghs in the general election of March 1715, his election was declared invalid on a petition from the rival candidate, John Campbell (later fourth duke of Argyll), and he was unseated on 7 April. He then crossed to France and joined Lord Bolingbroke, who had recently fled to the Jacobite court in exile at St Germain-en-Laye. Murray became Bolingbroke's secretary, and soon after Bolingbroke was appointed by James III to be the Jacobite secretary of state.<br>
<br>During 1715 Murray was involved with Bolingbroke in planning the Jacobite rising due to take place that summer. The Scottish part would be commanded by the earl of Mar, and at the end of May Murray's sister Marjorie married Mar's brother-in-law and close political associate John Hay (son of the seventh earl of Kinnoull). This marriage not only brought Murray and Mar closer together, but also resulted in a firm friendship and alliance between Murray and Hay.<br>
<br>In September 1715 Murray travelled secretly, via England, to join Mar in Scotland, but was sent back to France in November with the news of the battle of Sherrifmuir. Travelling to Scotland a second time he was captured in Flanders, and imprisoned in Newgate from 16 April to 16 July 1716. It was in March, during his captivity, that Bolingbroke was dismissed as the Jacobite secretary of state and replaced by Mar, who was also given a Jacobite dukedom. Murray now dropped his support for Bolingbroke, and visited the Jacobite court at Avignon, where he aligned himself with Mar. As a result he was appointed to serve as the Jacobite agent in London, where he was to co-ordinate the correspondence between the Stuart court and the Jacobites in England and Scotland.<h2>
<a name="Theroyalmarriage"></a>The royal marriage</h2>Murray remained in England for the next year and a half. He earned the high opinion of both James III and Mar, but the Jacobites who had to deal with him found him both rude and arrogant. His airs of self-importance were deeply resented, and it was noted that he even treated Lord Oxford with disrespect. In March 1718 he was summoned by James III to join the exiled court, which by then had moved to Urbino. He arrived in June, and was immediately sent to Ohlau in Silesia to negotiate the details of the king's proposed marriage to Princess (Maria) Clementina, the youngest daughter of Prince James Sobieski. The very favourable marriage contract that he negotiated was signed at Ohlau on 22 July, after which he returned to Urbino.<br>
<br>Murray was very well received by James III and Mar, and his success seems to have encouraged his ambition as well as his sense of self-importance. He set about trying to replace Mar as the king's chief political confidant, helped by the fact that his brother-in-law Hay had become the king's favourite. The king had decided that no women should be allowed to join the exiled Jacobite court until after his marriage, but Hay had persuaded him to make an exception and allow his wife, Marjorie, to travel out from England, escorted by her brother James. This triumvirate of Murray, Hay, and Marjorie Hay quickly established an ascendancy over the king that began to undermine Mar's position as chief minister.<br>
<br>It was arranged that Clementina would travel to meet and marry the king at Ferrara, and that Murray should return to Ohlau to escort her. But he fell ill, and Hay had to be sent instead. Murray was given the task of going to Ferrara to make everything ready. The plan was that, once the princess and Hay had arrived, and the marriage taken place, the Jacobite court would move to Rome for the winter. Murray set off at the beginning of October, taking with him his sister. In the event the princess was arrested <i>en route</i> at Innsbruck, on the orders of the emperor Charles VI, and the marriage had to be postponed. When Hay was released, he, his wife, and Murray rejoined the king, and accompanied him to Rome.<br>
<br>It was not expected that the court would remain in Rome for very long. In February 1719 James III and Hay travelled to Spain, where a fleet and an army were being assembled to invade England. At the same time Mar resigned as secretary of state and left Rome to travel overland, hoping to be able to rejoin the king in England. In the meantime Murray was entrusted with the entire management of the court, and authorized to conduct negotiations as acting secretary of state.<br>
<br>Murray's peremptory and haughty manner, already commented on in England, was now given free rein. He deeply offended not only the king's household servants but also, more importantly, a group of Scottish exiles, several of whom were peers, who had been living at the court since the rising of 1716. His self-importance increased when Clementina escaped from her imprisonment. She was met by Murray at Bologna, where a proxy marriage service took place on 10 May, with Murray standing in for the king. The new queen was then installed by the pope in a convent in Rome, while news of the planned restoration attempt was awaited from Spain and England.<br>
<br>Murray now monopolized Clementina, not allowing anyone but himself and his sister to gain access to her. By the late summer the members of the court were anxiously awaiting the opportunity to present their grievances to the king, and bring Murray down. It was observed that the queen shared their hostility towards him.<br>
<br>In August 1719, after the failure of the Spanish invasion attempt, James III returned to Italy and himself formally married Clementina at Montefiascone on 1 September, in the presence of Murray, his sister Marjorie, and Hay. The king received a torrent of complaints from his courtiers, including the duke of Mar, but he brushed them all aside, declaring his entire confidence in the way Murray had managed his affairs during his absence. As Mar had been captured and imprisoned in Switzerland, and anyway showed no desire to return, James also confirmed Murray's position as acting secretary of state.<h2>
<a name="Intervalofdisgrace"></a>Interval of disgrace</h2>Murray remained in Rome throughout 1720, and the king continued to receive numerous complaints. James's wish to appoint a new secretary of state eventually brought Murray down. The Jacobites in both France and Great Britain made it clear that they were reluctant to have any dealings with Murray; yet no one else was willing to accept the post so long as he remained at the court. When even Hay joined Mar in advising that Murray would have to be sent away, James III reluctantly agreed, assuring Murray that he himself was still satisfied with him. But the king decided that he would not in the event appoint anyone else, and instead ordered Hay to take over as acting secretary of state.<br>
<br>By this time the queen was pregnant, so Murray asked to be allowed to remain at the court until after the birth of her child. Prince Charles Edward was born on 31 December 1720, and Murray finally left Rome on 6 February. Before he went he sent the king a long apologia, in which he asked to be given a peerage as evidence that he was not in disgrace, and so that he might continue to serve the king elsewhere. James agreed to continue paying him his monthly pension of 200 livres but declined at that moment to give him a peerage.<br>
<br>For the next four and a half years Murray moved between Lorraine, France, and the Spanish Netherlands, mixing in Jacobite circles. He maintained a regular correspondence with his sister and brother-in-law in Rome, and thus with the king, and made no secret of the deep hostility he now felt towards Mar. At one point in 1721 he thought of returning to Scotland, but the king would not give his permission. Eventually, at the beginning of 1724, the king agreed to give him a Scottish peerage as earl of Dunbar, backdated to before his departure from Rome in February 1721, but on condition that it should not yet be publicly declared.<br>
<br>In May 1724 Murray received a letter from his mother asking him to return to Scotland to help settle a family disagreement, and this time the king agreed to let him go. Murray planned to go during the autumn, but changed his mind when he heard in September that his sister, who had gone ahead to help settle her husband's financial affairs, had been arrested at Dover and imprisoned in Newgate. He decided to retire permanently to Lorraine. His elder brother was unmarried and in bad health, so he hoped eventually to inherit the family peerage and then obtain a pass to return.<h2>
<a name="GovernortoPrinceCharles"></a>Governor to Prince Charles</h2>Murray's life and prospects were dramatically changed during 1725. His sister was released from Newgate and returned to Rome in time for the birth in March of Clementina's second child, Prince Henry (the future Cardinal York). To mark the occasion Hay was appointed secretary of state and publicly recognized as earl of Inverness (a peerage originally given him in 1718). Then, in July, Murray himself received a summons to rejoin the court. James III had decided that the upbringing of Prince Charles, though he was only four and a half years old, should be entrusted to men. Since his under-governor and preceptor were to be Catholic, a protestant, Murray, was to be his governor. He reached Rome in September, was publicly acknowledged as earl of Dunbar, and created a knight of the Thistle on Prince Charles's fifth birthday. His new appointment and these honours meant that he could never return to Scotland without a Stuart restoration, so he now resigned himself to a life of exile, further confirmed when his elder brother married, and in 1727 had a son and heir.<br>
<br>As Dunbar grew older he probably became less brusque and high-handed, but his sense of self-importance does not seem to have diminished, and he was thoroughly disliked by most members of the Jacobite court, notably the few other Scots who were there. It was his return to the court in September 1725 that caused Clementina, already exasperated by the influence of Lord and Lady Inverness, to separate from her husband and take refuge in the convent of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. His return also provoked Pope Benedict XIII to take sides with Clementina, which led to James III's decision to remove his court to Bologna from 1726 to 1729.<br>
<br>Dunbar was now reunited with his sister and brother-in-law, and he quickly consolidated his influence over the king. When Lord and Lady Inverness left the court in April 1727, as an essential condition for the return of Clementina, he stayed on as James III's principal minister, a position he held for the next twenty years. He served as the governor of Prince Charles until the latter achieved his majority in December 1738, after which he remained in attendance as the prince's gentleman-in-waiting. From 1729 until March 1743 he also served as the governor of Prince Henry. It is not true, as is often stated, that he was the tutor to either of the princes, nor that he became secretary of state.<br>
<br>Dunbar's position at court was eased by the death of Clementina in January 1735, but his relations with Prince Charles, which were never good, grew steadily worse. Indeed it is fair to say that the profound hostility the prince felt towards his governor, whom his father continued to trust and employ, contributed to the breakdown in relations between James III and his son, which was to have such a significant impact on the future of the Jacobite movement.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>Nevertheless Dunbar's influence with James III began to wane after 1740, partly because he was considered too anti-French, at a time when the War of the Austrian Succession had revived the possibility of a Franco-Jacobite alliance. When Prince Charles left for France in January 1744, followed by Prince Henry in August 1745, Dunbar had no role at the court, but he remained there until after the defeat of the Jacobite rising in Scotland and the safe return of Prince Charles to France. Then, when the prince failed to get further French support, Dunbar defended his irresponsible behaviour in Paris. This, according to Benedict XIV, made James III lose all confidence in him, and resulted in his retirement. He left Rome in April 1747, at the age of fifty-seven, and went to live with his sister (a widow since 1740) at Avignon. Together they acquired a country house outside the city, which they called Belvedere.<br>
<br>The final twenty-three years of Dunbar's life were relatively uneventful. He and his sister received Prince Charles when he was expelled from France and stayed at Avignon from December 1748 to February 1749. He then irritated both James III and Benedict XIV by continuing to defend the prince's behaviour. In September 1751, having studied some of the writings of Bishop Bossuet, Antoine Arnauld, and Pierre Nicole, he converted to Catholicism at Dijon. His sister, who had already converted in 1731, left him all her property in a will dated August 1756. She died in October 1766. His own will, in which he left everything to his former charge Prince Henry, by then Cardinal York, was dated April 1769.<br>
<br>By the time of his own death at Avignon in August 1770, three and a half years after the death of James III in Rome, Dunbar had lived long enough to see the rest of his family well established in the service of George II and George III. His elder brother David, sixth Viscount Stormont, had died in 1748 and been succeeded as seventh viscount by his son David, who now also inherited Dunbar's Jacobite earldom. But Lord Stormont had a successful diplomatic career, serving the Hanoverian kings, and never assumed the title. Dunbar's younger brother William was appointed lord chief justice of king's bench in 1756 and given a peerage [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19655/', "Murray, William, first earl of Mansfield")</script>].<br>
<br>Dunbar is chiefly remembered today as the man who, having negotiated the marriage between James III and Maria Clementina Sobieska, stood in for the king during their proxy marriage, and was given responsibility for the upbringing and education of their children. But he should also be remembered as the man who, with his sister and brother-in-law, allowed his ambition and vanity to destroy the harmony of the Jacobite court in exile. His behaviour drove some people to leave, and prevented the arrival of others. His determination to dominate the court, and to be the king's chief political confidant, played a major role in creating the barrier between the king and both Clementina and Prince Charles, with such disastrous effects on the prospects of the Jacobite movement in 1725&#150;7 and after 1746.<br>
