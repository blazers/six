<span class="headword">Bott,  Thomas</span>  (1688&#150;1754), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Derby in 1688, the youngest of the six children of a mercer; his grandfather had been a parliamentary major. He was probably the son of Thomas Bott, whose son Thomas was baptized at All Saints', Derby, in June 1688. He was educated for the dissenting ministry, but, after some experience of preaching, he went to London to study medicine, and then took orders in the Church of England, obtaining the rectory of Whinburgh, in Norfolk, through Lord Macclesfield's interest. In 1724 he published a discourse entitled <span class="italic">The Peace and Happiness in this World, the Immediate Design of Christianity</span>. A defence of this, <span class="italic">The Nature and Design of Christianity Further Considered</span>, followed in 1727. In 1725 he attacked William Wollaston's peculiar mode of deducing morality from truth, and in 1730 published a sermon on the question entitled <span class="italic">Morality Founded in the Reason of Things</span>. In 1734 Mr Longe gave him the rectory of Spixworth, which he held, with the neighbouring parish of Croftwick, until his death. On 30 January 1738 he preached a sermon concerning the duty of doing as we would be done by, observing only, by way of application, that if both parties had fulfilled this duty Charles I would not have lost his head. In the same year he attacked Joseph Butler's <span class="italic">Analogy of Religion</span> (1736). He married Rebecca, daughter of Edmund Britiffe of Hunworth, in 1739. In his chief work, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Rev. Mr Warburton's Divine Legation of Moses</span> (1743), he censured Warburton for making morality dependent upon the command of a superior being. He also accused Warburton of confusion in his citation of the non-Christian ancients, thereby rendering much of the latter's work unacceptable. In 1747 he was presented to the living of Edgefield, Norfolk. His whole ecclesiastical income was &pound;200 a year. His health broke in 1750, and he died on 19 September 1754 at Norwich. He was a follower of Bishop Benjamin Hoadly, a friend of Samuel Clarke, and a thorough whig. A son, Edmund, was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.<br>
