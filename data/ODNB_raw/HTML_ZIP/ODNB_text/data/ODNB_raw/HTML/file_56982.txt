<span class="headword">Samuelson,  George Berthold <span class="st"> [Bertie]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1947), <span class="occ">film producer and director</span>, was born on 6 July 1889 at 41 Nevill Street, Southport, the youngest of the five children of Henschel Samuelson, formerly Metzenberg (1829&#150;1889) and his wife, Bertha (1854/5&#150;1918), daughter of Solomon Weile and his wife, Rahle. The Metzenberg family were Jews from Lissa, Prussia. Members emigrated to Ireland and about 1846 changed the family name to Samuelson. Henschel Samuelson, a tobacconist, died seven weeks after Bertie Samuelson's birth, and the children were brought up in Southport by their mother. The three boys of the family who survived infancy all went on to flourishing careers in the arts: Julian Wylie (as he became known) became famous as a producer of pantomimes, Lauri Wylie wrote for the theatre, and Bertie Samuelson rose high in the film trade. He was educated at University School, Southport, but left at the age of fourteen. After several attempts to found a career, he became interested in the emergent film industry, and initially ran a cinema in Southport, before turning to film rental and establishing in 1910 the Royal Film Agency, which he moved to Birmingham at the end of that year.<br>
<br>The business was a success, and provided Samuelson with the capital to realize his idea of a grand feature film on the life of Queen Victoria. In 1913 he approached producer Will Barker to make the film <span class="italic">Sixty Years a Queen</span> at Ealing, which Samuelson financed and distributed. The film, a bold patriotic pageant, was a triumph and made his fortune. It persuaded him to expand into production, which he did in 1914, by purchasing Worton Hall, Isleworth, which he converted into studios, and hiring the skilful George Pearson as director. Their first production, an adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes mystery <span class="italic">A Study in Scarlet</span>, was a noteworthy success, and set the pattern for Samuelson Film Company productions: well-made dramas, generally based on literary properties, with a preference for sentimental scenes from the past.<br>
<br>The war years were Samuelson's finest and saw such productions as <span class="italic">The Great European War</span> (1914), made within days of the declaration of war (a typically bravura action), <span class="italic">John Halifax, Gentleman</span>, <span class="italic">Little Women</span>, <span class="italic">Hindle Wakes</span>, and his probable masterpiece, <span class="italic">Milestones</span>, based on the Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblock play, which employed the kind of multiple-story narrative that he often favoured. Pearson left him after fifteen months, unable to keep up with his ceaseless energy, and subsequent Samuelson productions were directed by Alexander Butler, Fred Paul, and others, including Samuelson himself. A flurry of good productions in 1919 seemed to offer much post-war promise, but the competition of lavish American product, the iniquities of the block-booking system, which held up the release of British films, and the poverty of both budgets and imagination in too many British films spelt doom for Samuelson and his kind. He was more enterprising than most, however, and took a company of British actors and technicians to Hollywood in 1919&#150;20 to make six features that were somewhat too hastily produced. A hoped-for cross-Atlantic exchange agreement with an American production unit never materialized. In 1923 he married Marjorie Vint (1901&#150;1989). Their four sons also went into the film industry.<br>
<br>Samuelson had a fearless approach to film-making, and took on such bold subjects as venereal disease, in his version of Eugene Brieux's <span class="italic">Damaged Goods</span> (1919), and birth control, in <span class="italic">Married Love</span> (1923), with a scenario by Marie Stopes. He also diversified into the coach business, at the time of a threatened rail strike. The Samuelson Transport Company, offering trips to seaside resorts, opened in May 1921 and was immediately swamped by business. Samuelson's coaches rapidly became famous, but the venture was heavily dependent on vehicles purchased on credit, and a public flotation was a failure. The strike did not materialize, the fine summer ended, and Samuelson was left with little but debts. He returned to film-making, but the British film industry was now in a slump. In 1922 he started a new company, British Super Films, which lasted only a few months, then formed Napoleon Films, when he made an ambitious drama about Napoleon, <span class="italic">A Royal Divorce</span> (1923), his last success. Further production floundered in the industry's mid-1920s depression, and a bold move to film Rider Haggard's <span class="italic">She</span> in studios in Berlin became a singularly ill-fated and costly venture that effectively ruined him. He was made personally bankrupt in 1929. Thereafter he could remain only on the fringes of the film industry, directing cheap &#145;quota quickies&#146; during the 1930s. He tried other enterprises, including a circulating library, and eventually took a job as a clerk in the offices of film producers British Lion. During the Second World War he was superintendent of two nitrate film depots outside Birmingham, where his film career had properly begun. In his latter years he was afflicted by diabetes.<br>
<br>In his heyday G. B. Samuelson was an unmistakable figure. He was large in frame, dynamic and unstoppable in his enthusiasm, generous and trusting, a lover of all that the cinema could show, but in the end not hardhearted enough to survive long-term in the tough film business. In the 1910s his films were a beacon for the native film industry; those of the 1920s increasingly suffered from poor judgement and poorer budgets, and he in any case belonged to a more innocent age of film-making.<br>
<br>Samuelson died on 17 April 1947 at Crook House, Crook Lane, Great Barr, Aldridge, Staffordshire. His body was cremated. Sadly, he did not live to see the Samuelsons become virtually the first family of the British film industry. He told his sons, &#145;If you must go into the film industry, be a technician and not a producer&#146;  (Dunham and Samuelson, 394). They followed this sound advice. Sydney Samuelson trained as an editor and cameraman, then as a director of documentaries, before founding Samuelson's Film Service, where he was later joined by brothers David (heading the technical side), Michael (operations), and Anthony (finance). The business grew into the Samuelson group to become the world's largest supplier of audio-visual equipment. Sydney Samuelson, beneficiary of many film industry awards, became CBE in 1978 and was knighted in 1995. Between 1991 and 1998 he was the first British film commissioner. David became a noted news and documentary cameraman and his manuals for film technicians are used the world over. Michael, made a CBE in 1989, became a specialist in sports documentaries. Succeeding generations of Samuelsons also took up work behind and in front of the camera, honouring further a distinguished name.<br>
