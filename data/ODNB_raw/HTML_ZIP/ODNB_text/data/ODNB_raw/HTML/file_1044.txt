<span class="headword">Bagshaw,  Edward</span>  (1629/30&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Independent minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Broughton, Northamptonshire, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1043/', "Edward Bagshaw (d. 1662)")</script>. After education at Westminster School, on 1 May 1646 he was elected to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 1 February 1647, aged seventeen. He graduated BA in 1649 and MA in 1651 (incorporated at Cambridge in 1654). Anthony Wood gives an account of his having been an unruly, intemperate, and provocative undergraduate, showing scant regard for authority or tradition, and of his having &#145;a turbulent and domineering&#146; manner after graduation, addressing the vice-chancellor, John Owen, with his hat on  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.944). Owen seems not to have taken offence, for through his good offices in 1656 Bagshaw was appointed second master at his old school, Westminster, under his old headmaster, Richard Busby. However, Bagshaw's habit of &#145;sitting with my Hat on at Church [i.e. in the abbey]&#146; and his &#145;not overvaluing&#146; Busby's Greek grammar  (Bagshaw, 2) fuelled a quarrel with his superior over duties and responsibilities. Bagshaw was suspended by the governors, and finally expelled in May 1658. The episode prompted his apologetic <span class="italic">A True and Perfect Narrative of the Differences between Mr. Busby and Mr. Bagshawe</span> (1659).<br>
<br>After this disappointment Bagshaw returned to Oxford, &#145;propagating his Commonwealth Principles&#146; according to Walter Pope, his &#145;Schoolfellow and intimate Friend&#146;, who describes Bagshaw as the ringleader of a move to abolish caps and hoods &#145;as Reliques of Popery&#146;  (Pope, 37, 40). On 25 August 1659 Bagshaw was presented to the vicarage of Ambrosden, Oxfordshire; on 3 November, rather surprisingly in the light of his later career, he was ordained by Ralph Brownrigg, bishop of Exeter. By 1661 Bagshaw had withdrawn from the established church and the living was vacant; in that year, too, he was deprived of his Christ Church studentship. In 1661 he became chaplain to Arthur Annesley, first earl of Anglesey, whom he accompanied to Ireland in July 1662. Prohibited from preaching by the archbishop of Dublin, James Margetson, and harassed for holding conventicles in his lodgings, he was released from Anglesey's service and returned to England in September 1662. In October he was reported as saying that &#145;the King only minded his mistresses&#146;, that &#145;popery was coming in&#146;, that London was &#145;much discontented&#146; at the Bartholomew day ejections, that the Long Parliament was not lawfully dissolved, and that people would rather be governed by it than by the restored regime  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1661&#150;2</i>, 531&#150;2). On 30 December a warrant was issued for him to be sent in custody to Secretary Henry Bennet. He was then living at Moreton Pinkney, Northamptonshire, presumably in the paternal home. Imprisoned first in the Gatehouse, Westminster, he was committed to the Tower for &#145;treasonable practices&#146; on 16 January 1663, where, at the end of the month, a search of his room by the surveyor of the press, Roger L'Estrange, uncovered a manuscript in defence of a fellow prisoner named John Davis. This led to an interview with the king, &#145;who examined him of whom he had that Paper&#146;. The boldness of Bagshaw's manner &#145;much offended&#146; the king, &#145;whereupon he was sent back to the Tower, and laid in a deep, dark, dreadful dungeon&#146; on 3 February 1664, whence, three days later, he was removed upon the intervention of his brother, the conformist minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1045/', "Henry Bagshaw")</script>  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.378). On 31 March 1664 a warrant was issued for his removal to Southsea Castle, Hampshire, &#145;an unwholesome place in the Sea by Portsmouth&#146;  (ibid.), where he arrived on 17 April. There his fellow prisoners included Vavasor Powell. In January 1666 it was reported that he refused to sue for pardon, but on 9 November 1667 a warrant was issued for his discharge. In 1669 a man of his name was reported to be preaching at Bicester in Oxfordshire, at Westbury in Buckinghamshire, at Wanlip in Leicestershire, and at Burton Dassett and Priors Marston in Warwickshire. In May 1671 he was sentenced at Middlesex sessions to detention in Newgate during the king's pleasure for refusing to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy. He was still a prisoner, though not confined, when he died on 28 December 1671 at a house in Tuttle (Tothill) Street, Westminster. He was buried in Bunhill Fields; according to Wood, the inscription for his tombstone was composed by John Owen.<br>
<br>The intemperance which marked Bagshaw's encounters with superiors and with institutional authorities was a feature also of his literary career. He was a heated controversialist on behalf of nonconformist principles of an extreme congregational, even separatist, stamp. This brought him into conflict with Richard Baxter. In the tract which provoked the archbishop of Dublin to prohibit his preaching, <span class="italic">A Letter to a Person of Quality</span> (1662), Bagshaw had in fact intervened on Baxter's behalf in a controversy with Baxter's diocesan, George Morley, drawing upon himself the ire of Roger L'Estrange in <span class="italic">A Whipp, a Whipp for the Schismatical Animadverter</span> (1662); nevertheless, Bagshaw had none of Baxter's desire to minimize the nonconformists' separation from the established church nor his hope for eventual comprehension within the Church of England. On the contrary: Baxter's <span class="italic">The Cure of Church Divisions</span> (1670) drew from Bagshaw an <span class="italic">Antidote Against Mr. Baxters palliated Cure of Church Divisions</span> (1670) and, alternating with replies from Baxter, <span class="italic">A Defence of the Antidote</span> (1671) and <span class="italic">A Review and Conclusion of the Antidote</span> (1671), in which Bagshaw mocked what he took to be the inconsistencies of Baxter's &#145;middle way&#146;, rejected the legitimacy of parish churches, and refused to allow that occasional conformity to the episcopal church could be practised with integrity. In the <span class="italic">Review</span>, dated from Newgate 9 June 1671, he accused Baxter of having deserted &#145;the <i>Cause of</i> <i>Christ</i>, and <i>Non-conformity</i>&#146;  (E. Bagshaw, <span class="italic">A Review and Conclusion of the Antidote</span>, 1671, 4).<br>
<br>Theologically, Bagshaw was an extreme Calvinist with (though he denied this) antinomian tendencies and Fifth Monarchist sympathies. In such tracts as <span class="italic">A Practical Discourse Concerning Gods Decrees</span> (1659) and <span class="italic">The Doctrine of Free-Grace</span> (1662) he argued strenuously for double predestination and a limited atonement against the &#145;Arminian&#146; doctrines of free will, conditional election, and universal redemption which he detected in such adversaries as Thomas Pierce. The <span class="italic">Practical Discourse</span> was dedicated to the regicide John Bradshaw, whereby, in the view of an episcopalian commentator, Bagshaw had &#145;unhappily nail'd himself down to a very harsh Doctrine, and to a very odious Patron&#146;  (Kennett, 603). Baxter described him as &#145;an Anabaptist, Fifth Monarchy man, and a Separatist, and a man of an extraordinary vehement spirit, who had been exasperated by many years hard and grievous imprisonment&#146;  (R. Baxter, <span class="italic">Apology for the Nonconformist Ministry</span>, 1681, 162). Though he could not approve that Bagshaw &#145;sided Tooth and Nail with the Fanatics&#146;, Walter Pope acknowledged Bagshaw's &#145;Natural and acquir'd parts&#146;  (Pope, 41). He had &#145;a great Reputation in the University as a Scholar&#146;, says Calamy  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.542), and he managed his controversial prose with pungency and forcefulness. At a date after 1665 Bagshaw had married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1672), the blind second daughter of John Peacock, of Chawley, Cumnor, Berkshire, &#145;who fell in love with him for his preaching&#146;  (Pope, 41). There were no children.<br>
