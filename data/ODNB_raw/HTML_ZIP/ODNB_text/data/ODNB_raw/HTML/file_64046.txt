<span class="headword">Wilmot,  Anthony Talbot de Burgh <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1915&#150;1996), <span class="occ">colonial administrator, businessman, and evangelist</span>, was born on 24 June 1915 at The Mount, Shoreham, Kent, the youngest of five children and third son of Albert de Burgh Wilmot, paper manufacturer, and his wife, (Mary) Dorothea Herbert, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Noyes. He was educated at Tonbridge School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he read English and attended lectures by C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. After graduating with a third-class degree in 1937, he was accepted for appointment to the colonial administrative service in Northern Rhodesia on 31 August that year. After returning to Oxford (where he completed the colonial service probationers' course, and won a hockey blue) he served as assistant district commissioner in Northern Rhodesia between 1938 and 1940, acquiring such fluency in Chibemba that he could be mistaken for a native speaker. As senior cypher officer to the 11th African division in the east Africa campaign during the Second World War he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and was mentioned in dispatches on 30 December 1941. In 1944 he became secretary to the government in British Somaliland. While on home leave, on 1 June 1946, he married Alice Eva (Eve) Stanley-Smith (1922&#150;2006), daughter of Algernon Charles Stanley-Smith, missionary doctor, and granddaughter of Stanley Peregrine Smith, one of the renowned &#145;Cambridge Seven&#146; missionaries to China. They had seven children, including two sets of twins: Jonathan and Miriam (<i>b</i>. 1948), Timothy (<i>b</i>. 1950), Geoffrey (<i>b</i>. 1953), Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1955), and David and Patrick (<i>b</i>. 1959). While the children were at boarding schools Wilmot would write to one of them each day of the week.<br>
<br>In September 1946 Wilmot was transferred to the Gold Coast as an administrative officer. In 1954 he was appointed permanent secretary to the Ministry of Communication and Works, where he saw through such projects as the construction of the Volta Dam and Tema harbour. In 1956 he left the colonial service to join the Commonwealth Development Corporation, and after two years in Singapore, Borneo, and Malaya returned to Africa as west African regional controller, working to encourage business investment in west African countries prior to independence. He subsequently worked in the private sector, as a business consultant and &#145;company doctor&#146;.<br>
<br>From the early 1950s Tony and Eve Wilmot ran a weekly <span class="roman">Bible</span> class in their home. Wilmot had a gift for choosing future influencers in whom to invest. Regular members of his <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes included Yakubu Gowon, later military governor of Nigeria; Jeremiah Gana, later Nigeria's minister for information; Emeka Anyaoku, later secretary-general of the Commonwealth; and Philemon Quaye, later commodore of the Ghanaian navy, and then Ghana's ambassador to Liberia and Egypt. In 1955 Wilmot was commissioned by the British Inter-Varsity Fellowship, a founding member of the fledgeling International Fellowship of Evangelical Students (IFES), to gauge the possibility of pioneering a sister movement in Africa. From that point on Wilmot became the moving spirit behind the foundation of the Pan African Fellowship of Evangelical Students.<br>
<br>Seeing the need for African pastors to be trained in their own context, Wilmot worked to found a theological college for postgraduate study in Africa. He and his wife travelled throughout Europe, America, and Australia to raise the required funding and in 1979 purchased 18 acres in Karen, outside Nairobi, Kenya, for $200,000. The site housed three chicken runs and a dog-food factory. That scene illustrated a profound characteristic of Wilmot: he looked at what was and saw what could be. In 1983 the Nairobi Evangelical Graduate School of Theology was opened with a Zimbabwean dean, four students, and Wilmot as principal. By the time of his death it had trained 200 pastors and theological teachers.<br>
<br>When Wilmot retired to Kent another project loomed. Throughout all his years in Africa he had maintained a close link with the evangelical parish church of St Nicholas, Sevenoaks. The church had grown significantly and needed to find more space. There was no alternative but to dig underneath, a first for a medieval structure and not without risk. The cost was over &pound;2 million, almost all of which had to be raised from within the congregation. Wilmot worked closely with the rector, Miles Thomson, bringing business acumen and wide experience in project management. Together they called the project &#145;building for the gospel&#146; and drove it through to completion in June 1995.<br>
<br>Wilmot died at Farnborough Hospital from heart failure on 14 December 1996 and was buried in Greatness Park cemetery, Sevenoaks. He was survived by his wife, Eve, and their seven children. While he had devoted most of his working life, both in the colonial service and in business, to the political and economic development of Africa, the founding of the evangelical student ministry and of the Nairobi Evangelical Graduate School of Theology formed a major part of his legacy to the church across that continent.<br>
