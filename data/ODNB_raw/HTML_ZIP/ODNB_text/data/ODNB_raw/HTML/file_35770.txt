<span class="headword">Roberts,  Isaac</span>  (1829&#150;1904), <span class="occ">geologist and astronomer</span>, was born on 27 January 1829 at Groes, near Denbigh, north Wales, the son of William Roberts, a farmer. When he was only six the family moved to Liverpool, where his father became a bookkeeper. He received a Sunday school education from the local Welsh Calvinist Methodist church and retained a knowledge of the Welsh language throughout his life. In 1844 he was apprenticed for seven years to the Liverpool builders John Johnson &amp; Son, later Johnson and Robinson. After the death of Robinson in 1855, Roberts was made manager, but with the demise the following year of the surviving partner he wound up the concern. In 1859 Roberts went into business for himself as a builder in Liverpool, and in 1862 he was joined by J. J. Robinson, the son of his former employer. The firm traded for a quarter of a century as Roberts and Robinson, undertaking many large and important contracts in and around Liverpool. These included the construction of the Birkenhead waterworks and the Lime Street Hotel, Liverpool. Roberts married his first wife, Ellen Anne, the daughter of Anthony Cartmel, in 1875.<br>
<br>While still a businessman, Roberts attended the Liverpool Mechanics' Institute, where he began taking a serious interest in geology. He became a fellow of the Geological Society in 1870, and gave his first paper, on the filtration of water through Triassic sandstone, at the British Association meeting of 1878. Between 1882 and 1889 he undertook complex experiments on the influence of air pressure and lunar attractions on the movement of underground water. His findings, published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> for 31 January 1884, embodied the results of these experiments, providing valuable data for the design and building of storehouses.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Roberts's attention was turning to practical astronomy. In 1878 he had erected a 7 inch refracting telescope by Cooke &amp; Sons of York at his fashionable home at Rock Ferry, Birkenhead, which he used for visual observation. A few years later he devoted himself enthusiastically to the rapidly changing discipline of astronomical photography. To find clearer skies, he moved in 1883 to Kennessee, Maghull, near Liverpool, where he started photographing stars, using ordinary portrait cameras with lenses varying in aperture between <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch and 5 inches. Encouraged by the results in comparisons with photographs of the nebula in Orion taken by Andrew Ainslie Common, he decided to acquire a large reflecting telescope with a silver-on-glass mirror. Roberts initially used an 18 inch telescope by Howard Grubb of Dublin, an instrument which was later presented to the Dunsink observatory, near Dublin. He then ordered from Grubb a 20 inch reflector of 100 inches focal length. His 7 inch refractor was used as a guide telescope, being mounted as a counterpoise on the declination axis of the German-type equatorial mounting.<br>
<br>Roberts first presented his astronomical photographs at the January meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1886, when he was president of the Liverpool Astronomical Society. He reported on 200 photographs of stars, along with those of the Orion nebula, the Andromeda galaxy, and the Pleiades star cluster. At the November meeting that year he showed a photograph of the Pleiades, of three hours' exposure, taken with his 20 inch reflector. The stars Alcyone, Maia, Merope, and Electra were seen surrounded by nebulosity, a structure never before seen or suspected.<br>
<br>At the meeting in December 1888 Roberts showed a photograph of the great Andromeda nebula which suggested a spiral structure. It evoked considerable interest as it supported the visual observations of nebulae by the third earl of Rosse in Ireland. Photographs of the Orion nebula, presented a few months later, were equally well received. These successes supported Roberts's claim for the superiority of the reflector over the refracting telescope. During this period Roberts designed an instrument to transfer mechanically the images on a photographic negative to a copper plate. Known as the Pantograva, the device was first made by the firm of Hilger.<br>
<br>Following the work of the Henry brothers at the Paris observatory, Roberts attended a photographic congress at Paris in 1887. The international gathering of astronomers agreed to a photographic survey of the heavens, but Roberts wisely declined an invitation to join the Carte du Ciel project, which was shared between national observatories with uniform instruments. In order to continue his work on the nebulae and star clusters, Roberts was again driven to search for a clearer atmosphere than that of Liverpool, and finally settled in 1890 at Crowborough Hill, Sussex, in a house appropriately named Starfield. He now supervised the work, which was undertaken by W. S. Franks, an astronomer and skilful photographer who became his working assistant. Each month for several years he exhibited splendid photographs at the Royal Astronomical Society, and in 1893 and 1899 he issued two volumes of his photographs of stars, star clusters, and nebulae, 125 reproductions in all.<br>
<br>Following the example of the American Professor Barnard of Lick and later Yerkes Observatory, Roberts undertook in 1896 a programme of wide photography using various portrait lenses in his cameras. He went on to compare these photographic results with those of the reflecting telescope, which resulted in a discussion between Roberts and Barnard on the relative efficiency of the two methods. To resolve the issue Roberts prepared photographs of fifty-two regions of the sky reported by Sir William Herschel to contain nebulae, using his reflector and with a portrait lens of 5 inches aperture made by Cooke &amp; Sons. Roberts's work, which showed no nebulosity for forty-eight of these areas, was published in 1902 by the Royal Astronomical Society. His findings were disputed by Dr Max-Wolf of Heidelberg, who examined some of the evidence. From 1896 Roberts corresponded with Sir Norman Lockyer on evidence for rotation in those spiral nebulae which he photographed.<br>
<br>Roberts joined the Royal Astronomical Society in 1882. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1890, and two years later the honorary degree of DSc was conferred on him by Trinity College, Dublin. The award no doubt reflected his generosity to the college's Dunsink observatory. In 1895 the Royal Astronomical Society awarded Roberts the gold medal for his photographs of star clusters and nebulae. The presentation address was delivered by Captain William Abney, a leading authority on photography.<br>
<br>While sailing on the <i>Norse King</i>, on his way to Vads&oslash;, Norway, to observe the total solar eclipse of 9 August 1896, Roberts met <a name="cosubject_59851"></a><span class="headword">Dorothea Klumpke</span>  (1861&#150;1942)<span class="occ"></span>; despite the difference in their ages, their friendship developed, and they married in 1901. Dorothea was born in San Francisco, one of five gifted daughters of a failed goldminer who later made a fortune in real estate. Their mother believed that her daughters should have the same educational advantage as men, and, as this was impossible in San Francisco, placed them in schools in Germany, Switzerland, and France, and herself settled in Paris. Dorothea gained her bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Sorbonne in 1886 and joined the Paris observatory to assist the astro-photographers. When the international Carte du Ciel project was set up, Dorothea, with her linguistic abilities and expertise, competed against fifty men to become the first woman to head a department at the observatory. In 1893 she became the first woman to gain a mathematics doctorate, with a treatise on Saturn's rings. In 1899 she ascended to over 1600 feet in a balloon to observe the Leonid meteor shower. After her marriage to Roberts she settled at Starfield, where she assisted him with his photography. Roberts had no children from either marriage.<br>
<br>Roberts was apolitical but held strong liberal views. Like his friend Lockyer, he was concerned with education. He made bequests for the foundation of scholarships in the University of Liverpool and in the university colleges of Wales, Bangor, and Cardiff, where he was a governor. He died suddenly of a heart attack at his home on 17 July 1904. On 21 July 1908 his cremated remains were interred in a granite monument at Flaybrick cemetery, Birkenhead. Decorated with ancient Egyptian motifs, the memorial stone had no religious symbols, but bore instead a bas-relief of the great Andromeda nebula.<br>
<br>After Roberts's death Dorothea returned to France with the photographic plates taken with the 20 inch reflector. In 1929 she issued <span class="italic">The Isaac Roberts Atlas of 52 Regions: a Guide to William Herschel's Fields of Nebulosity</span>. In 1934 she was elected a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. About this time she returned to San Francisco, where she established prizes in astronomy and mathematics at the University of California and made other donations to encourage astronomy. She died at San Francisco on 5 October 1942.<br>
