<span class="headword">Eyre, Sir  Giles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1635, <em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the eldest son of Giles Eyre (<i>bap</i>. 1608, <i>d</i>. 1685) of Brickworth, Whiteparish, Wiltshire, and Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1617), daughter of Sir Richard Norton, first baronet, of Rotherfield, East Tisted, Hampshire. He was baptized on 28 May 1635 at Downton, Wiltshire. Eyre may have attended Winchester College in 1647, and was admitted to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1653. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 19 October 1654 and was called to the bar on 7 November 1661. Meanwhile he had been elected to parliament for Downton in 1660, and proceeded to join the opposition grouping under Lord Wharton. On 2 August he moved to lay aside the debate on the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> and may have been a moderate dissenter in favour of comprehension. After a double return at the general election of 1661 he abandoned his seat. On 18 November 1662 Eyre was licensed to marry Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1644/5), daughter of Sir John Ryves of Ranston, Shroton, Dorset. She died on 15 January 1668, aged twenty-three, having borne three sons. By July 1673 (when their first child was born) Eyre had married Christabella (<i>b</i>. 1654/5), daughter of John Wyndham of Tale Payhembury, Devon. Their daughter Dorothy (1678/9&#150;1725) married the physician Richard Frewin (1680/81&#150;1761).<br>
<br>Eyre seems to have collected local offices, serving as recorder of Newport, Isle of Wight, 1675&#150;84 and 1688&#150;95, and Southampton 1681&#150;90. He also held the office of deputy recorder of Salisbury in 1675, and actively exerted himself in procuring a new charter, receiving a tankard worth &pound;10 in recognition of his services. He succeeded as recorder on the death of the incumbent in 1681, but he was in turn replaced when the corporation charter was surrendered in October 1684. James II's agents had high hopes that Eyre, sympathetic to dissent, would be returned to the parliament expected in 1688; in 1687 he was described as &#145;a lawyer, a strong dissenter; he manages my Lord Arundell of Warders [<i>sic</i>] concerns&#146;  (Duckett, 208). Arundell was a Roman Catholic peer, which they felt augured well for support for James II's religious policies: he &#145;hath been very violent, but ambitious of honour, and supposed he will be right to reconcile himself to your majesty&#146;  (ibid., 224). When James II restored the corporation in October 1688 Eyre returned to the recordership. He represented Salisbury in the convention of 1689, spoke in favour of retaining the word &#145;abdicated&#146; in the resolution declaring the throne vacant in the conference with the House of Lords, and supported the bill declaring the convention a regular parliament. He also played a minor role in the committee and debates which led to the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span>. Indeed, he may have been the author of <span class="italic">Reflections upon the late great revolution: written by a lay-hand in the country for the satisfaction of some neighbours</span>, which was a defence of the settlement.<br>
<br>Eyre's parliamentary career came to an end upon his appointment as judge of king's bench on 4 May 1689, and its concomitant creation as a serjeant-at-law. He was knighted on 31 October 1689. When called upon to give his opinion to the Lords on the surrender of charters Eyre believed that they could be surrendered if there was agreement within the corporation, and that surrender was possible because &#145;otherwise it is to set up a perpetuity, which the law always avoids&#146;  (Halliday, 274, 276n.). One of his judicial tasks was to preside over the trial of several suspected Jacobites at Manchester in October 1694, at which the defendants were found not guilty. Eyre died on 2 June 1695 at his London home in Red Lion Square, and was buried ten days later with his first wife in Whiteparish church. His widow married, on 27 March 1699 (aged forty-four), Lord Glasfoord, a needy Scottish Catholic, although she apparently abandoned him in the Fleet prison that same year. Her will was proved in February 1711.<br>
