<span class="headword">O'Brien <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ball]</span>,  Anna Maria</span>  (1785&#150;1871), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born at 5 Werburgh Street, Dublin, the second of five children of John Ball (1728&#150;1804), silk merchant, and his second wife, Mable Clare Bennett (<i>d</i>. 1831). Like many wealthy Irish Catholic girls she was educated at the Bar Convent, York, England (1800&#150;03). On 12 November 1805 Anna Maria Ball married John O'Brien, a Dublin businessman, to whom she brought a dowry of &pound;5000. The couple remained childless, although they adopted the three children of Anna Maria's half-brother, John Ball, after his death in 1812. Mrs O'Brien also engaged in philanthropic activities, directed primarily at rescuing young girls: in 1809, with some other women, she opened a house of refuge in Ash Street, Dublin.<br>
<br>In 1807 Cecilia Ball, Anna Maria's sister, entered the Ursuline convent in Cork as a novice, and Mrs O'Brien and her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1212/', "Frances Ball (1794&#150;1861)")</script>, who was to form the Congregation of Loreto Sisters in 1821, accompanied her on the journey. While in Cork, Mrs O'Brien met Mary Aikenhead (1787&#150;1858), whom she invited to come to Dublin. Aikenhead arrived there the following year, and the two engaged in charitable work in the city. The Revd Daniel Murray (1768&#150;1852) was a regular visitor to the O'Brien house and a close friend of Mrs O'Brien, who attended mass every day in his private oratory in Dublin. In 1809 Murray became archbishop, and coadjutor to the see of Dublin. He was keen to establish a religious congregation of nuns in the city to engage in charitable work and O'Brien introduced him to Aikenhead as a possible founder of such an enterprise: a friendship developed between Murray and Aikenhead, which led to the foundation of the Sisters of Charity in 1815.<br>
<br>Mrs O'Brien became intimately connected with the new religious congregation. Not only did she provide funding for a number of its enterprises but she also engaged in philanthropic work with the community. The Ash Street house of refuge was put in the Sisters' care, and when the nuns engaged in prison visitation, she accompanied them. When the Sisters of Charity thought of establishing a hospital in Dublin, Mrs O'Brien and her husband travelled to Paris with three nuns sent to train there in 1833. When the Sisters took over the Kings Inns Street primary schools, she was, most unusually, appointed their manager; she was also credited with supporting a large number of orphanages in Dublin city in the early years of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Mrs O'Brien suffered from senility in the last two years of her life and died on 28 March 1871, at her home, 5 Mountjoy Square, Dublin. She was part of a community of wealthy Catholic women who, working closely with powerful clerics, played a key role in developing religious communities of nuns during the early nineteenth century, as well as a network of lay Catholic philanthropy which worked closely with convent communities.<br>
