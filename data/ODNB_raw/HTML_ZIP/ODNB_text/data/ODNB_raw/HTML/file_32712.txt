<span class="headword">Darbyshire,  Alfred</span>  (1839&#150;1908), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 20 June 1839 at 8 Peru Street, Salford, Lancashire, the son of William Darbyshire, manager of a dyeworks, and his wife, Mary Bancroft. He was a nephew of George Bradshaw, originator of the railway guide. Of an old Quaker family, he went to Quaker schools, first that of Charles Cumber at Manchester, then Ackworth School, near Pontefract (1851&#150;4), and finally Lindow Grove Academy at Alderley, Cheshire. He was articled to the architect Peter Bradshaw Alley, of Lane and Alley, Manchester, in 1855 and remained in the office until 1862, when he went into practice for himself. He married on 10 August 1870 Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of William Marshall of Westmorland, with whom he had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Alfred Waterhouse had been articled to Alley's partner Richard Lane and Darbyshire admired Waterhouse's adaptation of Gothic to modern circumstances. But he was not a committed Goth. In competitions for Macclesfield town hall (1864), Pendleton town hall (1865), and the Manchester exchange (1866) he submitted alternative Gothic and classical designs, and the classical one&#151;&#145;French Italian&#146;, as he described it&#151;was successful at Pendleton.<br>
<br>Darbyshire's reputation, however, was chiefly that of a theatrical architect. At one stage he considered becoming an actor, and had many theatrical friends. In Manchester he built the Comedy Theatre (1884; later called the Gaiety) and carried out alterations at the Theatre Royal and the Prince's. He also designed a theatre at Rawtenstall, Lancashire. In London he altered and decorated the Lyceum Theatre in 1878 for Henry Irving, with whom he developed the &#145;Irving&#150;Darbyshire safety plan&#146;, which he described in a publication of 1884. It was intended to make the audience safe from fire by isolating the separate parts of the theatre and providing two fireproof escape routes from every part of the house, and was first fully implemented in his rebuilding of the Exeter theatre (1889) after a disastrous fire in 1887. In his last major theatre, the Palace of Varieties, Manchester, an audience of 3000 people could be cleared in a few minutes. His other buildings include: Alston Hall, Lancashire (1876); the churches of St Cyprian (1899) and St Ignatius (1900) in Salford; and the Carnegie Library in Knutsford, Cheshire (1903&#150;4). Many of these works were designed with Frederick Bennett Smith (<i>b</i>. 1863), a pupil of Alley's who joined Darbyshire in partnership from about 1885 to 1905. He also produced designs for temporary exhibitions, including a military bazaar at Manchester in 1884, a great Shakespearian show in the Royal Albert Hall, London, in the same year, and the old Manchester section of the Royal Jubilee Exhibition at Manchester in 1887. &#145;No job was too small for Darbyshire&#146;, wrote Cecil Stewart  (<span class="italic">The Stones of Manchester</span>, 105).<br>
<br>Darbyshire was an amateur actor and a friend of actors, in particular Charles Calvert, whom he assisted in the production of his Shakespearian revivals at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester (1864&#150;74), and Henry Irving, who was a stock actor at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in the mid-1860s. When he took leave of Lancashire in 1865, Darbyshire played the part of Polonius to Irving's Hamlet. In the Calvert memorial performances at Manchester in October 1879 he was instrumental in obtaining the assistance of Tom Taylor, Herman Merivale, Lewis Wingfield, and Helen Faucit, who gave her last performance as Rosalind, with Darbyshire acting the part of Jacques.<br>
<br>In 1869 Darbyshire was one of the original members of the Brasenose Club, Manchester. He was elected an associate of the Institute of British Architects in 1864, fellow in 1870, and vice-president 1902&#150;5. He was elected FSA in 1894. From 1901 to 1903 he was president of the Manchester Society of Architects, and did much to encourage the foundation of a chair of architecture at Manchester University. He was a member of the Society of Friends. A keen student of heraldry, his collection of books on that subject is in the John Rylands Library, Manchester. Besides several pamphlets and lectures, Darbyshire published <span class="italic">The Booke of Olde Manchester and Salford</span> (1887), <span class="italic">A Chronicle of the Brasenose Club, Manchester</span> (2 vols., 1892&#150;1900), <span class="italic">An Architect's Experiences: Professional, Artistic, and Theatrical</span> (1897), and <span class="italic">The Art of the Victorian Stage</span> (1907). He died at Manchester Infirmary on 5 July 1908, and was buried at Flixton church. Even one of his obituarists made the common mistake of confusing him with H. A. Darbishire, another architect, by wrongly crediting him with the design of Columbia market, Bethnal Green, London (dem.).<br>
