<span class="headword">Barclay,  John</span>  (1733&#150;1798), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and founder of the Berean church</span>, was born in Muthill, Perthshire, in March 1733, the son of Ludovick Barclay, a farmer and miller, and his wife, Martha MacInnes. He proceeded from the village school to the University of St Andrews, where he graduated MA in 1755. Thereafter he studied divinity at St Mary's College, St Andrews, and was strongly influenced by the teaching of Archibald Campbell, who taught that no knowledge of God was possible from creation through fallen reason. In his writings and preaching Barclay developed this precept into a firm affirmation that all knowledge of God comes directly from the scriptures.<br>
<br>After serving as a private tutor in the parish of Crieff, Barclay was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Auchterarder on 27 September 1759 and became assistant to the Revd James Jobson of Errol, a Marrow sympathizer. Despite deep disagreements between the two, Barclay remained in Errol until 1763, when he became assistant to the Revd Antony Dow at Fettercairn, where he lived until Dow's death in August 1772. In Fettercairn, Barclay gained a reputation as a preacher, and crowds, including many from neighbouring parishes, filled the church. Despite his youthful appearance &#145;his fervid manner, in prayer especially, impressed the minds of his audience &hellip; He had a most luxuriant fancy and a great taste for poetry&#146;  (Cameron, 201). While at Fettercairn he published <span class="italic">A Paraphrase of the Book of Psalms</span> (1766) and <span class="italic">Rejoice Forever</span> (1767), which contains 196 hymns based on scripture passages. Barclay set his hymns to popular tunes and wrote a large amount of verse. In both works he maintained that the psalms should be interpreted in such a way that Christ is the speaker in all first person passages. This view was questioned by the presbytery of Fordoun. In 1769 he addressed a letter to James Smith and Robert Ferrier, founders of the Old Scots Independents, on <span class="italic">The Eternal Generation of the Son of God</span>, in which he supported the orthodox doctrine, and in the same year he wrote <span class="italic">Without Faith, without God</span>, in which he attacked the whole system of Scottish education because it was founded on the premise of natural revelation: &#145;pretended reason murders faith&#146;  (Barclay, 126). With the publication of <span class="italic">The Assurance of Faith Vindicated</span> in 1771, Barclay's peculiar views were now in print: there is no natural revelation; God reveals himself in sovereign acts throughout scripture; the psalms must always be interpreted as referring to Christ; assurance is of the essence of faith, which is an intellectual act; the sin against the Holy Ghost is unbelief.<br>
<br>For the parishioners of Fettercairn Barclay was the natural successor to Dow in 1772. However, the presbytery, the synod, and finally the general assembly of May 1773 upheld the claim of a rival candidate, Robert Foote. Barclay had as his advocate at the general assembly James Boswell. He was also refused a certificate of character by the presbytery, and he separated himself from the Church of Scotland. A group of supporters in Edinburgh invited him to become their pastor, and he received ordination by a classis of the Presbyterian church at Newcastle upon Tyne. Meanwhile in Fettercairn the great majority of the parish seceded and built a meeting-house at Sauchieburn in the parish of Marykirk, where for several years James McRae, inducted by Barclay, had over one thousand hearers. This congregation, which sought fellowship with Congregational churches in Dundee and Newburgh (Fife), survived until 1854.<br>
<br>The name Berean (from <span class="roman">Acts</span> 17: 11) was probably chosen by Barclay himself for his followers, who were also known as Barclayans and Barclayites. Churches were founded in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Crieff, Montrose, Kirkcaldy, and other centres of independent church activity in Scotland. Between 1776 and 1778 Barclay was in London, where several churches, along with a debating society, were established; there was also a church for a time in Bristol. Barclay was a good classical scholar, well read in the theology of his day, &#145;a metaphysician rather than a prophet, an acute reasoner rather than an inspirational visionary&#146;  (Miller, 2.521). He made quite exclusive claims for his church, which by 1850 was a tiny remnant, rousing itself in Glasgow to a last effort by republishing an eight-volume collection of Barclay's <span class="italic">Works</span> in 1852.<br>
<br>The Berean churches were notable as small, exclusive, and close-knit fellowships. Apart from Barclay himself they did not attract many educated men, and pastors were chosen from the congregation, but appointed by Barclay or his successor. Worship was similar to that of the Glasites and Scotch Baptists, communion being celebrated monthly. Most Bereans maintained paedobaptism, but in Glasgow and Dundee Baptist Bereans are recorded. Despite their general adherence to Calvinist orthodoxy, their strong doctrine of assurance led to their being suspected of antinomianism, and &#145;Berean&#146; became a term of abuse in the controversy surrounding John Macleod Campbell and Edward Irving in the 1830s. David Thom of the Scottish kirk in Liverpool became in the 1820s a strong advocate of Barclay's views. He was deposed from the ministry, began an independent cause and reached a somewhat &#145;advanced&#146; theological position.<br>
<br>Barclay was married twice, without children, although further details are unknown. He received a &#145;small property&#146; through his first wife, but struggled with poverty most of his life. He died on 29 July 1798 in the house of a friend and in the presence of his nephew John Barclay, a well-known Edinburgh physician. He was buried in the old Calton cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
