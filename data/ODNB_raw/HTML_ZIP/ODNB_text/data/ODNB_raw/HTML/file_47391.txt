<span class="headword">Spencer <span class="st"> [<em>married names </em>Stanley, Egerton]</span>,  Alice</span>, countess of Derby  (1559&#150;1637), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, the youngest of eight daughters of Sir John Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1586) of Althorp, Northamptonshire, and Katherine Kytson, eldest daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Kytson of London, was born at Althorp on 4 May 1559. The family acquired great wealth through skilful land management and sheep farming, and all the daughters were amply provided for in their marriages. Alice lived in Spencer homes in Althorp, Wormleighton, and London, where she was probably schooled in music, literature, and religion. Musicians and minstrels made regular visits to the family. In her late teens she moved into court life with her elder sisters, who married nobles and landed gentlemen. <br>
<br>Alice married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26269/', "Ferdinando Stanley, Lord Strange")</script>, heir to the earldom of Derby, secretly in 1579/80. Since he and his mother, Margaret, countess of Derby, were potential successors to Elizabeth I, the marriage caused considerable suspicion, especially as it had been promoted by the earl of Leicester  (Fogle, 9&#150;10). It brought Alice a significant dowry. They had three daughters, Anne (1580&#150;1647), Frances (1583&#150;1636) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65143/', "Egerton, Frances")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40549/', "Elizabeth Hastings, n&#233;e Stanley (bap. 1587, d. 1633)")</script>. Anne went on to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3804/', "Grey Brydges, fifth Baron Chandos")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66794/', "Mervin Touchet")</script>, the notorious second earl of Castlehaven. <br>
<br>A beautiful, well-educated, and cultured woman, Alice entered the queen's household and became prominent at court. Ferdinando, one of the richest noblemen in the country, sponsored actors and playwrights and wrote poetry. She became particularly fond of Ferdinando's London residence in Holborn, and of the family seat in Lancashire at Knowsley, known as the northern court, which had a staff of 143 by 1590. She encouraged the visitation of acting companies in the 1580s, when the Queen's Men, Earl of Leicester's Men, and Earl of Essex's Men appeared there many times. <br>
<br>After Ferdinando's death in 1594, his own company, Lord Strange's Men, became the Countess of Derby's Men. This was the company that merged with the Lord Chamberlain's Men in 1594, with Shakespeare as chief playwright. In the years 1584&#150;94 Alice and Ferdinando were celebrated by Robert Greene, Thomas Nash, and Edmund Spenser as great sponsors of music, poetry, and literature. Spenser dedicated works to Alice and her sisters for their patronage, and to her daughters, thanking Alice for her &#145;private bands of affinitie&#146;. She performed frequently in masques before the court, and was a masquer in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Blackness</span>, performed in the winter of 1605. A number of writers patronized by Alice and Ferdinando reciprocated by dedicating works to the noble couple. These included John Davies of Hereford, John Harrington, Henry Lok, John Marston, Greene, Nash, and Spenser. Alice received special dedications to herself from Davies, Harrington, Lok, and Spenser. <br>
<br>Ferdinando died without male heirs, making Alice a highly eligible young dowager countess sporting three attractive unmarried daughters. While Ferdinando left his unentailed lands to Alice and his daughters, his younger brother William succeeded to an earldom that was deep in debt. He decided not to give over title to any Stanley lands to Alice and her daughters, and a series of bitter legal contests ensued that were not resolved until an act of parliament in 1609. After a complicated series of transactions in October 1600 Alice secretly married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8594/', "Sir Thomas Egerton")</script>, her daughter Frances being betrothed to his son and heir, John. Sir Thomas had a chancery decree confirm the descent of the Derby lands in the midlands to Alice for her life, passing to Frances and John and their heirs. Once the couple obtained the queen's dispensation, Egerton purchased for Alice in 1601 Harefield House in Middlesex, which she refurbished. They entertained Elizabeth at York House, London, in 1601, and in 1602 they hosted her royal progress at Harefield with one of the most lavish entertainments of the era that cost over &pound;2000. <br>
<br>Alice brought a number of books to Egerton's library, and shared in building the famous collection. She also used York House as her central London abode, entertaining ladies Bedford, Carey, Clifford, Montgomery, and others. The couple's relationship, however, was not always pleasant as Egerton, a careful counter of coin, did not appreciate her lavish spending and entertaining. He did, however, purchase the Stanley manor of Ellesmere in 1600 for the family title, and forced William, Ferdinando's successor, to settle &pound;20,000 upon Alice and her daughters in 1600. William's inability to meet these stiff conditions led to Egerton's forcing his buy-out of the heirs for nearly &pound;30,000 in 1609. This included Alice's alleged title to the descent of the Isle of Man  (Coward, 45&#150;9). <br>
<br>After the death of Egerton in 1617 Alice lived at Harefield House as a &#145;rural queen&#146;. She travelled between there and the estates of her daughters and sons-in-law (the countess and earl of Bridgewater and the countess and earl of Huntingdon) at Ashridge, Hertfordshire, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. Harefield House became a cultural community. Preparing her grandchildren for social and public life, she employed schoolteachers and musicians, and provided for lavish masques in which the grandchildren acted. Henry Lawes, a neighbouring musician, was hired as their music master. It has been suggested that Alice patronized the young John Milton for a non-clerical career  (Brown, 12&#150;14), and that the success of <span class="italic">Arcades</span> for her seventy-fifth birthday on 4 May 1634 led to the family's approval of his collaboration on <span class="italic">Comus</span> for Bridgewater's installation as lord president of the council in the marches of Wales at Ludlow Castle. Milton had written <span class="italic">Arcades</span> in her honour near Harefield in 1632. When it was staged and directed by William Lawes at Harefield, Alice played a part in pastoral habit and was joined by her grandchildren. Milton wrote:<blockquote>
<div>Mark what radiant state she spreads,<br>
</div>
<div>In circle round her shining throne,<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Sitting like a Goddess bright, In the centre of her light.<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Such a rural Queen All Arcadia hath not seen.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Milton: Complete Poems</span>, 77)</blockquote>Alice died in January 1637 at Harefield House and was buried at the church of St Mary the Virgin in Harefield, Middlesex. She wrote the directions for her burial in her will. A devout woman, she gave clothes and money to the poor of Cobham, Harefield, Hillingdon, and Weybridge, and created a charitable trust for a hospital for the poor with religious education to be built in Hillingdon with her arms as its seal. She also set out in the will whom her grandson George, Baron Chandos, would marry, and the monetary penalties if the marriage did not take place. Providing carefully for each of her servants, children, and many grandchildren, she charged them to live in peace without altercation. An independent woman who dedicated her life to bringing up her children and grandchildren, often in tragic circumstances, the countess pursued the cultural life with zest, striving to attain the highest standards of an Elizabethan woman in an age of declining moral values.<br>
