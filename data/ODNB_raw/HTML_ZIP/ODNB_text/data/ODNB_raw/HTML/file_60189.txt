<span class="headword">Field,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1751), <span class="occ">pugilist and criminal</span>, was probably born in Ireland; his parents are unknown. Since he was often referred to in the press of the period as Field the Sailor, it may be presumed that some of his early life was spent at sea. His first major fistic contest in London, the centre of pugilistic activity at the time, appears to have been against Benjamin Boswell at the Great Booth, Tottenham Court, on 15 November 1743. It also seems to have been Field's d&eacute;but at stage fighting, although his inexperience at this form of combat did not prevent him from prevailing over the noted Boswell.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1743, again at the Great Booth, Field was matched with George Taylor the Barber, and was forced to yield after a determined battle. He was beaten once more by the renowned Taylor on the twentieth of that month, on this occasion at Broughton's Amphitheatre in the Oxford Road. Field blamed both defeats on being a novice on the stage when a third encounter with Taylor was advertised to take place at the Great Booth on 13 March 1744. He evidently intended this to be his last contest, and does not seem to have appeared at either of these venues for a considerable period afterwards. However, he was scheduled to fight John Slack at Broughton's Amphitheatre on 18 May 1748 and again on 18 January of the following year. The two certainly met on 9 February 1749 in a gruelling battle which eventually ended in favour of Slack after about ninety-two minutes. Advertisements in a contemporary newspaper also show that Field was due to oppose Slack on 12 April and the Derbyshire life-guardsman Thomas Hawksl(e)y on 21 June of the same year.<br>
<br>Field's criminal activities seem to have covered a wide range of felonies. The <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span> (13&#150;15 December 1750) noted that there had been several warrants granted against him by Justice Fielding for &#145;Robberies on the Highway, Burglaries, Rescues, and other Crimes&#146;. This statement appeared shortly after the pugilist's arrest on 6 December 1750 at the Fox alehouse in Drury Lane, London. He was apprehended only after a severe struggle, and the following day was committed to Newgate prison. His trial took place at the Old Bailey on 16 January 1751, when he was accused of robbing one David Woodman of a pair of spectacles, a tobacco box, a handkerchief, and 13<i>s</i>. Although Field had previously impeached twenty-eight members of a gang to which he belonged, this did not earn him a reprieve. He was condemned to death, and hanged at Tyburn on 11 February 1751. Because of fears that an attempt to rescue him would be made by his fellow bruisers, he was transported to the place of execution with his legs chained together. As was customary when a well-known person was hanged, Field's purported life story was published in pamphlet form. It was sold for 3<i>d</i>., and advertisements for it included a comment attributed to the pugilist: &#145;They have knock'd me down;&#150;this is the hardest Cross-Buttock I ever had in my Life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Penny London Post</span>, 18&#150;20 Feb 1751).<br>
<br>Field's notoriety was reflected by the fact that in the same month as he was hanged his name appeared twice in a series of four prints on the subject of cruelty by William Hogarth. In the <span class="italic">Second Stage of Cruelty</span> a sign on a wall, above one for cock-fighting, advertised a fight at Broughton's Amphitheatre between Field and George Taylor. In the final print in the series, <span class="italic">The Reward of Cruelty</span>, Field's name was shown above the skeleton on display on the left-hand side of the print. A James Field, reputed to be a first cousin of Field the Sailor, also competed pugilistically about the same period. His opponents included the active and well-regarded William Chetham.<br>
