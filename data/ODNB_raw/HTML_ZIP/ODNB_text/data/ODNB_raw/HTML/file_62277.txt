<span class="headword">Norman,  Frederick</span>  (1897&#150;1968), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born Ferdinand Krott on 10 November 1897 at 378 Lillie Road, Fulham, London, the second child and eldest of three sons of a German couple, Johann Heinrich (Harry) Krott (1853/4&#150;1906) and his wife, Clara Jane (Jenny), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wulff (1871/2&#150;1951). His birth certificate gave his date of birth as 23 November (the doctor apparently recommending his mother to post-date his birth to avoid falling foul of the time-limit for registering it), and he continued this pretence in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry, which also included incorrect information concerning his parentage and the date of his marriage. His parents ran a laundry. Following his father's death his mother married, in 1907, Albert Edward Norman, at the time of their marriage a journeyman plumber; her children did not adopt their stepfather's surname until about 1918. Her unmarried brother Willy Wulff, a fairly prosperous Hamburg businessman, made himself responsible for the education of his English nephew Ferdinand (known as Fred). After a private school in London he was enrolled in a school at Hamburg. In Germany when war broke out in August 1914, when he was not yet seventeen, he declined an &#145;invitation&#146; to join the German army, so he was interned along with some 4200 merchant sailors, businessmen, students, and hapless tourists after the German authorities decided that autumn to incarcerate all British males aged from seventeen to fifty-five in retaliation for measures taken against &#145;enemy aliens&#146; in Britain. Friedrich Krott (as he meanwhile called himself) was confined in the civilian internment camp on the racecourse at Ruhleben, near Spandau, on the outskirts of Berlin, where, despite very primitive conditions, inmates lived under a relatively benign German regime. As one of the youngest internees, Krott was known as &#145;Bimbo&#146; (from <i>bambino</i>), a name that stuck. Of the thirty or so German classmates who had read Homer with him at Hamburg in 1914, he was the only one to survive the war.<br>
<br>Following his release in late November 1918, shortly after his twenty-first birthday, Frederick Norman (as he now called himself) studied German at University College, London, under Robert Priebsch and John George Robertson, graduating BA in 1922 and proceeding MA with distinction in 1925. Even before he graduated Priebsch persuaded Gregory Foster, provost of University College, to appoint Norman as assistant lecturer in German from September 1922. On 21 March 1924 Norman married Elsie (Elizabeth) Dixon (1900&#150;1955), daughter of the artist and book illustrator Arthur Augustus Dixon; a witness at their wedding at Hackney register office was George Merritt, another former Ruhleben inmate and later a noted film and television actor. The couple had first met at the 1917 Club in Gerrard Street, Soho, a left-wing club formed to celebrate the Russian Revolution; Norman had left-wing sympathies and was persuaded in the 1930s by Hugh Gaitskell to join the Labour Party.<br>
<br>As well as teaching at University College, from 1926 to 1930 Norman headed the German department at the University of Reading. From 1930 to 1937 he held a readership in German jointly at University College, London, and King's College, London. In 1937, having been thwarted in his ambition to succeed Priebsch as professor at University College, he was appointed to the chair of German at King's College, holding it until his retirement in 1965. In 1966 he became Mellon professor at the University of Pittsburgh.<br>
<br>While interned at Ruhleben, Norman had become a friend of a fellow internee, John (Jock) Balfour, who later joined the Foreign Office (and ended his career as ambassador to Spain). In 1933 he sent Balfour a detailed letter describing the atmosphere in Germany, which Balfour passed on to his superiors; so impressed were they that Norman was invited to advise the Foreign Office on matters German. In the later 1930s he regularly broadcast to Germany, recruited German speakers for the BBC's broadcasting team, and translated many of Hitler's speeches for the benefit of the British government (he deemed the F&uuml;hrer's German &#145;execrable&#146;). From the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 until 1945 he was involved with military intelligence work at Bletchley Park. From the start he played a leading role in Hut 3 where his team sifted German army and air force decrypts for information that might indicate technological or scientific innovations, thus providing advance warning of the details of German secret weapons. Among men with whom he worked there were several German scholars, including a number of his own pupils who later, partly thanks to his patronage&#151;Norman always considered himself the key player in British German studies&#151;obtained chairs at universities around the country. On 23 November 1943 he made a discovery of major significance: in elucidating an intercepted German radio message he brilliantly deduced that &#145;Heuschrecke&#146;, the German code name for an important reporting station, was a pun on the small Baltic islet of Oie, near Greifswald, which provided vital information to the whereabouts of the headquarters of a radar tracking detachment essential to the work of the experimental V1 and V2 rocket range at Peenem&uuml;nde. As the war progressed, Norman, a linguist with no science, became a key associate providing intelligence to a scientist with no German, R. V. Jones, assistant director of intelligence (science), in the Air Ministry. In April 1945 Norman, with the honorary rank of wing commander, was involved in investigating Werner Heisenberg's experimental nuclear pile at Haigerloch, near Stuttgart. Subsequently he played an advisory role with the British control commissions in Germany and Austria, and also worked for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research after the war, on behalf of Bertie Blount, who was responsible for scientific research in the British zone of occupation in Germany. He also kept in touch with R. V. Jones and indeed, meeting in the Athenaeum in 1958, he floated with him the idea of making a small fortune by jointly writing a book revealing&#151;notwithstanding the constraints of the <span class="roman">Official Secrets Act</span> (Norman always had a rebellious streak about him)&#151;the nature of their wartime work. In 1947 he was appointed OBE, the citation describing him as having been &#145;employed in a Department of the Foreign Office&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, 6 June 1947).<br>
<br>Back at King's College from 1945, the number of staff, undergraduates, and postgraduates in German increased three- or fourfold under Norman's guidance, thanks to the rare blend of enthusiasm and realism that enabled him at all times to discern academic needs of the future and to raise the funds to implement them. The teaching of postgraduates was one of his great strengths, and with his support his pupils obtained senior positions in universities in Britain, the USA, and Germany. He was a member of the senate of the University of London from 1938 to 1966, and deputy vice-chancellor from 1962 to 1964. At various periods he was a member of the governing bodies of several of the university's schools and institutes. He was closely involved with the planning for the University of Kent, founded in 1965. From 1956 to 1965 he was director of the University of London Institute of Germanic Studies (a part-time appointment which, to his chagrin, he failed to have converted into a full-time paid post). In 1965 he was appointed European academic director of the Chicago Institute of European Studies, becoming its academic vice-president shortly before his death in 1968. Many honours came to him: he became a fellow of University College, London (1936), of the Society of Antiquaries of London (1949), and of King's College, London (1954), he was awarded the gold medal of the Goethe Institut (1964), and in 1965 the German Academy for Language and Literature, Darmstadt, awarded him its prize for German studies abroad. Yet his proudest boast was to be the only professor with a private bathroom at a college in London, a relic from the days when the premises occupied by the King's German department had been a pub on the Strand.<br>
<br>Norman was a brilliant and energetic personality, an enthralling lecturer, a stimulating and witty conversationalist, a competent pianist, a lover of classical music, and a balletomane, and his erudition was such that he either fascinated or terrified his students. Colleagues and students knew him for a hard, yet just, taskmaster. To work with him was an object lesson in the art of getting things done. He possessed an excellent knowledge and command of various German dialects. At the drop of a hat he could digress and give a learned disquisition on the etymology of any word. His ambidexterity enabled him to write different things with each hand on the blackboard simultaneously and legend has it that he even marked two piles of school certificate scripts at once in order to finance a ticket for a whole season of the Diaghilev ballet. Such was his reputation that the fact that King's College came to be so well known in German academic circles was largely due to its being the institution to which Norman belonged. Yet, compared with his reputation, his output as a scholar was slender: he preferred the spoken word to the written. He was a prolific reviewer, once anonymously reviewing in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> Walter Dornberger's <span class="italic">V2</span> (1954), the classic account of German secret weapons by one of the men whose activities Norman had for so long been tracking at Bletchley Park, but the most substantial study from his own pen was <span class="italic">Henry Crabb Robinson and Goethe</span> (1930&#150;31), based on material in Dr Williams's Library, London. Otherwise he edited the Old English <span class="italic">Waldere</span> (1933) and, with P. F. Ganz and others, the proto-Yiddish heroic epic <span class="italic">Dukus Horant</span> (1964). Apart from two school textbooks, Gustav Schwab's <span class="italic">Die Schildb&uuml;rger</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">Selections from Hebel</span> (1928), nearly all the other publications appearing under his name were collections of essays and conference proceedings edited by him. Two books appeared in his honour: <span class="italic">Mediaeval German Studies</span> (1965), a Festschrift presented by students, colleagues, and friends to mark his retirement, and his own <span class="italic">Three Essays on the &#145;Hildebrandslied&#146;</span>, edited by A. T. Hatto as a memorial to him (1973).<br>
<br>After his first wife, who had for twenty-five years been a child psychotherapist at Guy's Hospital, died of cancer, on 3 January 1957 Norman married Martha Catherine Willis, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McNicol (1921&#150;2005), daughter of Robert Stewart McNicol, cotton yarn merchant, and former wife of Donald Willis. Each of his marriages produced one daughter, to whom he was a devoted father. He died suddenly in Vienna on 8 December 1968 and was cremated there. His ashes were interred at Bow Brickhill, Buckinghamshire. After <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1967 had abandoned its tradition of announcing births, marriages, and deaths on the front page, Norman, a man always acutely aware of his own worth, wrote to his London colleague Edna Purdie, &#145;<span class="italic">The Times</span> is becoming a quite deplorable paper. Our deaths will have to appear on the last page, which I find humiliating&#146;  (Royal Holloway, U. Lond., Purdie papers).<br>
