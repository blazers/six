<span class="headword">Pratt <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Pearless]</span>,  Anne</span>  (1806&#150;1893), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, born on 5 December 1806 in Strood, Kent, the second of three daughters of Robert Pratt (1777&#150;1819), a wholesale grocer of that town, and his wife, Sarah Bundock (1780&#150;1845), of Huguenot descent. Her childhood and youth were passed at Chatham and she was educated by a Mrs Roffey at the Eastgate House School, Rochester. Her delicate health&#151;&#145;a stiff knee&#146;&#151;rendered her unfit for active pursuits and she devoted herself to literary study. A Scottish friend, Dr Dods, undertook to teach her botany and she soon became an ardent student. Aided by her elder sister, who collected plants for her, she formed an extensive herbarium and supplemented her collection by making sketches of the specimens. The drawings afterwards formed illustrations for her books.<br>
<br>Anne Pratt left Chatham in 1846 and went to live with friends at Brixton and other places, but subsequently settled at Dover in 1849. There she wrote her principal work, <span class="italic">The Flowering Plants and Ferns of Great Britain</span>. Other changes of residence followed. On 4 December 1866 she married John Pearless (1809&#150;1893), a rentier, of East Grinstead, Sussex. They lived at East Grinstead for two and a half years, after which they settled for some years at Redhill, Surrey. Anne died on 27 July 1893 at Rylett Road, Shepherd's Bush, London.<br>
<br>Anne Pratt's works were written in popular style but were said to be accurate. They were also instrumental in spreading a knowledge and love of botany, and were at one time acknowledged by a grant from the civil list. Her first, <span class="italic">The Field, the Garden, and the Woodland</span>, was published in 1838 and reached a third edition in less than ten years. Perhaps her most popular, especially among children, <span class="italic">Wild Flowers</span> (2 vols., 1852), was also issued in sheets for hanging up in schoolrooms. <span class="italic">The Flowering Plants and Ferns of Great Britain</span>, published in five volumes from 1855, was widely regarded as the best popular botanical work of her time.<br>
