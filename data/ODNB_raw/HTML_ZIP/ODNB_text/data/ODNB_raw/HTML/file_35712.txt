<span class="headword">Reich,  Emil</span>  (1854&#150;1910), <span class="occ">historian</span>, son of Louis Reich, was born on 24 March 1854 at Eperjes in Hungary. After early education in schools at Eperjes and Kassa he went to the universities of Prague, Budapest, and Vienna; at the last he became a doctor of laws. Until his thirtieth year he studied almost exclusively in libraries. He then decided&#151;finding books inadequate for &#145;a real comprehension of history&#146;&#151;to learn by travelling.<br>
<br>In July 1884 Reich, with his parents, his brother, and two sisters, emigrated to America, where after much hardship he was engaged in 1887 by the Appleton firm of New York in preparing their encyclopaedia. On his father's death, his mother and one sister settled in Budapest; the brother and other sister settled in Cincinnati, the one as a photo-engraver, the other as a public school teacher. In July 1889 Reich went to France. At the end of the year he visited Britain. In February and March 1890 he delivered at Oxford four lectures, subsequently published as <span class="italic">Graeco-Roman Institutions</span> (1890; French translation, 1891), in which he attempted to &#145;disprove the applicableness of Darwinian concepts to the solution of sociological problems&#146;. His theory of the hitherto unsuspected influence of <i>infamia</i> on Roman law at first aroused opposition, but later was developed in Britain and France. Reich spent his time mainly in France until 1893, when he married C&eacute;line Labulle of Paris and settled in Britain for good. There, as a writer, as a lecturer to popular and learned audiences in Oxford, Cambridge, and London, and as a coach at Wren's establishment for preparing candidates for the civil service, he displayed remarkable vigour, versatility, and self-confidence. His breadth of interests appealed to Lord Acton, who described him as &#145;a universal specialist&#146; and for Acton he wrote on Hungary and the Slavonic kingdoms for volume 1 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span>.<br>
<br>Reich's work, though full of stimulating suggestions, was often inaccurate in detail, and omission of essential facts discredited his conclusions. A lover of paradox, and a severe censor of established historical and literary reputations, he nevertheless made useful contributions to historical criticism in his lectures on &#145;Fundamental principles of evidence&#146; and in his <span class="italic">The Failure of the Higher Criticism of the Bible</span> (1905), in which he combated modern methods of biblical criticism. Of <span class="italic">A general history of western nations from 5000 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to 1900 <span class="smallcap">AD</span></span>, the first part, on <span class="italic">Antiquity</span>, was published in two volumes in 1908&#150;9. In it Reich laid heavy stress on environmental, geopolitical, and economic conditions. He also unjustifiably charged A. H. J. Greenidge with adopting without acknowledgement some researches of his own  (<span class="italic">Antiquity</span>, 2.339&#150;40n.); the accusation provoked a stout defence from Greenidge's friends in the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> (23 and 30 July, 13 and 20 August 1908). Reich's most successful published work was his <span class="italic">Hungarian Literature</span> (1897; 2nd edn, 1906). In the dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela (1895&#150;9) in regard to the Venezuelan boundary, Reich was engaged by the British government to help in the preparation of its case. A course of lectures on Plato at Claridge's Hotel, London, in 1906, which were attended by prominent female members of London society, brought him much public notoriety.<br>
<br>Reich published many other works on a wide variety of subjects. Especially notable are his <span class="italic">Handbook of Geography, Descriptive and Mathematical</span> (2 vols., 1908) and <span class="italic">Woman through the Ages</span> (2 vols., 1908). His attack on German militarism, <span class="italic">Germany's Swelled Head</span> (1907), was a best-seller in a revised edition by &#145;J. B. R.&#146; in 1914. Reich died after three months' illness at his home, 33 St Luke's Road, Notting Hill, London, on 11 December 1910, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. His wife, with a daughter, survived him. Reich was fond of music and was an accomplished pianist.<br>
