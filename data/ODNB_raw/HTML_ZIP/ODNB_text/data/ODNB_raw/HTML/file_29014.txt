<span class="headword">Wells <span class="st"> [Wellys]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1388), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and theological controversialist</span>, was already a monk of Ramsey Abbey, Huntingdonshire, when he was ordained priest on 7 June 1365. From at least 1374 he studied at Gloucester College, the Benedictine hall in Oxford. While at Gloucester College he was for thirteen years <i>prior studentium</i>, a position he still held in 1381. He incepted as DTh about 1376.<br>
<br>As a member of a religious order, Wells seems always to have been implacably opposed to John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) and his followers. Indeed, so determined was he in his opposition that he acquired the title Malleus Haereticorum (&#145;Hammer of Heretics&#146;). He was almost certainly the Wellys that the compiler of <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span> identifies as &#145;quidam canis niger de ordine Benedicti&#146; (&#145;a black dog of the Benedictine order&#146;; <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span>, 239), who argued with Wyclif concerning the religious orders; although the rubricator of the only extant copy of the compilation gives Wellys's first name as William, John Bale corrected the rubric to John. John Wells was also very probably the opponent Wyclif refers to as <i>dompnus niger</i>  (Wyclif, <span class="italic">Sermones</span>, 3.252), as well as the one he dismisses as speaking elaborately and diffusely, just like a monk. In 1380&#150;81 he was on William Barton's committee of twelve doctors of theology who condemned Wyclif's views on the eucharist. In 1382 he and the Carmelite Peter Stokes (<i>d</i>. 1399) complained to the new chancellor of Oxford, Robert Rygge (<i>d</i>. 1410), about a sermon Nicholas Hereford had preached in St Mary's, in which he had asserted that members of religious orders could not take degrees in the university without apostatizing. Wells was also the first to speak at the council convened in that year by Archbishop William Courtenay (<i>d</i>. 1396) at Blackfriars, London, which condemned ten of Wyclif's views as heretical and fourteen as erroneous; three of the errors correspond with views Wyclif seems to have maintained specifically against Wells. A satirical song describes Wells's arguments on this occasion as windy and feeble, just what might be expected of someone with a face the colour of gall; in words Wyclif would mockingly echo, the song then describes how Wells had been completely out-argued by Hereford in the schools.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1387 the English Benedictines sent Wells as their general proctor to Pope Urban VI, with instructions to intercede for the deprived and imprisoned Cardinal Adam Easton (<i>d</i>. 1397). Wells must have pleaded on behalf of Easton either at Lucca, where the pope was resident until 23 September, or at Perugia, where the pope then took up residence; as Easton was not reinstated until 18 December 1389, Wells's pleas were evidently unsuccessful. Wells himself died in Perugia in 1388 and was buried in the church of Santa Sabina.<br>
<br>John Bale credits Wells with <span class="italic">De socii sui ingratitudine</span>, <span class="italic">Epistolae ad diversos</span>, <span class="italic">Pro religione privata</span> (probably identical with the <span class="italic">De religione perfectorum</span> some later authorities refer to), <span class="italic">Super cleri prerogativa</span>, <span class="italic">Super eucharistiae negotio</span>, and <span class="italic">Contra Nicolaum Herefordium</span>. John Pits notes that Wells wrote many further works, almost always against heresies and heretics. All that has survived of Wells's writing is Wyclif's account of his <span class="italic">Pro religione privata</span>  (in <span class="italic">Fasciculi zizaniorum</span>, 239&#150;41).<br>
<br>On folio 6<i>v</i> of Bodl. Oxf., MS Bodley 851 (SC 3041), a fifteenth-century illumination indicates that this manuscript belonged to someone almost certainly identifiable with Wells: &#145;Iste liber constat fratri Johanni de Wellis, monacho Ramseye&#146;. Because the manuscript contains, among other items, the &#145;Z&#146; text of <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>, it has been suggested that Wells is the first known owner of any text of <span class="italic">Piers Plowman</span>. However, scholars are still debating whether the relevant part of the manuscript is early enough to have been his. The part of the manuscript he could have owned contains mainly texts by Walter Map.<br>
<br>John Wells of Ramsey should be distinguished from various contemporaries and near contemporaries with the same name, including a John Wells, also a DTh, but a Franciscan, who had goods stolen from him in London in 1377, and who may or may not have also been the John Wells who sought to procure the election of Doctor John Wylyot as chancellor of Oxford in 1349. He should also be distinguished from the Master John Wells who on 26 June 1410 moved a decree in Oxford against the works of Wyclif, and who spoke at the Council of Constance.<br>
