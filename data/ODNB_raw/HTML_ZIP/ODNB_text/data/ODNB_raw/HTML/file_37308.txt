<span class="headword">Connolly,  James</span>  (1868&#150;1916), <span class="occ">socialist and Irish revolutionary</span>, was born on 5 June 1868 at 107 Cowgate, Edinburgh, the youngest of three sons (there were no daughters) of Irish immigrants John Connolly (1832/3&#150;1900), manure carter of Edinburgh, and his wife, Mary (1832/3&#150;1890), daughter of James McGinn, labourer of Edinburgh. Brought up in the slums of Cowgate, Connolly left St Patrick's School at ten and became in turn printer's devil, bakery hand, and tiling factory worker. In 1882, falsifying his age and name, he joined the army, serving in Ireland and possibly elsewhere; hating it he deserted in 1889 at a time when both his mother and father were seriously ill. On 13 April 1889 he married Lillie Reynolds, a domestic servant from a protestant Wicklow family, whom he had met in Dublin. They had one son and six daughters.<br>
<br>From childhood Connolly had read voraciously; in the army he learned about history, politics, economics, and socialism. In April 1889 he joined the Socialist League in Dundee, then moved back to Edinburgh, where he worked as a night-soil man. He read deeply in socialist literature, even learning some French and German, and applied Marxist theory to his twin preoccupations of Irish nationalism and social inequality. A member of the Scottish Socialist Federation (SSF) from 1890 and the Independent Labour Party from shortly after its foundation in 1893, his powerful mind fed off political discussion. His published branch reports as secretary of the SSF showed that direct, trenchant writing came naturally to him; effective public speaking took longer. As a youth he had difficulty in overcoming physical handicaps that included bow legs, short sight, and a stammer, later cured. He was not tall, but was described by Daniel Figgis as &#145;sturdy of frame and broad of brow[;] he suggested, and his northern accent conveyed, the thought of a realist who lived to slay illusions&#146;  (Figgis, 87).<br>
<br>In 1894 Connolly lost his job and in 1895 failed as a cobbler, but his reputation in socialist circles throughout Scotland as an organizer and propagandist (he wrote a column in a local left-wing paper as &#145;R. Ascal&#146;), speaker and campaigner (he stood in two local elections) was high and brought him an offer in 1896 from the Dublin Socialist Club to be their paid organizer for &pound;1 per week. The salary was rarely forthcoming and Connolly had to do labouring work, but his energy was boundless; he created the Irish Socialist Republican Party (ISRP) to spread his message that socialism and nationalism were complementary and incompatible with sectarianism. Despite opposing cross-class alliances he formed a friendship with Maud Gonne, who helped to make him an early convert to female suffrage, and together they organized flamboyant anti-monarchical and anti-imperialist protests. But despite demonstrations, public meetings, numerous articles, pamphlets, poetry, and proletarian songs, and a newspaper called the <span class="italic">Workers' Republic</span> (which frequently collapsed), he won few converts, for romantic nationalism was in the ascendant: &#145;Ireland without her people is nothing to me&#146;, he wrote in frustration in 1900. And in international socialist circles, the ISRP was censured for calling for independence from Britain as well as a socialist revolution.<br>
<br>Connolly was pro-Boer and opposed to home rule, a cause which he regarded as middle class and capitalist. These views had lost him friends in Britain, though he made many speeches there in 1901, leading to an invitation to go to America on a speaking tour under the auspices of Daniel De Leon's Socialist Labor Party (SLP), which had given occasional financial help to the ISRP. De Leon, who believed that a socialist party should be as &#145;intolerant as science&#146;  (Dudley Edwards, 40), hoped that Connolly would win Irish-American recruits for the SLP and return to Ireland ideologically purer and more evangelistic. Connolly's speaking tour from September 1902 to January 1903 took him from New York to California and Canada, and though he disliked the individualism of the United States he found the trip exhilarating and raised some money for his party. On his return to Ireland what a colleague called his &#145;confoundedly disagreeable integrity and incorruptibility&#146;  (John Carstairs Matheson to Connolly, 2 March 1907, Dudley Edwards, 45) resulted in a disastrous split in the ISRP. To support his family, which had been living in grinding poverty in a squalid tenement, he first worked for the new Socialist Labour Party in Scotland, but seeing that it had no future he had to emigrate in 1903 to the United States&#151;bitterly claiming to have been driven out of Ireland by socialists.<br>
<br>During seven years in America Connolly's many jobs included agent for an insurance company, lathe operator, and union organizer. An activist in socialist, Irish, and Italian circles, in 1905 he was a co-founder of the syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World, in 1907 founder of the Irish Socialist Federation, in 1908 of <span class="italic">The Harp</span> newspaper, and in 1908&#150;9 a paid organizer for the Socialist Party of America. When he left, after numerous rows with American socialists&#151;De Leon ultimately dubbed the atheist Connolly a Jesuit agent; Connolly alleged De Leon was &#145;purposely doing the work of the capitalist class&#146;  (Connolly to Matheson, 8 Nov 1900, Dudley Edwards, 63)&#151;though the class struggle was still his main concern he had developed a new sympathy with cultural and political nationalism. Though still irascible he was mellowing, and had matured into a thinker of depth, breadth, and originality, and an orator of force and passion.<br>
<br>Back in Dublin in 1910 Connolly published a brilliant pamphlet&#151;<span class="italic">Labour, Nationality and Religion</span>&#151;refuting clerical assertions that Catholicism and socialism were incompatible, and his masterpiece, <span class="italic">Labour in Irish History</span>, which, although marked by economic determinism and his hatred of the middle-class nationalist tradition, was a ground-breaking application of international thinking to the Irish situation and deeply influenced the thinking of Patrick Pearse. Briefly national organizer of the Socialist Party of Ireland in 1910, Connolly, in 1911, became Ulster district organizer of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. Although he had some success as a union representative, increasing membership was an uphill struggle, because of both the sheer poverty of the workers and the rampant sectarianism that meant that most recruits were Roman Catholics. Indeed, while in innumerable speeches (some later printed in 1915 in pamphlet form as <span class="italic">The Reconquest of Ireland</span>) Connolly stressed the suffering of protestant workers under capitalism, he never understood unionism or the fears of Ulster protestants.<br>
<br>In 1912 Connolly was a founder of the Independent Labour Party of Ireland, and by persuading the Irish trades union conference to back the labour movement he created the conditions from which the Irish Labour Party later developed&#151;one of his most practical achievements. When in 1913 the Dublin Employers' Federation staged a lock-out to prevent workers joining the trade union Connolly returned to Dublin to rally the workers, but poverty defeated them in February 1914. In October James Larkin, whose personality cult Connolly deplored and whom he found an almost intolerable boss, left Ireland and Connolly became his highly efficient successor as general secretary of the union, editor of the <span class="italic">Irish Worker</span>, and military commander of the Irish Citizen Army, set up in November 1913 as a morale-boosting drilling scheme for locked-out workers. Appalled by the outbreak of war in 1914 Connolly launched a massive anti-recruitment drive. Its failure, combined with the dreadful suffering of the Dublin poor, drove him to join forces with the revolutionary nationalist Irish Republican Brotherhood. His influence was evident in the egalitarian wording of the proclamation declaring an Irish republic published on Easter Monday 1916. Connolly directed operations in the General Post Office capably and courageously, for the last two days with a shattered ankle. After the surrender on 29 April he was court-martialled on 9 May and shot (while seated, being unable to stand) at Kilmainham gaol, Dublin, at dawn on 12 May 1916. He was first interred at the gaol; his final resting place is at Arbour Hill cemetery, Dublin. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Connolly was the fifteenth and last of the rebels to be executed, the killing of an injured man having resulted in a public outcry. His status as a patriotic martyr was at once assured, but an appreciation of his politics took rather longer to develop: socialists disapproved of his participation in an essentially bourgeois nationalist revolution and nationalists disapproved of his socialism. The labour movement in Ireland subsequently developed along broadly non-Marxist lines, and it was only when his writings were rediscovered by civil rights activists in Northern Ireland during the 1960s that his significance as a socialist thinker began to achieve wide recognition.<br>
