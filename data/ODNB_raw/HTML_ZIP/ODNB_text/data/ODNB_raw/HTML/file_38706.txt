<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bastable,  Charles Francis</span>  (1855&#150;1945), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born at Charleville, co. Cork, the only son of the Revd Robert Bastable (1800&#150;1889), rector of Knocktemple and Kilbolane. His mother was a daughter of Dr Little of Sligo. He was educated at Fermoy College, Fermoy, co. Cork, and in 1873 entered the University of Dublin, Trinity College, where he graduated BA in 1878 with a senior moderatorship (first-class honours) in history and political science, a course which then included political economy. He proceeded to the degrees of MA in 1882 and LLD in 1890.<br>
<br>At first Bastable thought of practising law as a career, and he was called to the Irish bar in 1881; but in 1882 an opportunity of developing his interest in economic studies arose. The Whately professorship of political economy in Trinity College, Dublin, had been filled quinquennially by examination since its establishment in 1832; Bastable was the successful candidate at the examination which took place in 1882 and was appointed to the chair. At the end of his term of office in 1887 the regulations governing the post were altered; he was elected for a second term and went on to hold the position as a non-fellow professor for another forty-five years until his retirement in 1932. Thus although he had ten predecessors in the Whately chair, Bastable was the first to retain it as a professional academic economist and he became well known to other such economists throughout Europe in his time. Yet initially at least the duties of the post were not such as to occupy all the time of an established academic and the salary reflected this. Hence Bastable was compelled to seek other posts; he held the chair of jurisprudence and political economy at Queen's College, Galway, from 1883 until 1903, was appointed professor of jurisprudence and international law in Trinity College, Dublin, in 1902, and became regius professor of laws in 1908, a post which he also held until his retirement in 1932. In 1905 he was George Rae lecturer at the University College of North Wales and he was Warburton lecturer at the University of Manchester in the academic year 1909/10.<br>
<br>A founder member of the Royal Economic Society, Bastable served on its first council and contributed a total of twenty-six articles to its <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> between 1891 and 1920. At the Oxford meeting of the British Association in 1894 he was president of section F, economics and statistics. He was an honorary secretary of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland from 1886 until 1895 and one of its vice-presidents until 1915. In 1921 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. After the formation of the Irish Free State he was a member of its fiscal inquiry committee of 1923.<br>
<br>Although throughout his long teaching career Bastable always gave courses on legal subjects, his main research interest was in economics, especially in international trade, money, and public finance. In the theory of international trade he followed the broad lines of the analysis of comparative costs and reciprocal demand as first set out by David Ricardo and developed by J. S. Mill, but made significant improvements within them. These were incorporated into the successive editions of his <span class="italic">Theory of International Trade</span> (1st edn, 1887), a work which he described as &#145;specially intended for serious students of economic theory&#146;. It reached a wide audience of such students, being translated into French and Italian. <span class="italic">The Commerce of Nations</span> (1891) was a more popular book, in which Bastable, who was sympathetic to the historical method in economics as developed by his compatriots J. K. Ingram and T. E. Cliffe Leslie, took the approach &#145;that existing commercial policy and the doctrines respecting it are best explained by reference to their history&#146;. In a succinct review of the development of world trade from the seventeenth century up to his own day he did not attempt to conceal his own belief in the merits of free trade, but the conclusion which he reached was realistic and prescient:<blockquote>though we cannot expect any speedy abandonment of the protective system, which will doubtless continue for a long time, we may look for breaches in it and at intervals steady and sustained reforms, leading finally, though by slow degrees, to the adoption of complete free trade. (3rd edn, 1903, 211)</blockquote>Bastable's contributions to the classical theory of international trade gained him a more lasting, if limited, reputation than his work in public finance, to which he devoted as much, if not more, attention. In the United Kingdom in the late Victorian era, when the public sector was small and taxation low, it was a subject which was not the focus of much attention. There had been no comprehensive treatment of it since the time of J. R. McCulloch and, although he published many articles on aspects of the subject, Bastable's major contribution was that he provided just such a survey at an appropriate time. His <span class="italic">Public Finance</span> (1892) drew on his extensive knowledge of European and American as well as British writings in that field to provide a clear statement of accepted principles and practices. The book became a definitive text, a handbook for civil servants as well as academic students, which was not superseded until the 1930s, when the principles of fiscal policy which Bastable and his contemporaries regarded as fundamental were being challenged, most notably by J. M. Keynes and his followers.<br>
<br>The heavy teaching load which Bastable always carried limited his ability to produce original work in his later years. With characteristic modesty he decided against revising his <span class="italic">Public Finance</span> thoroughly, on the ground that it was a task for which a younger man, who could take a more radical approach, would be better suited. Held in high regard by his many pupils, Bastable was a reserved and very private man, who lived a secluded life after his retirement. Survived by his wife, Josephine Anna, and son, he died at his home, 52 Brighton Road, Rathgar, co. Dublin, on 3 January 1945.<br>
