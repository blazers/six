<span class="headword">Thornton,  Gilbert  of</span> <span class="st"> [Gilbert  de Bussy, Gilbert Buscy]</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1245, <em>d.</em> 1295), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of Robert de Bussy, of Thornton-le-Moor in Lincolnshire, which lies about 6 miles north-east of Market Rasen. Gilbert is himself commonly called Gilbert de Bussy of Thornton in local property deeds before the late 1280s. His appointment as the attorney of the abbot of the Lincolnshire abbey of Thornton (a different Thornton, about 15 miles to the north of Thornton-le-Moor) in 1266 indicates that he cannot have been born after 1245 and may well have been born several years earlier. One of the earliest surviving law reports shows him acting as a serjeant in the eyre of 1271&#150;2 held in his home county of Lincolnshire, and other evidence suggests that he also acted as a serjeant before the same group of eyre justices in Warwickshire in 1272. The earliest surviving report of an identifiable case heard in the common bench in which he appears as a serjeant comes from 1275, but it seems clear that he was by then already well established as one of the serjeants of the court, and reports show him appearing there on a regular basis thereafter. Late in 1280 Thornton succeeded Alan of Walkingham as the king's serjeant on the northern eyre circuit, challenging claims to franchises on behalf of the king and attempting to recover lands in the same cause. He managed to combine this with what was clearly an extensive private practice, not just in the same eyres but also (in between eyre sessions) in the common bench.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1284 Thornton was dispatched by the king to Ireland to act in <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings brought in the Dublin bench against Thomas Fitzmaurice relating to the shrievalties of the counties of Waterford, Cork, and Kerry, and in other proceedings in which the king was asserting his claim to the Decies and Desmond. He remained in Ireland until the summer of 1285. While in Dublin he also acted for the earl of Norfolk in litigation in the Dublin bench, and was well rewarded by the earl for his forensic success. The autumn of 1285 saw him resume his previous position as king's serjeant on the northern eyre circuit and also his extensive private practice, both on eyre and at Westminster. During the course of the Gloucestershire eyre of 1287 he was superseded as king's serjeant by the younger William Inge. Puzzlingly he also disappears from the reports of litigation heard in the common bench during 1288 and 1289, though he reappears acting for the king in a case heard there towards the end of Hilary term 1290. This can have been only just before his appointment as a justice of the court of king's bench, which had occurred before the end of that same term. When Ralph Hengham was disgraced, probably in late February 1290, Thornton succeeded him as chief justice of the court, and remained chief justice until his death, which took place in London on 28 August 1295.<br>
<br>The name of Thornton's wife is unknown and it seems likely that she had predeceased him. He may also have had an elder son who predeceased him, for his heir was his son Alan, who was in clerical orders and who in 1286 received permission from the archbishop of York to absent himself from his living of Rowley to study theology or canon law. The Gilbert of Thornton who succeeded Hengham in 1294 as rector of the Yorkshire living of Middleton in Pickeringlithe may have been another son. Thornton also had at least two daughters: Richilda, who was still alive in 1313 and claimed to be Alan's coheir, and another whose name is unknown but whose son, William Cateby, claimed to be Alan's other coheir.<br>
<br>Gilbert of Thornton may have been involved in the teaching of law. A <i>summa de casibus</i> which contains mainly brief notes on various points of law, and which apparently belongs to the period 1272&#150;5, survives in two Cambridge University Library manuscripts (Dd.7.14 and Ee.6.18) and in a manuscript now in the Carson collection of the Free Library of Philadelphia (LC 14.13). It probably derives from teaching, and its use of the names Gilbert of Thornton and Gilbert Buscy by way of example may well indicate that Gilbert was the teacher. It may also have been for didactic purposes that Gilbert prepared the epitome and partial updating of <span class="italic">De legibus et consuetudinibus Angliae</span>, formerly attributed to Henry of Bratton or Bracton (<i>d</i>. 1268), which is known to have been owned by his son Alan (Lincoln's Inn, Hale MS 135); he also prepared a revised (and still further abbreviated) version of the same epitome, one copy of which is now in Harvard law school and a second (but mutilated) copy of which was once owned by John Selden. This revised version must have been finished while he was chief justice of the king's bench, as it incorporates references to two of the legislative enactments of 1290 (<span class="italic">Quia emptores</span> and the <span class="roman">Statute of <i>Quo warranto</i></span>).<br>
