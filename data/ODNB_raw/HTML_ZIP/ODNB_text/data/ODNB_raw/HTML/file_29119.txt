<span class="headword">Weston,  Edward</span>  (1703&#150;1770), <span class="occ">government official and author</span>, was born at Eton, Buckinghamshire, on 3 January 1703, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29132/', "Stephen Weston (1665&#150;1742)")</script>, bishop of Exeter, and his wife, Lucy Sleech (<i>d</i>. 1742). He was educated at Eton College and at King's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1719 and graduated BA in 1723 and MA in 1727. Early in 1730 he married Penelope (<i>d</i>. 1754), the granddaughter of Bishop Patrick and the eldest daughter and coheir of the Revd Symon Patrick, of Dalham, Suffolk, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Fountayne, of Melton, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Upon leaving Cambridge, Weston obtained the post of tutor for the children of Charles, second Viscount Townshend, and in 1729 he was appointed Townshend's secretary when the latter became secretary of state for the north. When Townshend retired in the following year Weston became under-secretary to his successor, Lord Harrington, and he remained in that position until 1746. In November of that year Harrington went to Ireland as lord lieutenant and Weston accompanied him as chief secretary and privy councillor. He stayed in Ireland until 1751 and then, for reasons of health, went into retirement for ten years. He enjoyed a moderate income from several sinecures, including comptroller of the salt office, to which he had been appointed in 1728, and editor of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>, at a salary of &pound;500 per annum. He also acquired by purchase the parish of Somerby and much of the parish of Searby in Lincolnshire. Following the death of his wife, Penelope, in 1754, Weston married two years later Anne, the daughter of John Fountayne of Melton.<br>
<br>At Lord Bute's earnest request, Weston, &#145;a very able, worthy, good man&#146;, returned in March 1761 to his old post in the northern department. He was a diligent secretary, interested in enhancing departmental efficiency, and Bute valued his administrative expertise and relied on his authoritative grasp of European affairs. Following Bute's elevation to the Treasury, Weston served under his successor as northern secretary, George Grenville, and then, in October 1762, transferred to the southern department, headed by Lord Halifax. Despite intermittent bouts of ill health, he pursued his official functions until August 1763, when he accompanied Halifax upon the latter's move to the northern department. There he again occupied a vital position, drafting and modifying state papers and preparing commissions and warrants, including the general warrant against Wilkes and others connected with the <span class="italic">North Briton</span> affair. Weston was also a clerk of the signet, and was allowed to perform his duties by deputy. In August 1762 he received a grant for thirty-one years of the office of alnager in Ireland, but resigned it a year later, on receiving a pension of &pound;500 per annum for the same period. On 1 September 1763 he was appointed one of the commissioners to execute the office of privy seal.<br>
<br>Unremitting ill health finally forced Weston to retire in April 1764. A yearly pension of &pound;750 was granted to him for his valuable services. He continued to provide informal advice and guidance on diplomatic matters over the next few years, but he declined to resume office when asked by Grafton in July 1765. He remained in retirement, pursuing classical studies, writing pamphlets and sermons, and contributions to the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>. Among the various pamphlets attributed to him, only two can be definitely identified as his: <span class="italic">The Englishman Directed in the Choice of his Religion</span> (4th edn, 1767) and <span class="italic">Family Discourses by a Country Gentleman</span> (1768). He also wrote an answer to Bishop Warburton, and the long epitaph in Fulham churchyard on Bishop Sherlock was composed by him. He died at Buxton, Derbyshire, on 15 July 1770, and was buried on 17 July at Somerby, Lincolnshire, where a monument records his memory.<br>
