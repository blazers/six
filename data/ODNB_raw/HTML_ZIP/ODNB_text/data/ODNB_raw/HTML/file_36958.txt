<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  Herbert Wrigley</span>  (1866&#150;1940), <span class="occ">writer and journalist</span>, was born on 25 October 1866 at Linthwaite, near Huddersfield, Yorkshire, the eldest son of the eleven children of the vicar of Linthwaite, George Edwin Wilson, and his wife, Cecilia Wrigley. He was educated at Durham School and at Trinity College, Oxford. He graduated with first-class honours in classical moderations (1887), and second-class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1889).<br>
<br>Of a mild, retiring, unassuming character, Wilson combined a scholarly disposition with a prodigious capacity for work. He possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge and enthusiasm for the navy, and this was reflected in the first major book he published, <span class="italic">Ironclads in Action</span> (1896). This two-volume study, in its many different editions and surviving a change of title to <span class="italic">Battleships in Action</span>, for more than thirty years remained a standard work of reference. With Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, he wrote <span class="italic">Nelson and his Times</span> (1898). He also contributed a substantial share to Sir William Laird Clowes's history, <span class="italic">The Royal Navy</span> (1897&#150;1903), and several chapters on naval subjects to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span>. All Wilson's naval writings were designed to promote public awareness of the need to maintain British naval supremacy. He was a founder member of the Navy League, and the honorary editor of its <span class="italic">Journal</span> (1895&#150;1908). Wilson's capacities as a military commentator were demonstrated in his perceptive and deservedly popular two-volume history of the South African War, <span class="italic">With the Flag to Pretoria</span> (1900&#150;01).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Wilson had begun a successful career as a journalist, contributing leading articles on military and naval topics and foreign affairs to <span class="italic">The Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Standard</span>. Most significantly, he caught the attention and became the friend of Alfred Harmsworth (later Viscount Northcliffe). Shortly after the launch of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, Wilson was appointed its chief leader writer and assistant editor, posts that he held for the remainder of his life. Wilson revelled in this new venture in popular journalism, fondly recalling in later years, &#145;those days of youth, full of romance, which live in the memory of all who shared those early triumphs&#146;  (Pound and Harmsworth, 218).<br>
<br>Both Northcliffe and his brother Rothermere, for all their generosity, were not always easy taskmasters. Technically, Wilson was responsible to his editor, Thomas Marlowe, but the newspaper's proprietor was the ultimate arbiter. Whatever his true feelings, whenever Northcliffe or later Rothermere commanded, Wilson acquiesced. Yet Wilson was always eager to defend Northcliffe against any critic who claimed the proprietor interfered too much in editorial matters. &#145;Alfred&#146;, he assured Leo Maxse, &#145;is often attacked and blamed unfairly &hellip; A newspaper proprietor has difficulties which critics overlook&#146;  (Wilson to Maxse, 22 July 1911, Maxse MSS). Wilson's unfailing, admiring loyalty was rewarded in 1916 when he was appointed to the board of Associated Newspapers. His resignation in 1920 was accompanied with a characteristic affirmation of attachment to Northcliffe. &#145;Who could help being devoted to you? Who cannot but be proud to serve under you?&#146;  (Wilson to Northcliffe, 2 Jan 1920, Northcliffe MSS). The words were inspired by affection not sycophancy. In 1926, when the editor, Thomas Marlowe, and the managing director, Sir Andrew Caird, resigned from the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> because they were unable any longer to tolerate Rothermere's attachment either to Lloyd George or Beaverbrook, Wilson, who had been reappointed a director in 1925 and shared Marlowe's and Caird's disapprobation, chose to stay. He was determined to do what he might to guide Rothermere's wayward steps back into the official tory fold. Wilson remained a director of Associated Newspapers until 1939.<br>
<br>Joseph Chamberlain was the first prominent politician to cultivate Wilson's friendship as a useful ally. With his brother, J. B. Wilson, and R. D. Blumenfeld, Wilson was recruited to persuade Sir Arthur Pearson, then owner of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, to accept the chairmanship of the Tariff Reform League. As Northcliffe's confidant and adviser, Wilson frequently tempered the proprietor's over-enthusiastic, rumbustious involvement in party political matters. He served the interests of the Unionists well, exercising an important influence in the reform of the party's electoral machinery in 1910.<br>
<br>With his easy and privileged access to Unionist politicians and senior service personnel, Wilson was kept exceptionally well informed. Though a friend of Beresford, his attack on Admiral Fisher's inadequacies as a strategist was entirely justified. Later censures of the first sea lord, who denounced Wilson as an &#145;idiot&#146; and &#145;eunuch&#146;  (A. J. Marder, ed. <span class="italic">Years of Power, 1904&#150;14</span>, vol. 2 of <span class="italic">Fear God and Dread Nought</span>, 1956, 86 and 244), were silenced by his editor on Northcliffe's instructions. Northcliffe fully shared Wilson's fearful apprehension concerning Germany's ambitions. He applauded Wilson's campaign of &#145;Two Keels for one&#146; begun in the <span class="italic">National Review</span>, backed up by the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. Wilson constantly insisted, &#145;that the supremacy of our fleet &hellip; must be regarded as a permanent feature of our national policy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, 29 July 1910). But Wilson was never a wild scaremonger about the threat Germany posed to Britain. In August 1911 he refused to join the chorus warning of imminent war. He was convinced that Germany would strike only when her deficit in modern battleships had been repaired. He did, however, ally himself with the radical tories in their unreasoned opposition to R. B. Haldane and the army reforms he promoted. And he was angry with Ralph Lane (Norman Angell) for writing his admired and influential pacifist polemic, <span class="italic">Europe's Optical Illusion</span> (1909). This was not so much because he supposed its message to be fundamentally flawed as that he considered it an act of apostasy to have been written by an employee of Northcliffe's.<br>
<br>Wilson, who never married, died at his home, Birchfield, 18 Verulam Road, Hitchin, on 12 July 1940. He was buried in Hitchin cemetery on 15 July. For more than forty years his signed articles and leaders in the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, written with &#145;admirable style and balanced judgment&#146;, had contributed &#145;much to build up the prestige&#146; of his newspaper &#145;with the best type of reader&#146;  (Ward-Price, 74). Sir John Hammerton, Wilson's colleague and co-editor on a number of serial publications, considered Wilson to be undoubtedly the best scholar among contemporary journalists (see J. A. Hammerton, <span class="italic">Books and Myself</span>, n.d., 260). Thomas Marlowe, for almost thirty years Wilson's editor, with neither condescension nor irony, acknowledged to Northcliffe that it was Wilson who was &#145;the brains of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>&#146;  (Marlowe, n.d., Northcliffe MSS). Colleagues at Carmelite House all acknowledged and admired Wilson's unfailing generosity and kindliness of spirit. The memoir in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> by his brother, J. B. Wilson, is of particular interest and importance as a source.<br>
