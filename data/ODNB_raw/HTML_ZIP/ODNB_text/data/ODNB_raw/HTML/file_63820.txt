<span class="headword">Lucas,  Norman Bernard Charles</span>  (1901&#150;1980), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 2 January 1901 at 3 Salisbury Terrace, Craven Road, Newbury, Berkshire, the son of Allan Lucas, solicitor, and his wife, Norah Eveline Brooks. Lucas's troubled experiences as a child had a significant influence on his work as a teacher. At the age of three he was boarded out, but rejoined his parents aged six, when his father's business difficulties led to the removal of the family to Winnipeg, Canada. Here his parents' marriage broke up and he was eventually sent back to an aunt in England. By his ninth birthday he had been transferred to his tenth home, that of his maternal grandparents in a village near Newbury. In 1912 he gained a scholarship to Newbury grammar school but had to leave at fifteen to work for his grandfather as a baker's roundsman. A year or so later in Newbury he happened to meet his headmaster, who asked him home and offered him a place at his own expense in the sixth form as a boarder from September 1917. Four terms later Lucas won an open scholarship in history at Cambridge. One significant consequence of this was that as headmaster of Midhurst grammar school many years later he took on as boarders at his personal expense some able boys who needed the support of a boarding education to achieve their potential, including, at one stage, some from Germany and Austria threatened with persecution by the Nazi regime.<br>
<br>In 1919 Lucas went up to Emmanuel College, Cambridge; he graduated in 1922 with a first-class degree. He taught in France and Egypt for three years. On returning to Britain he taught from 1925 at Rendcombe College in Cirencester, an experimental boarding-school, whose headmaster, J. H. Simpson, had been greatly influenced by the ideas of Homer Lane. Simpson's main aim was to enable pupils to combine acceptance of authority with much freedom and a considerable degree of self-government, and within this framework to achieve a high academic standard. Lucas believed that it was here that he learned much of the art of headmastership which he later put into practice at Midhurst. In 1927 he moved to London and taught at Highgate School for three years before undertaking research in France, with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation, on the thought of Georges Sorel. He returned to England in 1933 to teach history at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, and on 2 August 1934 he married Vera Agnes Douglas (1908&#150;1971), whom he had met when both were engaged on research in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris. She had read modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford, taken a first-class degree, and then held successively the Zaharoff travelling fellowship and the Esmond senior scholarship, before becoming a schoolteacher.<br>
<br>Lucas was appointed headmaster of Midhurst grammar school in 1938. No new staff had been appointed there since 1927 and the number of pupils had declined to about 150. The boarders and most day boys were fee payers; a fifth held free places. The current level of achievement was such that the county education authority would give no guarantee that it would continue to support the school. Sixth-form work was virtually non-existent. The most urgent task facing Lucas was to see that far more attention was given to study and achievement. The first group of sixth formers under the new arrangements consisted of seven boys, six of whom got open awards at Oxford and Cambridge. During a period of twenty-five years the sixth form increased from 7 to over 130. The outbreak of war in 1939 led to the evacuation to Midhurst of a London girls' grammar school, which meant that the main school buildings had to be shared. This facilitated radical change in that for half of each day pupils had to use the large boarding-house, where less formal group teaching, clubs, and discussion groups were organized, and fuller use was made of the extensive playing fields. Weekly meetings of boys to deal with school matters in the boarding-house were used to accustom pupils to a considerable degree of self-government.<br>
<br>Within a few years the school became a community based on mutual respect in which pupils, including those with emotional or social disabilities, were enabled to develop independent personalities so that they could accept with assurance and sensitivity their place in the community, be it school, place of employment, or society generally. Under Lucas's guidance Midhurst grammar school became co-educational in 1956 to help overcome the shortage of places for girls in the area. A girls' boarding-house was built to balance the boys' house while preserving the value that Lucas saw in a part boarding, part day school. Ten years later there was further change when the school became comprehensive. Lucas was asked to stay for a further year beyond retirement age to see through the fusion of the county secondary school with the grammar school voluntary-controlled foundation. Throughout the three decades of Lucas's headmastership his wife, through both her ideas and her teaching (she was head of the modern languages department from 1939 and senior mistress when the school went co-educational), made a vital contribution to the school.<br>
<br>In 1967 Lucas retired to Haslemere, Surrey. In 1972, the year after Vera Lucas's death, he married on 25 July Doreen Mary Bassett (1913&#150;1995), who had worked at the school as secretary and later caterer for a quarter of a century. In retirement he wrote <span class="italic">An Experience of Teaching</span> (1975), in which he set out many of his ideas and described his work in a unique and outstandingly successful school community. Lucas died at his home, Coombe Cottage, Grayswood Road, Haslemere, Surrey, on 12 July 1980, of coronary thrombosis.<br>
