<span class="headword">Pearson, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1782&#150;1847), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of the Revd Thomas Horner Pearson (1752&#150;1832), rector of Podimore, Milton, and vicar of Queen Camel, Somerset, and his wife, Temperance. Two younger brothers, Charles (1789&#150;1864) and George (1792&#150;1816), distinguished themselves as officers in the Royal Navy. On 2 October 1796 Pearson was commissioned into the 23rd foot (Royal Welch Fusiliers), joining that &eacute;lite but skeleton regiment at Chatham. He was present, but not landed, for the failed raid on the Ostend lock gates in May 1798.<br>
<br>Promoted first lieutenant on 25 April 1799, Pearson was first in hard infantry combat at the Netherlands (Helder) assault landings on 27 August, and twice more, at Egmont and Castricum, in that campaign. While on the Ferrol expedition, before landing against that Spanish naval base, he was promoted captain on 7 August 1800. The 23rd joined Sir Ralph Abercromby in the Mediterranean to expel the French from Egypt. After landing in Abu Qir Bay on 8 March 1801 Pearson was severely wounded in the thigh, but fought with his company for the whole campaign, and was awarded the sultan's gold order of the Crescent.<br>
<br>After nine months at Gibraltar, Pearson obtained his first home leave (six months) from the duke of Kent. He rejoined the 23rd in the Isle of Wight (1803&#150;4). In December 1804 Pearson's recruiting earned him a majority in the newly formed 2nd battalion at Chester. Over 400 strong, it was inspected there under his command on 5 December 1806. Pearson and 257 men rejoined the 1st battalion at Colchester (February 1807). On 17 August Pearson led the 23rd's advance guard in the first skirmishing of the Copenhagen campaign and was almost daily in action until the city surrendered three weeks later.<br>
<br>The highlight of Pearson's 1808&#150;10 posting to Nova Scotia was the expedition to capture Martinique. On 1 February 1809 he commanded the regiment's left wing in a seven-hour battle with the French. His &#145;spirited and judicious exertions&#146;  (Philippart, 2.35) were noted by Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost on the 2nd, when Pearson took command of Prevost's division's light infantry battalion. Before Fort Desaix surrendered, Pearson was wounded by grapeshot in his leg. He was thanked for surprising a French picket. After returning to Nova Scotia, Pearson married Ann Eliza Coffin (1789&#150;1859) the second daughter of the American loyalist Lieutenant-General John Coffin (<i>c</i>.1751&#150;1838), on 28 June 1810, at Coffin's Alwington Manor, near Saint John, New Brunswick.<br>
<br>By November 1810 Pearson had sailed to Lisbon with the fusilier brigade (7th and 23rd foot) to enter the Peninsular War. Pearson led its light battalion in Wellington's March 1811 pursuit of the French from Portugal, then turned south as part of 4th division towards Badajoz. At Olivenza the fire of Pearson's fusiliers and riflemen kept the besiegers' losses to a minimum. On the bloody day of Albuera (16 May 1811) Pearson commanded 4th division's ten light infantry companies as a right-flank hollow square against the French cavalry. This enabled the fusilier brigade to make its epic attack undisturbed. As the senior unwounded officer Pearson temporarily commanded that victorious but literally halved formation. A lieutenant-colonel from 30 May 1811, Pearson reverted to commanding the fusilier light companies. In a 27 September rearguard action at Aldea da Ponte, Spain, they twice helped retake the village, but their commander incurred a shattered thigh bone which caused his evacuation to Lisbon and England.<br>
<br>Recovered, Pearson became an inspecting field officer of militia in Canada on 28 February 1812. Bound for Quebec from Halifax in July or August aboard the schooner <i>Mary Ann</i> he, his wife and baby son were captured by the US Salem privateer <i>Buckskin</i> but were recaptured by the frigate HMS <i>Maidstone</i>. From late October he commanded at Prescott, a hamlet and battery (later Fort Wellington) on the vital St Lawrence River route to Kingston.<br>
<br>Surgeon William Dunlop recalled Pearson as &#145;as good a man, and as brave a soldier as ever drew a sword, but too much of a martinet to be favourite with the militia&#146;  (Dunlop, 27). Lieutenant Le Couteur relates how a militiaman seeking leave was told &#145;&#147;Go to Hell!&#148;&#146; The man persisted, &#145;&#147;Has your honour any orders for the Devil?&#148; Pearson &hellip; smiled: &#147;What leave do you want?&#148; &#147;Six days!!!&#148; He doubled his leave and gave him a pound to take home!&#146;  (<span class="italic">War of 1812 Journal</span>, 113).<br>
<br>On 9 November 1813 Pearson's 440 regulars, militia, and three 6-pounders at Prescott joined a 680-strong British-Canadian force pursuing over 7000 American troops advancing on Montreal. At the classic &#145;thin red line&#146; victory of Crysler's Farm on 11 November, when Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Morrison's second in command, he added a clasp to his army gold medal for Albuera and lost a horse. He was made a CB in January 1814.<br>
<br>At the request of Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond, Pearson sailed to Fort George in April 1814 via Oswego to command a light brigade under Major-General Phineas Riall on the Niagara frontier. At the Chippawa River (3&#150;5, 8 July), at Lundy's Lane near Niagara Falls (25 July, wounded in the arm), and in the siege of Fort Erie (until 17 September) Pearson displayed outstanding leadership of all-arms forces numbering up to 1100 regulars, militia, and Indians. By the time an American rifle bullet in the head put Pearson <i>hors de combat</i> (and destroyed the hearing of his right ear), Drummond's right division had fought the most formidable American army encountered to a tactical draw and a strategic victory.<br>
<br>After the wars Pearson briefly commanded 2nd battalion, 43rd light infantry, before disbandment. In July 1817 he took command of his former regiment, the 23rd, then in France, for thirteen years, serving in Ireland (1818&#150;23) and Gibraltar (until 1827&#150;8).<br>
<br>Pearson became major-general on 22 July 1830, leaving his beloved fusiliers. Knighted by William IV on 18 March 1835 he was made KCH that year. His son was Captain Thomas Aylmer Pearson (also of the 43rd), aide-de-camp to the general officer commanding northern district of Ireland, in which command his father became lieutenant-general on 23 November 1841. Pearson received the colonelcy of the 85th light infantry on 21 November 1843. Following erysipelas for six days, he died at 1 Edgar Buildings, Lansdown, Bath, on 21 May 1847.<br>
