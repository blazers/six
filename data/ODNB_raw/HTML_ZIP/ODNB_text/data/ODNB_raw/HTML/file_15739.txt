<span class="headword">Knight,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1615/16), <span class="occ">clergyman and religious writer</span>, was probably born at Arlington, Sussex. He was probably the man who matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, in November 1575, graduated BA in 1580, and was ordained as a priest in the diocese of Peterborough on 5 September 1583. In 1591 he was admitted as rector of Arlington. Knight became a radical puritan. On 30 April 1605 he was one of ten Sussex preachers deprived for persistent nonconformity by Anthony Watson, bishop of Chichester, and a William Smith was instituted to the vicarage. However, within five years Knight became reconciled to the Church of England. About 1596 he had begun a long work, which he issued in 1610 as <span class="italic">A Concordance Axiomaticall, Containing a Survey of Theological Propositions</span>. In his prefatory remarks the author criticized himself and other ministers in the area for their earlier tendency &#145;to minister occasions of discontentment to others&#146; and for &#145;taking pleasure in rash invectives or calumniations against things established by order among us&#146;, recommending that they earn &#145;contentment to ourselves, according to these rules to preach Jesus Christ &hellip; labouring to establish in the hearts of our people, the grounds of faith, and the blessed practise of obedience&#146;. This work is signed from Arlington, Sussex, on 20 July 1610, but if Knight had gained readmission to a benefice locally the fact is not recorded. He may perhaps have held a curacy and lived in the house of his upbringing. Knight died, at Arlington, between signing his will on 20 October 1615 and the grant of probate on 30 March 1616.<br>
<br>A second William Knight (<i>d</i>. 1623), Church of England clergyman, from Derbyshire, may perhaps have been baptized at Egginton, in that county on 20 January 1563. He too attended Christ's College, Cambridge, matriculating as a pensioner in July 1579, graduating BA in 1583 and proceeding MA in 1586. He was admitted as a fellow of the college in 1583, was active on college business from 1586 at its properties in Nottinghamshire, and later in Leicestershire, and was appointed dean in 1588. Following his marriage to Agnes Hobson at Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire, on 11 June 1595, Knight resigned his fellowship. On 19 April 1598, after the death of Thomas Willet, and on the presentation of Edward Francklin, clerk, he was instituted to the rectory of Barley, Hertfordshire. On 29 January 1599 he was succeeded there by Thomas's famous son Andrew Willet (1562&#150;1621), who resigned his own rectory of Little Grandsen, Cambridgeshire, in favour of Knight. The two men had been contemporaries at Christ's, and Willet wrote of Knight that he was &#145;vir probens, prudens, doctus, mihique amicissimus&#146; (&#145;a man of honesty, prudence, learning, and a very good friend to me&#146;; <span class="italic">Harmony on I Samuel 1</span>, foreword). The demesne lands of Little Gransden had been used to support the heads of Cambridge colleges, and Knight is reported to have been involved in negotiations with parishioners over these impositions. He died in 1573 and was buried at Little Gransden on 25 November.<br>
<br>A third William Knight (<i>c</i>.1573&#150;1617?), Church of England clergyman and translator, matriculated as a sizar from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1593, graduating BA in 1596. He proceeded MA in 1599 and was incorporated in that degree at Oxford on 12 July 1603. The following year Knight was presented to the rectory of Hinderclay in the diocese of Norwich but, it seems, he was actually instituted to another Suffolk rectory, Culford, on 7 August 1604. He was there in 1612, at which time the rights of presentation were held by Sir Nathaniel Bacon of Stiffkey. It is likely that this was the William Knight who had translated <span class="italic">Mundus alter et idem sive terrar Australis</span> by Joseph Hall (1574&#150;1656), later bishop of Exeter and then of Norwich, and who in 1609 confided to Hall his doubts as to his own fitness for the ministry. Hall replied that he was &#145;sorry to hear of your discontentment&#146; but that &#145;the cause is from yourself&#146;, stressing that divinity was a hard but rewarding taskmaster, and adding that &#145;We scholars are aptest of all others to make ourselves miserable&#146;  (Hall, 3.115&#150;16). Nothing more is certainly known of this man, but in April 1617 a clergyman of his name fell seriously ill and died a week later at Puriton near Bridgwater, Somerset. In a nuncupative will proved on 19 December 1617 he left all his property to his wife, Mabel.<br>
