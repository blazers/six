<span class="headword">Burgess,  Henry</span>  (1781&#150;1863), <span class="occ">financial journalist and businessman</span>, was born on 7 July 1781 at Grooby Lodge, Railby, Leicestershire, the seventh of the eleven children of Joseph Burgess (1735&#150;1807), farmer and grazier, and Sarah, daughter of Joseph and Sarah Airey of Strickland, Kirby Kendal, Westmorland. Brought up within the Society of Friends, he attended George Blaxland's school at Hitchin, Hertfordshire. Little is known about his early career, save that he visited Paris in 1803, and by about 1805 had married (outside the society) Frances Ridsdale (1784&#150;1847). They had four sons.<br>
<br>Burgess became a cloth merchant in London during the wars against France, but in 1819 he sought to establish a new national postal service. Despite some governmental support, he faced mounting parliamentary opposition and was forced to discontinue his scheme, which left him with a hefty claim for compensation against the Treasury. In 1822 Burgess patented a lightweight coach&#151;a residue of this project&#151;and was also licensed to build ships on William Annesley's principles. By 1826 he had returned to the woollen trade, this time in Leeds. Described as &#145;intimately connected with manufacturing and banking concerns&#146; in the north of England, he also became one of the most forceful opponents of government economic policy. An early critic (as H. B.) of the resumption of cash payments in 1819 (effectively, a return to the gold standard), he contributed useful evidence to the 1826 committee on promissory notes, emphasizing the importance of bills of exchange in currency management. He did so primarily from the viewpoint of the country bankers suffering from the &#145;evils&#146; of the return to cash payments, which Burgess believed harmed the productive classes of provincial England while benefiting the rentier classes of London. In 1827 he had established offices at 81 Lombard Street on behalf of the country bankers and set up, with himself as editor, the <span class="italic">Bankers' Circular</span>, in order to give them a more effective voice in the making of government policy. At this point Burgess, a tory by predilection, found himself in growing sympathy with Sir James Graham and the more &#145;liberal whigs&#146;, and the <span class="italic">Circular to Bankers</span> (as his journal became in September 1828) was to support the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1831&#150;2. His services to the whigs over reform did not receive the recognition he sought (the secretaryship to the factory commission or to the West Indian loan commission). Instead, Burgess became the secretary to the Country Bankers' Committee, giving evidence to the select committee on banking in 1832 and defending the country banks' interests on the renewal of the Bank of England's charter in 1833. With early losses on the <span class="italic">Circular</span> underwritten by the Quaker bankers Backhouse and Pease, he sought to widen its readership by a lower subscription in 1835, and thereafter it generally gave him an income of &pound;1000 p.a. In common with Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham school, he staunchly promoted the interdependent interests of the country gentry, their bankers, and the provincial manufacturing interest against the injuries inflicted by an economic policy dominated by the financial interests of the Bank of England and its allies, the whigs.<br>
<br>But Burgess was to be no more a friend to the tories after 1841, for Peel's economic policies since 1819 had been anathema to him. As a result the <span class="italic">Circular</span> became in many ways the most effective and stringent critic of the <span class="roman">Bank Charter Act</span> in 1844 and of the repeal of the corn laws in 1846. Burgess, &#145;incorrigible&#146; in his &#145;commercial heresies&#146;  (Porter to Burgess, 25 April 1846, Burgess papers), was a key figure supplying information on which the protectionists, above all Lord George Bentinck, sought to build their alternative economic policy. &#145;Few men&#146;, the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> puffed, &#145;have rendered so great services to the cause of British productive industry&#146;  (20 July 1846). Burgess helped Bentinck to mastermind the select committee on the commercial crisis of 1847, a crisis he saw as the logical outcome of the misguided monetary policies of Peel's government. Disillusioned with free trade and banking policy, he retired as editor of the <span class="italic">Circular</span> in July 1850. He had completed single-handed all but two of its issues, in effect 1180 economic tracts for the times, one of which he enlarged into <span class="italic">Reflections on the Designs and Possible Consequences of the Anti-Corn Law League</span> (1843). Although partly a vehicle for Burgess's own crotchets, the <span class="italic">Circular</span> also provided a genuine voice for the concerns of the country banking interest, and, in its combination of financial data and editorial opinion, set a precedent for journals such as <span class="italic">The Economist</span>. It has proved a considerable resource for economic historians, for example R. C. O. Matthews  (<span class="italic">A Study in Trade Cycle History</span>, 1954), although it has been unaccountably neglected by historians of protectionist politics in the 1840s.<br>
<br>Burgess, never simply a financial journalist, also engaged in a variety of speculative ventures. In the early 1830s, for example, he had sought, with two of his sons, to pioneer trade with Persia. This proved ill-fated, for the elder son absconded in the 1830s with large debts, leaving the younger Charles in effect a permanent hostage. His father's tireless efforts eventually secured his release in 1855, only for him to die before leaving Persian territory. The youngest son, George, however, did successfully make his career as a merchant in New York. Burgess's personal misfortunes were compounded by estrangement from his wife in the early 1840s and by her death in 1847. Nor were his business ventures any more successful, despite his persuading Barings, the City's leading merchant bank, to join Charles Attwood and himself in setting up the Weardale Iron Company in 1845. This led to the building of the &#145;new&#146; town of Tow Law in co. Durham but proved a failure in the short term, and Burgess sold his share in 1848. He then turned his hand to a variety of mineral speculations, importing in 1848 the white ore from Germany that played an important part in Robert Mushet's early development of steel. After retiring from the <span class="italic">Circular</span>, he redoubled his speculative efforts, buying and selling mines and shares, mostly in northern England, the Forest of Dean, and Cornwall. None of these proved lucrative, and by the early 1860s Burgess, then in extremely poor health, was forced to sell up his personal possessions for &pound;120. He died on 6 June 1863 at his home, 29 St Swithin's Lane, London, and was buried at Winchmore Hill, Middlesex.<br>
