<span class="headword">Ellerman, Sir  John Reeves</span>, second baronet  (1909&#150;1973), <span class="occ">shipowner and naturalist</span>, was born at 5A Earls Avenue, Folkestone, Kent, on 21 December 1909, the only son and second child (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31067/', "Winifred Ellerman")</script> was the eldest child) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32995/', "Sir John Reeves Ellerman, first baronet (1862&#150;1933)")</script>, the immensely wealthy shipowner and financier (probably Britain's richest ever businessman), and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glover (<i>d</i>. 1939). At the time of Ellerman's birth, the first Sir John Ellerman was already forty-seven; his son was therefore likely to succeed to the vast Ellerman fortune at a comparatively early age. Ellerman was educated at St Bede's preparatory school at Eastbourne and spent two years at Malvern College, before finishing his education in Switzerland. Although highly intelligent and industrious, with a rapidly growing interest in natural history, he did not attend a university but read for the bar at the Inner Temple and then was taken into the family shipping business at its Moorgate headquarters.<br>
<br>In July 1933 his father died suddenly, and Ellerman found himself, at the age of twenty-three, a baronet and the heir to a fortune, after death duties, of over &pound;20 million. On 21 August, only a month after his father's death, he married Esther de Sola (<i>d</i>. 1984), of a prominent Montreal Jewish family, whose brother was a close friend in London. With his wife Ellerman shared a keen interest in amateur dramatics and Gilbert and Sullivan, and Lady Ellerman was a close companion to him until his death. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>The first Sir John had built up over a long period a competent group of managers and lieutenants who ran Ellerman Lines, and the management style of the firm was based upon sound conservative principles, a product of both the proven success of this approach and the difficulties of innovation during the depression. Observers who worked with the younger Ellerman regarded him as a sound and sensible businessman. Although lacking his father's financial genius, he was a competent manager without any penchant for personal dissipation or foolish extravagance. After the Second World War, and particularly after the mid-1950s, Ellerman Lines modernized in a deliberate and rational way, placing emphasis on new shipping routes in Australia, east Asia, the United States, and the Middle East. In the mid-1960s Ellerman Lines became one of the first British shipping companies to introduce containerization, purchasing several of the earliest container vessels in Britain. Ellerman proved to be an active chairman, although the day-to-day running of the firm remained in the hands of its managerial staff.<br>
<br>Although extremely capable, Ellerman had little real interest in business life. From the mid-1930s he became, instead, an internationally noted student of natural history, especially of the rodent family. Between 1940 and 1961 he published five scholarly monographs and seventeen learned articles or notes on these subjects, most significantly a three-volume, 1500 page monograph on <span class="italic">Families and Genera of Living Rodents</span>, published by the British Museum (Natural History) in 1940&#150;49. Just as his father was at home in the business world, so the younger Ellerman was renowned for his extraordinary memory and wide-ranging knowledge of natural history. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of South Africa and was also an honorary associate of the department of zoology of the British Museum (Natural History), where he spent much of his time, and was well known around the world as an eminent authority.<br>
<br>For a man so blameless and retiring, Ellerman attracted a remarkable amount of press commentary, especially from the Beaverbrook press, apparently resulting from an old grudge held by the press lord against his father. He was often the subject of expos&eacute;s in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. Like his father, he became an active investor in the British press, in part so that he could diminish publicity of this sort. In the 1930s he owned a major share of the Odhams Press and in the early 1950s he was among the largest shareholders in the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>. He was a close friend of Lord Southwood, Odham's proprietor.<br>
<br>During his lifetime, Ellerman was generally regarded as Britain's richest man. During the closing years of his life estimates of his fortune ranged from &pound;125 million to &pound;500 million. The latter figure was given in several editions of the <span class="italic">Guinness Book of Records</span> in its entry for England's richest man. Like his father, he had a passion for privacy which was taken to extremes. He was rarely photographed and played no part in public life. He eschewed the typical lifestyle of the very rich. He divided his time between a house in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, a suite he permanently maintained at the Dorchester Hotel, London, and frequent trips to South Africa. He helped many refugees to escape from Nazi Germany and was attacked by name by William Joyce, &#145;Lord Haw-Haw&#146;, in several of his broadcasts, under the mistaken but widely held belief that Ellerman, as well as his wife, was of Jewish descent. In the course of his lifetime he anonymously gave very large sums to charity, especially to assist wounded war veterans and disabled persons. In appearance (in contrast to his father) he was a tall, thin man of distinguished looks.<br>
<br>Ellerman died suddenly of a heart attack on 17 July 1973, in the Dorchester Hotel, London, shortly after returning from a holiday in southern France. He was later cremated. He left over &pound;52 million, the largest estate ever left by a Briton, and the biggest fortune since his father's death forty years before. As he had no children and groomed no relatives as heirs, his shares in the family firm were reorganized into a charitable trust shortly before his death. He did not begin to rival the perhaps unique standards of business ability set by his father, but proved&#151;unlike so many with ample means to satisfy every temptation&#151;to be a decent and constructive human being.<br>
