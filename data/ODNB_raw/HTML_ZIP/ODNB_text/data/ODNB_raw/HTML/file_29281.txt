<span class="headword">Whitefield,  George</span>  (1714&#150;1770), <span class="occ">Calvinistic Methodist leader</span>, was born on 16 December 1714 at The Bell inn, Southgate Street, Gloucester, the youngest of the six sons and one daughter of Thomas Whitefield (<i>bap</i>. 1681, <i>d</i>. 1716), proprietor of the inn, and his wife, Elizabeth (1681?&#150;1751), daughter of Richard Edwards and his wife, Mary, both of Bristol.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>George Whitefield (pronounced Whitfield) was baptized at the church of St Mary de Crypt, Gloucester, on 25 December 1714. When he was aged two his father died, and in 1722 his mother married Capel Longden, &#145;an unhappy match&#146;  (<span class="italic">George Whitefield's Journals</span>, 39). Whitefield was enrolled in Gloucester Cathedral school, aged eleven. A year later he entered St Mary de Crypt School, priding himself on his elocution, memory, and speech making. Devoted to reading plays and to acting, he often dressed and performed the part of a woman. Through his stepfather's mismanagement The Bell fell into hard times, and after a year or so Whitefield left school to assist with menial tasks. By the late 1720s his mother had separated from Longden and moved from The Bell. At about the age of four Whitefield had contracted measles, the cause of his lifelong squint. Mercilessly teased, on one occasion he repeated the words of the psalm: &#145;But in the Name of the Lord will I destroy them.&#146; He liked &#145;to imitate the ministers reading prayers&#146; and even composed sermons  (ibid., 38). He re-entered St Mary de Crypt School, and received his first communion on 25 December 1731.<br>
<br>On 7 November 1732 Whitefield matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford. As a servitor, the lowest rank of undergraduates, he performed servile tasks, which continued throughout his Oxford years. Through Charles Wesley, in the summer of 1733 he joined a group practising self-denial, lengthy devotions, and meticulous self-examination. This &#145;Holy Club&#146; of &#145;despised Methodists&#146; was led by John Wesley  (<span class="italic">George Whitefield's Journals</span>, 46). &#145;Whole days and weeks&#146; were &#145;spent in lying prostrate on the ground&#146;, and Whitefield ate &#145;the worst sort of food&#146;  (ibid., 52&#150;3), neglected his appearance, and became obsessed with the devil. Seriously ill following a severe 1735 Lenten fast (when he experienced his inner conversion), Whitefield recuperated in Gloucester. He returned to Oxford in March 1736 and assumed the leadership of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96375', "Holy Club")</script>, the Wesleys having departed for Georgia. He faced his examination on 14 May and received his BA two months later.<h2>
<a name="Earlyministry"></a>Early ministry</h2>&#145;Fully persuaded it is His will that I should take Orders&#146;  (Whitefield, diary, BL, Add. MS 34068), Whitefield was ordained deacon on 20 June 1736 in Gloucester Cathedral by Bishop Martin Benson. The following Sunday he preached his first sermon, in St Mary de Crypt. The next month he covered pastoral duties at the Tower of London and walked through the streets in his gown and cassock, with people crying out, &#145;There's a boy parson&#146;  (<span class="italic">George Whitefield's Journals</span>, 77). His first London sermon was at St Botolph without Bishopsgate, on 8 August, and for two months he preached at the Tower on the theme of the new birth. By this Whitefield meant a total change of heart, an inner regeneration wrought solely by the action of the Holy Spirit. This experience, in no way dependent upon traditional religious observance, would result in a faith vitally felt. During November and December he officiated at Dummer, Hampshire. He had corresponded with the Wesleys and late in 1736 determined to follow them to Georgia. In the spring he deputized for the vicar of Stonehouse, Gloucestershire. Most of 1737 was devoted to preaching charity sermons for Georgia, especially in Bristol and Bath, then in London for four months from late August; Whitefield generally preached nine times a week and wrote that he was forced from foot to coach in order &#145;to avoid the hosannas of the multitude&#146;  (ibid., 89). During this period he collected &pound;1000 for English charity schools and &pound;300 for Georgia. The effectiveness of these collections induced most parish clergymen &#145;to open their pulpits to him, which otherwise they were unwilling to do&#146;  (Hutton, 183). However, these sermons were not charitable towards them. In his first publication&#151;his subsequently most widely distributed sermon, <span class="italic">The Nature and Necessity of our New Birth in Christ Jesus, in Order to Salvation</span> (1737)&#151;he castigated fellow clerics for presenting only &#145;the shell and shadow of religion&#146;  (Tyerman, 1.81). He unequivocally maintained that anyone who did not accept the necessity of a new birth would be &#145;thrust down into Hell&#146;  (Thomas, 26.384). This theme remained central.<br>
<br>Whitefield sailed for Georgia in February 1738. On stopping at Gibraltar, he preached frequently and attended a Roman Catholic service, which he considered &#145;wholly given to idolatry&#146;  (<span class="italic">George Whitefield's Journals</span>, 128). Amply supported by the colony's trustees, who had authorized him to minister, he arrived in Georgia on 7 May 1738. Inspired by the Halle Orphanage in Germany, he laid plans for a similar institution, returning to England after four months. He energetically solicited moneys and secured the trustees' approval for the orphanage. With their support he was ordained priest by Bishop Benson at Christ Church, Oxford, on 14 January 1739. However, Whitefield's outspoken criticisms of clergymen increased. At St Margaret's, Westminster, supporters physically obstructed the appointed preacher and installed Whitefield in the pulpit. He arrived in Bristol in February, where negative reports from London caused most churches to be closed to him. Two months earlier he had initiated correspondence with Howell Harris, whose example in Wales of open-air preaching perhaps inspired Whitefield now to follow suit. He began by preaching on Kingswood Hill, near Bristol, on 17 February. First hearers were colliery miners, but soon massive crowds came from surrounding areas. Raising money for the orphanage, he also solicited collections for a school for Kingswood miners' children, and laid its foundation-stone on 2 April.<h2>
<a name="Earlytheologicaldisputes"></a>Early theological disputes</h2>In March 1739 Whitefield wrote to John Wesley that he &#145;must come and water what God has enabled me to plant&#146;  (3 March 1739, <span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 25.605). Wesley followed Whitefield's example by preaching in the fields and agreed to assume the Kingswood work. After Whitefield's departure Wesley preached against predestination, stating that believing it &#145;made God worse than a devil&#146;  (Thomas, 27.300). A Calvinistic orientation, not evident in Whitefield's early ministry, had now become central to his thinking. His adherence to predestination set him directly at odds with Wesley, who immediately published his sermon <span class="italic">Free Grace</span>, condemning it. The theological divide publicly opened was never bridged and, especially in this formative period of Methodism, seriously damaged their personal relationship. Whitefield was in London from May to August. Finding churches closed to him, he preached in the open air, regularly on Kennington Common and at Moorfields, taking collections for the Georgia orphanage and frequently preaching for two hours. He claimed attendances as large as 80,000. However many attended, they were numerous and at least curious. John Byrom wrote in June that &#145;Mr Whitefield is the chief topic of conversation&#146;  (J. Byrom, <span class="italic">Private Journal &hellip; of John Byrom</span>, ed. R. Parkinson, 2 vols., 1857, 2(3).246).<br>
<br>By 1739 writing was central to Whitefield's strategy, and before he was twenty-five he had published forty-six sermons. To promote and finance his work he also began publishing journals of his ministry, and seven volumes appeared from 1737 to 1741. Together with two more describing his earlier life, their self-assurance was remarkable. Beginning with the observation that he, like Christ, had been born in an inn, they stated that &#145;God has set His seal to my ministry&#146;  (<span class="italic">George Whitefield's Journals</span>, 207). &#145;The account of my infant years was wrote by the will of God&#146;  (Whitefield to J. Wesley, 8 Nov 1739, <span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 25.699). Regarding a 1737 London sermon, his <span class="italic">Journals</span> recorded that &#145;thousands and thousands of prayers were put up for me. They would run and stop me in the alleys, hug me in their arms, and follow me with wishful looks&#146;  (<span class="italic">George Whitefield's Journals</span>, 92). This confidence he also announced to correspondents. &#145;I am sure I have received angelic blessings. &hellip; The inhabitants are vastly affectionate towards me and are ready to pull out their eyes to give me&#146;  (Thomas, 26.382).<br>
<br>In return, followers assured Whitefield that he was a &#145;faiverite of heaven&#146; or that it would be &#145;no crime to fall down &amp; worship you&#146;  (Library of Congress, Whitefield MSS 2.30, 2.38). One &#145;used to follow him as he walked the streets, and could scarce refrain from kissing the very prints of his feet&#146;  (Jackson, 2.58). However, what to Whitefield's followers was evidence of his God-inspired ministry, to detractors appeared an ego of wide girth. He already had kindled a fierce flame of opposition. His <span class="italic">Journals</span> prompted a sermon in St Paul's Cathedral, where it was wondered if there had ever been &#145;such a medley of vanity, and nonsense, and blasphemy jumbled together?&#146;  (Tyerman, 1.288). He heard himself strongly attacked in a sermon by Joseph Trapp, which precipitated a prolonged and bitter exchange in the press. Trapp called the <span class="italic">Journals</span> blasphemous and Whitefield himself besotted either with pride or madness. Whitefield preached and published against Trapp, &#145;my poor peevish adversary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 5.157), stating that he was no Christian but a servant of Satan. Of the 200 anti-Methodist publications appearing in England during 1739&#150;40, 154 were aimed at Whitefield, triggered by his open-air ministry, his condemnation of the preaching and theology of parish clergymen, and his denouncing Oxford as a &#145;harlot&#146;  (ibid., 1.80).<br>
<br>Whitefield had previously received some support from bishops, yet by 1739 they were revising their opinions. Benson wrote six months after ordaining him priest to caution against acting contrary to that ordination's purpose: settled service in a Georgia parish. Whitefield replied that if bishops rejected him and fellow Methodists, God would furnish their authority. When the bishop of London, Edmund Gibson, published a pamphlet criticizing his claims of divine guidance and his judging of others, Whitefield responded in print, labelling Anglican clerics as lazy, non-spiritual, and pleasure seeking. Rejecting any ecclesiastical authority controlling his actions, he had concluded six weeks after his ordination as priest that &#145;the whole world is now my parish&#146;  (Thomas, 27.91), apparently antedating by a month Wesley's similar statement.<h2>
<a name="AmericasGreatAwakening"></a>America's Great Awakening</h2>Accompanying Whitefield to America in 1739 was a wealthy layman, William Seward, acting as fund-raiser, business co-ordinator, and publicist. He had orchestrated a barrage of printed support in England, including paid newspaper advertisements purporting to be news articles. On Whitefield's first American preaching mission, Seward now furnished newspapers and booksellers there and in Britain with constant material, including copies of Whitefield's writings. All this firmly focused the image of an exuberant trans-Atlantic revival. Seward sent a poem to colonial newspapers, the first stanza of which ran:<blockquote>
<div>Whitefield, the great the pleasing Name,<br>
</div>
<div>Has all my soul possest,<br>
</div>
<div>For sure some Seraph from above<br>
</div>
<div>Inspires his Godlike Breast.<br>
</div> (Trefeca MS 3174)</blockquote>Whitefield, also, sent publicity to printers. Of himself, he wrote: &#145;Great and visible effects followed his preaching, almost wheresoever he went. &hellip; There was never such a general awakening, and concern for things of God known in <i>America</i> before&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.179).<br>
<br>For fifteen months Whitefield preached from New England to Georgia. As in England, he aimed attacks primarily at Anglican clergymen, publicly portraying them as God's persecutors. He told Americans that Bishop Gibson knew &#145;no &hellip; more of Christianity, than <i>Mahaomet</i>, or an Infidel&#146;  (Stephens, 2.307) and advised them &#145;since the Gospel was not preached in the church, to go and hear it in the meeting-houses&#146;  (<span class="italic">George Whitefield's Journals</span>, 444). In Charles Town, South Carolina, the bishop of London's commissary, Alexander Garden, who had been highly supportive in 1738, now wrote to Gibson of his determination to put a stop to &#145;the fascinating Gibberish of Young Geo&#146;  (Kenney, 85). When he suspended him from the Anglican ministry, Whitefield rejected Garden's authority and joined in publishing a letter denouncing all South Carolina's Anglican clergy, for which he was arrested and granted bail. He challenged Commissary Archibald Cummings to a public debate in the press, after Cummings had announced Pennsylvania's Anglican churches henceforth closed to his preaching. His Philadelphia admirers then, in 1740, erected a building for his preaching. Publicly denouncing ministers sent by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, to colonial Anglican clerics he became &#145;the Noisie Mr. Whitefield&#146;  (Hall, 36). He fell to traducing divines long dead, publishing in 1740 against the works of two of Anglicanism's revered seventeenth-century authors. Whitefield wrote that John Tillotson, archbishop of Canterbury, had no more been a true Christian than had Muhammad. In a separate publication he attacked Richard Allestree's <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span>, one of Anglicanism's most popular spiritual tracts, which on at least one occasion Whitefield had his followers cast &#145;into the Fire, with great Detestation&#146;  (Stephens, 2.320). He published these attacks widely in America and in England, and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, which had furnished him religious books for America, ended its support. Whitefield was ironically a godsend to colonial non-Anglicans. Facing increasing opposition from English bishops, he turned the ecclesiastical tables, attacking colonial Anglicans and cutting his clerical cloth to suit America's predominant Calvinist dissenting ethos. He claimed it likely that he would &#145;be set at nought by the Rabbies of our Church, and perhaps at last be killed by them&#146;  (Seward, 71).<br>
<br>Whitefield's arrival coincided with several local American awakenings. By the time he left, his itinerating had provided the sharpest spur in creating a general Great Awakening. In Pennsylvania he supported the revivalist Presbyterian ministers William and Gilbert Tennent, and his preaching caused a major split in that denomination. In the autumn of 1740 he made his first visit to New England, where five people were trampled to death in a Boston Congregational church in the crush to hear him. Crowds followed him everywhere and, as in England, he was the chief topic of conversation. At the invitation of the Congregational minister Jonathan Edwards he preached at Northampton. Although struck with the power of his sermons, Edwards was deeply disturbed by his unqualified appeals to emotion, his openly judging those he considered unconverted, and his demand for instant conversions. Edwards addressed him forcefully in private, but Whitefield refused a discussion. Shortly after Whitefield's departure, Edwards delivered a series of sermons containing but thinly veiled critiques of his preaching techniques, warning against over-dependence upon a preacher's eloquence and fervency.<br>
<br>Whitefield's presence throughout mainland America from 1739 to 1741, and the hearty acclaim and opposition it produced, contributed directly to the expansion of colonial printing. Before arriving in America, Whitefield had published well over 100 imprints in England. The number of American publications nearly doubled from 1738 to 1741, the majority attributable to his presence, and each year from 1739 to 1745 American publishers produced more works by Whitefield than by any other writer on any subject. He struck up a business relationship with Benjamin Franklin. Serving as his main American publisher, Franklin reaped highly lucrative rewards, and many other colonial printers profited. According to a supporter, Whitefield had &#145;made <i>Sermons</i>, once a <i>Drug</i>, a <i>vendible Commodity</i>&#146;  (J. Smith, <span class="italic">Character, Preaching, &amp;c. of &hellip; Whitefield</span>, 1740, 16).<br>
<br>Whitefield's plan for a Georgia orphanage was central to his preaching, and on 25 March 1740 he laid the first brick for what he called Bethesda, 10 miles from Savannah. Although appointed as its parish minister, he did not reach Savannah until January 1740, over fourteen months after arriving in America. He at once informed the trustees that he was giving up the post, though it had been the basis of their support. When they revoked his authority to serve as minister, he insisted on sole control of the orphanage. During 1740 he even kidnapped children and laid claim to their personal possessions. This brought him into sharp conflict with Georgia's founder, James Oglethorpe, who had them removed from Bethesda. When the trustees asked Whitefield to submit financial accounts, he replied that he would never feel obliged to do so. Meanwhile, with Seward's substantial financial contribution he purchased 5000 acres in Pennsylvania, ostensibly to establish a school for black people but also as a bolt-hole for English Methodists if they faced persecution. This project, to be called either Nazareth or English Town, never materialized. On departing for England in 1741, he left Bethesda's supervision with James Habersham, who had accompanied him to Georgia in 1738 and had remained in the colony. Whitefield took an energetic line with children. During the 1738 crossing he beat a four-year-old boy until he recited the Lord's prayer and tied up another until he repeated a psalm. One of the trustees' objections to his control of Bethesda was that &#145;a wrong Method&#146; was taken with the children, who &#145;are often kept praying and crying all the Night&#146;  (Coleman, 271).<h2>
<a name="EnglandandScotland17411744"></a>England and Scotland, 1741&#150;1744</h2>Whitefield had become the most famous person in America but faced serious difficulties upon his return to England in March 1741. He was more than &pound;1000 in debt for Bethesda. Seward, having given a staggering &pound;10,000 for Whitefield's projects, was dead and had left no legacy but a substantial debt, for which Whitefield was under threat of arrest. His assault on Tillotson and <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span> had lost him the support of many followers and had resulted in a huge number of hostile publications. Moreover, his London open-air preaching now attracted decidedly fewer hearers. He had left England as the leader of the new-birth movement, but Wesley now assumed that role. Whitefield wrote bitterly, accusing him of undermining his work and proceeded to preach against him, claiming that Wesley's attacks on predestination had alienated &#145;very many of my spiritual children&#146;, some of whom sent &#145;threatening letters, that God will speedily destroy me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.256&#150;7). During his absence in America their theological conflict had taken on a cutting edge, reflected in their sharp exchange of transatlantic letters. Whitefield had printed in both America and England <span class="italic">A Letter to &hellip; John Wesley: in Answer to his Sermon Entituled, Free-Grace</span> (1741), which Wesley considered a &#145;treacherous&#146; action whereby Whitefield had made himself &#145;odious and contemptible&#146;  (Wesley to Whitefield, 27 April 1741; <span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 26.60&#150;61). Whitefield's remaining London followers in the spring built at Moorfields a large wooden &#145;tabernacle&#146;, close to Wesley's chapel. Wesley travelled widely to counter Whitefield's preaching, publicly shredded a copy of Whitefield's <span class="italic">Letter</span>, and published extensively against predestination. Whitefield took a leading role in the production of <span class="italic">Weekly History</span>, the first Methodist magazine. A mouthpiece for Calvinism, it was also a commercial venture, including advertising from evangelical tradesmen. For Whitefield, &#145;the devotion and business of a Methodist go hand in hand&#146;  (Whitefield, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 654).<br>
<br>Whitefield re-established his relationship with Howell Harris, securing his service at the Tabernacle. Harris stood in awe of Whitefield&#151;&#145;I am not worthy indeed to wipe his feet&#146;  (Trefeca MS 618)&#151;an attitude material in securing Whitefield a wife. While in America, Whitefield proposed marriage by letter to Elizabeth Delamotte of Kent, and her refusal dealt him a severe blow. Intent on finding a wife, he focused on a widow, Mrs Elizabeth James, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burnell (<i>c</i>.1704&#150;1768), already affianced to Harris. At her Abergavenny home she told Whitefield of her love for Harris. Whitefield, replying that he would not be jealous, persisted. A broken-hearted Harris assured the protesting bride that she would be a support to Whitefield's work and officially gave her away when she and Whitefield married on 14 November 1741 in Capel Martin, Caerphilly. Whitefield rejoiced that his wife, about ten years his senior, &#145;would not, I think, attempt to hinder me in [God's] work for the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.363).<br>
<br>Before he married Whitefield had made his first tour in Scotland, from July to October 1741, the first of fourteen visits. Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine, leaders of the breakaway Associate Presbytery, had constantly urged him to come, but upon arrival he discovered that this sect claimed a Christian monopoly and insisted he preach only in their churches. When he refused, they fell upon him mercilessly, branding him a sorcerer, &#145;a poor, vain-glorious, self-seeking, puffed-up creature&#146;, &#145;a limb of AntiChrist; a boar, and a wild beast&#146;  (Tyerman, 2.11). He returned to Scotland in the spring of 1742, and during five months his most notable appearances were at Cambuslang and Kilsyth, where revivals had been initiated. He preached three times on his first day at Cambuslang, writing that the physical outcryings &#145;far out-did all that I ever saw in <i>America</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.405) and that people &#145;are carryd out by Scores as Dead people out of the fi[e]ld&#146;  (Trefeca MS 571). Here, as in America, Whitefield participated in conducting communion services after Presbyterian and Congregationalist forms. While in Scotland he took collections to help pay Bethesda debts. That, and the hysteria of many of his open-air preachings, induced the publication in Edinburgh and Glasgow of seven bitter attacks.<br>
<br>In addition, Whitefield frequently preached in south Wales, usually accompanied by Harris. In 1743 he was appointed at Watford moderator of Calvinistic Methodists in Wales and England. In the autumn Philip Doddridge, holding mixed opinions of Whitefield&#151;&#145;a very honest tho a very weak Man&#146; who &#145;certainly does much good &amp; I am afraid some Harm&#146;  (Nuttall, 705)&#151;preached at the Tabernacle and invited Whitefield to preach at his Northampton Academy. Doddridge received criticism from fellow dissenters, including Isaac Watts. On 4 October 1743 Whitefield's wife gave birth to a son in London. He baptized him at the Tabernacle and announced that God destined John as a noted preacher. Four months later she and the baby stopped at Gloucester. At the inn where Whitefield had been born his son died; he was buried on 8 February 1744 in the church where Whitefield had been baptized.<h2>
<a name="Americanpreachingtour17441748"></a>American preaching tour, 1744&#150;1748</h2>After publishing several further controversial pamphlets, Whitefield, with his wife, departed in the summer of 1744 for what proved his most lengthy American visit. In Boston he faced considerable opposition. Soon after his arrival thirteen pamphlets were published, ten of them highly critical. Two were by the officials of Harvard and Yale. Despite friendly treatment and invitations to preach in 1740, when he published his <span class="italic">Journal</span> in 1741 Whitefield had criticized both their education and Christian commitment, lamenting the lack of zeal of New England's Congregational ministers. Faced with their opposition&#151;&#145;how different from what once they were&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.72)&#151;he claimed that a conspiracy had been mounted. When he left Boston in 1740 Whitefield had induced Gilbert Tennent &#145;to blow up the divine fire&#146; he had &#145;lately kindled there&#146;; &#145;Surely our Lord intends to set <i>America</i> in a flame&#146;  (ibid., 1.220&#150;21). Tennent and another of Whitefield's clerical followers, James Davenport, had done just that, with New England experiencing fearful religious and social turmoil, necessitating the intervention of civil authority. Many claimed that what Whitefield set in motion had led directly to the break-up of New England's orderly parish system, communities, and even families, and most ministers were determined to prevent a fresh burst of disruption. One group proclaimed that &#145;religion is now in a far worse state than it was&#146; before his preaching  (<span class="italic">Declaration of the Association of the County of New Haven</span>, 1745, 6).<br>
<br>A leading Pennsylvania Presbyterian minister, George Gillespie, a former supporter, now issued <span class="italic">Remarks upon Mr George Whitefield, Proving him a Man under Delusion</span>. Revivalist activity generally had subsided significantly, and Whitefield bemoaned the fact that &#145;nobody goes out scarcely but myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.103). Sobered by the level of opposition, he published <span class="italic">A Letter to the &hellip; President and Professors &hellip; of Harvard</span> (1745), which admitted that some of his earlier actions and words had been immature and extreme. However, he saw no reason to implicate himself in the course of events: his &#145;fire&#146; had been pure, he wrote; it had been corrupted by the &#145;wild-fire&#146; of others  (ibid., 2.73). Attempting to re-establish his reputation in New England, he preached in April 1745 to Massachusetts troops before their campaign against the French at Louisburg, opining that &#145;Canada is to be given us&#146;  (Christie, 267). When news of the Jacobite defeat at Culloden arrived the following year he preached and published <span class="italic">Britain's Mercies, and Britain's Duty</span>. Printed both in America and Britain&#151;as were nearly all his productions&#151;this stated Methodist loyalty to the crown.<br>
<br>Still finding that &#145;many ministers and the heads of the people&#146; in New England &#145;would not bear&#146; his ministry  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.93), Whitefield focused on southern plantation provinces (in South Carolina, Alexander Garden again announced his dismissal from the Anglican priesthood). Whitefield's base was the home of the extremely wealthy Baynard family at Bohemia Manor, Maryland. He wrote that &#145;favour is given me in the sight of the rich and great &hellip; [I] sometimes think I shall never return to <i>England</i>&#146;  (ibid., 2.83). Still deeply in debt for Bethesda, he increased efforts to secure donations from well-to-do supporters. James Habersham having departed Bethesda in 1744, Whitefield often left Elizabeth there to supervise its fabric, copy letters, and serve as press agent. Zeal for Bethesda led to a fateful course of action. Whitefield published in 1740 a criticism of slaves' treatment in the southern colonies and occasionally preached to slaves. However, as early as 1738 he had desired an ending of the trustees' prohibition of slavery in Georgia, and the abortive &#145;school&#146; for black people in Pennsylvania was actually planned as a slave institution. In 1747 his local supporters Hugh and Jonathan Bryan purchased for him in the neighbouring slavery stronghold, South Carolina, Providence Plantation, stocked with slaves as income for Bethesda. He now wooed leading planters, who contributed nearly &pound;300 for the purchase of further slaves. In 1750 the trustees sanctioned slavery, and Whitefield developed a fulsome defence of the institution, claiming its full scriptural justification. &#145;As for the lawfulness of keeping slaves, I have no doubt&#146;  (ibid., 2.404). Over the coming years he added to his stock of slaves, with preaching tours focused on raising money for that purpose. &#145;Blessed be God for the increase of the negroes&#146;  (ibid., 3.211). Whitefield had emerged as perhaps the most energetic, and conspicuous, evangelical defender and practitioner of slavery.<h2>
<a name="ThemiddleperiodinEngland17481763"></a>The middle period in England, 1748&#150;1763</h2>Despite stating that he might remain in America, by 1748 Whitefield had returned to England, attracted by the countess of Huntingdon's desire that he become her personal chaplain. The day of his London arrival, 5 July, &#145;fearing to offend the Countess&#146;  (T. Beynon, 201), he presented himself; on 1 September she made the appointment official. Before he left America it was observed that he had &#145;become exceeding stately, relishing only the Company of the greatest&#146;  (Candler, 52). After he began preaching at the countess's London salon services, a supporter noted that he &#145;preaches more Considered among persons of a Superior Rank who frequent your Ladyship's Lodgings&#146;  (Huntingdon MS B46). &#145;The prospect of catching some of the rich in the gospel net is very promising&#146;, wrote Whitefield. When he and the countess were in London he preached twice a week at such gatherings. He was deferential to a fault, telling her that her conduct was &#145;truly god-like&#146;. &#145;Tears trickle from my eyes, whilst I am thinking of your Ladyship's condescending to patronize such a dead dog as I am&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.220, 238; 3.120). He added his position as her chaplain to his title in subsequent publications and refashioned aspects of his ministry to meet her approval. Admitting that many of his English converts had been guilty of &#145;real madness and ranticism&#146;  (T. Beynon, 208), he became far more circumspect towards clerical opponents. He had told others &#145;of all the scriptures, promises, dreams and providence that have been given him as to his being made Bishop&#146;  (ibid., 41) and now, probably encouraged by her, considered this remarkable notion a near certainty. When a bishop accused him of perjury, Whitefield's restrained reply stated that &#145;the relation in which I stand to the Right Honourable the Countess of H----&#146; made him &#145;desirous to clear myself from such an imputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.271). He said that he highly esteemed bishops of the Church of England because of their sacred character. When also in 1749 he was severely attacked in print by another bishop, the disarming subtitle of Whitefield's rejoinder was: &#145;Wherein several Mistakes in some Parts of his [Whitefield's] past Writings and Conduct are acknowledged&#146;. To a correspondent he wrote: &#145;Alas! alas! In how many things have I judged and acted wrong &hellip; I have been too bitter in my zeal&#146;  (ibid., 2.144). His level of publishing subsided dramatically. During the first fourteen years of his ministry English and American publishers issued his works at an average rate of about twenty-five a year, but from 1750 the annual output declined to about three. Revising his <span class="italic">Journals</span>, he removed what he considered offending passages. However, he stated that the changes should not be considered &#145;express retractions&#146;  (Huntingdon MS B46) and did not publish the revision until 1756. When asked if it were &#145;true that Whitfield has recanted?&#146; Lady Townshend replied: &#145;No, Sir, he has only canted&#146;  (H. Walpole to Horace Mann, 3 May 1749, Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 20.52).<br>
<br>Before his 1748 return Whitefield spent three months in Bermuda, preaching frequently and collecting &pound;100, some of which he sent for the personal support of Elizabeth, whom he had left in America. Her return to England over a year later coincided with growing hostility between Harris and Whitefield. She and Harris also fell into bitter confrontation. The complicated relationship between the three contributed to Whitefield's dismissal of Harris from the Tabernacle. Harris said that Whitefield's &#145;preaching hurts christians&#146; and that he &#145;is now against our Saviour&#146;  (T. Beynon, 259, 277). The breach was never healed. Lady Huntingdon's immediate purpose being their conversion, Whitefield initiated correspondence with several members of the aristocracy. He boasted of his new position, not least to Wesley. Since the early 1740s, they made occasional valiant efforts to patch their torn relationship for the sake of Methodist unity; however, they remained deeply divided theologically, and the fabric was beyond repair. Wesley could not forget Whitefield's published claim that &#145;Infidels of all Kinds are on your Side of the Question&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letter to Wesley</span>, 22). Even though at Whitefield's request Wesley preached his London funeral sermon, he in the end concluded that Whitefield had constantly ill-treated him and that the division had been caused by &#145;Mr. Whitefield himself&#146;  (Wesley to Thomas Maxfield, 14 Feb 1778, Wesley, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 6.304).<br>
<br>Chaplain to the countess of Huntingdon, Whitefield gave up his nominal leadership of the Calvinistic Methodists, intending to keep &#145;myself free from societies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.172). However, he was not free of his London Tabernacle, the affairs of which were at a low state. During his American absence vast numbers of members, and several preachers, had left to join the Moravians. Early in his ministry he was influenced by this church and had often used Moravian terminology in his preaching, such as &#145;the Bleeding God, Agonizing God, Dying God&#146;  (T. Beynon, 13). Now he condemned them and in 1753 published a pamphlet attacking their leader, Count Nicholas Zinzendorf, together with their worship practices, and accused them of obtaining vast sums of money dishonestly. Previous close supporters, Moravian leaders were now livid. James Hutton, his former London printer, called Whitefield &#145;a Mahomet, a Caesar, an imposter, a Don Quixote, a devil, the beast, the man of sin, the Antichrist&#146;  (Benham, 579&#150;80). John Syms threatened to make public Whitefield's most secret affairs. Six months after his return in 1748 he observed that where before 20,000 people would come to hear him in the open air, now there were not more than a hundred. He redoubled his efforts and during 1750 pursued a punishing regime in London and many areas of England and Scotland, ending the year confined to bed. &#145;My continual vomitings almost kill me, and yet the pulpit is my cure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.345). Largely through Lady Huntingdon's generosity a new Tabernacle was erected on the spot of the old and opened on 10 June 1753. Also that year he opened a chapel in Bristol, again with Lady Huntingdon's financial backing. She also provided substantial sums for his personal use, and in London he lived in some comfort.<br>
<br>After a brief journey to Georgia and South Carolina from October 1751 to April 1752 to extend his land and slave holdings, two years later Whitefield returned to America, taking twenty-two English children to Bethesda. Most of the ten months of this visit were again spent in the south, although he also visited New England and the middle colonies. During the summer of 1754 he received an honorary MA from the College of New Jersey, which he used in publications in a manner suggesting that it was an Oxford degree. On returning to England in the spring of 1755, he published vivid accounts depicting Holy Week processions in Lisbon, where he had spent a month on his outward journey.<br>
<br>Whitefield had long desired to position himself in London's West End, close to its theatres, and late in 1755 he was offered the use of the dissenters' Long Acre Chapel. The incumbent of the parish, St Martin-in-the-Fields, attempted to put a stop to Whitefield's services there. Frequent disturbances were made outside the chapel, and in April 1756 he received three anonymous letters threatening his life. These commotions persuaded him of the need for his own building in the area, and in November he opened his second London chapel, in Tottenham Court Road, designed for a higher class of auditor than the Tabernacle. Three years later, much extended, Tottenham was the largest nonconformist church building in Britain and probably in the world. Although a similar residence was built, he and Elizabeth continued to live at the Tabernacle house. During the Long Acre unrest, Whitefield published <span class="italic">A Short Address to Persons of All Denominations, Occasioned by the Alarm of an Intended Invasion</span> (1756). Violently anti-French, it stated that &#145;British arms were never more formidable, than when our soldiers went forth in the strength of the Lord; and, with a <span class="roman">Bible</span> in one hand, and a sword in the other, cheerfully fought under His banner&#146;  (Tyerman, 2.370). The usually hostile London <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> found that Whitefield &#145;here makes good use of the influence he has acquired over the common people&#146;  (ibid., 2.371, n.). It also was a diatribe against Roman Catholicism. Certain that they had sent the threatening Long Acre letters, he railed against papists who, he said, had &#145;massacred, in cold blood&#146;, &#145;tens of thousands of innocent, unprovoking Irish Protestants&#146; a century earlier. Now &#145;popish priests&#146; were again planning to murder protestants  (ibid., 2.371). He carried this message to Scotland in the autumn. The following summer, 1757, again preaching there, Whitefield attended the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, which he highly commended, and then proceeded to Ireland, which he had visited in 1738 and 1751. Now, in the open air in Dublin, he spoke out against Roman Catholicism and was attacked by &#145;hundreds and hundreds of papists&#146; who wounded him severely and smashed his portable pulpit. Taking refuge in a coach, he rode &#145;in gospel triumph through the oaths, curses, and imprecations of whole streets of papists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.208). It was his final visit to Ireland.<br>
<br>Throughout his ministry Whitefield was especially vigorous in condemning public amusements of all kinds: musical concerts, dances, card playing, and the theatre. On one occasion he upbraided an eminent dissenting minister for singing in a London tavern a song in praise of old English beef. Towards the end of 1759 Whitefield preached a sermon threatening London theatregoers with damnation. This was reciprocated with a vengeance by numerous satirical productions, based on the premise that Whitefield was himself a consummate actor. As early as 1746 he was introduced as the adulterous Doctor Preach Field in the production of Charles Macklin's <span class="italic">A Will and No Will</span>. Now in 1760 he was treated by the leading theatrical satirist, Samuel Foote. In <span class="italic">The Minor</span> Whitefield was called Squintum, occasioned by the severe squint in his left eye. Squintum was thenceforward the satirist's usual appellation suggesting that Whitefield focused on the carnal while gazing heavenward. By September <span class="italic">The Minor</span> had graced stages as far afield as Newcastle and later crossed the Atlantic. <span class="italic">The Spiritual Minor</span> (1763) and <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span> (1768) followed, and Whitefield was the target of most of the satirical writing directed against the Methodist movement. He was harshly handled by novelists in Fielding's <span class="italic">Joseph Andrews</span> (1742) and <span class="italic">Tom Jones</span> (1749), and in Smollett's <span class="italic">Humphry Clinker</span> (1771). Richard Graves, who had graduated with Whitefield from Pembroke College, portrayed him in <span class="italic">The Spiritual Quixote</span> (1772), where the preacher Wildgoose uttered quotations from Whitefield's publications. A satirical print by Hogarth, <span class="italic">Credulity, Superstition and Fanaticism</span> (1762), sold widely.<br>
<br>Whitefield was of average height, with fair complexion and small, dark-blue eyes. As a young man slender, by the late 1750s he had become decidedly corpulent (a change vividly portrayed in his portraits). In 1761 and 1762 he was severely ill and sought medical advice in Bath, Edinburgh, and the Netherlands. &#145;I am weary&#146;, he wrote, &#145;of the world, of the church, and of myself&#146;, and believed that &#145;a voyage would brace me up&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.283, 271). In all, he spent perhaps two years of his life at sea and was, in his own words, &#145;an amphibious itinerant&#146;  (JRL, PLP 113.1.20). In 1763, after over eight years' absence, Whitefield was anxious to visit America. Added to distress at satirical attacks was weariness with overseeing his two London chapels. Their management he left to laymen, with instructions not to &#145;consult me in any thing, unless absolutely necessary&#146;, adding that he could not &#145;bear the[ir] cares&#146; even when in London  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.290, 326).<h2>
<a name="Thefinalyears"></a>The final years</h2>Most of Whitefield's American visit from 1763 to 1765 was spent in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, where he received thanks for collecting funds in England after a Boston fire in 1760. A further mending of fences was indicated by an invitation to preach at Yale. After reaching America in September 1763, it was sixteen months before he arrived at Bethesda. In 1757 he had instructed his agents to send away most of the orphans. &#145;I pity them, but they must blame their parents &hellip; I am determined to take in no more than the plantation will maintain, till I can buy more negroes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.211). It became clear that he had all along viewed Bethesda as a prospective college; at the end of 1764 he petitioned Georgia's authorities to that effect. He also produced accounts of his financial stewardship, similar to those frequently published over the years.<br>
<br>Back in England, on 6 October 1765 Whitefield preached at the opening of Lady Huntingdon's Bath chapel. During his final decade the bulk of his publications were devotional, including prefaces to a new edition of Samuel Clarke's annotated <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1759) and to Bunyan's collected works (1767). There were two exceptions. In 1763 he issued a rebuttal to a publication against Methodism, though in it he repeated contrition for much contained in his <span class="italic">Journals</span>. The other was his final pamphlet. When six students at St Edmund Hall, Oxford&#151;with whom he had been closely involved&#151;were expelled in 1768 for Methodistic practices, he published <span class="italic">A Letter to the Reverend Dr Durell, Vice-Chancellor</span>, disingenuously denying connection with the students but protesting at their treatment. That summer he made his last journey to Scotland, reporting that he was &#145;in danger of being hugged to death&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.371). He raised collections for Indian education in New England. His wife died of a fever on 9 August 1768 and was buried in a vault at the Tottenham chapel. After their 1744&#150;8 stay in America, where she suffered four miscarriages, she never accompanied him on his travels, remaining at the Tabernacle house. Whitefield reported that &#145;none in America could bear her&#146;  (T. Beynon, 16), while she said that she had been &#145;but a load &amp; burden&#146; to him  (Trefeca MS 1535). It was observed after their 1748 return that she was refusing to submit to him, and that his treatment of her left much to be desired. She concluded that she was &#145;altogether unfit &amp; unworthy&#146; to be his wife  (JRL, PLP 113.2.2). Cornelius Winter, who latterly lived with them, reported that Whitefield &#145;was not happy in his wife&#146;, though he &#145;did not intentionally make his wife unhappy&#146;. However, &#145;her death set his mind much at liberty&#146;. Winter also reported that in general personal relationships Whitefield &#145;was impatient of contradiction&#146;. Once, when his sharpness drove to tears someone trying to please him, he &#145;burst into tears, saying, &#147;I shall live to be a poor peevish old man, and every body will be tired of me&#148;&#146;  (Jay, 81).<br>
<br>Whitefield preached at the opening of the countess of Huntingdon's Trevecca College in Wales on 24 August 1768, as he did at the opening of her Tunbridge Wells chapel on 23 July 1769. He abruptly left for America in September 1769, arriving at Bethesda in December. In spite of objections from ministerial colleagues, who said that since all his collections had been solicited for an orphanage he was not free to transform Bethesda, Whitefield had pursued his plans for a college. Unsuccessful in securing a royal charter, he received a more favourable response from the governor and council of Georgia. He left Georgia in April 1770, preaching in Philadelphia, New York, and New England, there making outspoken common cause with American patriots. As early as 1764 he announced in Boston: &#145;O poor New England! There is a deep laid plot against both your civil and religious liberties&#146;  (C. Bridenbaugh, <span class="italic">Mitre and Sceptre</span>, 1962, 244). Critical of the 1765 <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, the following year he wrote: &#145;<span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> repealed, <i>Gloria Deo</i>&#146;  (Gillies, 248). He notified New Englanders that he would &#145;serve our civil as well as religious Interests&#146;  (S. Adams, <span class="italic">Writings of Samuel Adams</span>, ed. H. Cushing, 4 vols., 1904&#150;8, 1.26). He attended the House of Commons in 1766 to hear Benjamin Franklin's presentation of colonial grievances and wrote a letter, published in America, praising his performance. (However, their relationship ended in 1769 on a sour note, when Franklin made clear his rejection of Whitefield's religious prescriptions.) In a farewell sermon to his London chapels, setting out on his seventh and final journey to America, Whitefield seemed to burn his British bridges: he denounced &#145;the great mischiefs the poor pious [Boston] people suffered lately through the town's being disturbed by the [British] soldiers&#146;  (Whitefield, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 712).<br>
<br>Although there were frequent references to vomitings during the 1740s and 1750s, probably during 1760&#150;61 his &#145;constitution &hellip; received its material shock&#146;  (Jay, 36). He was described, at the age of fifty, as &#145;an old, old man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of John Wesley</span>, 5.150). Cornelius Winter said that, following each time of preaching, as soon as &#145;he was seated in his chair, nature demanded relief, and gained it by a vast discharge from the stomach, usually with a considerable quantity of blood&#146;, before he could speak  (Jay, 26). Wesley described him early in 1769 as sinking towards death. Whitefield often expressed the desire to die in the pulpit and after arriving in New England in August 1770 preached almost daily for the next two months. Following a two-hour open-air sermon he died at the age of fifty-five at 6 a.m. on Sunday 30 September 1770, in the house of the Presbyterian minister of Newburyport, Massachusetts, apparently from angina pectoris. The funeral was in the Newburyport church on 2 October, and he was buried beneath the pulpit. His death cemented his relationship with America. To New Englanders he had been a &#145;real patriot&#146;  (N. Whitaker, <span class="italic">Funeral Sermon</span>, 1771, 34). Another put it in verse:<blockquote>
<div>When his Americans were burden'd sore<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip; Unrival'd friendship in his breast now strove:<br>
</div>
<div>The fruit thereof was charity and love<br>
</div>
<div>Towards America.<br>
</div> (P. Wheatley, <span class="italic">An Elegiac Poem</span>, 1770, 6)</blockquote>Five years later several American patriot soldiers entered Whitefield's crypt, cut off small pieces of his garments, and carried them as amulets into battle against British troops. Whitefield, who spent nine of his ministry's thirty-four years there, had become an American icon.<br>
<br>Whitefield bequeathed sums to friends and family members totalling nearly &pound;1500. Questions concerning the source of his personal wealth dogged his memory. His will stated that all this money had lately been left him &#145;in a most unexpected way and unthought of means&#146;  (JRL, PLP 113.1.23). However, much earlier he had lodged &pound;1000 for his wife if predeceasing her and had personally contributed &pound;3300 to Bethesda. He willed everything in Georgia to the countess of Huntingdon, including 4000 acres of land and fifty slaves, commissioning her to pursue his college plan. However, at his death Bethesda still bore a debt of &pound;1235, and soon it lay in ruins. Despite the enormous total of &pound;16,000 expended, only 180 children had at various sporadic times been resident since its founding. Whitefield's most faithful London lay supporter was astonished at the accounts and concluded &#145;that Mr Whitefield was not directed from above&#146; with Bethesda, &#145;as no good ever came from it either in spiritual or temporal&#146;  (Huntingdon MS A1/8/5).<h2>
<a name="Whitefieldaspreacher"></a>Whitefield as preacher</h2>Franklin attended one of Whitefield's open-air preachings, determined not to contribute to the orphanage, yet found himself turning out his pockets owing to the eloquence of the appeal. Whitefield, denouncing the theatre, was a consummate actor, bringing drama and novelty to countless people. He preached on perhaps 18,000 occasions, and many sermons were perfected by constant repetition. Preaching without note or sermon plan, never stumbling at a word, with constant anecdotes (at which he excelled), and even humour, he utilized his arresting voice and oratorical skills, set off with gestures and vivid part-playing. Towards the close of a sermon he occasionally donned a black cap after the manner of a condemning judge, proclaiming, &#145;sinner, I must do it; I must pronounce sentence upon you&#146;. He would then, &#145;in a tremendous strain of eloquence, recite our Lord's words, &#147;Go ye cursed,&#148; not without a very powerful description of the nature of the curse&#146;  (Jay, 24). When describing Peter's bitter weeping, Whitefield would catch a fold of his gown to wipe away tears. One ardent attender at Tottenham Court Road was &#145;agreeably entertained with his manner of preaching&#146; but could not &#145;discern any difference between Mr. Whitefield's preaching and seeing a good tragedy&#146;  (Jackson, 5.225). Another observed that he &#145;could play well on an instrument. &hellip; But I did not understand him, though I might hear him twenty times&#146;  (ibid., 1.13). In Pennsylvania a German woman who understood no English was blessed merely by his gestures, looks, and voice. Franklin praised his voice and dramatic timing, so &#145;that without being interested in the Subject, one could not help being pleas'd with the Discourse&#146;  (B. Franklin, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. L. W. Labaree, 1964, 180). Men such as Lord Chesterfield held similar views.<br>
<br>A further aspect of Whitefield's preaching was tears, a homiletic hallmark. He also expected them from hearers, since tears were his litmus test for judging effect. Wesley commented that often when preaching Whitefield's &#145;<i>head [was] as waters</i>, and his <i>eyes as a fountain of tears</i>&#146;  (Tyerman, 2.617). Winter said that &#145;I hardly ever knew him to go through a sermon without weeping &hellip; sometimes he exceedingly wept, stamped loudly and passionately, and was frequently so overcome, that, for a few seconds, you would suspect he never could recover&#146;  (Jay, 27&#150;8). The former slave Olaudah Equiano observed that he &#145;sweat[ed] as much as I ever did while in slavery&#146;  (P. Edwards, ed., <span class="italic">Equiano's Travels</span>, 1989, 92). Samuel Johnson believed that Whitefield &#145;would be followed by crowds were he to wear a night-cap in the pulpit, or were he to preach from a tree&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.79). However, though frequently veering from dramatic bathos to condemnation, he was at times capable of careful and compelling antithesis.<h2>
<a name="Historicalperspective"></a>Historical perspective</h2>&#145;I never in my life knew any person so much idolized by some, and railed at by others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar</span>, ed. Nuttall, 4.265). This contemporary observation crisply poses the problem for historical evaluation. The first biography, John Gillies's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (which contains Whitefield's account of his Bermuda visit and portions of the now lost manuscript journal of his later years), appeared less than two years after Whitefield's death, specifically to spike continuing negative images of his ministry, not least concerning financial affairs. Gillies simultaneously published his <span class="italic">Works</span>, the first three volumes containing 1465 of Whitefield's letters, to which, as editor, he made alterations of substance and style. That the originals of only a few have survived, together with a limited number of others, has presented historians with severe difficulties. Recent writing has focused on specific aspects of his career, such as his &#145;acting&#146; or his contribution to an expanding consumer economy. Those attempting biographies, from Gillies on, have done so from a non-Anglican viewpoint and have painted with a hagiographic brush. While sometimes admitting his frequent lack of judgement, they have exonerated him by emphasizing his genius as a preacher. However, there is no adequate corpus of printed sermons (a total of seventy-nine, of which fifty-seven were published by Whitefield), and their general quality has always disappointed even his most ardent admirers. Moreover, it is accepted that without his &#145;voice and motion&#146; his printed sermons convey &#145;but a very faint idea&#146;  (Jay, 30). While it is impossible to gauge the lasting impact of his sermonic power upon the multitudes who heard him, a number of ministers were in no doubt that by it they had received their own experiences of conversion, and many were induced to attempt to emulate his preaching. In many ways a puritan redivivus, George Whitefield re-energized the Calvinist message. Throughout his ministry, and since, the debate over his character and his contribution to Christianity has continued; yet for more than a generation his robust ministry and compelling passionate proclamation of the necessity of a new birth made him the eighteenth century's most sensational preacher in Great Britain and America.<br>
