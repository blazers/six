<span class="headword">FitzClarence,  George Augustus Frederick</span>, first earl of Munster  (1794&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Somerset Street, London, on the morning of 29 January 1794, the eldest of the ten children born to the actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15119/', "Dorothy Jordan (1761&#150;1816)")</script> and the duke of Clarence, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29451/', "King William IV")</script>. He spent many of his early months in the theatre, where his mother continued to perform. Destined by his father for the army, he was educated at a private school at Sunbury before going to the Royal Military College at Great Marlow. He was appointed cornet in the prince of Wales's regiment, the 10th hussars, on 5 February 1807, at the age of thirteen. The following year he sailed for the Peninsular War; the duke of Clarence wrote of his &#145;real uneasiness&#146; at sending one of his &#145;extream youth&#146; to war, adding &#145;The distress of Mrs Jordan is not to be described: however &hellip; she sees the propriety of his going&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, 6.514). In Spain he served as aide-de-camp to General Slade at the battle of Corunna, and early distinguished himself, winning the approval of his uncle, the prince of Wales. Back in Portugal in April 1809, he was galloper to Brigadier Sir Charles Stewart (later second marquess of Londonderry), then Wellington's adjutant-general. Wounded in the leg at Talavera in July, he returned to Portugal the following April and saw out the rest of the campaign, having been promoted to a troop. (In 1831 he published a vivid <span class="italic">Account of the British Campaign in Spain and Portugal in 1809</span>.)<br>
<br>FitzClarence was in England at the time of his parents' separation; like all the children of the union, he was placed in the difficult position of sympathizing entirely with his abandoned mother, while owing his profession and livelihood to his father's family, especially the prince regent. Ambitious, and all too conscious of his anomalous position as an illegitimate son, he tended to rail against the limited promotion prospects for men without money in his regiment, drawing from his father the anxious reminder that &#145;The Prince [Regent] will take care of you if you are attentive&#146;  (Tomalin, 281). He went abroad in 1813, serving through the campaigns of 1813&#150;14 in Spain and the south of France, first as deputy assistant adjutant-general, and then with his regiment. He distinguished himself at Pamplona in 1813 and was again wounded while leading a squadron at Toulouse in 1814. When the regiment returned to England, FitzClarence (and his brother Henry) were among the twenty-four officers who signed an accusation of incompetence and neglect of duty against their commanding officer, Colonel Quentin. At the subsequent court martial, presided over by another uncle, the duke of York, Quentin was reprimanded, but the wrath of the court was brought against his accusers. FitzClarence was accused of being a ringleader, and all of the officers were stripped of their swords and dismissed from the regiment.<br>
<br>FitzClarence and his brother were sent in disgrace to join the 24th light dragoons in India, where the governor-general, Lord Moira, was urged to treat them &#145;with the strictest discipline, not to say severity&#146;  (Tomalin, 284). FitzClarence was Moira's aide-de-camp and as such served in the campaigns of 1816&#150;17 against the Marathas, and found great favour with his chief, who reported back to England that &#145;He is perfectly attentive to his duty, strictly correct in his manner, &amp; much liked by all the officers in my family&#146;  (Moira to Colonel McMahon, <span class="italic">Letters of George IV</span>, 2.170). Henry FitzClarence died in India in September 1817, some months after receiving news of his mother's death, and in December George was sent back to England bearing the dispatches of the peace treaty signed with Maharaja Sindhia, via the overland route. He subsequently published an account of his travels, <span class="italic">Journal of a route across India and through Egypt to England, in the latter end of 1817 and the beginning of 1818</span>, which marked the beginning of a series of scholarly interests. FitzClarence was to become a fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Royal Geographical, Antiquarian, Astronomical, and Geological societies of London, and a founder member of the Royal Asiatic Society (of which he was chosen president a year before his death). He was a member of the society's committee preparing plans for publishing translations of oriental works, and was subsequently deputy chairman and vice-president of the Oriental Translation Fund. He was also to be president of the Society for the Publication of Oriental Texts. His own researches lead to the publication of a paper on the employment of Muslim mercenaries in Christian armies in the <span class="italic">Journal Asiatique</span>, 56 (February 1827), and with the aid of his secretary and amanuensis, Dr Aloys Sprenger (later principal of Delhi College) he collected a vast amount of material for a projected &#145;history of the art of war among eastern nations&#146;.<br>
<br>FitzClarence remained in the army on his return to England. He became a brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1819, and subsequently obtained a troop in the 14th light dragoons, commanded the 6th carabiniers for a short time as regimental major in Ireland, and served as captain and lieutenant-colonel of the Coldstream Guards from July 1825 to December 1828, afterwards retiring as lieutenant-colonel on half-pay unattached.<br>
<br>Married on 18 October 1819 to Mary Wyndham (<i>d</i>. 1842), the illegitimate daughter of the third earl of Egremont, with whom he had four sons and three daughters (the eldest of whom was prudently named Adelaide after his stepmother), FitzClarence was unhappy in his domestic life, and he retained a strong sense of grievance arising from the circumstances of his birth. This unhappiness was strengthened when in 1830 the duke of Clarence became king, for now the indignities of being the recognized, but illegitimate, eldest son of the monarch weighed heavily on him. Feeling the injustice of his situation led him (along with his brothers) to press his father for honours, recognition, and hard cash. Hoping to be raised to a dukedom (in the manner of Charles II's illegitimate family), he threatened suicide when William IV prevaricated; finally, in June 1831 he was created earl of Munster, but was not content. Determined to be recognized as the king's son, he demanded &#145;Let me carry your crown at the Coronation &hellip; Who is more fit than your own <i>flesh and blood</i>?&#146;  (Ziegler, 158). The king was furious, and their relationship was henceforth plagued with violent quarrels. He was appointed governor of Windsor Castle and constable of the Round Tower, and sworn of the privy council, and was accused of attempting to influence the king against the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. At William IV's death, they were still unreconciled, despite various attempts by the king to heal the breach between them.<br>
<br>Victoria's accession to the throne that would, had his parents been married, have been his own, served only to exacerbate Munster's misery. Victoria's mother, the duchess of Kent, had used the presence of the FitzClarences at William IV's court as an excuse for keeping her daughter away from the king; Victoria herself was more forgiving, and Munster retained his appointments. This was insufficiently consoling to the unhappy man, and, on the night of Sunday 20 March 1842, Munster shot himself in his library in Belgrave Square, London, having first written to the queen. He was buried in the parish church at Hampton.<br>
<br>Lord Melbourne wrote to the queen that Munster &#145;was always &hellip; an unhappy and discontented man, and there is something in that unfortunate condition of illegitimacy which seems to distort the mind and feelings and render them incapable of justice or contentment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 1st ser., 2.486). The early nineteenth century was an inhospitable place for illegitimate royal offshoots: the over-reaction to the Quentin affair clearly showed some residual fears that the illegitimate son might foment wider discontent, but Munster was no Monmouth. Publicly derided for that condition over which he had no control, Munster shared Edmund's resentment in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">Why brand they us<br>
</div>
<div>With base? with baseness? bastardy?<br>
</div>
</blockquote>&#151;and his heartfelt cry, &#145;Now, gods, stand up for bastards&#146;; the gods did not listen.<br>
