</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Feilding,  Robert</span>  (1650/51&#150;1712), <span class="occ">rake and bigamist</span>, was born at Solihull, Warwickshire, the son of George Feilding, landowner, a kinsman of the earl of Denbigh. Nothing is known about his mother. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1673, but upon inheriting &pound;600 on the death of his father abandoned a legal career in favour of an extravagant lifestyle. He was a frequent visitor to the court of Charles II where he acquired the nickname Handsome, or Beau, Feilding on account of his exceptional good looks and lavish attire. Jonathan Swift in his fragment of autobiography says that Feilding married Mary, only daughter of Barnham Swift (known as Cavaliero), Viscount Carlingford (<i>d</i>. 1635), who &#145;brought him a considerable Estate in Yorkshire, which he squandered away&#146;  (Swift, 187). Feilding afterwards married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1698), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3996/', "Ulick Burke, marquess of Clanricarde")</script>, previously the wife of Donough MacCarthy, second Viscount Muskerry, killed at sea in 1665, and Robert Danvers, third Viscount Purbeck, killed in a duel at Li&egrave;ge in 1684.<br>
<br>During the reign of James II Feilding became a Catholic. It would appear that he served as a justice of the peace for Middlesex, and may have been one of the justices who desired that the king would dispense with taking the test in 1687. A loyal supporter of James II, who gave him a regiment, he followed the king to Ireland and served as MP for Gowran in the Irish parliament of 1689. He later joined the exiled king in Paris, from where he petitioned for his own pardon in January 1692. By 1696 Feilding had returned to England and was imprisoned for a time in Newgate as a Jacobite, eventually securing his pardon in June 1697. Feilding once again became renowned as a womanizer and notorious for his extravagant habits. He cut a conspicuous figure in London society by travelling in a black coach accompanied by footmen dressed in yellow coats with black feathers in their hats and black sashes. He maintained his opulent lifestyle by being kept as a &#145;stallion&#146; by a series of wealthy mistresses and also through gambling. He engaged in many fraudulent practices, such as bribing jockeys at race meetings, which, when discovered, led to his being beaten by several noblemen. His ostentatious lifestyle led him to fight several duels. In 1696 a reward of &pound;200 was offered for his arrest after he had wounded the MP and justice of the peace Sir Henry Colt. At the age of fifty Feilding was himself seriously injured after fighting with one Mr Fulwood, a barrister of Gray's Inn, at the theatre. He later made a habit of displaying his wound to ladies in order to win their &#145;love and pity&#146;, but, as Swift observes, they &#145;fell a laughing&#146; instead  (Swift, 86).<br>
<br>Feilding's wife died on 14 August 1698 and in 1705 he once again turned to marriage as a means of restoring his dwindling fortune. During the summer of 1705 he assiduously courted the wealthy and newly widowed Barbara Palmer, duchess of Cleveland (1641&#150;1709), a former mistress of Charles II. At the same time he had designs on a recently bereaved young widow named Anne Deleau, reported to have a fortune of &pound;60,000&#151;a fact which Feilding ascertained by scrutinizing her late husband's will. Feilding visited her house at Waddon, near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on pretence of viewing the gardens and succeeded in obtaining a glimpse of the reclusive widow through a window. He sent her a number of love letters which were apparently destroyed by her servants, knowing Feilding's notorious character and suspecting his mercenary designs. At length Feilding sought the assistance of Charlotte Henrietta Villars, Mrs Deleau's hairdresser, promising her &pound;500 for her help in winning over the widow. Knowing that Mrs Deleau was unlikely to consent to marrying Feilding, Villars disguised an acquaintance, a poor woman named Mary Wadsworth, as the widow and arranged a meeting with Feilding at his London lodgings. On their second visit on 9 November 1705 a Catholic priest was fetched, who married Feilding to Mary Wadsworth, believing her to be Anne Deleau. In the meantime Feilding continued his pursuit of the duchess of Cleveland, whom he married on 25 November 1705.<br>
<br>In May 1706 Feilding discovered the cheat of his marriage to &#145;Mrs Deleau&#146; when he visited the real widow's house at Waddon and demanded to see his wife. He beat Mary Wadsworth and threatened severe violence against Charlotte Villars if she should reveal this marriage. However, the two women conveyed their story to the duchess of Cleveland via her grandson, the duke of Grafton. By this time Feilding's relations with the duchess had begun to deteriorate. He beat her and locked her up when she refused to give him money, and during spring 1706 Feilding began a sexual relationship with her granddaughter, Charlotte Calvert, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lee (1679&#150;1721), wife of Benedict Leonard Calvert, fourth Lord Baltimore. Feilding is believed to have fathered the child born to Charlotte on 23 April 1707. The duchess began proceedings in the London consistory court to annul her marriage to Feilding on account of his prior marriage to Mary Wadsworth, obtaining sentence on 23 May 1707. On 4 December 1706 Feilding was found guilty of bigamy at the Old Bailey. He escaped the death penalty by pleading benefit of clergy and also evaded the lesser penalty of being burnt in the hand by producing a warrant from Queen Anne to suspend the execution of the sentence. After the trial Feilding's rakish lifestyle was satirized in a number of publications, most notably in the &#145;History of Orlando the Fair&#146; printed in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span> in August 1709. Feilding was ultimately reconciled with Mary Wadsworth, with whom he lived at Scotland Yard until his death from fever on 12 May 1712 aged sixty-one. He left her the bulk of his property, including estates at Lutterworth, Leicestershire, in his will.<br>
