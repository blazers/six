<span class="headword">Clarke,  Thomas James <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1858&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Fenian organizer</span>, was born on 11 March 1858 at Hurst Park on the Isle of Wight, first of four children of Sergeant James Clarke of the British army (1830&#150;<i>c</i>.1890) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer. His father was a member of the Church of Ireland, his mother a Roman Catholic, in which religion he was raised. Sergeant Clarke was transferred to South Africa in 1859; he returned to Dungannon, co. Tyrone, in 1865 and retired from the army in 1868. Thomas attended St Patrick's national school in Dungannon. A challenge to his father's values, together with sectarian tensions in that part of Ulster, would appear to explain Clarke's youthful espousal of Fenianism.<br>
<br>Clarke emigrated to the United States in 1880, becoming employed as a hotel porter in Brooklyn and joining the Napper Tandy branch of the Clan na Gael. He recrossed the Atlantic on a dynamiting mission in 1883 with the assumed name of Henry Hammond Wilson. An informer caused Clarke's arrest in possession of explosive material in London on 4 April 1883; he was sentenced at the Old Bailey on 14 June to penal servitude for life. Internment was in the harshest of conditions in Millbank, Chatham, and Portland gaols, experiences described in his posthumously published <span class="italic">Glimpses of an Irish Felon's Prison Life</span> (1922). He was released in 1898; unemployment forced his return to the United States in 1899, where he worked as a pattern maker before becoming secretary to the veteran physical force nationalist and journalist John Devoy. Clarke married John Daly's niece Kathleen (1878&#150;1972) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55444/', "Clarke, Kathleen")</script>] on 16 July 1901 in New York. The couple had three sons: John Daly, Thomas, and Emmet. When Devoy established the exile nationalist newspaper the <span class="italic">Gaelic American</span> in 1903, Clarke became assistant editor. A key figure in both public and secret Irish-American ranks, Clarke was heavily involved in resistance to the rumoured Anglo-American alliance. He became a US citizen in 1905. With the backing of the Clan na Gael he returned to Dublin in 1907 where he ran two newsagent/tobacconist shops in Amiens Street and Parnell Street.<br>
<br>Clarke's arrival in Dublin followed soon after the revival of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB); he allied himself with Denis McCullough, Sean McDermott, and Bulmer Hobson in their battle against its ineffective, aged leadership. He was instrumental in the establishment of the organization's newspaper, <span class="italic">Irish Freedom</span>, and promoted the rise of Patrick Pearse to advanced nationalist prominence. The Parnell Street shop became the informal meeting-place for visiting Fenians even though it was known to the police. For Clarke the Ulster crisis and the founding of the Irish Volunteers in November 1913 provided a great opportunity to realize his separatist aims. In a letter of 14 May 1914 he told Devoy:<blockquote>Young fellows who had been regarded as something like wastrels now changed to energetic soldiers and absorbed in the work, and taking pride that at last they feel they can do something for their country that will count. 'Tis good to be alive in Ireland these times. (O'Brien and Ryan, 2.444&#150;6)</blockquote>Clarke opposed fiercely John Redmond's takeover of the Irish Volunteer provisional committee in June 1914; he soon welcomed enthusiastically, however, the opportunity for physical force republicanism that the outbreak of the First World War offered.<br>
<br>Elected a member of the IRB's supreme council in 1913, and of its military council in 1915, Clarke was the most important link with the USA in the planning of the Easter rising. He organized the huge funeral in July&#150;August 1915 of the old dynamiter Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa. Clarke was the only member of the military council who opposed a day's postponement to the rising from Easter Sunday following the collapse of the German arms landing and Eoin MacNeill's cancellation of the Volunteer parade. He was based in the General Post Office throughout the rising, and opposed the decision to surrender. Subsequently he was cruelly treated by British forces.<br>
<br>Clarke was the first signatory to the proclamation of the Irish republic read out by Pearse on Easter Monday. He was one of the first three rebels to be executed in Kilmainham gaol on 3 May 1916; his brother-in-law, Ned Daly, was executed the next day.<br>
<br>Along with Devoy, Clarke represented the long-term personification of the Fenian tradition in Ireland and America, never wavering from a belief in physical force republicanism. Although a supporter of cultural nationalism, he did not speak Irish. His legacy was preserved by his indomitable wife, Kathleen, who became an independent Fianna F&aacute;il senator and served as lord mayor of Dublin (1939&#150;41).<br>
<br>A thin, pale man with a trim moustache, Clarke was prematurely aged by his prison experiences. He was inflexible, disciplined, and taciturn, and remains a somewhat shadowy figure. Kathleen frequently complained that Pearse was given the attention in accounts of the rising that her husband merited.<br>
