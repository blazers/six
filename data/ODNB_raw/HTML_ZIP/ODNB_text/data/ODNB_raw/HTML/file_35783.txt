<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robertson,  John Mackinnon</span>  (1856&#150;1933), <span class="occ">author and politician</span>, was born on 14 November 1856 at Brodick, Isle of Arran, the second son of John Robertson of Perthshire and his wife, Susan, daughter of John Mackinnon of Brodick. His family moved to Stirling, where he left school at the age of thirteen. He became a railway telegraph clerk and, moving to Edinburgh, a law clerk for four years. While working for an insurance company, he began a lifetime's career in journalism, writing for local newspapers, and in 1878 he succeeded William Archer (on Archer's recommendation) as leader writer for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening News</span>. In that year he came under the influence of the radical freethinker Charles Bradlaugh and, after being active in the Edinburgh Secular Society, accepted Bradlaugh's invitation to join him in London as assistant editor of the <span class="italic">National Reformer</span>. When Bradlaugh died, Robertson became editor until the publication failed in 1893, when he founded the <span class="italic">Free Review</span>, which he edited until 1895. In 1893 he married Maude Mosher, daughter of Charles Mosher of Des Moines, Iowa, USA; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>During the late 1880s and the 1890s Robertson extended his interests beyond atheism, free thought, and neo-Malthusianism and became increasingly involved with radical and ethical causes, establishing himself as an effective and sought-after public speaker, and espousing &#145;socialist&#146; ideas at a time when socialism generally signified a belief in the redistribution of wealth, a recognition of social interdependence, and the harnessing of the state to the cause of social reform. He was associated with many of the groups and movements active in moulding progressive secular politics. One of them was South Place Ethical Society, where he was a member of the Sunday lecturers' team from 1899 until the 1920s, an office interrupted only by his political duties. Another was the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47827', "Rainbow Circle")</script>, a society for leading progressive thinkers and politicians, of which Robertson was a member from 1899 to 1931 and where, as his friend J. A. Hobson noted, he impressed his colleagues with his &#145;brilliant debating&#146;. These experiences facilitated Robertson's attachment to the rising new Liberalism and he endorsed its collectivist politics as a means of furthering social justice and reason in politics. His <span class="italic">The Meaning of Liberalism</span> was one of the major new Liberal statements, inviting an evolutionary approach to the regulation of social evils and presenting society as a network of reciprocal obligations, while cautiously attempting to strike a balance between state intervention and private initiative. At heart, however, Robertson was an individualist and remained committed to some of the older Liberal causes. He fought hard against protectionism and his <span class="italic">Trade and Tariffs</span> became a bible for free-traders pursuing the case for cheap food and the expansion of trade. He was also sceptical about the increasing demands emanating from the trade union movement and about the feasibility of socialist proposals.<br>
<br>In 1895 Robertson began his active political life by standing as an independent radical parliamentary candidate for Northampton, a seat he failed to win. He conducted a lecturing tour of the USA in 1897&#150;8 and in 1900 was sent by the <span class="italic">Morning Leader</span> to South Africa, where he reported on the effects of martial law in Cape Colony and Natal over the signature Scrutator. A strong opponent of the South African War, he was a vigorous anti-imperialist and condemned British policy in Egypt (which he visited in 1907), and in India. In 1906 Robertson was elected as Liberal MP for the Tyneside division, a seat he held, with increased majorities, until 1918. Although politics was never his prime interest, and he was handicapped by his noted unwillingness to compromise on matters of principle, he was a trenchant, if not exhilarating, speaker and an able, if not outstanding, politician. In 1911 he became parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, having to relinquish his post in 1915 upon the formation of Asquith's coalition government. In the same year he was sworn of the privy council. From 1915 to 1927 Robertson was chairman of the Liberal publications department, and he also served as president of the National Liberal Federation. In the 1923 elections he unsuccessfully contested Hendon. In his final years, alienated from political developments both institutionally&#151;as an Asquithian Liberal&#151;and ideologically&#151;because he refused to follow many new Liberal colleagues in what they saw as a natural progression towards Labour Party politics&#151;he returned to the pursuit of his formidable intellectual concerns.<br>
<br>Robertson was a self-taught man, of whom H. J. Laski wrote: &#145;I doubt whether there was a more learned man &hellip; in Great Britain&#146;. He acquired a working knowledge of six languages and made original and incisive contributions to an unusually wide range of disciplines. An eminent historian of free thought, he also earned distinction (as well as notoriety) as a Shakespearian scholar, promoting a &#145;scientific&#146; and &#145;disintegrative&#146; textual analysis. He contributed to comparative historical sociology and subjected Christianity to searching secular assessments. In economics he produced, independently of Hobson, an unorthodox under-consumptionist theory which attacked over-saving. He engaged in extensive literary criticism, and his studies of H. T. Buckle and of nineteenth-century humanists accompanied works on population, and on early modern theorists and philosophers, as well as current polemics on Joseph Chamberlain and Lloyd George. Robertson was immensely prolific, working ten to twelve hours, seven days a week, and was blessed with a powerfully retentive memory. He wrote over a hundred books and pamphlets and the number of his articles ran into four figures. At the time of his death his library contained some 12,000 books, the collecting of which was his only extravagance.<br>
<br>Robertson was an avowed rationalist and combative seeker of truth, scrupulously honest, who courted controversy and was often content to plough his own furrow at the expense of popularity and academic recognition. He could be abrasive and austere, applying his reasoning powers to make short shrift of opponents, and his wit was caustic. Yet he was entirely without vanity, possessed charm, and was generous to his friends and devoted to his family. He was good-looking, tall and spare, bearded with a long oval face, and a smart dresser in his youth. He died of a stroke on 5 January 1933 at his London home, 24 Pembroke Gardens, South Kensington, and was cremated without a service at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
