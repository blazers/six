<span class="headword">Boase,  Charles William</span>  (1828&#150;1895), <span class="occ">historian and antiquary</span>, born in Chapel Street, Penzance, on 6 July 1828, was the eldest child of John Josias Arthur Boase JP (1801&#150;1896) and Charlotte (1802&#150;1873), second daughter of Robert Sholl of Truro, who had married at St Clement, near Truro, on 4 July 1827  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 12 Sept 1896, 9). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2736/', "George Clement Boase (1829&#150;1897)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37202/', "Frederic Boase (1843&#150;1916)")</script> were younger brothers.<br>
<br>Charles Boase was sent to Penzance grammar school to 1841, and to Truro grammar school from that date to 1846. At Truro he gained several medals and prizes, and during four years (1846&#150;9) he held from it an Elliot scholarship at Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 4 June 1846. From 1847 to 1850 he combined with it an open scholarship at his college, and on 18 May 1850 he graduated BA with a second class in classics. He was elected to a Cornish fellowship on 30 June 1850, proceeded MA in 1853, and was ordained deacon at Cuddesdon by Bishop Wilberforce on 4 March 1855.<br>
<br>From the day of his matriculation to that of his death Boase lived at Exeter College. He witnessed its rebuilding, and took an especial interest in the construction and fitting of its library buildings. He was assistant tutor 1853&#150;5, tutor 1855&#150;84, lecturer in Hebrew 1859&#150;69, lecturer in modern history 1855&#150;94, and librarian from 1868. Between 1857 and 1875 he examined in various schools, and he was appointed in 1884 the university reader in foreign history. He resigned this last appointment and his college lectureship in modern history (which he held for nearly forty years) in the summer of 1894, but retained the place of librarian. He died in his rooms at Exeter College on 11 March 1895, and was buried in St Sepulchre's cemetery, Oxford, on 13 March.<br>
<br>Boase had acquired vast stores of knowledge, which were given ungrudgingly to others, and was endowed with much quiet humour. He had long studied the history of Exeter College and its alumni, and in 1879 two hundred copies were printed for private circulation of his annotated <span class="italic">Register of the Rectors, Fellows, Scholars &hellip; of Exeter College</span>, with a historical introduction. A second edition, but without the introduction, came out in 1893&#150;4, and a third edition, with the introduction revised and greatly expanded, forms volume 27 of the publications of the Oxford Historical Society, the cost of the printing, a sum exceeding &pound;200, being defrayed by the author. The second part of the college register, containing a similar list of the commoners, being &#145;all names other than those in the previous volume&#146;, was issued by him in 1894. He contributed the article on Exeter College to Andrew Clark's <span class="italic">Colleges of Oxford</span>.<br>
<br>On the formation of the Oxford Historical Society in 1884 Boase was one of the honorary secretaries, and he acted on the committee to 1 June 1892. Much of its success was due to his judgement and energy, and its first publication consisted of the <span class="italic">Register of the University of Oxford, 1449&#150;63, 1505&#150;71</span> (1885&#150;9), which he compiled and edited. He also wrote the preface to J. E. T. Rogers's <span class="italic">Oxford City Documents &hellip; 1268&#150;1665</span>, which the society issued in 1891. <span class="italic">Oxford</span>, published by Longmans as part of their <span class="roman">Historic Towns</span> series in 1887, was written by Boase, but much of the information which he had collected was omitted.<br>
<br>Boase edited, with G. W. Kitchin (afterwards dean of Durham), the <span class="italic">History of England</span>, the translation in six volumes of the work by Leopold von Ranke, published in 1895, and was entirely responsible for the rendering of the first volume. In conjunction with his two brothers he compiled an <span class="italic">Account of the Families of Boase or Bowes</span>, tracing his ancestors back in west Cornwall to the end of the sixteenth century (1876; 2nd edn, 1893). He contributed to the <span class="italic">Literary Churchman</span>, <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, and <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, wrote the article on the Macedonian empire in the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (9th edn), and the lives of the Cornish saints in W. Smith and H. Wace, <span class="italic">Dictionary of Christian Biography</span> (1877&#150;87). An account of the deeds and writs (1306&#150;1836) in the Dawson collection was compiled by him for the <span class="italic">Catalogue of &hellip; Penzance Public Library</span> (1874; pp. 336&#150;43).<br>
<br>Boase was a noted bibliophile and the possessor of large collections of Cornish genealogies. The bulk of his library, of which he kept a full record, was catalogued and sold by Blackwells booksellers after his death. Some of the most valuable items, however, passed to his college, including a now famous fourteenth-century manuscript of Suetonius' <span class="italic">Twelve Caesars</span>, later recognized to have been owned and annotated by Petrarch. His own working methods were somewhat disorderly, and the books which he wrote are often inadequately referenced by modern standards. His main claim to fame, beyond his local distinction as the historian of Exeter College, lies in his position as a mainstay of the Oxford history school during the decades of its first flourishing. As his surviving tutorial notebooks testify, he taught widely and conscientiously, though without any great originality of mind, and he was a popular figure in his college and university:<blockquote>He had a quick way of talking, altogether without the least air of pretension or even consciousness that he was pouring forth an amount of knowledge, skilfully and humorously compounded, which would have made the reputation of many a professed conversationalist &hellip; His friends will speak of his geniality, his cheery good nature, his unfailing kindness, which in a moment made children feel at home with the most human of old bachelors. (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>)</blockquote>
