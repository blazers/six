<span class="headword">Herbert,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>William Herbert Wilderspin]</span>  (1772&#150;1851), <span class="occ">antiquary and librarian</span>, was born William Herbert Wilderspin on 18 May 1772 at Worship Street, Curtain Road, Shoreditch, London, the only son of John Wilderspin (<i>c</i>.1717&#150;1781), clockmaker and smith, and his third wife, Elizabeth (Kirby?), who died <i>c</i>.1800. They had six children: William's two elder sisters died in childhood. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29404/', "Samuel Wilderspin (1791&#150;1866)")</script>, the promoter of the infant school system, was the son of his stepbrother. The name Herbert came from a godfather; and by the time of his marriage William had ceased to use his father's surname. His memoirs give a vivid description of his early life and work in the theatre. His father died in an accident in 1781, leaving the family in poverty. William earned money by working in the households of such men as the Revd John Newton, a leading evangelical minister and friend of Cowper, and especially by reading to them. He attended briefly a school run by a Baptist clergyman, Thomas Mabbott, and was taught languages, literature, and religious studies by his patrons and associates. He studied palaeography, law Latin, and Norman French while apprenticed to a law stationer, worked for several London solicitors, and developed an interest in London history.<br>
<br>Herbert married Sarah Youens, a professional singer, on 14 July 1795 and they were both engaged to perform at the Bermondsey Spa Gardens in that year. Between 1795 and 1801 they were employed at the Royal Circus, St George's Fields, London, William as an actor of melodrama and singer of popular ballads. From 1796 they lived at numerous addresses in Lambeth, the longest stay being probably at Globe Place, Westminster Bridge Road, near the Marsh Gate (<i>c</i>.1805&#150;1810). They are known to have had two daughters and three sons between 1796 and 1812. In 1801 William became a reader at the Lyceum for the unsuccessful spectacle <span class="italic">Egyptiana</span>, and then gave up the theatre except for part-time work as a prompter at the New Royal Circus between 1806 and 1812. His wife carried on as a singer with greater success.<br>
<br>After 1801 Herbert concentrated on researching and writing London history and, until about 1815, selling books and prints. His earliest published work was a contribution to Longman's <span class="italic">Annual Review</span> (1802). Between 1803 and 1805 he worked for the publishers Vernor and Hood compiling a miscellany with Edward Wedlake Brayley, <span class="italic">Syr Reginalde, or, The Black Tower</span> (1803), editing Thomas Thornton's <span class="italic">Sporting Tour through the North Part of England</span> (1804), and writing his first substantial book&#151;<span class="italic">Antiquities of the Inns of Court and Chancery</span> (1804)&#151;and the descriptions to accompany Storer and Grieg's <span class="italic">Select Views of London and its Environs</span> (1804&#150;5). He collaborated again with Brayley to publish <span class="italic">A Concise Account &hellip; of Lambeth Palace</span> (1806), which John Britton said was written mostly by Brayley. Aiming at the vogue for prints to extra-illustrate popular topographical works, in 1808 Herbert launched the first number of his own publication, a series of engraved copies of old illustrations of London under the title <span class="italic">Londina illustrata</span>. The next five numbers were published with Robert Wilkinson, who continued the series alone, adding contemporary views. In 1817&#150;18 Herbert returned to his original scheme with a grandiose and unsuccessful series of prints, <span class="italic">London before the Great Fire</span>, which failed after the second number.<br>
<br>Herbert gave up his bookselling business to concentrate on historical research and writing, sometimes for others who failed to acknowledge his work. He claimed that he wrote most of John Parton's <span class="italic">Some Account of the Hospital and Parish of St. Giles in the Fields, Middlesex</span> (1822), and Charles Dawson said that he wrote the text of <span class="italic">History &hellip; of Hastings</span> (1824), credited to the book's illustrator, William George Moss. Through the bookseller Thomas Thorpe, Herbert was employed to study Lord Chichester's archives relating to his land at Hastings (1821&#150;3); he conducted excavations of Hastings Castle in 1824 and compiled an illustrated account which was extensively used by Dawson for his <span class="italic">History of Hastings Castle</span> (1909).<br>
<br>In 1828, at the age of fifty-six, Herbert acquired a salaried post to which he was admirably suited, on the recommendation of the antiquary William Upcott. He was appointed first librarian of the City of London's Guildhall Library. Primarily concerned with building up the collections on London, he increased the library's stock from about 1700 books to over 10,000, adding numerous prints and drawings, some miscellaneous antiquities, and manuscripts including one of the most notable purchases, the deed signed by William Shakespeare. While librarian, Herbert compiled the catalogue of 1840 and its 1842 supplement, wrote <span class="italic">The Illustrations of the Site and Neighbourhood of the New Post Office</span> (1830), <span class="italic">The History &hellip; of St. Michael Crooked Lane</span> (1832), and his best-known work, <span class="italic">History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies of London</span> (1836&#150;7). His memories of the Paternoster Row booksellers were published in W. Pinnock's <span class="italic">Guide to Knowledge</span> (1834). He resigned through ill health in 1845.<br>
<br>Herbert died of a strangulated hernia on 18 November 1851 at 40 Brunswick Street, Haggerston, Middlesex. His death was reported by his granddaughter Eliza, and he was buried at Nunhead cemetery on 23 November. His <span class="italic">School Education, or, The Young Academical Orator</span> was published posthumously in 1853.<br>
