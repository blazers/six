<span class="headword">Torrens, Sir  Robert Richard Chute</span>  (1812&#150;1884), <span class="occ">land reformer</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27565/', "Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Torrens (1780?&#150;1864)")</script> and his first wife, Charity Herbert Chute. He was born in Cork on 31 May 1812, educated at Trinity College, Dublin (BA, 1835), and became a customs officer. On 19 February 1839, at St James's Church, Westminster, he married Barbara Ainslie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Parks, the widow of George Augustus Anson. In 1840 they emigrated to South Australia, where he became collector of customs at &pound;350 a year and built a handsome house, St Clair, at Woodville. Successive governors of the colony repeatedly censured him for irregularities, but he was answerable only to the customs board in London, which rebuked but did not displace him. While his quarrelsome, sometimes violent, behaviour and his land speculations throughout Australasia made him despised as a rogue and swindler, by 1850 he had a bank balance of &pound;18,000.<br>
<br>Appointed a legislative councillor in 1851 and colonial treasurer in 1852, Torrens emerged as the most reactionary of the colony's legislators. After building the mansion Torrens Park (later Scotch College) at Mitcham, he was so disgusted by the introduction of manhood suffrage, the ballot, and an elected upper house when a new constitution was adopted in 1855&#150;6 that he decided to quit the colony. He found, however, that he could not sell his land because so many of his deeds were of dubious validity. So in 1857 (in which year he briefly acted as premier, from 1 to 30 September) he joined a twenty-year-old crusade to simplify, cheapen, and expedite all dealings in land, by introducing the registration of titles, and won election to the house of assembly promising to champion that cause. Several colonists had drafted bills to implement the reform. Torrens took up one of these, the handiwork of a German immigrant, Dr Ulrich H&uuml;bbe, who had modelled it on the system operating in the Hanseatic cities. Torrens effectively countered criticisms from lawyers fearing a loss of income and secured the bills' enactment in January 1858. He then resigned from parliament to become registrar-general, with a salary of &pound;1000. He incurred fresh censures because his continued land-jobbing seemed inappropriate now that he could definitively determine ownership disputes. When he travelled to other colonies badgering their parliaments to copy the <span class="roman">Real Property Act</span>, members of the Adelaide chamber of commerce claimed he was doing so to make his own bad titles indefeasible.<br>
<br>Having realized his Australasian assets, Torrens returned to England in 1862 and undertook lecture tours advocating land-title reform. After two unsuccessful attempts he was elected MP for Cambridge in 1868, but he won little support for the registration of land titles in Britain. He lost his seat in 1874. At his country home, Hannaford, near Ashburton, Devon, he engaged in ceaseless self-promotion and fruitless attempts to secure a pension from the South Australian parliament. Despite a warning from Governor Sir Dominick Daly in Adelaide that he had been &#145;the occasion of much mischief in this community and honours conferred on him would certainly not give general satisfaction&#146;  (Adelaide, State Records Office, GRG 2/14/1/30&#150;31), Torrens was appointed KCMG in 1872 and GCMG in 1884. He died, of pneumonia, at Falmouth, Cornwall, on a journey from the Isles of Scilly, on 31 August 1884 and was buried in Leusdon churchyard, Devon. His wife died in 1899 and was interred with him. They had no children.<br>
<br>In a series of pamphlets explaining the South Australian system of conveyancing by registration of title, Torrens claimed to be the originator of the reform. This influenced his first biographers and writers of legal textbooks. South Australians, knowing that some twenty other people had prepared the way, long before Torrens became interested, and had helped to get H&uuml;bbe's bill enacted, for more than a century insisted on speaking of their &#145;<span class="roman">Real Property Act</span> titles&#146;. Wherever the legislation was copied, the terms &#145;<span class="roman">Torrens Act</span>&#146; and &#145;Torrens titles&#146; were prevalent from the beginning. Since the 1970s those usages have gained general currency in South Australia too.<br>
