<span class="headword">Loring, Sir  Neil <span class="st"> [Nigel]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1315&#150;1386), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of Roger Loring of Chalgrave, Bedfordshire, and Cassandra, daughter of Reginald Perot. The family seems to have been established there since the twelfth century, and Sir Piers Loring served in Edward I's Scottish wars. His mother's family were also from Bedfordshire. Loring apparently entered the royal service at an early age. On 6 October 1335 he was granted a pension of 100<i>s</i>., and had further grants from the king on 24 September 1338 and in 1339. He married Margaret, daughter and heir of Ralph Beauple of Cnubeston, Devon, with whom he had two daughters. Isabel, the elder, married first William Coggan, and second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61171/', "Robert Harrington, third Baron Harrington")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54525/', "Harrington family")</script>]; her tomb is in Porlock church, Somerset. Margaret, Loring's younger daughter, married Thomas Peyvre of Toddington, Bedfordshire.<br>
<br>Loring fought with distinction at the battle of Sluys on 24 June 1340, and was rewarded with the honour of knighthood and a pension of &pound;20 yearly. In 1342 he served in Brittany under Sir Walter Mauny. On 23 February 1345 he went with Michael Northburgh on a mission to the pope to obtain a dispensation for the marriage of the prince of Wales with a daughter of the duke of Brabant. Later in this and in the following year he served under Henry, earl of Derby, in Aquitaine; a grant of 12 November 1346 implies that he was still with the earl following the latter's raid into Poitou and Saintonge during the autumn. Unlike most founder knights of the Garter he almost certainly did not fight at Cr&eacute;cy, but he was in the king's retinue at Calais in 1347, with three esquires and a hobelar. When the Order of the Garter was instituted in 1348&#150;9 Loring was one of the original knights, occupying the tenth stall on the prince's side [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92770', "Founding knights of the Order of the Garter")</script>]. On 16 December 1350 he was one of the commissioners appointed to treat concerning the payments due to the king for the government of the Low Countries. By 1351 he had become chamberlain to the prince of Wales and a member of his council. He accompanied the prince to Aquitaine in 1353, and served in the campaign of Poitiers in 1356, distinguishing himself in the skirmish before Romorantin on 29 August. After the battle on 19 September, during which he was &#145;appointed to be in attendance on the prince's person&#146;, he was sent home to England with the news of the victory. Like many other members of the prince's retinue he was handsomely rewarded for his service, being given a pension of &pound;83 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for life, as well as lands in Wales. In November 1359 Loring accompanied the king on his expedition into France, which was followed by the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny on 25 May 1360. He was one of the guardians of the truce on 7 May, and was one of the commissioners appointed to supervise the transfer of lands and redress any violations.<br>
<br>In July 1362 Loring went out to Aquitaine to prepare for the arrival of the prince of Wales later that summer. He was one of the four knights whom the prince sent to England in 1366 to obtain the king's opinion on the Spanish expedition, but returned to France in time to join the army at the beginning of the following year. At the battle of N&aacute;jera on 3 April he fought in the prince's division. Loring was one of the knights whom the prince dispatched at the end of June from Valladolid to Seville in order to urge Pedro the Cruel of Castile to send the assistance he had promised. In 1369 he served under Sir Robert Knolles on his expedition into the Agenais, at the siege of Domme, and in the following year, under John Hastings, earl of Pembroke, in Poitou.<br>
<br>Loring returned to England and took up residence on his ancestral estate at Chalgrave, where, in 1365, he had obtained leave to enclose a park. He died on 18 March 1386, and was buried in Dunstable Priory church, of which he was a benefactor. Loring also founded a chantry in Chalgrave church, and contributed to building the cloister at St Albans. He made a large number of legacies to religious foundations, including the friars at Truro, Bodmin, and Plymouth, reflecting the places where he had worked in the prince's service. He left his daughters a gold circlet valued at &pound;40 and 2367 &#145;great marguerite pearls&#146; to be divided between them. There is a miniature representing him in his robes as a knight of the Garter in BL, Cotton MS Nero D.vii, fol. 105<i>v</i>.<br>
