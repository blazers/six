<span class="headword">Herbert,  William</span>, styled first marquess of Powis and Jacobite first duke of Powis  (<em>c.</em>1626&#150;1696), <span class="occ">Jacobite courtier</span>, was the only son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68255/', "Percy Herbert, second Baron Powis (1598&#150;1667)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1600, <i>d</i>. 1662), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6635/', "Sir William Craven (c.1545&#150;1618)")</script>, sometime lord mayor of London. He was educated privately in his youth, possibly at home at Powis Castle. The Herbert family were Roman Catholics who espoused the royalist cause during the civil war; some of their estates were subsequently confiscated and others were sold to pay parliamentary fines levied against them. Lord Powis received scant reward for his services following the Restoration, but his son eventually gained the favour of Charles II. He succeeded to his father's title on 19 January 1667 and on 4 April 1674 received an earldom. His religion, however, debarred him from a very active place in politics. Although he owned large estates in Wales and the marches, for example, he held no office&#151;even that of justice of the peace&#151;during Charles II's reign. As one of a handful of Roman Catholic peers, and among the highest-ranking, Powis was from the beginning a target of the manufacturers of the Popish Plot. According to Titus Oates, the pope intended Powis to be lord treasurer of the government that would seize power after the king's assassination. He was also accused of planning to restore the monasteries and to subject England to papal domination. Parliament impeached him and four other Catholic lords, and on 25 October 1678 all five went to the Tower, where Powis would remain until February 1684, although his confinement did not prevent him from attacking his opponents. In May 1679 an armed mob invaded his London home at midnight, searching for Roman Catholic traitors.<br>
<br>Powis seems to have been the author of <span class="italic">Some Reflections upon the Earl of Danby, in Relation to the Murther of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey</span>. Danby, he argued, wanted Godfrey dead because he feared that his own role in the Popish Plot might be revealed. The theory was far fetched, but no more so than the one peddled by Oates. Printed by a London Catholic bookseller in 1679 and distributed clandestinely, the pamphlet accused Danby of orchestrating the murder. Powis's wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1633&#150;1691), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26006/', "Edward Somerset, second marquess of Worcester (d. 1667)")</script>, whom he had married in July 1654, joined in her husband's defence. She too was Catholic, and she published a ballad denouncing the plot:<blockquote>
<div>The Presbyter has bin so active of late<br>
</div>
<div>To twist himself into the Mysteries of State,<br>
</div>
<div>Giving birth to a Plot to amuse the dark world.<br>
</div> (E. Herbert, 1)</blockquote>More significantly, she inflamed popular opinion against her husband and his co-religionists even further with an ill-advised attempt to invent a rival &#145;Presbyterian Plot&#146;. The so-called Meal-Tub Plot, hatched in conjunction with a Catholic midwife named Elizabeth Cellier, backfired. The two women approached Thomas Dangerfield, hoping he would accuse Shaftesbury and his allies of an assassination conspiracy against Charles II and the duke of York. But while the kingdom was perfectly prepared to believe in a popish plot, a presbyterian one was a different matter. When Dangerfield realized that his &#145;evidence&#146; against Shaftesbury was going nowhere, he turned upon his erstwhile employers. He accused them of plotting Shaftesbury's murder, as well as of concocting their fictional &#145;plot&#146;. The countess joined her husband in the Tower on 4 November 1679. Charged with treason, she remained in prison until granted bail on 12 February 1680. In May, sceptical of the evidence presented against her, the Middlesex grand jury refused to indict and she was released. Although parliamentary proceedings against her husband petered out in the same year, not until February 1684 was Powis granted bail, with the dukes of Norfolk and Beaufort, and the earls of Pembroke and Peterborough as sureties. A few months later in October, his troubles increased when his Lincoln's Inn Fields house burnt down. He and his family barely escaped the conflagration, although two page boys were said to have died.<br>
<br>James II's accession reversed Powis's fortunes. In May 1685 parliament formally withdrew his impeachment, and in June 1685 the king assented to a private bill allowing him to rebuild Powis House. More concrete rewards followed. In March 1686 the king granted him a dispensation from the provisions of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, and in July named him to the privy council. In March 1687 he advanced a step in the peerage, becoming marquess of Powis. James also gave him command of a regiment of foot. Though inexperienced in government, the king gave Powis a great deal of responsibility. He became lord lieutenant of Cheshire and the city of Chester, and deputy lieutenant of Sussex in February 1687. He played an important part in the campaign to regulate the corporations, both as steward and recorder of Denbigh and steward of Shrewsbury, and as a member of the commission which oversaw the wider purge of local government. In June 1688 James made the marchioness his son's governess.<br>
<br>Powis exercised a moderating influence in James's counsels. He had already gained a reputation for tolerance, acting as a patron to Quakers in trouble with the law. He hoped to limit the enthusiasm of the more headstrong Catholics around the king such as Father Petre and the earl of Tyrconnell, but had little success. When regulating the corporations, he spoke out against the bullying tactics of some of his fellow commissioners. The earl of Ailesbury said that he urged James to name Powis lord lieutenant of Ireland instead of Tyrconnell, a suggestion the king rejected, alleging that Powis had &#145;a very weak head&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.148). Weak-headed or not, Powis remained conspicuously loyal to James. His prominence insured that in the revolution he would again be the target of the mob, and in December 1688 Powis House narrowly escaped demolition thanks to the intervention of the militia.<br>
<br>Powis accompanied his master to St Germain in late 1688, and on 12 January 1689 <span class="smallcap">OS</span> James granted him a dukedom, which was never recognized in England. He headed the list of Jacobites whom parliament planned to attaint for treason in the summer of 1689. Although this bill never passed, in February 1690 he was outlawed and his lands seized. Some of these went to William III's Dutch favourite, the earl of Rochford, including the family seat Powis Castle. Powis House went to Lord Somers. The marquess's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13061/', "William Herbert, Viscount Montgomery (later second marquess of Powis and Jacobite second duke of Powis) (1657x61&#150;1745)")</script>, was gaoled in the Tower as a Jacobite and fought a long battle in the courts to retain some of his property, resulting in the restoration of his family's estates and the marquessate in 1722.<br>
<br>In 1690 Powis landed in Ireland with James, where he acted as one of his principal advisers. James appointed him to his Irish privy council and made him lord chamberlain. He remained in Ireland until the king's flight back to France after the battle of the Boyne, and settled again at St Germain. Powis was a prominent figure in the Jacobite court, serving as lord steward and lord chamberlain of the household, but he seems to have been rather marginal in the king's counsels. The marchioness continued as royal governess until her death on 11 March 1691 <span class="smallcap">OS</span>, and James made Powis knight of the Garter in April 1692. Nevertheless others exercised more influence at court as Powis struggled to maintain the dignity of a royal household on an insufficient income. Having lost estates valued at &pound;10,000 a year, he had given up more than most for the Jacobite cause. He died, aged about seventy, on 12 July 1696 <span class="smallcap">NS</span>, after a riding accident in St Germain, and was buried there the next day. His son William succeeded to his titles. His daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13039/', "Lady Lucy Herbert")</script> followed her parents' religious bent and became the prioress of St Augustine, Bruges.<br>
