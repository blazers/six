<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stead,  Christina Ellen</span>  (1902&#150;1983), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 17 July 1902 in Sydney, Australia, the daughter of David George Stead (1877&#150;1957), naturalist, and Ellen Butters (1876&#150;1904). Her mother died two years after her birth, and her father married again in 1907. His second wife, Ada Gibbons Stead, bore six more children. In 1917, in straitened circumstances, the family moved to Watson's Bay, Sydney, then a modest fishing village perched between the Pacific Ocean and Sydney harbour. Stead's autobiographical novel, <span class="italic">The Man who Loved Children</span> (1940), gives a vivid impression of the tensions of her early childhood and her escape into writing. Sam Pollit (the &#145;man&#146; referred to in the title) is closely based on Stead's father: a self-educated naturalist and gifted story-teller. He was an overbearing, charming, manipulative man who constantly taunted his eldest daughter that she was too plain to find a husband. Stead battled internally all her life with the ghost of her father.<br>
<br>Christina Stead did well at Sydney Girls' High School; in her final year, 1919, she was editor of the school magazine. She attended Sydney Teachers' College (1920&#150;22), where she developed a strong interest in psychology, but she hated teaching. In 1925, on the brink of a nervous breakdown, she left the New South Wales department of education. In the same year Angus and Robertson, Australia's major publishing house, rejected her children's stories. For the next three years, though her wages as a secretary were meagre, Stead obsessively saved for the boat fare to Europe. Determined to become a writer, she felt the pull of the world's cultural centres.<br>
<br>Stead sailed to London in March 1928 and found work as a secretary in a firm of grain merchants. Her American manager, William James Blech (1894&#150;1968), who later changed his name to Blake, became her lifelong, supportive companion; they eventually were to marry on 23 February 1952. A Marxist and financier, he later wrote historical fiction.<br>
<br>In 1929 Stead and Blake went to Paris, where they worked in a private American bank. In her spare time Stead wrote feverishly. She was contracted by the London publisher Peter Davies, and <span class="italic">The Salzburg Tales</span> and <span class="italic">Seven Poor Men of Sydney</span> were both published in 1934. The stories, in particular, received lavish praise from well-known critics in Britain and the United States. Australian critics, steeped in the realist tradition, responded less favourably to the elements of modernist eccentricity in Stead's early fiction. Her next two novels, <span class="italic">The Beauties and Furies</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">House of All Nations</span> (1938), had Paris settings. Stead's genius for portraying different locales, voices, and expressions make her one of the truly cosmopolitan writers of the twentieth century. In her homeland this meant she was dismissed (until the late 1960s) as &#145;un-Australian&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1937 Stead and Blake moved to New York, where they stayed for the next nine years, moving in communist literary circles. Eager to write about her childhood in Sydney, Stead embarked on <span class="italic">The Man who Loved Children</span>, a psychological character novel of searing intensity. Her publishers, Simon and Schuster, persuaded her to give the novel an American setting. It went entirely against the grain, but Stead transplanted her family narrative to Washington and Chesapeake Bay. Her Australian family members were made into Americans, with American speech and habits&#151;a feat that, according to some American critics, Stead did not manage convincingly. Whether or not the novel for which Stead is best-known is flawed in this way, its American setting has complicated her standing within the Australian literary canon. <span class="italic">For Love Alone</span> (1944) forms an autobiographical sequel, though the writer protagonist (called Louisa in <span class="italic">The Man who Loved Children</span>) is now called Teresa, and this time the setting is Sydney and London. The novel is a bold and courageous evocation of female sexual desire (in a world that permitted no outlet for it) and the terror that the prospect of spinsterhood aroused in young women. The <span class="italic">New York Times</span> compared the novel with D. H. Lawrence's early fiction.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Letty Fox: her Luck</span> (1946), Stead again explored the female condition, from a very different angle. Letty is a sexually promiscuous New Yorker in a sexually liberated world. Once again, Stead explores the sexual, social, and political binds in which her characters are caught up. And once again, the reviews made it obvious that she had touched nerve centres. From the mid-1930s and throughout the 1940s Stead was greatly admired in London and New York literary circles. The American critic Clifton Fadiman hailed her in the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> as &#145;the most extraordinary woman novelist produced by the English-speaking race since Virginia Woolf&#146;  (Fadiman, 84&#150;6). And yet during the 1950s and early 1960s her reputation suffered a complete eclipse. Stead and Blake left the United States at the end of 1946. Already the House Un-American Activities Committee was persecuting left-wing writers and threatening the autonomy of publishing houses. (The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a brief file on Stead in 1947, but there was a substantial file on Blake, who was an active fellow traveller.) For several years they wandered from place to place in Europe, impoverished and receiving rejection slips from publishers. In 1952 they settled in London.<br>
<br>For Stead, the departure from the United States represented a significant turning point. From then on her fiction offered neither moral integrity nor hope. Instead, she confronted readers with poverty, corruption, and self-deception. Apart from <span class="italic">The People with the Dogs</span> (1952), a gentle Chekhovian narrative, her books became angry. <span class="italic">A Little Tea, a Little Chat</span> (1948) was about wartime profiteering by New York financiers. After 1952 there was a publishing gap of thirteen years, and it was thought that Stead had writer's block. In fact, although publishers did not consider her books marketable, she was writing some of her best, most critical fiction: <span class="italic">Cotter's England</span> (1966), <span class="italic">The Puzzleheaded Girl</span> (1967), <span class="italic">Miss Herbert</span> (1976), <span class="italic">The Little Hotel</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">I'm Dying Laughing</span> (published posthumously in 1986). There was a brief resurgence of interest in Stead when <span class="italic">The Man who Loved Children</span> was reissued in 1965, but nevertheless her later novels sank with little trace.<br>
<br>Stead was an uncompromising writer. She was not interested in carefully wrought &#145;literature&#146;; she wanted to disturb, even madden the reader. She aimed, she once said, for &#145;intelligent ferocity&#146;  (Rowley, 316). Her fiction is energetic and furious, with loose threads, open endings, and ambiguous moral messages. Angela Carter, one of her most admiring critics, wrote that reading Stead is &#145;like plunging into the mess of life itself&#146;.<br>
<br>When Bill Blake died in 1968 Stead was bereft. More and more she turned to alcohol for solace. In 1974, frightened by heart problems, she returned to Australia to live. She was f&ecirc;ted now in Australia, and in 1974 she was awarded the Patrick White literary award. But the recognition came too late and Australia no longer felt like home. She died in Sydney on 31 March 1983. Her ashes were scattered on 6 April at the Northern Suburbs crematorium in Sydney.<br>
