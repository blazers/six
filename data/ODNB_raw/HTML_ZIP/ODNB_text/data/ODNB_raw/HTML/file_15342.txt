<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ken,  Thomas</span>  (1637&#150;1711), <span class="occ">bishop of Bath and Wells and nonjuror</span>, was born at Little Berkhamsted in July 1637, the son of Thomas Ken (<i>d</i>. 1651), attorney of Furnival's Inn and clerk of assize in Glamorgan, Radnorshire, and Brecon, and his second wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1641), daughter of the poet John Chalkhill (<i>fl</i>. 1600). After his father's death in 1651 he lived with his half-sister, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1610), whose husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28653/', "Isaak Walton (1593&#150;1683)")</script>, a literary figure of pronounced Laudian views, doubtless had great influence on the young Ken's spiritual and literary development.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Ken was educated at Winchester College, where he was elected scholar on 26 September 1651 and admitted the following January. In autumn 1656 he was elected to New College, Oxford, and he entered there in 1657 after a brief spell at Hart Hall. At Winchester and New College he developed a lifelong friendship with Francis Turner, another future nonjuror. At Oxford he also probably began his association with George Hooper, whose life was to interweave with his and to whom in 1704 he gladly ceded his bishopric of Bath and Wells. New College was deeply permeated with puritanism during the interregnum. It is for this reason that Ken may have joined a group which, led by John Fell, met for Anglican worship at the house of Thomas Willis. Music was a favourite recreation all Ken's life and at Oxford, as a skilful lutenist, he took part in a musical society. He also reportedly gave alms to the poor. He graduated BA on 3 May 1661 and proceeded MA in January 1664. In 1661 and 1662 he was lector in logic, and possibly mathematics, at New College.<br>
<br>After ordination in 1661 or 1662 Ken was instituted on 17 August 1663 into the rectory of Little Easton, Essex, where he was spiritual counsellor to the devout Margaret, Lady Maynard (<i>d</i>. 1682); she seems to have had a lasting spiritual influence on him. Her husband had attended Charles II on his entry into London and served at the coronation, and was to become comptroller of the royal household and a privy councillor in 1672. It was perhaps Ken's intimacy with the Maynards, coupled with Isaak Walton's friendship with Bishop George Morley of Winchester, that brought Ken early promotion. Early in 1665 he resigned his living and moved to Winchester as Morley's chaplain. Living in the close he took unpaid charge of the parish of St John in the Soke, where he frequently preached, and reportedly converted many Anabaptists. In December 1666 he was elected fellow of Winchester, resigning his fellowship at New College, where he gave &pound;103 10<i>s</i>. towards new buildings. On 6 July 1667 Morley instituted him to the rectory of Brighstone, on the Isle of Wight. Here he remained until spring 1669, when he was clearly intended for the rectory of Bishop's Waltham&#151;on 11 April that year Ken subscribed for that living, but was never instituted. Instead, on 28 May he became rector of East Woodhay. In parallel, on 12 April 1669 he became prebendary of Winchester, moving from one prebend to another in May. In autumn 1672 he resigned his living to make way for George Hooper, his fellow chaplain, who moved from Havant, where the damp was affecting his health. Ken now lived in Winchester, fulfilling his duties as cathedral prebendary, college fellow, and bishop's chaplain, and in St John's parish. Music was still an important part of his life; he had an organ of his own, and frequently accompanied himself for morning and evening prayers on the lute. In 1674 he published his <span class="italic">Manual for Winchester Scholars</span>, but without his three hymns added later. In 1675 he went on a tour of Europe with his nephew, Isaac Walton the younger. In Rome, where it was jubilee year, papal grandeur was at its zenith. This was enough to alert him to the imperfections of Rome and to confirm him in his adherence to Anglicanism as the purest form of the church catholic, albeit that on his return some said he was &#145;tinged with popery&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.546). On 6 July 1678 Ken was created BD and on 30 June 1679 DD.<h2>
<a name="TheHagueandTangier"></a>The Hague and Tangier</h2>Late in 1679 Henry Compton, bishop of London, appointed Ken to succeed George Hooper as chaplain to Mary, wife of the future William III. From now onwards Ken was increasingly involved in the turbulent events of the 1680s that engulfed the royal family and the realm. The task at The Hague was not easy, as Hooper had unpleasantly discovered; the chaplain's role was to protect Mary's Anglicanism from William's dour and boorishly combative Calvinism. Ken himself was &#145;horribly unsatisfied with the Prince&#146;, thought he was &#145;not kind to his wife&#146;, and decided to speak to him &#145;though he kicks him out of doors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of &hellip; Sidney</span>, 2.19&#150;20). William's threats prompted Ken to offer his resignation, but Ken's firmness impressed William enough to persuade him to stay. When Compton asked Ken to enquire into the possibility of Anglican union with Dutch protestants, Ken advised against proceeding further, because of the questionable validity of Dutch ordination. Nevertheless, he scored a notable coup in securing the conversion from Catholicism of Colonel Edward Fitzpatrick, a scion of a noble Irish family and nephew of the duke of Ormond. In September 1680 Ken was able to report that Fitzpatrick had received &#145;the Holy Eucharist in our chapel&#146;  (Plumptre, 1.152&#150;3). This conversion at the time of the Popish Plot was doubly significant, for some had suspected Ken himself of harbouring popish sympathies.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1680 Ken was appointed one of the king's chaplains, but continued to live in Winchester. Three years later, in summer 1683, Charles made one of his frequent visits with the royal court to Winchester to oversee the construction of his magnificent new palace. Ken stubbornly refused requests to accommodate the king's mistress, Nell Gwyn, in his prebendal house. Instead she had to stay in the deanery. Charles, typically accepting this rebuff, respected Ken for his views and his boldness; later he reportedly declared &#145;I must go and hear little Ken tell me of my faults&#146;  (Plumptre, 1.159).<br>
<br>Ken's next assignment was to Tangier, granted as a Portuguese marriage dowry to Charles II in 1661. Originally attractive, its possession proved a costly burden, and the government decided to send a taskforce to withdraw the garrison and destroy the fortifications. In August 1683 at short notice Lord Dartmouth, the fleet commander, on Samuel Pepys's advice appointed Ken, a man of &#145;piety, authority and learning&#146;, as senior chaplain of the fleet  (<span class="italic">Life, Journals</span>, 2.149&#150;50). His task included oversight of other chaplains, who were said to be little better than the current decadent state of the navy. Rough weather made the voyage in their ship, the <i>Grafton</i>, long and arduous; it took five weeks, during which Ken was in frequent discussion with Pepys and Dartmouth. In Tangier all three were appalled by its depravity. Pepys himself noted &#145;nothing but vice in the whole place of all sorts, for swearing, cursing, drinking and whoring&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tangier Papers</span>, 89). Ken courageously preached in the Anglican church &#145;particularly in reproof of the vices of this town&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life, Journals</span>, 1.374), sometimes in the presence of officials including the governor, Colonel Percival Kirke, a capable, if brutal, soldier once described as a &#145;foul-mouthed, drunken, bullying sensualist&#146;  (Rice, 59). Dining quietly in Pepys's cabin Ken and Pepys one evening discussed the &#145;viciousness of this place and its being time for God Almighty to destroy it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tangier Papers</span>, 49). On another occasion they had an angry confrontation with Kirke about the &#145;excessive liberty of swearing and blaspheming we observe here&#146;  (ibid., 50). With Kirke as an uncongenial companion they embarked, after long delays, on the return journey on 8 March. This proved extremely hazardous in one of the worst gales for decades. Arriving at Portsmouth in April, six months later than originally intended, they brought with them the Tangier church silver, later given to Portsmouth for use in the parish church, now the cathedral. This prolonged naval episode, unsought and unwelcome as it was, amply demonstrated Ken's devotion to duty and his moral and physical courage in confronting both Tangier's depravity and the terrors of the sea.<h2>
<a name="BishopofBathandWells16851688"></a>Bishop of Bath and Wells, 1685&#150;1688</h2>Ken clearly had so impressed the king and his brother, James, by his work at The Hague and in Tangier that, when in November 1684 the see of Bath and Wells fell vacant, Charles was eager to appoint him. Allegedly Charles declared &#145;Odd's fish! Who shall have Bath and Wells but the little fellow who would not give poor Nelly a lodging&#146;  (Bowles, 2.66). The king pressed to have the processes completed rapidly. Elected by the Wells chapter on 16 December, Ken was consecrated by Sancroft, with Turner as a co-consecrator, at Lambeth on 25 January 1685. When the king fell ill only a few days later, significantly Ken was one of four bishops summoned to his deathbed. Ken was present for three days and nights. Though the junior bishop there, he &#145;was the most in favour with (the king) of all the bishops&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 392), and took the lead. Speaking with &#145;an elevation of thought and expression like a man who was inspired&#146;  (ibid., 218), he tried to awaken the king's conscience. Although he had received communion from Ken himself as recently as Christmas, the king now stubbornly refused the sacrament. Despite receiving a mere nod regarding penitence, Ken absolved the clearly adamant king. Courageous as ever, he demanded the removal of the king's mistress, the duchess of Portsmouth, from the bedchamber and the admission of the queen. Eventually it was Father John Huddleston who, with the king's active consent, administered the last rites. Charles died on 6 February, a Catholic, despite all Ken's efforts. Apparently none of the bishops attended the royal funeral in Henry VII's chapel on 14 February.<br>
<br>Enthroned by proxy on 6 February 1685, Ken instituted his first incumbent to a benefice six days later, but it was the national scene that soon came to dominate his brief tenure of the see. On 23 April he fulfilled the historic role of the bishop of Bath and Wells at the coronation as one of the king's supporters, while Turner, now bishop of Ely, preached. A mere six weeks later Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis to set his rebellion in motion. On 13 June local Monmouth sympathizers rioted near Wells Cathedral; by 30 June horses were stabled there and on 1 July the mob broke in and ransacked the building. In almost daily attendance at the Lords, and loyal to the king, Ken was in London during these tumultuous events and was still away when Monmouth was defeated at Sedgemoor (6 July) and subsequently captured. On 13 and 14 July Ken and Turner, chosen specifically by James, were in the Tower of London with Monmouth. They told him of his impending execution, obtained from him a declaration of his illegitimacy, and prepared him for death. On 15 July, after passing the night with the duke, they, with Hooper and Tenison, accompanied him to the scaffold.<br>
<br>Ken then journeyed to Somerset and, appealing to James, tried to halt the appalling carnage being perpetrated under the military commanders Feversham and Kirke. Accordingly several hundred prisoners were saved from death. After unsuccessfully interceding with Judge Jeffreys, Ken spent his time day and night visiting prisoners at Wells, Taunton, and Bridgwater, supplying their wants where possible. At the Bloody Assize that followed at Wells, 97 of 500 prisoners were condemned to death and 385 to transportation.<br>
<br>The king and Ken held each other in considerable esteem. James seemed to respect the bishop's boldness, his deep faith, his ascetic way of life, his preaching skills as &#145;the best preacher among the Protestants&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.548), and the work he had done in The Hague and in Tangier, while Ken also admired James. This went beyond his natural respect for an anointed monarch. He was also a friend who not only appreciated James's genuine affection for his children, but had pastoral concern for his soul. Nevertheless James's maladroit and politically insensitive Romanist policies thrust Ken into opposition.<br>
<br>The tide of Romanism was now gathering pace. In November 1685 the papal nuncio arrived. In March 1686 James issued a declaration of indulgence for Scotland, and in July set up the commission for ecclesiastical causes. Though by nature no controversialist, as part of the growing campaign of anti-Catholic preaching Ken felt increasingly fired to protest with a series of sermons, and he had the temerity to do so. In March 1687, for instance, at Whitehall in Princess Anne's presence he preached on &#145;the blasphemies, perfidy, wresting of scriptures, preference of traditions before it, spirit of persecution, legends and fables of the scribes and pharisees&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.541) as an obvious allusion to the current situation with the Romanists. He followed this with another on the following Sunday at St Martin-in-the-Fields. There was sensation in London. Anne was even keen enough to request a special invitation to listen to Ken in Turner's London chapel. Soon afterwards James issued his first declaration of indulgence in England. In May Ken again preached fervently before the queen at Bath, where she was taking the waters. An Irish Jesuit's pamphleteering reply met with no response from Ken. Later the same month the king, discourteously without Ken's knowledge, touched for the king's evil in Bath Abbey, using a specially revived Romish rite. It was not a good year; by December Compton had been suspended and Sancroft was banned from court.<br>
<br>In 1688 Ken resumed his passionate preaching. On 1 April in Anne's presence he preached &#145;with his accustomed action, zeal and energy&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.578) and again people flocked to hear him. This sermon in the royal court was audacious, drawing a parallel between the English church and ancient Judah and Israel in captivity, as they patiently awaited the arrival of a saviour. In the face of Romish dangers Ken called for collaboration with dissenters, though not for comprehension. James, not present at the time, was nettled enough to request a discussion afterwards. In April the king issued his second declaration of indulgence in England. Whereas this in itself posed no real problem for the bishops, the subsequent order in council, enforcing it to be read publicly in late May or early June, certainly did, for this active element implied approval of the king's dispensing power.<br>
<br>On 18 May under Sancroft's leadership Ken and other bishops drew up and signed a moderate, but firm, petition opposing the dispensing power. This they delivered personally by barge to Whitehall that evening, but almost immediately, to the bishops' shocked surprise, it was leaked to the popular coffee houses. When the king consequently demanded the bishops' appearance at the privy council on 8 June they, as peers, refused to enter into recognizances and were committed to the Tower. After a trial in the king's bench they were acquitted on 30 June amid great rejoicing.<br>
<br>Ken stayed on in London briefly as adviser to the ailing Sancroft. When news of William's preparations for invasion reached England, Ken and other prelates met James several times at his request. On 3 October Ken and Sancroft again visited the king with further suggestions to alleviate political tension, but it was fruitless. This was Ken's final meeting with James, and he left for Wells soon afterwards. Little is known of Ken's part in the discussions which soon led to James's abject capitulations to the Anglican episcopate in what has been dubbed &#145;the Anglican revolution&#146;  (Goldie, 108). On 23 September Ken had declared his constant readiness to serve the king &#145;as far as can be consistent with my superior duty to God&#146;  (Plumptre, 2.11&#150;12). William landed at Brixham on 5 November. By 24 November the Dutch were seizing houses in the Wells neighbourhood. Because Ken knew William and Mary personally, he decided to retire to the countryside, probably to Poulshot. On 18 December James left the kingdom.<h2>
<a name="MinistryunderWilliamIIIanddeprivation"></a>Ministry under William III and deprivation</h2>After Christmas in Wells, which included his Advent ordination two days beforehand, Ken reached London on 10 January 1689 and had discussions with other bishops about issues arising from William's arrival. In the Convention, meeting first on 22 January, Ken consistently voted for a regency, against declaring William and Mary king and queen, and against taking new oaths to the new monarchs. On 12 February Ken left the Lords, never to return, and went back to Wells.<br>
<br>Ken now had to make the hard decision about personally swearing the oaths, but, unlike some, he hesitated. Despite his personal vow to James II and his denial of parliament's claim to deprive clergy of preferments, he realized that many of James's policies had been misconceived. He refused to trim to William for office like some but, shrinking from the prospect of permanent schism, he distanced himself from the bitterness and scurrilous libels that future nonjurors indulged in. To hard-liners he was a waverer. To Henry Dodwell he was &#145;fluctuating&#146;  (Plumptre, 2.41); to Francis Turner, his friend, he was &#145;warping from us &hellip; towards a compliance with the new government&#146;  (ibid., 40). Indeed, George Hooper at Lambeth, with whom he stayed before Ascensiontide 1689, &#145;so superfined&#146; upon him that he all but persuaded him to take the oaths  (Marshall, 52). In July Ken announced his decision to refuse them, and was officially suspended on 1 August. He was not finally deprived, however, until mid-April 1691. Before leaving he protested formally from his throne in the cathedral, asserting his canonical rights and his continuing readiness to perform his pastoral duty. He then left the cathedral for the last time.<br>
<br>Though his tenure had been so short and his attention inevitably so distracted by the national scene, Ken was much loved in his diocese. Records show that, except during his almost daily parliamentary attendance up to July 1685, he personally instituted to benefices until February 1690 and confirmed regularly until his final deprivation over a year later. He carried out visitations in 1686 and 1689 and starting in May 1686 he ordained regularly, usually at Trinity and Michaelmas, though his last was in Advent, on 23 December 1688. All ordinations took place in Wells, in the palace chapel or the cathedral.<br>
<br>In his diocese, calling himself &#145;Thomas, unworthy bishop of Bath and Wells&#146;, Ken was essentially a pastor and teacher  (Ken, <span class="italic">Prose Works</span>, ed. Round, 445). Simple in his own lifestyle, his holiness and asceticism impressed all and won the love of the people. At Wells he frequently had twelve poor people to dine with him, and tried unsuccessfully to establish a workhouse for the poor. After his consecration he typically refused to hold an extravagant banquet, but instead gave &pound;100 to the building of St Paul's. Appealing to his clergy in 1686 to support the Huguenots recently expelled from France, he himself contributed substantially from episcopal funds.<br>
<br>Ministering in his first year to prisoners after Monmouth's rebellion, Ken was appalled by &#145;a lamentable ignorance and forgetfulness of God&#146; which he found among them  (Plumptre, 1.237), and accelerated publication of his <span class="italic">Practice of Divine Love</span>. This was soon followed by the simpler <span class="italic">Directions for Prayer for the Diocese</span>, and plans to found schools in several Somerset towns. He also wrote a manual for those rich and poor taking the waters at Bath. In February 1688 he published instructions on how to keep Lent.<br>
<br>But Ken's deprivation caused a sea change in his life. When Richard Kidder was consecrated as his successor in August 1691, Ken could only refer to him, with unusual bitterness, as &#145;my successor, or rather supplanter &hellip; He is a person of whom I have no knowledge&#146;  (Plumptre, 2.52). Ken himself had lost his role, not only his beloved diocese with its pastoral care and its income, but also his place in national affairs. While James and his ministers had often called upon him for advice, Ken, with the familiar cry of the role-loser, now found he was &#145;wholly in the dark&#146;, knowing nothing  (ibid., 2.39).<h2>
<a name="Kenthenonjuror"></a>Ken the nonjuror</h2>Though Lord Weymouth was himself no nonjuror, he had been a friend of Ken's since their Oxford days, and was sympathetic to the group. He now offered Ken a home at Longleat. Ken left Wells with a mere &pound;700 from the sale of his possessions, in exchange for which Lord Weymouth granted him a life annuity of &pound;80. From now onwards he lived mainly at Longleat, also spending time in other places&#151;Poulshot, where his nephew, Isaac Walton, was rector, Leweston, the Thynne family home, and Naish Court, near Portishead, with the Kemeys sisters. His relationship with his nonjuring colleagues, apart from two moderates, Robert Frampton and John Fitzwilliam, was never happy. Nevertheless, when abusive pamphleteering hounded the nonjurors in 1690 soon after the English fleet's defeat off Beachy Head, Ken closed ranks with them in denying any part in conspiracies. Later, however, he characteristically distanced himself from the other more belligerent nonjurors, including Turner, as they developed closer contacts with James II in France. Still tortured in conscience, Ken above all abhorred anything that seemed to perpetuate the schism between the nonjurors and the church, and thus vigorously opposed the clandestine consecration of two nonjurors as bishops in February 1694 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47712', "Nonjuring bishops")</script>].<br>
<br>Ken was still prepared to come out of obscurity when necessary. In December 1694 Queen Mary died, but nonjurors had never been happy with her part in superseding her father. Consequently in March 1695 Ken wrote to Archbishop Tenison, condemning his na&iuml;ve attendance at the queen's deathbed and his subsequent adulatory sermon. In April, fully robed, Ken&#151;on the only occasion he did so after his deprivation&#151;officiated at All Hallows Barking at the funeral of the nonjuring devotional writer John Kettlewell, a moderate like himself. Soon afterwards, with others, he supported Kettlewell's plan to establish a charity for deprived nonjuring clergy. Kettlewell's death affected Ken profoundly, and from then onwards he sought to minimize and, if possible, end the division they both hated so much. In the confused aftermath of the 1696 plot to assassinate William, Ken was arrested with others, but after being summoned before the council and interrogated he was released.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the breach with other nonjurors widened. In 1701, after several nonjuring prelates had died, Ken, still in search of an end to the schism, proposed to Lloyd that they, as the two surviving prelates, should renounce the canonical claims to their bishoprics. This created further offence.<br>
<br>In 1702 the new queen, Anne, offered to restore Ken to Bath and Wells by translating Kidder to Carlisle, but he refused; he felt unable to take the new oath of abjuration, and was also in poor health. Kidder died in the great storm of October 1703. Nonjuring extremists regarded this as an act of providence, but not so Ken. Mixed though his feelings must have been it was to him a &#145;deplorable calamity&#146;. He was filled with a natural awe and pity. Anne now offered Hooper the bishopric, which out of deference for Ken he initially refused. Ken, however, persuaded him to accept, and agreed to cede his rights to him, as a means of stopping &#145;a Latitudinarian traditour&#146;  (Plumptre, 2.133) from taking the see. Ken now significantly abandoned his episcopal signature &#145;Tho: Bath and Wells&#146;. Lloyd and other nonjurors condemned Ken for treachery, while Anne granted him a pension of &pound;200.<br>
<br>With Lloyd's death in January 1710 Ken, now the only surviving nonjuring prelate, told Robert Nelson, a moderate nonjuring layman, philanthropist, and writer, that he thought the schism should end. In line with Ken's wishes, from Lent 1710 onwards moderate nonjurors started attending their parish churches. Soon afterwards Ken announced his intention of receiving the sacrament from Hooper in Wells Cathedral, but it was probably his rapidly declining health that prevented this significant step from happening. After a period at Bristol Hotwells from April to November 1710, he visited Leweston, where he succumbed to paralysis and dropsy. The following March he reached Longleat, but died soon afterwards, on 19 March. Two days later he was buried modestly at sunrise, as he wished, in Frome parish churchyard beneath the east window of St John's Church, his coffin being draped in a plain black cloth instead of a funeral pall. In his will he declared:<blockquote>I die in the holy catholic and apostolic faith, professed by the whole church before the disunion of east and west; more particularly I die in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all papal and puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the cross. (will, fol. 289<i>v</i>)</blockquote>Among Ken's legacies were a number of small bequests to family members; Viscount Weymouth was left all those books of Ken's of which Weymouth did not already have copies. He left &pound;500 to the deprived English clergy, &pound;40 to deprived officers of the church, and &pound;50 to the deprived Scottish clergy. He also bequeathed a wooden cup with gold lining and Lord Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span> to his friend Mrs Margaret Mathew of Cardiff, and a chalice to the parish where he was buried, for the use of sick persons desiring the sacrament.<h2>
<a name="Kenswritings"></a>Ken's writings</h2>Ken's important writings were devotional, written in his earlier days. His <span class="italic">Manual of Prayers for the Use of Winchester Scholars</span> (1674), intrinsically valuable, is primarily noteworthy for the three <span class="italic">Hymns for Morning, Evening and Midnight</span>, written about 1670 but first appended to the eighth edition of 1695. They were &#145;Awake, my soul, and with the sun&#146;, &#145;Glory to thee, my God, this night&#146;, and &#145;Lord, now my sleep does me forsake&#146;. These hymns, memorable to this day, were probably inspired by canticles from the Roman breviary. Ken himself sang them daily to the accompaniment of lute or organ; he hoped Winchester scholars and others would do the same.<br>
<br>Ken's <span class="italic">Practice of Divine Love</span> (1685), a devotional exposition of the catechism, was written for his diocese and republished in the following year with <span class="italic">Directions for Prayer</span>. In Rupp's words &#145;No other contemporary catechism has such a &#147;devotion of rapture&#148;&#146; which, though redolent of the medieval mystics, &#145;is an authentically seventeenth-century devotion&#151;Puritan as well as Caroline&#146;  (Rupp, 14). Its affective mystical character is encapsulated in these words from the catechism itself: &#145;Thou, Lord, art my hope, my trust, my life, my joy, my glory, my God, my all, my love&#146;  (T. Ken, <span class="italic">Practice of Divine Love</span>, 1685, 2).<br>
<br>Ken's only other contemporary publications were few, but included three of his sermons, <span class="italic">Sermon Preached at the Funeral of Lady Mainard</span> (1682), <span class="italic">Sermon Preached at Whitehall</span> (1685), and another at Whitehall on Passion Sunday 1688. Rupp has described his preaching style as belonging &#145;to an older generation, and the beautiful passages, in which he loves to repeat a key word, have a haunting and melodic quality unlike that of the new preaching age&#146;  (Rupp, 13). Other prose works include his <span class="italic">Pastoral Letter</span> in support of the French protestants (1686) and his <span class="italic">Letter to (Archbishop Tenison) on his Sermon Preached at the Funeral of her Late Majesty</span> (1695), but two works, <span class="italic">Ichabod</span>, otherwise known as <span class="italic">Expostularia</span>, and <span class="italic">The Royal Sufferer</span>, are no longer attributed to him.<br>
<br>After Ken's death William Hawkins, his nephew, found Ken to have been also a prolific, if clandestine, writer of poetry, and published his works in four volumes containing 2058 pages. Apart from the hymns, his poetry, probably written as a private therapy to alleviate the frustrations of his later life, was poor in quality and clearly not intended for publication; even Ken's greatest admirers are uncharacteristically critical. One work, &#145;Edmund&#146;, a long epic, probably written in his last years, was a reflection on his life's vicissitudes, while &#145;Hymnotheo&#146; was a thinly veiled autobiography.<h2>
<a name="Appearanceandcharacter"></a>Appearance and character</h2>Though small, sparely built with dark hair and eyes, Ken had a powerful personality. Endowed with &#145;a very lively temper, but too hot and sudden&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 382), he was a fiery, passionate preacher, drawing large crowds in the 1680s. He could be venomous when, for instance, attacking Dutch Calvinists or latitudinarians, but was always ready to ask for forgiveness for any hurt caused. Not a great intellectual, he was nevertheless scholarly and read French, Spanish, and Italian. Ascetic in his lifestyle and generous with his income, Ken was never wealthy, finding it necessary to borrow even for his consecration expenses. In London, while other bishops used coaches, Ken went on foot.<br>
<br>The holiness of Ken's life was paramount. To the twenty-first-century observer he initially may seem sanctimonious. The tone of his letters, headed constantly by &#145;All Glory Be To God&#146;, chimes uneasily in a materialistic age, but a study of his life reveals a man of genuine holiness rooted in the practicalities of life. A devotional writer, his spirituality is reminiscent of the French and Spanish mystics, whose books furnished his library.<br>
<br>With conscience as his guide Ken showed remarkable physical and moral resilience. No seaman, he endured uncomplainingly the rigours of the hazardous journeys to and from Tangier. He displayed moral audacity in speaking his mind whether to William at The Hague, to the people of Tangier, the royal court in London, or to Charles II or James II in person. He was never bitter in confronting wrong, whether political, ecclesiastical, or ethical, except perhaps when Kidder &#145;supplanted&#146; him, but he could not condone Mary's apparent frivolity when taking over her father's inheritance at Whitehall. Not a typical nonjuror, he was equally firm with his nonjuring colleagues, and had no truck with the rancorous controversy they provoked. A moderate in all his dealings, his opposition to the new oaths was tempered by his paramount desire for the peace, unity, and welfare of the church. Ken suffered the full agony caused by the dichotomy of his stance. Though always ready, when necessary, to fight and preach vigorously for what he felt to be right, he found it more important to welcome Hooper as his successor and thus defend the church's truths than to encourage permanent schism by prolonging the nonjuring protest. An ascetic, courageous, saintly figure, living always true to his love for God and his fellow men, and to his principles, he justly deserves a high place in the annals of church and nation.<br>
