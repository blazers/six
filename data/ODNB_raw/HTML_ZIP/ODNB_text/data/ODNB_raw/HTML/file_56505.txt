<span class="headword">Hastings,  Barbara  Rawdon</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Barbara Yelverton]</span>, marchioness of Hastings and <i>suo jure</i> Baroness Grey of Ruthin  (1810&#150;1858), <span class="occ">fossil collector and geological author</span>, was born on 20 May 1810 at Brandon House in Warwickshire, the only child of Henry Edward Yelverton, Baron Grey of Ruthin (1780&#150;1810), and his wife, Anna Maria Kelham (1792&#150;1875). In 1811, following the death of her father, Barbara Yelverton became Baroness Grey of Ruthin. Little else is known of her early life or education. On 1 August 1831 she married George Augustus Francis Rawdon Hastings, second marquess of Hastings (1808&#150;1844), with whom she had six children. On 9 April 1845 Barbara Rawdon Hastings married her second husband, Hastings Reginald Henry (1808&#150;1878), a captain in the Royal Navy. (In 1849 her husband took, by royal licence, the surname Yelverton [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50203/', "Yelverton, Hastings Reginald")</script>].) The couple settled at Efford House, near Lymington in Hampshire, and had a daughter.<br>
<br>Hastings's life was a mixture of social and scientific activity. During her first marriage she was nicknamed the jolly fast marchioness, and developed a taste for foreign travel and gambling. However, she was also a keen collector of fossil vertebrates, and during her second marriage established a private museum at Efford House for her specimens. The palaeontologist Richard Owen noted that among the thousands of fossils in the museum were some of the finest in the world  (Owen, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.296).<br>
<br>Hastings's fossil collection was a valuable scientific resource. &#145;Most of the specimens&#146;, she told G. R. Waterhouse of the British Museum in 1854, &#145;are figured in the Palaeontological work&#146;  (Archives of the British Museum of Natural History, Correspondence, 1851&#150;5, DF 100/7). However, Hastings did more than simply amass raw material for research; her detailed knowledge of local geology (particularly of the Eocene beds of Hordle cliff), together with her painstaking reconstruction of fossil remains, gave her an expertise that was valued by her contemporaries. She was, said geologist Edward Forbes, &#145;a &#147;fossilist&#148; and knows her work&#146;  (Wilson and Geikie, 423). Richard Owen named a fossil crocodile from Hordle cliff <i>Crocodilus hastingsae</i> &#145;in honour of the accomplished lady by whom the singularly perfect example of the species had been recovered and restored&#146;  (Owen, &#145;Fossils&#146;, 66).<br>
<br>Nevertheless, despite her expertise, Hastings occupied an ambiguous place in Victorian geology. At a time when science was the preserve of gentlemen scholars she often took on the role of female drudge: &#145;I have been six hours mending bones, &amp; feel tired &amp; stupid&#146;, she wrote to Owen in 1847  (Archives of the British Museum of Natural History, Owen correspondence, vol.14 NH 14:400). High birth and independent wealth, however, secured her access to the world of her male contemporaries, able to pursue their chosen specialism at leisure. In 1847 Hastings became &#145;a fixed star&#146;  (Owen, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.296) of the Oxford meeting of the British Association when she exhibited two crocodile skulls and a turtle shell excavated from Hordle cliff. Genuine significance was attached to these specimens, as Owen explained when he addressed the meeting. Some of the reptilian remains, he suggested, indicated that there was &#145;a new genus of Pachyderm&#146;  (Owen, &#145;Fossils&#146;, 65), named Paloplotherium by Owen, between the Palaeotherium and Anoplotherium. Hastings also addressed the meeting and argued that the presence of crocodile remains on both the Hampshire coast and the Isle of Wight revealed that the space occupied by the Solent had once been occupied by a freshwater lake or river  (see &#145;On the freshwater Eocene beds of Hordle cliff, Hampshire&#146;, <span class="italic">Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science</span>, 1848).<br>
<br>Hastings continued her studies of local geology and published papers on the stratigraphy of Hordle cliff in 1852 and 1853. Having spent six years on very minute researches of the strata she was well placed to assess the impact of phenomena such as cliff falls and sea erosion which might have eluded the short-term observer  (see &#145;On the Tertiary beds of Hordwell, Hampshire&#146;, <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 4th ser., 1853, 1). Hastings's were the first accurate stratigraphical accounts of Hordle cliff to be published, and contributed to knowledge of the Tertiary period.<br>
<br>In 1855 Hastings sold her collection of mammalian and reptilian fossils. Her gambling instincts seemed to come in to play for, after threatening to send the fossils to Paris (where &#145;they would be treated as immense treasures&#146;), she secured &pound;300 for the entire collection from the British Museum  (Archives of the British Museum of Natural History, Correspondence, 1851&#150;5, DF 100/7). The collection subsequently went to the palaeontology department of the Natural History Museum in London. Hastings died of apoplexy in Rome on 18 November 1858, and was buried in the English cemetery there a week later. She was survived by her second husband.<br>
