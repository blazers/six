<span class="headword">Aston,  Anthony</span> <span class="st"> [<em>performing name </em>Mat Medley]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1682&#150;1753?), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was probably born in Tamworth, Staffordshire, the son of Richard Aston, an attorney and principal of Furnival's Inn and secondary to the king's bench office; his mother was the daughter of Colonel Cope of Drumully Castle, co. Armagh. Following education in Tamworth, Aston started his working life as a legal clerk, but at the age of fourteen he left to follow a career in theatre. In a pamphlet of twenty-four pages, entitled <span class="italic">A Brief Supplement to Colley Cibber, Esq.: his &#145;Lives of the Late Famous Actors and Actresses&#146;</span>, apparently written about 1747, he states that he came on the stage at the latter end of the reign of William III. He joined the duke of Norfolk's players in 1696 and was at Drury Lane in 1697&#150;8. After a brief trip to Ireland he returned to London, claiming he had acted at the Old Play House.<br>
<br>Between 1700 and 1704 Aston left the theatre, became a soldier, and journeyed to Jamaica and North America, where he claims that he had many experiences involving married women, shipwrecks, poverty, and hardship. He arrived back in England penniless and went to London, where in 1704 he &#145;marry'd a Bartholomew-Fair Lady&#146;. In 1706, when Aston was about twenty-four, the couple had a son, Walter. The family travelled through England, Ireland, and Scotland, and at the chief towns Aston presented a medley entertainment of humorous scenes from various plays, with songs and dialogue of his own composition. During this period he also wrote <span class="italic">Love in a Hurry</span>, performed at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, about 1709, and <span class="italic">Pastora, or, The Coy Shepherdess</span>, an opera performed by the Duke of Richmond's Servants at Tunbridge Wells in 1712. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> for 1 January 1712 contained an advertisement placed by the popular comedian Richard Estcourt, saying that he was about to open the Bumper tavern in James Street, Covent Garden, and that his wines would be sold with the utmost fidelity by his old servant, Trusty Antony, &#145;who had so often adorned both the theatres in England and Ireland&#146;. It has been suggested that Aston was this servant. In 1717 Aston is said to have performed three times a week at the Globe and Marlborough taverns in Fleet Street.<br>
<br>Aston's life became one long tour, moving between London, the rest of England, and Edinburgh. While acting in many plays with various companies he changed and perfected his &#145;medley&#146;, which he continued to perform, mostly in taverns. In 1726 he returned to Edinburgh, where he planned to stay, or so he told his friend Allan Ramsay, who defended him against a disbelieving magistracy. Aston was probably seen, like most wandering players, as an untrustworthy rogue. He eventually left the city after being accused of helping to &#145;entice away&#146; Mrs Jean Kerr, the wife of his son Walter  (<span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span>, 15 April 1728). Approaching the age of fifty, Aston moved back to London, and though his wanderlust never vanished he did begin to mellow. In 1730&#150;31 he wrote <span class="italic">The Fool's Opera</span>, &#145;written by Matthew Medley and performed by his company in Oxford&#146;, with an autobiographical sketch attached, from which information about his life can be gleaned. His nickname was now Mat Medley, and on Friday evenings in his own rooms in St Patrick's Close he performed his hodgepodge. In 1735 he petitioned the House of Commons to be heard against the bill introduced by Sir John Barnard for restraining the number of theatres and for the better regulating of common players of interludes, when he was permitted to deliver a ludicrous speech upon the subject; this was afterwards published in folio.<br>
<br>Aston's son became an actor in his company, and died before 14 March 1743, for on that date a benefit was given by Aston for the widow and three children of Walter Aston. Chetwood, whose history was published in 1749, believed that the elder Aston was then living and &#145;travelling still, and as well known as the post-horse that carries the mail&#146;  (Chetwood, 90). It is not known exactly when he died, though it was believed to be in 1753. Chetwood encapsulates Aston's diverse and colourful career well: &#145;He play'd in all the Theatres of London, but never continued long in any: His way of living was particular to himself and family, resorting to the principal Cities and Towns in England with his medley &hellip; between every Scene, a Song or Dialogue of his own Composition, fill'd up the Chinks of the slender Meal&#146;  (ibid., 88).<br>
