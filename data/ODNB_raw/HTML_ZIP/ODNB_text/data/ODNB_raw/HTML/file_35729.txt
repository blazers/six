<span class="headword">Reynolds,  (James) Emerson</span>  (1844&#150;1920), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 8 January 1844 at Booterstown, co. Dublin, the only son of James Reynolds, apothecary and playwright, and his wife, a former Miss Campbell. On leaving school Reynolds became assistant to his father, and developed a strong interest in chemistry. He studied medicine, and in 1865 qualified as a licentiate of both the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He had installed a small laboratory in his home at Booterstown, where he pursued his chemical research. His first paper, &#145;On the oleaginous matter formed on dissolving different kinds of iron in dilute acids&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">Chemical News</span> (1861), when he was only seventeen years of age. Reynolds published further articles and, after practising medicine for a short time in Dublin, devoted himself solely to chemistry.<br>
<br>In March 1867 Reynolds was appointed keeper of minerals at the National Museum in Dublin, and in the following year analyst to the Royal Dublin Society. Probably his most significant contribution to chemistry was his discovery of thiourea, the sulphur analogue of urea, in 1868. The existence of this compound was indicated by theory but distinguished scientists of the time such as Liebig and Hofmann had been unable to isolate it. His account of the isolation of thiourea, published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Dublin Society</span> and <span class="italic">Journal of the Chemical Society</span> for 1869, attracted much attention and was promptly republished in several continental scientific periodicals. It at once established Reynolds's position as one of the most promising of the younger British chemists.<br>
<br>While retaining both his other posts, Reynolds was appointed professor of chemistry at the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin, in 1870. The following year he described the preparation of an interesting compound of propanone (acetone) and mercury (II) oxide. This was the first colloidal derivative of mercury and its formation is the basis of Reynolds's test for propanone. In 1875 he relinquished the museum and Royal Dublin Society positions when he was appointed professor of chemistry at Trinity College, Dublin, as successor to Dr James Apjohn. In the same year, on 12 February, he married Janet Elizabeth, daughter of Prebendary John Finlayson, of Christ Church, Dublin, with whom he had a son, Alfred John, and a daughter, Marion Janet Elizabeth.<br>
<br>At Trinity College Reynolds acted as a public analyst and consultant and helped to produce the <span class="italic">Manual of Public Health for Ireland</span>. He was also responsible for the analysis of the Dublin water supply. His interest in analytical chemistry included spectroscopy, a subject in its infancy at that time. Though his duties left him little time for research, he published more than a dozen scientific papers during the twenty-eight years that he remained there.<br>
<br>Reynolds also made a significant contribution to silicon chemistry and to the chemistry of minerals containing silicon. He studied organo-silicon compounds including carrying out the syntheses of Si(NH.C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> and Si(N.C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. He synthesized CaSi<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub> and the mineral anorthite as described below.<br>
<br>Reynolds was impressed by the concept of periodicity. In 1886 he displayed the elements graphically according to the periodic law and, from a comparison of the specific heat capacities of silver and beryllium, was able to conclude that the relative atomic mass of the latter was nine and that it was therefore a member of the alkaline earth group in the periodic table. Reynolds took a serious interest in his role as a chemistry teacher. T. E. Thorpe, the writer of his obituary, describes how he took particular care with his lecture preparation, his demonstrations and practical work. He was one of the first to introduce quantitative work into a student's early chemical training. His book <span class="italic">Experimental Chemistry for Junior Students</span> (1882) was favourably received and had considerable success, going through several editions. He worked also as an examiner in chemistry with W. A. Tilden and W. N. Hartley for the Department of Science and Art (1895&#150;7).<br>
<br>Reynolds was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1880, and vice-president for 1901&#150;2. He was president of the Society of the Chemical Industry (1891), and of the chemical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1893). In 1903, Reynolds resigned his chair and went to live in London. At the Davy&#150;Faraday Laboratory he continued research, chiefly on silicon compounds, his last work (1913) being the synthesis of a felspar, anorthite, a calcium aluminum silicate, which had the properties of the naturally occurring mineral. His mental capacities were active to the end of his life, but his eyesight, never very good, gradually failed during his later years. He died on 17 February 1920, at his home, 3 Inverness Gardens, Kensington, London.<br>
