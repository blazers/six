<span class="headword">Whitaker, Sir  Edward</span>  (1660?&#150;1735), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was appointed lieutenant of the <i>Swallow</i>, then commanded by Matthew Aylmer, on 16 October 1688. In 1689 he was in the <i>Mary</i>, in 1690 (again with Aylmer) in the <i>Royal Katherine</i>, and on 15 May 1690 he was promoted captain of the <i>Dover</i> (44 guns), in which, during the following three years, he took several rich prizes and captured many French privateers. On 27 September 1692 he married Ann Stephens (<i>d</i>. 1705) of Leigh, Essex. In the same year he was noted as a client of Edward Russell (later earl of Orford), as well as continuing to enjoy the patronage of Aylmer, under whom he was flag-captain in the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> in 1693&#150;4. Between 1695 and 1696 he commanded the <i>Elizabeth</i>, <i>Monck</i>, and <i>St Andrew</i>, and was flag-captain to Sir Cloudesley Shovell in the <i>Victory</i>. In the 1690s he was living at Leigh in Essex.<br>
<br>In May 1699 Whitaker was appointed to the <i>Portland</i>, and on 13 January 1702 to the <i>Ranelagh</i>, one of fifty ships commissioned on the same day. A month later, on 16 February, he was appointed master-attendant at Woolwich; he held that office throughout the year. In January 1703 he took command of the <i>Dorsetshire</i>, one of the fleet which went with Sir George Rooke to the Mediterranean in 1704. In the capture of Gibraltar, Whitaker acted as aide-de-camp to Sir George Byng, commanded the boats in the attack, rallied the men when they were panic-stricken by the explosion of a magazine, and hoisted the English colours on the bastion. In the battle of Malaga (August 1704) the <i>Dorsetshire</i> was one of the Red squadron, and was closely engaged throughout. Whitaker was knighted soon afterwards, and in 1705 he commanded the <i>Barfleur</i>. Early in 1706 he was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and appointed to command a squadron off Dunkirk; in April he convoyed the duke of Marlborough to Holland.<br>
<br>In 1708, with his flag in the <i>Northumberland</i>, Whitaker went out to the Mediterranean with Sir John Leake, and in August he commanded the detachment which co-operated in the capture of Minorca. When Leake returned to England, Whitaker remained in command, and on 21 December was promoted vice-admiral of the blue. A commission of 20 December to admiral of the blue seems to have been cancelled, and on 14 November 1709 he was made vice-admiral of the white. In January 1709 he was relieved from the position of commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean by Sir George Byng, with whom he remained as second in command, ferrying imperial troops and taking part in the failed attempt to lift the siege of Alicante. He succeeded to the chief command again when Byng returned to England in September 1709. In the summer of 1710 Whitaker also returned to England, and on 26 June he married Cecil (<i>d</i>. 1726), his first wife, Ann, having died on 17 June 1705. He was commanding in the downs, cruising in the channel in 1710&#150;12, and played a major part in the occupation of Dunkirk in July 1712. After declining the post of second in command in the Baltic in 1716 he lived in retirement at Carshalton, Surrey. Whitaker died there on 12 November 1735. His will was proved on 3 December by his niece, Mary Whitaker, sole executrix, his second wife having died on 14 February 1726. The will also mentioned first, a nephew, Samuel Whitaker, captain of a ship at Gibraltar and Malaga, and therefore often confused with his uncle; and, second, a granddaughter Ann, daughter of his son, Edward (<i>d</i>. 1729).<br>
