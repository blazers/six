<span class="headword">Llwyd,  Morgan</span>  (1619&#150;1659), <span class="occ">Independent minister and mystic</span>, was born at Cynfal, a farmstead in Maentwrog parish, Merioneth, of a family of small squires renowned for literary prowess. A near relative, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16866/', "Huw Llwyd (c.1568&#150;c.1630)")</script> who, some claim, may have been Morgan's father or grandfather, served as a professional soldier in the Low Countries before returning to provide a focus at Cynfal for the efforts of strict-metre poets who celebrated the hospitality and traditional hunting skills of its lord.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcivilwar"></a>Early life and civil war</h2>Little definite is known of Morgan Llwyd's parentage and upbringing, beyond the fact that his mother's first name was Mary and that she lived until 1680. It is suggested that he was educated at Wrexham, to account for his coming under the influence of Walter Cradock, curate there from 1634. It was certainly in Denbighshire, according to his own account, that he was converted, possibly at Bromfield, and there are sufficient grounds to be confident that he followed Cradock to Llanfair Waterdine, Shropshire, although no certain link between Llwyd and the Harley family, patrons of godly ministers there, can be traced. It is not known when, or indeed if, Llwyd was ordained, but it is likely that he obtained some clerical appointment at Llanfair. Having moved with Cradock thence to Monmouthshire, Llwyd was married, to Ann, probably the sister of the wife of Edward Herbert of Magor, later MP for that county; and there he became associated in some way, on the eve of the civil war, with the Independent congregation at Llanfaches.<br>
<br>We rely heavily on Llwyd's autobiography in verse, &#145;Hanes rhyw Gymro&#146;, for what may have been his military postings, rather than wanderings, during the civil war. With the other Welsh Independent ministers of south-east Wales, Cradock and Henry Walter, Llwyd left the county in the face of the mobilizing royalist forces, and saw something of Glamorgan, Gloucester, and Somerset. It is impossible to ascribe precise dates to his movements, but his appearances in Portsmouth, London, Kent, and Pembrokeshire tell us that he accompanied the forces of parliament, and that he must have sailed to south-west Wales early in 1644. It cannot be shown that he was ever formally a chaplain, but he was probably among the Welsh ministers at Portsmouth who petitioned parliament in July 1644; Llwyd tells us that he was in southern England for a second time. From this point, he probably became attached to the force of Sir Thomas Myddelton, which had been formed to reduce north Wales to the will of parliament. The House of Commons, with the approval of the Westminster assembly of divines, sent Llwyd and Ambrose Mostyn to Myddelton as approved Welsh-language preachers, and it was by means of this service that Llwyd returned to Denbighshire, to minister at Wrexham, Myddelton's headquarters, in 1647. Before this, however, he may have been acquiring a reputation for preaching an egalitarian message. The &#145;Floyd&#146; who preached to the troop of Major Robert Huntingdon, in the New Model horse regiment of Oliver Cromwell at Aston Rowant, Oxfordshire, in June 1646, sounds like Morgan Llwyd.<h2>
<a name="Ministryandspirituality"></a>Ministry and spirituality</h2>Wrexham was home to Llwyd from 1647, and he held a state-provided stipend there from 1656, but always ministered as if to a gathered congregation. He did not confine himself solely to pastoral duties, and in the summer of 1651, with fellow preachers Jenkin Jones and Vavasor Powell, rode north with troops they had raised to contribute to the war of the Commonwealth against the Scots. This brief return to military activity, co-ordinated by Colonel Thomas Harrison, represented the high point of Llwyd's millenarian convictions. To combat the Scots, he broke off from his duties as an approving minister under the act of February 1650 for the <span class="roman">Propagation of the Gospel in Wales</span>. Llwyd's field of evangelistic activity was all over north Wales, as far west from Wrexham as the Ll&#375;n peninsula, where, he tells us, he lost his voice in preaching. These itinerant duties were undertaken in tandem with his work at Wrexham. After the <span class="roman">Propagation Act</span> was not renewed beyond April 1653, and in the early years of the Cromwellian protectorate, puritan clerical opinion in Wales divided between those in support of the principles and policies of the government, including the principle of state maintenance, and those against, who either moved towards the Quaker movement or who stayed within more formal theology as Independents or Baptists. Llwyd was courted by both sides; his name appeared on <span class="italic">A Word for God</span>, the petition hostile to Cromwell and mainly inspired by Vavasor Powell, but his marginal comments on a copy of the petition were critical of the certainties of Powell's denunciations. Although there was a hint of contempt for Llwyd in the account by George Fox of how he had reduced him (&#145;the priest&#146;) to tears by his testimony, the Wrexham minister was in fact attracted to what he called &#145;the book in every man&#146;, the &#145;fountain which springs&#146; in everyone, the quietist possibilities of interpreting the Saints' disappointments. These tendencies alienated Llwyd both from his former ally, Powell, and from the naturally less sympathetic Richard Baxter. Although he did not sign it, Llwyd was more in tune with the counter-petition, <span class="italic">The Humble Representation and Address</span>, orchestrated by his former mentor, Cradock, and endorsed by his brother-in-law, Edward Herbert. In May 1656 both Colonel Philip Jones and Colonel John Jones were keen to see Llwyd properly maintained at Wrexham, and the minister did indeed accept state maintenance, proof that his shared perspectives with the Quakers were not without limitations. Llwyd's ministry was to last only another three years; his health evidently gave him concern in May 1658, when he made his will, and he died a little over a year later, on 3 June 1659, at Wrexham, where he was buried at Rhos-ddu burial-ground.<br>
<br>In his theology Llwyd was always a radical protestant, but his early association with Cradock suggests that in his early ministry he was preaching an orthodox message. By 1648 he was evidently much affected by millenarian perspectives on public affairs, deepened by his own military service, which inclined him towards a particularly hostile view of Charles I:<blockquote>
<div>The law was ever above kings<br>
</div>
<div>and kings above the law<br>
</div>
<div>unhappy Charles provokt the lambe<br>
</div>
<div>to dust he must withdraw.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Gweithiau Morgan Llwyd</span>, ed. Ellis and Davies, 1.55)</blockquote>This interest in Fifth Monarchist ideas distanced him from Cradock, who rejected the combativeness of Vavasor Powell, as well as that of Llwyd. In the early 1650s he was forced by the disappointments of the scheme for propagating the gospel, and the failure of the nominated assembly of 1653, to adopt gradually a more cautious view of the potentialities of state power for ushering in the kingdom of Christ. His writings provide evidence that he was attracted to internalized notions of spirituality from at least as early as 1653&#150;4, and in the later 1650s such notions became more prominent in his thought. They found expression both in his flirtation with Quaker theology and in the rich but often obscure lexicon of images he drew from the German mystic Jakob Boehme. Cradock was no more in sympathy with these developments, antinomian though he was, than he had been with his former pupil's millenarian phase, and others, including Colonel John Jones and Richard Baxter, cautioned him about his glorying in impenetrable imagery or complex theology beyond the grasp of his audience or readership. By the time of his death Llwyd was rather isolated in the context of the Welsh ministry, but his correspondence with thinkers as diverse as Samuel Hartlib, Peter Sterry, and Richard Baxter ensured that he never became cut off from religious and intellectual developments of his day.<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>Llwyd was a prolific writer in both English and Welsh, although the works published in his own lifetime did not include any of the extensive free-metre verse, much of it on millenarian themes, which remained in manuscript in his papers. Of his verse, only the work on astrology for a popular audience, <span class="italic">Gwyddor uchod</span> (1657), was published. In general, Llwyd preferred the English language for his thoughts on public themes, such as the significance of the execution of Charles I, which he celebrated in the verses he called (old style) &#145;1648&#146;. These short stanzas, comparable in form with metrical versions of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and thus suitable to be set to simple tunes, dwelt on the need for godly &#145;differing brethren&#146; to seek reconciliation. In them, Llwyd saw the recasting of the British nations after 1649, the abolition of the monarchy, and set-backs suffered by the Catholic powers of Europe all as evidence of the impending kingdom of Christ. He relied heavily on ideas of inversion in these stanzas; the commission for the propagation of the gospel in Wales was proof that a once spiritually barren and politically and socially unsophisticated people were now instruments of God's will: &#145;the last is first&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gweithiau Morgan Llwyd</span>, ed. Ellis and Davies, 1.28). Llwyd's Welsh poetry is generally more reflective and more spiritual. He uses a range of metres, including the traditional <i>englyn</i> and <i>cywydd</i>, to a greater range of effects than his English verse achieves. Public themes are largely eschewed in favour of subtle paraphrases of scripture and spiritual reflections, in which the ballad form predominates.<br>
<br>It is on Morgan Llwyd's prose works, however, that his modern reputation rests. He used Welsh for his prose addresses to the Welsh people. They are marked by a sense of urgency and a deep sympathy for the common people of the country, whom he considered, with other contemporary puritan commentators, to be &#145;asleep&#146; and needing an awakening to spiritual life. He made his publishing d&eacute;but in 1653&#150;4 with three of these, <span class="italic">Llythur ir Cymru cariadus</span>, <span class="italic">Gwaedd ynghymru yn wyneb pob cydwybod</span>, and most famously, <span class="italic">Dirgelwch i rai iw ddeall ac i eraill iw watwar</span>, which Llwyd shortened to <span class="italic">Arwydd i annerch y Cymru</span> (&#145;A sign to address the Welsh people&#146;), but which is better known today as <span class="italic">Llyfr y tri aderyn</span> (&#145;The book of the three birds&#146;). <span class="italic">Llyfr y tri aderyn</span> is the most inventive and persuasive of them: ten editions of it appeared between 1714 and 1898, and several, under the auspices of the University of Wales Press, have been published in the twentieth century. The book takes the form of an allegorical, tripartite discussion between three birds, the raven, the dove, and the eagle, who meet after the flood. For Llwyd, as for Boehme, whose writings may have supplied him with the idea, Noah's ark was a type of Christ and the true church. In the allegory, the raven represents formalism in religion, the dove the true (gathered) church, and the eagle state power or, more specifically, the godly prince or magistrate, from which the true church can expect protection. The raven of formalism is protean: &#145;I can turn about with every wind, and I scent my prey afar off &hellip; whatsoever opinions the high and mighty ones may hold, I can approve them, if only I get peace in my eyrie&#146;  (Llwyd, &#145;Book of the Three Birds&#146;, 198). The eagle of state authority advocates teaching before coercion: &#145;The gimlet of instruction must precede the hammer of rule and regulation lest the wood be split, or the nail be bent&#146;  (ibid., 201). The work foreshadows the author's later flirtations with the ideas of the Quakers: &#145;The law of nature teacheth men to follow the light that is in them&#146;  (ibid., 211). Llwyd is unable to sustain the central, original, three-sided discussion, which he abandons midway through the book in favour of a more familiar catechistic format. Part of this loss of imaginative confidence may be attributed to the uncertainties of political power in early 1654, the date to which the book might best be ascribed. Nevertheless, <span class="italic">Llyfr y tri aderyn</span> provided the Welsh reading public with a volume as compelling, passionate, and accessible as the work in English of John Bunyan was to be. Llwyd adapts the theory of Geoffrey of Monmouth on the special relationship between the British Isles and the early church for Wales and his own times:<blockquote>This is the island which first received the gospel in the time of Lles, the son of Coel. Here, some say, was born Helen and her son Constantine. The Welsh, others say, were the first to discover America. Britons have been steadfast unto death in behalf of the true faith. (ibid., 213)</blockquote>A recurrent theme in this and Llwyd's prose and poetry works was that the Welsh had a special part to play in the dawning golden age of the gospel: &#145;The dawn has broken, and the sun is rising on you. The birds are singing: wake (O Welshman) wake&#146;  (&#145;Gwaedd ynghymru&#146;, <span class="italic">Gweithiau Morgan Llwyd</span>, ed. Ellis and Davies, 1.128). Llwyd went on to translate two works of Boehme's for the Welsh-language reading public: <span class="italic">Yr ymroddiad</span> (translated 1654 and published in 1657) and <span class="italic">Y discybl ai athraw o newydd</span> (translated 1655 and also published in 1657).<br>
<br>Of Llwyd's two published English prose works, which appeared in 1655, <span class="italic">An Honest Discourse</span> is the most interesting. Like <span class="italic">Llyfr y tri aderyn</span>, it is structured as a dialogue, this time between three men: citizens past, present, and future. It has a greater sense of political immediacy, and in effect establishes a dialogue with the content of Vavasor Powell's intemperate <span class="italic">A Word for God</span> about the nature of the protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. <span class="italic">An Honest Discourse</span> also resumes themes left unexplored in <span class="italic">Llyfr y tri aderyn</span>. None of Llwyd's English prose works, including the unpublished &#145;Where is Christ?&#146;, has any particular literary distinction in format or language, however, in contrast to his Welsh prose, in which a range of images, drawn from nature, and especially from the changing seasons, combines with Llwyd's emphasis on the spiritual complexities of relationships between the Trinity and the individual soul of man. His attempts to explain and explore these mysteries take him well beyond the orthodox Calvinism of his age and have given him the label &#145;mystic&#146;. Had he lived beyond 1659 he might have found eventually a natural spiritual home among the Quakers, although there was nothing simple, and much that was deeply intellectual and theologically avant-garde, in his thought.<br>
<br>A number of Morgan Llwyd's Welsh prose works were republished in the following century to satisfy the needs of a Welsh reading public stimulated by Methodism. At the end of the nineteenth century his published work, and much of his unpublished writing in manuscript, was brought together in two volumes of <span class="italic">Gweithiau</span>, published by the University of Wales and intended for the new class of readers brought into existence by the curriculum of the new university colleges. Llwyd's work, or at least <span class="italic">Llyfr y tri aderyn</span>, has since become a staple of undergraduate Welsh studies. A third volume of his writings was published by the University of Wales Press in 1994, making available, in particular, manuscripts among the Plas Iolyn collection housed at the National Library of Wales.<br>
