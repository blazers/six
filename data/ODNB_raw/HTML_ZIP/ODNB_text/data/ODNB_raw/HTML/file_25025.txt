</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seeley, Sir  John Robert</span>  (1834&#150;1895), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in London on 10 September 1834, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25027/', "Robert Benton Seeley (1798&#150;1886)")</script>, publisher and prominent evangelical, and Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson (1809&#150;1868), also an evangelical of a publishing family. After preparatory school at Stanmore, Seeley went to the City of London School under Dr G. F. W. Mortimer. A naturally bookish and eager scholar, he made rapid progress, entering the sixth form before his thirteenth year. Of &#145;slender nervous alert frame&#146;, &#145;small, spare, quick in his movements&#146;  (Wormell, 8), his health suffered, and his life's pattern began of intermittent periods of enforced withdrawal from studies.<h2>
<a name="Educationandformationofreligiousviews"></a>Education and formation of religious views</h2>In 1852 Seeley entered Christ's College, Cambridge, as a scholar. At a time when modern literature did not figure in educational curricula, his already wide command of the English writers was thought remarkable in one who was becoming an accomplished classicist. A vacation in Dresden to become well-found in German began a lifelong admiration of Germany and things German. By temperament austere, Seeley none the less made his mark in the society of his college contemporaries, who included Walter Skeat, John Hales, Walter Besant, C. S. Calverley, John Peile, and Walter Sendall; and in the university at large he was known through his brother Leonard to Henry Sidgwick and Frederic Farrar. G. W. Prothero, his later colleague in the history faculty, judged Seeley &#145;one of the ablest of an able set&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Despite being again impeded by nervous illness, Seeley graduated brilliantly in 1857 among the candidates at the top of the classical tripos, and his pre-eminence was marked by the award of the senior chancellor's medal. Christ's promptly elected him to a fellowship, where for the next two years he tutored and lectured in classics. In 1859 he returned to the City of London School as chief classical assistant master; from there in 1863 he went to University College, London (UCL), as professor of Latin.<br>
<br>Seeley's deep reading in modern English and European literatures (he published anonymously verses and translations in 1859) tended to make him impatient of much of the exclusive claims made for the Greek and Latin disciplines. His distaste for the system of competitive examinations had also by now become a distinctive trait; and UCL, he felt, was too much imbued with the examination-factory ethos then prevalent in the London colleges. All this meant that Seeley's tenure of the London chair would be likely to lead in directions diverging from his formal responsibilities to Latin and Roman studies. His edition of Livy eventually confirmed in 1871 his credentials in conventional classical scholarship; but his most characteristic production at London remained his inaugural lecture, <span class="italic">Classical Studies as an Introduction to the Moral Sciences</span> (1864). Here he argued that the educational dominance of Greek and Latin was simply a fact of life, which one perforce had to make the best of.<br>
<br>Certain trends in his thinking also contributed in these years to a fundamental shift in Seeley's intellectual outlook. The hold of his family evangelical tradition weakened under the influences of Carlyle and the &#145;Germano-Coleridgean&#146; broad-church school. His scientific colleagues at UCL impressed him by their confidence in the claims for a commanding future role for positivist principles and experimental science. Seeley took an interest in F. D. Maurice's London Working Men's College, where Christian socialists and Comtean positivists led by Edward Beesly were in uneasy alliance, striving to rescue the working classes from the temptations of communism and commercialism. Their shared idealism of a co-operatively based social order at the expense of both competitive disorder and class war appealed greatly to Seeley. His outlook on politics likewise took on a profound distaste for the &#145;interminable scurrilous brawl&#146; of political parties competing for office. The years of agitation and debate preparing for the second <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1866 and 1867 led Seeley to conclude that critical analysis of Britain's social predicaments pointed to the need for a more disciplined, coherent national morale, wherein a revitalized spirituality would imbue the material components of civic life in the light of a new &#145;science of politics&#146;. Seeley's professional career would be a quest to determine the necessary religious and intellectual underpinnings of such a science.<h2>
<a name="Eccehomo1865anditsreception"></a>Ecce homo (1865) and its reception</h2>In 1865 appeared, anonymously, <span class="italic">Ecce homo: a Survey of the Life and Work of Jesus Christ</span>. Seeley's authorship was known within the circles familiar with the direction and development of his interests. He preferred anonymity for the wider world on the grounds that he judged his enterprise &#145;audacious and perilous&#146; in the offence it might give both to orthodox Christians and to heterodox non-Christians; and especially to the evangelical piety of his family. His purpose was to suggest by analogy that just as &#145;the drama of ancient society had been played out&#146;, and its traditions and morals and civic values had become obsolete, so too with fretful and distempered modern society. What, he asked, had been &#145;Christ's object in founding the society which is called after his name&#146;, and how was it &#145;adapted to attain that object?&#146; Seeley concluded that a reconsideration of &#145;the speculative commonwealth of Christ&#146; would &#145;add a new chapter to the science of politics&#146;; with implications unmistakably bearing upon the needs of the present. His reconsideration of that commonwealth utilized the new methods of historical and scientific criticism: he confined himself strictly to what the &#145;facts themselves, critically weighed&#146;, appeared to warrant, independently of what the doctors of the church, or even the apostles, had &#145;sealed with their authority&#146;. He concluded, on this methodological premise, that Christ's object, as a new Moses, founder, legislator, and judge, was to constitute a state in which his laws contained not merely practical rules of life but declarations concerning the nature of God and man's relation to Him; wherein Christianity would begin to mean not mere fidelity or loyalty to Christ's person, but practical obedience to his rules of life and unquestioning acceptance of his theological teaching. Such Christianity would encompass liberally a universal ethic of positive morality and the &#145;enthusiasm of humanity&#146;; it would encompass also the &#145;blessed light of science, a light yet far from its meridian and dispersing every day some noxious superstition, some cowardice of the human spirit&#146;  (J. R. Seeley, <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span>, 1866, 33&#150;40, 50, 80, 328).<br>
<br>Twentieth-century commentators, remote from its world of &#145;audacity and peril&#146;, have drawn attention to the thorough topicality of <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span>, its sociological subtext, its being &#145;really an attempt to define the social role of elites&#146;  (Rothblatt, 157). Others have pointed to Seeley's seeking to &#145;reconcile the Positivist faith in science and the conception of a Church of Humanity with Christianity seen as an international ethical society&#146;  (Wormell, 22). Seeley himself disclaimed any controversial intent, avowing that the work was a &#145;fragment&#146; and that a properly theological treatment would be the subject of a further volume. These disclaimers availed little. Christians and secularists alike found cause for offence. Lord Shaftesbury, the evangelical leader, notoriously denounced <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> as a &#145;pestilential&#146; book, fit to have been &#145;vomited from the jaws of hell&#146;. Pusey, Newman, and Sidgwick in their different ways found Seeley's treatment objectionable. Public furore was undoubtedly stimulated by the anonymity of the author. W. E. Gladstone, however, had some &#145;cordial words&#146; to say for it, for which Seeley was grateful. Later, in 1868, Gladstone gave an extensive notice of <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> in <span class="italic">Good Words</span>, granting Seeley's good faith as a &#145;most honourable writer&#146;.<br>
<br>Rather bruised by his ordeal, but nothing daunted as far as his general enterprise was concerned, Seeley shifted the spearhead of his advance towards his goal of a science of politics. Although he developed some of the features set out in <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> (later published in collected form in <span class="italic">Natural Religion</span>, 1882), Seeley abandoned ethical universalism and positivist scientism as the central thrust of his strategy and regrouped his intellectual forces on decidedly national and historical lines. The writing of <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> had impressed on him the extent to which a valid science of politics was only attainable with the assistance of &#145;a well-trained historical imagination, active and yet calm&#146;. The intellectual discipline he found lacking in the moral sciences would be supplied by a scientific approach to history. In this Seeley was inspired by the achievements of the German school of critical history, and by the Prussian achievements both of an idealized state and of consequent military prowess. More direct inspiration came from the Coleridgean national church tradition. &#145;The church as a teacher of morality&#146; was Seeley's contribution to a collection of essays edited by W. L. Clay and published in 1868, <span class="italic">Essays in Church Policy</span>, designed to examine the nature and future role of the Church of England as a national church.<br>
<br>Seeley's premise here was that the province of religion was much more national and political, and much less personal, than was commonly supposed. State and church belonged together, and the link between them was nationality. Morals could not be severed from society. Morality made religion, not religion morality. A higher, ideal, view of service both to the state and from the state must be propagated. If society was to be redeemed from demoralization and political malaise, morality must be taught by a trained &eacute;lite: a version of Coleridgean clerisy, adept not in theology but history. &#145;Patriotism should be inculcated, national history closely connected with morality, and civil duties carefully explained.&#146; The clergy were better positioned than any other profession for such a duty:<blockquote>Carlyle has said that every nation's true <span class="roman">Bible</span> is its history. If the Hebrew history be a cosmopolitan <span class="roman">Bible</span>, or rather the first part of one, I think there should be national <span class="roman">Bibles</span> also, and I can imagine no more proper and nobler task for a clergy than the perpetual shaping and elaborating of such a national monument. (Shannon, 242&#150;6)</blockquote>There was still the positivist touch: &#145;We should form, as it were, a national calendar, consecrate our ancestors&#151;keep their images near us&#146;  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="HistoryatCambridge"></a>History at Cambridge</h2>From a twentieth-century academic viewpoint, Seeley's scheme for a national clerisy seems far more &#145;audacious and perilous&#146; than <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span>. It is a tribute, in its way, to his unabashed directness of mind. The contrast with the mannered archness of Matthew Arnold's <span class="italic">Culture and Anarchy</span> of 1867 could hardly be more marked. It is probable that Gladstone was aware of Seeley's exalted vision of history as a national medium of social morality when, in 1869, on Charles Kingsley's resignation of the regius chair of modern history at Cambridge, the question of replacing him came before the prime minister. That question had come to take to itself a new kind of professional urgency and portent. At Oxford, Stubbs's ambition was to found a historical school in England. His surrogate and eventual successor in the Oxford regius chair, E. A. Freeman, had persecuted Kingsley as an amateur and a romancer. Gladstone was confronted with the task of finding for Cambridge a professor of Stubbsian seriousness of professional purpose. Freeman himself proposed such a person, Adolphus Ward; but Gladstone's principal adviser, Connop Thirlwall, bishop of St David's, had never heard of him. Maurice and Kingsley, both notably Coleridgean churchmen, favoured Seeley; but it was not until Charles Merivale, James Spedding, and Aldis Wright had all declined Gladstone's offers that Seeley's name topped the list of possibles. He was by no means a Stubbs; but a kind of Stubbs might be made out of him. Gladstone assured Maurice that &#145;Of Mr. Seeley's qualities I think very highly&#146;  (Wormell, 42).<br>
<br>Seeley meanwhile had married on 17 August 1869 Mary Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillott (<i>d</i>. 1921), of Unitarian provenance and a relative of Seeley's mathematical colleague at UCL, Augustus De Morgan. It was while on honeymoon vacation at Geneva in September 1869 that Seeley received Gladstone's offer of the regius chair. In accepting he told Gladstone: &#145;I believe there is no position in the world in which I could do so much good&#146;  (Wormell, 42).<br>
<br>Seeley lost little time in communicating to Cambridge his new evangel. In his inaugural lecture in February 1870, &#145;The teaching of politics&#146;, he was ready for direct, aggressive confrontation with the academic establishment. Education, he declared, was in its transition state in Britain. An &#145;artificial value&#146; had for too long been given to classics and mathematics at Cambridge. There had been an illegitimate &#145;protection of particular studies and prohibition of others&#146;, by which &#145;cultivation&#146; had been preferred to &#145;knowledge&#146;. The &#145;old simple routine of Classics and Mathematics&#146; had stifled the claims of those who &#145;make observations and try experiments&#146;, in short, the sciences. Seeley was wholly a believer in Freeman's dictum that &#145;history is past politics and politics present history&#146;. But more than Freeman he wanted to emancipate historical study from the past. It was time that claims should be made for contemporary history. &#145;To turn history away from the past to the present is in fact to give it the interest of an experimental study.&#146; Cambridge was a &#145;great seminary of politicians&#146;. For them history could be made &#145;the school of statesmanship&#146;. The present consisted of &#145;problems which still await their solution, questions which the time is still struggling to answer, controversies in which we are called on to take a side&#146;. Condemning what he called &#145;the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> view of other times&#146;, Seeley emphasized the pedagogic capacity of historical science to &#145;study tendencies before they have reached their limit, predict the growth of power not yet mature, or calculate the stages of its decline&#146;  (Rein, 101&#150;2, 105, 116&#150;18).<br>
<br>As the startled classical dons reeled in ribald shock out of the Senate House, their spokesman, Montagu Butler, headmaster of Harrow and later master of Trinity, is credited with what Sir Geoffrey Elton called &#145;the finest double anti-compliment ever uttered&#146; when he confessed his astonishment &#145;that we should so soon have been regretting poor Kingsley&#146;.<br>
<br>It was Seeley's initial duty at Cambridge to guide the emancipation of history from its despised subsidiary place in the law tripos. History had been ejected from the moral sciences tripos in 1867 and divorce from the law tripos was looming. This was effected in 1873 and the history tripos commenced its small and struggling independent existence. Seeley would have preferred its being entitled the politics tripos, in accordance with his oft-proclaimed doctrine that history was best studied as the foundation of a science of politics. But he was not an effective academic politician. His dislike of the examination system integral to the tripos led to his taking a somewhat Olympian position in relation to the debates and wrangles of the faculty. Seeley was unfortunate in that the don most sympathetic to his prescription of a &#145;Historico-Political Tripos&#146;, both practical and scientific, was Oscar Browning, whose idiosyncrasies made it difficult for him to be taken seriously; while the proponents of &#145;pure&#146; history, of &#145;history for history's sake&#146;, Adolphus Ward, George Prothero, and F. W. Maitland, were all men of acumen. The academic battlelines were drawn, it was said, between Seeley's &#145;thought without facts&#146; and Ward's &#145;facts without thought&#146;. Tripos reform in 1885 led to a decisive shift toward purism. Nor were the Seeleys advantageously at the centre of an agreeable social circle: he lacked anything in the way of lightness of touch; Mrs Seeley was notoriously a scold; and they entertained badly. Seeley's meagre professorial salary in his early years in his chair meant, moreover, that he had to devote much time to supplementing it by extra-mural lecturing. The Seeleys did not move house from London to Cambridge until 1880, after extra endowment for the chair was provided in 1879 by Henry Sidgwick.<h2>
<a name="Stein1878"></a>Stein (1878)</h2>All these academic disadvantages would perhaps have counted for less had Seeley made the intellectual impact he intended with his first, if belated, major published production of a historical study avowedly both practical as to end and scientific as to means, <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Stein, or, Germany and Prussia in the Napoleonic Age</span>, which appeared in three volumes from the Cambridge Press in 1878. With <span class="italic">Stein</span>, Seeley aimed at pulling all the salient lines of his thinking into coherent form. Having established the moral and ethical foundations of a disciplined, patriotic society and an idealized state, he wanted to offer a model of the statesmanship appropriate to such a polity. His anti-models were, precisely, what was currently on offer in Britain: Disraeli, exponent of bankrupt Palmerstonian Turcophilia, grappling unintelligently with Gladstone, hysterical fomentor of populist sentimentality.<br>
<br>Seeley lamented the passing in England of &#145;a national discipline which formed a firm, strongly marked national character&#146;. The old aristocracy had made a virtue of and taken pride in a &#145;cool contempt for sentimentalism and fine phrases&#146;. Now, instead of this &#145;massive strength approaching to brutality&#146;, a &#145;masculine grasp of reality&#146;, Englishmen had acquired all the contrary qualities: &#145;loquacity, sentimentalism, helpless confusion and inaccuracy of thought, hysterical weakness, and the habit of thinking in crowds&#146;  (Shannon, 249). <span class="italic">Stein</span>, Seeley hoped, would diffuse a salutary corrective influence. The reconstructor of the Prussian state after its collapse in 1806 was, in his own way, a kind of new Moses. He embodied both an ideal and a moral conception of the state in his resistance to the immorality and lawlessness of the Napoleonic-Jacobinical universal monarchy. Spain and Prussia, the &#145;immortal ideas of 1808 and 1813&#146;, gave the Europe of nations its correct cue; not the so-called &#145;immortal ideas of 1789&#146;. For Seeley also, a vehement and consistent foe of the papal monarchy, the Prussia of the <i>Kulturkampf</i> was an essential aspect of its ideality. As the Prussia reconstructed by Stein represented the ideal moral state, so her wars were necessarily ideal moral wars: they had &#145;in a manner reconciled the modern world to war, for they have exhibited it as a civilizing agent and a kind of teacher of morals&#146;  (Seeley, <span class="italic">Stein</span>, 2.96).<br>
<br>What might be defined as, in Seeley's view, both the Mosaic legation of Stein and its bearing on the priestly attributes of the true historian was exposed in its most unabashed form in an exchange recorded by Lady Caroline Jebb in her biography of her husband, R. C. Jebb, the classical scholar. Jebb asked Seeley whether he intended to fulfil his undertaking in <span class="italic">Ecce homo</span> to write a study of Christ's divinity:<blockquote>The answer, most unexpected, was to the effect that he had fulfilled this intention already. On being pressed for an explanation, he said that he meant his Life of Stein! His questioner's comment on this &hellip; was that if he had heard this statement attributed to Seeley, he would have scouted it as incredible. (Shannon, 248)</blockquote>Possibly this reflected on Seeley's part defiance of a public which had failed to rise to the intellectual occasion and grasp the point of <span class="italic">Stein</span>. It was not, as Prothero remarked, &#145;one of his most successful productions&#146;. This was all the more irritating to Seeley in that he had taken trouble to ingratiate himself by condescending to the biographical mode. He would have preferred, as a scientist of politics, to have written &#145;philosophical history&#146;, but had elected for &#145;educative purposes&#146; to engage thereby the English mind  (Shannon, 249). It does not seem to have occurred to Seeley that, as Prothero put it, &#145;the character of Stein hardly lends itself to attractive biographical treatment&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<h2>
<a name="TheExpansionofEngland1883"></a>The Expansion of England (1883)</h2>It was, however, when, as a scientist of politics, Seeley sketched out a programme for a future English Stein that he achieved plenary engagement with the English mind. <span class="italic">The Expansion of England</span>, two sets of his lectures delivered in Cambridge, published in 1883, proved an immediate and long-lasting success. (It did not go out of print until 1956: the year, appropriately, as has been pointed out, of the Suez fiasco.) With <span class="italic">Expansion</span>, Seeley combined brilliantly philosophical history with a winningly epigrammatic and stimulating style. In these lectures he followed the logic he had set out in his 1870 inaugural of studying tendencies with a view to prediction and calculation about the future. This capacity was the essence of the practical object for which scientific method was the means. As he had earlier challenged the classicists, so now Seeley challenged popular historians for whom, he considered, English history was gratification of curiosity about the past by means of a celebration of liberty and democracy. But &#145;since the future grows out of the past, the history of the past of England ought to give rise to a prophecy concerning her future&#146;. What prophecy could the historians of liberty and democracy offer? All that &#145;Wilkes and general warrants&#146; could offer was a sense of England's history winding down. Seeley insisted that the<blockquote>history of England ought to end with something that might be called a moral. Some large conclusion ought to arise out of it; it ought to exhibit the general tendency of English affairs in such a way as to set us thinking about the future and divining the destiny which is reserved for us. (J. R. Seeley, <span class="italic">The Expansion of England</span>, ed. J. Gross, 1971, 7)</blockquote>That general tendency Seeley exhibited as the expansion of the English state as a power in the world; that destiny Seeley divined as being reserved was the gathering together of the imperial components into a coherent entity, a &#145;Greater Britain&#146;, which might, as a &#145;World Venice&#146; founded on sea power, preserve Britain's role as a world power in the twentieth century, on a par with the other destined world powers, the United States and Russia. &#145;We seem&#146;, as he put it in a famous sentence, &#145;as it were, to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind&#146;  (J. R. Seeley, <span class="italic">The Expansion of England</span>, ed. J. Gross, 1971, 12). For Seeley the great imperative was that &#145;mind&#146; should be henceforth at the centre of Britain's policy.<br>
<br>Thus Seeley's lesson for the &#145;school of statesmanship&#146;. Hitherto, Seeley had said many big things on direct, simple grounds. At last, with <span class="italic">Expansion</span>, the message made the big, direct, simple impact. Seeley had provided a generation disillusioned alike with Disraelian and Gladstonian politics, and puzzled by Britain's drifting uncertainly in a seemingly incoherent world, with fresh bearings both as to the explanatory shape of the past and to the predictive shape of the future. His last major (and posthumous) publications, especially <span class="italic">The Growth of English Policy</span> (1895), were developments and variations of these Rankean themes of states and powers. Two great statesmen would emerge as claimants for the Mosaic vocation of the Stein of Greater Britain: Chamberlain and Rosebery. Almost the first thing Rosebery did on becoming prime minister in 1894 was to confer a knighthood in the Order of St Michael and St George upon Seeley.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Seeley did not live long to enjoy his honour. He died of cancer at 7 St Peter's Terrace, Cambridge, on 13 January 1895. His health had never been sound. The &#145;slender nervous alert frame&#146; of his youth declined into &#145;a somewhat lethargic exterior&#146; to which &#145;ill-health had brought an almost excessive gravity of deportment and bearing which at first sight might almost be mistaken for hesitation or inertness&#146;  (Wormell, 8). His wife, it was generally agreed, was no great helpmate; and for domestic comfort he depended increasingly upon their one child, Frances Seeley. In 1882, under new statutes providing for quotas of professorial fellows in colleges, Seeley was elected to a fellowship in Gonville and Caius College, whose amenities he valued greatly. The history faculty he served honestly within his lights. He watched it grow from academic infancy to successful maturity, though he failed to imprint upon it his own vision as to its higher vocation. He was always an acclaimed and popular lecturer, and took an important initiative in establishing a seminar for advanced students. Seeley offended the young George Macaulay Trevelyan by dismissing Trevelyan's revered great-uncle as a charlatan and a litt&eacute;rateur. Yet it would be Trevelyan who would, with his <span class="italic">English Social History</span> (1944), write the next great best-seller of the Cambridge school. Trevelyan characterized Seeley as a &#145;fine old Victorian of a fighting, dogmatic breed&#146;  (G. M. Trevelyan, <span class="italic">An Autobiography and Other Essays</span>, 1949, 17). Certainly Seeley fought for the cause of imperial federation and against the cause of Irish home rule. Certainly he was dogmatic in his conviction as to historical means to political ends. And certainly he was Victorian in the sense that he handed on no professional intellectual legacy to the post-Victorian world other than the abiding popularity of his <span class="italic">Expansion of England</span>; which in any case came to be seen as something like the British empire itself, left over from the Victorian era, increasingly disembodied in time and space. By a kind of fatal irony, Seeley failed to predict that his admired Germany would insist on claiming its own destiny in <i>Weltpolitik</i>; that Providence had not ordered the future for the exclusive convenience of Greater Britain. It is Seeley's ironic fate to be of interest now to historians on grounds he would have repudiated as &#145;curiosity&#146; or &#145;purism&#146;. Yet it is by no means curiously anomalous that the history faculty library at Cambridge is named in his memory. As one of his most distinguished successors in the regius chair, Sir Geoffrey Elton, pointed out, Sir John Seeley was Cambridge's first truly notable regius professor of modern history.<br>
