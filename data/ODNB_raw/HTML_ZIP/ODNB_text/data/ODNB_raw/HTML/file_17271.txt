<span class="headword">Lynn,  Walter</span>  (1677/8&#150;1763), <span class="occ">physician and inventor of a fire engine</span>, was born at Southwick House, near Oundle, Northamptonshire, the third son of George Lynn (1647/8&#150;1682), and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1722), eldest daughter of Walter Johnson, of Spalding, Lincolnshire. He had a twin sister, and was the younger brother of the astronomer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17267/', "George Lynn")</script>. He went to school at Spalding, and then to Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1695 (BA 1699, MB 1704). He was in York in 1710, and published <span class="italic">An Essay towards a More Easie and Safe Method of Cure in the Small Pox</span> (1714), in which he described his own case of the disease. He produced a further work on smallpox in 1715. Lynn lodged for a time in Daker Street, Westminster, and said he had a sincere intention to serve the public, particularly ladies and the gentry, but found this impossible, partly because of his poor constitution. In addition, he had no licence to practise physic in London and, although advised by John Mapletoft to get a licence, did not feel fit to do so.<br>
<br>Lynn therefore diverted himself with mechanics and the performance of music. In 1712 he was elected an extra regular member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding. He wrote a satire <span class="italic">Nyktopsia, or, The Use and Abuse of Snuffers</span> (1726), and in the same year printed <span class="italic">The case of Walter Lynn, M.B., in relation to divers undertakings of his, particularly for the improvement of an engine to raise water by fire</span>. This was to be an improvement on Captain Thomas Savory's engine, and Lynn hoped for but did not get a reward from parliament. <span class="italic">The Case</span> does not say what the improvements were. Lynn had submitted his invention to Isaac Newton, Christopher Wren, Wren's son, and Brook Taylor. Despite the backing of Christopher Wren, among others, Lynn was disappointed in his hope that the Royal Society would try out his engine. He denied that if his engine lessened the expense of fuel, Newcastle trade would be less, and seamen's employment diminished.<br>
<br>Lynn said others found him &#145;morose, lazy, discontented and melancholy&#146;  (Axon, 241). He died in March 1763, apparently aged eighty-five, and was buried on 19 March at Grantham, Lincolnshire.<br>
