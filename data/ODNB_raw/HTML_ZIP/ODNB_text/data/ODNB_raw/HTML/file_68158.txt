<span class="headword">Churchman,  John</span>  (1705&#150;1775), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and journal writer</span>, was born on 4 August 1705 at Nottingham, Chester county, Pennsylvania, the son of John Churchman (<i>d</i>. 1724), farmer, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cerie. He was a lifelong resident of Nottingham and deeply involved with the Religious Society of Friends. In his journal he said that he &#145;was born in a wilderness place&#146; and, of his education, that he &#145;had been at a school but about three months, and the man I went to being a weaver, sat in his loom and heard his scholars read&#146;  (<span class="italic">Account</span>, 73).<br>
<br>At the age of nineteen Churchman said he was concerned for &#145;the good order of the church&#146; and became conscientious in attending meetings for business and discipline, both in his neighbourhood and elsewhere. Aged twenty-six he reluctantly became an elder but was so scrupulous in the administration of his duties that he was replaced at the next quarterly meeting. On 27 November 1729 he married Margaret Brown (1707&#150;1770), daughter of William and Esther Brown of Chester county, Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>After suffering a fit of despondency in 1748 Churchman was promoted for justice of peace by some of his associates. However, he declined the honour &#145;because God wanted him to avoid worldly cumbers&#146;  (Marietta, 33). In the same year Churchman addressed the assembly at the state house in Philadelphia on the subject of the war tax and slavery. Churchman was concerned that Quakers should in no way be involved with King George's War and joined those who refused to pay the tax levied by Pennsylvania to conduct the war on the grounds that it was inconsistent with the Quaker peace testimony.<br>
<br>The next year (1749) Churchman felt compelled to visit Britain and the Netherlands in the service of &#145;Truth&#146;. He spent four years abroad and attended numerous Quaker gatherings; it is estimated that he covered over 9000 miles by land and was present at more than 1000 meetings. In England, as in America, Churchman felt that Friends too often had modified traditional values. Some English Friends found him &#145;singular and narrow&#146; and expected from one who had travelled so far some verbal ministry. However, Churchman often decided to remain silent. He was steadfast in his anxiety over a growing worldliness among Friends, and favoured a strict enforcement of Quaker discipline, which some felt was unbending.<br>
<br>One English Friend who shared Churchman's views was Samuel Fothergill (1715&#150;1772), brother of the famous physician John Fothergill. When Churchman returned to America, Fothergill went with him. Unlike Churchman, Fothergill was an eloquent preacher, who in his time in America (1754&#150;6) joined Churchman in strengthening discipline among Friends. With Fothergill and other English Friends, Churchman also succeeded in 1754 in creating yearly meetings for ministers and elders.<br>
<br>In 1759 Churchman visited some active members of the society who kept slaves to confront them with the implications of their practice; he was accompanied by the Quaker essayist and anti-slavery campaigner John Woolman. Churchman and Woolman shared many attitudes and cares, and both left important religious autobiographies. Sometimes their writing overlapped, and there is some evidence that Churchman was a little jealous of the younger and more charismatic Woolman. Whereas Woolman's <span class="italic">Journal</span> remains a delight to read Churchman's <span class="italic">Account</span> is too often unimaginative and excessively didactic. Comparing the two, Daniel B. Shea jun. says that Churchman remained a &#145;peerless didact &hellip; whose intention in writing was &#147;to encourage the humbled, carefull traveller in the way of his duty&#148;&#146;  (Shea, 257&#150;8).<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Journal</span> Woolman honoured Churchman by including long extracts of unpublished notes from his &#145;beloved friend&#146;. Many of these concerned Churchman's 1748 appearance at the state house. There Churchman eloquently reminded the representatives:<blockquote>May it with gratitude be ever remembered how remarkably we have been preserved in peace and tranquillity for more than fifty years: no invasion by foreign enemies, and the treaties of peace with the natives, wisely begun by our proprietor William Penn, preserved inviolable to this day. (<span class="italic">Journal and Essays of John Woolman</span>, ed. Gummere, 80)</blockquote>Seven years later matters had changed drastically and the non-Quaker authorities were basically at war with the Native Americans in Pennsylvania. Churchman and like-minded Friends were &#145;raising money to cultivate our friendship with our Indian neighbours, and to support such of our fellow subjects who are or may be in distress&#146;  (ibid., 82). It was a policy few non-Quakers were willing to join and the sad future destiny of the Native Americans was set.<br>
<br>For a long time Churchman, like Woolman, had accepted the Native Americans as equals. In a dream of angels, recorded in his <span class="italic">Account</span>, Churchman recalled that &#145;the complexion of the angelic apparition &hellip; was not much different from one of the Indians clear washed from his grease and filth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Account</span>, 185). Unlike those who viewed the Native Americans as basically subhuman Churchman believed that the Spirit dwelt in men of all colours; his dream signified that man should examine deeper than outward appearance.<br>
<br>In general Churchman's reputation suffers by comparison with Woolman; Churchman's tensions between the personal and the didactic impersonal are far less resolved and, though both men were notably self-effacing, somehow Woolman reveals himself more fully, and a more accessible soul emerges. Both men were dedicated to particular causes; Woolman's was the abolition of slavery, and Churchman's was the discipline of the Society of Friends. Daniel Shea writes, &#145;A good life preaches its own sermon Churchman seems to say&#146;  (Shea, 12). Few others of his time were more exemplary in their conduct, and Jack Marietta credits Churchman with being &#145;the first person to have expressed a hope to reform the Society and to have begun working at it&#146;  (Marietta, 32).<br>
<br>Like Woolman, Churchman had always suffered from a weak constitution; he was ill for three weeks with fever before his death on 24 July 1775. He died in his chair, apparently declaring near the time, &#145;I feel that which lies beyond death and the grave, which is now an inexpressible comfort to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal and Essays of John Woolman</span>, ed. Gummere, 542). He was buried at East Nottingham Friends' burial-ground two days later. Churchman's legacy continued in his son George (1730&#150;1814), who became a leading force among Pennsylvania Quakers. George Churchman was inspired by Samuel Fothergill's preaching and was both a pioneer in promoting Friends' schools as well as clerk of Philadelphia yearly meeting.<br>
