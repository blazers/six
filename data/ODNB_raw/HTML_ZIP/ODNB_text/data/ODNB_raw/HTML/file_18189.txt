<span class="headword">Martin, Sir  James Ranald</span>  (1793&#150;1874), <span class="occ">surgeon and medical administrator</span>, was born on 12 May 1793, the son of the Revd Donald Martin of Kilmuir, the Isle of Skye. After the death of his mother, which occurred when he was very young, the family left for Inverness, where Martin attended school at the Royal Academy. His father and maternal grandfather desired that he should pursue a military career, but Martin showed an inclination towards medicine from an early stage and received instruction in pharmacy from two local doctors while still attending school.<br>
<br>In 1813 Martin left Inverness for London, where he became a student at St George's Hospital, studying under the renowned surgeon Sir Everard Home. In 1817, having become a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, he secured a position with the East India Company, and left for India in June of that year. His first appointment was at the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, where he treated European civilians, but in 1818 he began military service with the company's army at Fort William. Promoted to the rank of assistant surgeon, Martin soon left Calcutta for Orissa, which was in a state of revolt. Here, he served in various engagements, coping not only with the injuries of war but with high levels of sickness among the troops. Martin also became embroiled in the controversy over flogging in the army, and successfully opposed the cruelties inflicted on Indian troops by some of the more vindictive British officers.<br>
<br>Martin returned to Calcutta in 1819 as first assistant surgeon in the General Hospital but in 1820 resumed military duties, taking charge of the Ramgarh battalion during operations against hill tribes in northern Bengal. It was here that he contracted a fever which was to impair his health for the next ten months, but this experience led him to propose measures to prevent disease in the battalion, including the siting of camps in more elevated and &#145;healthy&#146; positions. The campaign impressed on him the importance of the environment in the causation of disease and stirred a lifelong interest in medical topography. By 1821 Martin had returned to Calcutta, where he recommended improvements to the regimental hospital and barracks, as well as other sanitary measures&#151;most of which were adopted by the governor-general, the marquess of Hastings. But fever and arduous campaigning had taken its toll on Martin's health and he was ordered to the island of Mauritius to recuperate.<br>
<br>Martin returned to Calcutta in 1823 but shortly afterwards was to serve in the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824&#150;6. Immediately after the war Martin married the daughter of Colonel Paton CB, the quartermaster-general of the Bengal army, and settled down in Calcutta where he rapidly established the city's largest civilian practice. A further measure of his standing was his appointment in 1828 to the post of presidency surgeon; a position which he combined with his private practice and the head surgeoncy of the Native Hospital in Calcutta. It was at this institution that he developed a radical&#151;and subsequently widely adopted&#151;cure for hydrocephalus by the injection of diluted tincture of iodine. Martin also continued to interest himself in sanitary matters, and in 1835 won the support of the governor-general William Bentinck in his appeal for more medical topographical reports of Indian stations. Two years later Martin published his own <span class="italic">Medical Topography of Calcutta</span>, a book which marks a turning point in Anglo-Indian medicine. It was here that Martin began to turn his attention from the effects of climate on health to the sanitary condition of Indian towns. Unlike earlier writers, Martin deplored Indian sanitary habits and drew heavily on James Mill's utilitarian critique of oriental &#145;superstitions&#146;. The book epitomized a new feeling among British doctors and administrators that western medicine was essential to India's civilization and progress.<br>
<br>Martin continued to practise in Calcutta until 1840, when his deteriorating health forced him to retire to England. He took a house in Grosvenor Street and then at Upper Brook Street, London, where he established a practice among friends and acquaintances from his time in India. He now devoted himself to devising numerous schemes for improving the health of soldiers and was employed as inspector-general of army hospitals and as president of the East India Company's medical board. He also published a series of lectures in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> on the diseases of tropical climates and edited the seventh edition of James Johnson's widely respected work, <span class="italic">The Influence of Tropical Climates on European Constitutions</span>, published in 1856. In 1857, following the Crimean War, Martin was appointed to the royal commission inquiring into the sanitary state of the British army and, in 1859, to a similar body investigating the health of the army in India.<br>
<br>Martin was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1845, and was made a CB in 1860 and knighted later that year. He is said to have been a handsome man, over 6 feet tall, strongly built, and with a military air and appearance. He became somewhat deaf in old age but discharged his official duties until his death from pneumonia at his home at 37 Upper Brook Street, London, on 27 November 1874.<br>
