<span class="headword">Stuart,  B&eacute;rault</span> <span class="st"> [Bernard Stuart or Stewart]</span>  (1452/3&#150;1508), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54329/', "John Stewart (d. c.1469), seigneur d'Aubigny")</script> (Aubigny-sur-N&egrave;re, near Bourges) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26714/', "Stewart, Sir John, of Darnley")</script>], and of B&eacute;atrice, daughter of B&eacute;rault, seigneur d'Apchier. His grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26714/', "John Stewart of Darnley")</script>, had disembarked at La Rochelle in October 1419 at the head of a contingent of Scotsmen, in support of Charles, then regent of the kingdom of France: in 1423 Charles, having become king, gave him the <i>seigneurie</i> of Aubigny. John Stewart of Darnley was constable of the Scottish army in France from 1421 to 1429: in the latter year he received from the king the right to quarter his arms with those of France.<br>
<br>B&eacute;rault Stuart was a man-at-arms in the regular Scottish company in 1469. In 1483 he received command of a company of 100 lances, and in the same year was appointed castellan of the castle of the Bois de Vincennes. He was sent to Scotland in 1484 to announce the accession of Charles VII (<i>d</i>. 1498) to James III (<i>d</i>. 1488) and added his signature to the treaty renewing the &#145;auld alliance&#146;. In 1485 he was placed at the head of the French mercenaries who fought on the side of Henry Tudor at the battle of Bosworth. He acted as <i>bailli</i> of Berry from 1487 to 1498, and became seigneur d'Aubigny on the death of his father. For most of his life he styled himself counsellor and chamberlain of the king of France. In 1491 he was charged with setting free Louis, duke of Orl&eacute;ans (the future Louis XII), until then held prisoner by Charles VIII. The annual pension which he received from the king rose to 3000 livres tournois in the years 1491, 1492, and 1493. Also in 1491 he went to Milan on a diplomatic mission to Lodovico Sforza (<i>d</i>. 1510); he was with Ferdinand of Aragon at the taking of Granada in 1492. From that year to 1508 he was captain of Harfleur and of Montivilliers. He became a knight of the order of St Michel in 1492. In the following year he was appointed captain of Charles VIII's Scottish guard, a post he retained until his death. In 1494 he married Anne de Maumont, daughter of Jean d'Alen&ccedil;on, bastard of Jean (II), duke of Alen&ccedil;on: from this marriage was born Anne, who became the wife of Robert Stewart, future marshal of France and seigneur d'Aubigny. In the same year, several months before the beginning of his expedition to Italy, Charles VIII sent Stuart on a mission to Milan, Ferrara, Mantua, Florence, and Rome. He conducted a campaign in the Romagna, then rejoined Charles's army and made his entry into Florence on 15 November 1494. Stuart took part in the conquest of Calabria. Charles made him grand constable of the kingdom of Naples, and in this capacity he found himself entrusted with the defence of Calabria against the Aragonese. With his Swiss troops he defeated King Ferdinand and Gonzalve de Cordoba at Seminara on 21 June 1495, but he was soon on the defensive and was forced to leave the kingdom of Naples with his army and return to France in 1497. In consideration of his distinguished service Charles VIII granted him a reward of 12,000 livres tournois. His pension at this time was 1800 livres tournois.<br>
<br>Stuart remained in favour with Charles's successor, Louis XII (<i>d</i>. 1515), who by 1500 had increased his pension to 4000 livres tournois. He conducted a campaign against Lodovico Sforza in northern Italy in 1499, and in 1500 he was named one of the governors of Milan. In the following year he was entrusted by the king with a new expedition against the kingdom of Naples; he took the city of Capua by assault and entered Naples. Fighting against the Spanish continued in 1502, when he won a victory at Terranova, but the following year he was defeated at Seminara on 21 April. He was taken prisoner on the capitulation of Rocca Angistola and incarcerated in the Castel Nuovo at Naples, but was freed following the suspension of hostilities. He then returned to France, where he evidently retained the sovereign's favour. He took part in the expedition against Genoa in 1507. Having fallen ill at Savona he received a visit from Ferdinand of Aragon, who paid homage to his legendary courage. In 1508 he decided to make a pilgrimage to the sanctuary of St Ninian at Whithorn in Scotland. Louis XII charged him on that occasion with an embassy to the Scottish king, James IV (<i>d</i>. 1513), intended principally to renew the &#145;auld alliance&#146;. Having passed through London in great pomp on 21 March, he reached Scotland. He and the Scottish king, who dubbed him &#145;father of war&#146;, exchanged gifts, notably of horses. To celebrate his arrival William Dunbar (<i>d</i>. 1530) wrote a ballad in which he was compared to Achilles, Hector, Hannibal, and Arthur, and lauded as the &#145;most strong, incomparable knyght, the fame of the armys and the floure of vassalage&#146;  (Dunbar, 109). Stuart finally left on his pilgrimage, but he fell ill and died at Corstorphine, near Edinburgh. In his will, dated 8 June, he asked to be buried in the house of the Observant Franciscans in Edinburgh, while his heart was to be sent to St Ninian's. James IV wrote a letter of condolence to Queen Anne of France, while Dunbar composed an elegy on him addressed to Louis XII.<br>
<br>In the course of his final embassy Stuart dictated to his secretary and household chaplain &Eacute;tienne le Jeune, a native of Aubigny, a treatise on the art of war that borrowed its essentials from the work of a French captain, Robert de Balsac, composed some years earlier, but Stuart added a number of details on the basis of his military experience in the kingdom of Naples. Philippe de Commines wrote of him: &#145;Monseigneur d'Aubigny, of the Scottish nation, good and wise and honourable knight&#146;  (Commines, 3.136). In fact he was at once both a good diplomat and an experienced war captain, though for the greater part of his life he suffered from gout, which often forced him to interrupt his activities. Of all his merits the chronicler Jean d'Auton praises in particular his reconnaissance of terrain: &#145;In the matter of war he was the master of all others in spying out the countryside and dealing with ambushes&#146;  (Auton, 2.265). His arms were a quartered escutcheon, the first and fourth quarters azure, three fleurs-de-lis or, the second and third a fess checky azure and argent. There is a medal of him by the engraver Nicol&ograve; Spinelli. In a manuscript that belonged to him (<span class="italic">Le livre du gouvernement des princes</span>, a French translation of Giles of Rome's <span class="italic">De regimine principum</span>; Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que de l'Arsenal, MS 6328), a miniature represents him in armour, haughty, mounted on a barded horse, and brandishing in his right hand his baton of command.<br>
