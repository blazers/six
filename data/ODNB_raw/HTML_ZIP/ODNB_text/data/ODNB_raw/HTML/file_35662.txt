<span class="headword">Ramsay, Sir  James Henry</span>, tenth baronet  (1832&#150;1925), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23082/', "Sir George Ramsay, ninth baronet (1800&#150;1871)")</script>, a philosopher, and Emily Eugenia (1806&#150;1885), daughter of Captain Henry Lennon, of co. Westmeath. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23102/', "William Ramsay (1806&#150;1865)")</script>, the classicist, was his uncle. He was born at Versailles on 21 May 1832, and educated at Rugby School and at Christ Church, Oxford. He was awarded a second class in classical moderations in 1853, a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1854, and a first in law and modern history in 1855. He was elected a student of Christ Church in 1854, but gave up that position in 1861 on his marriage on 24 July to Mary (<i>d</i>. 1868), daughter of William Scott Kerr, of Chatto and Sunlaws, Roxburghshire. There were three daughters of the marriage. Ramsay was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1863, but he does not appear to have practised.<br>
<br>In 1867&#150;9 Ramsay was appointed as an examiner in the Oxford school of law and modern history, and this experience convinced him that the current books on English political history were unsatisfactory. He records in his diary that in December 1869 he consulted Dean Henry Liddell, of Christ Church, on his intention to write a history of England. The necessary leisure and financial support were supplied in 1871, when he succeeded to the baronetcy and estates of Bamff, near Alyth in Perthshire.<br>
<br>For a while, Ramsay was tempted to enter politics, and in 1872 he stood unsuccessfully for Forfarshire in the Liberal interest. Thereafter, although he continued to take a keen interest in politics, his activity was limited to local affairs. He had by this time settled down to writing a history of England from 55 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to 1485&#151;the period covered, from a different angle, by William Stubbs. However, while Stubbs lived an active academic and ecclesiastical life, in contact with other scholars and with practical problems, Ramsay was a solitary scholar. However despite his dedication to his work, he enjoyed and excelled in outdoor recreations. With a short sturdy figure, he was an admirable walker, skater, and mountaineer. With his brother George, Ramsay was a keen member of the Alpine Club, and he became a pioneer in ascending Mont Blanc from the Italian side. On 20 August 1873 Ramsay married Charlotte Fanning (<i>d</i>. 1904), daughter of Major William Stewart, of Ardvorlich; there were two sons and three more daughters of the marriage, and Ramsay's elder daughters later gave him valuable assistance in his historical work.<br>
<br>For twenty years the only visible products of Ramsay's labours were a series of articles in <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>. Then, in 1892, the first two volumes of Ramsay's work were issued. This instalment was, curiously, the concluding part, entitled <span class="italic">Lancaster and York: a Century of English History, 1399&#150;1485</span>. Six years later, in 1898, two further volumes appeared, under the title <span class="italic">The Foundations of England</span>, covering the period from 55 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1154. Succeeding volumes followed in chronological order: <span class="italic">The Angevin Empire, 1154&#150;1216</span>, in 1903; <span class="italic">The Dawn of the Constitution, 1216&#150;1307</span>, in 1908; and <span class="italic">The Genesis of Lancaster, 1307&#150;1399</span>, in 1913.<br>
<br>Ramsay's avowed intention was to provide a verified and chronological narrative of political history, written around the king as the central figure. He gave, as far as possible, exact, authenticated references to the original authorities on which each statement rested, so that readers might have the material for forming independent judgements. This was the kind of guidance provided by the <span class="italic">Jahrb&uuml;cher des deutschen Reiches</span>, differing in that he had less charter material, but made use of the invaluable financial rolls in the Public Record Office. His books had the defects as well as the qualities of good annals; lucid and concise, they were somewhat arid. Although he kept abreast of the work of other British scholars as it appeared, he failed to give attention to the findings of German and French historians; and inevitably there were misconceptions, especially in the early volumes. His books found a place in university and college libraries principally as works of reference, though some private scholars found the clarity and directness of the narrative enjoyable. One of his special interests was military history, and he based his battle narratives on personal visits to the sites. In this field his principal contribution was his insistence on the small size of medieval armies. A contemporary who heard him speak on the subject in 1913 remembered with admiration &#145;the vigour and vivacity with which the octogenarian scholar upheld his views&#146;  (Tout, 482).<br>
<br>Ramsay's most original contribution to knowledge was the work he did on the revenues of the kings of England, based on his study of the issue rolls, receipt rolls, and enrolled customs accounts in the Public Record Office. Although he did not make use of all the available records, such as the calendars of chancery rolls, and was only partly familiar with the technicalities of exchequer accounting, his work was an important pioneering attempt to break into a new area of study. He achieved his aim of opening up the subject for further research by other scholars. This proved to be his most lasting historical achievement.<br>
<br>After the completion of his <i>magnum opus</i> Ramsay employed his leisure in editing, largely from the family charter box, <span class="italic">The Bamff Charters and Papers</span> (1915). He also put together his researches on medieval finance, which were published as <span class="italic">A History of the Revenues of the Kings of England, 1066&#150;1399</span> (1925).<br>
<br>Ramsay's work received some public recognition. The University of Glasgow conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD in 1906. Cambridge gave him an honorary DLitt two years later, and he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1915.<br>
<br>Apart from his historical work, Ramsay's chief interest was in his family. He was a resolute advocate of the education of women, and a keen supporter of St Leonard's Girls' School at St Andrews, to which he sent four of his daughters. He was immensely gratified by the success of his third daughter by his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45783/', "Agnata Frances Butler (1867&#150;1931)")</script>, who was placed by the examiners above the senior classic at Cambridge in 1887. Ramsay's last appearance at a political meeting took place when his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36301/', "Katharine Stewart-Murray, duchess of Atholl (1874&#150;1960)")</script>, was nominated as candidate for the division of Kinross and West Perthshire in 1923. He died at Bamff on 17 February 1925, and was buried at Alyth on 21 February. He was succeeded as eleventh baronet by his only surviving son, James Douglas (<i>b</i>. 1878).<br>
