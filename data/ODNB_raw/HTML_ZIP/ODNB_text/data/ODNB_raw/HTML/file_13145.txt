<span class="headword">Hewett, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1508&#150;1567), <span class="occ">mayor of London</span>, was born in the hamlet of Laughton-en-le-Morthen in the West Riding of Yorkshire to Edmund Hewett, whose family hailed from Derbyshire. Hewett served an apprenticeship to a clothworker from <i>c</i>.1522 and was admitted to the freedom of the Clothworkers' Company of London at some time before 1529, when he began taking apprentices himself. Like other textilers, he was also a merchant adventurer. Several relatives, including his brother Thomas and nephew Henry, migrated from Yorkshire to work in his successful business on Candlewick Street. Stow estimated Hewett's worth at &pound;6000 per year at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Hewett became master of the Clothworkers' Company in 1543, but when he was elected alderman of Vintry ward on 16 September 1550, he refused to serve in office. The court of aldermen remanded him to Newgate, which seems to have changed his perspective about civic responsibility. Hewett represented Vintry until July 1554 and then transferred to Candlewick ward. He was elected sheriff in 1553 and, with other city leaders, countersigned the letters patent of Edward VI leaving the crown to Lady Jane Grey. Just a few months later Hewett carried out the sentences of execution on Lady Jane and her husband after Thomas Wyatt's rebellion. Given the dangers of political prominence, Hewett resisted mayoral duties until prevailed upon by a committee appointed in June 1557 to persuade him. In September 1559 he became lord mayor, the first member of the Clothworkers' Company to attain the office and the first mayor elected after the accession of Elizabeth I. As was the custom, accompanied by scarlet-clad aldermen, he was knighted by the queen after travelling by water to the court in Greenwich on 21 January 1560.<br>
<br>Hewett's new post imposed many responsibilities. The privy council directed him to reform the city's morality by enforcing sumptuary laws, ending gaming, and persuading retailers to moderate their prices; he was to make weekly reports. Hewett also presided at the treason trial of Captain Chamberlain, commander of the castle in Calais, on 8 June 1560. The queen instructed Hewett later that year to affix the marks of a greyhound and portcullis to the silver testons in circulation in order to detect counterfeit money. In August 1562, along with other prominent Londoners, Hewett sat in judgment on several counterfeiters at the Guildhall; four were condemned to death.<br>
<br>At some time after 1536 Hewett married Alice, the third daughter of Nicholas Leveson of Halling, Kent, a rich London mercer who was chosen sheriff in 1534. She was known for her pious and charitable works. The Hewetts had several children, but only Anne, born in 1543, survived her parents. Stow recounts that young Anne, playing near a window in her family house on London Bridge, fell into the river and was rescued by Edward Osborne, her father's apprentice, whom she later wed. Later historians called the story apocryphal, since the date attributed to the incident, 1536, is before the Hewetts' wedding, and as there is no evidence that the family ever lived on London Bridge. None the less, Osborne, later lord mayor himself, did marry Anne Hewett and inherited through her most of her father's estates. Lady Alice Hewett died on 8 April 1561 and was buried at St Martin Orgar.<br>
<br>Hewett lived in Philpot Lane, but also had a country house at Highgate; in 1565 he served as one of the governors of Sir Roger Cholmeley's newly established grammar school there. His name appears on the register of admissions to Gray's Inn and his arms, inscribed with his name, are in Gray's Inn Hall. Hewett's enterprises embroiled him in litigation on occasion. John Isham, London mercer and fellow merchant adventurer, sued him for debts; Hewett sought to collect &pound;2000 from William, Lord Dacre, in 1558 and received judgment in the exchequer following arbitration by the privy council. He represented George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury, at the baptism of Robert Dethyke, son of Sir Gilbert Dethick or Dethyke, at St Giles Cripplegate in July 1561. He also acted as a business agent for the earl: raising money, sending in accounts, and in 1563 reminding Shrewsbury that the earl's house in London needed repair. Hewett owned Parsloes Manor in Dagenham, Essex, and various estates in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire. He died on 25 January 1567 in London and was buried next to his wife in St Martin Orgar. His will, dated 3 January 1567, was proved on 11 March 1567. He bequeathed his business, at the sign of the Three Cranes in Candlewick Street, to Thomas and Henry Hewett, and to Anne Osborne his tenements in London and Canterbury.<br>
