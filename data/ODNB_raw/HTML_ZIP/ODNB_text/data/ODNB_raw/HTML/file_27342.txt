<span class="headword">Thorndike,  Herbert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1597?, <em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and theologian</span>, was probably baptized on 16 April 1597 at Cumberworth, Lincolnshire, the third of four sons of Francis Thorndike (<i>d</i>. 1645) of Scamblesby in the same county, and of his wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1623), daughter of Edward Coleman of Waldingfield, Suffolk. Like his father he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he matriculated as a pensioner in Michaelmas term 1613. He became a scholar in 1614, graduated BA in 1617, and proceeded MA in 1620, when he was incorporated at Oxford. In the 1620s he acted as deputy to his friend and colleague George Herbert, public orator in the university until 1627. He was a university preacher in 1631 and served as proctor in 1638&#150;9. His interest in Near and Middle Eastern languages was evidenced in his <span class="italic">Epitome lexici Hebraici, Syriaci, rabinici et Arabici</span> (1635), and in 1640 he was Hebrew lecturer at Trinity. Ordained priest, he was a prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral from 1636 to 1640 and vicar of Claybrooke, Leicestershire, from 1639 to 1642, but he continued to reside in Cambridge.<br>
<br>When traditional episcopal government was under attack in the Long Parliament in 1641, Thorndike published <span class="italic">Of the Government of Churches: a Discourse Pointing at the Primitive Form</span>. Like Archbishop James Ussher's <span class="italic">Judgement of Doctor Rainolds Touching the Originall of Episcopacy</span> of the same year, it presented a historical case that the apostles had appointed presbyters to serve the churches they had founded and that they were then succeeded by bishops, who presided over groups of presbyters in the major cities of the ancient Mediterranean world. Current circumstances, Thorndike contended, demanded not the abolition of the episcopate but the restoration of presbyters (priests, in the language of the church's ordinal) to their role of assisting bishops, perhaps by associating the latter more closely with their cathedral chapters. His <span class="italic">Of Religious Assemblies and the Public Service of God</span> (1642), which drew extensively on Hebrew and Greek sources, defended the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> as providing services that were consistent with biblical and ancient models. He rejected the Roman Catholic doctrines of the sacrifice of the mass and of transubstantiation, while he cited approvingly Calvin's teaching that the Lord's supper should be celebrated frequently.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of civil war in 1642, Thorndike, who that year became senior bursar of his college as well as rector of Barley, Hertfordshire, was among a number of Cambridge scholars considered dangerous by parliamentary leaders. In September 1643 he was the leading candidate for master in a closely contested election at Sidney Sussex College, but parliamentary soldiers seized and carried off John Pawson, a fellow who supported Thorndike, thus throwing the election to Richard Minshull. Subsequently Thorndike lost not only his fellowship at Trinity but also, some time before 31 May 1645, his living at Barley. By 1648 Thorndike was associated with Sir Justinian Isham of Lamport, Northamptonshire, a royalist whom he assisted with advice about book purchases; in the late 1650s he was a guest at Isham's country house. He was also among &#145;distressed clergy&#146; assisted by John Scudamore, Viscount Scudamore. According to his biographer Arthur Haddan, despite his expulsion, Trinity College gave him money in 1649, 1650, 1651, 1654, and 1659.<br>
<br>These years of dislocation were a time of remarkable achievement for Thorndike as a scholar and writer. In the wake of parliament's abolition of episcopacy and ban on the public use of the prayer book, he published <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Right of the Church in a Christian State</span> (1649). Departing from the tradition of Richard Hooker and other conformist writers, he attempted to distinguish the appropriate spheres of responsibility of the church and the civil government. Referring several times to Thomas Hobbes's <span class="italic">De cive</span> (1642), he described the church as a society with its own organization and activities, chiefly assembling for worship, which it was bound to continue against, if necessary, all the civil law in the world. In a Christian state, he argued, it was appropriate for the civil authorities to regulate the church's external affairs, but they could not by right alter the church's polity or curtail its spiritual functions; bishops were those who exercised the highest ecclesiastical power in the church and must be left in place. In 1650, Thorndike's earlier treatises on the government of the church and on Christian worship were reissued in Cambridge with a &#145;review&#146;, answering objections that had been raised, under the title <span class="italic">Two Discourses</span>. His <span class="italic">Letter Concerning the Present State of Religion</span> (1656) advised his correspondent to have nothing to do with any pastor intruded in his parish church under the terms of the ordinance setting up &#145;triers&#146; for ejecting scandalous ministers and those who adhered to &#145;Popery and Prelacy&#146;  (p. 1). To Thorndike, the ordinance contradicted the idea of &#145;one holy Catholic and apostolic church&#146; in its rejection of those clergy committed to the historic episcopate, especially since they fulfilled its other criterion of profession of faith in Jesus Christ according to the scriptures. Indeed, he concluded that it also violated presbyterian and congregational polity. However, he reassured his correspondent that he could find clergy of the pre-war church who were willing to catechize children and administer the sacraments, and that, in any case, he had the prayer book, homilies, and scriptures authorized by that church and could use them in private.<br>
<br>From the early 1650s Thorndike had been working as one of the chief compilers of the edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in its original languages, prepared under the direction of Brian Walton and published as <span class="italic">Biblia sacra polyglotta</span> (1657); he had special responsibility for the Syriac portion. Soon after its appearance, in 1657&#150;8, he considered an invitation from William Sancroft, a former fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, to migrate to the Netherlands, but did not immediately accept, probably because he wanted to stay in London, where he was busy with his scholarly projects. Thorndike did go abroad in late November 1659 to visit Isaac Vosius, the Dutch classicist and patristics scholar, and to search for manuscripts, particularly of the writings of the ancient Greek Christian theologian Origen. He obtained from Vosius the <span class="italic">Codex Holmiensis</span>, containing the only complete Greek text of Origen's treatise &#145;On prayer&#146; (Trinity College Library, Cambridge), but he was suffering from a serious stomach illness and he cut his trip short, returning to London by the end of the year.<br>
<br>Thorndike's own major publication of the interregnum, <span class="italic">An Epilogue to the Tragedy of the Church of England</span>, used what he called &#145;the Present Calamity of the Church of England&#146; as the basis for discussing a wide range of theological issues: scripture and tradition, the Trinity, justification, predestination, the sacraments, and relations between church and state. His intention was evidently to lay a foundation not only for the restoration of the Church of England but also for the bringing together of the major Western churches. Reason was the means of resolving differences, but it was to be guided by the scriptures as understood by the &#145;whole Church, from the beginning&#146;  (bk 1, pp. 1&#150;3, 35). In the section entitled &#145;The covenant of grace&#146; he combined a doctrine of justification by grace through faith with a doctrine of the church as the body of the baptized who sought to be obedient to God's commands and were nurtured by the word and sacraments. The &#145;Epilogue&#146; expressed both a protestant soteriology and a largely Catholic ecclesiology. Thorndike regarded the Roman Catholic church as &#145;a true Church&#146; which &#145;continueth the same visible body, by the succession of Pastors and Lawes&#146; from the apostles' days, but considered that it was corrupt in many ways and had made unwarranted additions to the historic Christian faith. He saw a mean between the extremes of Roman Catholicism and the radical protestant sects as the surest way to salvation. The work was not universally well received by Anglican loyalists: Edward Hyde reacted sharply in May 1659 to news of the book's publication, expressing dismay that Thorndike had cast doubt on the English church's prospects for survival and had thus aided its enemies.<br>
<br>With the Restoration and the reinstatement of bishops in the established church, Thorndike received back posts he had lost fifteen years before, taking up residence as a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and regaining the rectory of Barley, although he resigned from the latter in 1662. He set out his plans for a reunited English church in <span class="italic">The Due Way of Composing the Differences on Foot Preserving the Church</span> (1660), where he argued that like the ancient church, it should be episcopally governed and its life centred on the celebration of the eucharist. He saw the reconstitution of the English church as an opportunity for Christians of all kinds, including protestant sectarians and recusant Roman Catholics, to form a single body which would reflect the greater unity that Christians sought. In practical terms, however, he was less eirenic, opposing, for example, the recognition of non-episcopal ordinations of the period of the civil wars and interregnum. Comprehension of the kind he had encouraged was not the result of the Savoy conference of 1661, of which he was a member, and he assisted in the preparation of the more narrowly drawn revised <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, imposed by the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of May 1662. A hardening attitude can be detected in his <span class="italic">Just Weights and Measures</span> (1662), which attempted to describe, using reason and the evidence of the practice of the church through the ages, the essential characteristics of the universal church. The sacraments of baptism and the eucharist were placed at the heart of the life of the church while the other traditional sacraments&#151;confirmation, ordination, marriage, penance, and unction&#151;were closely linked to the latter.<br>
<br>In 1663 Thorndike was nominated as a Cambridge DD by royal mandate, but he did not proceed to the degree. After resigning his fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1667, Thorndike retired to Westminster Abbey, where he had been a prebendary since 5 September 1661, and lived in a residence in the cloisters. From 1668 he was joined by his nieces Alice and Martha, daughters of his late brother, John, recently returned from America. He had not retired from ecclesiological controversy. In <span class="italic">A Due Discourse of the Forbearance, or, The Penalties which a Due Reformation Requires</span> (1670), he argued against a proposed comprehension of ministers who had been ordained by presbyters only, on the grounds that episcopal ordination was now available to them. He acknowledged that foreign reformed divines who had been ordained by presbyters only had been recognized by the English church, but he asserted that their ordinations had been carried out by necessity, since bishops had not been available. He was, however, sympathetic to the presbyterian stress on the need for greater spiritual discipline in English parishes, which for Thorndike would include the use of private confession, and he proposed a conference on this subject. The same year he published a work he had evidently worked on for some time, <span class="italic">De ratione ac jure finiendi controversias ecclesiae disputatio</span>, a restatement in Latin of his fundamental theological principles, reflecting his continuing interest in reconciliation among the churches. This was the first volume of a projected longer work, and was reissued in 1674 as <span class="italic">Origines ecclesiasticae, sive, De jure et potestate ecclesiae Christianae exercitationes</span>.<br>
<br>Thorndike died on 11 July 1672 in Chiswick, where he had moved to a facility maintained by Westminster Abbey for those in failing health. He was buried in the abbey on 13 July. In his will he left funds for the augmentation of Trinity College livings, especially the vicarage of Trumpington, and benefactions for his nieces Alice and Martha and his great-niece Alice Alington (granddaughter of his brother Francis). Thorndike left unpublished Latin writings to Peter Gunning, bishop of Chichester. Several works, unpublished in Thorndike's lifetime, were first printed in his <span class="italic">Works</span>, edited by Arthur W. Haddan, from manuscripts in the chapter library at Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Thorndike was a controversial writer in his time, as Edward Hyde's response to the &#145;Epilogue&#146; suggests. Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, in his <span class="italic">Brief Reply to a Late Answer</span> (1672) took issue with what he saw as Thorndike's too favourable view of the Roman Catholic mass. Meanwhile, George Whitehead, in <span class="italic">The Popish Informer Reprehended for his False Information Against the Quakers Meetings</span> (1670), had attacked Thorndike for his assertion that the Quakers' reliance on the guidance of the Holy Spirit was greater than their reliance on the scriptures. Edward Stillingfleet took the side of More against Thorndike on the question of the Roman Catholic church's alleged idolatry in the use of images, in <span class="italic">A Defence of the Discourse Concerning the Idolatry Practised in the Church of Rome</span> (1676). On the other hand, the Roman Catholic writer Thomas Godden cited Thorndike's views approvingly in his <span class="italic">Catholicks No Idolators</span> (1672). A few years later, in an effort to vindicate Thorndike from suspicion of popery, Stillingfleet published a manuscript by Thorndike, written &#145;a little before his death&#146;, which he included as part of <span class="italic">Several Conferences between a Romish Priest, a Fanatic Chaplain, and a Divine of the Church of England</span> (1679). Here the Church of England spokesman cited Thorndike's opinions on several doctrines of the Church of Rome, including transubstantiation, the papal deposing power, and the efficacy of indulgences, showing that he was soundly protestant. Nevertheless, Thorndike continued to be viewed in some quarters as pro-papal. Isaac Barrow, in <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Pope's Supremacy</span> (1680), found Thorndike's stress on the unity of the visible church as too close to the Roman Catholic claim that all churches should be under one government. Richard Baxter, in his treatise <span class="italic">Against the Revolt to a Foreign Jurisdiction</span> (1691), charged that Thorndike advocated a universal church with legislative powers, governed by general councils, in which the papacy would play a key part, both in the councils and in the regular life of the church.<br>
<br>In the nineteenth century Thorndike was rediscovered and his ideas championed by adherents of the Oxford Movement. In <span class="italic">Tracts for the Times</span> (6 vols. in 5, 1834&#150;41), J. H. Newman, J. Keble, W. Palmer, and others quoted excerpts from Thorndike's writings on baptism, on the authority of doctrine, and on the eucharist. J. S. Brewer edited a new edition of Thorndike's <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Right of the Church in a Christian State</span> in 1841, and John David Chambers edited passages from Thorndike's writings for his <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist</span> in 1855. Edward B. Pusey wrote to H. E. Manning on 12 August 1845 that it was Thorndike's writings that first caused him to question &#145;our hereditary maxim that a particular church had a right to reform itself&#146;, and had thus led him to a broader view of the church  (Nockles, 179). Of the greatest importance for this revival of interest in Thorndike was the edition of his <span class="italic">Theological Works</span> in the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology (1844&#150;56), with a detailed life of the theologian by Arthur W. Haddan. Haddan included several hitherto unpublished works as well as letters and papers relating to Thorndike.<br>
<br>Yet Thorndike's standing as a theologian has never been altogether secure. In the early twentieth century T. A. Lacey wrote that Thorndike, while learned, &#145;lacked the gift of a noble and lucid style which was shared by most of his compeers&#146;  (Lacey, 5). More recently it has been questioned why Thorndike was &#145;given such massive attention&#146; in the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology, &#145;when his contorted writings were regarded with deep suspicion by contemporaries&#146;  (Spurr, 395). The most recent full-length study, by Ernest Charles Miller, shows Thorndike, in his emphasis on reason, to be more closely connected to the latitudinarian tradition of rational theology in the seventeenth century than has been acknowledged. Miller sees Thorndike's ecclesiology as a creative integration of Anglican themes into a cohesive system that remained largely unappreciated before the Tractarians rediscovered his thought. From the evidence cited here, Thorndike emerges as an original, critical, and scholarly theologian and biblical commentator who began his career as a moderate Calvinist and ended it&#151;impelled by his experience of religious and political radicalism during the civil wars and interregnum&#151;as a forerunner of the Tractarians. His stress on the church's autonomy, on the importance of episcopacy, on the centrality of the sacraments, and on the eventual goal of a reunited, universal, visible church all mark him as an Anglican who anticipated many of the values and ideas expressed in his church in later centuries.<br>
