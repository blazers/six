<span class="headword">Delepierre,  Joseph Octave</span>  (1802&#150;1879), <span class="occ">author and antiquary</span>, was born at Bruges on 12 March 1802, the son of Joseph Delepierre, for many years receiver-general of West Flanders. His mother was a Penaranda, descended from a Spanish family long established in the Netherlands. By the age of twelve he had been taught neither to read nor to write, but when at last he was sent to school he made rapid progress and soon qualified for the University of Ghent. Having obtained the degree of doctor of laws, he became an <i>avocat</i>, and was appointed archivist of West Flanders in Bruges and at once set himself to bring the chaotic archive into better order.<br>
<br>Delepierre was a keen antiquary and his <span class="italic">Pr&eacute;cis des annales de Bruges</span> (1835) was the first of many volumes devoted to the antiquities of his native city. He also collected books and works of art. When the prince consort and his brother visited Bruges in 1839, Delepierre was their cicerone. In 1840 he compiled the first volume of a <span class="italic">Pr&eacute;cis analytique</span> of the contents of the archives under his care. From 1841 he also edited several volumes for the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&Eacute;mulation.<br>
<br>Denied promotion in the archive, Delepierre was persuaded by Van de Weyer, afterwards Belgian minister in Britain, to go to London in 1843; in August 1849 Van de Weyer appointed Delepierre a secretary of legation, and obtained for him the post of Belgian consul. During his first years in Britain official duties and an active participation in literary circles occupied him so completely that he published little until 1849, when he drew up an account of a collection of early French farces and moralities in the British Museum. In 1852 he produced <span class="italic">Macaron&eacute;ana</span>, followed in 1862 by <span class="italic">Macaron&eacute;ana Andra</span>, well-reviewed descriptions of macaronic writings.<br>
<br>When the duc d'Aumale, Van de Weyer, Lord Houghton, and others founded the Philobiblon in 1853 (then limited to thirty-six members), Delepierre was appointed one of the honorary secretaries. He contributed twenty-two papers to its <span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, many of which he later enlarged and republished separately. Delepierre was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and a member of many other British, Belgian, and French societies. He was decorated with several foreign orders of knighthood. For more than thirty-five years he acted as Belgian secretary of legation, and, until 1877, when he resigned, he was consul-general for Belgium in London. He was twice married, first to Emily, the sister of Sir Robert Cornelius Napier, the first Lord Napier of Magdala, and daughter of Major Charles Frederick Napier (<i>d</i>. 1812); they had two daughters. One of these died young; the other married Johannes Nicholas Tr&uuml;bner, who wrote a memoir of Delepierre in 1880. His second wife, who survived him, was the widow of Captain Jasper Trowce. Delepierre died on 18 August 1879 at the house of his son-in-law J. N. Tr&uuml;bner at 29 Upper Hamilton Terrace, London, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 22 August.<br>
<br>Delepierre was a prolific author, mainly on topics related to Belgium and particularly Bruges, and in many fields of antiquarian studies. His works were mainly in French and were published in Belgium. They extend to translations and editions of the works of others as well as his own writings. Tall and dignified, Delepierre was a good companion, who enjoyed conversation and chess. Although he became quite English in habits and speech, he never lost his attachment to his native land.<br>
