<span class="headword">Eassie,  William</span>  (1832&#150;1888), <span class="occ">sanitary engineer and pioneer of cremation</span>, was born at Lochee, near Dundee, on 8 September 1832, the first of two sons of William Eassie (1805&#150;1861), a carpenter and wheelwright, and his wife, Jean Boyd, whom he married in 1831. William Eassie senior worked on the East Lancashire Railway as an engineering contractor, before settling in Gloucester, where between 1845 and 1849 he established a timber yard on the banks of the Gloucester Canal; here the business supplied the Gloucester and Forest of Dean Railway and other projects.<br>
<br>No definite information can be traced about William Eassie's early schooling in Dundee, though his later interests indicate that he had received a classical education. He trained as an engineer under Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and was described as a &#145;favourite assistant&#146; to the great engineer  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 Sept 1888). He was involved in railway construction in south Wales before going to the Crimea in May 1855 to supervise the erection of wooden huts (then described as &#145;pavilions&#146;), which had been prefabricated at his father's Gloucester timber works to a design by Brunel, for the military hospital at Renkioi, on the Dardanelles. At Renkioi, where he was assistant engineer, he met Edmund Parkes, an authority on military hygiene, and the surgeon Thomas Spencer Wells. While in the Crimea, Parkes, Spencer Wells, and Eassie went on archaeological digs; Eassie and another engineer, John Brunton, excavated at the site of ancient Troy. Eassie later recorded his observations of the Near East in <span class="italic">Romaic Beauties and Trojan Humbugs</span> (1858), written under the pseudonym Rattlebrain. He was subsequently elected a fellow of the Linnean Society on 7 April 1864 (he was proposed by Joseph Paxton) and was also a fellow of the Geological Society.<br>
<br>After returning from the Crimea in 1856 Eassie continued as an engineering contractor, constructing the military camp at the Curragh of Kildare, and carrying out mining surveys in Germany, Poland, and elsewhere. He married, in 1858 at Gloucester, Rose Anna Hanlon, the daughter of a Kildare doctor. They had seven sons and two daughters; the fourth son became Brigadier-General Fitzpatrick Eassie (1864&#150;1943), an army veterinarian. Following the death of their father in 1861, William and his younger brother ran the Gloucester timber business until the latter's death in 1875, when it was sold. By 1871 Eassie had moved to Child's Hill, Hendon, with London offices at 1 Great Winchester Street Buildings, then 11 Argyle Street, where he practised as a consulting sanitary engineer. In 1872 he published <span class="italic">Healthy Houses</span>, which reflected the growing importance attached to good plumbing and drainage in domestic dwellings. He also edited the dairy engineering pages of the <span class="italic">Milk Journal</span>. He was a regular correspondent on sanitary questions; he advocated, for example, that there should be an agreed definition of what constituted domestic waste, which local authorities were required to collect from householders' dustbins under the terms of public health legislation  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 May 1885). With Ernest Hart he founded and was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Sanitary Journal</span> and he was largely responsible for the establishment of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain.<br>
<br>Eassie was an early member of the Cremation Society of England, of which he was appointed honorary secretary on 29 July 1874, with an honorarium of &pound;25 a year. The society had been founded earlier in 1874, following the publication in the <span class="italic">Contemporary Review</span> in January 1874 of &#145;The treatment of the body after death&#146; by the surgeon Sir Henry Thompson, who responded to critics in a further article in March 1874. This prompted a group of supporters to form a society to promote cremation: Spencer Wells, Ernest Hart, Charles Voysey, and Hugh Haweis were among the founder members. Eassie himself had written &#145;Cremation&#146; in January 1874 in the <span class="italic">London Medical Record</span>, but his contribution was eclipsed by that of Thompson, whose standing in the medical profession commanded greater attention.<br>
<br>The discovery of ashes in burial sites during his excavations on the Trojan plains nearly two decades earlier seems to have originally prompted Eassie to consider the benefits of cremation. His pioneering work <span class="italic">Cremation of the Dead: its History and Bearing upon Public Health</span> (1875) discussed the various methods for disposing of the dead in different cultures and historical periods. He carefully refuted the idea that cremation was prohibited by the scriptures. His principal concern was to demonstrate that cremation was a more sanitary practice than burial, whose drawbacks included pollution of the air, soil, and water supplies, as well as encroachments upon space in urban areas. His book discussed the law, the problems of earth burial, the promotion of cremation on the mainland of Europe (he had witnessed the cremation in Germany in 1874 of Lady Dilke, first wife of Sir Charles Dilke), and finally the technicalities of cremation. In the last chapter he provided a comprehensive review of cremating apparatus and particularly recommended the furnaces invented by William Siemens.<br>
<br>Eassie was an effective and diligent secretary for the Cremation Society. He negotiated with the London Necropolis Company concerning the purchase of one acre of land at Woking for a crematorium, supervising the construction of the cremator in 1879. The first legal cremation in Britain, of Jeannette Pickersgill, took place at Woking in March 1885. As engineer to the society, Eassie was present during many of the early cremations. He edited the early editions of the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Cremation Society of England</span> and also lectured on the subject. In June 1886 he represented the society at the Cremation Congress in Dresden. He died on 16 August 1888 at his home, 73 King Henry's Road, Hampstead, and was buried in the family grave at St Mary's Roman Catholic cemetery at Kensal Green on 20 August. There is no memorial on the grave but a tablet on the wall of the gallery in the chapel at Woking commemorates his contribution to the work of the Cremation Society.<br>
