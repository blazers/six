<span class="headword">Rainy,  Robert</span>  (1826&#150;1906), <span class="occ">United Free Church of Scotland minister</span>, elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23035/', "Harry Rainy MD (1792&#150;1876)")</script>, professor of forensic medicine in Glasgow University, and his wife, Barbara Gordon (<i>d</i>. July 1854), was born at 49 Montrose Street, Glasgow, on 1 January 1826. On 10 October 1835 he entered Glasgow high school, where Alexander Maclaren was his schoolfellow. In October 1838 he proceeded to Glasgow University, where he graduated MA in April 1844. He had been taken by his father's friend Robert Buchanan (1802&#150;1875) to the debates in the general assembly of 1841 leading to the Disruption; when the Disruption came in 1843 he felt a vocation to the ministry of the Free Church. However, his father intended him for the medical profession, and on his father's advice he gave a year (1843&#150;4) to medical study. In 1844 he entered the Divinity Hall of the Free Church (New College, Edinburgh), studying under Thomas Chalmers, David Welsh, William Cunningham, &#145;rabbi&#146; John Duncan, and Alexander Campbell Fraser. He was at this time a member of the famous Speculative Society of Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>Rainy was licensed on 7 November 1849 by the Free Church presbytery of Glasgow, and for six months had charge of a mission at Inchinnan, near Renfrew. By Elizabeth, dowager duchess of Gordon, he was made chaplain at Huntly Lodge; declining other calls, he became minister of Huntly Free Church, ordained there by Strathbogie presbytery on 12 January 1851. His reputation was such that in 1854 he was called to Free High Church, Edinburgh, in succession to Robert Gordon. As he wished to remain in Huntly his presbytery declined (12 April 1854) to sustain the call, as did the synod; the general assembly (22 May 1854) transferred him to Edinburgh, henceforth his home. After moving to Edinburgh Rainy married one of his parishioners, Susan (<i>b</i>. 1835), daughter of Adam Rolland of Gask, on 2 December 1857. Their first son lived only briefly; they subsequently had three sons and three daughters. Susan Rainy was active in the Free Church and was convenor of the Women's Temporary Committee in 1903. She died on 30 September 1905. Rainy's pastorate lasted until 1862, when he was made professor of church history in New College, Edinburgh, delivering his inaugural lecture on 7 November 1862. In 1863 he received the degree of DD from Glasgow University. He became principal of the college in 1874, and retained this post until his death, resigning his chair in 1901.<br>
<br>Rainy's position soon became that of the ecclesiastical statesman of his church, of whose assembly he was moderator in 1887, 1900, and 1905. His aim appears to have been to permit gradual &#145;modernization&#146; of Free Church theology on questions such as biblical criticism, evolution, and the Westminster confession, while simultaneously pursuing disestablishment of the Church of Scotland. During the prosecution of William Robertson Smith (1876&#150;1881), he sought a diplomatic solution, and was successful in preventing the condemnation of Smith's teaching; the price for this was a formal condemnation of Smith on Rainy's motion on 23 May 1881, and Smith's consequent loss of his chair. In 1890 Rainy's diplomatic skills played an important part in the avoidance of prosecution of Marcus Dods and Alexander Balmain Bruce. Rainy gave no clear intellectual lead in these controversies. It has been said of him &#145;that he had practised the art of concealing his thoughts for so long that he had lost the ability to express them frankly and briefly&#146;  (Drummond and Bulloch, 8). His publications were mostly collected lectures and sermons. He also published <span class="italic">Presbyterianism as a Form of Church Life and Work</span> (1894) and <span class="italic">The Ancient Catholic Church</span> (1902). He edited <span class="italic">The Presbyterian</span> (1868&#150;71) and contributed to collections of essays, including W. Wilson's <span class="italic">Memorials of R. S. Candlish</span> (1880) and F. Hastings's <span class="italic">The Atonement</span> (1883). Rainy pursued disestablishment with energy and resource, and succeeded in bringing pressure to bear on the Liberal Party leadership whose willingness to give the matter priority was vital. But Welsh rather than Scottish disestablishment took priority in the 1892&#150;5 Liberal government.<br>
<br>Rainy also pursued the objective of a union of the various free churches. In 1876, after prolonged negotiations, he achieved the union of the Reformed Presbyterian synod with the Free Church (the Original Succession synod having been incorporated with the Free Church in 1852). In 1881 he became convenor of his church's Highland committee. His lack of Gaelic disadvantaged him, but between 1882 and 1893 he raised &pound;10,795 for endowment and more than &pound;10,000 for church building, mainly in the Outer Hebrides. Despite this, &#145;Black Rainy&#146; was not much trusted in Gaelic-speaking areas. The <span class="roman">Declaratory Act</span> of 1892, largely passed as a result of his efforts, allowed for a more flexible interpretation of the Westminster confession and further encouraged the Free Church away from rigid Calvinism. Union with the United Presbyterian church was effected on 31 October 1900, with Rainy as the first moderator of the United Free Church. Discontented members of the old Free Church, mostly in Gaelic-speaking areas, won an action claiming for the dissentient minority the ownership of the pre-1900 Free Church property. Rainy co-ordinated the consequent negotiations and presentation of evidence to the royal commission chaired by Lord Elgin, which recommended that the Lords' verdict be reversed by statute; this was achieved by the <span class="roman">Scottish Churches Bill</span> (1905). Rainy achieved a fairly satisfactory amendment of the bill in the Commons in favour of the United Free Church. In good health hitherto, Rainy was operated on for an internal disorder and went on a recuperative voyage to Australia in October 1906. He reached Melbourne on 8 December 1906 and died there of lymphadenoma on 22 December. He was buried in the Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, on 7 March 1907.<br>
<br>Rainy's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_35653"></a><span class="headword">Adam Rolland Rainy</span>  (1862&#150;1911), MA, MB, and CM (Edinburgh), studied at Berlin and Vienna, and practised from 1887 to 1900 as a <span class="occ">surgeon oculist</span> in London. He travelled in Australia and New Zealand (1891), in the West Indies (1896), and in Spain and Algiers (1899 and 1903). Entering on political work he contested Kilmarnock burghs in 1900 as a radical, gained the seat in 1906, and held it until his sudden death at North Berwick on 26 August 1911. He married in 1887 Annabella, second daughter of Hugh Matheson of Ross-shire; she survived him with a son and two daughters.<br>
