<span class="headword">Coke,  George</span>  (1570&#150;1646), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was born on 3 October 1570, the fifth son of Richard Coke (<i>d</i>. 1582) of Trusley, Derbyshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1580), daughter of Thomas Sacheverell of Kirby, Nottinghamshire. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1588, graduating BA in 1593 and proceeding MA in 1596. He was made a fellow of Pembroke College in 1597, rhetoric lecturer in 1602, and was junior taxor of the university in the year 1605/6. In 1608 he was presented to the rectory of Bygrave in Hertfordshire, worth nearly &pound;300 p.a., where, Fuller quaintly observed, &#145;a lean village (consisting of but three houses) maketh a fat living&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 115). About the end of 1609 he resigned his fellowship and between 18 November that year and 9 January 1610 he married Jane Heigham. He moved to Bygrave, where he remained for the next twenty-three years. Fuller called him &#145;a meek, grave and quiet man&#146;  (ibid.). Only after <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5828/', "Sir John Coke (1563&#150;1644)")</script>, one of his older brothers, was advanced to be secretary of state in autumn 1625 was this essentially mediocre yet personable cleric plucked from the obscurity of his country living and preferred beyond his abilities, a minnow in a world of sharks.<br>
<br>On 19 January 1626 Coke was collated to the prebend of Finsbury in St Paul's Cathedral, and, having received a DD degree in 1630, on 10 February 1633 he was consecrated bishop of Bristol. In June 1635 he was instituted as rector of Maiden Newton, Dorset, despite the opposition of Sir John Strangeways who believed that the advowson was his. Coke was translated to Hereford in July 1636, apparently, as in his elevation to Bristol, with the support of William Laud. At the same time he resigned both Bygrave and his prebend at St Paul's.<br>
<br>Coke had an unhappy time at Hereford, which he described in February 1640 as &#145;this place of tryal, under so much variety of business and among such men, as are &hellip; too strong and cunning for me&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 69868, fol. 142<i>r</i>); two years earlier he had said that of all the justices in Herefordshire, no more than four were his defenders in a county where local juries were habitually against the church and the bishop. By the end of 1637, to add to his troubles, his eyesight was failing and in dim light he was forced to wear spectacles. In October 1638 he was censured by Archbishop Laud for presenting one who was insufficiently learned to cathedral office: one of Coke's sons had deserted his apprenticeship and run away to sea but, seeing in the storms that beset his vessel a providential sign, had turned back and sought ordination, and his father had made him precentor of Hereford Cathedral. On Laud's protest Coke replaced his son with his nephew Francis Coke (<i>d</i>. 1682), son of his eldest brother Sir Francis Coke, but he was soon complaining that Francis was unthankful and unfriendly to him.<br>
<br>In December 1641 Coke was one of the twelve bishops who petitioned parliament, for which he was impeached and imprisoned for seventeen weeks. Retiring to his see, he was in Hereford in April 1643 when it fell to the parliament but, under the articles of surrender of the town, escaped molestation. However, when Hereford fell for the second time, in December 1645, he was captured and taken to Gloucester, and on 3 January 1646 the Commons ordered that he and the other prisoners be sent to London. His estate at Queest Moor in the parish of Eardisley in Herefordshire was sequestered on 13 August 1646 and, although thrifty, he was reduced to living on the charity of his relations. He died on 10 December 1646 at Queest Moor and was buried in Eardisley church five days later. After the Restoration an elaborate monument, with recumbent effigy, was erected in Hereford Cathedral; it was much altered in the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
