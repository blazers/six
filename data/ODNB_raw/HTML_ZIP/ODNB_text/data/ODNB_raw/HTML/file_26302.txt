<span class="headword">Stapleton, Sir  Miles, of Bedale</span>  (1320?&#150;1364), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the elder son of Sir Gilbert Stapleton (1290&#150;1321) and Matilda 
    (or Agnes; 1297/8&#150;1348)
  , elder daughter and coheir of Brian Fitzalan, lord of Bedale, Askham Brian, and Cotherstone. His paternal grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26301/', "Miles Stapleton, first Lord Stapleton (d. 1314)")</script>, who was steward of the household under Edward II.<br>
<br>It is sometimes impossible to distinguish Sir Miles Stapleton of Bedale from his first cousin, Sir Miles Stapleton of Haddlesey (<i>c</i>.1318&#150;1372). Often identified as <i>le seigneur</i>, Haddlesey was betrothed to Isabella Vavasour in 1338, but they never married. In 1343 he obtained livery of his inheritance, the manors of Carleton, Southburn, Tibthorpe, and Kentmore. At the battle of Cr&eacute;cy he was in the retinue of Sir John Darcy, and in September 1350 he went on pilgrimage abroad. He was escheator and sheriff of Yorkshire from November 1352 to December 1353, and from November 1354 to March 1356. He was linked to the earl of Lancaster in October 1354. In 1356 he was paid 200 marks for escorting David II, king of Scots from Newcastle to London, and in 1358 he was summoned to parliament, but never attended. He sat on various commissions in Yorkshire between 1352 and 1366. He died on 27 December 1372, leaving one son (<i>b</i>. 1349) and one daughter (<i>b</i>. 1350). His will is dated 24 August 1372.<br>
<br>Miles Stapleton of Bedale (sometimes known as Cotherstone) was an infant only child on his father's death in 1321. It was probably he who went overseas in the king's service in September 1342, and the family's historian suggests that he was at the siege of Tournai with his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26299/', "Brian Stapleton")</script>, and then in Brittany. A Miles Stapleton, probably of Bedale, was singled out by the chronicler Adam Murimuth as taking the honours on the first day of a three-day tournament at Windsor which in January 1344 saw the inauguration of the order of the knights of the Round Table. He was given letters of protection to go abroad with Sir John Darcy, the king's chamberlain, in 1345, which may suggest that he was educated in Darcy's household. He was certainly present at the siege of Calais in 1346, and given his later link with the Garter, he almost certainly fought at Cr&eacute;cy in 1346 too. Having become associated with the royal household at about this time, he took part in three further tournaments between October 1347 and January 1348, at Bury St Edmunds, Eltham, and Windsor. An account for the great wardrobe in 1348 describes him as a knight of the chamber, and he became a founder member of the Order of the Garter, sitting on the king's side in the ninth stall [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92770', "Founding knights of the Order of the Garter")</script>].<br>
<br>In October 1351 Stapleton was sent abroad with William Latimer and then, for a while, the careers of both Miles Stapletons, of Bedale and of Haddlesey, sometimes coincided. In 1354 both witnessed an instrument requesting papal intervention in the Anglo-French war. Stapleton of Bedale was involved in Lancaster's march across Normandy in 1356, and in 1358 he was paid &pound;50 for acting as a messenger to Philippe de Navarre. In 1359 he went abroad again on royal service. In June 1360 he was granted a life annuity of &pound;100, in consideration of his &#145;laudable service in the king's deeds of war&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1358&#150;61</i>, 429). This makes it likely that he is the Miles Stapleton who was one of the witnesses to the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny in 1360. Abroad again in June 1361 and January 1362, on the latter occasion he made his brother Brian his attorney for two years. His destination in 1362 appears to have been the Baltic rather than France, since in January 1363 he was one of a group of leading English knights recorded as borrowing money from local merchants at Thorn on the Vistula. The money was to be repaid at Bruges. In March 1361 and August 1362 he served on commissions of peace with the earl of Suffolk. Miles Stapleton of Haddlesey was appointed to a commission of the peace headed by the earl of Lancaster in 1361.<br>
<br>In January 1364 Miles Stapleton of Bedale took out letters of attorney for three more years, but died on 20 October 1364, probably from wounds or disease after the battle of Auray (29 September 1364). Escheators in Yorkshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Berkshire, and Wiltshire were ordered to take his lands into their custody on 12 February 1365, a delay of three and a half months, suggesting he died abroad, probably in France. Queen Philippa was granted his lands on 21 February 1365 during the minority of his heir, but this wardship was sold to Brian Stapleton for &pound;1000 in May 1365.<br>
<br>Miles Stapleton of Bedale is described by the chronicler Geoffrey Baker as a man of great integrity and deep devotion to the Virgin. He married twice. With his first wife Isolda (surname unknown) he had a son, John, who died in childhood. In 1350, Isolda having died, he married again; his second wife was Joan, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14392/', "Sir Oliver Ingham")</script> and widow of Roger Lestrange, with whom she had a son, Roger, and from whom she had dower in Shropshire and Oxfordshire. With Stapleton she had three children: Miles (<i>b</i>. 1356), who married the niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27977/', "Robert Ufford, first earl of Suffolk")</script>; Joan (<i>d</i>. 1385), who married Sir John Plays; and Hugh, who married Matilda, widow of Hugh Fastolf. In May 1349 Stapleton was licensed to endow a chantry at North Morton, but following his second marriage his plans became more ambitious, and between 1355 and 1360 his chantry developed into a Trinitarian priory at Ingham, to which Ingham parish church was appropriated. Stapleton was buried in the church, and he and his descendants were commemorated there in a series of splendid brasses: Sir Miles and his second wife were shown holding hands, with the inscription &#145;Priez pour les almes monseur Miles de Stapleton et Dame Johanne sa femme fille de Monseur Oliver de Ingham fondeurs de cette maison qe dieu de lour almes eit pitee&#146; (&#145;Pray for the souls of Sir Miles Stapleton and Lady Joan his wife, daughter of Sir Oliver Ingham, founders of this house, that God may have pity on their souls&#146;; Gough, 1/2,120). In 1799 the brasses were sold as &#145;old metal&#146;, but rubbings were taken of them before their destruction.<br>
