<span class="headword">Bonvisi,  Antonio <span class="st"> [Anthony]</span></span>  (1470<span class="mult">x</span>75&#150;1558), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born in England between 1470 and 1475, possibly the son of Louis Bonvisi. He belonged to an ancient family from Lucca, north Italy, which was descended from a councillor of the emperor Otto III in the tenth century, and had become merchants and bankers. He established himself in the family business, which he further extended by introducing a new method of spinning into the Devonshire cloth trade. By 1513 he was already a thriving merchant, and laying the foundation of the great wealth for which he was famous. In that year he received from Henry VIII a remission of customs for five years in repayment of a loan to the crown. He dealt largely in fine woollen cloth, and also imported jewels and other foreign articles, for which Cardinal Wolsey was one of his principal customers. He acted as banker for the government, transmitting money and letters to ambassadors in France, Italy, and elsewhere. Henry VIII personally contacted Cardinal Campeggi in Rome, requesting his favour towards Bonvisi in a lawsuit (1526). He was proctor-general for Silvestro Gigli, the absentee bishop of Worcester and the government's personal agent at the papal court. Sometimes through his correspondents he succeeded in obtaining earlier news of foreign events than the government did. In March 1528 Stephen Vaughan, agent to Thomas Cromwell, sent the latter news of the French invasion of Naples, which he had learned from Bonvisi.<br>
<br>Bonvisi was a patron and friend of a number of learned men. Thomas Starkey, Thomas Winter, Florence Volusenus, and others expressed their obligations to him, and he knew Sir Thomas More especially well. From the late 1490s, he regularly entertained More in his house. Their conversations probably had an influence on the content of More's <span class="italic">Utopia</span> (1516), which delighted Bonvisi. In 1524 he helped clarify More's thoughts on heresy and the papal primacy. He was godfather to one of More's grandsons, and in 1524 he purchased from More the lease of Crosby Place in Bishopsgate Street, London. When More was sent to the Tower in 1534, Bonvisi supplied him with meat and wine and provided a silk camlet gown for him to wear to his execution. In one of his last letters from the Tower, written with a coal, More speaks of himself as having been for nearly forty years &#145;not a guest, but a continual nurseling&#146; in Bonvisi's house, and calls him &#145;the apple of mine eye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, letter 217). Bonvisi's friendship was also extended to Fisher, bishop of Rochester, imprisoned with More in the Tower, to whom he sent each day a quart of French wine, stewed meat, and jellies. His attitude to Henry VIII's divorce is demonstrated by the courageous help he gave to Friar Peto, who had fled to the Low Countries after preaching a violent sermon against the king.<br>
<br>Bonvisi spent late 1535 and most of 1536 in Lyons, in Lucca, and in other parts of north Italy. From Europe he wrote a series of letters to Thomas Cromwell which formed the government's main source of news about troop movements, the political situation, and rumours concerning the French and imperialists, battling for control of Italy. The last years of Henry VIII's reign show Bonvisi still in a position to command respect. In 1544 he was twice given a licence to trade with France, despite a general prohibition. But his well-known aversion to the principles of the Reformation (Wriothesley called him &#145;a rank papist&#146;) gave him a sense of insecurity in England as the Reformation advanced under Edward VI. The introduction of the first <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> (1549) hastened his choice between conformity or exile. On 22 June 1547 he had obtained a licence to convey Crosby Place to Richard Heywood, in trust for himself, and about the same time he procured a quittance for all sums of money paid to him by the crown since 1544. Having thus settled his affairs, he fled to Louvain on 25 September 1549. His house was seized by the sheriffs of London on 7 February 1550.<br>
<br>Bonvisi's house in Louvain became a refuge for religious exiles, especially More's relations and friends. That his leadership of the exiled Catholics there was recognized by the English government is shown by his exclusion, together with others of his household at Louvain, from the general pardon of 1553. Although Mary's accession enabled him to regain his English property (10 May 1554), he was probably too old to contemplate returning. But the esteem in which he was held by the Marian regime is shown in an address by Cardinal Pole to an assembly of Londoners after the formal reconciliation with Rome (November 1554). He called Bonvisi &#145;a special benefactor to all Catholic and good persons &hellip; I doubt not but his name is in the Book of Life&#146;  (quoted in Ford, 235). Bonvisi died in Louvain on 7 December 1558, and was buried there, leaving Benedict Bonvisi, the son of his brother Martin, to inherit his English property.<br>
