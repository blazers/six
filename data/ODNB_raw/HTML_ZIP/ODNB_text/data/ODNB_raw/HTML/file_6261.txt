<span class="headword">Coprario,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1626), <span class="occ">composer and musician</span>, was, despite his name, evidently of English descent. Nothing is known for certain of his early life. Possibly he was the John Cowper who was installed as a chorister at Chichester Cathedral in 1575  (Dart). Anthony Wood's &#145;Notes on the lives of musicians&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., Wood, D.19[4]) describes Coprario as &#145;an English man borne, who having spent much of his time in Italy was there called Coprario, which name he kept when he returned into England&#146; (no specific evidence in confirmation of Wood's assertion is known, however). He was described by the late seventeenth-century writer Roger North as &#145;Coperario, who by the way was plain Cooper but affected an Itallian termination&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1602 William Petre paid Coprario 10<i>s</i>. for &#145;lessons hee brought mee&#146;. Sir Robert Cecil paid Coprario &pound;3 in connection with travel to the Low Countries in April 1603, and following his elevation to an earldom in 1605 (and subsequently to the position of lord treasurer) he became Coprario's regular patron. Cecil's musicians performed before Queen Anne on 31 October 1605, for which Coprario was paid &pound;5. During the next few years frequent payments were made by the earl of Salisbury to Coprario for a range of musical tasks, including the teaching of a boy, George Mason, repair and maintenance of stringed instruments, and &#145;setting of musick&#146;; there were several one-off payments (of &pound;20 in 1610, and &pound;10 in 1613) and fees were paid for hired musicians at entertainments  (Charteris, &#145;Jacobean Musicians&#146;). In 1613 Coprario attended Elector Frederick and Princess Caroline on their journey to Heidelberg, following their marriage (he had composed some music for Thomas Campion's <span class="italic">The Lord's Masque</span>, performed on 14 February that year, for which he was paid &pound;20). Later patrons of Coprario were Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, and Francis Clifford, earl of Cumberland. Thomas Fuller's <span class="italic">The History of the Worthies of England</span> (1662) claims that the composer William Lawes received his musical instruction under Coprario while the latter was in the employ of the earl of Hertford. The earl of Cumberland paid Coprario &pound;11 in January 1617 following his return from Dubrovnik, for which records show that he was granted a permission &#145;to goe unto forraigne partes for one yeare about dispatch of his private occasions&#146;; later that same year, Coprario was granted another pass enabling him to undertake a year-long journey to Germany  (Hulse).<br>
<br>Chief among Coprario's patrons, however, was Charles, prince of Wales (later Charles I). According to Sir John Hawkins's <span class="italic">A General History of the Science and Practice of Music</span> (1776) he was the music teacher of the children of James I; Charles Burney's <span class="italic">A General History of Music</span> (1776) specifies that he taught the future Charles I to play the viol. This much is speculative, though in 1618 Coprario received of Charles the sum of &pound;50, evidently in recognition of musical services rendered, and on 25 March 1622 there began a series of annual stipendiary payments to Coprario as one of the &#145;musicians-in-ordinary&#146; to the prince of Wales. In the same year, a small group known as &#145;Coprario's music&#146; was established within Charles's household, probably for the express purpose of performing Coprario's consort fantasias. When he became king in 1625, Charles made Coprario his composer-in-ordinary, but this appointment, the climax of his career, was short-lived. He was replaced by Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger in July 1626 &#145;in the place of John Copreario deceased&#146;  (Charteris, <span class="italic">John Coprario</span>): his death, in London, must have occurred about June of that year.<br>
<br>Coprario's output for string consort consists in the main of fantasias, a genre of composition akin to the fugue or canon (in which the separate strands of the polyphony imitate each other) which Thomas Morley, writing in his <span class="italic">Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music</span> (1597), had termed &#145;the chiefest kind of musicke which is made without a dittie&#146;. Coprario left examples in two, three, four, five, and six parts. If these works are traditional in idiom, his &#145;fantasia-suites&#146; break new ground. Here, the fantasia is followed by several dance pieces (to which it is connected in mode). Moreover, these works include prominent parts for the violin (rather than the older viol) and organ, tending at times towards a texture not dissimilar to that associated with the continuo bass, which had recently emerged in Italy, but elsewhere granting the keyboard part an essential, rather than merely subsidiary, accompanimental function. There are also works for the lyra viol (a special kind of consort bass viol, capable of playing melody and chordal accompaniment textures simultaneously). Anthony Wood (Bodl. Oxf., Wood, D.19[4] no. 106) later described Coprario as &#145;one of the first authors that set lessons to the viol lyra-way, and composed lessons not only to play alone, but for two or three lyra-viols in consert, which hath been approved by many excellent masters&#146;.<br>
<br>While Coprario will always be best-known as a composer of instrumental consort music, he also produced many secular vocal pieces. He was clearly familiar with a good deal of published Italian madrigal repertory from the end of the sixteenth century (including works by Marenzio, Anerio, Vecchi, and others), for he appropriated a large number of titles from such works in his forty-nine five-part instrumental settings for viol consort known today as &#145;instrumental madrigals&#146;; some of these pieces are actually based on the madrigals from which the titles are borrowed. Eight other similar works survive (for six viols), in three of which text is underlaid throughout, suggesting that they may have originated as vocal rather than instrumental pieces. There survive twenty-one genuinely vocal three-part villanellas, settings of Italian texts extracted in the main from Gorzani's <span class="italic">Primo libro di napolitane</span> (1570); three madrigals of rather more elevated pretensions (including one to a text by Petrarch); a lute song, &#145;Send home my long strayd eyes to mee&#146; (words by Donne); and three songs contributed to Thomas Campion's <span class="italic">Masque of Squires</span> (&#145;The Earle of Somerset's Masque&#146;), presented in December 1613. Coprario's <span class="italic">Funeral Teares</span> (1606) was written in memory of Charles Blount, earl of Devonshire, and contains seven settings of melancholic verse, possibly of Coprario's own composition, for solo voice or duet with the accompaniment of lute and bass viol. He could also capture the elegiac mood, as shown by the items written for Campion's <span class="italic">Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry</span> (1613). More devotional in intent are the settings &#145;Ile lie me downe&#146; and &#145;O Lord how doe my woes encrease&#146; included in Sir William Leighton's <span class="italic">Teares or Lamentations of a Sorrowful Soule</span> (1614).<br>
<br>Coprario wrote a short musical treatise, &#145;Rules how to compose&#146;, possibly about 1617. It was compiled to instruct the young William Lawes, whom the earl of Hertford had taken &#145;from his Father, and bred him of his own cost &hellip; under his Master Giovanni Coperario&#146;  (Ashbee and Lasocki). This was never published (the holograph survives in the Huntington Library, San Marino, California), but was evidently quite widely circulated in copies; it was clearly still influential in the 1650s and 1660s, when Christopher Simpson based some examples in his <span class="italic">The Principles of Practical Musick</span> (1665) on Coprario's. There is a strong similarity between Coprario's &#145;Rules&#146; and Campion's <span class="italic">A New Way of Making Fowre Parts in Counter-Point</span> (1613&#150;14), though which had the priority is unclear.<br>
