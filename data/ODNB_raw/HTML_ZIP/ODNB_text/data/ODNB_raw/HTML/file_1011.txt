<span class="headword">Baconthorpe <span class="st"> [Baco]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1290&#150;1345<span class="mult">x</span>52), <span class="occ">Carmelite friar and theologian</span>, was born at Baconsthorpe, near South Erpingham in Norfolk. According to his younger contemporary John Trisse, Baconthorpe was &#145;tiny&#146; (<i>minimus</i>), though &#145;very great in his wisdom and learning&#146;  (Xiberta, 206). Probably at a young age, he entered the Carmelite convent at Blakeney. He studied at Oxford, where he was taught by Robert Walsingham, regent master in 1312. Unlike most Carmelites of the English province, however, he went on to complete his studies in Paris, where he was taught by Guido Terreni. He lectured on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> and the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, probably before 1318, but was still a bachelor in 1321, if (as seems likely) he is &#145;John the English Carmelite&#146; who was present at Jean de Ponilly's ceremonial renunciation of his errors. He incepted very probably in 1323, and his regency may well have been prolonged beyond the required two years. In 1330, when he conducted his third quodlibetal disputation, he seems still to have been in Paris. He then returned to England and may have taught (as John Hornby, writing in 1374, testifies) at Cambridge, where there was a Carmelite house. In distinction 1, question 4 of his later &#145;canonical&#146; questions on book 4 of the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, Baconthorpe discusses Bradwardine's views on predestination in a way that suggests that he had disputed with him on the subject. Historians have seen this as evidence that Baconthorpe returned to teach at Oxford in the 1340s. But Bradwardine left Oxford in 1335. Perhaps Baconthorpe disputed with him there before then (Bradwardine had already begun to develop his own distinctive position); or perhaps later elsewhere. In addition to his teaching and writing, Baconthorpe was provincial of the English province, from 1326 or 1327 until 1333 at the earliest, but probably until 1336. He certainly died before 1352 and very probably after 1345.<br>
<br>As in the case of many fourteenth-century theologians, Baconthorpe's most important work is his <span class="italic">Quaestiones in quatuor libros sententiarum</span>, a commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>, an <i>ordinatio</i> (written up and revised version) of his lectures as a bachelor on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span>. A note in BL, Harley MS 1819, states that Baconthorpe completed book 1 of the commentary in March 1325. For books 1&#150;3 there are two recensions: an earlier one, found in the one surviving manuscript, BL, Royal MS 11 C.vi, and a later one, found in all the editions (Paris, 1484; Milan, 1510; Venice, 1526; Cremona, 1618). Baconthorpe rewrote his questions on book 4, calling his earlier set the &#145;speculative questions&#146;; the later set, the &#145;canonical questions&#146;, were written after 1336, since they use material from his commentary on <span class="roman">St Matthew</span>. Only some of the speculative questions survive, interspersed among the canonical questions in BL, Royal MS 9 C.vii (some of the former have been edited by Borchert, 1974). The other manuscripts (BL, Royal MS 11 B.xii; Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine, MS 900; Vienna, &Ouml;sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, MS 1530) and the editions (Milan, Venice, and Cremona; the Paris edition has just books 1&#150;3) have only the canonical questions. Three sets of quodlibetal questions by Baconthorpe are known (no surviving manuscript; editions: Venice, 1527; Cremona, 1618). According to the colophon in the first edition, the third of them was discussed by him &#145;in the school of the Carmelites at Paris in 1330&#146;. The other two are probably earlier, since Baconthorpe refers to them, but not to the third set, in his <span class="italic">Sentences</span> commentary.<br>
<br>Part of Baconthorpe's work as a master of theology was to comment on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. A commentary on <span class="roman">St Matthew</span> by him is preserved in Cambridge, Trinity College, MS 348 (after January 1336). A now lost manuscript contained his commentaries on the Pauline epistles, and commentaries on many other books of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> were attributed to him by John Bale. It has also been suggested that Baconthorpe wrote a commentary on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Metaphysics</span>; a commentary by him on the <span class="italic">De anima</span> is mentioned by Osbert Pickenham, a fellow English Carmelite, and by Richard Lavenham, and there is evidence that he commented on the <span class="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</span>. More unusually, Baconthorpe also commented on two works of Augustine, the <span class="italic">De trinitate</span> and the <span class="italic">De civitate Dei</span>, and on Anselm's <span class="italic">De incarnatione Verbi</span> and <span class="italic">Cur Deus homo</span> (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS 9540). He also wrote three short works on specifically Carmelite matters: a <span class="italic">Compendium historiarum et jurium pro defensione institutionis et confirmationis ordinis B. Mariae de Monte Carmeli</span>, a <span class="italic">Speculum de institutione ordinis ad venerationem virginis deiparae</span>, and a <span class="italic">Tractatus super regula ordinis Carmelitarum</span> (ed. in <span class="italic">Speculum ordinis fratrum Carmelitarum</span>, Venice, 1507, and in later collections); and there is evidence he wrote a short treatise on the immaculate conception.<br>
<br>Baconthorpe was one of the theologians who brought English philosophical and theological ideas to Paris in the 1310s and 1320s, and who, in his turn, was influenced by Parisian developments. He sometimes repeats the arguments of his teacher, Robert Walsingham and he is especially close to the secular master Thomas Wilton, from whom he takes his discussion of predestination in his commentary on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> (bk 1, distinctions 40&#150;41). He is usually opposed to the theories of Duns Scotus and those of Henri de Gand. Baconthorpe first lectured on the <span class="italic">Sentences</span> before he knew the work of the Parisian theologian, Pierre Aureole. But in his quodlibets and the written-up <span class="italic">Sentences</span> commentary (especially book 1), Aureole is his main adversary. Baconthorpe argues with him on a wide range of subjects, from Trinitarian relations and the object of theology to the nature of truth (Aureole holds that it is just in the intellect, Baconthorpe considers that it is also in things), and whether God knows each creature distinctly (as Baconthorpe maintains against Aureole). William Ockham's thought seems to have had almost no impact on him (probably because Ockham's work was not known in Paris when Baconthorpe studied and taught there). An unusual feature of the canonical questions on book 4 is their attempt to integrate theology with jurisprudence; although Baconthorpe was not a professional canonist, he shows himself a very able synthesist, far more at home in this field than most theologians.<br>
<br>The aspect of Baconthorpe's work which has most occupied historians is its relation to Averroism. Augusto Nifo judged him to be &#145;the chief [<i>princeps</i>] of the Averroists&#146;, a title that his early biographers were happy to repeat. More recently it has been questioned whether Baconthorpe should be considered an Averroist at all, since that description suggests that he upheld various doctrines incompatible with Christianity, whereas he was in fact very careful to avoid any unorthodoxy. His true position seems to have been more complex than either of these judgements represents. On many occasions Baconthorpe tended to interpret Averroes's own views in a way that diminished or removed their unacceptability to Christians. For instance, he accepted, like almost all his contemporaries, that according to Averroes there is only one <i>intellectus possibilis</i> (&#145;possible intellect&#146;) for all men. But he devised the notion of a &#145;twofold conjunction&#146; between the possible intellect and the individual man, which allowed him to attribute knowing to human individuals, not just to the single possible intellect; and he argued that in a certain way the possible intellect could be considered multiple. Where, however, there is no way of interpreting Averroes in a way acceptable to Christians, Baconthorpe is willing either to ignore him&#151;as he does when discussing human freedom&#151;or to set him aside. For example, he argues that Averroes's Aristotelian reasons for holding that the world must be eternal contradict the principles Averroes himself states elsewhere. None the less, he allows that God could (although he did not) have created the world not in time but eternally. This was Aquinas's position, but Baconthorpe has to justify it against the sophisticated arguments developed since the 1270s.<br>
