<span class="headword">Schach,  Max</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Max Schacherl]</span>  (1886&#150;1957), <span class="occ">film producer</span>, was born on 2 May 1886 in Zenta, Hungary (now Senta, Serbia). Brought up in Vienna, he first worked as a journalist for Berlin newspapers, serving for twelve years as the literary and drama critic of the <span class="italic">Berliner Tageblatt</span>. In 1918 he took his first steps as a film producer in Berlin, collaborating with his wife, Beate <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ehrenfeld (1887/8&#150;1962), a scriptwriter, and the director Karl Grune (born Berthold Gr&uuml;nwald, of Hungarian descent), who became entwined with the couple both professionally and personally for the rest of their lives. In the 1920s Schach worked for Germany's leading film conglomerate Universum Film AG (Ufa) as script editor and manager of its European division. But his most notable contributions to German cinema were made elsewhere. Teamed with Grune at Stern-Film, he produced Grune's innovatory street drama <span class="italic">Die Strasse</span> (1923); working on more commercial lines, they made the lavish historical spectacle <span class="italic">Waterloo</span> (1928) for M&uuml;nchner Lichtspielkunst AG (Emelka). In 1931 Schach became Emelka's general director, with Grune as director of productions; but their technical renewal of facilities and expanded production programme came too late to save the company from impending bankruptcy. Emelka's studio was sold in September 1932 to a new company, Bavaria Film. Both Schach and Grune lost their positions.<br>
<br>Hitler's ascent to power in 1933 increased the necessity for Schach, his wife, and Grune, who were all Jews, to explore new pastures. After a period in Paris, Schach moved to Britain just as the film industry sought to expand its horizons in the wake of the international success of Alexander Korda's <span class="italic">The Private Life of Henry VIII</span> (1933). Much less a public figure than the flamboyant Korda, the diminutive, energetic, chain-smoking Schach quickly established himself as a significant presence in the British industry, though his fortunes were brief and decidedly mixed. His principal company, Capitol Film Productions, later reconfigured as the Capital Film Corporation, was incorporated on 12 July 1934; by October, Grune was directing its debut venture, <span class="italic">Abdul the Damned</span>, mounted in partnership with British International Pictures. Centred on the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 and the deposition of the Ottoman Empire's despotic Sultan Abdul Hamid II, this patchy drama of power, lust, and paranoia set the template for numerous other Schach productions. Strong visual design, a common strength, was tethered to a dishevelled script, one which raised a parallel with the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler only to mute it through frivolous treatment. Dominated by the charismatic presence of the Austrian actor Fritz Kortner, <span class="italic">Abdul</span> further established the strong European stamp of Schach's material and creative personnel, though he also hired Hollywood directors and actors in an ambitious search for international appeal.<br>
<br>The most significant legacy of <span class="italic">Abdul</span> for Schach, and the British film industry as a whole, lay in its manner of financing. A loan of &pound;15,000 was arranged from the Westminster Bank by the brokerage firm Glanville, Enthoven and Co., the amounts underwritten by marine insurance firms in the City&#151;all parties for whom film financing appeared a glamorous pathway to riches, though loan repayments entirely depended on a film production's profits. After July 1935, similar arrangements, but for larger sums, were funnelled through the newly created Aldgate Trustees, a finance source for other British producers, though Schach remained its chief beneficiary. Cushioned by the City's largesse, Schach cultivated every accoutrement of the successful producer: plush London offices at 293 Regent Street; an impressive desk, far bigger than himself; and lavish spending on talent and property. Purchase of rights to Leoncavallo's opera <span class="italic">Pagliacci</span>, separately negotiated with some twenty countries, approached &pound;20,000, a small amount compared with the fee of &pound;60,000 paid with the film's star, the tenor Richard Tauber. Satellite companies soon joined the Capital Film Corporation, each eligible for its own loans. Heralded by the logo of a flaming torch, Capitol's output included Grune's picturesque French Revolution melodrama <span class="italic">The Marriage of Corbal</span> (1936); <span class="italic">When Knights Were Bold</span> (1936), an imperfect but popular showcase for the comedian Jack Buchanan; and a lower-browed Tauber vehicle, the operetta-style <span class="italic">Land Without Music</span> (1936). In the same frantic year, Trafalgar Films, bearing a logo featuring HMS <i>Victory</i>, generated Grune's <span class="italic">Pagliacci</span> (a commercial failure); the rarefied melodrama <span class="italic">Dreaming Lips</span>, featuring Elisabeth Bergner; and Schach's one major box-office success, <span class="italic">Love from a Stranger</span>, a sturdy thriller about a tormented wife, featuring two Hollywood imports, Basil Rathbone and Ann Harding. Cecil Films concentrated on home-grown fare, including several vehicles for the team responsible for the Aldwych Theatre farces: Tom Walls, Ralph Lynn, and the playwright Ben Travers. A renting producer, lacking studio space of his own, Schach relied heavily on the facilities of others, at Elstree or Korda's dream factory at Denham.<br>
<br>Schach's spending and financing habits, similarly pursued by Korda and others, played a notable part in the eventual withdrawal of City finance and the industry's destabilization. By the end of 1937, Capitol's unpaid loans stood at &pound;1,210,000. Schach's bubble had burst, pricked by weak overall box-office takings, inadequate foreign distribution, and mounting industry and City disquiet at the Aldgate Trustees' activities. Earlier in the year, F. D. Klingender and Stuart Legg's book <span class="italic">Money Behind the Screen</span>, expanded from an investigative report published in the magazine <span class="italic">World Film News</span>, had laid bare the suspect financial structures on which the British film industry relied. Korda's substantial borrowings from the Prudential Assurance Company were highlighted, though it was Schach's career and companies that ground to a halt in April 1938 after eighteen films, with only one ancillary company, Grafton Films, soldiering on to make the successful version of A. J. Cronin's novel <span class="italic">The Stars Look Down</span> (1939), a project originally launched by Grune.<br>
<br>As Schach's flow of films stopped, the lawsuits started, culminating on 1 May 1939 with a bumper case brought by Westminster Bank against thirty-five insurance companies, where both sides blamed the other for insufficient oversight of loans to the Schach companies totalling &pound;1,500,000. Prosecuting, Stafford Cripps, QC, also singled out the companies' &#145;quite incompetent and inefficient management&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 2 May 1939, 5). The defendants, in turn, entered a counterclaim against Westminster Bank, but after a week of inflammatory revelations the case was settled out of court.<br>
<br>Schach himself, his industry connections severed, remained aloof from the court case; neither side called him as a witness. He tried to keep busy. Following the collapse of his Capitol empire, he had come close to establishing a commercial radio station in Ostend; after the war, plans were laid for a return to film-making with the director and exhibitor George Hoellering. By the time Schach was naturalized as a British citizen on 11 February 1952, official documents described him as a &#145;film producer and adviser&#146;, living in Boscombe, Bournemouth, at the Cliff End Hotel. But financial misfortune continued to dog him; in 1956, now separated from his wife, who had long maintained an intimate relationship with Grune, Schach was moving between London hotels and facing bankruptcy. He died on 3 August 1957 at 35 Cheyne Place, London, of a coronary occlusion caused by atheroma. In the months following, Beate Schach's background relationship with the now retired Grune came to the fore: the pair, both residents of the Cliff End Hotel, married in Bournemouth on 22 January 1958. When Grune died at the hotel on 2 October 1962, Beate took her own life the following day&#151;the last twist in an intense triangular relationship almost worthy of one of the intimate German <i>Kammerspiel</i> films of the 1920s.<br>
<br>At his death, one year after Korda's, Schach had long been a forgotten figure, though his misfortunes stuck with film scholars and historians. He was castigated for contributing &#145;nothing to the industry&#146;  (Low, 207), and was sweepingly labelled &#145;the most universally disliked producer ever to work in British films&#146;  (Kulik, 146). Some at least of his Capitol employees were warmed by his enthusiasm, humour, and quirks. His publicity team called him &#145;the pocket battleship of British films&#146;, fitting enough for a mogul 4 feet 11 inches tall in his shoes who sat at his imposing desk like a &#145;perky griffin&#146; (the description of the journalist Hilde Marchant), masterminding his raft of productions. In bulk they have not survived the years that well. Korda's product, at its best, was well-balanced and robustly imaginative; Schach's remained off-kilter, with design, material, and players usually imperfectly aligned, except for the powerful melodrama of <span class="italic">Love from a Stranger</span>, directed by Rowland V. Lee.<br>
<br>Other factors worked against Schach. At a time when Britain's film unions mounted vocal complaints against the numbers of foreign technicians employed in the studios, Schach and his product drew particular ire, some coloured with anti-Semitism. <span class="italic">The Marriage of Corbal</span> inspired Graham Greene, writing in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (5 June 1936), to a particularly ferocious rant at this &#145;alien invasion&#146;; other commentators found Schach and Korda easy targets in a period of industry turmoil. Time may not erase the inbuilt flaws in Schach's own films, but a more temperate assessment of his activities may yet emerge as historians consider other ingredients in the film industry's collapse&#151;from Hollywood's crushing market dominance to the panicking of na&iuml;ve investors, so easily charmed by the griffin at his desk.<br>
