<span class="headword">Eadric of Laxfield</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1066?), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was one of the major landholders before 1066. All that is known of him comes from <span class="roman">Little Domesday</span>, the return of the Domesday commissioners for the East Anglian circuit, which reveals that he had held some 123 carucates of land in Suffolk and Norfolk. He had also attracted the commendation of large numbers of lesser thegns and free men; just how many it is impossible to say, since most of them are unnamed, but a minimum of eighty-two named individuals can be identified. <span class="roman">Little Domesday</span> also records the outlawry of Eadric at some time in Edward the Confessor's reign, though unfortunately the reason is unspecified. His lands were confiscated by the king and his men sought other lords. When he was subsequently pardoned and reinstated, Edward issued a writ permitting Eadric's men to return to their allegiance, if their lord wished it  (<span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 2.310<i>v</i>&#150;311). This was the cause of several disputes after 1066, when Eadric's lands were redistributed among the incoming Normans. In theory, commendation had no bearing on the ownership of the commended man's land, but many post-conquest lords appropriated the estates of men commended to their predecessors as well as those belonging to the predecessors themselves. Indeed it seems that many lesser thegns and free men, deprived of the support of their dead or dispossessed lords, actively sought the protection of those who had supplanted them; and, moreover, brought their lands with them, even if those lands had formed part of a manor belonging to a landowner other than the former lord. Thus the land of Stanwine at Heveningham was claimed by Robert Malet because Stanwine had once been commended to his predecessor, Eadric of Laxfield, even though the tenement in question was attached to the manor of Peasenhall, held by Northmann, the predecessor of Roger (I) Bigod; and Stanwine himself offered to prove that he had still been commended to Eadric on the day of King Edward's death, even though the local hundred jury testified that he was at that time the man of Earl Harold  (<span class="italic">Domesday Book</span>, 2.313, 332).<br>
<br>Eadric's name is one of the commonest in eleventh-century England, and only where <span class="roman">Little Domesday</span> gives him the distinctive toponymic from his estate at Laxfield in Suffolk (or refers to him as the antecessor of Robert Malet) can he be securely identified. For this reason the identification of Eadric of Laxfield with Eadric Cecus (Eadric the Blind), whom <span class="roman">Domesday</span> records as a king's thegn in Wiltshire, must be regarded as dubious; especially as it seems unlikely that Eadric of Laxfield was living in 1086. Most of his land had passed either to William Malet, who was killed in 1071, and thence to his son Robert, or (in Norfolk) to Ralph de Gael, exiled in 1076, and thence to the king (Happisburg and probably Eaton) or to Roger Bigod (Sutton). All these men were in royal service, either as sheriffs of Suffolk or (in Ralph's case) as earl of East Anglia, and this pattern of distribution suggests that Eadric had died in or soon after 1066 and that his lands had been taken into the king's hand and used to endow the local royal officials.<br>
