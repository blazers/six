<span class="headword">Villiers,  Edward</span>, first earl of Jersey  (1655?&#150;1711), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Edward Villiers (1620&#150;1689), knight marshal, and his first wife, Frances (1630&#150;1677), youngest daughter of Theophilus Howard, second earl of Suffolk. Villiers entered St John's College, Cambridge, on 17 March 1671, aged sixteen. Villiers's father&#151;a member of the Sealed Knot during the 1650s&#151;was very much a courtier and in 1676 Villiers obtained the reversion of his father's post as knight marshal. Together with his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28290/', "Elizabeth Villiers")</script> (who may later have become William III's mistress), Villiers accompanied Princess Mary to the Netherlands in 1677 on the occasion of her marriage to William of Orange. On 8 December 1681 Villiers was licensed to marry Barbara (1662/3&#150;1735), daughter of William Chiffinch, keeper of the backstairs to Charles II. Villiers returned with William in 1688 and was soon a favourite of the new court. He became Queen Mary's master of horse in February 1689 and succeeded his father in July. On 20 March 1691 he was created Baron Villiers of Hoo and Viscount Villiers of Dartford. He was made ranger of Hyde Park in 1693, a post he kept until February 1702. However, the death of Queen Mary on 28 December 1694 made his office as master of the horse redundant.<br>
<br>Villiers was then employed as a diplomat, being named on 17&#150;18 May 1695 as envoy-extraordinary to the states general of the United Provinces and arriving in Rotterdam on 8 July. On 26 February 1697 he was made envoy-extraordinary and -plenipotentiary to the peace conference at Rijswijk (Ryswick), and at the suggestion of the earl of Sunderland he was made a lord justice of Ireland in April 1697. His Catholic wife may have caused Villiers problems in this regard, but he did not leave the United Provinces until November of that year. Before his return he was created, on 13 October 1697, earl of Jersey and was made a privy councillor on 25 November 1697. On 26 July 1698 he was made ambassador-extraordinary to France, and arrived in Paris on 11 September 1698; he spent part of November and December in the Netherlands, and returned from France on 26 May 1699.<br>
<br>Although a nominal tory, Jersey was primarily a courtier, and moreover a friend of the new court favourite the earl of Albemarle. This no doubt smoothed his appointment on 13 May 1699 as secretary of state for the southern department, taking the senior secretaryship even though he was technically junior to James Vernon. As befitted his new office he was named a lord justice in June 1699, when William III was away on the continent during the summer. Jersey was also a signatory of the second partition treaty, even though he and Albemarle intrigued against it, possibly because he was not included in most of the negotiations. Jersey was also now one of the key ministerial servants in the House of Lords and acted as a conduit of information for the king. Thus, when the houses became deadlocked over the resumption of Irish forfeited estates in April 1700 it was Jersey whom Henry Boyle sought out to communicate with the king, and Jersey who lobbied peers to avoid the loss of the bill (which included the land tax) and back down over amending the bill. In June 1700 he exchanged his secretaryship for the post of lord chamberlain. In May&#150;June 1701 Jersey came under attack from whigs seeking to defend their colleagues under threat of impeachment for their role in the partition treaty, but his affinity with the new tory ministry protected him, and Speaker Harley ruled an attempt to impeach him as out of order. This did not prevent his voting on 17 June 1701 against the acquittal of Lord Somers.<br>
<br>Jersey retained his office as lord chamberlain following the accession of Queen Anne in March 1702, but his relations with the queen were somewhat frosty, probably owing to the perceived slights suffered by the queen when Princess Anne after she had come into conflict with her sister and retired from court in February 1692. As it was, his son lost a lucrative post as teller of the exchequer. In fact Jersey was one of many tory politicians in office at the beginning of Anne's reign. However, he was also critical of the military strategy of the duke of Marlborough and by June 1703 he was described as one of those who &#145;does not do the Queen that service they ought to do&#146;  (Snyder, 1.202). He voted in favour of both the first and second occasional conformity bills in 1703. His dismissal in April 1704 for persistently obstructing the policies of Godolphin and Marlborough brought protests from the earl of Nottingham and a personal justification from Jersey to the queen as he was reported to be &#145;extremely surprised, not being conscious of any crime of omission or commission that might deserve such a disgrace&#146;  (ibid., 1.284n.).<br>
<br>Jersey joined the tories in opposition. When a tory propagandist in <span class="italic">The Memorial of the Church of England</span> cast aspersions on Marlborough's and Godolphin's commitment to the church, Marlborough laughed at the idea of Jersey as a pillar of the church given that he &#145;would have been a Quaker or any other religion that might have pleased the late king&#146;  (Snyder, 1.475). He was omitted from the privy council following the union with Scotland in 1707. Jersey voted on 20 March 1710 in favour of a lenient punishment following the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. The new ministry formed under Robert Harley later in 1710 would have liked to employ Jersey, possibly in the Admiralty, but this proposal foundered on the queen's obstinate refusal to employ him on the grounds that he was a Jacobite. Jersey certainly had good links in the diplomatic community and among the Catholics to act as a secret agent in Harley's peace strategy, as it was Jersey who met with Gaultier and thus initiated the process which ended at Utrecht. The death of the duke of Newcastle in July 1711 presented a suitable opportunity to reward Jersey with the post of lord privy seal, aided by Jersey's disavowal of his Jacobitism in a letter to Harley. Unfortunately on the morning of 26 August, the day his appointment was to be made public, he collapsed at his house near St James's and died of a &#145;gout in his stomach or apoplexy, or both&#146;  (Swift, 345). He was in his fifty-sixth year.<br>
<br>Jersey was buried on 4 September in Westminster Abbey. Macky's comment was that &#145;he hath gone through all the great offices of the kingdom with a very ordinary understanding&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>). Jersey died in debt and his wife sold what she could and fled to France with her youngest son, Henry. This caused considerable embarrassment to Jersey's heir, William, and was made worse by her Catholicism and Jacobitism, which saw him created a Jacobite peer. She died in Paris on 22 July 1735.<br>
<br>Jersey's eldest son and successor, <a name="cosubject_28304"></a><span class="headword">William Villiers</span>, second earl of Jersey  (<em>c.</em>1682&#150;1721), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was known as Viscount Villiers from 1697 to 1711. Villiers entered Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1699, and graduated MA in 1700. He was appointed teller of the exchequer in 1701, but on the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 exchanged the post for a pension. On 22 March 1705, at Hampstead, he married Judith Herne (<i>d</i>. 1732), daughter of Frederick Herne, a London merchant. They had two sons, William, later third earl of Jersey (<i>d</i>. 1769), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28302/', "Thomas Villiers, later first earl of Clarendon (1709&#150;1786)")</script>, and a daughter, Barbara. Both Lord and Lady Villiers gained reputations for extramarital affairs. In May 1705 he was elected member of parliament for Kent, but his performance was criticized and he did not seek re-election in 1708. He succeeded his father as earl of Jersey in 1711, and supported the Oxford ministry in the Lords. He remained a tory following the fall of Oxford and the accession of George I. His mother's overt Jacobitism led him to be arrested on suspicion of treason in 1715; he was created earl of Jersey in the Jacobite peerage by the Stuart pretender, &#145;James III&#146;, in 1716. He was in Paris on grounds of ill health in 1718, and died at Castlethorpe, Buckinghamshire, on 13 July 1721, and was buried on 23 July at Westerham, Kent, near the family home of Squerries. He left his wife, Judith, &#145;having refused to settle her lands on her children, and for other sufficient reasons not proper to be mentioned here&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 7.89), one shilling.<br>
