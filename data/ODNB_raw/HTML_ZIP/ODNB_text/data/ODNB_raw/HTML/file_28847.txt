<span class="headword">Watson,  John Forbes</span>  (1827&#150;1892), <span class="occ">physician and expert on India</span>, was baptized on 20 June 1827, at Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, the son of George Watson, a farmer, and his wife, Jean McHardy. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen and graduated MA and MD in 1847. He continued his medical training at Guy's Hospital, London, and in Paris. In 1850 he was appointed assistant surgeon to the Bombay Army Medical Service. His Indian experience included medical service to the artillery at Ahmednagar; to the Sind horse at Kangur; to the Jamsetjee Hospital, where he was assistant surgeon; and to Grant Medical College, where he lectured on physiology and clinical medicine. After returning to England on sick leave in 1853, he studied the sanitary uses of charcoal for the Royal School of Mines in London, and published a pamphlet on the subject in 1855. He then returned to his interests in India, cataloguing and investigating its useful plants at the behest of the India Office's court of directors; he published his index in 1868. He was named director of the India Museum in London in 1858. From the mid-1850s his Indian interests largely supplanted his medical practice.<br>
<br>Watson selected the materials and wrote the catalogue for the Indian department of the London International Exhibition of 1862. This brought him into the circle, led by Henry Cole, that had been central to the shaping of London's South Kensington Museum; to international exhibitions on the site (as well as British contributions to foreign exhibitions); and to the reshaping of the Schools of Design according to principles of industrial art. In Cole's view the future of English industrialism depended on training manufacturers and workers as well as the consuming public on the proper principles of design.<br>
<br>The influence of such thinking was clear in Watson's next major project, <span class="italic">The Textile Manufactures and the Costumes of the People of India</span> (1866). The project, simultaneously an ethnographic catalogue and a brief for increased commerce with India, included a text by Watson detailing the cultural uses of specific costumes by Indians and twenty sets of an eighteen-volume collection of samples of Indian textiles, each including some 700 samples. Watson, terming the volumes &#145;industrial museums&#146;  (<span class="italic">Textile Manufactures</span>, 1), arranged for their distribution to twelve English cities and seven sites in India (with one copy retained by the India Museum). The distribution of these catalogues and samples to industrial cities in Great Britain and key craft centres in India was intended to acquaint British producers with the forms and styles of Indian costume, while preserving Indian craft traditions. The catalogue employed photographs to illustrate the proper wearing of Indian clothing.<br>
<br>Watson sought to encourage commerce between the countries, especially by training English manufacturers in the needs of the Indian people. &#145;India is in a position to become a magnificent customer&#146;, Watson wrote, but only if &#145;we endeavour to make the articles which we know will be liked and needed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Textile Manufactures</span>, 2). Watson insisted that the development of widened commerce between Britain and India would benefit both partners, especially as wider knowledge led to a demand for Indian handicrafts in Britain.<br>
<br>The same central principles of encouraging broader trade through education in the principles of Indian design shaped Watson's reorganization of the India Museum in 1870. Watson continued, too, to be actively engaged in selecting and cataloguing Indian works for international exhibitions, including those in Paris (1867), Vienna (1873), and Philadelphia (1876), as well as the annual international exhibitions in South Kensington from 1871 to 1874. Reviewing these, the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> singled out Watson's &#145;power of organization, and clear method of imparting information&#146;  (&#145;Indian court&#146;, 208).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Watson's broader interests in promoting commerce between Britain and India led him to investigate a wide range of Indian products. He called for a comprehensive survey of Indian goods and products in a pamphlet of 1872. He published works on Indian tobacco (1871), tea cultivation (1872), rheea fibre (1875), and wheat (1879), as well as on the applicability of cotton gins to Indian cotton (1879). He expanded his &#145;industrial museums&#146; of samples of Indian textiles with a new multi-volume set in 1872&#150;4.<br>
<br>Watson continued to pioneer photography as a method of illustrating works, establishing a photographic department in the India Office in 1865. He collaborated with J. K. Kaye to produce an ethnographic survey of India (<span class="italic">Peoples of India</span>, 8 vols., 1868&#150;75), and with James Fergusson he documented the Indian classical architecture (displayed at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867 and published in 1869). Watson also proposed the reorganization of the India Museum and its libraries in 1874, paving the way for its reconsolidation in South Kensington in 1879.<br>
<br>Watson retired from the India Office soon after the relocation of the museum, in 1880. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1889. He died at his home, 56 Belvedere Road, Upper Norwood, Surrey, on 29 July 1892. He was survived by his widow, Amelia Mary Anne Watson.<br>
