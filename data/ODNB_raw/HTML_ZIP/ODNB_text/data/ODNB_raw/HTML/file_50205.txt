<span class="headword">Mackenzie,  William</span>  (1794&#150;1851), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 20 March 1794 at Marsden Chapel, Nelson, Lancashire, the eldest of the eleven children of Alexander Mackenzie (1769&#150;1836), contractor, and Mary Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1828). His father had moved south from Muirton, Ross-shire, working as a navvy on the Forth and Clyde Canal, and as a contractor on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, for both of which Robert Whitworth was engineer. Following a peripatetic childhood linked to his father's contracts around Lancashire, William began an apprenticeship with a Blackburn weaver, but abandoned this for civil engineering. In 1811 he became a pupil of Thomas Clapham, a lock carpenter on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. He then worked for John Clapham on a dry dock at Troon harbour before joining John Cargill, one of Thomas Telford's favourite contractors, on Craigellachie Bridge. He completed his early training as an agent for his father's old friend, Hugh McIntosh, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal from 1816 to 1822. On 9 November 1819 he married Mary (1789&#150;1838), daughter of James Dalziel, a Glasgow commission agent.<br>
<br>In 1822 Mackenzie assisted McIntosh in estimating for the completion of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal, becoming one of the agents when McIntosh was awarded the contract. Soon after he was appointed resident engineer on Telford's Mythe Bridge, Tewkesbury. Mackenzie described this work in a paper published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> (2.1) of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which he had joined in 1828. Before the bridge was completed Mackenzie was appointed resident engineer, again under Telford, on the Birmingham Canal improvements. This involved the supervision of some of the largest excavations ever built on a British canal. On its completion Mackenzie returned to contracting, and in 1832 successfully tendered for the tunnel works on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway between Edge Hill and Lime Street. The work proved profitable. As the 1830s progressed Mackenzie took other profitable contracts on the Grand Junction, north Union, Midland Counties, and Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock railways. He took other, less successful, contracts on the London and Birmingham, and Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock, and Ayr lines, combining this with consultancy work for canal and waterworks companies, and more general contracting such as the Liverpool Haymarket and the Manchester and Sheffield Junction Canal. Some of his outstanding works were on the Shannon navigation (1841&#150;7), where he was the only contractor who did not become involved in litigation with the commissioners.<br>
<br>Despite the personal setbacks of the loss of his father in 1836 and the death of his first wife in December 1838, Mackenzie's business prospered. He had already had a small staff while working on the Birmingham Canal, notably his brother-in-law William Dalziel, and Francis Jenkins. His youngest brother, Edward (1811&#150;1880), joined him in 1834, and George Woodhouse in 1840.<br>
<br>Mackenzie's experience and reliability led to an approach by Joseph Locke (1805&#150;1860) in the summer of 1840 about a tunnel contract at Rolleboise on the Paris to Rouen railway. After visiting France, Mackenzie agreed with Thomas Brassey (1805&#150;1870) later that year to tender jointly for works on the line. Construction began in 1841, when Mackenzie moved to Paris, and over the next decade Mackenzie and Brassey became the dominant force in European railway contracting. Following the successful completion of the Paris to Rouen line in 1843 Mackenzie was approached by capitalists from all over Europe. In France he was heavily involved with the companies which obtained the Orl&eacute;ans to Bordeaux and Tours to Nantes railway concessions, as well as several other companies which failed or had their concessions revoked in the 1848 period. In Spain, which he visited twice, he was involved in several schemes including a railway from Madrid to Bilbao, improvements to the Ebro navigation, and organizing surveys on behalf of railway promoters, such as Salamanca. He was active in the Italian states. In Belgium he was a major shareholder in the concession for the Tournai to Jurboise and Landen to Hasselt railways, and tendered for other works.<br>
<br>As contractors Mackenzie and Brassey built the Rouen to Le Havre railway and its extension to Dieppe, the Abb&eacute;ville to Boulogne section of the Amiens&#150;Boulogne line, the Orl&eacute;ans&#150;Bordeaux railway, and part of the Rhine and Marne Canal. They also built the first line in Spain, between Barcelona and Mataro. In Britain they built the Eastern Union Railway, part of the Chester and Holyhead Railway, the North Staffordshire Railway, the north Wales mineral lines extension to Shrewsbury, the Liverpool and Ormskirk Railway, the Trent valley railway, and the Lancaster and Carlisle and the associated line to Kendal and Windermere. They built the massive railway system associated with the Caledonian Railway, including subsidiary lines such as the Scottish Midland and Scottish Central railways. Dock and harbour work was carried out at Greenock and Birkenhead. Many of the British contracts were carried out in partnership with John Stephenson (<i>c</i>.1794&#150;1848) beginning with the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway in 1844. Contracts were taken in a variety of names: William Mackenzie &amp; Co., Mackenzie and Brassey, John Stephenson &amp; Co., Thomas Brassey &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Mackenzie had other investments outside railways. He was one of the original shareholders in the scheme to revive Brymbo ironworks with other former associates of Hugh McIntosh. With Brassey he took shares in the Allcard and Buddicom works near Rouen, and, less successfully, ironworks at Evreux and Pont-Audemer. In Liverpool, in association with Henry Edwards, a local architect and builder, he began to develop land for housing. He also acquired estates at Craigs, Newbie, and Auchenskeoch in Scotland.<br>
<br>For most of his life Mackenzie had followed work around the country. From 1832 he maintained a home and offices in Liverpool and from 1841 in Paris. In 1843 he moved to 74 Grove Street, Liverpool, and began to improve it extensively, no doubt influenced by the fashionable standards of Paris. Like other distinguished engineers such as Telford he surrounded himself with images of engineering. He commissioned illustrations of his own works, and he bought or commissioned portraits of other engineers whom he knew such as Telford, John Woodhouse, and Alexander Mackenzie Ross. The portrait of Mackenzie by T. H. Illidge was presented to his second wife, Sarah Dewhurst (1807&#150;1867), whom he had married on 31 December 1839, at a banquet in Paris in January 1846. It portrays a commanding stout figure, with receding hair, dominating the landscape. Mackenzie was then at the height of his powers and influence.<br>
<br>Mackenzie was, with Thomas Brassey, the leading European contractor in the 1840s. He had far more experience than most of the engineers and contractors working at the time, which contributed to the rapid and successful expansion of the network in the years of railway mania. His financial resources, enormous by the standards of previous generations, enabled him to invest in plant to a greater extent than before. He was the first contractor to purchase locomotives for moving spoil, in 1832, and in the 1840s pioneered the use of steam excavators on the Rouen to Le Havre railway. In January 1848 he fell seriously ill from gangrene. This coincided with serious problems arising from the near bankruptcy and subsequent death of John Stephenson, and the general financial and political crisis of 1848. Although Mackenzie recovered, and was active for a further eighteen months until he again fell ill at the end of 1849, Brassey decided to end the partnership. By separate agreements in February and October 1850 concerning their British and continental contracts the responsibility for completing the majority of the contracts was passed to Brassey, with the exception of the Orl&eacute;ans to Bordeaux line, which Mackenzie was to complete with his brother Edward. By the arbitration of Robert Stephenson and Alexander Mackenzie Ross, Mackenzie received a payment for his share in the profits of the outstanding British contracts, which included several, such as the Great Northern Railway, which Brassey claimed were carried out using his capital alone.<br>
<br>Although Mackenzie continued to conduct business until his death on 29 October 1851 he never fully recovered his health, having lost his left foot in 1850. He died at his home, 74 Grove Street, Liverpool. Both his marriages were childless, and although his widow continued to live in the family house until her death in 1867, he left almost his entire estate of &pound;341,848 to his youngest brother, Edward, including his interest in the Orl&eacute;ans to Bordeaux contracts, which Edward completed. Edward went on to die a millionaire. In 1868 he erected a monument to William Mackenzie at the Scottish church of St Andrew, Rodney Street, Liverpool, where he had been buried.<br>
