<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Frost, Sir  Terence Ernest Manitou <span class="st"> [Terry]</span></span>  (1915&#150;2003), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 13 October 1915 at 27 Rugby Road, Leamington Spa, the son of Ernest Walter Frost, who was then serving as a bombardier with the 97th Royal Field Artillery, and his wife, Millicent Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lines.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandwartimeincarceration"></a>Early life and wartime incarceration</h2>His father left his mother when Frost was still young, and he was raised by his grandmother, Edith Lines, and relied on three uncles for paternal influences. He was educated at Rugby Road school, Leamington Spa, and from about 1926 at Leamington Spa central school. Though in later life he would recall early signs of creativity, including creative writing and an interest in drawing and decorative arts, he was originally destined for work in the light industries of the midlands. He left school at fourteen and a subsequent series of jobs included employment at Curry's bicycle shop in Leamington Spa, a bakery, the Armstrong Whitworth aircraft factory in Coventry (where, he later claimed, he painted the red, white, and blue roundels on RAF planes), and an electrical components wholesaler. During a period of unemployment he took evening classes in drawing and joined the Territorial Army.<br>
<br>As a member of the Territorial Army Frost was called up as soon as the Second World War broke out in September 1939. Having served in France, Palestine, and the Lebanon, he joined the commandos as a corporal and with them saw service in the Sudan and Crete, where he was captured in June 1941. He was imprisoned in Salonika, then Poland, and finally in Stalag 383 in Hohenfels, Bavaria. There he felt a &#145;tremendous spiritual experience, a more aware or heightened perception during starvation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Sept 2003). He renewed his interest in art, producing many portraits of his fellow prisoners of war using a variety of recycled material for supports and paints. By chance he met Adrian Heath, a young artist who had abandoned the Slade School of Art for wartime service. Heath encouraged and mentored Frost, who thus gained a better knowledge of the history of art as well as of technique. After liberation Frost returned to Leamington. On 11 August 1945, at St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, he married Kathleen May (Kath) Clarke, a 23-year-old engineer's machine operator, and daughter of George Clarke, engineer. They had five sons and a daughter.<h2>
<a name="CamberwellandStIves"></a>Camberwell and St Ives</h2>Frost returned to his job selling electrical components, but he became frustrated at not being able to fulfil his desire to be an artist, and fell ill. He secured a serviceman's grant and, with Heath's help, a place at Camberwell School of Art. At the same time, again on Heath's advice, he and Kath moved to St Ives, Cornwall, then becoming established as a centre for avant-garde artistic practice. There life was hard as they lived initially in a caravan and took odd jobs as domestic servants, housekeepers, postal workers, and so on. It was probably in 1946 that they secured 12 Quay Street, which remained their home until they left St Ives for good in 1961. Initially Frost painted in his bedroom or at the St Ives School of Painting, where he attended classes. He soon integrated into the artistic community of St Ives, getting to know such contemporaries as Peter Lanyon, John Wells, Denis Mitchell, Sven Berlin, Patrick Heron, and Bryan Wynter. Through Lanyon he met Ben Nicholson, who would be an important supporter, and Barbara Hepworth, for whom he worked as an assistant in 1950&#150;51. For a while he occupied a space close to Nicholson in the historic Porthmeor studios.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, from the autumn of 1947, Frost attended Camberwell School of Art. The regime there under William Coldstream promoted figurative painting and the idea of objective vision. With a tendency towards a more formalist approach already emerging, Frost found himself torn, and his work of those years varied widely. An important mentor was Victor Pasmore, a tutor at Camberwell who was himself moving away from representational painting and towards total abstraction. Pasmore appropriated Coldstream's dependence on geometric composition and, in particular, the golden section, for abstract purposes, and Frost did likewise. This classical geometric formula was used in the work he made in 1949 in response to an assignment based on &#145;a madrigal&#146;. Frost took W. H. Auden's poem of that name and produced a largely abstract composition, <span class="italic">Madrigal</span> (Leamington Spa Art Gallery), in which shapes and colours alluded both to the details of the poem and to the emotions it evoked. The abstraction of external references, the expression of subjective emotions they provoked, a geometric composition, and a passionate engagement with poetry would become staples of Frost's work.<br>
<br>During his time at Camberwell Frost commuted from St Ives and lodged in Albert Bridge Road, Battersea. Through his friends in Cornwall and, in particular, Pasmore and Heath, he immersed himself in the history of abstract art. In St Ives, a breakthrough work led to a series of abstract compositions based on the shapes and movements of the town's harbour. <span class="italic">Walk along the Quay</span> (1950; priv. coll., on loan to Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield) is non-representational, using the golden section as its compositional determinant. Its forms, however, were suggested by the shapes defined by the arc of a swaying mast or the slack curve of a rope hanging between boat and quay. Frost used a long, thin board and progressed up it in imitation of his original walk along the quay. The semicircles and half-ellipses of this composition would become common features of his work for several years and would return later in life. As well as leading to Frost's first mature series of paintings, it impressed Nicholson enough for him to begin promoting Frost. It was included in the important exhibition of abstract art at the Artists' International Association Galleries in 1951, and in 1952 Frost had his first solo exhibition in London at the Leicester Galleries, where he showed regularly until 1958.<br>
<br>Frost became associated with a group of artists known as the constructionists, which included Pasmore, Heath, Kenneth and Mary Martin, Anthony Hill, and others. He showed with them in several exhibitions at Heath's studio in Fitzroy Street, London. The group reached its high point in 1954 with the publication <span class="italic">Nine Abstract Artists</span>, which included an introduction by Lawrence Alloway as well as images and a statement by each of the artists. The book was accompanied by an exhibition at the Redfern Gallery. In his introduction Alloway drew a distinction between those of the constructionists whose art was completely non-representational and those, including Frost, Roger Hilton, and William Scott, who retained external references. He dismissed the latter group's reluctance to abandon picturesque references. This tension between total abstraction and the natural world would, however, remain central to Frost's art. At the same time Frost was teaching life drawing at Bath Academy of Art, Corsham Court (1952&#150;4), and occasional classes at Willesden Art School, London; this was the beginning of a long and fruitful teaching career.<h2>
<a name="Yorkshire"></a>Yorkshire</h2>In 1954 Frost became the first Gregory fellow in painting at Leeds University. The publisher E. C. Gregory, already a collector of his work, established fellowships in painting, sculpture, poetry, and music, to bring the creative arts into the life of the university. The fellows' formal duties extended little beyond the odd lecture and being available for students. Leeds College of Art at that time was developing a ground-breaking introductory course under the leadership of Harry Thubron and, inevitably, Frost became involved. The course&#151;&#145;basic design&#146;&#151;was based on Bauhaus principles and became a model for British art education from the 1960s. Though the fellowship provided the Frosts with more security than they had enjoyed since the war, life for their large family was still austere, as is clear from photographs of the time by Frost's friend Roger Mayne. In Leeds, Frost embarked upon a new, and perhaps his most powerful and original, body of work. Again the paintings were based on his experience of and subjective response to landscape. The experience of the Yorkshire dales in the snow led to the use of stark black and white contrasts leavened with small areas of other colours. New forms emerged, apparently partly inspired by the sight of a low sun through bare trees: vertical forms, a polygon, and a fan-like pattern of striations which were, Frost claimed, inspired by the sight of sheep's tails spinning in the wind. With a larger scale and more expansive forms, Frost sought to recreate the sensation of being in dramatic nature. His descriptions of these occasions (&#145;moments of being&#146;) and his work associated him with the tradition of sublime landscape painting and its concern to express the existential state of feeling minuscule and vulnerable in the face of nature's enormity and power. This, more than the works' appearance, associated Frost with his American contemporaries like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, whose work was just becoming known in Britain.<h2>
<a name="StIvesBanburyandNewlyn"></a>St Ives, Banbury, and Newlyn</h2>By 1958, when Frost returned to St Ives from Leeds, he was well established as a leading artist. That year he joined the new Waddington Galleries in London, where he exhibited regularly until 1978. He was consistently included in major exhibitions of abstract art in Britain and in British Council exhibitions that toured the world. In 1960 he had his first solo exhibition in the United States, at the Bertha Schaeffer Gallery, New York. In 1964 a retrospective exhibition toured from Newcastle to York, Hull, and Bradford and, in the same year, an exhibition toured to San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and San Jos&eacute;, where Frost was teaching for the summer at the University of California. In 1961, Frost had moved from St Ives to 2 Old Parr Road, Banbury, Oxfordshire. He taught for a short time at Coventry Art College and then at Reading University, where he worked full time from 1965. He became professor of painting there in 1977, and professor emeritus in 1981.<br>
<br>No doubt affected by the flat surfaces, unmodulated colour, and simple forms of American abstract painting in the 1960s, Frost's work became progressively more simple. He continued, however, to look to external references. The fronts of lorries became an important source of inspiration, for example, as did road signs and the civil war flags seen in the chapel of Compton Wynyates. Works such as <span class="italic">M17, October 1962</span> (British Council) are more emblematic than those of the Leeds and St Ives years. This work is made up of a series of forms; gradually these would be reduced in number and complexity until in a work such as <span class="italic">June 1965, Red and Black</span> (Tate collection) there are only six red or black shapes against a field of white, the gaps between the shapes providing the tension of the composition. The new simplicity of these paintings was further enhanced by Frost's use of acrylic as opposed to oil paint. Despite their apparently totally abstract nature, Frost still associated his bulging shapes with external sources&#151;boats and the female body in particular. The latter was made explicit in a relief in which semicircular forms protrude bulbously, and which he subtitled &#145;Mae West&#146;. The implication of movement and weight became an interest in Frost's work of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Using increasingly vivid colours, he produced a series of paintings of &#145;suspended forms&#146; in which areas of colour bulge downwards a little like balloons full of water. Another series of paintings in which columns of semicircles lean or curve to one side was apparently inspired by the leaning tower of Pisa or by the trajectory of the space flights to the moon in those years. This aspect of his work led him to make a small number of sculptures: soft, suspended forms in the 1970s and rocking constructions in the 1980s.<br>
<br>In 1974 Frost bought a house and studio in Newlyn, a former artists' colony a few miles from St Ives. At the top of a hill above the village, Gernickfield House and Studio, Tredavoe Lane, offered extraordinary views across Newlyn and Mounts Bay. Its position allowed Frost to see the sun rise in the morning and set later in the west. The harbour, boats, sea, and what Frost described as the &#145;two gods&#146;&#151;the sun and moon&#151;became recurrent themes in his work as a representational element began to re-emerge. Having established a reputation as a purveyor of brightly coloured, joyous paintings, Frost increasingly associated himself with sunny climes and cultures. In 1977 he made the first of many visits to Cyprus, and the colours of the island and, in particular, the motif of the black olive entered his work. On occasion these celebrations of life were produced despite profound despair at the state of the world and his own situation. Having had, in 1976, an important retrospective that toured Britain before showing at the Serpentine Gallery, London, Frost felt his career had slowed down. He still relied on teaching for his income and broke off his relationship with Waddington Galleries.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Frost's new-found independence and his retirement from Reading University in 1981 opened up a period of massive productivity as he anxiously sought to maximize exhibitions and sales. This he did with great success, and it might be said that he became over-productive. His output was not limited to painting: he produced sculptures, jewellery, and ceramics. His interventions in the decorative arts included watches for the Royal Academy and five new tailfin designs for British Airways. In 1998 he made his first glass sculptures in collaboration with a foundry in Murano, Venice. Most importantly, he became a prolific printmaker, and it could be argued that during the 1990s his prints were his most successful products aesthetically as well as commercially. A crucial work was the portfolio <span class="italic">Eleven Poems by Federico Garcia Lorca</span> (1989), which was the culmination of a long-standing fascination with Lorca's poetry. The combination of sensual pleasure and an awareness of death that both occupy Lorca's concept of <i>duende</i> fitted perfectly Frost's own visual reinterpretation of nature and the sublime.<br>
<br>By the end of the twentieth century Terry Frost was one of the best-known artists in Britain. He had been elected a Royal Academician in 1992, and in 2000 had a small retrospective exhibition in the academy's Sackler Galleries. Though his critical reputation among the art world <i>cognoscenti</i> was not what it had been, he was one of a small band of artists whose names reached beyond those narrow confines to the wider consciousness. In recognition of this status, he was knighted in 1998. His work is well represented in the collections of Tate, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the national galleries of Scotland and of Wales, and can also be found in most major regional art galleries around the UK, and in the USA, Canada, Israel, and Portugal.<br>
<br>Following a relatively short illness, Frost died of cancer on 1 September 2003 at St Julia's Hospice, Hayle, close to St Ives. Following a funeral at St Peter's Church, Newlyn, he was cremated at Truro on 9 September. He was survived by his wife, Kathleen, and their six children.<br>
