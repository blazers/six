<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Innes,  John</span>  (1829&#150;1904), <span class="occ">property developer, and philanthropist</span>, was born on 20 January 1829 in Hampstead, Middlesex, and baptized on 23 February 1829 at All Souls, St Marylebone, the sixth of seven known children of John Innes (1786&#150;1869), a West Indies merchant of Mincing Lane and Moorgate Street in the City of London, and his wife, Mary Reid (1792&#150;1849). His father was the author of reports to the government on the West Indies and the abolition of slavery, and his mother was the daughter of Andrew Reid MP, of Lyonsdown, Barnet, Hertfordshire, the founder of Reid's Brewery. His paternal grandparents were from Huntly, Scotland. John Innes never married.<br>
<br>After living in family homes in Kensington Square and then in Porchester Terrace in the parish of Paddington, Innes attended boarding-school in Brighton until the age of sixteen. He and his elder brother James, a London merchant (later of Roffey Park, Sussex), became wine importers of Mincing Lane, in the City. In 1864 they founded the City of London Real Property Company in Mark Lane; it subsequently became a subsidiary of Land Securities plc. In 1903 John followed James as director and chairman after the latter's death.<br>
<br>From the mid-1860s the brothers acquired land in Merton and Morden, Surrey, including several farms. John Innes rebuilt the farmhouse of Manor Farm, Merton, as his home, Manor House. He visited his father and sister in Porchester Terrace frequently. While James Innes concentrated on the City company, John, in association with the architect H. G. Quartermain, was more concerned with developing what was to be Merton Park, an early garden suburb centred on the old village, around the church of St Mary the Virgin. Quartermain built houses there between the early 1870s and 1904 (these are described by B. Cherry and N. Pevsner in <span class="italic">The Buildings of England, London 2, South</span>). The estate did not extend as far as planned during Innes's lifetime, but he achieved his aim of wide avenues of trees and holly hedges, houses for City men, cottages for farm and estate workers, a boys' club, a men's club, and a masonic hall. Lower Merton railway station was renamed Merton Park.<br>
<br>About 1872 Innes became lord of the manor of Merton. He was a JP, a churchwarden, and an overseer and guardian. He represented Merton on Croydon rural district council, and he was a trustee of the Merton schools and a manager of Abbey Road School. He purchased Bay Tree, a house on Kingston Road, to establish a place of temperance, and he considered the welfare of his estate workers and their widows; he also provided land for allotments and accommodated sports and f&ecirc;tes in his gardens. He farmed pigs, sheep, and a dairy herd, in Merton, Morden, and Hedgerley, Berkshire. As chairman of the trustees of the Rutlish Charity, to finance the apprenticeship of poor children of Merton he was closely involved when Rutlish Science School opened in 1895 to the east of the railway; he became chairman of its management board. As Rutlish School it later came to include Innes's original grounds, incorporating the building that was once his house.<br>
<br>John Innes died suddenly on 8 August 1904 at his home, Manor House, Merton, after a brief illness of uncertain cause. He was buried at Merton Park, Surrey, on 12 August at St Mary's Church, where four Burne-Jones windows, made in stained glass at Morris &amp; Co. of Merton Abbey, were erected in his memory. An obituary on 13 August 1904 in the <span class="italic">Wimbledon News</span> described him as &#145;somewhat stern in demeanour&#146;, but generous, &#145;his purse always open for the furtherance of any good object&#146;; and &#145;an all-round patron of all the social work of the parish&#146;.<br>
<br>In his will Innes bequeathed his house and 5 acres of land for the establishment of a &#145;school of horticulture&#146; with workshops, tools, scientific apparatus, libraries, and lecture and exhibition halls. The remainder of his estate was intended for a public park; later the John Innes Park came into being. The John Innes Horticultural Institution was founded in Merton Park in 1910, and was the earliest research institute for plant breeding and genetics in the UK. It later moved to Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire, where, in 1960, it became the John Innes Institute. In 1967 it transferred to Colney, near Norwich. It is now part of the John Innes Centre which is of international repute. The famous &#145;John Innes&#146; compost was named after him.<br>
