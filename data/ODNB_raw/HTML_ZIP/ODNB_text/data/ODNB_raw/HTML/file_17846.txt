<span class="headword">Major,  Richard Henry</span>  (1818&#150;1891), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 3 October 1818 at 38 Old Street (Road), Shoreditch, London, son of Richard Henry Major, surgeon, of an old Jersey family, and Elizabeth Edge, who married in 1816. After her husband's death on 7 January 1822 Elizabeth remarried, leaving Richard and his elder brother to the care of their paternal grandfather. After attending Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1832 to 1836, Richard was destined for the church, but instead spent the next six years as clerk to a German and then a Spanish merchant's firm in London. He did not regret his decision not to enter the church, although he forwent a considerable legacy thereby and remained interested in religion throughout his life. He became supernumerary assistant at the British Museum in 1844 under the patronage of Sir Henry Ellis. He was also introduced by Ellis to the recently formed Hakluyt Society, where he was honorary secretary, officially between 1849 and 1858 and unofficially for considerable periods after this. His linguistic and historical skills led to his editing eight volumes of travellers' accounts for the society and he also materially helped editors of other volumes.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1847 Major married Sarah Elizabeth Thorn (<i>c</i>.1814&#150;1890), artist, and for twelve years lived with her at 4 Albion Place, Canonbury Square, Islington, London, the house of her parents, Henry (hosier and merino manufacturer) and Elizabeth Thorn. They had two daughters. Sarah&#151;who worked professionally as both Thorn and Major&#151;skilfully illustrated some of her husband's publications. Major continued to work at the British Museum, although, with money inherited from his grandfather and father-in-law, he had a comfortable private income. In 1854 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and was active in it for the next twenty years. Elected fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1845, he was honorary secretary from 1866 to 1881 and vice-president between 1881 and 1884. In 1861 he was made knight of the Tower and the Sword by Pedro V of Portugal for his claim that the Portuguese discovered Australia in the sixteenth century. Luiz I made him officer of the same order after the publication of <span class="italic">The Life of Prince Henry of Portugal, Surnamed the Navigator</span> (1868) and later made him knight commander of the order of Santiago. In 1873 Dom Pedro II of Brazil made him knight commander of the Rose of Brazil. In 1874 Victor Emmanuel II made him knight commander of the Crown of Italy for his <span class="italic">Voyages of the Venetian Brothers N. and A. Zeno</span> (1873). He was appointed keeper of the newly created department of maps and charts in the British Museum in 1867. Respiratory illness forced him to retire from the museum in 1880 and from active involvement in professional societies shortly afterwards. He died on 25 June 1891 at his home, 51 Holland Road, Kensington, London, and was buried two days later in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Major was the leading figure of his day in Britain in the history of cartography and discoveries, particularly of America and Australia, and, although subsequent scholarship has forced revision of many of his opinions, he is still recognized as having been a pioneer in his field, with his unique access to the British Museum collections and a considerable say in influential publications.<br>
