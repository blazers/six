<span class="headword">Lockier,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1669, <em>d.</em> 1740), <span class="occ">dean of Peterborough</span>, son of William and Hannah Lockier of Norwich, was born there and baptized at St Mary-in-the-Marsh, Norwich, on 25 March 1669. He was educated at the city grammar school under John Burton, and on 9 May 1683 was admitted subsizar of Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in January 1687, MA in 1690, and DD in 1717, on the occasion of the visit of George I. On his first trip to London he &#145;thrust himself&#146; into Will's to see the wits, and on his second visit to the coffee house contrived by a timely illustration to ingratiate himself with Dryden, whose friendship he retained throughout life  (Malone, 1.478&#150;9).<br>
<br>Lockier accompanied Sir Paul Rycaut to the Hanse towns, and acted as chaplain and secretary to Lord Molesworth while he was in the Low Countries. For some years Lockier was chaplain to the English factory at Hamburg, and made an annual journey to Hanover to cultivate the acquaintance of George I. He mixed much in the world, was a good judge of character, knew the chief continental languages, and was brimful of anecdote. On the nomination of the archbishop of York, to whom the benefice had lapsed, he held (1693&#150;1740) the valuable rectory of Handsworth, near Sheffield, and for nine years (1731&#150;40) he was, by the gift of the earl of Holdernesse, rector of the adjoining parish of Aston. Through the personal favour of George I, to whom he was chaplain-in-ordinary, Lockier was appointed in March 1725 to the deanery of Peterborough, and he retained all his preferments until his death. When unable to reside regularly at Handsworth he engaged the services of a clerk in orders. He made some provision for the education of the poor in Handsworth, and while he was dean &pound;600 was expended from the chapter revenues in removing the Benedictine arrangement, which extended two bays into the nave, and in fitting up the eastern section of the church as the ritual choir, leaving the lantern and transepts outside it. A further sum of &pound;500 was spent on extensive repairs to the organ.<br>
<br>From 21 July 1726 Lockier was a member of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding, and he communicated an account of Sir Isaac Newton to this antiquarian society, which was later printed in Nichols's <span class="italic">Literary Anecdotes</span> (1812&#150;15, 6.101&#150;2), and in Nichols's <span class="italic">Illustrations of Literature</span> (1817&#150;58, 4.17&#150;18). His only publication was a sermon before the House of Commons on 31 January 1726. A rhyming account of the contemporary clergymen around Sheffield speaks of him as &#145;debonaire and civil, well read, and made complete by travel&#146;.<br>
<br>Lockier died in Peterborough on 17 July 1740 and was buried in the cathedral, where a tablet at the entry from the south choir aisle into the eastern chapel was erected. He bequeathed to Bishop Zachary Pearce his excellent library, except such books as the bishop already owned, which were given to the chapter library at Peterborough. He left a manuscript book of anecdotes which was burnt in accordance with his will, but several of his reminiscences of his friends Dryden and Pope were published in Joseph Spence's <span class="italic">Anecdotes, Observations, and Characters, of Books and Men</span> (1820, 58 ff.).<br>
