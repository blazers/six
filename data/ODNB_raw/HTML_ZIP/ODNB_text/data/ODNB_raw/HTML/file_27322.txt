<span class="headword">Thomson,  Robert Dundas</span>  (1810&#150;1864), <span class="occ">medical officer of health</span>, one of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27309/', "James Thomson (1768&#150;1855)")</script>, minister of Eccles, Berwickshire, and editor of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of James Skene of Aberdeen, was born at Eccles manse on 21 September 1810. He was educated for the medical profession in Edinburgh and Glasgow. In Glasgow he studied chemistry under his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27325/', "Thomas Thomson (1773&#150;1852)")</script>, then professor there, and in 1840 he studied at Giessen under J. Von Liebig. He graduated MD and CM at Glasgow University in 1831, and became a member of the Royal College of Physicians, in London, in 1859. After making a voyage to India and China as assistant surgeon in the service of the East India Company, he settled as a physician in London about 1835, and took an active part in the establishment of the Blenheim Street school of medicine. About this time he married his first cousin, Margaret Agnes, the daughter of Thomas Thomson.<br>
<br>Early in his career Thomson investigated a variety of physiological questions&#151;including the composition of the blood, especially in cholera&#151;and he soon made himself a reputation as an acute observer. He was employed by the government to make a series of experiments on cattle food and to analyse the water supplied by the different London companies. His researches on the constituents of food in relation to the systems of animals was published as <span class="italic">Experimental Researches on the Food of Animals</span> (1846); this work became a standard source of reference for physiologists pursuing similar inquiries, and it was influential in later nineteenth-century dietary debates.<br>
<br>In 1841 Thomson went to Glasgow as deputy professor and assistant to his uncle, the professor of chemistry, who was ill. Thomson's lectures were heavy and hesitating, his experiments slow, and his matter too profound for the students. He was unsuccessful as a candidate for the chair at his uncle's death in 1852, but after returning to London he was appointed lecturer on chemistry at St Thomas's Hospital, on the retirement of Dr Leeson. This post he held for some years. In 1856, when medical officers of health were appointed under the <span class="roman">Metropolitan Local Management Act</span>, he was the successful candidate for Marylebone. Thomson enthusiastically set about organizing a system of inspection in Marylebone, and upon the formation of the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health he became the association's first president. He became widely known as an authority on sanitary matters, and he was employed by the registrar-general to make a monthly report of the amount of impurity in the waters of the different London companies.<br>
<br>Thomson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 1 June 1854 and was also a president of the British Meteorological Society. He lived in London at 41 York Terrace, Regent's Park, and died at his brother's residence, Dunstable House, Richmond, Surrey, on 17 August 1864; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>Thomson contributed numerous papers to the British and foreign medical and scientific journals. He also published nine books on subjects as diverse as school chemistry, diet, the effects of alcohol on health, and cholera.<br>
