<span class="headword">Day,  Francis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1605&#150;1666<span class="mult">x</span>73), <span class="occ">founder of Madras</span>, was the fourth son of William Day (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1628) of Bray, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Helen (<i>d</i>. 1630/31), daughter of Paul Wentworth of Burnham, Buckinghamshire; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7373/', "William Day (1529&#150;1596)")</script>, bishop of Winchester, was his grandfather. He probably attended Eton College, where his grandfather had been provost, between 1618 and 1620. During the 1620s he may have learned the clothworker's trade in London under Peter Miles, freeman of the Clothworkers' Company from 1622, though there is no record of his having been apprenticed or made free of the company himself. On 5 July 1630 he obtained a licence to marry Elizabeth Matson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1609), daughter of Robert Matson, yeoman, of Satwell, Berkshire; both were described as living in the parish of St James Garlickhithe, but the marriage was to take place at the parish church of Chelsea, Middlesex. In 1632 Day was appointed a factor by the East India Company, and in 1634 chief of the factory (trading station) at Armagon, a small port on the Coromandel coast of eastern India. The Coromandel coast was important to the European trading companies because it was there that they could purchase Indian textiles, notably chintz, a kind of &#145;painted&#146; cloth made nowhere else and which was highly sought after in Europe. Diamonds, commonly used as a means of remitting money to Europe, were also available from nearby Golconda. Owing to the dilapidated state of the Armagon factory, its impoverished trading hinterland, and oppression by both the local Indian ruler and the Dutch at Pulicat, Day contemplated the establishment of a new factory to the south. In 1637 he made an exploratory voyage from Masulipatam to Pondicherry, and in 1639 he again sailed south. On 23 July of that year he arrived at the coastal village of Madrasipatam, just south of the village of Chinnapatnam and north of the Portuguese settlement of San Thom&eacute;. Discovering the area to be a good source of textiles, he negotiated the grant of a plot of coastal land on behalf of the company from Damarla Venkatadri, the local ruler. In February 1640 Armagon was dismantled, and on 20 February the establishment arrived at Madras, where work soon began on building a new fort, later named Fort St George. For this construction Day took on loans on his own account. Finding the financial burden excessive, in August 1640 he proceeded to Surat to plead his case with the governing council, who, although freeing him of the responsibility, dispatched him to England in December 1640 to answer certain charges relating to private trading. Apparently exonerated by the company, Day was admitted a freeman of the company by service on 22 October 1641, and re-employed as a merchant for a voyage on the <i>Hopewell</i>, commanded by captain Andrew Trumbull, to Madras and Persia, underwriting the voyage himself with &pound;500, but his request for private trade to the value of &pound;100 was refused. He sailed accompanied by his son, also Francis, and the ship arrived at Madras on 5 July 1642, before proceeding to Balasore. At the end of 1642 he was again at Fort St George, sitting as second on council, before continuing to Persia. In mid-1643 Day and others charged Trumbull with violence and tyranny. In vituperative response, Trumbull accused Day of habitual drunkenness, of stealing a Danish captain's wife and two waiting gentlewomen, and of gaming and illicit private trading. However, Trumbull was dismissed and his allegations remain uncorroborated.<br>
<br>On 27 August 1643 Day took over as chief of Fort St George from Andrew Cogan, but immediately applied to the company to be relieved of the responsibility. He was superseded by Thomas Ivie on 4 August 1644, and on 7 September sailed for Bantam. His subsequent career remains obscure. In 1646, in England, he was fined by the company for private trading, and in 1652 he gave evidence in a case before the court of committee. He was mayor of Wallingford, Berkshire, in 1665&#150;6, when he made a statement about the town for the visitation. He made his will in November 1666, when he was described as a gentleman of Great Haseley, Oxfordshire, and owned property in Wallingford, Wargrave, and Kilham, Berkshire. He had died by August 1673, when his will was proved.<br>
