</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Onslow,  William Hillier</span>, fourth earl of Onslow  (1853&#150;1911), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, was born at Alresford, Hampshire, on 7 March 1853, the only child of George Augustus Cranley Onslow (1813&#150;13 April 1855) of Alresford, Hampshire, who was the nephew of Arthur George, third earl, and grandson of Thomas, second earl. The mother of the fourth earl was Mary Harriet Ann, eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General William Fraser Bentinck Loftus of Kilbride, co. Wicklow, Ireland; she died on 7 November 1880. William Hillier Onslow succeeded his great-uncle as fourth earl in October 1870, and thus, at the age of seventeen, inherited an estate of 13,488 acres (worth nearly &pound;11,000 p.a.), chiefly in Surrey and Essex. He was educated at Eton College, and entered Exeter College, Oxford, in 1871 but left after a year without taking a degree. On 3 February 1875 he married the Hon. Florence Coulston Gardner, elder daughter of Alan Legge, third Baron Gardner; she died on 8 August 1934.<br>
<br>While still in his mid-twenties, Onslow was appointed a lord-in-waiting in February 1880 in Lord Beaconsfield's Conservative administration, holding office until the government was dissolved two months later; he represented the Local Government Board in the House of Lords. He held no office in the brief tory government of 1885&#150;6, but was again appointed a lord-in-waiting after Salisbury's sweeping win at the 1886 election, holding office from 5 August 1886 until 21 February 1887. He then held the positions of parliamentary under-secretary of state for the colonies (from 16 February 1887 until 20 February 1888) and parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade (from 21 February 1888 until 1 January 1889). While at the former office, in April 1887, Onslow served as vice-president of the first Colonial Conference and was a delegate to the Sugar Bounties Conference in 1887&#150;8.<br>
<br>In November 1888, at the age of only thirty-five, Onslow was appointed governor of New Zealand, assuming office on 2 May 1889 and holding it until 24 February 1892. Historians concur that he was a successful governor, businesslike and frank in character, who was, nevertheless, unpopular and unhappy in his political dealings. When the government of Sir Harry Atkinson was defeated at the polls in December 1890, it recommended to Onslow that he approve several appointments to the legislative council (the appointed upper house). He refused to make more than six and these only on assurance that they were needed to strengthen the chamber and not to reward party services. His decision did not please the incoming government of John Ballance, who protested to the governor against the appointments on the grounds that they were unconstitutional. Onslow's reply was the brusque one that they had already been made and that he was responsible only to the Colonial Office. He was also instrumental in achieving a clarification, throughout the empire, of the responsibility of the governor and ministers in regard to the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. In a particular case, in February 1891, the New Zealand cabinet had asserted its right to advise the governor upon this subject as upon all others. Onslow accepted this advice, but asked that the matter should be made clear in royal instructions. This received the agreement of all other colonies and it was regularized accordingly.<br>
<br>In New Zealand, Onslow took a considerable interest in the Maori people, giving his second son, who was born there, the middle name of &#145;Huia&#146; and presenting him for adoption to the Ngati-Huia tribe in September 1891. He also encouraged acclimatization societies, and established preserves for native New Zealand birds. Nevertheless, he was also regarded as aloof from New Zealand society and became embroiled, at the time of his departure in February 1892, in another quarrel over appointments to the legislative council. On this occasion, in contrast to his previous stance, he refused to sanction the appointment of new nominees to the upper house.<br>
<br>When the Conservatives returned to power in 1895 Onslow again held office, as under-secretary of state for India (5 July 1895&#150;26 November 1901) and under-secretary of state for the colonies (26 November 1900&#150;20 May 1903). He took part in the Colonial Conference of 1902 and served as acting secretary of state during the visit of Joseph Chamberlain, the colonial secretary, to South Africa. On 20 May 1903 he at last obtained cabinet rank, serving as president of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries until 14 March 1905. He was well-suited to appointment to this office, for agriculture and farming in Britain were subjects in which he had long taken a great interest. As secretary of state he set up a number of departmental committees, established a national network of correspondents to inform his department on local conditions, and travelled around Britain's agricultural areas taking an interest in the effect of the railway rates question upon farmers. His responsibilities as secretary were also strengthened by the <span class="roman">Board of Agriculture and Fisheries Act</span> of 1903, which transferred control of the fishery industry from the Board of Trade to his portfolio.<br>
<br>While secretary of state, however, Onslow had become convinced that even the Conservative government took no real interest in agriculture, noting that Arthur Balfour, the prime minister, was &#145;indifferent&#146; to the subject. When the Liberals came to power in December 1905, Onslow became convinced of the extreme &#145;dangers ahead&#146; to the landed interest from the new radical government. He immediately set out to form an active back-bench organization of Unionist peers, which had never existed before. He hired a barrister as secretary and expert adviser to this group and established sub-committees to consider legislation introduced by the Liberal government. Dubbed the Apaches by Lord Lansdowne, this group had seventy-five members by 1910, eventually becoming the Association of Independent and Unionist Peers. Onslow's organization was thus perhaps the first of the &#145;die-hard&#146; tory groups which became so notable a part of the right-wing resistance to the advanced legislation of the Edwardian Liberal government. Onslow held a number of other government posts as well: in 1905 he succeeded Albert Edmund Parker, third earl of Morley, as chairman of committees and deputy speaker of the House of Lords, holding this post until the Easter recess of 1911; he was also chairman of the smallholdings committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1905. For many years he was an advocate of the creation of life peerages to enhance the power of the House of Lords, and also wished them to be awarded to notable colonial figures. Outside government, he was president (in 1905&#150;6) of the Royal Statistical Society and chairman of the Central Land Association.<br>
<br>Onslow also made his mark in local politics, serving as an alderman of the London county council (LCC) (1896) and for a time as leader of the moderate (that is, conservative) party in the LCC. He was also an alderman of the City of Westminster (1900&#150;03). In January 1896, as leader of the LCC's moderates, he led a deputation of vestrymen to see the chancellor of the exchequer to plead for a fairer distribution of exchequer grants&#151;part of Onslow's long-standing concern for the unfair burden of taxation falling on the landed interest.<br>
<br>Although Onslow was forced to sell much of his Surrey land in 1905, he was happiest in agricultural pursuits and as a country gentleman at his home at Clandon Park, near Guildford, Surrey. A bearded, balding man in mature life, he served as high steward of Guildford and was a deputy lieutenant of Surrey. Always a keen sportsman, he was a member of the Coaching and Four in Hand Club. He was created a KCMG in 1887, a GCMG in 1889 (on becoming governor of New Zealand), and was sworn of the privy council in 1903. He died on 23 October 1911 at his son's house, Beechworth, Hampstead, and was buried at Merrow near Guildford. He was survived by two sons and two daughters; his eldest son, Richard William Alan, fifth earl of Onslow (1876&#150;1945), held a variety of ministerial offices, including paymaster-general (1928&#150;9), and was chairman of committees in the House of Lords in 1931&#150;44. His elder daughter was MP for Southend under her married name, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33602/', "Gwendolen Guinness, countess of Iveagh")</script>.<br>
