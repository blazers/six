<span class="headword">Webster,  Thomas</span>  (1810&#150;1875), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born in Oakington, Cambridgeshire, on 16 October 1810, the eldest son of Thomas Webster, vicar of Oakington. From Charterhouse he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA as fourteenth wrangler in 1832 and MA in 1835. He was secretary to the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1837 to 1839 and honorary secretary until 1841. In that year he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and joined the northern circuit.<br>
<br>Webster soon acquired a large practice in connection with scientific cases, and for many years was recognized as a leading authority on patent law. His <span class="italic">Reports and Notes of Cases on Letters Patent for Inventions</span> (1844) was for many years the chief textbook on the subject. It was largely due to his efforts that the <span class="roman">Patent Law Amendment Act</span> of 1852 was passed, an act by which numerous abuses that had grown up round the ancient system of granting patents were swept away and the cost of a patent was greatly reduced.<br>
<br>Webster had also a considerable parliamentary practice. He was one of the counsel engaged for Birkenhead in contests respecting the Liverpool and Mersey docks and published two texts which became standard works of reference concerning the Mersey. He was for long an active member of the governing body of the Society of Arts. He was in the chair at the meeting of the society in 1845 when the first proposal was made for holding the Great Exhibition of 1851, and formed one of the first committee appointed to organize it. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1847, and in 1865 he was appointed one of her majesty's counsel.<br>
<br>Webster was twice married: first in 1839 to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1848), eldest daughter of Richard Calthrop of Swineshead Abbey, Lincolnshire; and second to Mary Frances, daughter of Joseph Cookworthy MD of Plymouth. With his first wife he had three sons and two daughters; with his second wife he had one son and one daughter. His second son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36810/', "Richard Everard Webster, first Viscount Alverstone")</script>, Conservative attorney-general and lord chief justice.<br>
<br>Webster died at his London home, 97 Ladbroke Road, Notting Hill, on 3 June 1875.<br>
