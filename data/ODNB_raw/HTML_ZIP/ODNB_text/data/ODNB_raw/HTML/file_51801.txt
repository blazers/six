<span class="headword">Graham,  William</span>  (1817&#150;1885), <span class="occ">collector and art patron</span>, was born on 25 August 1817 in Glasgow, the eldest son of William Graham (1795/6&#150;1855), a merchant of Burnshiels, Renfrewshire, and Catherine, daughter of J. Swanston. He was educated privately and at Glasgow University, and succeeded his father as senior partner in the family business, W. and J. Graham &amp; Co., which imported dry goods from India and port from Portugal. He settled in London in 1866, living at 54 Lowndes Square and then at 44 (renumbered 36 in 1876) Grosvenor Place, and renting houses in Perthshire for the summer.<br>
<br>In 1865 Graham was elected Liberal MP for the city of Glasgow. He spoke mainly on Scottish and religious questions (he was a devout Presbyterian) and advocated moderate parliamentary reform. He was a friend of Gladstone (who appointed him a trustee of the National Gallery in 1884), but was not active politically and stood down with some relief in 1874 because of illness.<br>
<br>Graham was one of the most important art patrons and collectors of the 1860s and 1870s, playing a key role in the careers of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones. His attitude to art was essentially emotional rather than intellectual: he was so taken with one painting by Burne-Jones that he kissed it; he was suspicious of connoisseurs. He may have been encouraged to begin collecting, in the 1860s, by his uncle, John Graham of Skelmorlie, whose fine collection included J. E. Millais's <span class="italic">Sir Isumbras at the Ford</span> (1857; Tate collection). He bought his first Rossetti&#151;<span class="italic">Morning Music</span> (1864; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge)&#151;in 1866, and first met the artist in 1868. He soon became Rossetti's principal patron (rivalled only by F. R. Leyland) and a friend, taking care of the artist in Scotland following his suicide attempt in 1872. Graham preferred Rossetti's early work, owning both <span class="italic">The Girlhood of Mary Virgin</span> (1849) and <span class="italic">Ecce ancilla domini!</span> (1850) (both Tate collection), and expressed reservations about those later paintings inspired by Jane Morris, but would buy whatever the artist wanted to sell him. His principal commission was <span class="italic">Dante's Dream at the Time of the Death of Beatrice</span> (1871; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), which proved too large for its intended position at Grosvenor Place, and had to be replaced by the version now in Dundee Art Gallery. Delays in completing commissions and disagreements about money somewhat soured their friendship in Rossetti's final years, but in 1881 the artist could still call him &#145;a friend who has shown me such marks of brotherly attachment as deserve every consideration from me&#146;  (Rossetti to Graham, September 1881, <span class="italic">Letters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</span>, no. 2552).<br>
<br>Graham enjoyed a calmer and more fruitful relationship with Burne-Jones, who wrote, &#145;I used to think one could use no other word but genius for his perception and instinct for painting. It was infallible. He was never wrong&#146;  (Burne-Jones to Frances Horner, July 1892, FM Cam., Burne-Jones papers, xxvii, 13). Burne-Jones was particularly devoted to Graham's daughter Frances, one of eight children from his marriage to Jane Catherine Loundes (1819/20&#150;1899) of Arthurlie, Renfrewshire, on 1 January 1845. Graham owned both the watercolour and oil versions of <span class="italic">Laus Veneris</span> (watercolour, 1861; priv. coll.; oil, 1873&#150;5, 1878; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle) and <span class="italic">Chant d'amour</span> (watercolour, 1865; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; oil, 1868&#150;73; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), favouring the warm Venetian colouring of the latter. In the 1880s Graham acted as Burne-Jones's agent, negotiating the sales of <span class="italic">King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid</span> (1880&#150;84; Tate collection) to Lord Wharncliffe and of the large <span class="italic">Briar Rose</span> cycle (1874&#150;90; Buscot Park, Oxfordshire) to Agnews.<br>
<br>Graham owned major paintings by J. E. Millais, W. Holman Hunt, Lord Leighton, G. F. Watts, Fred Walker, and Arthur Hughes. He also bought old masters for smaller sums, but in even greater quantities. Encouraged by Rossetti and Burne-Jones, he concentrated on acquiring paintings produced in central and northern Italy during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. They included Antonello's <span class="italic">Virgin and Child</span>, Dosso Dossi's <span class="italic">Circe and her Lovers</span> (both National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), Pesellino's <span class="italic">Virgin and Child with St John</span> (Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio), and Piero di Cosimo's <span class="italic">The Discovery of Vulcan</span> (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut).<br>
<br>From the late 1870s Graham collected less, because of ill health, financial constraints, and the tragic deaths of his two sons, Rutherford and Willy. Burne-Jones's chalk portrait of 1880 (priv. coll.) bleakly depicted the physical consequences of these events. According to Georgiana Burne-Jones, &#145;His face was that of a saint, and at times like one transfigured&#146;  (Burne-Jones, 1.296), and indeed he came to resemble Jacopo Bellini's <span class="italic">San Bernardino of Siena</span> (priv. coll.), in his own collection.<br>
<br>Graham died of stomach cancer on 16 July 1885, while staying with his daughter Agnes Jekyll [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52023/', "Jekyll, Dame Agnes")</script>] at Oakdene near Guildford in Surrey, and was buried in the necropolis of St Mungo's Cathedral, Glasgow, together with several small paintings by Burne-Jones. The bulk of his collection was sold at Christies in London on 2&#150;3 and 8&#150;10 April 1886, realizing &pound;69,168. Today it is best represented in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.<br>
