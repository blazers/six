<span class="headword">Mascall,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1416), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, is said by the sixteenth-century bibliographer John Bale to have been born in Ludlow. He became a Carmelite, and is also said to have been prior of the friary at Ludlow, where he probably received some schooling as a boy. He refers in his will to his only known kinsman, one John Gase. His family background appears to have been undistinguished. He had received the degree of DTh from Oxford University by 3 October 1393, when he took part in the trial of the suspected Lollard Walter Bryt (also recorded as Brut and Bryte) at Hereford. He preached before Richard II at Candlemas 1396. But the fact that he became confessor to Henry IV as soon as that king seized the throne points to a gap in the known details of Mascall's career. There is no evidence that he had shared Henry Bolingbroke's exile, but, as his title of duke of Hereford indicates, Henry had considerable interests in the west midlands and Welsh march, much of it through his late wife, Mary de Bohun, and may have encountered Mascall accordingly. On 24 December 1400 Mascall was granted the temporalities of the vacant see of Meath in Ireland, being licensed on 22 and 25 January 1401 to stay in England and collect the revenues (for what they were worth) by attorney. On 13 February he was referred to as &#145;elect&#146; of Meath and dispensed to hold the church of Kildalke in Ireland to augment the revenue. However, in 1402 Robert Montain was provided to the see, and Mascall's remuneration at court readjusted.<br>
<br>Mascall remained in constant attendance on the king until his dismissal was demanded and ceded, for no specific reason, in the parliament of January 1404, the latest in a line of unpopular royal confessors of unpopular kings. It happened that the see of Hereford fell vacant on 29 March, for which Mascall might well have been an obvious candidate anyway. Adam Usk, not the most reliable of autobiographers, would claim later that he himself was nominated by the pope, and it is true that Mascall travelled to Rome in person to secure provision on 2 July and consecration there four days later; but this journey may have been in part a dignified withdrawal from his detractors at home. In August or early September 1404, returning from Middleburg in Zeeland to England, he was captured by Flemish pirates and detained at Dunkirk with at least the tacit consent of the duchess of Burgundy, but released, if maybe for a ransom, before 25 September. On 20 March 1406 he received &pound;10 from the crown for his losses during Owain Glyn D&#373;r's rebellion. He attended parliaments regularly, but otherwise was fully resident in his diocese. Bale refers to Mascall as a noted preacher and of upright character, although, in the absence of any explicit slur on him and given his career, Bale might simply have been settling for the obvious. Mascall made a perfunctory will on 23 November 1416 in London, with a codicil on 16 December. He died on 22 December 1416, in London, and was probably buried, as he requested, in the Carmelite church at Ludlow, which he had reputedly rebuilt in large part, although a series of antiquarians have preferred to believe he was buried at the London house. Bale attributes a number of writings to him, including a collection of sermons preached before the king, but none of them is known to survive.<br>
