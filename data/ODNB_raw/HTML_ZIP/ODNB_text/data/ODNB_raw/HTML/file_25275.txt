<span class="headword">Lefevre, Sir  John George  Shaw-</span>  (1797&#150;1879), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at 11 Bedford Square, London, on 24 January 1797, the second of four sons of Charles Shaw (1758&#150;1823), and his wife, Helena (1767&#150;1834), daughter and heiress of John Lefevre of Heckfield Place, Hampshire. Charles Shaw, who assumed the additional name of Lefevre on his marriage into that Huguenot family, sat as an MP from 1792 to 1820. John was educated at Dr Faithfull's school at Warfield, and then at Eton College, before entering in 1814 Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a close friend of Denis Le Marchant. He graduated BA as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman in 1818, proceeding MA in 1821, having been elected a fellow of Trinity in 1819. He went out of residence, travelling in France and Italy, where he studied Italian and modern Greek and established the foundations of his later facility in languages. He entered at the Inner Temple in 1822, and was called to the bar in 1825. He married in 1824 Rachel Emily (1801&#150;1885), daughter of Ichabod Wright, a Nottingham banker, with whom he had a family of two sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>On settling in London during the 1820s Shaw-Lefevre moved in intellectual whiggish circles. Through his father he gained election as FRS in 1820, and in the following year he was elected one of the founder members of the Political Economy Club, remaining a member until 1831. From 1828 until 1846 he was a member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, promoted by Lord Brougham. At the same time he developed a successful legal practice as a conveyancer, handling from 1826 the land dealings of the earls Spencer. The Spencer connection led to his appointment by Lord Grey's government in November 1831 to redraw county constituency boundaries in readiness for the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832. His success in carrying out this sensitive assignment raised his political prospects and, standing as a whig, he was elected for Petersfield in December 1832, but early in 1833 he was unseated on petition. In April 1833, on Althorp's recommendation, Lord Stanley appointed him under-secretary for the colonies, where he had particular responsibility for distributing the &pound;20 million compensation to slave owners in the West Indies provided for under the <span class="roman">Emancipation Act</span>. Althorp's influence led to his appointment in August 1834, together with Frankland Lewis and George Nicholls, as one of three commissioners responsible for implementing the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span>. This involved both a heavy administrative burden and much public obloquy.<br>
<br>Shaw-Lefevre found the strain of the poor-law commission overwhelming and was happy to transfer, in June 1841, to the vacant joint secretaryship of the Board of Trade, responsible mainly for the legal business falling on the department and especially the regulation of joint-stock companies. He represented the Board of Trade on the council of government schools of design, and became embroiled in the heated arguments as to how best government might encourage industrial design. He retained political ambitions, and in July 1847 was brought forward by a committee chaired by Sir Edward Ryan, and including Babbage, Brougham, and Macaulay, to stand as a reforming candidate for the Cambridge University parliamentary seat. He finished at the foot of the poll. In June 1848 he was able to leave the busy departmental work at the Board of Trade when Lord John Russell appointed him to the more leisurely position of deputy clerk to the parliaments (where his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25274/', "Charles Shaw-Lefevre, later Viscount Eversley")</script>, was speaker), and succeeded Sir George Henry Rose in 1855 as clerk of the parliaments. He held the clerkship until his retirement in March 1875. During his period of office he prepared an analysis of the standing orders of the House of Lords, achieved a more orderly publication of statutes, and helped the work of the Historical Manuscripts Commission.<br>
<br>Shaw-Lefevre's services were in constant demand for various commissions, inquiries, and other public work. He was an unsalaried charity commissioner (1835&#150;7) and a member of the colonization commission for South Australia (1835&#150;40), chaired by Robert Torrens. After that commission was revoked he became an unpaid colonial land and emigration commissioner (1841&#150;6). In 1836 he was appointed one of the original thirty-eight members of the senate of the University of London, which received its charter as an examining and degree-awarding body in that year, serving as vice-chancellor from 1842. His mathematical training qualified him for membership of the commission appointed in 1838 to consider replacements for the official standards of weights and measures destroyed by fire in the houses of parliament. In 1842 he served on a Treasury committee to investigate frauds connected with the issue of exchequer bills. He was an unpaid member of the British Museum commission (1847&#150;50) and the ecclesiastical commission (from 1847). In 1847 he was called upon to settle the row between the Royal Scottish Academy, the Edinburgh Royal Institute, and the Board of Manufactures regarding support for art and the training of artists in Scotland. His recommendations to the Treasury led to the scheme for a national gallery in Scotland. He also reported to the Treasury on the Scottish Fishery Board (1848) and reviewed the unpopular annuity tax, levied to pay the stipends of the Scottish clergy (1849).<br>
<br>Serving as an unsalaried member of the episcopal and capitular revenues commission (1849&#150;50), Shaw-Lefevre was made an unpaid member of the church estates commission, created to oversee the management of the Church of England's property. On both commissions he was the whig government's nominee charged with protecting the interests of lay tenants of the church's lands. Later in 1850 he was appointed to investigate the affairs of the New Zealand Company. He was one of the five members of Macaulay's committee of 1853 which drew up the famous scheme for open competitive recruitment to the civil service of the East India Company, and he served on the inns of court commission (1854&#150;5) which investigated legal education. In 1855 he was appointed one of the civil service commissioners, charged with organizing the examinations for posts in the home civil service which replaced the old patronage system. All these were unpaid, and he was extremely scrupulous about not taking on additional remunerative employments when receiving an official salary; the traditional stipend of &pound;20 and a butt of ale for undertaking the auditorship of Trinity College was the only emolument he had received in addition to his income as poor law commissioner. He looked instead for honorary recognition, which was slow in coming. He was appointed CB in April 1848 and knighted (KCB) on Palmerston's recommendation in January 1857, but only after he had felt obliged to distribute a printed memorandum of his official services.<br>
<br>In 1858 Shaw-Lefevre gave up his position as church estates commissioner, and early in 1862 poor health caused him to stand down from the civil service commission and the vice-chancellorship of London University. His final unsalaried services were as a member of the digest of laws (1867&#150;70) and standards of weights and measures (1867&#150;8) commissions, and as one of the commissioners responsible for redrafting the statutes of the ancient public schools (1868) following the report of the Clarendon commission. In 1871 he presided over the education section of the Social Science Association congress at Dublin. Oxford University conferred the degree of honorary DCL upon him in 1858. He continued to learn languages late in life, taking up Russian when he was sixty-five. In 1873 he translated and published <span class="italic">The Burgomaster's Family</span> from the Dutch. Shaw-Lefevre died at Cliftonville, Margate, Kent, on 20 August 1879.<br>
<br>Shaw-Lefevre was one of the generation of administrators who, following the passage of parliamentary reform in 1832, carried through the whig programme of renovating British institutions. He was assiduous and conscientious, with a remarkable capacity for assimilating knowledge. His official life was largely behind the scenes, and contemporaries noted that he never overcame the timidity which deterred him from positions exposing him to public criticism  (Willson, 226). He belonged to a dynasty active in public life: among his children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36055/', "George John Shaw-Lefevre, Baron Eversley")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48463/', "Madeleine Septimia Shaw-Lefevre")</script>. His second daughter, Rachel Emily, married Arthur Hamilton Gordon, Baron Stanmore.<br>
