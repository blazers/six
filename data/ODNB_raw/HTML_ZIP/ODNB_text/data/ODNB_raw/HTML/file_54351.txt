<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deakin,  John</span>  (1912&#150;1972), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on the Wirral peninsula at 64 Beaconsfield Road, Lower Bebington, Cheshire, on 8 May 1912, the elder son of John Henry Deakin, a factory checker and later machine minder for Lever Brothers at nearby Port Sunlight, and his wife, Elsie Mary Bond. In 1923 he entered Calday Grange grammar school, West Kirby, where he excelled at swimming and diving, and remained there until 1928. About 1930 he left the Wirral for Ireland and in Dublin took various jobs, including one as a window dresser for a display company. He travelled to Spain to paint its landscape, but returned to Britain in the early 1930s and settled in London. An introduction to Arthur Jeffress, a wealthy American art collector (and later gallery owner), ensured that, as his companion, he could travel the world and paint. He exhibited at the Mayor Gallery, London, during November 1933 to some critical acclaim.<br>
<br>Deakin first picked up a camera in Paris in 1939&#151;it had been left behind in an apartment after a party&#151;and exposed a few frames. &#145;It was a cheap camera and he'd never taken a picture before&#146;, wrote his friend, the poet Elizabeth Smart, &#145;but his tyrannical eyes took over&#146;  (Smart). He took photographs for a living for the next two decades before abandoning it in favour of painting again. His most prolific years&#151;and probably his most creative&#151;were spent as a staff photographer for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> magazine in the mid-1950s. He enjoyed two periods under contract to the magazine and remains the only photographer in its history to be hired and fired twice by the same editor.<br>
<br>Deakin shot mostly portraits, though he was also obliged to shoot fashion (at which he proved to be mediocre). His subjects were the writers, artists, poets, actors, and popular entertainers of the early post-war years: among them David Lean, John Huston, Yves Montand, Pablo Picasso, Maria Callas, and Dylan Thomas. His best portraits, however, were those of his friends, most of whom inhabited the pubs and clubs of Soho, London's bohemian quarter, the lure of which, in time, led him away from <span class="italic">Vogue</span>; the Colony Room in Dean Street was a favourite haunt of his until he was barred. These sitters included the painters John Minton and Francis Bacon and the &#145;two Roberts&#146;, Colquhoun and MacBryde, the poets W. S. Graham and Paul Potts, and the formidable proprietor of the Colony Room, Muriel Belcher. His photographs&#151;typically tightly cropped head shots often greater than life-size&#151;made no concessions to vanity: after pushing the contrast in his prints to its maximum, every pore and blemish was exposed in intimate close-up. His friend Daniel Farson described them as &#145;prison mugshots taken by a real artist&#146;  (Bernard and Noble, 12), and they were frequently found to be too unflattering for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> to publish. The frontality of his composition and his very lack of &#145;style&#146; set him apart from his contemporaries and anticipated by at least ten years the fashionable starkness of the portraiture of Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus.<br>
<br>A substantial part of Deakin's <i>&#339;uvre</i> was recovered from the floor of Francis Bacon's studio. Dog-eared and splattered with paint, these were portraits of subjects Bacon himself wished to depict; he commissioned from Deakin photographs of Henrietta Moraes, Isabel Rawsthorne, and George Dyer, among others, as <i>aides-m&eacute;moires</i>, since he was unwilling to paint their likenesses from life.<br>
<br>Before giving up photography in the 1960s, Deakin had completed a book of photographs, <span class="italic">London Today</span> (1949), and the plate section to Christopher Kininmonth's <span class="italic">Rome Alive</span> (1951). He had also contributed to <span class="italic">Who Only England Know</span> (1943) by John Pudney, a book about Malta (where Deakin spent much of the war years as a sergeant in the army film and photography unit), and completed sample pages for a book on a steelworks and tyre factory in Genoa and one on Paris, which developed out of an exhibition held at David Archer's bookshop in Soho. He had written the text and completed the photographs for an unpublished book, &#145;Eight Portraits&#146;. In addition, he had photographed examples of children's street art and urban graffiti for two uncompleted projects, &#145;London Walls&#146; and &#145;Paris Walls&#146;. A confirmed bachelor, he married in Milan in 1961 not for love but for convenience. In return for citizenship papers, Anna, a stateless Hungarian refugee, financed a replacement for a misplaced Rolleiflex camera.<br>
<br>After his death from heart failure on 25 May 1972 at the Old Ship Hotel, Brighton, Deakin's life's work was retrieved from under his bed in Soho by Bruce Bernard, who later curated a small show of his work, &#145;John Deakin: the salvage of a photographer&#146;, at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1984. At a larger exhibition, &#145;John Deakin photographs&#146;, at the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 1996, many of his rediscovered pictures for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> were shown and, for the first time, the photographs from the floor of Bacon's studio. He was the subject of a television documentary, <span class="italic">The Salvage of a Soho Photographer</span> (1991), and appears as a character in the film <span class="italic">Love is the Devil</span> (1997), played by the actor Karl Johnson. Deakin was also the subject of several character sketches in contemporary fiction, notably Colin Wilson's <span class="italic">Ritual in the Dark</span> (1960) and Elaine Dundy's <span class="italic">The Old Man and Me</span> (1964), mostly vitriolic portrayals, for when drunk he was a monster. Barbara Hutton, the Woolworths' heir, called him the &#145;second nastiest little man she had met in forty years&#146;  (Farson, <span class="italic">Sacred Monsters</span>, 63), but to his peers he was a true original, his professionalism behind the lens, for the most part, unimpeachable.<br>
