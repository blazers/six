<span class="headword">Ferris,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1561?, <em>d.</em> 1613?), <span class="occ">oarsman</span>, was a native of Westminster. An infant of his name was baptized at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 26 October 1561, the son of another Richard Ferris, who had married Agnes Goodlad there on 22 April 1554. The elder Richard was probably &#145;the aged&#146; father still living in Westminster to whom his son referred in 1590. By February 1586 Ferris was employed as one of five messengers to the queen, probably owing his position to the vice-chamberlain, Sir Thomas Heneage, to whom he later dedicated his book. On 28 August 1586 a Richard Ferris was married, also at St Margaret's Westminster, to Thomasine Stranger, a widow. The couple did not baptize any children in the parish church, and Thomasine died young; she was buried on 5 July 1592.<br>
<br>By this time Ferris had rowed in an open boat from London to Bristol. He does not relate why he set out upon his hazardous enterprise, revealing only that it occasioned &#145;the ill will of sundry my good friends, but especially full sore against my aged fathers consent&#146;. He set out from Tower Wharf on 21 June 1590, in a wherry, an open boat, captained by one William Thomas, &#145;a man of sufficient will and approved experience&#146;  (Ferris, sig. A3r), indispensable since Ferris himself &#145;was never trayned up on the water&#146;  (ibid., preface). Also on board was at least one other person, Andrew Hill, whose share of the rowing was certainly greater than his share of the glory. A flotilla of friends and onlookers escorted the three adventurers as far as Greenwich, where they were entertained at the court.<br>
<br>The early part of their voyage passed off without serious incident. They put in at Margate and Dover before encountering and surviving a violent storm off Portsmouth. At Dartmouth they rested for two days, but soon after venturing onwards, &#145;the wind rose &hellip; we were in such an extremity, that we had like to have been drowned, yet it pleased God so far to work for us, that we escaped&#146;  (Ferris, sig. A4<i>r</i>). At the Lizard, &#145;a place well known to be most dangerous and full of rocks and rases &hellip; we passed in the current of the tide with great swiftnesss but with wonderful danger&#146;  (ibid., sig. A4<i>v</i>). Off Land's End the chance discovery of a safe but narrow channel enabled the seafarers to avoid the attentions of a pirate ship. Soon afterwards they found themselves weatherbound for over a fortnight, but were accommodated during this time at &#145;Bottrick&#146; (perhaps Botreaux) Castle by a Mr Pynder. Here as elsewhere, the warmth of their reception seems to have increased noticeably once Ferris reported (as he unfailingly did) his position as messenger to Queen Elizabeth. At length, late on Saturday 1 August, they arrived at Ilfracombe. By this time Ferris was impatient to complete the voyage and insisted, against his captain's advice, upon sailing the same night. Thomas was proved right, for the weather worsened dangerously, and Ferris recalled that &#145;I myself was constrained to row four hours alone on the larboard side, and my fellow rower was compelled to lade forth water so fast as it came into the boat&#146;  (ibid., sig. B<i>v</i>). The following day &#145;great multitudes&#146; turned out to watch as they sailed up the Avon to Bristol. Here<blockquote>the people of the city gathered themselves together, and had prepared trumpets, drummes, fyfes, and ensignes to go before the boate, which was carried upon mens shoulders round about the city &hellip; Afterwards we were had to master Mayors, to the Aldermen and sheriffs houses, where we were feasted most royally and spared for no cost.</blockquote>Ferris and his companions arrived back in London on 8 August 1590 where &#145;our entertainment at our coming was great and honourable, especially at the court, and in the cities of London and Westminster &hellip; I have given order that the boat be brought by land from Bristol to London&#146;  (ibid., sig. B2<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>His achievement seems not to have transformed life for Ferris. He continued to carry out duties as a messenger until at least 1606, when he played a minor role in the apprehension of suspects in the Gunpowder Plot. On 8 November 1605, a &#145;Richard Ferrers&#146;, messenger of the king's chamber, wrote from Gravesend to Robert Cecil with the news that Thomas Percy was riding towards Rochester with the constable of Gravesend in pursuit. On 28 January 1606 &#145;Richard Ferris&#146; delivered to Sir Henry Bromley, MP for Worcestershire, a letter from the privy council concerning two priests residing at the house of a Mr Abington of Hindlipp in the same county. Bromley later testified that Ferris had been employed in arresting these men and that he &#145;was very careful and painful in this service&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 18.37). When the records of the privy council resume in 1613, Ferris does not appear. He may well have lived all his life within the parish of St Margaret's Westminster, for a Richard Ferris was buried there on 23 February 1613.<br>
