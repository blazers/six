<span class="headword">Corbridge,  Thomas  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1304), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, presumably came from Corbridge in Northumberland, a small town adjacent to the archbishop of York's liberty of Hexhamshire. No details survive of his parentage and early years but he became a master, and then a doctor, of theology, and Oxford has been claimed (though without definite proof) as the place of his university education. Indeed his erudition and scholarship, not just in theology but in all the liberal arts, were remarked on by chroniclers. There were several clerks in the York diocese with the territorial surname of Corbridge in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, but no precise relationship can be established.<br>
<br>Throughout his career before his elevation to the archbishopric Corbridge had very strong connections with York, and indeed, rather surprisingly, is not known to have held any ecclesiastical preferment outside the city; no evidence of any parochial preferment has been found. He was a canon of York Minster in the time of Archbishop Giffard (<i>r</i>. 1266&#150;79)&#151;in 1277 he occurs as the prebendary of Osbaldwick&#151;and is found as a clerk of Archbishop Wickwane in 1279 when he was commissioned to proceed in the matter of the election of Robert of Scarborough as dean of York. He acted for the archbishop as his proctor in Rome in 1281, in the course of the latter's bitter dispute with the bishop of Durham, and he was also active in the perennial source of conflict between the two English archbishops over the carrying of their respective primatial crosses erect in the other province. He succeeded Wickwane as chancellor of York Minster, and in 1280 vacated his prebend of Osbaldwick for the richer minster prebend of Stillington, which he held until his own appointment to the archbishopric. He continued to act as an archiepiscopal clerk after the succession of Archbishop Romeyn in 1286, but he later came into conflict with the archbishop in 1290 over his own promotion to the sacristy of the chapel of St Mary and the Holy Angels, a twelfth-century foundation adjacent to the minster in York. Romeyn appointed him as sacrist and Corbridge resigned (conditionally, it is claimed) the chancellorship of the minster. The archbishop then promoted Thomas of Wakefield, at that time subdean of York, to chancellor. Unfortunately Corbridge had difficulty in entering upon the sacristy and tried to resume the already filled chancellorship. Romeyn excommunicated him and Corbridge appealed to the pope, but in 1291 the excommunication was revoked and he was able to obtain peaceful possession of the sacristy.<br>
<br>Following the death of Archbishop Henry Newark on 15 August 1299, Corbridge was elected his successor on 12 November by a majority of the canons of York Minster. Having obtained royal assent from Edward I, who was present in York at the time, the archbishop-elect set off for the Roman curia to obtain papal confirmation and consecration. Pope Boniface VIII set aside the election but provided Corbridge as archbishop, consecrating him on 28 February 1300. The royal mandate for the restoration of the temporalities of the see was issued on 30 April.<br>
<br>As a diocesan Corbridge seems to have been exemplary, if the evidence of his register and related archival material is taken into account. The itinerary constructed from his recorded acts shows that for his years as archbishop he was in his diocese for almost all of the time, except for brief attendances at parliament. Almost immediately he undertook a systematic visitation of parishes and religious houses in his diocese, and when this had been completed during 1300&#150;01, began a second series of visitations in late 1302. The 106 folios of his register bear testimony to an efficient and methodical administrator.<br>
<br>Like so many other medieval archbishops, Corbridge's defence of archiepiscopal claims led inevitably to conflict with others&#151;with the archbishop of Canterbury over the primatial cross business and the attempt by Canterbury to visit the York archiepiscopal jurisdiction of Churchdown in Gloucestershire; with the provost of Beverley over visitations; and with Edward I over the patronage of the sacristy of the chapel of St Mary and the Holy Angels. In this last-mentioned conflict he found himself between competing papal and royal claims. Upon Corbridge's consecration as archbishop the pope had provided his own nephew, Francisco Gaetani, to the new archbishop's vacant prebend of Stillington and the sacristy of St Mary and the Holy Angels, and in due course an archiepiscopal mandate was issued for Gaetani's admission. In the meantime, during the vacancy of the see, King Edward had presented one of his own clerks, John Bussh, to the same positions, since in a vacancy the archiepiscopal patronage belonged to the crown. Gaetani gave up the sacristy in 1303, and the archbishop appointed Gilbert Seagrave in his place, notwithstanding Bussh's claims. Corbridge thereupon found himself arraigned by Bussh in the royal courts, and the king was led to seize the archiepiscopal temporalities. Bussh eventually proved his case against the archbishop (the papal provisions being rejected by the courts) and gained possession in 1304, shortly after Corbridge's death. According to Walter of Guisborough, Corbridge's death was brought on by the hard treatment to which he was subjected by the king and courts in this case.<br>
<br>In his relations with Antony (I) Bek, bishop of Durham (<i>r</i>. 1284&#150;1311), Corbridge had more success than his predecessors. The bishop's conflict with the prior and convent about rights of visitation over his cathedral priory involved the archbishop in the matter of appeals, but Corbridge and Bek were able to come to an agreement about such appeals to the papal curia, which specifically states its purpose as that of avoiding the bitter quarrels of the time of archbishops Wickwane (1279&#150;85) and Romeyn (1286&#150;96).<br>
<br>In 1304 Corbridge fell ill at his residence at Laneham in Nottinghamshire, where he had been staying since early July, and died there on 22 September following. From his register it is clear that he continued to transact business until five days before his death. He was buried in Southwell Minster.<br>
