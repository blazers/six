<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Thomas</span>  (1832&#150;1911), <span class="occ">artist and applied arts administrator</span>, was born at Fallowfield, Manchester, on 19 October 1832, the eldest son of Thomas Armstrong and his wife, Sarah. Educated at a private school at Tarvin, near Chester, he initially began work in his family's cotton business in Manchester. However, after taking up drawing classes at the Manchester Fine Art Academy, he decided to train as a painter, and travelled in 1853 to Paris. There he entered the atelier of Gabriel Navier, under the teaching of Ary Scheffer, who greatly influenced his early style and techniques; in the evenings he also attended the famous Acad&eacute;mie Suisse. In the late summer and autumn of 1854 he spent time in the artists' colony at Barbizon, where he made the acquaintance of Millet. In 1855 he briefly studied in the Acad&eacute;mie Royale at Antwerp under Van Lerius before returning to the family home in Manchester. In 1856 he was back in Paris, where he struck up friendships with George Du Maurier, Edward John Poynter, Thomas Reynolds Lamont, and James Whistler, later immortalized as the &#145;Paris gang&#146; in Du Maurier's popular novel of 1894, <span class="italic">Trilby</span>. Armstrong spent most of 1858 painting in Algiers and in the winter of 1859&#150;60 moved briefly to D&uuml;sseldorf, where he was joined by Du Maurier. There Professor Eduard Bendemann had recently succeeded the Nazarene painter F. W. Schadow as director of the art academy.<br>
<br>On his return to Manchester in 1860, Armstrong devoted himself to painting. From this time he also secured a number of commissions for decorative schemes in houses in the north of England. He finally settled in London in 1864, and with the &#145;Paris gang&#146; regrouped there, Armstrong and his friends began to make their mark on the art community. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1865 to 1877, and subsequently at the Grosvenor Gallery up to 1881. His work, mostly as a landscape and figure painter, can be divided into two main phases. His early work was influenced by the academic and naturalist methods he had met with in France, and on his numerous returns to Manchester at this time he painted the streets and slums of the city, although little of this work survives. His work in Algiers, exhibited at the British Institution on his return, also attempted to portray everyday life. However, this early concern with certain forms of realism contrasts sharply with his later idealized and classical concerns. A painting such as <span class="italic">The Hayfield</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1869 and now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is representative of his later work, although Armstrong attempted to convey a greater degree of poetic feeling than would be found in the vigorous classicism of Leighton, Poynter, and Albert Moore. Whistler remained a strong influence, especially in his paintings of decorative interiors depicting women.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1881 Armstrong married Alice Mary Brine of Shaldon, Devon, and in the same year he was appointed director of the art division of the Department of Science and Art (DSA) at South Kensington, London, in succession to Poynter. His position gave him ultimate direction over the South Kensington Museum and the National Art Training School in their dual concern to provide the highest decorative values in the design of industrially produced objects. His official duties also entailed much travelling, inspecting and awarding prizes at regional art schools. Subsequently, the demands of the post prevented him from continuing his artistic career until after his retirement, despite initially being given studio space at South Kensington. The period of his directorship was marked by a continuous expansion of the DSA's system of art education and museum provision in the regions but, paradoxically, also by the increasing independence of many of the larger schools in major cities such as Birmingham, Glasgow, and his home town of Manchester. Nevertheless, Armstrong was noted for the personal interest which he took in the pupils' work throughout the country, and for his concern to make himself acquainted with the requirements of each district. His own knowledge of the decorative or applied arts had been practically gained on his earlier commissions. Most notably, in 1873 he had employed his friend Randolph Caldecott to help him with a commission for decorative panels of figures and birds for Bank Hall, Chapel-en-le-Frith, Derbyshire. Before his appointment at South Kensington he had also supported Gertrude Jekyll in her efforts to establish at Chelsea a school for art needlework. At the DSA he warmly supported the efforts of Walter Copland Perry to supply art students with an adequate representation of antique sculpture, and developed and carried out the plans of his predecessors Sir Henry Cole and Edward Poynter, for a museum of casts. To his initiative also was due the revival of the art of English enamelling, established at the National School under Professor Dalpeyrat in 1886. He was, too, a warm supporter of the school of art wood-carving, which, although not officially countenanced or aided by the department, received the active support of its chief, Sir John Donnelly.<br>
<br>It was owing to Armstrong's insistence that the Victoria and Albert Museum acquired the scale models of the Camerino of Isabella d'Este, the Appartamento Borgia in the Vatican, the dome of the chapel of St Peter Martyr at Milan, the chief room of the Palazzo Madama at Rome, and other works&#151;copies of important Italian Renaissance decorative schemes which proved to be invaluable to students. He also applied himself to the acquisition of works of art for the museum and brought in Poynter, Morris, and Walter Crane to develop the department's educative role. He successfully continued the DSA's policy of establishing professional and friendly relations with the directors and officials of similar schools and museums on the continent, and to attract them to Britain to compare and explain their methods. Armstrong retired from the DSA in 1898, when he was made CB. He took up painting again, and devoted himself especially to the execution of a mural tablet of two panels of low-relief copper coloured by oils, showing a <span class="italic">Riposo</span> and <span class="italic">Christ in the Temple</span>; this was placed in the church at Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, to the memory of his only child, Ambrose, who had died aged ten years in 1894. Armstrong died after a long illness at his home, Abbots House, Abbots Langley, on 22 April 1911, and was buried at Abbots Langley on 26 April.<br>
