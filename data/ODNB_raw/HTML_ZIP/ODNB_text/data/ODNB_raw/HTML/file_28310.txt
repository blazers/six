<span class="headword">Vincent,  Nathaniel</span>  (1637/8&#150;1697), <span class="occ">nonconformist minister</span>, was the third son of <a name="cosubject_28310"></a><span class="headword">John Vincent</span>  (1590/91&#150;1646)<span class="occ"></span>, heir of Thomas Vincent of Northill, Cornwall, and younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28315/', "Thomas Vincent (1634&#150;1678)")</script>. John matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 15 December 1609, and became a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1612. He was first beneficed in Cornwall, but was ejected from several positions in various parts of the country. After arriving in London in 1642, he was nominated by the committee of the Westminster assembly to the rich rectory of Sedgefield, co. Durham, and instituted in 1644, but died in 1646. His widow, Sarah Vincent, petitioned on 1 November 1656 and in April 1657 for &pound;60 which her husband had lent to the parliament.<br>
<br>Nathaniel was registered at Oxford as a chorister on 18 October 1648, aged ten. He matriculated from Corpus Christi College on 28 March 1655, graduated BA from Christ Church on 13 March 1656, proceeded MA on 11 June 1657, and returned as chaplain to Corpus Christi College. He was appointed by Cromwell as one of the first fellows of Durham College, but never lived there. About 1658, aged twenty, he was preaching at Pulborough, Sussex, and the following year he was ordained and presented to the rectory of Langley Marish, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>After his ejection in August 1662, Vincent served for three years as chaplain to Sir Henry Blount and his wife, Hester, at Tittenhanger, Hertfordshire. Here, as he later recalled, &#145;the world was presented to me in the gayest dress: your house large, and bravely furnished; your gardens delightful; your park and walks hardly to be matched; your table abundantly and sumptuously furnished&#146;  (Vincent, <span class="italic">The Spirit of Prayer</span>, A2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). According to Edmund Calamy, soon after the great fire in 1666 he went to London, where he preached to large crowds among the ruins of the city. In 1669 he was reported to be preaching at Wraysbury and Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire to &#145;2 or 300 none of any quality, the most considerable is one Slocombe a mercer. They say they will uphold their conventicle in spite of the King or Bishop&#146;  (Gordon, 161). But in that year he was also active in London, at Farthing Alley, and in the Southwark parishes of St Saviour, where he preached a sermon published as <span class="italic">The Day of Grace</span> (1669), and St Olave, where, &#145;in a house built on purpose&#146; shortly after the great fire, he &#145;catechiseth the people and baptizeth children some privately some publicly in his conventicle&#146;  (ibid.), although periodically soldiers arrived to prevent his preaching. In the early summer of 1670 Vincent married Anna, whose other name is unknown.<br>
<br>That July Vincent was arrested by soldiers who &#145;rudely pulled him out of the pulpit by the hair of the head, after they had planted four muskets at the four corners of his pulpit&#146;, but &#145;as they were carrying him through the narrow alley adjoining, the multitude crowded in between him and the soldiers, and rescued him&#146;. However, within a few weeks he was recaptured and soon sent to the Marshalsea in Southwark, &#145;where the great number of people that came to visit him gave offence&#146;, so the prisoner &#145;was hurried away&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 1.137&#150;8). His removal to the Gatehouse, Westminster, would have remained secret had not an acquaintance observed it by chance. On 28 September the council granted his wife's petition to visit him, as he was suffering from fever. Towards the end of November Anna petitioned for permission to attend her husband with a nurse, and for a physician to be admitted, &#145;he having been taken dangerously ill&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1660&#150;70</i>, 546). His book <span class="italic">A Covert from the Storm</span> was written in the Gatehouse, &#145;during his close confinement, when few could come at him but his God&#146;  (title-page). The date of Vincent's release is unclear, but Joseph Williamson noted on 31 December 1671 that he was again preaching in Farthing Alley and was &#145;very followed&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1660&#150;85</i>, 341). Vincent was licensed as a presbyterian teacher there on 2 April 1672, following the receipt of a letter in his favour from his sister's husband, James Inness. Vincent's <span class="italic">The Morning Exercise Against Popery</span> (1675) included sermons from other nonconformist ministers, but he continued to publish extensively on his own account. Works on conversion were complemented by <span class="italic">The Little Childes Catechism</span> (1679) and several funeral sermons.<br>
<br>In December 1681, according to the official record, Vincent's meeting-house was visited &#145;by three justices with constables and other officers&#146;; he refused to obey their order to stop preaching, &#145;but proceeded in his discourse, till the noise was so great he could not well be heard&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 640). When the meeting broke up, the justices took a note of the names of those who were known and then departed. However, this account appears to do less than full justice to the incident. As the justices discovered, the meeting-house had both many exits and many peep-holes from which to view visitors: &#145;when the justices commanded his audience to disperse, they were drowned out with hymn-singing while the preacher made his escape&#146;  (Greaves, 92). On 4 January 1683 Oliver Heywood kept a solemn fast with Vincent at his meeting-house. The following Wednesday Vincent appeared at the quarter sessions at Dorking, Surrey, far from his Southwark friends, charged with conventicling under the statute of 35 Elizabeth. He was sentenced to three months in gaol, to be followed by banishment. Heywood took leave of him in the Marshalsea on 29 January 1683, but on Vincent's petition the privy council ordered on 14 February that a writ of error be issued by the attorney-general, returnable in the king's bench, and after the expenditure of &pound;200, and many delays in which he was unable to secure a hearing, news reached Heywood on 26 May that Vincent was &#145;cleared in open court the solicitor saying there was more faults in the indictment than in the man, and so threw it out blessed be God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 89). In the aftermath of the duke of Monmouth's rebellion, some time before 26 January 1686 Vincent was arrested at Exeter on charges of involvement, and sent for by the king.<br>
<br>Apparently for some time an admirer of Richard Baxter, in 1691 Vincent published <span class="italic">An Elegy</span> upon his death. After 1689 he had been less troubled by official harassment, but in 1692 sixty members of his church departed to join the congregation of Richard Fincher at Unicorn Yard, in Southwark. This &#145;made a deeper impression upon his Spirit, than any of the Troubles he had met with for Nonconformity&#146;  (Wilson, 306). Also in 1692, he was nominated, but declined to serve, as a manager of the common fund of presbyterians and Independents. This may have been due to the illness which also gave rise to his <span class="italic">A Present for such as have been Sick &hellip;</span> (1693). In November 1695 he preached a funeral sermon for Edward Laurence, a fellow minister, published as <span class="italic">The Perfect Man Described</span> (1696). He was living at St Giles, Holborn, when he signed his will on 1 February 1697, and died suddenly on 22 June, aged fifty-eight, leaving a widow, Anna, a son, Nathaniel, and daughters Mary, Elizabeth, Hannah, and Judith. He was buried at Bunhill Fields. The funeral sermon was preached by Nathaniel Taylor, who provides evidence that the congregation had been plagued with contention even after the defections to Fincher. He recalled the deceased pastor's &#145;great zeal against bold intruders into the work of the ministry&#146;, who &#145;begin to swarm among us&#146;, warning against false friends whose aim was &#145;the tearing and dividing you in pieces&#146;  (Taylor, 25, 28). Taylor recalled of Vincent that &#145;His compassion to the poor was great, to whom he gave alms and holy advice at the same time&#146;  (ibid., 26). Anthony Wood's assessment of Vincent was also (and more surprisingly) positive: &#145;He was of smarter, more brisk, and florid parts than most of his dull and sluggish fraternity can reasonably pretend to; of a facetious and jolly humour, and a considerable scholar&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.617).<br>
