<span class="headword">Coningsby, Sir  Harry</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1633&#150;1665), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was the son of Sir Thomas Coningsby of North Mimms, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1677), daughter of William Button of Alton, Wiltshire. He was admitted to Middle Temple in February 1633. The family was descended from Sir Humphrey Coningsby, a judge under Henry VIII. This lineage made the vicissitudes the family endured during the civil war, as a result of their loyalty to the crown, even harder to bear. Sir Thomas had been high sheriff of Hertfordshire in 1638 and 1642. Having been arrested at St Albans early in 1643 while endeavouring to execute a commission of array for Charles I, Sir Thomas was imprisoned by Cromwell and had to pay so substantial a fine that the family were financially crippled. In 1658 the decision was taken to sell the North Mimms estate, which Sir Thomas had settled on Martha and her son on 13 February 1640, on the occasion of Harry's marriage to Hester, daughter of James Cambell, an alderman of London. Harry and his mother retired to their other estate of Weild or Wold Hall, Shenley, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>Although Harry was knighted in 1662, the trauma of the decline in family fortunes remained with him, and it was doubtless for this reason that he decided to publish privately his own translation of Boethius, as <span class="italic">The Consolation of Philosophy: a Metrical Translation by Harry Coningsby</span> (1664). In a manuscript letter, dated 30 March 1665, in the British Museum copy of this rare work, Coningsby addresses the son of the new owner of North Mimms, Sir Thomas Hide, and asks him to accept a copy of the translation so that some part of the family may remain in the house. His decision to translate this work by Boethius parallels his father's translation into English of Justus Lipsius's &#145;Discourse on constancy&#146;, no doubt undertaken in response to seven years of imprisonment in the Tower of London. His decision to include with his translation a short essay on his father's unhappy career demonstrates that this was the chief impetus for Sir Harry's work: to understand &#145;for what cause it was the storm came upon him and ruined him&#146;  (Corser, 430). Sir Harry's only son died young. Each of his three daughters married: the eldest, Genevieva, married Thomas Aram of Gray's Inn, London. The second, Marth-Agnes, married Sir William Hickes of Ruckholt, Essex, while the youngest, Theophania, married Edward Bushes of Rocks Bushes in 1670.<br>
