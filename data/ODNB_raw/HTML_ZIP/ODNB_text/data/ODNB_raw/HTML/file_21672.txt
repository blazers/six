<span class="headword">Peacock, Sir  Barnes</span>  (1810&#150;1890), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the third son of Lewis H. Peacock (<i>d</i>. 1839), a solicitor and messenger to the great seal, of 38 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London. On 29 January 1828 he was admitted at the Inner Temple, but postponed his call to the bar until he had practised for several years as a special pleader. He was called on 29 January 1836, joined the home circuit, and was soon considered a sound lawyer.<br>
<br>Peacock made his chief reputation as one of the counsel for Daniel O'Connell in his August 1844 appeal to the House of Lords, and a technical objection he suggested led the majority of the Lords to allow the appeal. He stated that the indictment contained numerous counts and several separate charges, and that some of the counts had been held bad in law. Yet on this indictment, and on good counts and bad counts indiscriminately, one general verdict and judgment had been given. This was in accordance with a practice which, however slovenly, was common and supposedly valid, but the House of Lords declared it a wrong practice, and that a judgment so given could not stand.<br>
<br>Despite this success Peacock did not become a QC until 28 February 1850; he was elected a bencher of the Inner Temple on 10 May the same year (reader, 1864). From April 1852 to April 1859 he was legal member of the supreme council of the viceroy at Calcutta, in succession to Drinkwater Bethune, and there, in the preparation of various codifying acts, he proved his quality as a jurist. Agreeing with &#145;the spirit of the age&#146;  (Ambirajan, 108) in 1853 he presented a bill, subsequently passed, to repeal usury legislation. He wrote an important minute on Oudh, advocating complete annexation. In 1859 he succeeded Sir James Colville in the chief justiceship of the supreme court in Calcutta, and was knighted by patent on 26 May. He held the post, the duties of which were modified in 1862 on the constitution of the high court, until 1870.<br>
<br>Peacock's belief in <i>laissez-faire</i>, property rights, and the classical economists was expressed in his 1862 key judgment on rents and <span class="roman">Act X</span> of 1859 in <i>James Hills v. Ishwar Ghose</i> when, citing Malthus, he ruled that the landowner should profit through rent from increased land value. He assumed zemindars were absolute proprietors and ryots only tenants at will. His judgment was a &#145;bombshell&#146;, a blow to the government policy of protecting the ryots, and was much criticized. Sir Henry Maine wrote of &#145;Peacock's principle of rackrent&#146;  (Ambirajan, 122) and a later historian has alleged that it was &#145;utterly devoid of any understanding of the sociological realities of the Bengal peasantry&#146;  (ibid.). However, Peacock's judgment was reversed by the 1865 verdict of the full bench in <i>Thakoorannee Dossee v. Kashi Prasad Mukherjea</i> (the &#145;Great rent case&#146;), which ruled that rents could be increased by landlords only to the extent of the movement of the price level.<br>
<br>Peacock was indefatigable in moulding the practice of his court as an appellate tribunal, and for eighteen years, with remarkable vigour, worked in the plains of India with only one furlough. In 1870 he resigned and returned to England, where, in June 1872, he was appointed under the 1871 act a paid member (&pound;5000 p.a.) of the judicial committee of the privy council. There his knowledge of Indian customs, his industry and accuracy made him especially useful. He was sitting to hear appeals only three days before his death.<br>
<br>Peacock married twice: first, in 1835, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1865), daughter of William Fanning; and second, in 1870, Georgina, daughter of Major-General Charles Lionel Showers CB. He was slight and short, an indifferent speaker, but had exceptional memory and application. He died from heart failure at his home, 40 Cornwall Gardens, Kensington, London, on 3 December 1890. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
<br>Peacock's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_21672"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Barnes Peacock</span>  (1836&#150;1894)<span class="occ"></span>, was educated at East India College, Haileybury, entered the Bengal civil service, and landed in India in February 1857. He was employed in the revenue and judicial department, became registrar of the high court in May 1864, was president of the committee on the affairs of the king of Oudh, officiating secretary to the board of revenue in 1871, a magistrate and collector in 1873, commissioner of the Dacca division in 1878 and of the Presidency division in 1881. He was admitted at the Inner Temple on 16 April 1866 and called to the bar on 9 June 1880. In 1883 he was appointed chief secretary to the government of Bengal for the judicial, political, and appointments departments, an acting member of the board of revenue in 1884, and an actual member in 1887, and in 1890 he was made a CSI (21 May) and retired. He died on board the <i>Britannia</i>, off Sicily, on 14 April 1894.<br>
