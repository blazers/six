<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stephen, Sir  James</span>  (1789&#150;1859), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Lambeth, London, on 3 January 1789, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26373/', "James Stephen (1758&#150;1832)")</script> and his first wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stent (<i>bap</i>. 1758, <i>d</i>. 1796).<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Stephen lived with his parents for five years at St Kitts in the West Indies, when an attack of smallpox permanently weakened his eyesight, so after his family returned to England he was sent not to a large school but to a variety of small, private ones. In 1806 he enrolled at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, but lived in a hotel, perhaps an indication of his intense shyness, and said later that a move to Bond Street &#145;would not have deprived me of any aids for intellectual discipline or for acquiring literary or scientific knowledge&#146;  (quoted in L. Stephen, 31). In November 1811 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and the following year he took his LLB degree. Having received some help from his father, he began to practise in the court of chancery, and in 1813 was appointed legal adviser to the Colonial Office. On 22 December 1814 he married Jane Catherine (1793&#150;1875), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28188/', "John Venn")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28184/', "Venn, Henry (1725&#150;1797)")</script>], rector of Clapham, a leading member of the Clapham Sect and one of the founders of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), whose committee Stephen joined and served on for nine years.<br>
<br>At first Stephen's work at the Colonial Office was to review all acts passed in the colonies. He did this for fees which totalled between &pound;600 and &pound;800 a year, while he came to earn more than &pound;1500 a year in his private legal practice; however, in time the office became more demanding, asking for help on questions concerning the colonies ceded by France and Holland, in drafting the complex <span class="roman">New South Wales Act</span>, and many other matters. The result was a breakdown through overwork in 1822, the year his eldest son, Herbert Venn (1822&#150;1846)&#151;the first of the Stephens' five children&#151;was born; Stephen resigned from the CMS committee and told the under-secretary at the Colonial Office, Robert Wilmot-Horton, the following April that he could not &#145;execute to my own or your satisfaction the various duties which you have entrusted to me&#146;  (Young, 60). So he gave up his private practice in return for &#145;an assurance of permanency&#146; and a salary of &pound;1500&#151;as well as, according to his colleague and friend Henry Taylor, with a view to gaining influence on the slavery question. During the next twenty-four years he was to develop his position as an important adviser on colonial policy, being appointed assistant under-secretary in 1834 and permanent under-secretary in 1836, at a salary of &pound;2000, just as he was beginning to grow stout and his reddish hair was turning white.<h2>
<a name="Ashyworkaholic"></a>A shy workaholic</h2>In modern terminology Stephen was a &#145;workaholic&#146;. In 1826 Wilmot-Horton said Stephen was working ten hours a day, and twenty years later the latter was recording in his diary that he worked eleven hours&#151;&#145;write, read, read, write or rather dictate all day, and weary eyes in the evening &hellip; without any partner. It is only by starvation and seclusion that I am able to get through it&#146;&#151;but he laboured on, even adding to his work between 1838 and 1842 by dictating, usually early in the morning, articles for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, which he published as <span class="italic">Essays in Ecclesiastical Biography</span> in 1849. Here he indicated his belief in &#145;the Divine intervention of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe&#146;  (J. Stephen, 2.342). History, he wrote, was &#145;but the incoherent rhapsody of wild joys and maddening sorrows if not regarded as the progressive fulfilment of the Supreme Will&#146;  (2.344); the field of ecclesiastical history was &#145;reverently tracing the footsteps of Divine Providence moving among the ways and works of man, imparting dignity to events otherwise unimportant and a deep significance to occurrences in any other view trivial&#146;  (2.291&#150;2), since providence might employ &#145;the evil passions of man as reluctant instruments of the Divine mercy&#146;, and it was by &#145;antagonistic passions, prejudices and follies that the equipoise of this most belligerent planet is chiefly preserved&#146;  (1.250). Stephen must have believed that he was contributing to the &#145;consummation of the designs of Providence&#146;  (2.454), for, as he urged settlement in the north of Australia, for example, he insisted that its colonization was &#145;one of those vast schemes of national policy into which Great Britain has been drawn and &hellip; which must be regarded as one of the most impressive movements of Divine Providence in the government of this world&#146;  (minute on Sir John Barrow to Stephen, 11 Jan 1843, CO 201/329, fols. 46&#150;7).<br>
<br>One reason for his long hours was that Stephen was unwilling, if not unable, to delegate work. Taylor thought he &#145;preferred to engross it into his own hands and not to be much helped&#146;  (Taylor, 1.233); certainly in May 1846 he opposed a plan of Gladstone's to reorganize the office and reduce his burdens&#151;&#145;it would spell the word of doom to my official importance&#146;, he wrote in his diary. So he read every incoming dispatch, and minuted them all, dictating instructions such as &#145;put by&#146; or &#145;to the Treasury&#146; on even the most trivial or routine, though on some he would dictate lengthy minutes or draft replies. He rarely took a holiday, and when he did he would take an amanuensis to the country with him so his reading and dictating could continue. This meant that he was keeping an eye on all the colonies, watching their expenditure and their administration, and recalling precedents, where his extraordinary memory stood him in good stead. He was always on the lookout for maladministration, as governors such as Sir John Franklin and Sir John Eardley-Wilmot among others discovered, and would examine with great care cases of minor officials that were reported to him. He improved the routine of the office in London, but taking so much into his own hands did not properly exploit its resources.<br>
<br>As had appeared at Cambridge, Stephen was very shy&#151;&#145;shy beyond all the shyness you could imagine in anyone whose soul had not been pre-existent in a wild duck&#146;, wrote Taylor in his autobiography, and in any interview went on in &#145;a continuous stream of discourse, as if afraid to stop, not knowing what might happen&#146;  (Taylor, 2.303&#150;4). He preferred writing to face-to-face discussion, and for this reason failed to settle interdepartmental disputes quickly, failed to speed up interdepartmental delays when his written communications proved ineffective, and, though he admitted that the extent of Treasury business was often responsible for its delays, never tried to establish a working relationship with a department almost next door.<h2>
<a name="MrOverSecretaryStephenandthecolonies"></a>Mr Over-Secretary Stephen and the colonies</h2>Stephen's own industry and abilities produced a contempt for those less hard-working, less conscientious, or less talented. According to his 1846 diary, of the twelve secretaries of state under whom he served, he thought only two, Huskisson and Lord John Russell, were not &#145;common place men in high stations&#146;&#151;apparently including Stanley (fourteenth earl of Derby), Gladstone (&#145;the poorest and feeblest of all my Downing Street rulers&#146;), and Grey (&#145;hard, cold, peremptory and self-willed&#146;). Of his departmental colleagues and subordinates, he wrote that &#145;not one of them but Murdoch deserves his salary&#146;, and in 1854 he asserted that most of them had possessed<blockquote>only in a low degree, and some of them in a degree almost incredibly low, either the talents or the habits of men of business, or the industry, the zeal, or the knowledge required for the effective performance of their appropriate functions. (Young, 256&#150;7)</blockquote>It was not surprising that he was known as &#145;Mr Over-Secretary Stephen&#146; or &#145;King Stephen&#146;.<br>
<br>Some historians have done Stephen's reputation a disservice in asserting, like some of his contemporaries, that, as Taylor put it, he &#145;virtually governed the colonial empire&#146;  (Taylor, 1.233). He was an administrator, not a policy maker. He would give advice based on special knowledge, experience, and precedent rather than on ideology. He usually gave it tentatively and it was not infrequently overridden. For example, he strongly objected to the plans of the Wakefieldian South Australian and New Zealand companies, but the government on the whole supported them. He opposed suggested controls for emigrant ships, but governments carried the <span class="roman">Passenger Acts</span> of 1828, 1835, and 1842. His minutes frequently note that reference is to be made to the secretary or under-secretary of state for instructions in such matters as colonial defence, religion and church establishments, education, the affairs of New Zealand, or, as he minuted in 1844, if the subject involved &#145;questions of Rural, Commercial or Political Economy, with which I am not conversant&#146;. Though in 1845 he might tell Under-Secretary Hope, partly in jest, that he was &#145;the only Professor in England of my art&#151;the art of understanding everything connected with the Constitution, Charters and Laws of some forty Colonies&#146;  (quoted in Buckner, <span class="italic">Responsible Government</span>, 32), and though his son James insisted that he had &#145;all the special knowledge which his position required &hellip; and which no other man in England possessed to anything like the same extent&#146;  (L. Stephen, 88), yet speaking of Australia in 1830 he had admitted that &#145;had I the understanding of Jeremy Bentham himself I should distrust my judgement as to what is really practicable in such remote and anomalous Societies&#146;  (quoted in Shaw, <span class="italic">Convicts and the Colonies</span>, 239) and was to ask his diary as late as 1846, &#145;who is the prodigy that understands affairs colonial&#146;?<br>
<br>Perhaps Stephen's greatest contribution to colonial affairs was his recognition of the difficulty of controlling colonies from London. In this sense his other nickname&#151;&#145;Mr Mother-Country&#146;&#151;was a misnomer. Attempts to run affairs from London &#145;cannot but terminate in defeat&#146;, he wrote as early as 1828  (TNA: PRO, CO 323/45, fols. 198&#150;200); &#145;we are almost always worsted&#146;, he would repeat in 1841. He also thought that as a general rule the imperial government should support local governors. &#145;The wisest Governor may judge erroneously but the wisest stranger to the Country must guess erroneously&#151;at least the chance of guessing right is so slight as to be evanescent&#146;  (quoted in Knaplund, 261).<br>
<br>Stephen developed these general attitudes over time, in the light of experience. At first he had been rather more interventionist, particularly on the slavery question. Here he had been brought up on the views of his father, his mother, his stepmother and her father, and his own mentor, William Wilberforce, and the anti-slavery societies were trying to follow the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 with measures to improve the lot of the slaves. Reviewing colonial legislation Stephen was able regularly to reveal defects in the many slavery registration acts and to have them disallowed, until an <span class="roman">Imperial Act</span> was passed in 1820 to end such disputes. In the subsequent struggle over the &#145;melioration&#146; policy, in 1824 Stephen drew up a model order for the treatment of slaves in the crown colonies and thereafter examined the colonial codes minutely against its provisions. His analysis led to the latter being frequently disallowed, and though, when prime minister in 1828&#150;30, the duke of Wellington objected to reports coming from &#145;a partisan of abolition&#146;, over time they helped to educate ministers, politicians, and the public about the conditions of the slaves. As the popular campaign for slave emancipation strengthened, the reforming whig government decided to legislate, and in 1833, after Stanley, the secretary of state, gave up the task of drafting a bill, it fell to Stephen to do so. Of necessity working over the weekend&#151;allegedly on one of only two occasions in his life on a Sunday&#151;he produced the complex bill, covering twenty-six pages, in forty-eight hours, playing the part of the perfect public servant in helping his minister to implement his policy and making an enormous contribution to its success.<br>
<br>Chronologically the next important colonial problem was in Canada, where by 1836 unrest had been simmering for some time. Here, Stephen's advice was inconsistent, a memorandum in December 1837 being distinguished for &#145;clarity of analysis and futility of planning&#146;, according to John M. Ward  (<span class="italic">Colonial Self-Government</span>, 60), though a month earlier in a letter to Sir George Arthur he had deplored &#145;such putting off, such dawdlings, such panics &hellip; such a paralysis &hellip; I never before saw or imagined, much less partook of&#146;, adding that &#145;a resolute stand by a resolute man a few weeks ago would have subdued this violence. &hellip; Even yet there is time to stem the torrent by opposing a stern and uncompromising front to the Agitators&#146;  (quoted in Burroughs, 92)&#151;which is hardly what he had been advocating previously.<br>
<br>While the Canadian troubles were going on, Stephen made what turned out to be perhaps his greatest contributions to colonial government, which sprang from the need to confirm the dismissal of a minor official in South Australia. Following precedents in Van Diemen's Land in 1832 and New South Wales in 1836, and the recommendation of the Gosford commission in Canada in 1837, in this case and then more significantly in Canada, in a dispatch on official tenure, Stephen persuaded Lord John Russell to lay down the principle that a colonial governor could dismiss his officials for reasons of policy, without proving them guilty of any offence. This allowed a governor to get rid of the incompetent or simply the unpopular if he wanted to, so that he could&#151;and in future would&#151;change ministers at the wish of a representative assembly; though that was not what either Stephen or Russell had in mind at the time, it opened the door to the policy of lords Elgin and Grey in Canada a few years later. This, together with his belief that, on the whole, colonial governors should be trusted and given a large measure of freedom from instructions from London, paved the way for colonies to become self-governing as governors came to take the advice of colonial ministers; as a result they would remain within the empire, without becoming independent as quickly as he forecast.<h2>
<a name="Changingviewsofthecolonies"></a>Changing views of the colonies</h2>Stephen's attitude to the empire changed over time and varied according to circumstances. At the time of the Canadian uprising he wanted to uphold British power in North America. But having, according to his son, &#145;a morbidly vivid perception of possible evils and remote dangers&#146;  (L. Stephen, 51), by 1843 he was fearing this was impossible. Though rebellions were over, a terrible democracy seemed inevitable:<blockquote>All those things must float to the surface of Society which one would wish to keep out of sight. &hellip; Canada is &hellip; a theatre for selfish conflicts under the specious pretext of Public Spirit &hellip; Mere democracy must triumph there, and the ultimate catastrophe is not difficult to foretell. (quoted in Shaw, <span class="italic">Sir George Arthur</span>, 225)</blockquote>In 1846 he thought Elgin's appointment as governor-general might be the last ever made. However, in retirement in 1850 he thought that &#145;relaxing the bonds of authority&#146; as had been done in Canada had been the right course, and though in time the colonies &#145;would cut the last cable that binds them to us&#146; that day was not to be feared  (quoted in C. Stephen, 143&#150;4). Sometimes the colonies were &#145;wretched burdens&#146;. &#145;If we acquire the whole of Africa it is a worthless possession&#146;, he wrote in 1841; to settle in Natal would cost money and lead to &#145;the consumption of treasure, the waste of human life and a warfare alike inglorious, unprofitable and afflicting&#146;  (quoted in Morrell, 141). On the other hand, he had wanted to colonize New Zealand in the 1830s in order to protect the Maori, and he appreciated the &#145;great territorial settlements&#146; in North America. He also wanted to use the empire to promote Christianity. Even though he thought that &#145;human reason must toil in vain for demonstrative certainties&#146;  (Stephen, 1.200), he was convinced that &#145;he who should induce any heathen people to adopt the mere ceremonial of the Church &hellip; and to recognize the authority of its Divine head would confer on them a blessing exceeding all which mere philanthropy has ever accomplished&#146;  (minute, 7 Feb 1846, CO 54/223, fol. 302). Hence his opposition to assisting Indian immigration to the West Indies, which would lead to the &#145;introduction of many thousand idolaters trained from infancy in the barbarous and obscene rites of Hindoos superstition&#146;; hence his objection to protecting the lands of Buddhist priests in Ceylon because they practised &#145;abominations to which not merely the revealed law of God but the general conscience of mankind is irreconcilably hostile&#146;  (quoted in Morrell, 529 and n. 4), though in both these cases his views were ignored.<h2>
<a name="Laterlifedeathandreputation"></a>Later life, death, and reputation</h2>Eventually Stephen's long hours of work had their inevitable effect. Journeys to London from Windsor, where he lived between 1842 and 1846 while his younger sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26375/', "James Fitzjames Stephen (1829&#150;1894)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36271/', "Leslie Stephen (1832&#150;1904)")</script>, the future editor of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, were at Eton, increased his fatigue, and the death of his eldest son in Dresden in October 1846 made him, according to James, &#145;a changed man&#146; (his influence on his sons is discussed in their articles). He began to think of retirement, and a severe illness the following year forced him to take sick leave. He was appointed a privy councillor on 30 October 1847; in 1848 he resigned, and on 27 April was appointed KCB. In 1849 he returned to colonial work, advising Grey on the constitutions he was proposing for the Australian colonies and then serving on the privy council committee appointed to consider them. Later that year he was appointed regius professor of modern history at Cambridge, a position seen at that time as largely honorific. He lived in Cambridge for a time and twice delivered a course of lectures on the history of France, but ill health and allegations by a number of dons that the epilogue to the published edition of his <span class="italic">Essays</span> was heretical, casting doubts on the belief in the eternal damnation of the wicked, prompted him to leave. In 1853 he settled in Westbourne Terrace, London, and was professor of history at the East India Company's Haileybury College at Hertford from 1855 until it was abolished in 1858. The following January he hurt himself when out walking, and a visit to Homburg for his health in the summer had no benefit. He died at Koblenz on the way home on 14 September, and was buried at Kensal Green. He was survived by his wife (who died in 1875), two of his sons (James Fitzjames and Leslie), and his daughter and biographer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36269/', "Caroline Emelia Stephen (1834&#150;1909)")</script>, his elder daughter, Frances Wilberforce (1824&#150;1825), having died in infancy.<br>
<br>Contemporary attacks on Stephen damaged his reputation, though they should have been directed at the ministers responsible for making policy, but in the first half of the twentieth century his defenders reacted too strongly. More recent writers have been more ready to recognize his limitations as well as his strengths. He was a distinguished public servant, but he was not a policy maker like some other so-called statesmen-in-disguise&#151;Edwin Chadwick, Rowland Hill, James Kay-Shuttleworth, and others. However, there can be no doubt that he helped to improve administration both in London and in the colonies, and his emphasis on the limits of imperial control undoubtedly had a good effect on those that followed him.<br>
