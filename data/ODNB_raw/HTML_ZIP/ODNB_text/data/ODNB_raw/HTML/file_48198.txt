<span class="headword">Smith, Sir  Prince</span>, first baronet  (1840&#150;1922), <span class="occ">worsted machinery manufacturer</span>, was born on 3 September 1840 at Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, the only son of Prince Smith (1819&#150;1890), a mechanic, and his wife, Martha, the daughter of John Edmondson, a Keighley contractor. He was educated at Wesley College, Sheffield, until about the age of sixteen and then entered the family business of William Smith &amp; Sons at Waggon Fold, Keighley. William, his grandfather, had commenced business in Keighley in 1795, making precision parts for spinning machines. The firm was expanded in the early 1830s, with the opening of a foundry to provide castings. William had seven sons, of whom two died in their twenties; the others were all apprenticed within the firm and joined their father, and in due course were taken into partnership. Prince Smith's father was the fourth son, and perhaps the most dynamic of William's offspring. At William's death in 1850 the brothers continued the partnership, but it was dissolved in 1865, leaving Prince Smith senior and his brother William in control of the textile machine-making business. They built the large Worth Valley works in Keighley, but dissolved their partnership in 1869.<br>
<br>Prince Smith senior continued the business on his own account, taking his son Prince junior into partnership and acquiring the large Burlington Shed in Keighley from Samuel Cunliffe Lister. Prince Smith junior progressively took charge, and finally assumed control of the firm on the death of his father in 1890. By that stage it had developed into one of the biggest manufacturing firms in the worsted trade. In 1878 it employed around 750 people; by the 1890s the workforce had doubled, making Smiths the largest employer in Keighley and district, a major centre of machinery manufacture. The firm extended its products to the full range of manufacturing for the preparation and spinning of worsted yarn. Smith exerted firm control over the business, believing that success was highly dependent on a trustworthy product and the confidence of his clientele. He relied on the reputation of his machines and on personal contact with his customers. Unlike many of the other textile machine manufacturers of the day, he avoided exhibitions and gave little attention to advertising his products. Much of his business was local to Yorkshire, where the British worsted industry was largely concentrated, but by the 1890s his machines were being exported to all centres of worsted manufacture in the world, as part of what was by then a major trade for the British economy.<br>
<br>Smith married Martha Ann (<i>d</i>. 1913), the daughter of John Greenwood, a corn miller, of Skipton in Craven, Yorkshire, in 1864. They had one son and two daughters. Their son, also Prince Smith, born on 13 October 1869, married Maud Mary, the daughter of Henry Wright of Keighley, in 1894, entered his father's business in 1887, and became increasingly responsible for its management in the years before the First World War. During the war he was one of the managers of the national shell factory in Keighley.<br>
<br>Smith himself appears to have been technically very able, but it is not clear that he made any very significant contributions to the development of worsted preparatory and spinning machinery. As a businessman he appears to have shown initiative and judgement, providing direction and purpose in the years of major expansion of the firm. His involvement in other affairs was minimal. Of the Liberal persuasion, he took little interest in local or national politics. Like many in his industry he supported free trade, but was not active in the campaign for it. He was a Wesleyan, and supported local organizations in Keighley&#151;notably Keighley Victoria Hospital. At various times he was a member of the Bradford exchange, a director of the Bradford District Bank, and a JP first for the West Riding and then, on his retirement, for the East Riding. He was created a baronet for his service to industry in 1911. His leisure interests included music and golf. In the 1890s he acquired an estate in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, and about 1907 retired from his home at Hillbrook, Keighley, to an estate at Southburn, near Driffield, East Riding of Yorkshire, where he died on 20 October 1922, following a heavy cold. He was buried in Keighley cemetery on 23 October.<br>
<br>At the time of Smith's death the family firm was at the peak of its business activity. Having engaged in munitions work during the war, it recovered its markets and in 1922 employed 1800 people, making it one of the largest manufacturers of worsted combing and spinning machinery in the world. However, like other textile machinery firms at the period, it later suffered from declining business. Smith's son, the third Prince Smith, who on inheriting the baronetcy changed his name to Sir Prince Prince-Smith by deed poll, took the firm into an amalgamation with Hall and Stells Ltd in 1931, creating Prince Smith and Stells Ltd, of which he served as president until his death in 1940.<br>
