<span class="headword">Martin,  Jonathan</span>  (1782&#150;1838), <span class="occ">arsonist</span>, was born at Highside House, near Hexham, the son of (William) Fenwick Martin, who held several occupations including publican, coach builder, fencing master, and tanner, and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thompson. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18192/', "John Martin")</script>, the artist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18218/', "William Martin")</script> were among his twelve siblings. Jonathan Martin was tongue-tied at birth; an operation in his sixth year enabled him to speak, though with some impediment. He was partly brought up by his grandmother, Ann Thompson, a woman of extreme protestant beliefs and a vivid sense of hell. As a boy he saw his sister murdered by a neighbour, Peggy Hobuck. He was sent to his uncle's farm to recover from the shock, worked with sheep, and was then apprenticed to a tanner. In 1804 he went to London and was seized by the press-gang for the navy. He served for about six years in HMS <i>Hercules</i>, seeing action at Copenhagen in 1807 and off Corunna in 1809. At this time he began to have violent and wonderful dreams. In 1810 he was paid off from the navy, resumed work as a tanner, and married for the first time. His son Richard was born in 1814. Martin was converted to Christianity; he joined the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion and became violently hostile to the Church of England. In 1817 he threatened the assassination of Edward Legge, bishop of Oxford, for which he was tried and committed to West Auckland Lunatic Asylum; he was later moved to Gateshead Asylum. He escaped from Gateshead on 17 June 1820, was recaptured, and, after going on hunger strike, again escaped on 1 July 1821. In the asylum he resumed painting (having painted intermittently since childhood); a witness at his trial in 1829 recalled his work as having &#145;extraordinary marks of uninstructed talent, mixed with frenzy and wildness&#146;  (Balston, <span class="italic">Jonathan Martin</span>, 30). Martin's wife died in 1821. After his escape he resumed work as a tanner and preached. The Wesleyans refused to have him back and the Primitive Methodists soon excluded him from their chapels. Even so, by his own account he converted several hundred people. At Lincoln in 1826 he published his autobiography (with further editions in 1828, 1829, and 1830). It was dictated to R. E. Leary of Lincoln and remains of much vivid interest: Martin had a sharp memory for dramatic incident. In 1828 he married again; his second wife was Maria Hudson, a woman twenty years his junior; they had no children.<br>
<br>The Martins settled in York and seem at this time to have been fairly prosperous. Soon after his marriage, however, Martin suffered a further breakdown, which again took an anti-clerical form. He hung threatening placards&#151;which included his name and address&#151;on the railings of York Minster, but the authorities did not take them seriously. On 1 February 1829 Martin attended evensong in the minster, during which he was upset by a buzzing noise from the organ. Apparently on a sudden decision, he secreted himself in the minster (the cathedral watchman had recently been discharged), lighting a lamp in the bell-tower, which was disregarded by those who saw it. Late that night he set fire to the woodwork of the choir and escaped through a window. Next morning at about 7 a.m. smoke was seen coming from one of the doors. Only after it was discovered did the fire really take hold, the organ and the roof of the choir suddenly catching light at about 8 a.m. The fire was not brought under control until late in the afternoon and was not extinguished until the next afternoon. The roof of the central aisle was entirely destroyed from the lantern tower almost to the east window (a distance of 131 feet), as was most of the woodwork in the interior, including the organ and its screen, the tabernacle work, the stalls, galleries, bishop's throne, and the pulpit. It was one of the most spectacular consequences of arson in modern British history.<br>
<br>Martin was arrested near Hexham on 6 February and was tried (on a capital charge) at York Castle; Henry Brougham acted as his defending counsel, probably paid for by John Martin. On 31 March 1829 he was declared not guilty on grounds of insanity (the judge reversing the jury's original verdict). Martin was described at the time of his trial as rather stout, about 5 feet 6 inches high, with large, bushy red whiskers. He was confined in St Mary's Hospital, London, where he died on 3 June 1838. His son Richard had been brought up mainly by John Martin, and committed suicide in John Martin's house three months after his father's death.<br>
