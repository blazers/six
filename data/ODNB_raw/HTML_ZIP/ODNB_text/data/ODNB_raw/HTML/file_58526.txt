<span class="headword">Lankester <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pope]</span>,  Phebe</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Penelope]</span>  (1825&#150;1900), <span class="occ">writer on botany and health</span>, was born on 10 April 1825 in Manchester, the eldest daughter of Samuel Pope, a former mill owner, and his wife, Phebe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rushton. She grew up in middle-class Highbury, a residential suburb of London, attended a dissenting ladies' academy in Mill Hill, and later received private instruction in Manchester. On 3 July 1845 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16054/', "Dr Edwin Lankester (1814&#150;1874)")</script>, medical reformer, popular science lecturer, and writer, who was coroner for central Middlesex from 1862 until his death. They lived for many years at 8 Savile Row, London, and had eleven children, seven of whom survived; one was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34406/', "Sir (Edwin) Ray Lankester (1847&#150;1929)")</script>, biologist, teacher, and later director of the British Museum (Natural History).<br>
<br>Phebe Lankester worked with her husband in 1846&#150;7 on articles for the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</span> (1833&#150;58), and on articles for the natural history section of the <span class="italic">National Cyclopaedia</span> (1854&#150;5). In 1859, after her last child was born, she embarked on her own writing. <span class="italic">A Plain and Easy Account of British Ferns</span> (1860) describes more than forty indigenous ferns with information on varieties, localities, and medicinal and other uses. The book, a revision of Edwin Bosanquet's manual from the 1850s, reflects the Victorian fern craze. Lankester enthusiastically promotes collecting and cultivating ferns, particularly by the use of Wardian cases, as the way &#145;to bring something of the verdure of a country lane into the close atmosphere of a city&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Plain and Easy Account of British Ferns</span>, ix). While acknowledging the harmful effects of the rapacity of collectors, she recommends digging up ferns found in the countryside. Her book was advertised in conjunction with a descriptive folio album into which fern collectors could paste specimens. It continued in print into the 1890s under the title <span class="italic">British Ferns</span>. Her next book, <span class="italic">Wild Flowers Worth Notice</span> (1861), published as a companion volume, had illustrations by the botanical artist J. E. Sowerby. Lankester features about a hundred native plants, such as the buttercup, and discusses botanical aspects and uses of wild flowers, and legends associated with them. She celebrates the benefits of botany for people of all ages and social classes, and her preface contains a ringing call for science education in schools.<br>
<br>As a writer, Lankester benefited from Victorian interest in making science accessible and inviting. She contributed articles between 1861 and 1864 to the periodical <span class="italic">Popular Science Review</span>. She was conversant with botany in its technical and applied aspects, and contributed substantially to J. T. Boswell Syme's <span class="italic">English Botany</span> (1863&#150;86), the third edition of a foundational work of botanical classification and description. This important new edition sharply distinguished between technical material and &#145;popular&#146; or &#145;literary&#146; information. Phebe Lankester wrote nearly 400 entries for the &#145;popular portion&#146;; her entries offered historical and poetic remarks about English plants as well as general information on their uses and properties.<br>
<br>Phebe Lankester was widowed in 1874, aged forty-nine. She continued her writing career and cultivated a juvenile audience with <span class="italic">Botany for Elementary Schools</span> (1875), in <span class="roman">Allman's Penny School Series</span>, and <span class="italic">Talks about Plants</span> (1879). Her writing repertory also included books on health. <span class="italic">Talks about Health</span> (1874) features a mother and son discussing such topics as fresh air, digestion, and proper exercise. <span class="italic">Domestic Economy for Young Girls</span> (1875), another title in <span class="roman">Allman's Penny School Series</span>, emphasizes the importance of women's role in home management and teaches about food preparation, clothing, and household cleanliness. This book addresses daughters who will enter into domestic service, later to become wives and mothers, and encourages them to keep a penny account book and deposit money into the Post Office Savings Bank. <span class="italic">The National Thrift Reader, with Directions for Possessing and Preserving Health</span> (1880), a reading book for schools (with vocabulary lists), consists of short chapters on topics such as &#145;What to do with money&#146;, &#145;Life insurance&#146;, and &#145;Health is wealth&#146;. Recurrent themes throughout Lankester's books on health topics are the tyranny of female fashion (such as high-heeled shoes) and concerns about sanitary conditions in houses, especially drainage and sanitary arrangements.<br>
<br>Issues of women's health, education, and social circumstances also featured in Phebe Lankester's magazine writing for <span class="italic">The Queen</span>, <span class="italic">Chambers's Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">Magazine of the Arts</span>. For twenty years after her husband's death she wrote a popular syndicated weekly column in East Anglian and other provincial newspapers under the pseudonym Penelope. Addressing women of all social classes, she discussed such topics as increasing female employment, women's welfare, female emigration, and the importance of placing women on local poor-law boards.<br>
<br>As a widow she lived for many years at 5 Wimpole Street, London, with her youngest son and two of her unmarried daughters. She died there on 9 April 1900, and was buried two days later beside her husband in the churchyard of the Hampstead parish church. The <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary commented on her &#145;wonderful energy&#146;. A portrait of her by Sir Hubert von Herkomer shows a kind face, strength of character, and a calm, steady gaze.<br>
