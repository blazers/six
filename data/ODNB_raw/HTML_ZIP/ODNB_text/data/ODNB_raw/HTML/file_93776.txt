<span class="headword">Rosenthal,  Jack Morris</span>  (1931&#150;2004), <span class="occ">television dramatist</span>, was born on 8 September 1931 at 27 Kendall Road, Crumpsall, Manchester, the younger son of Samuel Rosenthal (<i>d</i>. 1966), a waterproof garment worker of Russian-Jewish origin, and his wife, Leah (Lakey), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller, then a machinist, later a dressmaker. His education blazed the episodic trail of much of his subsequent writing for television, starting with the bluntly named Jew School in Derby Street until, some months after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he and his brother were evacuated to Blackpool. They were billeted on a singularly chilly and repressive household. Within a year their mother fetched them back to Manchester, whereupon their home was bombed. His father stayed at his job, living in digs during the week, while the rest of the family moved to Colne in north-east Lancashire. There Rosenthal won a scholarship to Colne grammar school. He enrolled briefly at University College, Leicester, before settling on Sheffield University, where in 1953 he graduated in English and modern languages. This was followed by two years' national service in the navy as a Russian coder.<br>
<br>Rosenthal had made a start as a junior copywriter in an advertising agency when Granada, the London-based cinema chain which had been awarded the weekday commercial television contract for the north of England, set up a temporary office in Manchester. Rosenthal inquired about a job and was offered the opportunity to become the company's first graduate trainee. As Granada TV was not due to go on the air until the following year, 1956, and its studios were only then being built, he was at first given boring, even menial, jobs in Granada picture houses around London. When at last he was recalled to Manchester he found that he was now but one of scores of eager young aspirants. He was made a researcher, along with the future television eminences Jeremy Isaacs and David Plowright. Once the station became operational their role was enlarged to take in the provision of continuity announcements, trailers, and commentary for the outside broadcasts which were a feature of commercial television in its early days.<br>
<br>Not until 1960 did Rosenthal get the chance to write television drama and comedy. Another of the young lions, Tony Warren, had come up with a proposal for a serial about ordinary lives in an ordinary quarter of their own city, or one very like it. It was given a trial run of six weeks, but was soon extended to become British television's first long-lasting soap opera, <span class="italic">Coronation Street</span> (which was still being broadcast at the time of Rosenthal's death). Warren had made it clear that should this come about he wasn't prepared to write on and on. Other hands would have to take over. Rosenthal was one of those chosen, and went on to furnish 161 episodes, if increasingly tempted to tease the everyday realism that was expected. In 1964 he conspired with a fellow writer, Harry Driver, to insinuate a version of the classic western <span class="italic">High Noon</span> (starring Gary Cooper) into the story line. The role of the embattled sheriff desperately seeking allies as his vengeful enemies approached was allotted to the character Len Fairclough, once the bad lad of the community, now the only one to challenge a trio of young hoodlums terrorizing it. The pastiche was declared when the episode immediately before the showdown ended with a shot of the three villains framed by the hero's legs, while the usual title music was replaced by that of the ballad &#145;Do not forsake me&#146; from the film score. In later, more regimented, years this would have been unthinkable.<br>
<br>Having wisely remained at Granada on a freelance contract rather than a staff appointment, Rosenthal was already chipping in episodes to various BBC and rival ITV series devised by other writers. He was not able to originate much himself until he was invited to contribute to a Granada anthology of single plays on the theme of &#145;management&#146;, broadcast in 1968. His dwelt on the misadventures of a municipal refuse-collecting crew, so droll that it straightway spawned a series, <span class="italic">The Dustbinmen</span>, which ran to nineteen episodes with Rosenthal also acting as producer. This dual role was confirmed with <span class="italic">The Lovers</span> (1970&#150;71), following the tender, if not wholly innocent, manoeuvrings of a teenage couple as, under the shadow of watchful Mum lying in wait with sardine sandwiches, they strove to be alone.<br>
<br>Rosenthal's own love-life had hardly been thriving. His marriage on 23 February 1964 to (Catherine) Maxine Ward, a 23-year-old fashion model and daughter of William Ward of Blackpool, lasted only two years, and never figured in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry. Now, at the Stables Theatre in Manchester, which in some ways was an annexe to Granada TV, he met and fell for the gifted young actress Maureen Diane Lipman (<i>b</i>. 1946), daughter of Maurice Julius Lipman, gentleman's outfitter of Kingston upon Hull, and his wife, Zelma. &#145;It was like coming home&#146;, Rosenthal said  (personal knowledge). They moved to London to work together, were married on 18 February 1973 at the West London Synagogue, and settled in Hampstead, while remaining northerners at heart&#151;or at least, in his case, a Manchester United supporter. They had a son, Adam, and a daughter, Amy.<br>
<br>Over the next twenty-five years Rosenthal turned out an astonishing volume of work, with forays into the theatre and cinema as well as television. A movie version of <span class="italic">The Lovers</span> appeared in 1973. A comedy of even younger love, <span class="italic">P'Tang, Yang, Kipperbang</span> (1982), was in response to a scheme devised by Channel 4 television, due to open later that year, whereby films would be commissioned for cinema release first, then transmission over the air. <span class="italic">The Devil's Lieutenant</span>, written to the same brief but as a co-production with German television, was a rarity from Rosenthal, a sombre period murder drama. Hollywood beckoned in the shape of an invitation from the American star Barbra Streisand to write with her, and for her, the quirky Jewish comedy <span class="italic">Yentl</span> (1983). The film won a New York critics' golden globe award, and might have been expected to establish him as a major Hollywood screenwriter. Though he went on to script, or contribute to, a dozen more big-screen projects, some of which were actually made, this transmogrification never quite came to pass.<br>
<br>On the stage Rosenthal's greatest success was with <span class="italic">Bar Mitzvah Boy</span> at Her Majesty's Theatre, in 1978, a musical version of what had started out as a television piece two years earlier. Drawing on his embarrassed but ultimately consoling memories of the rite of passage awaiting every Jewish boy, it was one of many semi-autobiographical works. <span class="italic">The Evacuees</span> (BBC, 1975) wrung its precarious comedy from his grisly wartime year in Blackpool. A generation on, <span class="italic">Eskimo Day</span> (1996) charted the mixed feelings of parents trying to steer their young through the hoops of university acceptance. The little comic masterpiece <span class="italic">Ready When You Are, Mr McGill</span> featured a twitchy television director shooting a cut-price film drama, just as Rosenthal would have overseen many times. Mr McGill was an elderly extra given one line to speak, and muffing it again and again. That had been in 1976, but in 2003 the play was given the rare compliment (for television) of a fresh production, which rather poignantly was also one of its author's final credits, along with an adaptation of Kingsley Amis's <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span>.<br>
<br>Although Rosenthal disliked long-running series, which for the writer, he said, meant running on the spot, he must have derived some security from those spun off from his work, especially if the spinning were delegated to others. The annals of a London fire station, <span class="italic">London's Burning</span>, were still cropping up in the schedules fifteen years after his 1986 play of the same name. <span class="italic">The Chain</span> (1984), about the ordeals of moving house, led to the 1994 series <span class="italic">Moving Story</span>. He and his family had themselves moved twice and were now in Muswell Hill, which lent a certain piquancy to a BBC commission about this time. The corporation wanted a play to mark the fiftieth anniversary of its launch of the world's first television service in 1936, and the original premises were still there in Alexandra Palace, just up the hill. <span class="italic">The Fools on the Hill</span> was a rare disappointment. The sheer audacity of the pioneers, tackling Shakespeare and grand opera in tiny cramped studios, was lost in their squabbles. Otherwise Rosenthal's output remained as vigorous as ever, despite the first intimations of cancer. Ever inventive, never failing to find rich comedy in every walk of life, he was justly dubbed television's Charles Dickens&#151;or, in the comparison Maureen Lipman preferred, its Jane Austen in his capacity to make ordinary people important.<br>
<br>Rosenthal's marriage to Maureen Lipman was both loving and practical. Sensibly she appeared only two or three times in his plays, but inspired and encouraged him at all times. Working at home, he was happy to take over the cooking and housework when she was busy rehearsing or filming. Companionably both were made CBE, he in 1994, she five years later. He died in the North London Hospice, 47 Woodside Avenue, Finchley, on 29 May 2004, of multiple myeloma, and was buried in Hoop Lane cemetery, Golders Green, London. He was survived by his wife, Maureen, and their two children.<br>
