</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Creed, Sir  Thomas Percival</span>  (1897&#150;1969), <span class="occ">lawyer and educationist</span>, was born in Leicester on 29 January 1897, the third son in the family of five children of the Revd Colin John Creed, curate of St Peter's, Leicester, and later rector of Farthinghoe, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Etheldreda Wright, daughter of Frederick Robert Spackman MD of Harpenden, Hertfordshire. He was educated at Wyggeston School, Leicester, joined the Artists' Rifles in 1915, and served in France with the Leicestershire regiment, being twice wounded and winning the MC (1917).<br>
<br>After demobilization in 1919 Creed was awarded a classical scholarship at Pembroke College, Oxford, taking third-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1922. He then entered the Sudan political service, and read for the bar while serving as assistant district commissioner in Berber Province (1923) and Darfur (1925). In 1926 he was seconded to the legal department of the Sudan government as district judge of the first grade and permanently transferred to this post in 1929, having in 1928 been called to the bar (Lincoln's Inn). In 1928 Creed married (Agnes) Margaret, elder daughter of Arthur Brewis, solicitor, of St Helens in Lancashire; they had one son (who also went into practice as a solicitor) and two daughters.<br>
<br>Creed was seconded to the Iraqi government under the Anglo-Iraqi judicial agreement in 1931. There, after a short period as additional judge in Baghdad, he served as president of the courts in Kirkuk (1932) and Mosul (1934) before returning to Sudan as a judge of the high court, Khartoum, in 1935. He was appointed chief justice of Sudan in 1936, and legal secretary, with a seat on the governor-general's council, in 1941. He was awarded the order of the Nile, second class, in 1939, appointed CBE in 1943, and KBE in 1946. In 1947 he was chief representative of the Sudan government at the hearing of the Anglo-Egyptian dispute by the Security Council at Lake Success.<br>
<br>Shortly before his retirement from Sudan in 1948 Creed took silk, but preferred to seek an educational career, like other members of his family. One of his brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32624/', "John Martin Creed")</script>, had been Ely professor of divinity at Cambridge, and another, (Richard) Stephen, a fellow of New College, Oxford. Their sister, Mary, was a lecturer at Aberystwyth College (University of Wales), and the fourth brother, Edward, a senior pathologist at King's College Hospital. Thomas Creed became secretary to King's College, London, in 1948, and principal of Queen Mary College in 1952, a post he was to hold for fifteen years. From 1964 to 1967 he was vice-chancellor of London University.<br>
<br>During this period Creed also served as chairman of the Medical Appeal Tribunal under the <span class="roman">National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act</span>, chairman of the committee of inquiry into the administration of the Forest of Dean (1955), chairman of the Burnham committee for the assessment of pay scales for teachers (1958&#150;64), and chairman of Oxford House social settlement in Bethnal Green. He was made an honorary fellow of Pembroke in 1950, a freeman of the Drapers' Company (with which Queen Mary College had close ties) in 1963, an honorary LLD of Leicester in 1965, and an honorary bencher of Lincoln's Inn, a distinction which he prized especially highly, in 1967. He was also a member of the education committee of the Goldsmiths' Company.<br>
<br>The key to Creed's character lay in his unswerving integrity. As chief justice he could forgive an error of judgement but admit no excuse for careless or slipshod behaviour in a magistrate, however hard-worked he might be. As legal secretary he regarded himself as a watchdog for the Sudanese people, ensuring that their constitutional rights were not infringed and firmly refusing to agree to any project, however well-intentioned, for which no clear legal authority existed. As adviser to the governor-general, and as his representative from time to time in his absence, he would not tolerate evasion, or failure to clarify the true nature and purpose of any proposed act or policy. He would have disliked being a professional diplomat or a politician, and to the end of his life he was accustomed to use the correspondence columns of <span class="italic">The Times</span> to convey trenchant and uninhibited criticism of the policy of the British government in Middle Eastern affairs.<br>
<br>Creed's headship of Queen Mary College happily coincided with a period of expansion; he took full advantage of this, trebling the size of the student body and providing the college with a whole range of new buildings. He resisted for some time pressure to let his name go forward for the vice-chancellorship, although he served as deputy vice-chancellor from 1958 to 1961, but his supporters finally convinced him, in 1963, that his leadership and wisdom were needed at a time when the future of London University had become a live issue. Creed firmly believed that the particular excellence of the university lay in retaining its broadly based federal structure. He was among those who feared that the threat of an independent commission of inquiry into the future of the university might lead to its premature dismemberment or to a regrouping which would result in a loss of the identity of some of its smaller institutions. The threat was not averted, but Creed's work, in close accord with the officers of the Senate House, did not go unrewarded, for the outcome of the independent inquiry left the federation intact.<br>
<br>As <span class="italic">The Times</span> said on his death, Creed:<blockquote>seemed to embody everything that is excellent in the law &hellip; He was the embodiment of impartiality; he had a deep and abiding concern for the rights of individuals; yet he was determined that decisions, once taken, should be strictly and honourably carried out. (13 May 1969)</blockquote>He seldom minced his words. His strictures were devastating, without respect of persons, but where he considered praise deserved, he bestowed it unstintingly. Creed died at his home, 18 Wynnstay Gardens, Allen Street, London, on 11 May 1969.<br>
