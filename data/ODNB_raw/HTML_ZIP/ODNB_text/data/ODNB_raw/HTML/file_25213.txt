</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharp,  John</span>  (1645?&#150;1714), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was born at Ivegate, Bradford, probably on 16 February 1645, the eldest of five children. His father was Thomas Sharp, a wet and dry salter; his mother, Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Weddal, was the eldest daughter of John Weddal of Widdington, Yorkshire. The Sharps were a well-established Yorkshire family, mainly clothiers and farmers on a small scale. Sharp was baptized in Bradford parish church by an episcopally ordained minister, a fact which gave him great satisfaction in later life: by that time in the civil war the officiant might not have received episcopal ordination, and so would have been regarded by Sharp as a layman. Sharp's father was a devout puritan and a parliamentarian follower of Sir Thomas Fairfax and his mother an Anglican and royalist. Sharp admired his father's piety but was more influenced by his mother's devotion to the prayer book. He was educated at Bradford grammar school and in 1660 entered Christ's College, Cambridge. In 1663 he graduated BA and thereupon concentrated on the study of divinity; he proceeded MA in 1667, though he failed to gain a fellowship.<h2>
<a name="RectorofStGilesintheFieldsanddeanofNorwich"></a>Rector of St Giles-in-the-Fields and dean of Norwich</h2>That year Sharp was ordained deacon and priest at the same service by special dispensation. At Cambridge he had been influenced by Henry More, who recommended him as chaplain and tutor to Sir Heneage Finch, then solicitor-general and later lord chancellor. Finch gained Sharp promotion to the archdeaconry of Berkshire in 1673 and, in 1675, to a prebend in Norwich and to the London parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields. In this important cure he was to remain for sixteen years, until he became archbishop of York. In April 1676 Sharp married Elizabeth Palmer of a well-known Lincolnshire family, the ceremony being performed by his friend and neighbour at St Lawrence Jewry, John Tillotson. In common with other rising London clergymen, Sharp now devoted himself to the hard-working life of a model parish priest. He fully shared the parochial visiting in this mainly poor and malodorous area with his two or three curates; about his preaching he took immense pains, preparing &#145;the diction as well as the matter&#146;, to avoid, as Gilbert Burnet (who reckoned him a good preacher) said, any danger of &#145;flatness&#146;  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.39&#150;40). His son and biographer said of his preaching that &#145;his great excellence lay in representing the truths of religion with such plainness and unaffected simplicity as was &hellip; very persuasive and affecting&#146;  (ibid., 1.24). With preaching went catechizing, in which he excelled owing to his &#145;very kind, warm way of talking&#146; on religious matters  (ibid., 1.45). In 1681 Sharp was nominated to the deanery of Norwich, which he held in tandem with his London rectory. He instituted an inquiry into the revenues of the cathedral, but seems mainly to have seen Norwich as providing the opportunity &#145;of improving in his spiritual life through the advantages of retirement and disengagement from company and business which Norwich afforded him&#146;  (ibid., 1.51).<br>
<br>Back in London, Sharp fell foul of the new Roman Catholic king. In common with many others he was concerned to refute Roman Catholicism. For him this took the form of a series of sermons at St Giles's starting in May 1686. The king commanded Henry Compton, the bishop of London, to suspend him from preaching. This Compton felt he could not do, because Sharp had not been properly tried for his offence; but he &#145;advised him to forbear the pulpit&#146;  (<span class="italic">King James's Ecclesiastical Commission</span>, 20). Compton was summoned before the recently created ecclesiastical commission and, when he insisted that the king could not command something which was unlawful, he was suspended and the diocese put into commission. Compton had proved himself a thorn in the royal flesh on several occasions, and it is clear that the king used the Sharp incident to engineer his downfall. In 1687 Sharp continued with his series of sermons without hindrance, demonstrating that he had been a pawn in a higher game.<br>
<br>Sharp also engaged himself in controversy at the other end of the ecclesiastical spectrum. In 1684 he produced his only written work. This was a pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Conscience</span>, which in 1686 was incorporated into a two-volume <span class="italic">Collection of cases &hellip; written to recover dissenters to the communion of the Church of England</span>, contributed by leading Anglicans. After a casuistical examination of the nature of conscience Sharp applies his findings to the separation of dissenters from the church. Here he takes a typical high-church standpoint, emphasizing the seriousness of separation and schism. If a dissenter feels it would actually be sinful for him to join the established church, then continued separation is permissible; but there are other reasons for separation, such as education, friendship, or force of habit, which are not excusable. Those who practise occasional conformity but remain outside the church are doing so for worldly reasons: &#145;with what conscience dare they do it at all?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 40). Sharp makes a powerful case and one which was obviously heartfelt. His thinking was not Erastian, but rather based on Augustine and Aquinas. The former had believed that schismatics should be &#145;compelled to enter&#146; the church, a tactic which many high-churchmen after the Restoration favoured; the latter, closely followed by Sharp, had differentiated between various operations of conscience. In Sharp &#145;a high church sensibility, authoritarian yet plainly pastoral, prevailed over erastian arguments&#146;  (Goldie, &#145;The theory of religious intolerance&#146;, 358).<br>
<br>Sharp took no immediate part in the invitation to William to come to England, but in January 1689 he was involved in London meetings to discuss the complicated permutations of the constitutional settlement. On 30 January 1689 he preached before the House of Commons and prayed for King James, which was legally correct. Two days earlier the Commons had passed the bill pronouncing the abdication of James and the consequent vacancy of the throne, but the bill had not yet gone through the Lords. Nevertheless, it was a courageous act on Sharp's part, and the Commons were duly&#151;though temporarily&#151;incensed. At this time of dynastic confusion the state prayers were something of a litmus test for the clergy, and it may have been that, in praying for James, Sharp was intending to reserve his position for as long as possible.<br>
<br>Two issues important for the constitution of the established church were debated in the revolution settlement&#151;comprehension in the church to encourage dissenters to enter its fold, and toleration for those who continued to refuse. Moves to comprehension suffered an early blow when, after a disastrously tactless speech from the throne from William, who did not understand the English ecclesiastical scene, parliament threw out the proposals in March 1689. But a commission was appointed to prepare proposals for comprehension to be presented to convocation. Sharp was one of ten bishops and twenty dignitaries appointed to this commission. The preamble to its instructions struck an eirenic note, granting that in matters &#145;indifferent&#146; in church affairs &#145;changes and alterations should be made therein, as to those that are in place and authority, should from time to time seem either necessary or expedient&#146;  (T. Birch, <span class="italic">Tillotson</span>, 1783, 180). That said, the nonconformists were to be presented with an Anglican <i>fait accompli</i>, rather than being involved in the discussions. These centred mainly on the alterations to the liturgy, rather than on the review of the canons and the reform of the church courts. There was evidently no discussion of the thorny issue of nonconformist ordinations. However, the plans were scotched by the high-churchmen in convocation after Sharp had failed to engineer the election of Tillotson as prolocutor. William immediately adjourned convocation, which did not meet again for ten years. Although some high-churchmen at the time were averse to any scheme of comprehension which involved compromise&#151;as introducing schism into the church itself&#151;it may be assumed, because of his efforts in convocation, that Sharp approved the plans.<br>
<br>This left the <span class="roman">Toleration Bill</span> which had been proceeding through parliament. When it passed it was not as &#145;liberal&#146; as some might have hoped, partly because it had originally been drafted to deal with hard-core dissenters who had refused the comprehension offer. Sharp may not have regretted this. In 1694 when Archbishop Tenison tried briefly to revive the comprehension issue he asked Sharp for his copy of the earl of Nottingham's 1689 papers&#151;the Finch connection again.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofYork"></a>Archbishop of York</h2>Sharp was one of the seven senior clergymen recommended by Burnet, William's chief ecclesiastical adviser, for early promotion to bishoprics. However, because of his refusal to take a see made vacant by a nonjuror (Norwich was the obvious suggestion, but he would not fill the shoes of his friend the nonjuring Bishop William Lloyd) this promotion was delayed. Instead, in September 1689 he became dean of Canterbury, John Tillotson having become archbishop. But when Archbishop Thomas Lamplugh of York died, the way was open for Sharp, and on 5 July 1691 he was consecrated archbishop by Tillotson. While his friend was at Canterbury the two archbishops worked harmoniously together. For example in 1692 when Tillotson launched a programme of clerical reform Sharp was included in the consultation. Once in York, Sharp set about his work in a typically thorough manner, starting with the compilation of a four-volume survey of the diocese. A feature of his long reign of twenty-two years was that with two exceptions, unlike other bishops, he steadily refused to grant lucrative offices to well-connected suitors; rather, he promoted worthy clergymen from within the diocese to prebendal stalls or to the major parishes at his disposal. The exceptions were his two former pupils, the sons of his patron, now Lord Nottingham. Henry Finch was appointed in 1695 to the richest prebendal stall in the minster. Sharp hoped to promote him to the deanery but was twice thwarted by the king. Finally, in 1704 Henry achieved the deanery, to be succeeded in his stall by his brother, Edward. Sharp refused to become involved in parliamentary elections, and would give no guidance in the matter to his clergy. Instead he concentrated on the pastoral and administrative aspects of his work. Lamplugh had been seventy-six when he died, and consequently the diocese was not in very good shape when Sharp succeeded.<br>
<br>The keystone to more vigorous administration was Sharp's use of his triennial visitations, following in the footsteps of the annual visitations of the archdeacons. He could also mount metropolitan visitations in the three dioceses of the province, especially when these were <i>sede vacante</i>. Sharp was as punctilious as possible in this work, though weakness in his later years made it difficult; also, it was confined to the six months in which he was resident in the diocese, roughly from Easter to the early autumn when his parliamentary and other duties called him back to London. In May 1693 Sharp undertook a visitation of the collegiate church of Southwell, where it was clear that discipline and administration had become very slack. He asked a detailed and searching set of questions and received evasive answers. In March 1694 he returned with a fierce set of injunctions, especially concerning absenteeism and the dilapidations on the chapter property. These were not popular but were obeyed and continued in force. A set of visitation articles for the diocese of Chester <i>sede vacante</i> show Sharp at his best: they follow much the same lines as those in other dioceses but are more detailed and specific, especially on the questions concerning property and residence. Moreover the preliminary &#145;Advertisement&#146; is unusual: the parson and churchwardens are to meet &#145;divers times to deliberate and confer about&#146; the articles and to answer &#145;particularly, advisedly and truly according to their consciences&#146;  (Borth. Inst., V.1707/visitation papers). Thus Sharp turned an inquisition into a pastoral opportunity.<br>
<br>In other aspects of his episcopal ministry Sharp &#145;set a signal example of personal care and devotion to public duty&#146;  (N. Sykes, <span class="italic">Church and State in the Eighteenth Century</span>, 1934, 105). He was concerned to make ordination a properly solemn ceremony and to ensure that no one unsuitable was admitted to orders. He fought against pluralism and non-residence; he exercised his own patronage with great care, and set his face against simony. Once his clergy were in post Sharp showed much concern about their problems and performance, as witness hundreds of surviving letters dispensing advice, encouragement, and patient reprimand. He was particularly concerned about the further education of the clergy and often made small grants from his own pocket for the purchase of books, typical of his many acts of generosity, which centred on the hospitality he provided at Bishopthorpe. He was a frequent weekday attender at his own cathedral and also set up and attended weekly sermons in York which were given by clergy from all over the diocese; the preacher was asked to dinner at Bishopthorpe afterwards and submitted to a tutorial from his archbishop. He found that the administration of confirmation in the diocese had been particularly neglected and set about redressing this, at the same time encouraging the bishops in the three other dioceses to follow his example. He was also concerned with the oversight of schools, taking pains over the appointment of schoolmasters, monitoring statutes, and giving sensible advice about the regime for pupils.<br>
<br>Sharp envisaged a larger role for the rural deans than would have obtained in most dioceses. In 1705 he issued rules and orders for them. They were to have a supervisory function in their deaneries, granting matrimonial licenses, reporting vacancies and dilapidations, annually collecting and returning parish registers, and notifying the church courts of scandalous offenders who had escaped being presented. In many ways this would have added a local tier to diocesan administration.<br>
<br>However, in the end it was the church courts which were responsible for enforcing discipline and good order in the diocese. They had not been reformed at the Restoration or again in 1689. Sharp had had a ringside view of this failure, which evidently continued to rankle with him. He believed that the Church of England was the best church in Christendom, but recognized its weakness in the field of discipline, &#145;which had never been effectually provided for&#146;  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.355). He had long been troubled about his own courts: he tried to stop the practice of commuting penances, and he issued instructions that the sentence of excommunication was to be delayed as long as possible. Matters came to a head in 1698 when serious accusations of malpractice were made against the deputy register of the exchequer (testamentary) court. This led Sharp to mount a visitation of his courts, probably the only one in the Church of England after the Restoration. He issued cautious articles of inquiry; only the close examination of the practice of deputy registers, who could also be busy proctors in other diocesan courts, revealed the fact that he was seeking the root of corruption. When they came in, the replies from the court officers&#151;from the chancellor, Henry Watkinson, downwards&#151;were vague and evasive. One thing they seem to show is the inbred conservatism of the courts. Sharp continued to have meetings with Watkinson and others until 1705, but in the end he had to admit defeat. It was no doubt this bruising experience which in 1710 led him to propose various reforms for the Canterbury convocation to consider, all to no avail. The decline of the courts in the period before the revolution, capped by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> legitimizing the practice of dissent, meant that the Church of England could no longer pretend to exercise spiritual discipline across the country.<br>
<br>This was the context for the societies for the reformation of manners. Founded by a layman, these societies embraced churchmen and dissenters. Through lectures and by direct action against vice in the church and secular courts, the societies sought to roll back the tide, as they saw it, of vice. The movement was endorsed by both William and Mary and received the support of Tenison and most of the &#145;whig&#146; bishops. Not so Sharp: &#145;he always disliked and discouraged &hellip; the Societies for the Reformation of Manners&#146;  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.170). He felt that the presence of dissenters in the meetings was in danger of turning them into illegal conventicles, and he disliked the element of witch-hunting in place of genuine reformation of character. When a society was established by Nottinghamshire clergy he moved at once to control it, insisting that it must be &#145;modest, prudent and inoffensive&#146; in its work  (ibid., 1.173). But he tolerated other societies in the diocese where they were composed only of churchmen.<br>
<br>In 1702 William Nicolson became the bishop of Carlisle, and this led in time to the most difficult confrontation between the archbishop and one of his three suffragans that Sharp had to deal with. Nicolson had started life as a tory but at Carlisle became more of a whig. When the high-flying tory gadfly Francis Atterbury was appointed dean of Carlisle in 1704, the sparks were set to fly. Nicolson and Atterbury were old enemies, Nicolson having written against Atterbury's position on the powers of convocation. Nicolson now refused to institute Atterbury &#145;unless he first revoked certain propositions relating to the royal supremacy, which might seem to be deducible from his convocation book&#146;  (N. Sykes, <span class="italic">Edmund Gibson</span>, 1926, 58). Tenison backed Nicolson, but the tory bishops, including Sharp, by this time clearly on the tory side, were behind Atterbury. Nicolson continued to refuse to institute Atterbury, deducing from the Carlisle statutes that he had the same power over the dean (on institution) as over &#145;the meanest vicar in my diocese&#146;  (Glos. RO, L-B-S MSS, box 4, bundle V.1). Sharp, to save Nicolson's face, offered to institute Atterbury himself under commission from Nicolson. Nicolson refused and summoned Atterbury to Carlisle from Bishopthorpe to discuss the matter. Sharp now tried to get Sir Robert Harley to persuade Anne to intervene. When she did so Nicolson had to institute Atterbury. The vice-dean, Hugh Todd, had been Atterbury's supporter in Carlisle, and this led to further trouble for Sharp. Todd was in dispute with Nicolson and was not slow to involve Sharp over his bishop's head. By his patient intervention and eventual strictness with Todd, Sharp calmed the troubled waters. Meanwhile Atterbury had made himself obnoxious in Carlisle, and the chapter urged Nicolson to visit the cathedral. Atterbury retorted that, as Carlisle was a royal foundation at the Reformation, the bishop had no right of visitation. Tenison rightly saw that this was a matter of national importance, and when Nicolson introduced a bill to declare Henry VIII's statutes valid the whig bishops supported it. Sharp did not feel he could do so and there was a heated debate in the Lords in January 1708 which Nicolson won. On 28 March Nicolson, who was afraid Sharp had been seeing Todd, called on his archbishop: he &#145;received me very kindly desiring that our warmth in the House of Lords might be mutually forgotten&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 19, 28). Thus, in a typical act of magnanimity, ended a struggle which must have caused Sharp much pain, and in which he had to admit defeat.<h2>
<a name="Thearchbishopandthenation"></a>The archbishop and the nation</h2>Sharp was the only one of the seven churchmen recommended by Burnet to William for bishoprics who was consistently a high-churchman and usually on the side of the tories in parliament. But in the early years of William's reign he was able to work with his brother bishops. In 1694 he was appointed to a new commission to oversee church affairs, especially episcopal promotions. He was however moving away from his colleagues, typically when he refused to support William's desire for the attainder and execution of the Jacobite Sir John Fenwick. After this &#145;he virtually ceased lending his support to the ecclesiastical commission&#146;, though Tenison continued to send him the papers  (Bennett, &#145;King William III and the episcopate&#146;, 127). With the accession of Anne everything changed. It was soon clear that Sharp was her favourite cleric. At her insistence, and despite illness, Sharp preached her coronation sermon, taking the classic text &#145;kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers&#146;  (J. Sharp, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd at the Coronation of Queen Anne</span>, 1702, 1). Anne &#145;leaned upon the spiritual counsel and friendship of &hellip; Sharp and in his Caroline piety she found much comfort&#146;  (Bennett, <span class="italic">White Kennett</span>, 113). From her side Anne expressed the relationship as that &#145;I should be her confessor and she would be mine&#146;  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.300). This hardly makes Sharp her &#145;confessor&#146; in the technical sense, but he was certainly at her side as she prepared for the sacrament. Anne took her duties as head of the church very seriously and felt that the high-flyers' cry of &#145;the church in danger&#146; was a personal insult. However, this sense of duty carried with it obligations for Sharp. She expected him and others not to vote against her interests in the Lords:<blockquote>she pressed me earnestly to be on her side on all matters that came before parliament relating to the prerogative &hellip; she desired that I would never promise my vote, till I had acquainted her with my objection &hellip; but if she could not satisfy me, then I should vote as I pleased. (ibid., 1.300)</blockquote>This undertaking Sharp was glad to give.<br>
<br>The most serious clash between Sharp and his queen came over the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. Churchmen saw that the union between England and Scotland raised potential problems for the Church of England as the established church in England. In 1702 Tenison and Sharp were appointed to a commission to think this through, though in the event Sharp never attended. Tenison brought in a bill &#145;for the security of the Church of England&#146; guaranteeing its traditional constitutional place  (Carpenter, 393). Sharp felt the bill was not sufficient protection because the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> pronounced that &#145;Scottish religion is the true protestant religion and the presbyterian government is necessary&#146;, so that it &#145;cut off all the hopes of the episcopal clergy&#146;  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.393). Anne, who was set on the union, urged Sharp to drop his opposition, but he, with the tory bishops, refused. However, it passed. Sharp had also been concerned about individual episcopalian clergymen in Scotland and from 1704 was distressed to hear of actual persecution in Edinburgh and elsewhere. Accordingly he did his best to forward the cause of toleration in Scotland. The close alliance between Anne and Sharp was most clearly expressed in ecclesiastical appointments; for much of the time of their partnership they worked with Harley, the great parliamentary fixer, though Harley's position varied according to the ministerial permutations of the time. The candidates were mainly Sharp's, but on occasions Anne did not hesitate to exercise her prerogative. Sharp's appointments were mainly moderate high-churchmen. But the triumvirate did not have it all their own way, and Godolphin, the lord treasurer, often opposed them on behalf of the whigs, in 1705, for instance, getting William Wake to Lincoln against Sharp's candidate, Sir William Dawes. Matters came to a head in 1706 with the so-called &#145;bishoprics crisis&#146;. Exeter and Chester were vacant, and Sharp had his candidates accepted. Godolphin was furious, and threatened that the whigs would withdraw from the ministry if Anne did not change her mind. Face was saved by a vacancy at Ely to which John Moore, a whig, was appointed. Lord Somers blamed these defeats on Tenison: &#145;the Archbishop is principally at fault, who does not speak plainly and fully to the Queen, when the Archbishop of York never suffers her to rest&#146;  (Bennett, &#145;Bishoprics crisis&#146;, 738). In the fluid politics of the time the episcopal vote in the Lords was important, and Godolphin lost patience, writing to Anne:<blockquote>what reflection will it not cause in the world that all these weighty things (of state) together cannot stand in the balance with the single point of whether Dr Blackall at this time be made a bishop, or a dean or a prebend. (Gregg, 249)</blockquote>One earlier outcome of struggles between church and state had been the foundation of Queen Anne's Bounty in 1704. The original idea had been Burnet's, but the actual proposal had been Harley's, to regain favour with the clergy after the failure of the high-church <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span>. By it the crown was to surrender the proceeds of tenths and first-fruits on ecclesiastical appointments to create a fund to augment poor livings, something which would be dear to Sharp's heart: &#145;I find the Archbishop of York is highly transported with your notion about the firstfruits&#146;, wrote Godolphin to Harley  (Longleat, miscellaneous vol., fol. 84). In due time Sharp, who had been involved in the plan since its inception, threw his weight behind the bill, against whig opposition, and for once carried all the bishops with him.<br>
<br>A recurrent issue on which Sharp differed from his low-church brethren was that of occasional conformity. Sharp disliked the practice of occasional conformity, considering it dishonest when it was used to procure advancement in political life, though tolerable when it expressed Christian charity, as when Richard Baxter communicated at St Giles's. But in 1704 the tories attempted to steer their bill banning the practice through the Lords by tacking it to a finance bill after it had twice been defeated by the whig peers; Sharp felt this was a shabby manoeuvre and used all his influence to get it defeated in the Commons. The matter was again revived&#151;this time with his support&#151;in 1711 when the bill against occasional conformity was passed.<br>
<br>All this time relations between Sharp and Tenison, who was painfully shy and suffering from gout, deteriorated steadily. Matters came openly to a head in 1712 over the question of lay baptism. High-flying clergy, including Henry Dodwell, had attacked the validity of baptism by a layman. Tenison informally gathered together some bishops, including Sharp, who issued a declaration that lay baptism was to be discouraged but was not invalid&#151;the classic &#145;Catholic&#146; doctrine. Tenison then went further and drew up an instruction to the clergy that they should not rebaptize. This he sent to Sharp for approval. Sharp, with his high-church episcopal colleagues William Dawes of Chester, Offspring Blackall of Exeter, and Philip Bisse of St David's, demurred and replied to Tenison:<blockquote>I can by no means come into that proposal your grace has now made in your letter &hellip; for I am afraid that it would be too great an encouragement to the Dissenters to go on their way of irregular uncanonical baptisms. (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.376)</blockquote>Burnet says that Sharp was &#145;prevailed on to change his mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.605). But it was one thing for some bishops to assent to an informal declaration and another to take it forward to a formal instruction to all the clergy. The incident also demonstrates that towards the end of his life Sharp was hardening in his attitude to dissenters, though he disapproved of their being &#145;vilified&#146; in Anglican pulpits  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.357).<br>
<br>Nevertheless Sharp did not fail to respond to appeals from foreign protestants distressed by the fortunes of war, such as the Vaudois clergy and those of the Palatinate. But his most regular foreign contacts were with the Lutherans in Prussia and Hanover. In 1711 he worked with George Smalridge, a friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute; who later wrote his Latin epitaph in York Minster, to get the English liturgy used at the court of Hanover. But despite the potential importance of the move it came to nothing. In Prussia Daniel Ernst Jablonski hoped to introduce a translated English liturgy into the court chapel of Frederick I. He sought to interest Tenison in the plans, but for some reason Tenison failed to respond. Jablonski persisted and embarked on a lengthy correspondence with Sharp through the good offices of Smalridge. Sharp was always concerned to move the thinking forward from the use of the Anglican liturgy to questions of order, that is, episcopacy. This Jablonski espoused in a treatise on episcopacy in 1711. Despite correspondence the scheme ran into the sands in 1712.<br>
<br>Sharp's last illness began in December 1713. A visit to Bath did nothing to revive him and he died there on 2 February 1714; his wife survived him. He was buried in his cathedral at York, in St Mary's Chapel, where he had been archbishop for twenty-two years. Sharp and his wife had fourteen children, seven of each sex, of whom only two sons and two daughters survived him. The elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47277/', "John Sharp")</script>, became MP for Ripon and was a high-flying tory. The younger, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25220/', "Thomas Sharp")</script>, was ordained and became successively chaplain to Archbishop Dawes at York and archdeacon of Northumberland; he was his father's biographer, having access to his diaries which were subsequently lost. Sharp's chief recreation was as a numismatist. As such he was friendly with the York antiquary Ralph Thoresby, to whom he left his coin collection. Sharp was largely responsible for Thoresby's conversion from dissent. He was also very interested in his gardens at Bishopthorpe, where latterly he spent much time in prayer, calling them his &#145;Temple of Praise&#146;  (Sharp, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.65). Sharp was undoubtedly a man of deep personal piety. Besides his daily devotions he regularly dedicated 24 June, which he reckoned his spiritual birthday, to solemn prayer and self-examination. This custom went back to 1688 about which his diary reads: &#145;I began to apply myself more diligently to the work of religion and spent the summer well. And I thank God most heartily that I have never relapsed&#146;  (ibid., 2.65). These strenuous days of devotion (together with his birthday and new year's day) continued until 1713, when his health began to fail.<br>
