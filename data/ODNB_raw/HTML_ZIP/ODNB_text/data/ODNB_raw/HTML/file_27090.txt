</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  Tom</span>  (1817&#150;1880), <span class="occ">playwright and comic writer</span>, was born on 19 October 1817 in Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, Durham, the second son of Thomas Taylor (1769&#150;1843) and his wife, Maria Josephina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Arnold (1784&#150;1858). His father rose from farm labourer in Cumberland to partner in a brewery, and his mother was of German ancestry. After attending Sunderland Grange School, Taylor proceeded in 1832 to the University of Glasgow, where he received numerous awards. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1837, was elected to a scholarship in 1838, and graduated BA in 1840 as junior optime in mathematics, being in the first class in the classical tripos. According to John Sheehan, Taylor was &#145;the life of his College, and at the head of the intellectual fun of Trinity&#146;  (Sheehan, 148). A member of the University Reform Club, and one of the Apostles, Taylor organized theatricals, and wrote for the Liberal <span class="italic">Cambridge Independent</span>, and for the short-lived <span class="italic">Cambridge University Magazine</span>. Elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1842, he proceeded MA in 1843.<br>
<br>Taylor moved to London in 1844, where he served as professor of English at the University of London in 1845 and 1846, kept his terms at the Inner Temple, was called to the bar on 20 November 1846, and established himself as a dramatist and writer. Between 1844 and 1846, the Lyceum Theatre staged at least seven Taylor plays, including burlesques written with Albert Smith and with Charles Kenney, and his first major success, the 1846 comedy <span class="italic">To Parents and Guardians</span>. He was also composing leaders for the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, and writing for <span class="italic">Douglas Jerrold's Illuminated Magazine</span> and for the comic publication <span class="italic">Puck</span>. With his first contribution to <span class="italic">Punch</span> on 19 October 1844, he began a thirty-six year association with the magazine, which ended only with his death.<br>
<br>Taylor made the northern circuit until 1850 when he became assistant secretary of the Board of Health. On its reorganization in 1854, he was appointed secretary, and when its functions were transferred to the local government act office in 1858, Taylor moved too. (He would retire in 1872.) During the 1850s he wrote or co-wrote over thirty comedies, extravaganzas, burlesques, farces, and pantomimes. Most notable were the comedies written with Charles Reade, including <span class="italic">Masks and Faces</span> in 1852, <span class="italic">Two Loves and a Life</span> and <span class="italic">The King's Rival</span> in 1854, and <span class="italic">The First Printer</span> in 1856. <span class="italic">Still Waters Run Deep</span>, his 1855 adaptation of a Charles Bernard novelette, was a success for the Olympic Theatre, and his Haymarket comedies included <span class="italic">Victims</span> in 1857 and <span class="italic">The Contested Election</span> in 1859. <span class="italic">Our American Cousin</span>, the play Abraham Lincoln was watching when assassinated in 1865, was a transatlantic success in 1858, largely owing to Edward Askew Southern's performance as Lord Dundreary.<br>
<br>According to Winton Tolles, Taylor in 1860 was &#145;England's leading and most versatile living dramatist&#146;  (Tolles, 188). Despite twenty new productions in the following decade, however, his reputation would decline. <span class="italic">The Overland Route</span> was a success in 1860, and his 1863 melodrama <span class="italic">The Ticket of Leave Man</span> was Taylor's most popular play. The melodrama <span class="italic">Mary Warner</span> and the comedy <span class="italic">New Men and Old Acres</span> both pleased audiences in 1869, but his dramas do seem to be the work of the &#145;popular and transient Victorian playwright&#146; Tolles describes  (ibid., 220). In later years Taylor wrote a number of verse dramas on historical subjects, including <span class="italic">Twixt Axe and Crown</span> in 1870, <span class="italic">Jeanne Darc</span> in 1871, and <span class="italic">Anne Boleyn</span> in 1876.<br>
<br>Taylor was famous for drawing his plots from other plays and fictions, often French. Ellen Terry fondly called him &#145;Tom the Adapter&#146;  (Terry, 114), and his friend John Coleman admitted that the &#145;most successful works were not of native growth&#146;  (Coleman, 118). Others were less tolerant, and a lengthy public exchange occurred in 1871, when a profile in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> suggested that Taylor was virtually a plagiarist. Whether new or borrowed, though, his were some of Victorian England's most successful farces, sentimental comedies, melodramas, and historical plays.<br>
<br>The other great constant in Taylor's literary life was <span class="italic">Punch</span>. During the 1840s he averaged roughly three columns a month; in the 1850s and 1860s this output doubled. His contributions were generally humorous commentary or comic verses on politics, civic news, and the manners of the day. When the first editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, Mark Lemon, died in 1870, Taylor became an unofficial assistant editor to Shirley Brooks, and when Brooks himself died in 1874, Taylor succeeded him. Though according to M. H. Spielmann, the nineteenth-century historian of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, &#145;It cannot be said that his editorship was a success&#146;  (Spielmann, 340), R. G. G. Price finds it &#145;surprising to look at the paper he produced and see how much of it lives&#146;  (Price, 111). Sir John Tenniel and Gerald Du Maurier were still holding up the artistic side, and Francis Cowley Burnand, who would succeed Taylor as editor, was contributing to the textual side, though, especially during the summer, Taylor and Percival Leigh would find themselves writing almost the entire issue between them. What can perhaps be said is that while <span class="italic">Punch</span> easily survived Taylor's editorship, under him it became rather sombre and pompous.<br>
<br>As <span class="italic">The Times</span> art critic from 1857, and <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> art critic during the 1870s, Taylor was second only to John Ruskin in prominence. Many artists considered Taylor a kind-hearted philistine, fond of modest and sentimental pictures, and unsympathetic to innovation. When he testified during James Whistler's libel proceedings against Ruskin, for instance, Taylor described Whistler's paintings as only one step above delicately tinted wallpaper, earning him a place in that artist's <span class="italic">Gentle Art of Making Enemies</span>. Taylor edited the posthumous autobiographies of two artists: a rather unsympathetic <span class="italic">Life of Benjamin Robert Haydon</span> in 1853, and the highly favourable <span class="italic">Autobiographical Recollections by the Late Charles Robert Leslie</span> in 1860. In 1865 Taylor also completed and published Leslie's manuscript on the <span class="italic">Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds</span>.<br>
<br>Taylor was of middle height, bearded, with what John Coleman called &#145;a pugilistic jaw&#146; and &#145;eyes which glittered like steel&#146;  (Coleman, 2.117). Though Ellen Terry praised his &#145;generous, kindly nature&#146;  (Terry, 116), friends like Coleman remembered him as &#145;bumptious and dictatorial&#146;  (Coleman, 2.120). He was &#145;quick spoken and fidgety&#146;, Burnand recalled, &#145;mighty obstinate and not ordinarily ready to forgive and forget&#146;  (Burnand, 2.6, 228). Taylor's energy was legendary. An avid swimmer and rower, a talented amateur actor, and one of the Whitehall Civil Service rifle volunteers, he rose each day at 5 or 6 and wrote for three hours before taking an hour's brisk walk to his Whitehall office from the home he and his wife had built on Lavender Sweep, near Clapham Common, Wandsworth. He had married Laura Wilson Barker (<i>d</i>. 1905), the daughter of a Yorkshire clergyman, on 19 June 1855. She wrote music for Taylor's lyrics and plays, and composed her own orchestral works as well. The Taylors' two children, Laura Lucy Arnold and John Wycliffe, inherited their parents' artistic interests.<br>
<br>Lavender Sweep became a gathering place for politicians and artists, with Taylor serving as &#145;showman, stage manager, chief tumbler, leader of all the revels&#146;, as his friend Thomas Hughes put it  (Hughes, 299). Taylor's own politics were those of many <span class="italic">Punch</span> men. A strong Liberal and social reformer, he was nevertheless sceptical and dismissive of working-class movements. And while Spielmann finds &#145;a decidedly Radical, anti-Beaconsfield, anti-Imperial turn&#146; in the Taylor-edited <span class="italic">Punch</span>  (Spielmann, 99), Price claims that Taylor consciously strove to be more of a &#145;great Victorian&#146; than his <span class="italic">Punch</span> peers: &#145;As the record of his charitable enterprises and public functions extends, one feels he is turning into marble before one's eyes&#146;  (Price, 61).<br>
<br>Taylor's literary reputation has always been mixed. Tolles describes him as &#145;an industrious and sound workman who aimed not at greatness or permanency for himself or his work, but rather at satisfying the demands of the public he so well understood&#146;  (Tolles, 273). His <span class="italic">Punch</span> work, which Price describes as the &#145;result of long hours and grim determination&#146;  (Price, 69), is undistinguished. While admitting his &#145;punctuality, kindness of heart, open-handed charity, and thorough respectability&#146;, Edmund Yates, no friend of <span class="italic">Punch</span>, remarked that possessing &#145;such virtues does not qualify a man to be a contributor to a satirical journal&#146;  (Yates, 322). Arthur Adrian accurately claims that Taylor &#145;had a facile pen and could knock off a poem in an hour or two&#146;  (Adrian, 39), but Shirley Brooks's diary records an occasion when he asked Taylor &#145;for a <i>good</i> poem&#146; and was pleased to get back &#145;one better than usual&#146;  (Layard, 408&#150;9). Even Taylor's <span class="italic">Punch</span> obituary praised his industry and kindness, rather than his talent or wit.<br>
<br>Taylor died suddenly at his home, Lavender Sweep, Wandsworth, on 12 July 1880; he was buried in Brompton cemetery three days later.<br>
