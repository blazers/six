<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  William  Fettes</span>  (1822&#150;1891), <span class="occ">painter, antiquary, and curator</span>, was born in the parish of St Cuthbert, Edinburgh, on 29 March 1822, eldest son of Douglas James Douglas, accountant with the Commercial Bank of Scotland, and Martha Brook, great-niece of Sir William Fettes, bt, the founder of Fettes College. He was educated at the Southern Academy and the Royal High School in Edinburgh. In 1836 he took up a post as a clerk in the Commercial Bank where he remained for about ten years. During this period he resolved to become an artist and devoted his spare time to drawing and painting. However, his formal art training was limited: he enrolled at the Trustees' Academy for a few months in 1848 and attended the Royal Scottish Academy Life School for the 1851&#150;2 session. More informally, in 1848 he joined the Smashers' Club. This was a group of Edinburgh-based artists whose meetings combined sketching sessions and criticisms of each other's work with general drinking and socializing. As the members migrated south, the group re-formed in London in the 1860s and Fettes Douglas was an occasional visitor there. He also attended botany and anatomy classes at Edinburgh University. In addition he travelled with the painter Alexander Fraser to Warwickshire and the Lake District in 1851.<br>
<br>Fettes Douglas first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1845 and thereafter became a regular exhibitor. Although he showed portraits, figure studies, and a few landscapes to begin with, he very quickly immersed himself in historical, literary, and occult subjects. He frequently used the works of Shakespeare and Walter Scott as source material but picture titles show his wider interests, for example <span class="italic">Benvenuto Cellini Showing a Chased Salver</span> (1856; Hospitalfield House, Arbroath), <span class="italic">The Summons to the Secret Tribunal: an Incident in the Life of Vesalius the Great Anatomist</span> (1860; Perth Museum and Art Gallery), and <span class="italic">The Spell</span> (1864; National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh). His paintings were meticulously researched, particularly in the details of furnishings, costumes, and <i>objets d'art</i>. It is likely that he was influenced by Pre-Raphaelitism through Millais's painting <span class="italic">Mariana</span> (1851), which was exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1852. Unlike many of his Scottish contemporaries whose brushwork is characterized by a looseness and freedom of handling, Fettes Douglas relied on thin layers of oil carefully applied with linear precision. His paintings were signed with his monogram in the Douglas heart, usually painted in red.<br>
<br>In 1857 Fettes Douglas first visited Italy. This trip fostered his antiquarian interests and he began to collect coins and medals. His collection expanded to include costume, furniture, ceramics, glass, and silver and he used it in his paintings. He also acquired an important library which reflected his serious interest in history, particularly that of Scotland. After his death his collection of antiquities and fine art was sold at auction over four consecutive days and his library over five.<br>
<br>During the 1860s Fettes Douglas travelled widely in Europe and in 1866&#150;7 he made a lengthy journey through France, Italy, and Sicily. Not only did his travels feed his antiquarian imagination but he also began to paint his immediate surroundings. For example <span class="italic">On a Housetop, Rome</span> (1871; Royal Bank of Scotland) is one of a series of paintings of contemporary Italian subjects. Later in his career he turned increasingly to landscape, for example <span class="italic">The Village of the Water of Leith from a Window in Rothesay Terrace</span> (1879; Edinburgh City Museums and Art Galleries), painted on a strong vertical format. In the late 1870s, due to ill health, he began painting in watercolours, particularly landscapes, for example <span class="italic">On the Shores of the Lake of Menteith</span> (1887; Dundee Museums and Art Galleries).<br>
<br>Fettes Douglas was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1851, and an academician in 1854. He was involved with the raising of the Artists' company of the City of Edinburgh artillery volunteers in 1859. During the late 1860s he served as a visitor to the Royal Scottish Academy Life School and from 1869 to 1870 was the academy's secretary. In 1877 he was appointed curator of the National Gallery of Scotland but he resigned in 1882 in order to become president of the Royal Scottish Academy, a position he retained until his death. In 1880 he married Marion Barclay Grahame (<i>c</i>.1836&#150;1916), the second daughter of Baron Grahame of Morphie; they had no children. He was knighted on 17 May 1882 at Windsor Castle. Fettes Douglas died at Monkswell, Abdie, near Newburgh, Fife, on 20 July 1891. After a funeral in Edinburgh his body was taken by train to St Cyrus, Kincardineshire, for burial in the Barclay family plot on 28 July.<br>
