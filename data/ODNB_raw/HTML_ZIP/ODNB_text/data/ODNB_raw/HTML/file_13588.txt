<span class="headword">Holmes,  Abraham</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">army officer and conspirator</span>, was perhaps from co. Durham, though it has been suggested that he was related to a Holmes family of Sussex. Nothing definite is known of his background. He first appears during the early years of the civil war as a lieutenant in Robert Lilburne's regiment of arquebusiers in the parliamentarian army of Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, in Yorkshire. In 1646 Holmes was a captain in Lilburne's foot regiment in the New Model Army and in the following year was prominent as one of its regimental agitators. From August 1648 to March 1650 Holmes served with the regiment, now under the command of Sir Arthur Hesilrige, at Newcastle and Tynemouth. In June 1650 Holmes's foot company formed part of the new regiment under George Monck, and by August, Holmes, who was reputedly a Baptist by faith, had risen to the rank of major. He fought in Scotland that same year and was eventually appointed JP for Edinburgh and Haddingtonshire.<br>
<br>In December 1654 Holmes was approached by the ringleaders of what became known as Overton's plot, who expected him to mobilize those disaffected with the protectorate among Monck's officers. Instead Holmes revealed their plans to Monck, who sent him to London for further interrogation. Convinced of his loyalty, Cromwell returned Holmes to Scotland. In July 1659 the restored Rump promoted Holmes to lieutenant-colonel of Roger Sawrey's regiment stationed at Ayr. In December of that year, in anticipation of Monck's purge of unreliable officers, Holmes joined Sawrey in a futile attempt to hold Ayr for the army in England. Holmes eventually fled to Carlisle, but was displaced from the army in early 1660.<br>
<br>Holmes remained an outspoken republican and nonconformist following the Restoration, keeping company with London's disaffected. In 1664 he was arrested at a tavern near the Exchange for his alleged involvement in a plot to raise a rebellion with Dutch arms. He was imprisoned without trial in Windsor Castle for at least three years. The date of his release is unknown, but he was active in whig circles in the early 1680s. In 1681 Holmes hid the earl of Argyll, who had escaped from Edinburgh where he was being held for high treason. In August 1682 Argyll fled to the Netherlands, and Holmes remained his agent in London, passing ciphered letters between Argyll and the whig lords active in the Rye House plot. In June 1683 Holmes was arrested and committed to the Gatehouse, charged with treason. Argyll's encoded letters along with some of their keys were found in his possession. On 29 June Holmes confessed that the letters concerned negotiations between Argyll and the whig leaders, including Monmouth and Lord Russell, to raise an insurrection in Scotland. Holmes, whose wife was granted permission to visit him in gaol, was not brought to trial, nor is it clear whether he escaped his imprisonment or if he was released.<br>
<br>Holmes was in the Netherlands by 1684, however, consorting with the whigs and dissenters gathered around Monmouth and Argyll. He sailed to Lyme Regis with Monmouth in 1685 as lieutenant-colonel of the Green regiment. His son, Blake, who joined him from London, was made a captain. Both fought at Norton St Philip, where Abraham's arm was shattered and Blake was killed. On 6 July Holmes valiantly led the Green regiment into action at Sedgemoor. He was captured on the battlefield, stripped, and carried to the house of a JP. There he amputated his own mangled arm with a carving knife in the justice's kitchen. He was sent back to London and interrogated on 20 July, mentioning only Captain Foulkes and Major Thomas Venner. James II attended his interrogation and offered Holmes his life if he would promise to live in peace. Holmes reportedly replied, &#145;I am an aged man and what remains to me of life is not worth a falsehood or a baseness. I have always been a republican; and I am still&#146;  (Macaulay, 2.636).<br>
<br>Holmes was tried on a charge of high treason by Judge Jeffreys at Dorchester on 10 September 1685; he pleaded guilty and was hanged at Lyme Regis on 12 September. According to whig martyrologists, writing after the revolution, onlookers at his execution were amazed as the horses that were first to pull the sledge of prisoners refused to stir and their replacements broke it to pieces. Holmes and the others walked to the gallows. There Holmes sat at the foot of the ladder and addressed the spectators, asserting that he had joined Monmouth because he &#145;believed the Protestant religion was bleeding, and in a step towards extirpation&#146;. He continued that while God had not appointed them to be &#145;the instruments in so glorious a work; yet notwithstanding he &hellip; doubted not but that God would make use of others that should meet with better success&#146;  (J. Tutchin, <span class="italic">The Western Martyrology</span>, 1705, 170&#150;71).<br>
