<span class="headword">O'Donel,  James Louis</span>  (1737&#150;1811), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of Newfoundland</span>, was born at Knocklofty, co. Tipperary, the son of a local farmer, Michael O'Donel, and his wife, Ann Crosby. He and his older brother Michael began their schooling under a private tutor, followed by classical studies in Limerick. At the age of eighteen he entered the Franciscan order and left Ireland for theological studies in St Isidore's College, Rome, an institution run by the Franciscans of the Irish province. After ordination in Rome, he taught theology and philosophy in Prague at Immaculate Conception College, an Irish Franciscan seminary, for several years. He returned to Waterford in 1767 in order to take up duties as guardian of the Franciscan house there. In 1779 he was elected provincial of the order in Ireland, and remained in office until the end of his term in 1782.<br>
<br>In 1783 the governor of Newfoundland, John Campbell, permitted the construction of a Roman Catholic chapel in St John's, and a group of local Catholic merchants made application to Bishop William Egan of Waterford for O'Donel's services. Bishop Egan corresponded with Bishop James Talbot, the vicar apostolic of the London district and the official responsible for any Catholic mission work in Newfoundland. Bishop Talbot wrote to Rome, asking that O'Donel be made prefect apostolic of Newfoundland, which would place the territory directly under O'Donel's jurisdiction and make him answerable directly to the Holy See.<br>
<br>Shortly after O'Donel arrived in St John's on 4 July 1784, he received news that he had been made prefect apostolic. He was the first officially recognized Roman Catholic priest in the area. He subsequently encountered some difficulties in asserting his authority over two priests, first with Patrick Lonergan, a Dominican whose conduct created some tension with the civil authorities, and later with Patrick Power, a Franciscan who worked in Placentia without proper ecclesiastical permission and who attempted to discredit O'Donel. O'Donel excommunicated both Lonergan and Power, although it took some time and much correspondence between St John's, the Irish bishops, and the head of the Roman Congregatio de Propaganda Fide, before Power eventually departed the island.<br>
<br>O'Donel also faced opposition from the two governors who succeeded Campbell. One of Governor John Elliot's captains was Prince William Henry, later William IV (1830&#150;37), who arrived in Newfoundland in 1786. While stationed there the prince revoked some privileges granted Catholics in Placentia in the summer of 1786 and later publicly insulted O'Donel, throwing an iron file at the priest in a fit of rage. Two years later Captain Edward Pellew, surrogate for Placentia, passed on some defamatory information about O'Donel, given him by Power, to Governor Elliot, who considered restricting the presence of priests on the island. Elliot backed down only after hearing O'Donel out. Governor Mark Milbanke, Elliot's successor, accused O'Donel of encouraging fishermen to remain resident in Newfoundland over the winter, and refused permission to Thomas Anthony Ewer, one of O'Donel's assistants, to construct a chapel at Ferryland. After O'Donel made some protestations to Milbanke, the governor threatened further restrictions. The arrival in 1791 of Chief Justice John Reeves, who was more favourably disposed to a Catholic presence on the island, put an end to the proposed restrictions.<br>
<br>Despite these tensions and difficulties, O'Donel's mission prospered. On 5 January 1796, at the request of some prominent lay people, O'Donel was made vicar apostolic of Newfoundland, and on 21 September was consecrated at Quebec as titular bishop of Thyatira. In 1801 he published a body of diocesan statutes and divided the diocese into missions, he himself, owing to the shortage of clergy, being obliged to act as a mission priest. He used his influence to check disaffection to the government among the predominately Irish Roman Catholics, advocating obedience and co-operation with the civil authorities during a period shortly after the Irish rising and the French Revolution, when tensions between Irish and English residents on the island would have been high. O'Donel's constant discouragement of violence among the Catholics of the colony helped to prevent wide-scale popular involvement during the planned mutiny of some soldiers in the Royal Newfoundland fencible regiment in 1800. As a token of thanks for his service to the colony, a number of prominent members of the community and Governor Sir Erasmus Gower asked for and secured a British government pension of &pound;50 per annum for Bishop O'Donel.<br>
<br>O'Donel's missionary exertions wore out his health, and, having suffered a stroke, he wrote to the pope requesting a coadjutor bishop on 15 July 1804. His successor, Patrick Lambert, arrived in St John's in August 1806, and O'Donel resigned on 1 January 1807, remaining on the island until July of that year. He was f&ecirc;ted by the prominent members of the St John's community and given a silver urn in appreciation.<br>
<br>O'Donel spent his last years at Waterford, where he died on 1 April 1811, having suffered serious burns in a house fire a few days before. He was buried in St Mary's Church, Irishtown, Clonmel, in co. Tipperary.<br>
