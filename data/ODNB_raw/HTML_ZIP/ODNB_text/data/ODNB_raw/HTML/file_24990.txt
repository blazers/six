<span class="headword">Seton <span class="st"> [Seaton]</span>,  John Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1735, <em>d.</em> in or after 1806), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born in Scotland, the son of Christopher Seton (<i>d</i>. 1768), a gem engraver, who was a pupil of Charles Christian Reisen. Christopher Seton practised in London, became a director of the Society of Artists in 1765, and died on 6 October 1768. John Thomas Seton was a pupil of Francis Hayman and studied at the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96317', "St Martin's Lane Academy")</script> in London. He was in Rome in 1758&#150;9 and helped to buy pictures for Lord Bute's collection. In 1759 he is &#145;listed in the <i>Stato delle Anime</i> for the Parish of S. Lorenzo in Lucina as living in the Strada della Croce near the Piazza di Spagna (Archivio del Vicariato of the Vatican)&#146;  (Ford, 74 n. 12). On 3 March 1759 Richard Dalton wrote: &#145;Young Seaton and one Navy mind their studys much and hope will succeed in the portraits very well&#146;  (ibid., 68 n. 6).<br>
<br>Seton exhibited paintings at the Society of Artists in London between 1761 and 1772, and was elected a fellow of the society in 1769. His conversation pieces, painted about this time, are similar in style to Johan Zoffany's. His painting of the Chambers family (exh. Society of Artists, 1763) was sold at Sothebys on 13 March 1985 (lot 56). Walpole's description of it as &#145;A young lady sitting at a harpsichord, but talking, the mother sitting knotting, and a young lad standing at the other end of the harpsichord&#146;  (Graves, <span class="italic">Soc. Artists</span>, 229) leaves out the figure on the right, Sir Robert Chambers, chief justice of Bengal, and on the left, his brother Richard, mayor of Newcastle. Seton lived for some time in Bath, but was in Edinburgh between 1772 and 1774. In 1772 he painted an informal portrait of Elizabeth, countess of Leven, with her great-granddaughter Lady Anne Hope (priv. coll.). Another good example of his work is his portrait of John Carmichael, fourth earl of Hyndford (1773; priv. coll.). In 1774, when he exhibited three half-length portraits of ladies at the Royal Academy, his address was listed as St Andrew's Street, New Town, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1773 Seton painted William Fullerton of Carstairs, East India Company surgeon in Bengal, and Captain Ninian Lowis (NG Scot.) in a work that:<blockquote>is perhaps indicative of the robust but somewhat stolid and banal style with which he was later to render his sitters in Bengal. Characteristic are the diagonal shadows which slant down from the top left, a rectangular mass of darkness on the right hand side, strong highlights &hellip; careful skill in depicting features and a puritanical relish for sparse, unorganised settings. (Archer, 109)</blockquote>K. E. Maison noted that Seton's work &#145;shows a few invariable particularities: his sitter's eyes are always wide open and painted very minutely, but their gaze is nearly always oblique. Whenever possible, a dog &hellip; is introduced into the picture&#146;, and his figures &#145;are somewhat wooden and inactive&#146;  (Maison, 59).<br>
<br>In 1775 Seton applied to the East India Company and on 22 November was granted permission to go to Bengal to practise portrait painting. He arrived in Calcutta, probably on the <i>Lioness</i>, at the end of August 1776. He was in Bengal for nine years, and &#145;returned to England after an easy time &hellip; with twelve thousand pounds in his pocket&#146;  (Williamson, 142). In 1777 he exhibited a <span class="italic">Portrait of a Gentleman</span>, painted in Calcutta, at the Society of Artists. Seton bought a house in the avenue behind the residence of the governor-general of Bengal, Warren Hastings, for 33,000 rupees in October 1783  (Foster, 67). By that time his reputation was growing, and he was commissioned to paint the commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General Sir Eyre Coote (1783; BL OIOC), and the governor-general, Hastings (1784; Victoria Memorial Hall, Calcutta; replica the basis for the mezzotint engraving by John Jones, 1785).<br>
<br>Seton subsequently returned to Edinburgh, where he practised with repute as a portrait painter, and was living in 1806; it is presumed that he died there. Portraits by Seton are in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. A portrait of Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes (<i>c</i>.1766&#150;7), which was thought to be a companion piece to Seton's portrait of Dalrymple's second wife, Helen Fergusson (both Newhailes collection, National Trust for Scotland), has been reattributed to Allan Ramsay.<br>
