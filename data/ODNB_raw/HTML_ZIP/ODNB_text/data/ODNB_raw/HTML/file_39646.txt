<span class="headword">Watson,  John Boles</span>  (1748&#150;1813), <span class="occ">theatre manager</span>, was born on 9 November 1748 at Silver Fort, Cashel, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the second of the six children of Solomon Watson, possibly a farmer, and his wife, Susannah. The family belonged to the Society of Friends. After his twenty-first birthday Watson moved to England and became friendly with the actor John Philip Kemble. Forsaking earlier Quaker principles, he gained a footing in the company managed by Roger Kemble, John's father. Here he played under the assumed name of Carleton. However, ill health prevented him taking up the itinerant life of an actor; instead, in 1779 he opted for management, although he also appeared sporadically on the stage. At Roger Kemble's retirement Watson purchased a number of his theatres, while others were assigned to Henry Masterman.<br>
<br>Cheltenham became the headquarters of Watson's activities, and his performers were nominated the &#145;Cheltenham Company of Comedians&#146;. A converted malthouse off Pittville Street served as their theatre (the location is featured by Dinah Maria Muloch in chapter 6 of <span class="italic">John Halifax, Gentleman</span>, 1856). The second of Watson's Cheltenham theatres, opened in 1782, was situated in York Passage, near the High Street, a building visited by George III and the royal family when they took the waters in 1788. This was enough for Watson to dispense with the requirement of a patent in terming the playhouse the &#145;Theatre Royal&#146;. The minor remains of the building are now marked by a blue plaque. On the king's birthday, 4 June 1805, Watson's last Cheltenham theatre&#151;situated in Bath Street in the Cambray area of the town&#151;was opened.<br>
<br>Watson created a circuit of more than forty theatres: from Bristol in the south-west it reached northwards to Holywell in Flintshire, and from Leicester it stretched across the midlands and Wales to Carmarthen. In addition to Cheltenham, the principal locations of activity were Gloucester, Cirencester, Stroud, Hereford, Leominster, Monmouth, Swansea, Oswestry, Evesham, Stourbridge, Wolverhampton, Coventry, Birmingham, Daventry, Walsall, and Tamworth.<br>
<br>Allowing for the difficulties under which a Georgian manager worked, Watson's company was proficient rather than distinguished. William Field, a contemporary Warwick historian, judged it to be averagely provincial. Visiting performers from London could take a harsher line: Dorothy Jordan wrote that at Worcester the supporting performers put her in a foul temper with their &#145;ignorance and stupidity&#146;  (Aspinall, 187). Nevertheless, Watson possessed the foresight to choose a band of players who would acquit themselves creditably for much of the time: Mrs Carleton, later to manage a company in Wales, was a leading lady praised for her tragic portraits, and was ably supported by her husband, an upstanding uniformed figure; William Buckle combined the heavy roles of tragedy and sentiment with the additional work of prompter and stage manager; Chamberlain, the company treasurer, specialized in comedy; Richards, a dancer, singer, and comedian, also engaged in ageing tragic nobles; Field was suited by youth and temperament to light romantic roles; George Shuter, the son of Edward Shuter of the London patent theatres, was a favourite over many years; and Samuel Seward gained more than a local name as a harlequin and also opened in Cheltenham his own theatre, the Sadler's Wells or English Fantoccini. The scenic artists were Samuel (?) Whitmore, later at Covent Garden, and Seward.<br>
<br>Some members of Watson's family worked in the theatre, and it is convenient to consider them and the non-theatricals together. According to the <span class="italic">Thespian Dictionary</span> Watson's first marriage was to a Miss Wilkinson. After her early death he married his second wife, Henrietta Withington, a widow, at Cheltenham by special licence on 18 October 1785. The couple had two children, Louisa and John Boles Watson II. Louisa married in 1802 John Richer, the rope-walker of Sadler's Wells Theatre. Having abandoned the Wells, Richer played a lively part in Watson's company, taking on such roles as Don Juan in the play of that name and the dumb Francesco in <span class="italic">The Tale of Mystery</span> (1802) by Thomas Holcroft, as well as continuing with his acrobatic feats. Louisa died &#145;of a decline&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 696) in Cheltenham on 17 July 1804; she had played no part on the stage, possibly deterred by ill health. John Boles Watson II performed throughout his life on the stages of the Watson circuit. He eventually married Frances Margaret, but his children&#151;two sons and three daughters&#151;were the outcome of passing liaisons. In spite of an inability to cope with the finances, Watson II attempted to organize the circuit after his father's gradual relinquishing of responsibility around 1811. About 1826 the rapidly diminishing circuit passed to Watson II's eldest son, yet another actor, John Boles Watson III.<br>
<br>In addition to the regular company, visitors from the London and Bristol stages appeared for brief periods, and the calibre of the stars aids a just evaluation of the standard of the company. Sarah Siddons played at Cirencester and Cheltenham in the early days of Watson's management. Her brother John Philip Kemble played Hamlet at Cheltenham and Gloucester. Elizabeth Richards, a Gloucestershire woman who joined the prestigious Bath company, arrived both before and after her marriage to John Edwin, sometimes playing only for a night at proximate Cotswold theatres. William Henry West Betty, the &#145;Young Roscius&#146;, was a child actor whose appeal lasted longer in the provinces than on the London stage; he played on the circuit at the height of his popularity in 1804 and later in 1807. Alexander Pope, the Cork actor who progressed to the London patent houses, arrived with his powerful voice to assume the role of Macbeth in 1811. Thus, while Watson could afford to hire players of worth to act on the circuit for a few nights, these engagements were limited, and for the most part the locally known actors had to sustain the interest of the season's audiences.<br>
<br>On 19 September 1811 an ailing Watson made his will, bequeathing his circuit of theatres to his son, John Boles Watson II. During the former's working life elaborate mortgages, sharings, and leasings of the theatres make their value difficult to calculate. Watson died at his home in High Street, Cheltenham, &#145;affected with gout, which terminated his existence by an attack on the vitals&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gloucester Journal</span>, 22 March 1813), on 18 March 1813. He was buried in the graveyard of the parish church of St Mary, Cheltenham, on 22 March.<br>
