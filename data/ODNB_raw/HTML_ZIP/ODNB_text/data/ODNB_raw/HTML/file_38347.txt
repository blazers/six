<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Robert</span>  (1883&#150;1952), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 1 August 1883, at 23 West Street, Wigton, in Cumberland, the son of Robert Atkinson, a joiner and cabinet-maker, and his wife, Elizabeth Johnston. By 1896 his family had moved to Nottingham, and he trained as an architect there, at Nottingham School of Art and at University College, and was articled to the Nottingham architect James Harris before moving to London in 1905 and working in the office of John Belcher. He later became a draughtsman for C. E. Mallows, the country-house architect, and collaborated with R. Frank Atkinson (no relation) and the leading landscape architect T. H. Mawson. Much of his work for them was as a perspectivist, a skill then greatly revered, at which he excelled. In 1907 he set up in practice with George Nott, Charles Gascoyne, and Alick Horsnell. Three years later he was elected ARIBA and in 1912 entered partnership with George Alexander. The following year he was appointed head of the Architectural Association school, London, and in 1915 he was elected FRIBA.<br>
<br>In his buildings Atkinson showed himself a highly versatile eclectic, using in a distinctively personal manner almost every style at one time or another from American <i>Beaux-Arts</i> to oriental; he believed that by developing traditional styles a modern idiom, suitable for the times, would emerge. It was as a pioneer in cinema architecture that he made his name. His talents for colour, decoration, and interior design, developed in cinemas in Edinburgh, Liverpool, and numerous midland towns, culminated with the Regent Cinema, Brighton (1919&#150;21; 1923; dem. 1974), called by Howard Robertson &#145;his No. 1 Symphony&#146;. This, the first luxury cinema on the American model in Britain, was one of the most remarkable British buildings of the 1920s: it seated nearly 3000 people and boasted a restaurant, tea-room, roof-garden, promenade, and ballroom. Atkinson's flair for decoration reached its acme in the entrance hall of the Daily Express Building (1931&#150;2), probably the best surviving art deco interior in Britain.<br>
<br>But Atkinson also rose to the challenge of new building techniques and types: St Catherine's Church, Hammersmith (1922&#150;3; dest. 1940), was the first steel-framed church in England and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts at the University of Birmingham (1935&#150;9) was the first British purpose-built institution for the study of art history. The institute is undoubtedly Atkinson's finest surviving building. It contains an art gallery of international standing, a music auditorium, and the departments of history of art and music of the University of Birmingham. In design and style it triumphantly combines practicality with aesthetic merit, and the essential austerity of its brick and stone exterior is embellished with some excellent period detail. It was deemed by Sir John Summerson to represent &#145;better than almost any other building (except, perhaps the RIBA in Portland Place) the spirit of English architecture in the 1930s&#146;  (J. Chapel and C. Gere, eds., <span class="italic">The Fine and Decorative Art Collections of Britain and Ireland</span>, 1985, 18). Other inter-war works by Atkinson included: the Gresham Hotel, Dublin (1925&#150;7); the Dome Hall of Music and Corn Exchange, Brighton (1934&#150;5); Wallington Town Hall and Municipal Library (1933&#150;5); and Oslo Court, Regent's Park (1936&#150;7). After the war Atkinson worked on electric power stations at Croydon (1945&#150;51) and Wigan (1947&#150;51).<br>
<br>Atkinson was well travelled and greatly influenced by the leading Scandinavian and Dutch architects of his day, such as E. G. Asplund and W. M. Dudok. Yet he could accept neither the <i>tabula rasa</i> required by modernism, nor its utopianism, and held rather that the architect should remain an artist. However, in the post-war years, with economic stringency and the predominance of the modern movement, this position became increasingly untenable and he found himself obliged to produce less creative and convincing work, such as the ill-fated government offices, Marsham Street, Westminster (begun in 1949 but radically revised after his death), and the government rehousing scheme, Gibraltar (1946&#150;50). Even in the post-modern architectural climate of the late twentieth century his instinctive and undogmatic attitude to style was not fully appreciated and much of his work remains relatively unknown.<br>
<br>Atkinson was a distinguished teacher and theoretician. In 1919 he visited the United States to study architectural education and cinema design. Three years later his <span class="italic">Report on the Education of the Architect in the United States of America</span> was published by the RIBA. From 1920 to 1929 he was director of education at the Architectural Association and his academic and pedagogical achievements are best represented by the influential <span class="italic">Theory and Elements of Architecture</span>, published jointly with Hope Bagenal in 1926 (further volumes were intended but never materialized). An inspiring lecturer, he revolutionized the teaching at the Architectural Association, bringing out the best in his colleagues, so that the school began to take a leading place in British architectural education.<br>
<br>&#145;A reddish-haired, shrewd looking man with sharp features&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Dec 1952), Atkinson was forthright and often unconventional in manner. His directness is most memorably enshrined in the reception accorded to Frank Yerbury, secretary of the Architectural Association, who went formally to invite him to join the staff, dressed in a top hat, only to be greeted with the words, &#145;Why are you wearing that damned thing?&#146;  (Yerbury, 120). Yet Howard Robertson, Atkinson's successor as principal of the Architectural Association, recorded that &#145;when his wisdom hurt, his unfailing humour set all right again and especially when one could go to his room and pass from the subject of architecture to those of the books and antiques that he loved so well&#146;  (H. Robertson, <span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 21). A noted connoisseur of architectural books and a collector of furniture and pictures, Atkinson lent part of his collection of candlesticks to the Victoria and Albert Museum for many years.<br>
<br>In 1927 Atkinson was awarded an honorary MArch by the University of Liverpool, and the same year was appointed an assessor of the competition for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford upon Avon. In 1931 he became an assessor for the RIBA Building, Portland Place, London, and for the city hall, Norwich&#151;the latter perhaps the foremost public building of the inter-war years. In 1932 he was made a director of the Building Centre. Five years later he and his partner, Alexander Anderson, were awarded the RIBA London architecture bronze medal for Stockleigh Hall flats, Regent's Park, and in 1946 he gained the RIBA architecture bronze medal for the Barber Institute. In 1951 he was appointed OBE. His death occurred unexpectedly, after a short illness, on 26 December 1952 at Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, Marylebone, London. He left a son, John R. Atkinson, but no details are known of his wife.<br>
