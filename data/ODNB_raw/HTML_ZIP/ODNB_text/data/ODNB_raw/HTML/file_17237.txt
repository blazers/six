<span class="headword">Lyall,  William Rowe</span>  (1788&#150;1857), <span class="occ">dean of Canterbury</span>, born in London on 11 February 1788, was the second son and fourth child of John Lyall (1752&#150;1805) of Findon, Sussex, a Scottish merchant and shipowner in the city of London, and his wife, Jane Camming or Comyn (<i>d</i>. 1867). His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17235/', "George Lyall (1778/9&#150;1853)")</script>, was MP for the City of London and chairman of the East India Company. William Lyall was educated at Fulham Park School, and in 1805 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1810 and MA in 1816. In 1817 he married Catharine, youngest daughter of Joseph Brandreth, physician, of Hall Green, Liverpool. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Lyall was curate of Fawley, Hampshire, from 1812 to 1815, when he moved to London. He was appointed chaplain to St Thomas's Hospital in 1817, and soon afterwards assistant preacher at Lincoln's Inn. In 1822 he became examining chaplain to William Howley, bishop of London, his patron, by whom he was appointed rector of Weeley, Essex, in 1823 and archdeacon of Colchester in 1824. He was Warburtonian lecturer at Lincoln's Inn in 1826, when his subject was &#145;The prophetical evidences of Christianity&#146;. In 1827 he became rector of Fairsted, Essex, and in 1833 exchanged this living and that of Weeley for the cure of Hadleigh, Essex, where he carried out a notable revival of the parish. In June 1841 Howley, now archbishop of Canterbury, appointed him to the archdeaconry of Maidstone and to a prebendal stall at Canterbury, and the following year he became rector of Great Chart, near Ashford. In November 1845 he accepted Sir Robert Peel's offer of the deanery of Canterbury. Earlier he had been one of the founders of St Augustine's College, Canterbury, and as dean he did much for the restoration of the cathedral.<br>
<br>Lyall made his name as a young man with two articles in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> (6, 1811, 1&#150;37; 12, 1814, 281&#150;317) challenging the metaphysical system of Dugald Stewart and proving that an Anglican theologian could match the Scottish Enlightenment on its own ground. He was editor of the <span class="italic">British Critic</span> in 1816&#150;17, and in 1820 was entrusted by Archbishop Howley with reorganizing the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia metropolitana</span>, intended to act as a Christian counterweight to the secular <span class="italic">Britannica</span>. His contributors, enlisted from all tendencies, included the future adversaries R. D. Hampden and J. H. Newman. The latter wrote the articles on Cicero and Apollonius of Tyana&#151;his first published work. From 1832 to 1846 Lyall was co-editor with H. J. Rose of the <span class="italic">Theological Library</span>, which ran to fourteen volumes. The conference he and Rose organized at Rose's rectory at Hadleigh, Suffolk, in 1833 is generally regarded as marking the inauguration of the Oxford Movement, though Lyall himself stood aside from the movement. His increasing interest in biblical scholarship bore fruit in 1840 in his major work, <span class="italic">Propaedia prophetica: a View of the Use and Design of the Old Testament</span>, which made his reputation as an interpreter of Jewish religion and society. Though he appointed his brother, four nephews, and three nephews-in-law to livings at his disposal, he took pains to match the appointee with the appointment, and demanded high standards from his clergy. Cheerful and courteous in manner, he was eirenic in his churchmanship and inherited from his father a sound instinct for business which served him well as an organizer of church building in Essex and cathedral restoration in Canterbury.<br>
<br>Lyall suffered a stroke in 1852 from which he never recovered; he died at the deanery, Canterbury, on 17 February 1857, and was buried in Harbledown churchyard on 26 February.<br>
