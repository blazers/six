<span class="headword">Banks,  Isabella Varley</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Isabella Varley; <em>known as </em>Mrs G. Linnaeus Banks]</span>  (1821&#150;1897), <span class="occ">public lecturer and writer</span>, was born on 25 March 1821, at Oldham Street, Manchester, the daughter of James Varley, chemist (<i>d</i>. 1842), and his wife, Amelia Daniels. Her grandfather, James Varley the elder, of Bolton, discovered chloride of lime as a means of bleaching cotton. She was educated at Green Street School, Miss Hannah Spray's Ladies' day school, and the Revd John Weelden's academy. Her first literary effort, a poem entitled &#145;A Dying Girl to her Mother&#146;, was published in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 12 April 1837, when she was just sixteen. From 1838 to 1848 she kept a school at Cheetham, near Manchester, and in 1842 became a member of the ladies' committee of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>. The first of her three volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Ivy Leaves: a Collection of Poetry</span>, was published in 1844. She was also skilled in needlework and knitting and produced a fancy-work pattern each month for forty-five years from 1850 to 1895; these were published in little quarterly volumes. A deep interest in the tradition of British literature prompted her participation in the London Shakespeare tercentenary (23 April 1864), where she baptized a memorial oak, presented by Queen Victoria and planted by the actor Samuel Phelps, with water from the River Avon, and delivered an address.<br>
<br>On 27 December 1846, Isabella Varley married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1295/', "George Linnaeus Banks (1821&#150;1881)")</script>, a journalist and poet from Birmingham, and later assisted him in his work by contributing to the journals he edited. These included: the <span class="italic">Harrowgate Advertiser</span>, the <span class="italic">Birmingham Mercury</span>, the <span class="italic">Dublin Daily Express</span>, the <span class="italic">Durham Chronicle</span>, the <span class="italic">Sussex Mercury</span>, and the <span class="italic">Windsor Royal Standard</span>. As she accompanied him about the country to these various posts, she acquired the historical and dialectal background which she would later use in her novels. In 1865 she and her husband co-authored a collection of songs and poetry, <span class="italic">Daisies in the Grass</span>.<br>
<br>Mrs Banks's domestic life was difficult: she gave birth to eight children, five of whom predeceased her; she suffered more or less constantly from ill health; and her husband had a progressive drinking problem which eventually caused him several times to sell their household furniture to raise money for alcohol, and resulted in his near-suicidal depression in later life. When she was forty-three she turned to novel writing to support her family. Her first novel, <span class="italic">God's Providence House</span> (1865), was set in Chester and was well received by critics. Between 1865 and 1894 she published twelve novels, three volumes of poetry, and three volumes of stories, many of the titles running to multiple editions, which kept her name before the public almost continually during those years. She became known as the Lancaster Novelist because of the setting of her novels in such places as Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Durham, Birmingham, Chester, and Manchester. &#145;In every case the dialect is as carefully done as the rest of the details, the author having a special gift for reproducing in type the peculiarities of local pronunciation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span>, 22 Oct 1896).<br>
<br>Mrs Banks's most famous and enduring novel was <span class="italic">The Manchester Man</span> (1870) which went through eleven editions, five during her lifetime and six posthumously, the latest being 1991. It is set in Manchester at the beginning of the nineteenth century and gave the best available picture of the &#145;buildings, institutions, and personalities in the days of &#147;Peterloo&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span>, 13 May 1897). Another of her books, <span class="italic">More than Coronets</span> (1881), which first appeared as a serial in the <span class="italic">Girl's Own Paper</span>, is of interest because one of the main characters, Hesba Stapleton, a physician, is based on her friend the noted journalist and feminist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37764/', "Florence Fenwick Miller")</script>, who practised medicine briefly in the 1870s  (<span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span>, 13 May 1897).<br>
<br>Mrs Banks was a firm supporter of women's rights and women's suffrage, saying that as long as &#145;women have to pay for the maintenance of governments, local and national, I consider that they have as clear a right to vote for proper representation as have their masculine relations&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman's Signal</span>, 13 May 1897).<br>
<br>Despite the popularity of Mrs Banks's writing, finances were a continual problem for her. She received numerous grants from the Royal Literary Fund, and attracted the special attention of fellow novelist Anthony Trollope, who suggested that her &#145;reward in literary life had fallen short of [her] deserts&#146;  (&#145;Anthony Trollope at the Royal Literary Fund&#146;, <span class="italic">Nineteenth-Century Fiction</span>, December 1982, 322). She also received a pension from the civil list in 1895. Among her contemporary literary friends were Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, Mary Howitt, Elizabeth Gaskell, Mrs Henry Wood, Eliza Cook, and John Strange Winter (Henrietta Stannard).<br>
<br>Mrs G. Linnaeus Banks died on 4 May 1897 of heart failure, following influenza and bronchitis, at her home, 34 Fassett Square, Dalston, London.<br>
