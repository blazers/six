<span class="headword">Robertson,  Alexander</span>  (1896&#150;1970), <span class="occ">organic chemist and farmer</span>, was born on 12 February 1896 on a farm at Charlesfield, Auchterless (on the Hatton estate), Aberdeenshire, the son of Andrew Robertson, farmer, and his wife, Jane Cantlay. Robertson was the eldest of three children; his twin sisters predeceased him. He was educated at the Auchterless School and Turriff higher grade school, leaving both as dux. He entered the University of Aberdeen in 1914 and, like most Scottish students of that time, took the MA course. He presented botany, chemistry, geology, Latin, mathematics, physics, political economy, and zoology at the preliminary level, and in 1915&#150;16 was placed first in chemistry. He enlisted in the special brigade, Royal Engineers, in March 1916, and in March 1917 was commissioned in the 2nd Seaforth Highlanders. He was discharged from the service in 1918 with the rank of lieutenant after being badly gassed in France.<br>
<br>After resumption of his studies at Aberdeen Robertson obtained his MA in 1919 and went on with a scholarship to study for a degree in science at the University of Glasgow. In the final examination (BSc, 1922) he received special distinction in advanced inorganic, physical, organic, and general technical chemistry. Robertson then obtained a Carnegie research fellowship for two years for research at Glasgow, under Professor G. G. Henderson's supervision, and gained his PhD in 1924. In the same year Robertson was also awarded a Ramsay memorial fellowship, but he resigned this almost immediately in order to accept a Rockefeller international science fellowship to work for two years with Professor Robert Robinson at the University of Manchester. Robertson spent six months of this fellowship at the University of Graz, Austria, studying the new and revolutionary technique of microanalysis with Professor Fritz Pregl.<br>
<br>In 1926, Robertson was appointed assistant lecturer in chemistry at the University of Manchester, and continued his work with Robinson during a period when organic chemistry at Manchester was blossoming. Under Robinson and Arthur Lapworth staff conducted research into the chemistry of the anthocyanins, the alkaloids of the morphine and strychnine groups, and the development of the electronic theory of organic reaction mechanisms. On 9 September 1925, Robertson married Margaret Mitchell (<i>d</i>. 1960), daughter of Alexander Chapman, a farmer and wood merchant of Forglen, Banffshire. She had graduated in medicine from Aberdeen in 1919. It was said to be a happy marriage.<br>
<br>In 1928 Robertson became reader in chemistry at the East London (later Queen Mary) College in the University of London, moving in 1930 to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine where he was appointed reader in biochemistry. The influence of Harold Raistrick, who was the head of the department, undoubtedly stimulated Robertson's own later researches on fungal metabolites. From London, Robertson moved to Liverpool in 1933, to succeed Ian M. Heilbron as holder of the Heath Harrison chair of organic chemistry. He occupied this chair with outstanding distinction until he retired in 1957 to devote himself to his second profession&#151;farming. In Liverpool Robertson designed a new building for organic chemistry, which was completed in 1939. In addition to being head of a large and flourishing department, he was pro-vice-chancellor in 1949&#150;54. He also served, for varying periods, as chairman of the departmental grants committee and of the ICI fellowships committee, and was president of the University Club (1951&#150;4). He was elected to fellowship of the Royal Society in 1941, and was awarded the society's Davy medal in 1952. He received an honorary LLD of the University of Aberdeen in 1958, was for a time a member of the advisory council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and of the University Grants Committee (1955&#150;9). After his retirement, Robertson acted as adviser in chemistry to the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland (1960&#150;69), and was in great demand as a consultant to various agricultural research institutes and organizations. He was a member of the Agricultural Research Council from 1960 to 1965.<br>
<br>Robertson made significant contributions to the chemistry of natural oxygen heterocycles such as anthocyanins (with Robinson), to the rotenoids, and to the lichen substances&#151;especially usnic acid&#151;to fungal metabolites such as citrinin, citromycetin, and the sclerotiorin pigments, and to natural pigments such as dracorubin and rottlerin. He also made major contributions to the chemistry of naturally occurring bitter principles, and to nitrogen heterocycles, especially the bacterial metabolite, violascein, and, with H. G. Khorana (later a Nobel prize winner), to indoles and their hydroperoxides.<br>
<br>During his academic life Robertson always maintained close links with active farming, disappearing from Liverpool each summer to supervise the harvest on the farm in Aberdeenshire which he rented from 1939. On his retirement he commenced full-time farming, first in Aberdeenshire and later on a 2000 acre estate at Roxholm Grange, Sleaford, Lincolnshire, in partnership with his only child, Euan. Shortly after the move to Roxholm his wife died; Robertson never really recovered from the loss.<br>
<br>Robertson was a man of imposing stature, possessed of a natural shyness and dislike for publicity which caused him to refuse many social engagements. This shyness was disguised by a brusque exterior which was frequently misunderstood by contemporaries, but to those who knew him sufficiently well he was a different person. It was typical of his character not to leave a record or a photograph with the Royal Society, and to refuse all invitations to sit for a portrait. Robertson died in Grantham Hospital on 9 February 1970.<br>
