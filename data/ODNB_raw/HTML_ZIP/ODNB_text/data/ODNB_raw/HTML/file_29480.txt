<span class="headword">Forz <span class="st"> [Fortibus]</span>,  William  de</span>, count of Aumale  (<em>b. </em>before 1216, <em>d.</em> 1260), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29476/', "William de Forz, count of Aumale (d. 1241)")</script>, and his wife, Aveline, daughter of Richard de Montfichet of Stansted, Essex. His title of count of Aumale was derived from the <i>comt&eacute;</i> of Aumale in Normandy; the family name evolved from Forz to Fortibus, but both forms are found. He was born before 17 December 1216, when his father gave the king his eldest son, William, as a hostage; he was probably one of the little boys who had been sent with their mother to Devizes Castle some months earlier. Nothing is known of his early life until his marriage, before 1234, to Christiana, one of the daughters of Alan of Galloway and his wife Margaret, the eldest sister of John the Scot, later earl of Chester. Christiana de Forz became in 1235 coheir of her father's lands in Galloway, and in 1237 coheir to her mother's interest in the earldom of Chester.<br>
<br>Neither the Galloway lands nor the Chester inheritance, however, were to be retained by the Forz family. When Christiana died in 1246 without surviving children, her Galloway lands returned to her surviving sister, Dervorguilla, wife of John de Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1269). On the death of the earl of Chester without male heirs in 1237, William de Forz claimed that Chester was, as a palatinate, impartible, and that he should by right of his wife, the senior coheir, be both earl of Chester and the holder of all the lands of the earldom. The court allowed Forz the title, but decided that the lands of the honour should be divided. The king, however, persuaded the coheirs and their husbands to give up their claims, in exchange for lands elsewhere. William and Christiana de Forz finally quitclaimed their rights to the earldom in October 1241, in return for an insignificant amount of property elsewhere. William de Forz's father died in March 1241 and the king had taken the son's homage by 18 September 1241, when the escheator was ordered to give William de Forz, son of William de Forz, all lands, tenements, and castles that he held in chief, that is, honours based on the castles of Cockermouth, Cumberland, Skipton in Craven, and Skipsea in Holderness, both in Yorkshire. In 1242 and 1245 William de Forz, count of Aumale, accompanied Henry III on his campaigns in Poitou and Wales. After Christiana's death in 1246, in 1248 or 1249 the count married again. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47209/', "Isabella de Forz (1237&#150;1293)")</script>, his second wife, was another great heiress, born Isabella de Revi&egrave;res, the daughter of the earl of Devon.<br>
<br>His northern property and his Scottish connections through his first wife made William de Forz a useful mediator with the Scots, and in 1231 when the king of England and the king of Scots made a treaty at York, he was one of the pledges for the Scottish king. He was appointed justice of the forest for Cumberland in 1251, and was sent on an embassy to Scotland in 1255; in the same year he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland and keeper of Carlisle Castle, offices he held until his death. In 1257 he was called to the army of Wales but paid scutage instead, because he was ill. The count of Aumale took a prominent part in the events of 1258, being appointed one of the king's counsellors under the provisions of Oxford. He was one of the escorts chosen to ensure that the Lusignan brothers left England safely. In March 1259 he was a member of Gloucester's reactionary party, and was one of those who made a pact with the Lord Edward. He went to France with the king in the autumn, was at Paris from December 1259 to January 1260, and at St Omer with the king in February. Later in the year he was again in France, on legal business, and died there on 23 May 1260, at Amiens. His body was buried in Thornton Abbey, Lincolnshire, at the feet of his mother, and his heart was buried at Meaux Abbey, Yorkshire, in the presbytery next to his daughter. With his second wife William de Forz had numerous children, but only one, Aveline, lived into adult life, to marry Henry III's younger son Edmund, earl of Lancaster; she died without any children in 1274.<br>
<br>As a great landowner William de Forz, the last count of Aumale, was inevitably involved in government and diplomacy, yet his personality is shadowy and as an individual he remains the least interesting of his line.<br>
