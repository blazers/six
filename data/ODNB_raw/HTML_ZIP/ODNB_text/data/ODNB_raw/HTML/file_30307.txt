<span class="headword">Zucchi,  Antonio Pietro Francesco</span>  (1726&#150;1795), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Venice on 1 May 1726, the son of Francesco Zucchi (1692&#150;1764), an engraver. He was a member of a large family of artists, and studied with his father, his uncle Carlo Zucchi, a master of perspective and teacher of Piranesi, Francesco Fontebasso, and Jacopo Amigoni. His extant works in Venice include the <span class="italic">Via crucis</span> (<i>c</i>.1750; San Giobbe) and <span class="italic">The Incredulity of St Thomas</span> (<i>c</i>.1766; San Toma). His style developed from Venetian rococo to neo-classical. He was elected a member of the Accademia di Pittore e Scultore, Venice (1759). Conceivably the architect Robert Adam engaged Zucchi to make drawings from the Spalatro sketches for plates in <span class="italic">The Ruins of the Palace of Diocletian at Spalatro</span> (1764), to which Zucchi subscribed, but Zucchi did not accompany Adam and C.-L. Cl&eacute;risseau to Dalmatia in 1757, as stated by Goethe and in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Zucchi visited Pola, Istria, with James Adam and Cl&eacute;risseau in 1760 and in 1761 went to live with them in Rome. They sketched in the city and the surrounding countryside and visited Naples. Goethe stated that &#145;he [Zucchi] drew figures for buildings and ruins which Cl&eacute;risseau later published&#146;  (Goethe, 169). In 1763 James Adam noted that &#145;Zucchi [was] a worthy honest lad, a most singular character&#146;  (Clerk MSS, GD 18/4955).<br>
<br>In 1766 Zucchi and his brother <a href="#cosubject_30307">Giuseppe [<i>see below</i>]</a> arrived in London to work for Robert Adam. Zucchi became his chief decorative painter, especially known for his large capriccios (for example, those at Harewood House, Yorkshire), illustrations from Homer and Virgil (examples at Home House, London), and arabesque work (as in the Lansdowne House drawing-room, now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art); he also made a drawing for a carpet at 20 St James's Square, London. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1770. He designed the frontispiece for <span class="italic">The Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam</span> (1773).<br>
<br>The diarist Joseph Farington noted that &#145;Zucchi &hellip; courted Angelica Kauffman, the Artist&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.74). Fifteen years her senior, he married her [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15188/', "Kauffman, (Anna Maria) Angelica Catharina (1741&#150;1807)")</script>] on 14 July 1781 and shortly afterwards they returned to Italy. He took charge of their household in Rome and showed great concern for her welfare. He recorded her work in his &#145;Memorandum of paintings of Maria Angelica Kauffmann&#146;. A stroke and ill health led to his death on 26 December 1795 at his home, via Sistina 72, Rome, and he was buried in S. Andrea delle Frate, Rome, where his wife was later to be interred beside him. A tablet bears witness to their mutual devotion. His will nominated the major part of his fortune to his own family. Alessandro Longhi drew and engraved Zucchi's portrait for his <span class="italic">Compendio delle vite de' pittori Veneziani istorici</span> (1762).<br>
<br>Antonio Zucchi's brother, <a name="cosubject_30307"></a><span class="headword">Giuseppe Carlo Zucchi</span>  (1721&#150;1805), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born in Venice and studied there with Francesco Zugno. He assisted his father, but, according to G. A. Moschini, appears never to have signed works until his father died in 1764, hence the difficulty in identifying which Zucchi engraved plates in Robert Adam's <span class="italic">Spalatro</span>. He went with his brother to London in 1766 and engraved four plates signed J. Zucchi for Robert and James Adam's <span class="italic">Works in Architecture</span> volumes 2 and 3 (1774&#150;5). He was included in the circle of friends of Angelica Kauffmann, many of whose etchings he strengthened with a burin. He returned to Italy (1779) and became a professor at the Accademia di Roma. In 1786 Giuseppe Carlo Zucchi wrote &#145;Memorie cronologiche della famiglia&#146; (MS, untraced) and in 1788 &#145;Memorie istoriche di Maria Angelica Kauffmann Zucchi&#146; (Vorarlberger Landesmuseum, Bregenz). Both works were consulted by G. G. de Rossi for his <span class="italic">Vita di Angelica Kauffmann, pittrice</span> (1810). Giuseppe Carlo Zucchi died in Venice in 1805.<br>
