<span class="headword">Ragg,  Thomas</span>  (1808&#150;1881), <span class="occ">preacher and writer</span>, was born at Nottingham on 11 January 1808, the son of George Ragg (1782&#150;1836) and Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morrison (<i>d</i>. 1822), whose grandfather was a Jacobite. Ragg's father, also born at Nottingham, was great-grandson of Benjamin Ragg, brother-in-law and coadjutor of Richard Newsham, the inventor. He moved to Birmingham the year after his son's birth, and set up a bookshop in Bull Street selling radical political publications. He also continued his large lace and hosiery business for several years, but his political activities consumed so much time that this business ended in bankruptcy. George Ragg was one of the conveners of the meeting held at New Hall Hill on 22 January 1817 to petition for parliamentary reform. In 1818 he founded the <span class="italic">Birmingham Argus</span>, a reform newspaper. The following year he was prosecuted for selling Carlile's <span class="italic">Republican</span>, and was imprisoned in 1820 and again in 1821. After his release he was present at the dinner given to Henry Hunt on 14 July 1823 by the Birmingham Union Society of Radical Reformers.<br>
<br>Thomas Ragg attended various dame-schools and then the academy of the prominent radical George Edmonds, an associate of his father, who later served as town clerk. He left school at the age of eleven and went to work for his father at <span class="italic">The Argus</span>. During his father's imprisonments he helped to support the family. In 1822, after the death of his mother, he was apprenticed at Leicester to his uncle, a hosier. The uncle soon moved to the neighbourhood of Nottingham and set up a lace manufactory. Ragg, originally an infidel like his father, soon converted to Christianity, married Mary Ann Clark in 1832, and became an itinerant dissenting preacher in the Nottingham area. He also published three volumes of poetry and contributed verses to the <span class="italic">Nottingham Review</span>. His uncle strongly disapproved of Ragg's literary interests, and the birth of a son and heir late in his life further damaged his relations with his nephew. In 1834 Ragg published <span class="italic">The Deity</span>, a work of blank verse in twelve volumes that detailed his conversion from infidelity to Christianity. Ragg dedicated the work to the poet James Montgomery, who helped arrange its publication. The work received favourable reviews from the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and other publications, but Ragg's uncle reacted with increased hostility, prompting Ragg to leave the business in 1834. He became an assistant to a bookseller named Dearden, in Nottingham, where he published other volumes of verse, wrote for local journals, and contributed an appeal on behalf of the weaver&#150;poet Robert Millhouse to <span class="italic">Dearden's Miscellany</span>.<br>
<br>Ragg's religious poetry attracted notice from Anglicans and dissenters alike. He received an offer of a university education on condition that he take holy orders but he declined. He also refused the pulpits of three nonconformist congregations. Instead, in 1839 he accepted the editorship of the Conservative <span class="italic">Birmingham Advertiser</span>, &#145;to bring about something like union and cordiality of feeling between Churchmen and Evangelical Dissenters&#146;  (Ragg, <span class="italic">God's Dealings</span>, xviii). For a short time he attended both an Anglican church and the prominent Carr's Lane Congregationalist Chapel, but left the latter after several chapel-goers accused him of hypocrisy in attending a dissenting chapel while editing a church publication. He was briefly a proprietor of <span class="italic">The Advertiser</span> and he also managed the <span class="italic">Midland Monitor</span> in 1841&#150;2. He continued to write verse, publishing seven volumes by 1843, and his poetry attracted the notice and friendship of Robert Southey. When <span class="italic">The Advertiser</span> failed in 1845, Ragg set up as a stationer and printer in Birmingham.<br>
<br>Frustrated by what he perceived as Birmingham's animosity toward intellectual culture, in 1844 Ragg became a member of the Birmingham Polytechnic Institution (successor to the Birmingham Mechanics' Institution), taking part in meetings and debates. He also served as the institution's official printer after 1845. In 1847 he founded the Birmingham branch of the Protestant Association of the Anglican church, and in 1849 founded its official organ, the <span class="italic">Protestant Watchman of the Midland District</span>, of which he was editor. The Protestant Association's pronounced anti-Catholicism was especially prominent in the &#145;papal aggression&#146; agitation of 1850&#150;51, and formed a counterpoint to the local rise of Tractarianism. Ragg also used the pages of the <span class="italic">Watchman</span> to protest against what he felt were the dangerously humanistic tendencies of George Dawson, an extremely popular local minister at the non-sectarian church of the Saviour. Later, in 1861, he debated with secularist George Jacob Holyoake in Birmingham's Temperance Hall.<br>
<br>In 1855 Ragg published <span class="italic">Creation's Testimony to its God, or the Accordance of Science, Philosophy, and Revelation</span>, an evidential treatise dedicated to the Revd J. B. Owen. This work obtained wide popularity, reaching a thirteenth edition in 1877. Ragg updated each reissue, in order to keep it abreast of modern scientific progress. The 1858 &#145;Teacher's Edition&#146; of this work was prefaced by an autobiography entitled <span class="italic">God's Dealings with an Infidel, or, Grace Triumphant</span>. Ragg also published two additional works on the reconciliation of science and Christianity in 1857 and 1858. <span class="italic">Creation's Testimony</span> brought Ragg to the attention of Dr George Murray, bishop of Rochester, who induced him to accept ordination in 1858. He was appointed by the bishop to a curacy, the salary of which the bishop paid himself, at Southfleet in Kent. On the bishop's death he became curate of Malin's Lee in Shropshire, and in 1865 was appointed perpetual curate of the newly formed parish of Lawley in Shropshire, where he remained until his death there on 3 December 1881. He was buried in Lawley churchyard. He was survived by two sons of his first marriage, and two daughters and six sons of his second marriage, to Jane Sarah Barker.<br>
