<span class="headword">Knolles,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1435), <span class="occ">merchant and mayor of London</span>, enjoyed an extraordinarily long career and was one of the few Londoners to serve twice as mayor. It has been said that he was an immigrant from Cheshire, but his father could have been the Richard Knolles who left property in Cheapside, while the Alison Knolles who was one of the few women to be a member of the Grocers' Company, and who appears in its list in 1383, could have been either his mother or a kinswoman. However, Thomas's election as warden of the company in 1387, without any previous mention in the city's records, raises the possibility that he purchased citizenship, aided by his connection with Sir Robert Knolles (<i>d</i>. 1407), whose executor and likely kinsman he was. In 1393 he was elected alderman for Dowgate, and the following year he served as sheriff. He transferred in 1397 to Cordwainer ward, where his house was in Watling Street, which was part of the grocers' trading quarter in St Antonin's parish. He was one of the leading parishioners who nominated chaplains to one of its chantries.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Knolles made his fortune, as the richest grocers normally did, by exporting wool or cloth; rather it would appear from two large debts owed to him by a provincial mercer and dyer that he principally distributed raw materials for the cloth trade. In the commercial depression of the early fifteenth century he ventured into tin, and was the partner of a prominent Cornish tin merchant, John Megre, who started manufacturing pewter in London in 1397. Knolles also invested in property in London and, moreover, had an estate at North Mimms in Hertfordshire. By 1412 his rents amounted to &pound;38, making him one of the richest owners of property in the city, but this income was modest compared with the capital he amassed.<br>
<br>Some of his property in Sopers Lane came to him as a reward for his services to the new Lancastrian dynasty. He may well have advanced in the grocers' ranks because his views coincided with those of the Chichele brothers who were committed Lancastrians. A lack of coin and a contraction of trade turned many Londoners against the government of Richard II, and it seems likely that Knolles was chosen as mayor in 1399 because he had been a leading supporter of the Lancastrian usurpation. At Christmas 1399 he rode out to Windsor to warn Henry IV of a plot by dissentient earls to restore Richard II, and afterwards he supported the new king with loans which helped to obtain the commercial policies Londoners wanted. Knolles's choice as one of the four treasurers appointed by parliament in 1404 to supervise expenditure on war demonstrates the public confidence he enjoyed, as indeed does his re-election as mayor in 1410. But by then the commercial recession was making men unwilling to accept public office, and Knolles's wealth was sorely needed by the city. He was the highest contributor to the city's loan for Henry V's campaign of 1417, lending &pound;200; and he had represented London in parliament the previous year.<br>
<br>Knolles was also a generous benefactor to the city, taking an active part in the rebuilding of the Guildhall in his second mayoralty. His religious orthodoxy is implied by his obtaining a papal indult to use a portable altar, by his appointment in January 1414 as one of the commissioners investigating Lollardy after Oldcastle's rebellion, and by his rebuilding of St Antonin's Church. He also acquired the advowson of the church of All Hallows, Honey Lane. His wealth funded many charitable works. With his son he provided fresh piped water for the prisoners of Newgate and Ludgate, and his wills show a concern for the poor of his mistery and for his estate at North Mimms. He was also a benefactor of the Grocers' Company, and with Robert Chichele he promoted the acquisition of its hall. They were two of the trustees who acquired its site in 1425, and Knolles contributed &pound;62 5<i>s</i>. in 1427 towards the building, while with his son Thomas he secured the company's incorporation in 1428. Among other gifts he paid for its almshouses in 1431.<br>
<br>Knolles's family life and friendships seem to have reflected his generosity of spirit. According to the inscription his son had carved on his memorial in St Antonin's Church, he and his wife, Joan, were married for sixty years and had nineteen children, of whom four sons and three daughters survived their father's death at Watling Street between 29 June and 11 July 1435. His eldest son, Thomas, followed his father in the Grocers' Company, while William became a grocer in Bristol. Knolles's daughter Marjorie married the grocer John Chichele, whom he assisted in repaying a large debt. The quality of Knolles's friendship appears from his joint offer with Robert Chichele in 1413 of 10,000 marks as security for Henry Somer (<i>d</i>. 1450), the chancellor of the exchequer, when he was impeached in parliament. He also brought up in his household, and was the guardian of, the son of a deceased fellow parishioner and grocer, John Oxney, whose widow he remembered in his will. A chantry was established for Knolles and his family in St Antonin's Church, in support of which Alderman William Gregory, a skinner, bequeathed an annual rent in 1461. Knolles clearly inspired a long-lasting affection.<br>
