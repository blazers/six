<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ashton,  Winifred</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Clemence Dane]</span>  (1888&#150;1965), <span class="occ">playwright and novelist</span>, was born on 21 February 1888 at Westcombe, Westcombe Park Road, Greenwich, London, the daughter of Arthur Charles Ashton, commission agent, and his wife, Florence Bentley, who provided a home of late Victorian respectability against which Winifred soon strongly reacted. Educated in England, Germany, and Switzerland, she rebelled and, intending to be a painter, became an art student (at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, 1904&#150;6, and in Germany at Dresden, 1906&#150;7), a teacher far from home (in Geneva in 1903, in Ireland 1907&#150;13), then an actress on the London stage (as Diana Portis, 1913&#150;15). Her d&eacute;but was in H. V. Esmond's <span class="italic">Eliza Comes to Stay</span>. Her experience was reflected in her very first novel, <span class="italic">Regiment of Women</span> (1917), a caustic look at a girls' school and lesbianism in that hothouse atmosphere. It was dedicated to a female companion, E. A. Its leading character is even less sympathetic than Muriel Spark's Miss Jean Brodie. Her second novel, <span class="italic">First the Blade</span> (1918), was a comedy, but then came a sort of expos&eacute; of the backbiting of bohemian writers she knew personally: in <span class="italic">Legend</span> (1919) a group of supposed mourners cattily dissect a literary &#145;legend&#146; who has just died. <span class="italic">The Way Things Happen</span> was the stage adaptation (produced 1923, published 1924).<br>
<br>Clemence Dane's stage work began with <span class="italic">A Bill of Divorcement</span> (starring Katherine Cornell, 1921); it asks whether a marriage should be annulled on grounds of insanity. In 1921 she also contributed <span class="italic">The Terror</span>, a minor pot-boiler, and the well-received verse play <span class="italic">Will Shakespeare</span> (the <span class="italic">Shakespeare in Love</span> of its day). Then the London theatre was auntie's way of capping a day of shopping in London, theatres and productions were plentiful and inexpensive, and tea was served at the interval.<br>
<br>To the commercial stage Clemence Dane brought &#145;plays for boys&#146; (<span class="italic">Shivering Shocks</span>, 1923; <span class="italic">Mr Fox</span>, 1927), bankable West End dramas (<span class="italic">Naboth's Vineyard</span>, 1925; <span class="italic">Granite</span>, 1926; <span class="italic">Mariners</span>, 1927; <span class="italic">A Traveller Returns</span>, 1928, and so on), musicals with Richard Addinsell (<span class="italic">Adam's Opera</span>, 1928; <span class="italic">Come of Age</span>, 1934; <span class="italic">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</span> and <span class="italic">Through the Looking-Glass</span> from Lewis Carroll, 1943 and 1948), adaptations (<span class="italic">L'aiglon</span> from Rostand, 1934; <span class="italic">The Happy Hypocrite</span> from Sir Max Beerbohm, 1936; <span class="italic">Herod and Mariamne</span> from Hebbel, 1936), and a string of middle-class matin&eacute;e plays (<span class="italic">Gooseberry Fool</span>, 1929; <span class="italic">Wild Decembers</span>, 1933; <span class="italic">Moonlight is Silver</span>, 1934; <span class="italic">England's Darling</span>, 1940; <span class="italic">Cousin Muriel</span>, 1940; <span class="italic">The Golden Reign of Queen Elizabeth</span>, 1941; <span class="italic">The Lion and the Unicorn</span>, 1943; <span class="italic">Call Home the Heart</span>, 1947). She became a fixture, whether with costume drama or contemporary drama. After a hiatus she returned with <span class="italic">Eighty in the Shade</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">The Godson</span> (1964), proving that changing tides of taste had still not done away with the old-fashioned well-constructed dramatic entertainment for the middle class. She had given them King Arthur and the Virgin Queen, Thomas Chatterton and the Bront&euml;s (played by Diana Wynyard, Beatrix Lehmann, and Emlyn Williams), the Bard in pursuit of Anne Hathaway, the young son of Napoleon, and titillating modern problems. The original stars of <span class="italic">Granite</span> (long considered her most serious play, the darling of amateur theatre groups in its day), Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson, returned thirty-two years later to star in <span class="italic">Eighty in the Shade</span>. David Storey's <span class="italic">Home</span> used the same sort of setting for a much more powerful play. However, these favourite stars and Clemence Dane's firm grasp of theatrical tricks impressed a loyal public.<br>
<br>Clemence Dane made less of a name (but more money) writing screenplays, beginning with <span class="italic">The Tunnel</span> (or <span class="italic">Transatlantic Tunnel</span>, 1935, with additional dialogue by Kurt Siodmak and L. D. Peach). That same year she adapted Tolstoy's <span class="italic">Anna Karenina</span> (also released as <span class="italic">Love</span>) for Greta Garbo. With Edward Knoblock she wrote <span class="italic">The Amateur Gentleman</span> (based on Jeffrey Farnol's Regency farrago, 1936), with Patrick Kirwin <span class="italic">Farewell Again</span> (or <span class="italic">Troopship</span>, 1937), with Sergei Nolbandov a classic star vehicle, <span class="italic">Fire over England</span> (for Flora Robson, 1937), on her own <span class="italic">St Martin's Lane</span> (or <span class="italic">Sidewalks of London</span>, 1938), with Elizabeth Baron <span class="italic">Salute John Citizen</span> (1942), with Anthony Pelissier <span class="italic">Perfect Strangers</span> (or <span class="italic">Vacation from Marriage</span>, 1945), with Cyril Hume and Michael Hogan <span class="italic">Bride of Vengeance</span> (1949), and with Karl Hartl and Franz Tassie <span class="italic">Angel with a Trumpet</span> (1950). She also wrote <span class="italic">Bonnie Prince Charlie</span> (1948). Clemence Dane competently collaborated in the film mills. The alternative titles above prove her work entertained both British and American filmgoers.<br>
<br>For radio Clemence Dane wrote <span class="italic">The Saviours: Seven Plays on one Theme</span> (1940&#150;41), <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> (adapted from Shakespeare, 1954), <span class="italic">Don Carlos</span> (adapted from Schiller, 1955), and <span class="italic">Scandal at Coventry</span>, her last radio drama, the story of Lady Godiva (1958). In that same year of 1958 her script for <span class="italic">Till Time Shall End</span> was broadcast on BBC television. In a golden age of BBC radio drama she could not equal Dylan Thomas's <span class="italic">Under Milk Wood</span> and other triumphs, but her work was consistently admired, her services often sought. She began early with a BBC radio serial, <span class="italic">The Scoop</span> (1931). Had she started later, she might have been still more successful as a writer for television, for she had an even better eye for a striking image than an ear for convincing dialogue.<br>
<br>Clemence Dane had many talents. She wrote some fiction in collaboration with Helen Simpson; she was a good artist (her bronze bust of Ivor Novello is in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London); she was the author of anthologies, one a book about the blitz (<span class="italic">The Shelter Book</span>, 1940). She wrote <span class="italic">London has a Garden</span> about Covent Garden (where she lived for more than thirty years). She turned out novels right up to <span class="italic">Bonfire</span> (published posthumously, 1981). She wrote feminist essays (<span class="italic">The Women's Side</span>, 1926), literary criticism (including <span class="italic">Tradition and Hugh Walpole</span>, 1929), and finely crafted short stories in <span class="italic">Fate Cries Out</span> (1935). Her best novels all deal with the stage: <span class="italic">Broome Stages</span> (1931, seven generations of an acting dynasty), <span class="italic">Enter Sir John</span> (a detective story involving an actor&#150;manager, 1931 with a 1932 sequel), and <span class="italic">The Flower Girls</span> (1954, children of a first family of the theatre).<br>
<br>Winifred Ashton was made a CBE (1953) but Clemence Dane has yet to be appreciated fully. The feminists may win her a place: <span class="italic">Regiment of Women</span> was republished (1995) in Virago's <span class="roman">Lesbian Landmarks series</span>. She died at her home, 1 Draycott Place, Chelsea, London on 28 March 1965. One of her executors was Olwen Bowen-Davies.<br>
