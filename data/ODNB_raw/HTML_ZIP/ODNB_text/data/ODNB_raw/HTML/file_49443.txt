<span class="headword">Moninne</span> <span class="st"> [St Moninne, Darerca]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 517), <span class="occ">nun</span>, was an Irish saint who has been identified with <a href="#cosubject_49443">St Modwenna of Burton [<i>see below</i>]</a>. According to the life of the saint contained in the fourteenth-century <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span>, which appears to preserve the earliest account, Moninne, or Darerca, was the daughter of Mochta, a nobleman of the Conailli Muirthemne, an Irish population group settled in the area of modern co. Louth. She took the veil at the hands of St Patrick, founded the monastery of Killevy in south Armagh, and, according to the annals of Ulster, died in 517.<br>
<br>Moninne's original religious community consisted of eight virgins and a widow, with the widow's child, Luger, later a bishop. This group received instruction, first from a local priest, later from St Ibar, and lived under his tutelage successively in the western islands, at Begerin (Wexford), and at the unidentified &#145;Ard Conais&#146;. Attracted by the reputation of St Brigit, Moninne and her companions also spent time at her monastery at Kildare. The community eventually returned from Leinster to the north of Ireland, settling first at Faughart, then at Killevy. Here the number of nuns grew to over 150 and here Moninne died on 5 July 517. The miracles attributed to her include the production of food and drink, protection against robbers, prophecy, and converse with angels. According to the life in the <span class="roman">Codex Salmanticensis</span>, her hoe, spade, rough garments, and comb were preserved in her monastery of Killevy and were brought out as war talismans when invaders threatened the region. The nunnery survived until the Reformation and the annals of Ulster mention the death of a &#145;coarb [successor] of Moninne&#146; in 1077.<br>
<br>Another account of Moninne's life, written by Conchubranus (about whom nothing is known except that he wrote prior to 1100), transforms this simple story. Conchubranus introduces more Irish saints, including, in defiance of all chronology, Columba. He transforms Brigit from Moninne's model into one of her early followers, here presumably using statements about the relative status of the two saints to make claims about the relative status of their two churches, Killevy and Kildare. Most significantly, Conchubranus attributes to Moninne a much wider geographical range of activity. In addition to three trips to Rome, the saint is now endowed with a southern Scottish career and also brought to Mercia, the west midlands, where she is tied in with the neighbourhood of Burton upon Trent. Most modern commentators assume, with plausibility, that three separate saints have been conflated in this new career spanning the three kingdoms.<br>
<br>Conchubranus also elaborates upon Moninne's genealogy, giving the name of her mother as Coman, daughter of King Dallbronach, and depicting her father as an important ruler in Ulster and identifying him as a member of the lineage of &#145;Hilech&#146; (perhaps Ailech, the seat of the kings of Cen&eacute;l n&Eacute;ogain, although Dallbronach does not appear in their genealogies). The saint's Scottish activities in this developed version include the founding of numerous churches, including some at such significant &#145;high status&#146; sites of central Scotland as Dumbarton, Stirling, and Edinburgh. The site of her death is transferred to another of her foundations, &#145;Lonfortin&#146; (perhaps Luncarty in Perthshire). No Scottish religious house of the later middle ages can be traced back to any of her supposed foundations.<br>
<br>It is not clear when and how the identification was made between the founder of Killevy, who died in 517, and <a name="cosubject_49443"></a><span class="headword">St Modwenna <span class="st"> [Modwen]</span> of Burton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>before 12th cent.), whose bones were enshrined in the abbey of Burton upon Trent. Conchubranus's version, in the sole surviving manuscript (a copy made at or for Burton in the early twelfth century), reports that, after the saint had cured Alfred, son of an English king, she came to England and was rewarded by the grant of land in the Forest of Arden. Her bones, according to this account, lay on the island of Andresey, in the Trent by Burton. Local tradition, as represented by the version of the saint's life and miracles written by Geoffrey, abbot of Burton (1114&#150;50), asserted that the saint was translated into the abbey church of Burton in the eleventh century and that her shrine there became the centre of miraculous healing and of miraculous punishments of those who intruded upon Burton's rights and property. Later medieval evidence of the cult at Burton includes a thirteenth-century Anglo-Norman version of Modwenna's life by Geoffrey, a chapel on the island of Andresey, and, within the abbey, an altar and an image, which were removed at the Reformation.<br>
