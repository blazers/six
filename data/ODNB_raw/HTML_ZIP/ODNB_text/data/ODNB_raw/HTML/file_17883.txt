<span class="headword">Malym <span class="st"> [Malim]</span>,  William</span>  (1533&#150;1594), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was the son of Henry Malym of Staplehurst, Kent. He was educated at Eton College from about 1544, was accepted as a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, on 14 August 1548 and graduated BA in 1553. On 11 January 1555 Malym was discommuned from King's for an unknown offence, but was reinstated after two weeks and graduated MA the following year.<br>
<br>In 1561 Malym was appointed headmaster of Eton College. His role in the provocative selection as the college's provost of the Roman Catholic sympathizer Richard Bruarne in 1561 is unclear, but&#151;unlike Bruarne&#151;he remained in office. Malym was the author of a <span class="italic">Consuetudinarium</span>, or account of the rules of the college, which bears his name on the fly leaf and which was probably intended as a guide for the commissioners who visited the school in 1561. The work is a vital source for the customs of the Eton calendar and the routines of school life. It reveals that the day began at 5 a.m., and that much of the instruction of younger pupils was in the hands of the senior boys of the seventh or highest form, styled <i>praepositores</i>. It also shows that features of the old religion survived at Eton in 1561. Each of the boys had a confessor, on the basis that &#145;confession is a wholesome medicine for the sinner&#146;, as Malym explained approvingly, though this passage was later crossed through  (Lyte, 148). Other features of school life did not change. The day remained extremely long, holidays were meagre, and Latin and Greek dominated the curriculum.<br>
<br>On her visit to Eton in September 1563 Queen Elizabeth was presented with a collection of Latin verses by the scholars, who asked that she look favourably on &#145;our dearest master, by whose kindness and extreme watchfulness, by day and night, we have attained such proficiency in literature&#146;, hoping that he should not &#145;be ground down by ceaseless labours and studies&#146;  (Lyte, 169). It may be doubted whether the students' plea was inspired by spontaneous gratitude for the master's tender care. The tradition of flogging, established under its most celebrated practitioner Nicholas Udall, was continued enthusiastically by Malym, his former pupil. In a meeting at Windsor about this time, William Cecil reported that &#145;divers scholars of Eton be run away from that school for fear of beating&#146;, news which provoked a debate on the value of the birch, and stimulated Roger Ascham to write <span class="italic">The Scholemaster</span>  (Ascham, preface, sig. B2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Most historians of Eton have thought that Malym's headship finished in 1563, but Sterry lists his tenure as lasting until 1571. On his own account Malym travelled to Turkey in 1564, convincing himself of the &#145;cruelty and beastly behaviour&#146; of the natives, &#145;having been among them more than 8 months together&#146;  (Daye, preface). He toured widely, visiting Antioch, Cyprus, the Aegean Islands, and Venice. There is also a second report of &#145;his great travayle by sea and land unto Hierusalem. Where he was made knight of the sepulchre as appeareth by his letters patent dated at Jerusaleme the 13th day of September &hellip; 1564&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 1116, fol. 69<i>v</i>). Such protracted travels suggest that Malym had left Eton altogether. On 3 April 1569 he was installed in the prebend of Biggleswade in the diocese of Lincoln, an appointment most unusual for one who had not been ordained. When, a few days earlier, Malym had written to thank Cecil for using his influence with the earl of Leicester in his behalf, it was probably in regard to this benefice.<br>
<br>On 19 and 20 January 1573 a meeting of the court of the Mercers' Company was held at St Paul's School, London, which discussed the appointment of a new high master in succession to John Cook. The bishop of London, Edwin Sandys, and the archdeacons of Essex and Middlesex were asked to choose between William Malym and Ralph Waddington. Malym was preferred, and took up his appointment on Lady day 1573. It seems possible that Christopher Holden, the &#145;surmaster&#146; or usher, was resentful at being thus passed over. Whatever the reason, it is clear that the two men were at loggerheads, and in 1575 it proved necessary to appoint arbitrators to resolve contentions between them. But the trouble, which centred on rights of access to the Mercers' lodgings, continued. In 1576 the Mercers' court resolved the dispute. The school was now accommodating boarders, and it is possible that this had been inaugurated by Malym.<br>
<br>It was on 13 April 1578, while master of St Paul's School, that Malym was married to Mary Strete, at the church of St Thomas the Apostle in London. Mary died before him, for in his will Malym named one Alice as his wife. Malym had two daughters and two sons, of whom one, Dudley, was completely disinherited and disowned by his father as &#145;undutiful, unthankful and unnatural&#146;. Among Malym's pupils at St Paul's were the soldier Sir Francis Vere, and Sir Thomas Chaloner, later chamberlain to Prince Henry, whose book <span class="italic">De republica Anglorum instauranda</span> was edited by Malym in 1579. Malym also translated from the Italian a pamphlet on the siege and capture of Famagusta in Cyprus by the Turks, published by John Daye as <span class="italic">The True Report of All the Successe of Famagosta</span>, with an epistle dedicated to the earl of Leicester dated 23 March 1572. Malym contributed commendatory letters or verses for <span class="italic">Demosthenis Graecorum</span>, by Nicholas Corr (1571), and for Edmund Grant's <span class="italic">Spicilegium</span> (1575). In 1578 he delivered an oration in Latin to the Dutch military leader John Casimir on his visit to London.<br>
<br>In February 1580 Malym wrote to Alexander Nowell, dean of St Paul's, asking for release from his duties at the school, but this was not granted. On 29 May 1581 he appeared before the wardens of the Mercers and requested to be discharged, asking them to find a successor within the next twelve months. Malym had constructed a polyglot lexicon for the students, in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and high Dutch, for which the college paid 19<i>s</i>. on his departure in autumn 1581. Malym died shortly before 15 August 1594, when he was buried at the church of All Hallows-the-Less, Thames Street, London.<br>
