<span class="headword">Paget,  Nathan</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1615, <em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Manchester and baptized on 31 March 1615, the son of the puritan divine, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21119/', "Thomas Paget (d. 1660)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21114/', "Paget, John (d. 1638)")</script>], rector of Stockport, Cheshire, and St Chad's, Shrewsbury, and his wife, Margery Goldsmith (1588&#150;1628). His uncle, John Paget (<i>d</i>. 1638), was minister of the Amsterdam Presbyterian church from 1607 to 1637. His early education was under the tutelage of Richard Pigot at Northwich grammar school, Cheshire. He subsequently graduated MA at Edinburgh University in 1635, and on 25 November 1638 he entered Leiden University as a student of medicine, and graduated MD there on 3 August 1639. Paget's thesis, &#145;De peste&#146; (1639), was dedicated to his father and various puritan ministers and laymen in Cheshire and Shropshire. On his return to England he practised at first outside London and was admitted an extra licentiate of the College of Physicians on 4 April 1640. He was incorporated MD at Cambridge on 3 June 1642, and was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians on 4 November 1646. Almost certainly sympathetic to the new regime, Paget was nominated physician to the Tower by the council of state of the Commonwealth on 31 December 1649. Best known, perhaps, as the friend of John Milton, to whom he introduced his cousin who became Milton's third wife, Paget probably shared his reformist religious inclinations. In 1662, for example, through his friendship with the Quaker Isaac Penington, he secured the services of the young Quaker Thomas Ellwood to act as a reader to the near-blind poet. Moreover, his residence in Coleman Street, London, was certainly well known as a haunt of radical puritans; and his extensive library of over 2000 works, which was dispersed after his death, contained a large number of heterodox works dating from the 1640s and 1650s. Further evidence of Paget's parliamentarian and puritan sympathies is provided by the evidence of his subscription to the solemn league and covenant in his parish of St Stephen's, Coleman Street, in 1643, as well as his marriage to Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1614), the daughter of Sir Philip Cromwell of Ramsey, Huntingdonshire, a first cousin of the lord protector. Paget's attendance on the miraculous Baptist maid, Sarah Wight, in London in 1647 is also suggestive of a man with radical puritan interests and connections.<br>
<br>Little is known of Paget's medical practice, though the evidence which survives would appear to point to a man sympathetic toward the contemporary movement in favour of medical reform and innovation. In 1647, just six months after his election as fellow of the College of Physicians, he presented the college with a three-volume edition of the works of Francis Bacon. He also contributed, along with seven other physicians, to Francis Glisson's pioneering work on the rickets, first published in 1650. Interest in therapies other than Galenism is also suggested by Paget's ownership of large numbers of chemical and alchemical treatises, as well as by the fact that in 1651 he was lending rare chemical manuscripts to Elias Ashmole. Further evidence of his radical inclinations in this respect are suggested by his acquaintance with Samuel Hartlib, with whom he communicated in 1651. None the less, he remained an active figure within the tradition-bound College of Physicians, acting as censor in 1657, 1659, 1669, and 1678, and serving as an elect from 1667 until 1677. On 20 September 1663 he was designated Harveian orator for the following year. Paget died at his home in Coleman Street in January 1679 and was buried in the same month. The main beneficiary of his will, dated 7 January 1679, and proved eight days later, was his brother Thomas Paget, clerk, to whom he bequeathed property in Shropshire and London. He also gave &pound;20 a year for thirty years to the president and fellows of the College of Physicians, as well as &pound;20 to his cousin Elizabeth Milton.<br>
