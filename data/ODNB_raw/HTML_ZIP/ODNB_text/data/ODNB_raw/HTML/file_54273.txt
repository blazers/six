<span class="headword">Livingston, Sir  Alexander, of Callendar</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1375, <em>d.</em> in or before 1456), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, was the eldest of four sons of the first marriage of Sir John Livingston of Callendar (<i>fl</i>. 1371&#150;1402) to a daughter of John Menteith of Kerse. It is likely that Alexander was born in Stirlingshire about 1375 at the latest as Sir John's second marriage occurred in 1381. The family's principal estate was Callendar, near Falkirk. Alexander was probably knighted on the return of James I from captivity in England in 1424, but neither he nor any son of his acted as a hostage for the king's ransom, as happened with many Scottish barons. Although he played little part in political life under James I, the assassination in 1437 of King James (succeeded by the six-year-old James II) and the subsequent deaths of various senior members of the Scottish nobility opened the way for hitherto little-known men to make their mark. Livingston was apparently so enraged by the queen mother's marriage to Sir James Stewart of Lorne less than a month after the death of Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Douglas, the lieutenant-general of the realm, in June 1439, that he arrested her and imprisoned Stewart and his brother in Stirling Castle. Despite the severity of the act, in September 1439 a settlement was concluded between the Livingstons and the queen mother, with the approval of the three estates, whereby the king was to reside in Stirling Castle under Livingston's guardianship until his majority. The possession of the king was a crucial gain.<br>
<br>The chancellor, Sir William Crichton (<i>d</i>. 1454), was now Livingston's only real rival at court. Together, however, they engineered the execution of the sixth earl of Douglas on 24 November 1440. There can be no doubt that they worked with the connivance of Douglas's great-uncle James Douglas, earl of Avondale (<i>d</i>. 1443), already a significant court figure. He became seventh earl of Douglas and acted to improve the lot of his own sons, including William, eighth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1452), who began to ally himself with Livingston. The replacement of Crichton as chancellor by James Bruce, bishop of Dunkeld, in 1444 removed the last check on the Livingstons, notwithstanding the presence of the eighth earl of Douglas. Their power can be clearly seen in the distribution of offices acquired during the 1440s, many of which would have brought pensions to their holders. Sir Alexander was justiciar from about 1444 and sheriff of Stirlingshire by 1448. His son and heir, James, was captain of Stirling Castle by May 1442, keeper of the king's person by March 1445, and chamberlain by June 1448. Other family members held the posts of constable of Stirling Castle, captain of Methven and Doune castles, Perthshire, sheriff of Fife, and king's comptroller (the financial officer responsible for the maintenance of the royal household). Beyond the immediate family, the custumar of Dumbarton burghs, the keepers of the castles of Dumbarton, Dunoon in Argyll, Restalrig in Edinburghshire, and Kildrummy in Aberdeenshire, and the master of the king's household were Livingston associates or relatives.<br>
<br>This stranglehold on government, particularly in central Scotland, came to a dramatic end in 1449. James Livingston and three others were arrested on 23 September, and Sir Alexander and Robert Livingston, the comptroller, soon afterwards. After a trial in parliament in January 1450 Robert and Sir Alexander's second son, Alexander, were executed. Sir Alexander, who may later have been expelled from Scotland, and James Dundas of Dundas, probably his brother-in-law, were imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle. The terms of a remission in 1452 suggest a plot against the persons of the king or queen, although there has also been speculation that the Livingstons abused their power for financial gain.<br>
<br>Sir Alexander Livingston's death is usually dated about 1451, but as his son is not styled of &#145;Callendar&#146; in a Scottish source until September 1456 a date in mid-1456 is preferable. He is said to have married a daughter of Dundas of Dundas and had two sons, James and Alexander, and four daughters. Of the daughters, Janet married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54227/', "James Hamilton of Cadzow")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54222/', "Hamilton family")</script>] and Joanna married Sir John Sibbald of Balgonie, master of the king's household. Livingston had attempted to found a collegiate church at Falkirk, obtaining papal approval in 1449, but following his family's loss of power the project foundered.<br>
<br>Sir Alexander's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54273"></a><span class="headword">James Livingston</span>, first Lord Livingston  (<em>c.</em>1400&#150;1467), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, who may never have been knighted, was first brought to prominence at court by his father. After the fall of the family in 1449 he was imprisoned in Holyrood, only to escape and associate himself with his son-in-law, the lord of the Isles, in attacking royal castles in the north in 1451. His reward was the keepership of the nominally royal castles of Inverness and Urquhart, Inverness-shire. The Livingstons nevertheless received a general remission of rancour from the crown in August 1452, James II being now engaged in his struggle with the Douglases. James's rehabilitation was marked by his reappointment as chamberlain by March 1454; while he continued in office until his death, it seems that before the 1460s he entrusted the conduct of chamberlain ayres to deputes because he was constantly at court. He was sheriff of Stirlingshire by mid-1455 and master of the king's household from at the latest October 1455, both posts held until the end of 1460.<br>
<br>It is surprising that only in March 1458 (not in 1455 as traditionally stated) was he created Lord Livingston, especially given the Livingston dominance in the 1440s when many Scottish families adopted a peerage style. In April 1458 the free barony of Callendar was created for Lord Livingston by consolidation of his estates in Stirlingshire, Lanarkshire, and Perthshire. After the king's death in August 1460 Livingston is seldom found at court, although he remained chamberlain and was appointed ambassador on occasion. His exclusion may have resulted from the personal animosity towards him of the queen mother, Mary of Gueldres. If this is true it may help explain the fall of his family in 1449, three months after the arrival of the queen in Scotland.<br>
<br>James Livingston died about August 1467. He is known to have married Marion (<i>d</i>. between June and October 1478), daughter of Thomas Berwick, a burgess and custumar of Edinburgh. She had apparently married first Sir John Oliphant of Aberdalgie (<i>d</i>. 1446) and may therefore have been Livingston's second spouse. His children included James, second Lord Livingston, whose idiocy prevented the family from returning to prominence in the remainder of the century, and Elizabeth, who married John MacDonald, earl of Ross and lord of the Isles.<br>
