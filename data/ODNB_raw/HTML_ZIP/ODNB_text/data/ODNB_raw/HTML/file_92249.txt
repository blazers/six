<span class="headword">Kelly,  David Christopher</span>  (1944&#150;2003), <span class="occ">microbiologist and weapons inspector</span>, was born on 14 May 1944 at Llwynypia Hospital, Llwynypia, Glamorgan, the son of Thomas John Kelly, a schoolteacher then serving as a signals officer in the RAF Volunteer Reserve, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 5 Mount Zion, Tunbridge Wells. Both died when he was young, and he was brought up by his grandparents in south Wales, and educated at the County Grammar School for Boys in Pontypridd. From there he went to the universities of Leeds, where he graduated BSc in bacteriology, and Birmingham, where he took an MSc in virology. On 15 July 1967 he married Janice Vawdrey, a 22-year-old fellow student (training to be a geography teacher at Bingley Teacher Training College), and daughter of Wilfred Vawdrey, progress clerk. They had three daughters, Sian and the twins Rachel and Ellen.<br>
<br>In 1968 Kelly joined the insect pathology unit at Oxford University, where he completed his DPhil on the iridoviruses of insects in 1971. He then spent three years at the University of Warwick, working on the multiplication of influenza virus with Nigel Dimmock, before returning to Oxford as a chief scientific officer at the Institute of Virology. There he and colleagues worked on the development of insect viruses as a means of pest control.<br>
<br>In 1984 Kelly became head of the microbiology division at the Ministry of Defence's Chemical Defence Establishment (from 1991 the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment) at Porton Down, Wiltshire. He oversaw a significant expansion in the size of the division, the successful completion (in 1986) of the decontamination of Gruinard Island, off Wester Ross, where the UK had conducted tests with anthrax during the Second World War, and the strengthening and diversification of the division's other activities. He was closely involved in the debriefing of Soviet defectors (most notably Vladimir Pasechnik in 1989) who gave evidence of a covert biological weapons programme in the Soviet Union, in direct contravention of the biological and toxin weapons convention of 1972. He then co-led the Anglo-American inspection team that visited a range of civilian facilities in Russia in accordance with the trilateral agreement signed by the USA, the UK, and the newly post-communist Russia in 1992. His patient investigative work helped establish the scale of the Russian programme, despite continuing obstruction from the Russian authorities, but the work was left incomplete when in 1994 Russia baulked at allowing visits to military facilities.<br>
<br>&#145;When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, little did I realise that Saddam Hussein would dictate the next ten years of my life&#146;, Kelly later said  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 19 July 2003). He led the first team of United Nations biological weapons investigators to Iraq in 1991, under the terms of the ceasefire arrangements provided for by UN security council resolution 687, and helped uncover Iraq's anthrax production programme at Salman Pak, and the main biological weapons site at al-Hakam, 60 kilometres south-west of Baghdad. Until 1998, when Iraq ceased further co-operation with the United Nations special commission on Iraq (Unscom), and Saddam Hussein singled Kelly out by name for expulsion, Kelly was a key figure in the United Nations investigation and uncovering of the Iraqis' biological weapons programme. He was (unusually for a government scientist) appointed CMG in 1996, and nominated for the Nobel peace prize. In all he visited Iraq thirty-seven times (the last in June 2003, after the American-led invasion of March that year). He loved Iraq, its culture, its people, and its literature, though he loathed the Iraqi regime.<br>
<br>In his youth Kelly had been a keen sportsman, and he remained a keen musician (playing double bass and later saxophone). He was also a skilled gardener. A member of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; faith in later life, he was at one time treasurer of the spiritual assembly in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, near his home in Southmoor; he regularly played cribbage at his local pub, the Hind's Head. With his soft voice, twinkling eyes, and semantic precision, and his unfashionable brown shoes, saggy but comfortable pullovers, and ancient silver rimmed spectacles, he could have been the man from the welfare, but both the Russians and the Iraqis soon learned to their bitter cost that to underestimate Kelly was a mistake. His quiet persistence and avuncular nature made him the perfect interrogator. He treated everyone with respect and dignity, some humour, and never a threat. He often conducted six-hour interviews with only short coffee breaks, but with the exception of Rihab Taha (the head of Saddam Hussein's biological weapons research, whom Kelly reduced to hysterical tears), no one complained. Because of the nature of his work he was in frequent contact with journalists, though his views were rarely attributable, and he avoided broadcast interviews. His use of language was always precise, and no journalist could ever entice him to exaggerate or use hyperbole. His views were based either on hard facts or on highly intelligent analysis of incomplete information.<br>
<br>Following the winding-up of Unscom, Kelly returned to his position as chief adviser on biological defence and warfare matters to the Ministry of Defence's proliferation and arms control secretariat (he had given up his position as head of the microbiology division at Porton Down in 1994, as a result of his full-time involvement in Unscom work) and continued to advise the government and the UN on the Iraqis' weapons programme. It was in this position that he was interviewed by a number of journalists in the late spring of 2003 about the joint intelligence committee dossier on the weapons of mass destruction possessed by Iraq. The dossier was prepared in the run-up to the American-led invasion, and had played a key role in the government's justification for the war. On 22 May 2003, at the Charing Cross Hotel, London, he met Andrew Gilligan, a BBC journalist. At this meeting Kelly threw doubt on the dossier's claim that Iraq was capable of launching biological and chemical weapons within forty-five minutes of an order to use them&#151;reflecting widespread scepticism on this point within the scientific and intelligence communities&#151;and indeed on the extent of Iraq's continuing biological warfare capability since the last Gulf War.<br>
<br>Gilligan broadcast his report on the BBC's <span class="italic">Today</span> programme on 29 May 2003, claiming that the government had deliberately &#145;sexed up&#146; the dossier through the inclusion of the forty-five-minute claim, even though it knew the claim was doubtful. On 1 June he followed this up with an article for the <span class="italic">Mail on Sunday</span> in which he named the prime minister's director of communications and strategy, Alastair Campbell, as the key figure in the decision to include this claim. Gilligan's allegations prompted a political furore. The government responded by demanding to know the source of Gilligan's story. The BBC stood by its report. At the end of June, Kelly confessed to his superiors that he had met Gilligan, though he was &#145;convinced that I am not his primary source of information&#146;  (&#145;Report of the inquiry&#146;, point 257). The government then issued a statement saying that someone had come forward who might be the source, but whose views did not correspond with those reported by Gilligan. The announcement contained sufficient clues for journalists to guess that that person might be Kelly&#151;and the government then, highly unusually, confirmed his identity. The consequent publicity forced Kelly and his wife to flee to Cornwall, but he was called back to appear before the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee on 15 July, and its intelligence and security committee on 16 July. At his first appearance, which was open to the public, he was subjected to some notably hostile questioning and appeared under severe stress, speaking so quietly that the air-conditioning equipment had to be turned off. He admitted meeting Gilligan, but denied that he had said the things Gilligan reported his source as having said. He also denied being the source for some quotations used by Susan Watts, another BBC journalist, who had reported the story for <span class="italic">Newsnight</span> on 2 June.<br>
<br>On his last morning, 17 July, at home with his wife, Kelly was not an unhappy man. He sent wry but quite optimistic emails to close friends: he was looking forward to his daughter's wedding and, as ever, to returning to Baghdad. But at some stage in the morning he received a telephone call which changed everything. The most likely explanation is that he learned from a well-meaning friend at the Ministry of Defence that the BBC had tape-recorded evidence which, when published, would show that he had indeed said the things to Susan Watts that he had formally denied saying. Kelly must surely have realized instantly that he would be found out&#151;if he had lied about one quotation then he probably could not be trusted about others&#151;and his efforts to protect his reputation and survive the scandal would end immediately. At about 3 p.m. he told his wife he was going for a walk. He went to Harrowdown Hill, about a mile from his home, where it appears that he ingested a large (but not fatal) quantity of co-proxamol, a painkiller, then cut his left wrist. His body was found early the next morning. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Longworth. He was survived by his wife, Janice, and their three daughters.<br>
<br>On 18 July the government immediately announced an inquiry into the events leading up to Kelly's death, to be led by Lord Hutton. The inquiry opened on 1 August, and took evidence from numerous witnesses, with cross-examination by QCs representing the inquiry, the government, the BBC, the Kelly family, and Gilligan. The final report, published on 28 January 2004, criticized the Ministry of Defence for not warning Kelly that his identity would become public, but was &#145;satisfied that Dr Kelly took his own life&#146;  (&#145;Report of the inquiry&#146;, point 467) and exonerated the government and Alastair Campbell from the specific charge made by Gilligan, that the government had included the forty-five-minute claim despite knowing it was wrong. Deciding that any failures in the intelligence provided to the government were outside his remit, Hutton reserved his greatest condemnation for Gilligan, and for the editorial and management processes at the BBC, which he described as &#145;defective&#146;  (&#145;Report of the inquiry&#146;, point 291). The Hutton report led to the immediate resignation of the chairman of the BBC, Gavyn Davies, and within two days to the resignations of Greg Dyke, the director-general of the BBC, and Gilligan, though none expressed agreement with the findings of the report.<br>
