<span class="headword">Viccars,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1604, <em>d.</em> 1653?), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was baptized on 30 October 1604 at Treswell, Nottinghamshire, the second of four children of Gregory Viccars (<i>d</i>. after 1612), yeoman. He entered as pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge, in July 1618, graduating BA in 1622. He was incorporated at Lincoln College, Oxford, on 24 February 1625 and proceeded MA on 28 March. By 1627 he was rector of St Mary's, Stamford, Lincolnshire, where he earned the enmity of some parishioners who in 1628 denounced him as a heretic. This led to his trial before Bishop Laud and others at the court of high commission in November 1631. He was convicted of keeping conventicles and of heresy and was sentenced to be removed from office, defrocked, and fined &pound;100. Viccars spent several years in prison after, and possibly before, this trial, but in November 1635, after submitting and recanting, he was through the good graces of Laud restored to the ministry (though forbidden to serve at Stamford) and was forgiven the fine.<br>
<br>Soon after this Viccars embarked on extended scholarly travels in France and Italy. He examined manuscripts in Paris, Rome, Florence, Venice, and other Italian cities, and he consulted scholars such as Athanasius Kircher in Rome and learned Jews at Venice, Leghorn, Bologna, and elsewhere. The result of this was Viccars's sole publication, <span class="italic">Decapla in psalmos</span>, completed in 1638 and published in London in 1639, an erudite and voluminous commentary on all 150 psalms using ancient, medieval, and modern versions in ten different languages, including Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic. Much of the commentary is extracted from rabbinical authors, but under the heading &#145;alius auctor&#146; (&#145;another author&#146;) Viccars provides his own remarks, which include, besides extensive classical quotations, sidelights on his travels with descriptions of monuments and eyewitness accounts of Vesuvius, the Alps, and other natural marvels. The book cost John and his younger brother Samuel much money for Syriac and Arabic types specially cast (the latter only the second Arabic font produced in England) and a fine engraving by Wenceslas Hollar for the title-page. <span class="italic">Decapla in psalmos</span> was dedicated to Laud and it was presumably as a reward that Viccars was presented to the rectory of South Fambridge, Essex, on 30 May 1640. However, his conversion to Laudian orthodoxy was soon overtaken by the civil war: among the accusations made against him before the Essex county committee on 16 April 1644 was that he was a Roman priest, because he had been at Rome. He was sequestered and he perhaps never again held a benefice, for it is not certain whether the John Viccars who was instituted as rector of Battlesden, Bedfordshire, 5 May 1645, is the same man.<br>
<br>Viccars may have been living in London in 1652 when he was named by Brian Walton in the prospectus for the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> as one of those to be employed in preparing the copies. However, it is likely that he died soon afterwards for there is no trace of his participation in the published work, which was issued between 1653 and 1657. The &#145;second edition&#146; of <span class="italic">Decapla in psalmos</span> (1655) is simply the sheets of the 1639 edition reissued by a new publisher, omitting the dedication to Laud, and it may well be posthumous. Viccars was certainly dead by 1660 when a successor to him was appointed at South Fambridge. He seems never to have married, but through the two marriages of his elder sister, Helen, the second to the nonconformist minister Obadiah Grew, he became uncle to the physician Henry Sampson and the scientist Nehemiah Grew.<br>
