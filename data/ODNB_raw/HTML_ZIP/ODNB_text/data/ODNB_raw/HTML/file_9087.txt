<span class="headword">Fairfax,  John</span>  (1804&#150;1877), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician in Australia</span>, was born at Warwick on 25 October 1804, the second son of William Fairfax of Birmingham and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jesson. He was reared a Congregationalist. After a short time spent at school he was apprenticed, at the age of twelve, to William Perry, printer and bookseller in Warwick. Having served his time he went to London and from 1825 worked briefly on the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. His next step was to set up as printer and bookseller in Leamington, near his home and friends. On 31 July 1827 he married Sarah, daughter of James Reading of Warwick; they had three sons and one daughter. In 1828 he founded, with James Sharp, the <span class="italic">Leamington Spa Courier</span> (Sharp soon dropping out). In 1835 he became part owner of the <span class="italic">Leamington Chronicle and Warwickshire Reporter</span>. In 1836 he successfully defended a libel action, but the costs bankrupted him. He and his family emigrated, arriving at Sydney, New South Wales, in September 1838 with &pound;5.<br>
<br>Fairfax became librarian to the Australian Subscription Library in April 1839 and soon resumed his journalistic activities. In February 1841, with Charles Kemp, he bought the <span class="italic">Sydney Herald</span> (for which he was already writing), changing its name in 1842 to the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>. It was soon established as the leading paper of eastern Australia. In 1851 Fairfax visited Britain, paid off his debts, and became something of a celebrity in Warwickshire. He returned to Sydney with the first steam press to be used in Australia. In 1853 he bought out Kemp's interest in the <span class="italic">Herald</span> and took on his eldest son, Charles Fairfax, as his partner. He broadened his base, developing interests in insurance, banking, and utilities. A deeply religious person, he was president of the Young Men's Christian Association in Sydney, and was a deacon in the Congregational church. He stood unsuccessfully in 1856 for election to the legislative assembly but accepted nomination in 1874 to a seat on the legislative council.<br>
<br>In 1858 Fairfax built Ginahgulla in Bellvue Hill, Port Jackson. He died there on 16 June 1877, and was buried in Rookwood cemetery; his wife predeceased him. His two surviving sons carried on the <span class="italic">Herald</span>, by then one of the best-known newspapers of the British empire.<br>
