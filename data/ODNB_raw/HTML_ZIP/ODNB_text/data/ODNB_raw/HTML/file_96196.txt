</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Best,  George</span>  (1946&#150;2005), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born on 22 May 1946 at the Royal Maternity Hospital, Belfast, the elder son and eldest of six children of Richard (Dickie) Best (1919&#150;2008), an iron-turner in the Harland and Wolff shipyard, and his wife, Ann Mary (Annie), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Withers (1922&#150;1978), who worked in Gallaher's tobacco factory. He was originally named Ronald Samuel Best, but two weeks after his birth was renamed George.<h2>
<a name="BelfastandManchester"></a>Belfast and Manchester</h2>The Best family lived on the newly built Cregagh council estate in east Belfast, a predominantly protestant area. They were Free Presbyterians who attended church twice on Sundays; as a teenager George Best joined the protestant Orange order. His father was a keen amateur footballer and his mother played hockey to almost international standard, but Best credited his maternal grandfather, George Withers, with encouraging his passion for football. Family photographs show the young Best kicking a ball at the age of about fifteen months. Later he played football in the street, or in a field behind the family home, and honed his skills by dribbling a tennis ball to and from school. It was said that he even took a football to bed with him.<br>
<br>Best attended Nettlefield primary school and won a scholarship to Grosvenor High School, a grammar school where he often played truant because it was a rugby school and because his daily journey took him through a Catholic area where he suffered taunts and stone-throwing. After a year he was transferred to Lisnasharragh intermediate school, a secondary modern school where he played for the football team. He also began playing for Cregagh Boys' Club, and earned a reputation for dedicated practice. Advised that his left foot was weak, he spent several days wearing a plimsoll on his right foot and a football boot on his left, hitting a tennis ball until both feet were equally strong.<br>
<br>Although the teenage Best drew admiration for his dribbling he was considered too frail to become a professional player, and was rejected by the Belfast club Glentoran. &#145;I looked like a stick of rhubarb&#146;, he later said. &#145;I weighed about seven stones&#146;  (Parkinson, 14&#150;15). When he was fourteen, however, a friend of his father, Bud McFarlane, recommended him to Bob Bishop, the scout in Northern Ireland for one of England's top clubs, Manchester United. Bishop, too, was worried about Best's physique, but then successfully tested him in games against older and bigger players. &#145;I think I've found you a genius&#146;, Bishop is said to have told Matt Busby, the United manager, by telegram  (B. Best, 62).<br>
<br>In July 1961, a week after qualifying to become a printer's apprentice, Best crossed the Irish Sea for a two-week trial in Manchester. It began badly: United officials neglected him on his arrival, and Best felt homesick. Within forty-eight hours he returned to Belfast, but his father gently encouraged him to go back to Manchester. For the next two years Best remained an amateur with United, since Football Association rules barred Irish players from becoming professional until they were seventeen. Initially he worked as an errand-boy for the Manchester Ship Canal Company, and later he was given a bogus job with a local electrical firm. Yet within five months of becoming professional (in May 1963), and having played barely a few games for the reserves, Best had made his d&eacute;but in the United first team&#151;a 1&#150;0 win over West Bromwich Albion at United's Old Trafford ground on 14 September 1963. Although he played well it would be more than three months before he appeared for the first team again. On Boxing day 1963 United had been thrashed 6&#150;1 at Burnley, and Busby made radical changes for the return fixture two days later. Best scored the first goal as Manchester United beat Burnley 5&#150;1, and he stayed in the side thereafter.<h2>
<a name="Footballinglegend"></a>Footballing legend</h2>Best possessed a wide range of skills, including pace, acceleration, stamina, and physical strength. He beat defenders easily with an extraordinary control that made it look as if the ball was tied to his feet, and his repertoire of feints, swerves, and spurts once prompted his team-mate Pat Crerand to say he left opponents with &#145;twisted blood&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Nov 2005). Above all he had remarkable balance, and an elasticity that enabled him to bounce back quickly from the ground, ride challenges, and avoid serious injury. He was never afraid to tackle, could head the ball, was a master at passing, and deadly in front of goal. Although he was a shy and very private character he showed huge confidence even in his youth, unaffected by noisy crowds. He frequently played on the wing, especially in his early career, and could easily play as a forward, but was often given licence to roam the midfield. What made him special was his showmanship: to him football was entertainment. Crowds loved his cheeky, mischievous smile, and the way he played with his socks around his ankles. They responded with loud, expectant roars whenever he got the ball. His weaknesses were a tendency to perform unnecessary tricks, and an occasional selfishness that stopped him passing to colleagues who were better placed. He also had a volatile temperament.<br>
<br>In a Manchester United career that lasted just over ten years Best scored 179 goals in 470 competitive appearances. He joined the side amid Matt Busby's rebuilding following the 1958 Munich air crash, in which eight players were killed. Along with Bobby Charlton and Denis Law he was one of the 1960s &#145;holy trinity&#146; of world-class forwards who helped restore United to greatness. He won two English championship medals, in 1965 and 1967, but it was in Europe that he really made his mark. Perhaps his greatest game was United's European cup quarter-final in March 1966 against Benfica, the Portuguese champions, in Lisbon. Matt Busby warned his players against taking risks, but they produced an astonishing 5&#150;1 win. Best scored twice in the opening minutes, and took most of the headlines. &#145;George just went out and destroyed them&#146;, said Busby. &#145;I ought to have shouted at him for not following instructions, but what could you say?&#146;  (Lovejoy, 95&#150;6). He was still only nineteen.<br>
<br>George Best&#151;Georgie to fans, or sometimes Geordie in Ireland&#151;soon became English football's first modern superstar, part of the &#145;swinging sixties&#146;, and it was said that his appearance added from 5000 to 10,000 to the attendance at any Manchester United fixture. It was an era when managers weren't used to handling wealthy stars whose fame extended beyond football, and here lay the seeds of Best's downfall. &#145;It might have been better if Matt had been harder on me&#146;, he later remarked. &#145;The normal laws of the club didn't seem to apply to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blessed</span>, 114). Endowed with the perfect surname and blue eyes, he grew his hair long like the Beatles; indeed he was sometimes called the fifth Beatle. Although he still lived in the modest council home of his United club landlady, Mary Fullaway, in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, he was the 1960s &#145;man about town&#146;, wearing fashionable clothes and driving expensive sports cars. Like the Beatles he attracted screaming schoolgirls, though when many of them wrote requesting a lock of hair, he responded with tufts shorn from the Fullaway family's black dog. Over the years his many lovers included famous actresses, two holders of the Miss World title, and several married women who were a lot older than him, including the wife of the prominent Manchester QC George Carman (who would later unsuccessfully defend Best in an assault case).<br>
<br>Best soon needed three secretaries to handle his fan mail. He was one of the first footballers to employ a commercial agent, and before long his income from outside activities outstripped his player's wages. He wrote ghosted columns for several newspapers and magazines, and in 1966 opened the first of several fashion boutiques in Manchester. He modelled clothes, too, and over the next few years he advertised sausages, oranges, aftershave, his own brand of football boots, and even women's bras. The Egg Marketing Board used him to promote eggs for breakfast, under the slogan &#145;E for B and Georgie Best&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 10 May 2008).<br>
<br>During the 1967&#150;8 season Best was joint leading scorer in the English league, with twenty-eight goals (and four more in other competitions), a remarkable tally for a winger. At the end of the season, in May 1968, he scored his team's second goal as Manchester United became the first English club to win the European cup, with a 4&#150;1 win over Benfica at Wembley Stadium. It was a typical Best strike, as he knocked the ball through a defender's legs and then dribbled round the goalkeeper. That year Best was chosen as footballer of the year in both England and Europe, the youngest player to win either award.<br>
<br>Best's contribution to Manchester United's victory in the European cup, ten years after the club had lost almost a whole team at Munich, would prove to be the pinnacle of his achievements, even though he was barely twenty-two. &#145;Although I was not to know it at the time&#146;, he would subsequently admit, &#145;it was the beginning of the end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Where Do I Go From Here?</span>, 13). He had a sense that there was nothing else to do at United. Busby stepped down as manager, but released from the burden of Munich the club seemed to lack ambition: the supply line of youth players dried up and United failed to exploit the transfer market. For five successive seasons Best was the team's top goalscorer, but felt the side relied too much upon him. &#145;I was finding it increasingly difficult to get motivated as the team was so poor&#146;, he later confessed  (<span class="italic">Blessed</span>, 141).<br>
<br>Frustrated with football, Best adopted a more carefree lifestyle. First signs came with a succession of driving offences, one of which led to a six-month ban. This was followed by increasingly regular disciplinary measures, by Manchester United for missing training sessions, and by the football authorities for offences on the pitch. His bookings and dismissals were rarely for malicious conduct, but often stemmed from anger that referees weren't giving him protection from the violent attempts of defenders to stop him. In 1970 he was suspended for a month for knocking the ball out of the referee's hands after a defeat by Manchester City. On his return he scored six times as United won 8&#150;2 in an FA cup tie at Northampton Town. Nevertheless by this time he had started to drink heavily, often all night long. Among his favourite haunts were the Brown Bull, a pub in the centre of Manchester, whose landlord gave him a key so that he could drink as he pleased, and Phyllis's, an unlicensed club that was open all hours. The pressure grew with the troubles in Northern Ireland, and a serious death threat delivered before a game at Newcastle in 1971.<br>
<br>Best left his club landlady to live in a futuristic house he had had built in Bramhall, equipped with numerous electronic gadgets. But the property was too exposed, and he felt trapped in a &#145;goldfish bowl&#146; by gawping fans outside  (<span class="italic">Where Do I Go From Here?</span>, 117). Before long he was annoying team-mates such as Bobby Charlton, who felt that Busby and his successors as manager, Wilf McGuinness and Frank O'Farrell, treated him too leniently. Relations got so bad that Charlton and Best rarely passed the ball to each other. If he had lived in later decades Best would almost certainly have moved to a leading Spanish or Italian club, but this was an era when there was little international movement in players. An alternative might have been a transfer to one of the big London clubs, since he loved playing in the capital, but Best felt huge loyalty to Manchester United.<br>
<br>Best found little solace in playing for Northern Ireland, for whom he had made his d&eacute;but against Wales on 15 April 1964. Aged just seventeen, he was then the youngest player ever to appear for his country. He envied his Manchester United team-mates Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles, who had helped England win the world cup in 1966, and he feared, rightly, that he would never achieve much with his national team. Northern Ireland never qualified for the world cup finals or the final stages of the European championship during the years he was at his peak. His best game for Northern Ireland was probably a 1&#150;0 win over Scotland in October 1967, but he rarely performed well for his country. &#145;Recreational football&#146;, he later called his Northern Ireland games  (Lovejoy, 162). He played in just thirty-seven international matches between 1964 and 1977, and scored nine goals, but had he played for a more successful country, it might have extended his ambitions, career, and reputation.<br>
<br>In May 1972 Best announced from holiday in Majorca that he was giving up the game. &#145;I am no longer a footballer&#151;and that is final&#146;, he declared  (Lovejoy, 227). It took only two weeks for Manchester United to persuade him to change his mind, but he was far less effective the following season. When Best again skipped training United first fined him and then put him up for sale for &pound;300,000. It was a sign of his unreliability that the club received no offers, and shortly afterwards Best again announced his retirement from English football. He toyed with the idea of playing in North America, but in the summer of 1973 Busby and the latest Manchester United manager, Tommy Docherty, again persuaded him to return to the club. He trained hard, but this latest comeback did not last long. In January 1974 he missed training once more and was dropped for a cup tie, though it is disputed whether he was then sacked or quit. He had played his last game for Manchester United in a 3&#150;0 defeat at Queen's Park Rangers on new year's day 1974. He was twenty-seven, an age when most players approach their peak, but he would never play top-flight English football again.<h2>
<a name="Decline"></a>Decline</h2>Best continued to live in Manchester, where he had opened his first nightclub, Slack Alice's, in 1973, and a second, Oscar's, the following year. Gambling became his latest addiction, and he would often fritter away his clubs' nightly takings in a nearby casino. The sums were huge: one night he was losing &pound;17,000, only to finish &pound;9,000 in profit. Yet it was only a temporary retirement from football. Over the next decade his career stuttered on, as he played for more than a dozen different clubs on five different continents. In many cases these were purely money-making ventures, involving just a handful of games, and Best would be excused from training. Such deals were struck with a club called the Jewish Guild in Johannesburg, South Africa (1974), followed by Dunstable Town (1974&#150;5) and fourth division Stockport County (1975) in England, and then Cork Celtic (1975&#150;6) in Ireland. He was next lured by the emerging North American Soccer League, which had already attracted such ageing world-class stars as Pele and Franz Beckenbauer. For the next six years Best spent the summer months playing in the United States, with the Los Angeles Aztecs (1976&#150;8), the Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1978&#150;9), and the San Jose Earthquakes (1980&#150;81), for whom he also played indoor six-a-side football. In all he played 150 competitive games in the USA, and scored fifty-seven goals. He combined this American summer football with winter performances in Britain. Between 1976 and 1978 he played for the London second division club Fulham, and scored ten goals in forty-seven games. In 1979 and 1980 he also scored three times in twenty-two matches for the Edinburgh club Hibernian.<br>
<br>These were years of sad decline, as Best became slower and overweight, and more troubled by his addictions. He enjoyed the anonymity of living in America, where he settled in Hermosa Beach, and in 1977 opened a beach bar called Bestie's. During long drinking sessions in California he would disappear for days, walking or hitch-hiking from one clandestine bar to another, going without food, and sometimes sleeping in doorways and on the beach. Often he went penniless, and later admitted that he was once so desperate for a drink that he stole money from a woman's purse. There were violent mood swings, though he would often go for several months without drink, and he also felt guilty for neglecting his mother. She had died in 1978 of a heart attack that was probably brought on by alcoholism, and Best wondered whether his own troubled life had driven her to drink. The same year Best married Angela MacDonald (Angie) Janes, from Essex. They had one son, Calum, born in 1981 (the year in which Best entered a rehabilitation clinic in Los Angeles, the first of many), but separated a year later and divorced in 1986. After Best's death his sister revealed that he had also fathered a daughter back in 1969, though he never met her, and her identity has never been made public.<br>
<br>Occasionally crowds saw flashes of the old Best brilliance. While playing for San Jose in 1981, when his drinking problems were acute, he scored what many regard as the greatest goal of his career. Playing against his former club, Fort Lauderdale, he dummied left and right, shaking off every defender in his path, before shooting past a helpless goalkeeper. That same year he entered negotiations about returning to the English first division, to play for Middlesbrough, with an eye to returning to the Northern Ireland squad that had just qualified for the 1982 world cup finals. In 1983 he was also approached by Manchester United about yet another comeback. After giving the idea &#145;serious thought&#146;, he declined, fearing &#145;I might go back and make a fool of myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blessed</span>, 269). Instead he played five games for third division Bournemouth, and had brief spells with two teams in Hong Kong, non-league Nuneaton Borough in England, and two clubs in Australia. His last competitive match was for Tobermore United in Northern Ireland in 1984. &#145;It was a freak show&#146;, Best later said of these nomadic years. &#145;People were coming to see me fall over, or whatever. The problem was that I had to do it. I needed the money&#146;  (Lovejoy, 305).<br>
<br>For most of his post-football years George Best lived in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, where his personal troubles worsened. In 1984 he was imprisoned for eight weeks for assaulting a policeman in an argument over a drink-driving offence. Another humiliating moment occurred in 1990 when he appeared on the BBC chat-show <span class="italic">Wogan</span> and, obviously drunk, told viewers &#145;I like screwing&#146;  (Lovejoy, 341). In 1982 he was declared bankrupt in an action taken by the Inland Revenue over an unpaid tax bill for &pound;22,000. By 1991 he was estimated to have debts of &pound;100,000, though his bankruptcy was discharged the following year. His fortunes were restored with the help of his partner from 1987 to 1995, Mary Shatila, who acted as his agent in securing personal appearances. Best employed his wit and high intelligence to become a pundit on football, notably for Sky Television, and also delivered after-dinner speeches and stage shows, often in a double-act with Denis Law and his Fulham team-mate Rodney Marsh. He produced half a dozen editions of autobiography and reminiscences. On 24 July 1995 he married Alexandra Jane (Alex) Pursey, an air stewardess who was less than half his age, but they divorced in 2004 after she accused him of violence.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Best's final years were a battle against his addictions, which involved regular trips to health farms (where he still managed to drink), and programmes of anti-abuse tablets sewn into his stomach. But the restoration of his finances only encouraged more gambling. When friends raised &pound;20,000 at a testimonial dinner he lost it all the same night at a casino. At times he seriously contemplated suicide. In 1999 he was found to have severe cirrhosis of the liver. The following year he was admitted to hospital in London and came close to death, and in 2002 he was given a liver transplant, on the understanding that he would give up alcohol. He failed to do so. In October 2005 he entered the Cromwell Hospital in London for the last time, suffering from a kidney infection that was a side-effect of the drugs taken for his liver transplant. He spent seven weeks in intensive care, and he allowed one newspaper to photograph his haggard condition to warn people off drink. He died on 25 November 2005. The cause of death was a combination of pneumonia, septicaemia, multi-organ failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. His funeral, in Belfast on 3 December 2005, was almost a state occasion, with a service held at the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont, broadcast live on British television. An estimated 100,000 people watched the cort&egrave;ge pass through the streets to Roselawn cemetery.<br>
<br>The Brazilian player Pele, who perhaps deserved the title himself, once described Best as &#145;the greatest footballer in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 Nov 2005). Certainly he is a prime contender as the greatest player in British history. Comparisons are difficult, as his early departure from the English first division and his absence from top international tournaments probably ensured that he never reached his true potential. &#145;I spent a lot of my money on booze, birds and fast cars&#146;, he once joked. &#145;The rest I just squandered&#146;  (Smith and Hunt, 59). He was the archetypal flawed genius. He was one of the most talented and entertaining players of the twentieth century, yet he was brought down by his other obsessions&#151;sex, gambling, and especially drink.<br>
<br>Best's life was portrayed in the film <span class="italic">Best</span> (2000), starring John Lynch, and celebrated in the 1970 song &#145;Belfast Boy&#146;, by Don Fardon. In 2006 the harbour airport in Belfast was renamed George Best Belfast City Airport. He was featured on a limited edition five pound banknote issued by Ulster Bank on the first anniversary of his death. He was also depicted on several of Northern Ireland's murals, a distinctive form of political street art of this period, and featured in a three-man statue at Old Trafford, alongside Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. There is a plaque on the family home in Burren Way, Belfast. The George Best Foundation was established in 2006 to help research into liver disease and alcoholism, and to promote football as an alternative to drink and drugs.<br>
