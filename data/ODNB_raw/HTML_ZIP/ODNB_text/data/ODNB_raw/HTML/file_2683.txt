<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blount,  Charles</span>, eighth Baron Mountjoy and earl of Devonshire  (1563&#150;1606), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53018/', "James Blount, sixth Baron Mountjoy (1532/3&#150;1581)")</script>, nobleman [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2682/', "Blount, Charles, fifth Baron Mountjoy")</script>], and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1576), daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of St Oswald's, Yorkshire. He later claimed that he was, from an early age, acutely aware of his venerable family's declining reputation and worsening financial straits. In a childhood portrait he reputedly insisted on being painted holding a trowel with the motto <i>Ad reaedificandam antiquam domum</i>, or, &#145;To restore the family fortunes&#146;  (Jones, 21), written beneath the picture. He is said to have studied at Oxford, but failed to attain a degree. Instead he travelled to London to study law and entered Clifford's Inn, transferring to the Middle Temple on 20 June 1579. Blount's elder brother, William, had been living in London for some time and introduced his provincial brother to the ways of the court. On one occasion, about 1583, the handsome Charles caught the attention of Queen Elizabeth, who remarked to him &#145;faile you not to come to court, and I will bethinke my self, how to doe you good&#146;  (Naunton, 132). He availed himself of this rare opportunity for advancement and was instantly catapulted from obscurity to the centre of English social and political life.<h2>
<a name="Thereluctantcourtier"></a>The reluctant courtier</h2>Despite a retiring disposition and a proclivity to immerse himself in study Blount was a success as a courtier, but his rapid rise provoked the jealousy of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7565/', "Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex")</script>, the queen's favourite. Following Blount's conspicuous display of a gift given to him by the queen, Essex quipped, &#145;now I perceive every foole must have a favour&#146;  (Naunton, 120). Hearing of this affront Blount challenged Essex to a duel, emerging unscathed while the latter suffered a flesh wound. His successful defence of his honour was a rite of passage that won him the respect of other courtiers, including the influential Essex. About this time Blount began his political career, representing St Ives, Cornwall, where his brother owned land, in the 1584 parliament. But parliamentary service proved too mundane a pursuit for Blount, who was eager to distinguish himself through military service. The opportunity came in 1585 when he accompanied Sir John Norris on a campaign in the Low Countries, serving as a captain. Norris had become something of a father figure to Blount, who devoted himself utterly to the respected general. In October 1585 he was wounded in a skirmish after rashly deserting his command to aid Norris. He returned to England, but resumed his command some months later and was present when Sir Philip Sidney received his fatal wound near Zutphen in September 1586. Following this he again returned to England and represented Bere Alston, Cornwall, in parliament in October 1586. But the lure of glory compelled him to return once again to the Low Countries, where he remained for much of 1587. Unhappy with his long absences from court the queen recalled him in October. He was knighted by the earl of Leicester prior to his return to England.<br>
<br>Not content with the monotony of court life Blount regularly absented himself from the queen's company to pursue his military career. The threat posed by the Armada in summer 1588 allowed him another opportunity to distinguish himself in combat. Like many of the younger nobility he rallied to England's defence and provided financial backing for the construction of ships. According to one historian he was given command of a London man-of-war, the <i>Lion</i>, against the invaders, although in another account he served as a volunteer aboard the <i>Rainbow</i>. The queen rewarded him by appointing him keeper of the New Forest in 1588 and one of the queen's gentlemen pensioners in 1589. He was also created MA at Oxford in 1589. His appointments were designed to dissuade him from pursuing his military ambitions but the desire to become a respected soldier and leader of men overrode other considerations. When in 1593 Blount's former company in the Low Countries and Norris were deployed against the Spanish in Brittany, he abandoned the court&#151;and his duties as MP&#151;to join them in secret. The queen had explicitly forbidden such behaviour and in a letter to Norris in June 1593 insisted that Blount be sent back to England. The queen, according to Naunton, scolded him upon his return, warning him, &#145;you shall go when I send you; in the mean time, see that you lodge in the court where you may follow your books, read, and discourse of warre&#146;  (Naunton, 59). Though confined to court he was left fully salaried as a captain and in nominal control of nearly a thousand men in Brittany. This punishment, cloaked in royal favour, was a humiliating setback for Blount. Events in 1594, however, allowed him to establish an identity independent of queen and court.<h2>
<a name="EighthBaronMountjoy"></a>Eighth Baron Mountjoy</h2>The death of Henry Ratcliff, earl of Sussex, in December 1593 left the governorship of the town of Portsmouth vacant. The continued threat of an amphibious Spanish landing in southern England made Portsmouth a strategically important position while transforming its governorship into a prestigious appointment. The queen&#151;sufficiently confident in his abilities&#151;appointed Blount governor of Portsmouth in January 1594. On 27 June that year Blount's brother William, who had succeeded his father as Baron Mountjoy, died unexpectedly, so allowing Blount to inherit the title as eighth baron. Thus a prominent military appointment and his elevation to the peerage at last afforded Mountjoy a degree of independence from court and allowed him to re-establish his military reputation. At Portsmouth he vigorously put into practice many of the military strategies he had carefully studied: he oversaw the construction and renewal of fortifications and honed his naval skills. At an administrative level he became a parliamentary patron both at Bere Alston and at Portsmouth, where, as high steward, he nominated one of the two members of the 1597 parliament, in which he himself sat as Lord Mountjoy in the House of Lords. Yet Mountjoy's independence was far from complete: he was specifically forbidden to accompany Essex on his expedition to Cadiz in 1596. But in April 1597 he was created a knight of the Garter and, that summer, received the queen's permission to accompany Essex on an expedition to the Azores, where he was made lieutenant of the land forces. Though the Azores voyage ended in fiasco Mountjoy's reputation emerged unblemished.<br>
<br>Over the course of the expedition Mountjoy's friendship with Robert Cecil, the queen's secretary, had strengthened and, aware of his influence with the queen, he implored Cecil &#145;to continue his good opinion and not to repent the course he has hitherto held to advance her Majesty's gracious inclination toward him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 7.470). In affiliating himself with Cecil, however, Mountjoy risked alienating the opposing court faction led by his former rival, and recent commander, Essex, whose reputation had been dealt a crushing blow following the Azores d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. For Cecil, Mountjoy doubtless represented a potentially valuable ally: he was the queen's intelligent and capable favourite who lacked the domestic influence and pretensions of Essex. For two years Mountjoy managed to keep safely outside this dangerous rivalry without committing himself openly to either faction. In doing so, however, his rapid ascent faltered: he remained governor of Portsmouth, but without the backing of a court faction he was denied an appointment to the privy council and was thus deprived of any real power. This lull in his career, compounded by the stalemate at court, was ultimately broken by events in Ireland which, by August 1598, demanded immediate attention.<br>
<br>The rebellion by Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, posed the most serious threat yet faced by the Tudors in Ireland and required the swift dispatch of a strong deputy to crush the rebels and restore order. It was initially thought that Mountjoy would receive the appointment and in November 1598 he was actually nominated by the council; but it was inevitable that Essex&#151;due as much to his political stature and military experience as his recent military failure and aggressiveness with the queen&#151;would go to Ireland, where either redemption or ruin awaited. Essex's appointment did not, as expected, push Mountjoy towards the Cecil faction; rather their friendship grew stronger. In a letter written to Essex prior to his departure Mountjoy remarked, &#145;I fear not, since needs go you must, but that your virtue shall beget as great a necessity for your welcome home&#146;  (Jones, 46). He became increasingly involved in Essex's plan to force the queen to acknowledge King James of Scotland as her successor. In summer 1599 he dispatched a secret messenger to Scotland to inform James that Essex supported his succession to the English throne. The queen could not live for ever, and, for Mountjoy, an alliance with Essex and the future king would ensure a prominent position in the new administration. But Mountjoy was not a traitor. His loyalty to Essex and his desire to secure James's succession did not amount to a willingness to topple Elizabeth. Essex, however, had grown increasingly desperate following his manifest failure to defeat Tyrone and by October 1599 he was confined to court. Charles was subsequently offered the Irish deputyship; he accepted the post in November and was scheduled to depart within twenty days. In desperation Essex urged Mountjoy, who looked after his fortunes during his confinement, to employ his newly assembled army against the queen's councillors; but Mountjoy prevaricated and eventually departed for Ireland in February 1600 leaving Essex and his intrigues behind.<h2>
<a name="LorddeputyofIreland"></a>Lord deputy of Ireland</h2>The direction of the campaign against Tyrone had been decided prior to Mountjoy's arrival in Ireland. He was to oversee the reform of a demoralized army and open up new fronts against the rebels through the plantation of strongly defended garrisons deep within rebel territory; vital to this strategy was the plantation of two garrisons supported by sea behind Tyrone at Lough Foyle and Ballyshannon. The nature of Mountjoy's position, moreover, was to be fundamentally different from that of his predecessors: military power, formerly consolidated in the deputy, was immediately decentralized to avoid a scenario where one slow moving, unwieldy English force could be outmanoeuvred or counter-attacked by smaller Irish contingents. The plan's immediate implementation, however, was delayed due to shortages of victuals and money and Mountjoy's wrangling with the Irish council; in March the exasperated lord deputy wrote to Cecil, &#145;if I were aided by a council of Solomons, I think this Kingdom and this army, as they now are, would afford them matter enough to try their best wits&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/207(2)/28). Mountjoy, however, remained focused on the task at hand and by September his cautious and calculated implementation of his military objectives had taken their toll on Tyrone. His level temperament and careful attention to geographical detail&#151;coupled with an inherent awareness of the dire consequences that one poorly judged march might bring&#151;had denied Tyrone any opportunity to exploit the Irish terrain or English military conceit to his advantage. In an effort to undermine Tyrone's economic base Mountjoy ravaged the Irish countryside unsparingly, a tactic which he employed to its greatest limits with cold precision and fixity of purpose that amounted almost to a blind automatism  (Jones, 78). Fynes Moryson, Mountjoy's secretary in Ireland, described the deputy as &#145;courtly, grave, and exceedingly comely&#146;; he was &#145;of stature tall, and of very comely proportion, his skin faire, with little haire on his body &hellip;, and thinne on his head, where he wore it short, except a locke under his left eare, which he nourished the time of this warre&#146;, with good table manners, a man who &#145;tooke Tobacco abundantly&#146;, and favoured &#145;private retirednesse, with good fare, and some few choice friends&#146;  (Moryson, <span class="italic">Itinerary</span>, 2.261&#150;3).<br>
<br>When word came of Essex's failed rebellion in early 1601 Mountjoy panicked and prepared a ship in which he planned to escape from Ireland to France. But despite his complicity in Essex's early plans to ensure James's accession he had suitably distanced himself from Essex prior to the rebellion and his role in the affair was overlooked. His favourable relationship with the queen was doubtless a factor in the suppression of evidence against him; but ultimately it was his success in Ireland that insulated him from the charges that claimed Essex and his fellow conspirators. Victory in Ireland, however, was far from certain and Mountjoy understood that both his career and reputation had become wholly dependent on a decisive victory over Tyrone. Yet drawing Tyrone into an open confrontation proved difficult; only the arrival of Spanish reinforcements commanded by Don Juan D'&Aacute;guila in the coastal town of Kinsale in September 1601 prompted Tyrone to abandon his defensive position in Ulster and make the impossibly long march south to link up with the Spaniards. The long-awaited confrontation was imminent, but the arrival of about 3400 Spaniards was a worrying development for Mountjoy, who raced to dislodge them. He invested Kinsale in October as Tyrone began his southerly descent. But the Spaniards clung on stubbornly and by December Mountjoy's army was suffering from disease and shortages of food. A winter cessation of hostilities seemed likely, but Tyrone, who had assembled a force of some 6500 men, committed himself to open field combat outside Kinsale on 24 December. The Spaniards failed to counter-attack from Kinsale and Mountjoy's troops routed Tyrone's forces. Though he had gained the most spectacular victory of his career, effectively breaking any organized military resistance, he offered the rebels no quarter and doggedly pursued them as they limped back to Ulster. In September 1602 he destroyed the O'Neill inauguration stone at Tullaghoge to symbolize his victory over both Tyrone and the Gaelic order.<br>
<br>Tyrone submitted unconditionally in December 1602 and was received, in March 1603, at Mellifont, where he made his formal submission, on his knees, to Mountjoy, the queen's representative. The queen, however, had died nearly a week prior to Tyrone's submission; Mountjoy had concealed her death both to prevent Tyrone from holding out for more favourable terms and to safeguard Tyrone's interests from his enemies who might seek to renegotiate the submission under the new king. Mountjoy hoped to rehabilitate Tyrone and employ him as a stabilizing influence in an Ireland devastated from years of war. He acted, in the main, as a voice of reason among the vulture-like English adventurers who descended on Ireland in the wake of Tyrone's defeat, and set about laying the foundations of a new system of government. Following James I's accession, however, Mountjoy sought his immediate recall; he was made lord lieutenant of Ireland and a privy councillor in April 1603, which allowed him to return to England. Before he departed he was faced with serious rioting in Cork which spread to the other major towns. The towns&#151;which had, crucially, remained staunchly loyal throughout the rebellion&#151;bore the brunt of the economic collapse following Tyrone's defeat and were forced to maintain garrisons. The preponderantly Catholic townsmen, moreover, hoped that James's accession would herald a return to Catholicism; but in the meantime they produced ancient municipal charters to assert their independence and prevent Mountjoy's intervention in their affairs. Mountjoy, who, Moryson remarked, &#145;would cut King John's charter in pieces with King James' sword&#146;, acted quickly to suppress the potentially dangerous revolt and brought the towns to submission  (Moryson, <span class="italic">History of Ireland</span>, 2.337). He then departed for England where, upon his arrival in June, he presented the &#145;arch-traitor&#146; Tyrone to James I.<h2>
<a name="EarlofDevonshirescandalanddeath"></a>Earl of Devonshire, scandal, and death</h2>On 21 July 1603 an appreciative king created Mountjoy earl of Devonshire. To this distinction were added lucrative sinecures and substantial grants of land in both England and Ireland. In May 1604 he was appointed to a commission which negotiated a peace with Spain and in November of the following year a nervous James I nominated him to defend the crown against the insurrection which it was thought might follow the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. Though an insurrection failed to materialize Devonshire presided over the investigation into the affair. In these later years he maintained an interest in learning and was a regular patron of poets: John Davies published a sonnet to him in his <span class="italic">Microcosmus</span> in 1603 and in 1605 Nicholas Breton dedicated to him &#145;The honour of valour&#146;. Following his triumph in Ireland Devonshire had, it appeared, achieved the financial security, the respect, and the military distinction that he had sought so persistently in his youth. His scandalous involvement with a married woman, however, plagued him to his death and besmirched his otherwise impeccable reputation.<br>
<br>On 26 December 1605 Devonshire married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23490/', "Lady Penelope Rich (1563&#150;1607)")</script>. Lady Penelope was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7568/', "Walter Devereux, first earl of Essex")</script>, and was sister of the late second earl of Essex. She had been Devonshire's lover from at least 1590 despite her marriage to Robert, Lord Rich, in 1581. All parties had overlooked their questionable relationship until Lord Rich obtained a divorce from Penelope in the ecclesiastical courts in November 1605. Devonshire then sought to legitimize their relationship, and their five children, by marrying Penelope, and, although an ecclesiastical divorce did not permit remarriage, he persuaded William Laud, his chaplain, to perform the rite. A scandal ensued. In his defence Devonshire wrote a tract, dedicated to the king, in which he appealed to scripture and to protestant divines to justify his reasons for marrying Penelope, but to no avail. The scandal&#151;coupled with a falling out with Cecil in early 1606&#151;made Devonshire a social pariah whose future was uncertain. In March 1606 he travelled to London to visit Cecil, but became stricken with a respiratory infection&#151;doubtless aggravated by years of heavy smoking&#151;and died at Savoy House in the Strand on 3 April 1606. According to Chamberlain he left this life &#145;soon and early for his years, but late enough for himself: happy had he been if he had gone two or three years since, before the world was weary of him, or that he had left his scandal behind him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials of Affairs of State</span>, 2.206). He was buried in St Paul's chapel of Westminster Abbey on 7 May and in his honour John Ford wrote a poem entitled &#145;Fames memorial, or, The earle of Devonshire deceased&#146; while Samuel Daniel composed &#145;A funeral poeme upon the death of the late noble earle of Devenshyre&#146;.<br>
<br>As his marriage was unrecognized Devonshire's children were deemed illegitimate and his titles became extinct at his death. He provided generously for Penelope and his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2692/', "Mountjoy Blount")</script>, received a substantial inheritance. His other children, St John, Charles, Penelope, and Isabella also received an annual sum out of his vast estate. Devonshire had successfully reversed the financial decline of his noble house and had completed the transformation from a favoured Tudor courtier to a respected general and statesman, but his domestic misery and early death prevented him from becoming a figure of major importance.<br>
