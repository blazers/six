<span class="headword">Whitford,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1543?), <span class="occ">Bridgettine monk and author</span>, probably came from near Whitford in Flintshire. According to his will (previously attributed to an uncle of the same name) made in 1511 before he entered Syon Abbey, he had lands in Flintshire and in Lancashire which he left to his sister's son, John Edwards. Nothing else is known about his parentage, family, early life, or education until he is recorded as a questionist at Cambridge University in 1496&#150;7. From 1498 to 1504 he was a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge. In 1498 he was granted leave of absence to accompany William Blount, fourth Lord Mountjoy (<i>d</i>. 1534), to study abroad and that same year Whitford was admitted BA by Paris University and proceeded MA in 1499. While in Paris Whitford and Mountjoy became friendly with Erasmus who accompanied them back to England that summer. Whitford returned to Queens', was incorporated MA at Cambridge and became dean of chapel, junior bursar (1500&#150;01) and senior bursar (1501&#150;2) of his college. The only hint about his life between leaving Queens' and entering Syon Abbey, probably about 1511, comes from William Roper's life of Sir Thomas More, repeated by Nicholas Harpsfield (Roper, 8; cf. Harpsfield, 16). They told how More went to see Richard Fox, bishop of Winchester, and then fell into conversation &#145;with Master Whitford, his familiar friend, then Chapleine to that bishoppe, and after a Father of Syon&#146;, but no documentary evidence has been found to confirm that Whitford was Foxe's chaplain.<br>
<br>The next glimpse of Whitford comes from Thomas Bedyll, one of Thomas Cromwell's agents, charged with securing the submission of the brethren of Syon to the <span class="roman">Acts of Succession and Supremacy</span>. On 21 July 1534 he reported:<blockquote>I handled Whitford &hellip; in the garden bothe with faire wordes and with foule, and shewed him that throughe his obstinacy he shuld be brought to the greate shame of the world for his irreligious life, and for his using bawdy wordes to diverse ladys at the tymes of their confession, whereby (I sayed) he myght be the occasion that shrift shalbe layed downe throughe England: but he hath a brasyn forehed, whiche shameth at nothing. (Wright, 49)</blockquote>Again, on 28 August Bedyll reported from Syon that &#145;one Whitford preached&#151;one of the most wilful&#151;and said nothing of the King's title&#146;, declaring that he had little learning and was a great railer  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 7, no. 1090). However, Whitford remained at Syon until its suppression in 1539 and received one of the higher pensions of &pound;8 a year. There is no evidence as to where he spent the last years of his life; tradition places him in the Mountjoy household. According to the Syon martyrology  (BL, Add. MS 22285, fol. 55<i>v</i>) he died on 16 September, almost certainly in the year 1543 since his pension ceased to be paid on 3 October 1543.<br>
<br>Whitford's donation to the brothers' library at Syon, was comprehensive but commonplace: classical authors predominated, especially Cicero, scholastic works by Lombard and Lyre, sermon collections by Bromyard and Gisland, and two spiritual compendia, Busti's <span class="italic">Mariale</span> and the <span class="italic">Rosetum exercitionum spiritualium</span>; less predictable was Petrus Crescentius's <span class="italic">De agricultura</span> and the only trace of humanist interest was the <span class="italic">Cornucopia</span> by the fifteenth-century Italian scholar and papal secretary Nicolaus Perottus. Yet his scholarship and critical acumen were approved by two of the most learned men of his day, for Erasmus asked Whitford to judge between his and Thomas More's responses to Lucian's <span class="italic">Pro tyrannicida</span> (printed in Paris, in 1506, and dedicated to Whitford).<br>
<br>Whitford was sensitive to English style, making new translations of St Augustine's rule and St Bernard's <span class="italic">Golden Epistle</span> which had been brought to him &#145;in englysshe of an olde translacyon, rugh and rude&#146;. He also pointed out that works might be attributed to men like St Bernard to enhance their authority. Much of his published work was translation: Augustine's rule with Hugh of St Victor's commentary (1525, 1527), the Syon version of the Sarum martyrology (1526), and works attributed to saints Bernard and Bonaventure, Isidore, Chrysostom, and Bernard Sylvester; lengthy quotations from scripture, the fathers, and classical authors were also embedded in his works. Although he has been credited with the popular sixteenth-century translation of Thomas &agrave; Kempis's <span class="italic">Folowynge of Chryste</span>, that attribution seems to be the consequence of the inclusion by the printer, Robert Redman, of a different version of <span class="italic">The Golden Epistle</span> &#145;nat of the translation nor edicion of this auctor&#146; in his <span class="italic">Werke of Preparacion &hellip; unto Comunion</span> (1531?) accompanied by the statement &#145;it is in some bokes imprynted in the later ende of the boke called in latyn Imitatio Christi that is to say in Englisshe the folowyng of Christe&#146;  (Whitford, <span class="italic">A Werke of Preparacion</span>, sig. G2<i>v</i>). Nor is it likely that Whitford was the translator responsible for <span class="italic">A Looking Glace for the Religious</span>, because its author, Ludovicus Blosius (<i>d</i>. 1566), was considerably younger than him.<br>
<br>Whitford was well aware of the benefits of print. He was repeatedly asked to copy <span class="italic">A Dayly Exercyse and Experyence of Dethe</span>, but found the task &#145;very tedyouse: I thought better to put it in print&#146;  (Whitford, <span class="italic">A Dayly Exercyse</span>, sig. A1<i>v</i>). He had his works printed in the same format so that they could easily be bound together. But writing at a time when Lutheran texts in English were beginning to circulate and finding one included among his works displacing his own, he repeatedly warned his readers to beware anonymous publications. He added his name to his works not out of pride but for accountability, and the references to his sources that pepper the margins of his works were probably included for the same reason. Because he wrote in English and had his works printed they travelled far beyond the confines of Syon, into other cloisters and into lay households.<br>
<br>Most of Whitford's subjects were quite traditional, but written with a keen appreciation of the dangers and needs of the church on the eve of the Reformation. His substantial treatise on the religious life, <span class="italic">The Pype or Tonne of the Lyfe of Perfection</span> (1532), also provided a strong defence of that life against Lutheran detractors. His <span class="italic">Dayly Exercyse and Experyence of Dethe</span> (1534?, 1537, 1538?) was better structured, more practical, and more positive than traditional <i>ars moriendi</i> books. But it was his <span class="italic">Werke for Housholders</span> (1530?, 1530, 1531?, 1531, 1533, and twice in 1537) and related <span class="italic">Werke of Preparacion or of Ordinaunce unto Comunion or Howselyng</span> (1531?, 1537, 1537?) that broke new ground and established him as the devotional best-seller of the 1530s. Here he turned his attention to the needs of devout lay people and placed the onus for religious instruction, good behaviour, and daily prayer with the householder, as later protestant writers such as Thomas Becon (<i>d</i>. 1567) and the recusant <span class="italic">Manual of Prayers</span> were to do. Although Whitford's expectations of lay piety were perhaps rather unrealistic he did recognize some of the practical problems of crowded household conditions and sought to make his instructions and meditations adaptable to various needs. Although doctrinally conservative, Whitford's works suggest the way in which the English church was adapting to the changing world of the sixteenth century before it was overtaken by the Reformation.<br>
