<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arkell,  William Joscelyn</span>  (1904&#150;1958), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in Highworth, Wiltshire, on 9 June 1904, the youngest of a family of seven of James Arkell, brewer, and his wife, a talented artist, Laura Jane, daughter of Augustus William Rixon, a London solicitor. From an early age Arkell displayed a keen interest in natural history, explored the countryside, and collected insects, plants, and fossils. At Wellington College, Berkshire, he was an enthusiastic member of the school's natural history society. At New College, Oxford, he made geology and palaeontology his special subjects, receiving much encouragement from W. J. Sollas, then professor of geology. In 1925 he gained the only first-class honours of his year in geology and was soon awarded the Burdett-Coutts scholarship, which opened the way for research in his chosen field. In 1929&#150;33 he was lecturer in geology at New College, an appointment which enabled him to devote most of his time to research, and thereafter he held senior research fellowships at New College (1933&#150;40) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1947&#150;58). He received the DSc degree of the University of Oxford in 1934. In 1929 he married Ruby Lilian (1908&#150;1984), daughter of S. R. S. Percival, of Boscombe, Hampshire. The couple later had three sons.<br>
<br>Arkell's name will long be associated with the study of the rocks of the Jurassic system and their fossils. His earliest work was on the Corallian beds of Oxfordshire and neighbouring counties and his first paper, which dealt with certain fossil bivalve molluscs from these strata, appeared in 1926. It was the forerunner of his voluminous <span class="italic">Monograph of British Corallian Lamellibranchia</span>, published by the Palaeontographical Society between 1929 and 1937. His first stratigraphical paper, dealing with the same area of Corallian rocks, was published in 1927 in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>. It was soon followed by contributions on the Cornbrash (with J. A. Douglas) and on the Great Oolite. At the same time he was working industriously at the literature and his <span class="italic">Jurassic System in Great Britain</span> appeared in 1933. A work of major importance and an amazing achievement for a man still in his twenties, it presented a masterly review of the principles of stratigraphy followed by a critical and exhaustive survey of information scattered in hundreds of memoirs and papers. It immediately gained for its author an international reputation, and more than sixty years later was still considered an indispensable starting point for students of the British Jurassic.<br>
<br>While continuing with stratigraphical researches in a number of areas in southern England, Arkell also took up the study of ammonites as being most usefully applicable to problems of Jurassic correlation. His <span class="italic">Monograph on the Ammonites of the English Corallian Beds</span> was published by the Palaeontographical Society between 1935 and 1948, while publication by the same society of his <span class="italic">Monograph of the English Bathonian Ammonites</span>, begun in 1951, was completed posthumously at the beginning of 1959. Shorter papers dealt with ammonites from the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays of England and with several collections from overseas. Arkell's <span class="italic">Geology of Oxford</span> was published in 1947, as was his classic geological survey memoir <span class="italic">The Geology of the Country around Weymouth, Swanage, Corfe, and Lulworth</span> (in Dorset), written during summer holidays at the family's cottage in Ringstead. He was also responsible for the sections on Jurassic ammonites in part L (1957) of the <span class="italic">Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology</span> (edited by R. C. Moore), written in conjunction with his <span class="italic">Jurassic Geology of the World</span> in 1956. The last, his second major stratigraphical work, was not only an able and critical digest of a very extensive literature, but also embodied much original information. It too became a standard work of reference throughout the world and a Russian translation was published in 1961&#151;with many additions relevant to the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>Arkell's interests were by no means confined to his Jurassic studies. For four winter seasons (1926&#150;30) he accompanied Dr K. S. Sandford on a survey of traces of Palaeolithic man in Egypt, organized by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Four notable monographs under their joint authorship (1929&#150;39) were the outcome of this work and occasional papers on palaeoliths and Pleistocene chronology appeared from Arkell's pen even later in life. Tectonic problems also attracted him, and among his papers on this subject was one on Mesozoic and Cainozoic folding in England, read at the International Geological Congress in Washington when he visited America in 1933. Topographical names and local dialects interested him considerably. Place names in Wiltshire, Dorset, and Gloucestershire formed the subject of papers in 1940&#150;42 and in 1953 he published (with S. I. Tomkeieff) a work entitled <span class="italic">English Rock Terms, Chiefly as Used by Miners and Quarrymen</span>. He was an authority on building stones and his <span class="italic">Oxford Stone</span> appeared in 1947. His writings reflect in their fluency and felicity of style a rare literary gift and, in their contents, great powers of mental concentration. An artist of no mean ability, he not only drew many of the illustrations for his various works, but painted in watercolours as a hobby.<br>
<br>Elected FRS in 1947, Arkell was awarded the Mary Clark Thompson gold medal of the National Academy of Sciences of America in 1944, the Lyell medal of the Geological Society of London in 1949, and the von Buch medal of the German Geological Society in 1953. He was also an honorary member or correspondent of several foreign learned societies.<br>
<br>Tall, robust in appearance, and fair-haired, Arkell was somewhat reserved and aloof, but was nevertheless very approachable and always ready to help younger workers. He had a strong inclination to participate in controversies (particularly in print), but bore no malice towards those with whom he disagreed. Less strong physically than he appeared, he did not recover completely from a wartime illness after work in London as a temporary civil servant (1941&#150;3), and at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge he was allotted a downstairs room to save fatigue. A stroke in 1956 left him partially paralysed and he died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge on 18 April 1958. He was survived by his wife.<br>
