<span class="headword">Howard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Matthaei]</span>,  Louise Ernestine</span>, Lady Howard  (1880&#150;1969), <span class="occ">international civil servant and advocate of organic husbandry</span>, was born on 26 December 1880 at 10 Priory Grove, Kensington, London, the youngest daughter in a family of three girls and a boy of Carl Hermann Ernst Matthaei, commission merchant, and his wife, Louise Henriette Elizabeth Sueur, musician. Of German, French, and Swiss stock, she was educated at South Hampstead high school and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where, in addition to several scholarships and prizes, she obtained firsts in both parts of the classical tripos (1903 and 1904), followed by a research fellowship. In later years she would acknowledge to Leonard and Virginia Woolf how she had been inspired at Cambridge by the teaching of the socialist and feminist Janet Case. In 1909 she became lecturer and director of studies in classics at Newnham, where she gained a reputation as a rigorous but stimulating and sympathetic teacher. In 1918 she published <span class="italic">Studies in Greek Tragedy</span>, focusing on the role of tragic accident.<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Louise Matthaei testified to her idealistic internationalism in a brief essay, <span class="italic">The Lover of the Nations</span> (1915), in which she pleaded for some attempt at a loving understanding of Germany, and for encouragement for the liberals and radicals in its universities. In a subsequent essay, &#145;Selfish states and moral individuals&#146;, published in the international suffragist periodical <span class="italic">Ius Suffragii</span> on 1 October 1915, she urged the necessity for contemporaries to purge themselves of collective paranoia. Such views did not recommend themselves to a Cambridge that &#145;had become a hospital and a camp&#146;  (E. M. Forster, <span class="italic">Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson</span>, 1934, 163). Anti-German feeling caused the half-German Louise Matthaei to leave her university post, and in 1918 she became an assistant to Leonard Woolf on his <span class="italic">International Review</span>. After publishing her pro-Spartacist study <span class="italic">Germany in Revolution</span> in 1920, she joined the agricultural section of the International Labour Organization in Geneva, having successfully sat the competitive examination. In 1924 she was promoted chief of the agricultural section and in 1935 her huge overview, <span class="italic">Labour in Agriculture, an International Survey</span>, was published by Oxford University Press. During the 1930s and 1940s she expended much energy helping German refugees from Nazism.<br>
<br>In 1931 Louise Matthaei married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56157/', "Albert Howard (1873&#150;1947)")</script>, economic botanist to the government of India, and the widower of her elder sister Gabrielle (<i>d</i>. 1930), who had also been a botanist. He was the son of Richard Howard, a Shropshire farmer, and was knighted for his services to the government of India in 1934. Like her sister before her, she devoted herself to furthering her husband's work. He was a passionate campaigner against the use of chemicals to restore fertility to the depleted soils of the world, being a doughty champion of organic methods instead. He argued that the plant should be studied together with its environment as a single unit and that mankind should respect the traditional wisdom gained from the trial and error of generations of peasants the world over. Together the Howards brought out <span class="italic">Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease</span> in 1945, and in 1947 Louise Howard published <span class="italic">The Earth's Green Carpet</span>, which foreshadowed the later ecological movement's central concerns, with its chapters on &#145;Soil fertility and human health&#146;, &#145;The wheel of life&#146;, &#145;The growth of the plant&#146;, and &#145;The retreat of the forest&#146;. Louise Howard's hope for a world without frontiers fused with her advocacy of &#145;a free exchange between the nations of the direct and indirect products of sunlight&#146; (and of a fertile soil) as the birthright of all races  (<span class="italic">Earth's Green Carpet</span>, 9). After her husband's death in 1947 she published <span class="italic">Sir Albert Howard in India</span> (1953) and co-founded the Albert Howard Foundation, which in 1953 merged with the Soil Association, of which she became honorary life vice-president.<br>
<br>To all three of her careers, as classics don, international civil servant, and advocate of organic husbandry, Louise Matthaei Howard brought wide social sympathies, a highly cultivated mind, and a large measure of dry humour. She died at her home, 14 Blackheath Park, Blackheath, London, on 11 March 1969. She had no children.<br>
