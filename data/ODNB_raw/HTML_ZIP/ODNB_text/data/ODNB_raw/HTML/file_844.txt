<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Atkinson, Sir  Harry Albert</span>  (1831&#150;1892), <span class="occ">farmer and premier of New Zealand</span>, was born on 1 November 1831 at Broxton, Cheshire, the fourth son and the seventh of the thirteen children of John Atkinson (1798&#150;1856), an architect and stonemason, and his wife, Elizabeth Smith (<i>d</i>. 1855). The family moved from place to place as his father looked for work, and they eventually settled at Frindsbury, in Kent. Harry had brief spells at school in Gravesend, Rochester, and Blackheath, but most of his eclectic education occurred at home. All the Atkinson children were encouraged to show independence from an early age; Harry bred Cochin China fowls to earn pocket money. The children were permitted by their Unitarian parents to choose their own religious denomination; Harry became an Anglican.<br>
<br>A friendship between Harry's eldest brother, John Staines Atkinson, and James Richmond, who with others of his family had already decided to go to New Zealand, introduced the Atkinsons to the idea of emigration. In time seven of the eight Atkinson siblings who lived to maturity participated in an extended kin group migration to New Zealand. Harry and his nearest brother, Arthur, who was his closest confidant throughout his life, arrived in New Plymouth, Taranaki, North Island, in 1853. Each had &pound;150 capital from their maternal grandfather. Harry purchased 100 acres about 7 miles from New Plymouth on the Carrington Road. Other family purchases rounded out the settlement, which they called Hurworth. Harry's house was built in 1854 of timber felled on the property.<br>
<br>Atkinson married (Amelia) Jane Skinner (1831&#150;1865) of Rochester in St Mary's Church, New Plymouth, on 25 March 1856. The bustling energy and growing prosperity of the settlement at Hurworth was interrupted by the war which broke out in Taranaki in 1860 between settlers and Maori. Atkinson, like most settlers, was impatient with communal Maori ownership of &#145;unused&#146; land which the settlers &#145;required&#146; for agriculture. He thought that Maori should be assimilated into European society as quickly as possible and that dispossession of their land would, in the end, lead to progress. He was an enthusiastic belligerent, serving as captain of no. 2 company of the Taranaki rifle volunteers, a settler militia.<br>
<br>Despite being elected to parliament in 1861, Atkinson was back in Taranaki in 1863 organizing an irregular force of bushrangers. He ended the war with the rank of major and was later often known as Major Atkinson. He became minister for colonial defence in the Weld ministry on 24 November 1864, but retired on 16 October 1865. His wife, who with their children had been evacuated to Wanganui, died (of suffocation by goitre) on 22 June 1865, leaving Atkinson with three young sons and a daughter. On 13 June 1866 he married his cousin, Annie Smith (1838&#150;1919), at St Mary's Church, New Plymouth; two sons and two daughters were born of this second marriage.<br>
<br>Atkinson always considered himself primarily a farmer. Hurworth and the concerns of the Taranaki settler community, especially bush farmers breaking in forest land for agriculture, were never far from his mind. Yet he found himself irresistibly drawn to politics, even though he was a man of modest means and the rewards of political life were slim. He said in 1857, when he was elected to the Taranaki provincial council, that he went &#145;to speak for the bush&#146;; and he saw his role in central politics as being a farmers' advocate. On 3 October 1872 Atkinson was elected to parliament as member for Egmont, a constituency he held until 22 January 1891. On 7 September 1874 he joined Julius Vogel's cabinet as minister for crown lands and immigration, and he became premier when Vogel went to London as agent-general. In all he was premier four times: 1 September 1876 &#150; 13 October 1877; 25 September 1883 &#150; 16 August 1884; 28 August 1884 &#150; 3 September 1884; and 8 October 1887 &#150; 24 January 1891. He was colonial treasurer for ten years between 1876 and 1891, but it was the misfortune of one so enthusiastic about progress that these were mostly depression years. Atkinson's optimism was always tempered by prudence and economy. The voters in theory agreed, but in practice revolted when more promising policies were offered.<br>
<br>As Atkinson grew older, his interests widened. He was accused by his conservative colleagues of harbouring fads, but he was indifferent to their criticisms. He supported proportional representation, women's suffrage, and perpetual leasehold land tenure to help small farmers on to land and preserve a &#145;land endowment&#146; for future generations. All these reforms, he felt, were conducive to individual independence and responsibility. He also favoured temperance, Anglo-Saxon federation, and income taxes. He voted for one man, one vote in 1889. Above all, he advocated national insurance&#151;compulsory saving while young and employed to provide for the catastrophes of colonial life: unemployment, becoming an orphan, sickness, and old age. When he propounded his scheme in 1882 and 1883 it was denounced as &#145;an attempt to make every single individual a part of a great communistic society&#146;  (Sir George Grey, 10 July 1882, <span class="italic">New Zealand Parliamentary Debates</span>, 42.194).<br>
<br>In January 1888 Atkinson was created KCMG and in January 1891, after electoral defeat, he became speaker of the legislative council. He died of heart failure in his room in Parliament House, Wellington, on 28 June 1892, and was buried the following month in Karori cemetery, Wellington. Throughout his long career he identified passionately with new farmers, and as &#145;the Major&#146; he retained the glamour of the &#145;settler armed&#146;. Yet he never spoke of the wars and was too pragmatic and too receptive to new ideas to be classified as a rural conservative. Although he became a professional politician, Atkinson was no crowd-pleaser. He was didactic on the hustings and ebulliently pugnacious in the house, always in pursuit of his own, moderate line. After 1889 he was left behind by the party alignments forming around him and became a figure of nostalgia, &#145;the most perfect type of an old settler&#146;  (James Allen, 29 June 1892, <span class="italic">New Zealand Parliamentary Debates</span>, 75.65).<br>
