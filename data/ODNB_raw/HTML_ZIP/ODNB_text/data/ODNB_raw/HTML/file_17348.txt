<span class="headword">Macaulay,  Kenneth</span>  (1723/4&#150;1779), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and local historian</span>, was the third son of Aulay Macaulay (<i>d</i>. 1758), minister of Harris, and Margaret Morrison (<i>d</i>. 1771), daughter of Kenneth Morrison, minister of Stornoway, Isle of Lewis. He was educated at King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated MA on 1 April 1742. On 15 November 1749 he was appointed missionary to Lochaber, but declined the post. On 20 November 1751 he was ordained as assistant and successor to his father, on whose death in 1758 he became sole pastor. On 4 August of the same year he married Penelope Macleod (<i>d</i>. 1799); the eldest of their five children, Neil, later became a missionary minister in Harris. Macaulay was presented by Archibald, third duke of Argyll, to the parish of Ardnamurchan, Argyll, and was admitted there on 15 July 1761. On 17 November 1772 he was translated to Cawdor in the presbytery of Nairn.<br>
<br>In 1758 Macaulay visited St Kilda on behalf of the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), and in 1764 he published in London as his own composition <span class="italic">The history of St Kilda, containing a description of this remarkable island, the manners and customs of its inhabitants, the religious and pagan antiquities there found; with many other interesting particulars</span>. James Boswell showed the book to Samuel Johnson before their visit to the Hebrides in 1773, and Johnson pronounced it &#145;very well written, except for some foppery about liberty and slavery&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 2.150). The two travellers visited Macaulay on their journey to the Hebrides and from conversation with him came to the conclusion that he could not have written the book. &#145;There is&#146;, Johnson said, &#145;a combination in it of which Macaulay is not capable&#146;  (ibid., 5.119). Johnson may have been influenced in his opinion by a discussion he had on the English clergy with Macaulay, who was by no means respectful towards episcopal claims. Johnson pronounced him a &#145;bigot to laxness&#146;  (ibid., 5.120). Boswell was told that the book had been written by John Macpherson of Skye from materials supplied by Macaulay, but it is now generally accepted that the bulk of the book is Macaulay's own work, with some contributions from Macpherson. Macaulay died at the age of fifty-five on 2 March 1779 and was survived by his wife, who died on 7 May 1799.<br>
