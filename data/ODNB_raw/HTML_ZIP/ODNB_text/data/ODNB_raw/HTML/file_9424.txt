<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Filmer, Sir  Robert</span>  (1588?&#150;1653), <span class="occ">political writer</span>, was born in East Sutton, Kent, almost certainly in 1588, the eldest of the eighteen children of Sir Edward Filmer (1566&#150;1629), a country gentleman, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1570&#150;1638), daughter of Richard Argall (or Argol). Edward and Elizabeth Filmer had married in 1585. Little is known for certain of Filmer's early education, though he appears to have been sent to the grammar school at Canterbury. He was subsequently educated at Trinity College, Cambridge (he matriculated at Easter 1604). He did not take a degree, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 24 January 1605. He was called to the bar in 1613, but there is no record of his ever practising law. Filmer's early life seems to have been spent mostly in Westminster, and he eventually acquired as his town house the porter's lodge of Westminster Abbey, which remained his until his death.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandthecivilwars"></a>Marriage and the civil wars</h2>Filmer married Anne Heton 
    (or Hetton; <i>d</i>. 1671)
   in St Leonard's Church, London, on 8 August 1618. Anne was the daughter and coheir (with her sister) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13138/', "Martin Heton (1554&#150;1609)")</script>, bishop of Ely from 1599 until his death. There has been speculation about whether Filmer married a child bride, and certainly a marriage licence was issued (the usual way to avoid reading of the banns), but in any case the first child of the marriage was baptized in February 1620. Soon after his marriage Filmer was knighted by King James I at Newmarket on 24 January 1619.<br>
<br>When his father died on 2 November 1629, Sir Robert's centre of activities shifted from Westminster to the estates and manor house that he inherited at East Sutton. His father, Edward Filmer, had shown a considerable record of activity in the affairs of Kent, and was eventually knighted. He had served as sheriff of Kent in 1616. Edward Filmer had inherited the manor of Little Charlton in East Sutton, Kent, from his own father, Robert, and had later purchased the manor of East Sutton itself from his brother-in-law, John Argall. Sir Robert inherited these and other lands, and followed his father's lead by involving himself in the politics of the county. He served as a justice of the peace and an officer of the county militia in the 1630s, though when the county began to divide early in 1642, it was not Sir Robert but his eldest son, Sir Edward Filmer, who was active in the newly emergent opposition to the excesses of the Long Parliament. Nevertheless, in April 1642 Filmer stood surety for &pound;5000 to secure the release from custody of his friend Sir Roger Twysden, when the latter was imprisoned by the Commons for his involvement with the Kentish petition of 25 March 1642. Parliamentary troops looted Filmer's East Sutton manor at the beginning of September 1642, and by 1643 Filmer's properties in Westminster and Kent were being heavily taxed in the interests of the parliamentary cause. Throughout 1643 he was repeatedly harassed on suspicion of supporting the king, but Filmer does not, in fact, seem to have been active in lending such support. No hard evidence against him was ever uncovered by the county committee. Indeed he was soon to assert his neutrality, and he invited his persecutors to note &#145;how far he hath binn from medling on either side in deeds or so much as words&#146;  (Laslett, &#145;Sir Robert Filmer&#146;, 535). In spite of this, one of Filmer's own tenants did inform the county committee&#151;falsely it seems&#151;that he had hidden arms for the royalist cause in the parish church. Perhaps as a consequence of this, Filmer was imprisoned for a time in Leeds Castle, and his estates were sequestered. It is uncertain exactly how long he spent in confinement, but it was at least from early 1643 until the summer of 1645. On 26 May 1648 Filmer's support was sought by eight of his fellow Kentish gentlemen for the Kentish revolt (May&#150;June 1648) that formed part of the second civil war. Though he was assured that no one expected him to take an active part in military affairs, Filmer appears to have declined his assistance, perhaps claiming that his increasingly fragile health prevented him from doing much. By this time, though, his words had become a good deal stronger than his deeds, and Sir Robert's pen had produced two of a series of political tracts in support of the king's authority.<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>Filmer was the friend of a number of distinguished historians and scholars. One circle formed around his Westminster existence, and included the antiquarian scholars William Camden and Sir Henry Spelman, and the Laudian divine Peter Heylyn (from 1631 a prebendary of Westminster Abbey, and thus almost literally on Filmer's doorstep). From 1629 Filmer entered a circle of scholarly Kentish gentlemen which also included Sir Edward Dering and Filmer's close friend Sir Roger Twysden. It has been suggested that Filmer's earliest writings may well have been written for circulation in manuscript among this circle. There may be truth in this, but it is also true that Filmer's intellectual interests owed at least as much to his Westminster and London friends, and that he did in fact seek early publication for his work. Around 1630 he wrote two important works which were only published much later. <span class="italic">Quaestio quodlibetica, or, A Discourse whether it may be Lawful to Take Use for Money</span> was said by Sir Roger Twysden, the man responsible for its first publication (dated 1653, though the work was available before the end of 1652), to have been written &#145;almost thirty yeares since&#146;, suggesting a date for its composition in the later 1620s  (sig. a2<i>r</i>). It defends the paying of interest on money borrowed as compatible with biblical instruction. Filmer's best-known work, <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, was perhaps written a little later, about 1630, though it remained unpublished until 1680. There has been much dispute over when <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span> was composed, but there is good internal evidence to suggest that the manuscript of the work now in the University of Chicago Library Codex MS 413 was composed before 1631. The idea that Filmer was unwilling to publish at this time of his life, and that he wrote only for a restricted audience, has been reinforced by a letter from Peter Heylyn to Filmer's son Sir Edward Filmer, of 20 April 1659, later printed as a preface to the 1680 editions of <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>. Heylyn remarked that Filmer &#145;did not think it fit while he was alive, to gratifie the Nation in publishing that excellent Piece&#146;  (Heylyn, 208). So far as <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span> was concerned this was not true. In 1632 Filmer sought permission to publish what was almost certainly a version of <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>. The request came before Georg Rudolph Weckherlin, who handled much licensing work of this sort, and Weckherlin referred it to the king himself. Charles refused permission to publish.<br>
<br>Filmer's first published work was probably <span class="italic">Of the Blasphemie Against the Holy Ghost</span>, which appeared in February 1646. The pamphlet was reprinted in 1677 as <span class="italic">A Tract Concerning the Sin Against the Holy Ghost</span> as the work of John Hales, and it has been commonly attributed to Hales ever since. Manuscript evidence seems, however, to confirm Filmer's authorship. The work was an exercise in defining the <i>via media</i>, criticizing the views both of the schoolmen and of some reformed divines, notably Calvin, on the subject. The anti-Calvinism of the work perhaps reflects Filmer's known connections to the world of high-churchmanship: he was not only a friend of Heylyn's but also the dedicatee of Ambrose Fisher's <span class="italic">A Defence of the Liturgie of the Church of England</span> (1630).<br>
<br>Filmer's first published political work has also raised similar concerns of authorship. <span class="italic">The Freeholder's Grand Inquest, Touching our Soveraigne Lord the King and his Parliament</span> was published early in 1648. From 1679 it several times lent its title to collections of Filmer's political writings. Despite this, the work was attributed by Anthony Wood to Sir Robert Holbourne (or Holborne), and a number of scholars maintain that attribution, though most accept the work as Filmer's. If this tract was Filmer's, it was the first of a sequence of five published political works that ran from 1648 to 1652. All of them appear to have been published by the royalist printer Richard Royston.<h2>
<a name="Patriarcha"></a>Patriarcha</h2>
<span class="italic">The Freeholder's Grand Inquest</span> can be read as an elaboration of the third and final section of <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, in which Filmer had applied his more general arguments to the English constitution and English law. In general, all of Filmer's political writings built on the foundation laid by <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>. That book was a clearly organized and succinct work. It did three main things. First, it refuted all accounts of human society that suggested that the people were originally free, and that political authority originated in the consent of these free people. Filmer, displaying considerable acumen and powers of logic, was able to pick some sizeable holes in consent theory, and it is in this area that the book still has some force. Secondly, as an alternative account of the matter, Filmer identified political authority with the patriarchal authority of Adam. No human beings were ever born into freedom, because from creation onwards royal-patriarchal authority was in the hands of successors to the patriarchal authority of Adam, and then again of Noah. All modern kings were &#145;either fathers of their people, or heirs of such fathers or usurpers of the right of such fathers&#146;  (Sommerville, 2). Kings might be elected by their people, but the power that they executed was divinely instituted at the creation. Thirdly, Filmer used these arguments as a basis for a reading of the English constitution and its development. The natural patriarchal authority of kings was not limited by positive law. The king of England was &#145;the author, interpreter and corrector of the common laws&#146;  (Sommerville, 34). The liberties of parliament existed only by the monarch's grace, and, in point of fact, the Commons were not an original part of parliament. Many of Filmer's contemporaries believed that the tripartite character of the modern parliament had existed from before the Norman conquest, but he argued that the Commons had been summoned only from the time of Henry I. This proved, so Filmer argued, that the people had no natural or original right to parliamentary representation.<br>
<br>The political works that Filmer published in his own lifetime developed points made in <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>. <span class="italic">The Freeholder's Grand Inquest</span> was a royalist survey of the history of English law and constitution. <span class="italic">The Anarchy of a Limited or Mixed Monarchy</span>, which appeared in April 1648, was a Bodinian reply to Philip Hunton and others, arguing that stable &#145;mixed&#146; government was impossible. There must be a single arbitrary authority in any stable political community. Filmer's reliance on Bodin was taken further in his <span class="italic">The Necessity of the Absolute Power of All Kings</span> (August 1648), which consisted entirely of a digest of passages from Richard Knolles's 1606 translation of Bodin's <span class="italic">Les six livres de la r&eacute;publique</span>. This flurry of publication in 1648 was followed by silence, until February 1652 saw the appearance of <span class="italic">Observations Concerning the Original of Government</span>. This work, in replies to Grotius, Milton, and Hobbes, carried further Filmer's attack on consent theory, and like its successor <span class="italic">Observations upon Aristotle's Politiques Touching Forms of Government</span> (May 1652) was perhaps a shade more reflective than the engaged works of 1648. The <span class="italic">Observations</span> was, though, coupled with Filmer's more obviously topical <span class="italic">Directions for Obedience to Governours in Dangerous and Doubtfull Times</span>, in which he seemed to accept that in fact many, and perhaps all, governments originated in usurpation, and in which he tentatively allowed that usurpers might be obeyed in matters indifferent.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>Filmer remained intellectually active until the end of his life. Though May 1652 saw his last political work, he was not quite finished with publishing. In late July 1652 the Kent summer assizes convicted ten people of witchcraft, at least six of whom were hanged. The event prompted Filmer's last known work, <span class="italic">An Advertisement to the Jury-Men of England, Touching Witches</span>, published in March 1653. The witches hanged were accused of causing death by witchcraft, and confessed &#145;that the Divell had known them carnally, and that they had no hurt by it&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Prodigious and Tragicall History</span>, 3). Filmer's scepticism was aroused, and he wrote a tract arguing that none of the &#145;marks&#146; of witchcraft identified by the puritan clergyman William Perkins provided a reliable guide to whether someone really was a witch, and that the scriptures provided little foundation for the view that witchcraft involved a diabolic pact.<br>
<br>Sir Robert Filmer died on or around 23 May 1653, and was buried in East Sutton on 30 May. His will, dated 1 November 1651, was proved on 13 January 1654. Filmer was survived by his wife and three sons (Edward, Robert, and Samuel) and by a daughter (Anne). Two other children, Elizabeth and Thomas, had predeceased their father. There are contemporary portraits of both Sir Robert and his wife Lady Anne which remain in private ownership. Filmer also left behind a number of unpublished works. They included, in addition to <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, a treatise &#145;in praise of the virtuous wife&#146;, published by Margaret Ezell in 1987, and a substantial treatise entitled &#145;Theology or divinity&#146;. A tract of about 1649 by a royalist casuist concerning the lawfulness of taking the Engagement oath, though in Filmer's hand and sometimes attributed to him, is almost certainly by another, perhaps Sir John Monson.<br>
<br>Death did not end Filmer's contribution to English political life. Though his writings were little noticed by his own contemporaries they were to stimulate extensive debate when republished after 1679. Filmer's reputation has been much shaped by these debates, in which he was a posthumous participant. In the turbulent years after 1678, the supporters of Charles II drew upon Filmer's writings in their efforts to rebut arguments for the exclusion of the king's brother James, duke of York, from the succession, and for the limitation of the monarchy. As a result, he is now remembered almost entirely for his political writings, and in particular for their notoriety as the target of Locke's first <span class="italic">Treatise</span>. In the 1640s and 1650s Filmer's views were rejected by the Presbyterian writers Clement Walker and Edward Gee; but also by his Kentish friend Sir Roger Twysden. But it was the republication of his works in 1679, and then the publication of <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span> in 1680, that made Filmer the target of whig writers, notably (in addition to Locke) James Tyrell and Algernon Sidney. Concern about Filmer's view of the English constitution as the creation of a sovereign king inspired a reply from William Petyt which, in its turn, inspired a defence of the Filmerian position from Robert Brady. In 1684 Edmund Bohun produced a defence of Filmer's views, and in the following year there appeared a third and more careful edition of <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, based on a manuscript available to Archbishop William Sancroft.<br>
<br>Despite Bohun's efforts, the whigs, and Locke in particular, treated Filmer as a figure of ridicule for a long time. On the other hand, Filmer's adherence to Spelman's view that the House of Commons was no older than the thirteenth century was to prove, in Brady's hands, a powerful weapon against the whigs. More broadly, it helped to create a climate in which the idea of the pristine Saxon constitution, embodying king, lords, and commons, could be exposed as myth. More recently there has been a sustained reappraisal of Filmer's work, made possible especially by Peter Laslett's 1949 edition of his political writings. All Filmer's writing may be understood as attempting to apply the scriptures to contemporary problems&#151;usury, theological dispute, politics, witchcraft&#151;but the application was undertaken with intelligence. He was a succinct writer in a prolix age, and a man with a keen eye for the weak points in his opponents' arguments. Unfortunately for him, they had as good an eye for the weak points in his, and historical circumstance helped to give them a more attentive audience.<br>
