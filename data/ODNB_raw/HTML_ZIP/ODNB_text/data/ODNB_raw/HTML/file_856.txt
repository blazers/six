<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Thomas</span>  (1599&#150;1639), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in London in August 1599; he may have been the Thomas, son of Steven Atkynson, baptized on 2 September 1599 at All Hallows, Bread Street. He entered the Merchant Taylors' School in August 1608. Twice a finalist for a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, he lost the election in 1614 when William Laud was one of the examiners, but won it in the following year. He matriculated at Oxford on 13 October 1615, and is described in the register as the sixteen-year-old son of a London gentleman. Atkinson was admitted BA on 12 May 1619, but did not complete the requirements for that degree until the following year. He proceeded MA on 26 April 1623. On 12 February 1625 he was ordained deacon by Laud. He was named senior proctor of the university on 15 April 1629 and graduated BD on 12 May 1630.<br>
<br>Twenty-three of Atkinson's letters to Sir Hugh Smyth and his son Thomas have survived in the Bristol Record Office. The correspondence begins in 1623 and documents Atkinson's role as the tutor and guardian of Smyth's son at Oxford. It ends in 1636 with Atkinson begging Thomas for money to repay a debt to the college president. On 29 August 1636 the king, the queen, and their two nephews visited Laud at Oxford: they were escorted to St John's College, where Atkinson delivered a speech in their honour. According to Laud, the speech was &#145;very brief, and much approved of by his majesty afterwards to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of &hellip; William Laud</span>, 5.149). On 20 January 1638 Atkinson was installed as rector of South Warnborough, Hampshire, but apparently he was not content with this living. Laud gave his permission on 9 November 1638 for Atkinson to exchange livings with Peter Heylin, then rector of Islip, Oxfordshire. Atkinson died in early February 1639 and was buried in the chapel of St John's College on 6 February. The administration of his effects was granted at Oxford on 21 February 1640.<br>
<br>Atkinson left a Latin play, <span class="italic">Homo</span>, in manuscript at his death; it takes up the entire volume (thirteen folios, including two of preliminary matter) of Harley MS 6925 in the British Library. Possibly a response to a standard college exercise, the play is an allegory in iambic senarius about Epimetheus's struggle with Prometheus for the loyalty of man, resulting in man's loss of eternal youth. It is dedicated to William Laud as president of St John's College. Thus Bentley assigns it to the period between Atkinson's matriculation at St John's in 1615 and Laud's resignation as college president in late 1621. Anthony Wood mentions two additional manuscript works by Atkinson: &#145;Andrei Melvini &#147;Anti-tami-cunicategoria&#148;&#146;, written in sapphics, and &#145;Melvinus delirans&#146;, written in iambics. Bentley states that a copy of the former work can be found in &#145;Folger MS 2203.1&#146;, and his statement has been repeated by several writers, but the relevant manuscript is actually a copy of Andrew Melville's &#145;Anti-tami-cami-categoria&#146; (<i>c</i>.1604), not printed until 1620. Atkinson's &#145;Melvinus delirans, sive, Satyra edentula contra eiusdem &#147;Anti-tami-cami-categoriam&#148;&#146;, also dedicated to Laud, is in the British Library (Harley MS 3496, fols. 79&#150;89). Also in the British Library is a theme by Atkinson on the thesis &#145;Vivitur parvo ben&eacute;&#146; (Add. MS 21508, fols. 8&#150;9).<br>
