<span class="headword">Watson, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1796&#150;1860), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was born at Nottingham on 1 July 1796, son of John Watson, captain in the 76th foot, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Grey of Bamburgh, Northumberland. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Marlow, commissioned as cornet in the 1st (Royal) Dragoons by the duke of York on 14 November 1811, and promoted lieutenant on 7 May 1812 while serving in the Spanish peninsula. The 1st dragoons were reduced in 1814, and in April 1815 Watson exchanged into the 6th (Inniskilling) dragoons. He served with the regiment in Belgium and France, sharing in the Waterloo prize money in the process, and being present at the entry of the allied armies into Paris.<br>
<br>Placed on half pay on 25 March 1816, Watson entered Lincoln's Inn as a student on 19 June 1817. By hard work he soon became competent to practise as a special pleader, and continued to do so until 1832, when he was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn. He joined the northern circuit, where he found work and became popular, taking silk and becoming a bencher of his inn in 1843. His advocacy was honest and earnest rather than eloquent, but he was a sound lawyer and author of two (for a time) standard professional works, one on arbitration and award (1825; 3rd edn, 1846), and the other on the office of sheriff (1827; 2nd edn, 1848, by William Newland Welsby).<br>
<br>On 17 August 1826 Watson married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1828), only daughter of William Armstrong of Newcastle upon Tyne, and sister of Lord Armstrong. After Anne's death he married Mary, daughter of Anthony Capron (later Hollist) of Midhurst, Sussex, in August 1831. Each marriage produced one son.<br>
<br>Watson entered the House of Commons in 1841 as Liberal member for Kinsale, retaining his seat until 1847. His Liberal candidacy for Newcastle upon Tyne in July 1852 was unsuccessful, but in 1854 he was elected member for Hull, and sat as such until his appointment to the exchequer bench on 5 November 1856 in succession to Sir Thomas Platt. Watson was knighted on 28 November 1856. He had a clear head and a strong mind, but his judicial career was cut short when at the conclusion of his charge to the grand jury at Welshpool on 12 March 1860 he was seized with apoplexy. He died the next day, and was buried at the new church in Welshpool.<br>
