<span class="headword">Baker,  Herbert Brereton</span>  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at Livesey, near Blackburn, on 25 June 1862, the second son of John Baker, curate in charge of Livesey, afterwards vicar of St John's Church, Blackburn, and his wife, Caroline Slater. Ill health kept him indoors; he could read before he was four years old and at ten he had read most of his father's library. He was educated first at Blackburn grammar school and then at Manchester grammar school, where, changing from the classical to the science side, he came under the influence of Francis Jones, often referred to by him as &#145;the best of all teachers&#146;. A Brackenbury scholarship at Balliol College and a school Brackenbury award enabled Baker to go to Oxford where, with Harold Baily Dixon as his tutor, he in 1883 obtained a first class in natural science. From 1883 to 1885 he was demonstrator in chemistry at Balliol and private assistant to Dixon, who communicated to Baker his own enthusiasm for investigation and led him into that field of research to which later he contributed so notably&#151;the influence of moisture on chemical change.<br>
<br>In 1886 Baker went as chemistry master and head of the science side to Dulwich College. Here he built up a most successful science side; the excellence of his teaching and his own interest in research were an inspiration to many of his pupils. During his time at Dulwich, Baker attained an eminence rare for a schoolmaster; some of his most remarkable results were obtained while he was there, and he was elected FRS in 1902. In the same year he was appointed headmaster of Alleyn's School, Dulwich, but in 1904 he returned to Oxford as Lee's reader in chemistry at Christ Church, of which he was elected a student and tutor. Here he was responsible for the teaching of inorganic chemistry in the university and his experimentally illustrated lectures were highly popular. On 21 March 1905 he married Muriel (<i>b</i>. 1875/6), only child of Harry James Powell, partner in the Whitefriars glassworks. She too was a trained chemist and collaborated with her husband in a number of his researches. They had one son, who predeceased his father, and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1912 Baker accepted the chief professorship of chemistry at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, South Kensington, in succession to Sir T. E. Thorpe; he held this post until his retirement in 1932. In April 1915 he was called upon by the rector of the Imperial College, Sir Alfred Keogh, then director of medical services at the War Office, to advise on the steps to be taken against German gas attacks. For his valuable services in this and other scientific duties undertaken for the war departments he was appointed CBE in 1917.<br>
<br>Baker's claim to fame rests on his achievements as an experimentalist rather than as a theoretical chemist. A competent glass-worker, his exceptional skill in the preparation and manipulation of intensively dried substances enabled him to achieve results which others, with less mastery of the technique, were sometimes at first unable to repeat. Perhaps his most outstanding achievements in this field were the demonstration that dried ammonium chloride does not dissociate when volatilized by heat; that hydrogen and oxygen prepared by the electrolysis of pure barium hydroxide do not combine on heating when carefully dried; and that while very dry nitrogen trioxide does not break up on vaporization, the slightest trace of moisture causes the gas to dissociate completely into nitric oxide and nitrogen peroxide. He demonstrated the slowing down or complete stoppage of chemical action in numerous other instances and his remarkable success in demonstrating this effect led chemists to refer to the relative dryness of things as dry, very dry, or &#145;Baker dry&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1923 Baker was awarded the Davy medal of the Royal Society, and in 1912 the Longstaff medal of the Chemical Society, of which he was elected president in 1926. In 1926 the University of Aberdeen conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD. Active in the laboratory until his final days, Baker died at his home, Latchmoor House, Gerrards Cross, on 27 April 1935. His wife survived him.<br>
