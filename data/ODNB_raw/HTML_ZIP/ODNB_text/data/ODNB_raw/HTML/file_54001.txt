<span class="headword">Hayward,  Walter Scott</span>  (1855&#150;1910), <span class="occ">yachtsman and boat designer</span>, was born on 17 April 1855 at 20 St James Walk, Clerkenwell, London, the son of James Robertson Hayward (<i>d</i>. in or before 1880), ironmonger, and his wife, Eliza Isabella Greely. Nothing is known about his education or early life, but he joined Royal Temple Yacht Club, London, in 1871, sailing at various south coast venues before moving to Manchester in 1877 and joining Cheshire and New Brighton sailing clubs. In 1879 Hayward became one of the very few amateur yachtsmen who passed the Board of Trade's professional examination for yacht masters before the First World War. In Southport on 2 August 1880 he married Louise Eleanor, daughter of John Robson Ivy, a Southport silk merchant; they had one daughter and at least five sons, including the writer and actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74820/', "(Harold) Richard Hayward")</script>. On the marriage certificate Hayward's occupation is given as manufacturer. Three years later, in 1883 he was elected to membership of the prestigious Royal Mersey Yacht Club as a &#145;merchant&#146;.<br>
<br>It is probable that by the 1880s Hayward's business interests were in the marine area, and by then he had emerged as the leading small yacht racer in the north west. Although British yacht clubs remained solidly middle-class, Hayward believed that they should widen their membership by reducing the cost of sailing and recruiting far more actively among younger employees in the growing urban professions who, with improved rail networks, could now afford weekend travel to coastal venues. With this in mind, he successfully founded the West Lancashire Yacht Club (WLYC) in 1894 and also established his reputation as a yacht designer. Hayward's contribution became particularly significant in the 1890s because British sailing was then dominated by the conservatively minded Yacht Racing Association (YRA) which supported an elaborate system of rating formulae for all racing boat designs. Its approach inadvertently encouraged wealthy owners to spend heavily, often with scant regard for safety, on new yachts which exploited loopholes in the ratings. The YRA's committee of like-minded yachtsmen could only respond ineffectively with further rules aimed at stopping what was barely distinguishable from cheating.<br>
<br>By contrast, Hayward advocated using small &#145;one-design&#146; yachts regulated by independent local class associations, with very strict rules giving the wealthy no room for manoeuvre. Indeed, Hayward took a lead of national significance in 1898, when he co-operated with Manchester electrical engineer Herbert Baggs to design the &#145;Seabird&#146; yacht for the WLYC. The yachting press immediately praised its excellent seaworthiness and extremely low on-the-water price limit of &pound;35, which certainly encouraged wider middle-class participation, with the Seabird being rapidly adopted by other clubs in the north west, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Hayward never patented the design, and so did not receive any royalties for what became a very popular boat. He later founded the Seabird Association in 1906, which ultimately enabled the Seabird to become one of the oldest surviving one-design classes in the world.<br>
<br>In the late 1890s Hayward settled near Belfast, where his daughter Gladys, having been taught to sail by her father, became one of the few British women to gain national recognition as competitive helms before 1914. Hayward was a unionist and member of the Church of Ireland, attending Jordanstown church. His restless energy reveals a sociable man who never single-mindedly pursued yachting. He rode with the New Ross harriers and foxhounds, perhaps recalling earlier robust sporting triumphs like his victory in the British amateur single stick championship. Another of his ventures attracted publicity in 1896 when he designed the largest motor yacht to have been launched on the Mersey. From 1906 he followed this up by turning to motor boat racing and establishing Messrs W. Hayward &amp; Co., marine motor engineers, in Belfast, while the congested districts board of Ireland commissioned him to develop the use of motorized fishing boats along the west coast.<br>
<br>In 1910 Hayward travelled to Vladivostok on the Trans-Siberian Railway to advise Russian fishermen about the use of motor boats. He planned to continue to Hong Kong, where two of his sons were opening a car dealership, and then to visit San Francisco on his way home. But he fell ill before arriving at Hong Kong and was admitted to the Peak Hospital. Only partially recovered, he left for England via Suez with one of his sons on the SS <i>Pembrokeshire</i>. He died from tubercular disease of the left lung on 15 August 1910 as the ship passed through the Red Sea and he was buried at sea the next day.<br>
