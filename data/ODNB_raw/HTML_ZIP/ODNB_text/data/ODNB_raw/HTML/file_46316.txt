<span class="headword">Bedingfield <span class="st"> [Bedingfeld]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1476&#150;1760), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, originated from the parish of that name in Suffolk, where a branch of the family continued to reside into the seventeenth century. Their move to Norfolk resulted from the marriage of Margaret Tuddenham (<i>d</i>. 1476) to Edmund Bedingfield of Bedingfield (<i>d</i>. 1451); she inherited her brother Thomas's estate, which comprised twenty-three manors in Norfolk and Suffolk, following his execution in 1462. On Margaret's death in 1476 the estate, which included the Norfolk manor of Oxburgh, passed to her grandson <a name="cosubject_76391"></a><span class="headword">Edmund Bedingfield</span>  (1443&#150;1496)<span class="occ"></span>, who was the son of Thomas Bedingfield (<i>d</i>. 1453) and Anne Waldegrave (<i>d</i>. 1453). It was Edmund who decided to move the family's main residence to Oxburgh, erecting a fine brick-built moated house there about 1482. Oxburgh thereafter became the home of the main branch of the family with cadet branches residing at Quidenham in Norfolk, Redlingfield and Bedingfield in Suffolk, and elsewhere. Edmund, a Yorkist supporter, was knighted by Richard III about 1483, but the family soon accommodated itself to the Tudor regime, entertaining Henry VII and the court at Oxburgh in 1487. Sir Edmund was married twice, first to Alice Shelton and then to Margaret Scot (<i>d</i>. 1514).<br>
<br>On Edmund's death at Oxburgh in 1496, his eldest son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1539), succeeded to the estate. Thomas was knighted at the coronation of Henry VIII, but it was Edmund and Margaret's youngest son and eventual heir, <a name="cosubject_76392"></a><span class="headword">Sir Edmund Bedingfield</span>  (1479/80&#150;1553)<span class="occ"></span>, who served the dynasty most successfully, being knighted for his bravery in the French wars by Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, in 1523. He was later entrusted with the custody of Katherine of Aragon at Kimbolton Castle in Huntingdonshire after the royal divorce and was responsible for the arrangements for her funeral procession from there to Peterborough in 1536. In 1539, aged fifty-nine, he inherited Oxburgh from his brother Robert. He married Grace Marney (<i>d</i>. in or after 1553), the daughter of Henry, first Baron Marney, and had died by June 1553, when he was succeeded by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1936/', "Sir Henry Bedingfeld (1509x11&#150;1583)")</script>. Henry was a privy councillor to Mary Tudor but remained a staunch Roman Catholic under Elizabeth, which led to the family's withdrawal from active participation in national and county politics by the time of his death. His recusancy occasionally brought him into conflict with diocesan authorities, and members of the family (especially his son John) were often cited before the courts; however, the relative isolation of their main estates around Oxburgh and their detachment from more politically active forms of Catholicism afforded some protection to the family. Henry was succeeded in turn by his son Edmund (<i>d</i>. 1585) and grandson Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1590).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_76393"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Bedingfield</span>  (1581/2&#150;1657)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Thomas Bedingfield and Frances Jernegan, was still a child at his father's death and the ensuing minority compounded the effect of the family's recusancy, increasing its financial difficulties and further excluding its members from engagement in local politics. By this time the family had withdrawn socially into the recusant community, forging marriage alliances with such other well-known East Anglian Catholic families as the Southwells and the Jerninghams. In 1604 Henry, then aged twenty-two, reinforced the alliance by marrying Mary (<i>d</i>. by 1611), daughter of Lord William Howard of Naworth (Cumberland) and granddaughter of the duke of Norfolk, who had been executed for treason in 1572. Like many other Roman Catholic gentry, Henry was a loyal supporter of Charles I and was restored to the county bench in the 1620s. During the civil wars he raised troops for the king and three of his sons took up arms; one of them, John, was killed at the battle of Worcester. Henry was knighted for his services to the crown about 1645, but after the defeat of Charles he was imprisoned in the Tower from 1647 to 1649. There he composed a meditation on the passion which he dedicated to his second wife, Elizabeth Hoghton (<i>d</i>. 1662), of the well-known Lancashire Catholic family, whom he had married in 1611. As an active royalist Henry's estates were sequestered by parliament in 1652 and the house suffered extensive damage from fire at this time. He was succeeded at his death on 22 November 1657 by his eldest son Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1665), who had been a colonel in the royalist army and was wounded during the siege of Lincoln, and on Thomas's death by Henry's second son, <a name="cosubject_76394"></a><span class="headword">Sir Henry Bedingfield</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685)<span class="occ"></span>, who had been living abroad with the royal court since the end of the civil wars. Another son, Edmund, had been educated abroad at St Omer and was ordained priest at Seville about 1644; he later returned to Flanders as chaplain to the Carmelite nuns at Antwerp, where two of his cousins had been sisters, and he moved with that community to its new home at Lierre in Brabant in 1648, remaining there as a canon of the cathedral until his death on 2 September 1680. During the 1650s two other cousins of the Suffolk branch of the family resident at Bedingfield were also working in Flanders as Jesuit priests, one of them, Henry (<i>d</i>. 1659), as provincial of the order there.<br>
<br>At the restoration of Charles II the royalist Henry Bedingfield returned to England but not to Oxburgh, where the damage done to the house and the losses incurred on the estate during the wars, estimated by him at more than &pound;45,000, proved too daunting. In recognition of his service to the Stuarts he was made a baronet by Charles II in 1661, but no financial recompense was forthcoming. Henry made safe the buildings at Oxburgh when he finally regained possession of it and the family's other Norfolk properties in 1665, but chose to reside at Beck Hall near Billingford from 1660 until his death on 24 February 1685. He retained the family's strong attachment to Roman Catholicism, having married a member of another Norfolk recusant family, Margaret Paston (<i>d</i>. 1703) of Appleton, in 1634. Two of their daughters joined the Carmelite nuns at Lierre, where their uncle Edmund was chaplain; another, Frances, married Richard Caryll of West Grinstead, the younger son of a recusant family which produced many priests and religious figures during the eighteenth century; and a fourth, Mary, married Thomas Eyre of Hassop in Derbyshire, with whom she had ten children, two sons entering the priesthood and two daughters becoming nuns. In the house at Oxburgh there is an attractive votive painting showing the family of Sir Henry under the protection of Our Lady's mantle: Sir Henry is depicted in his armour and two of his daughters are in their nun's habits, while in the background there are two scenes depicting his escape from the battle at Marston Moor and his subsequent departure overseas. It is true to say that, notwithstanding its connections among the recusant families of East Anglia and further afield, the immediate circle of the Bedingfields at this time was as likely to be found on the continent as in England.<br>
<br>The continental connection was most pronounced through the branch of the family which resided at Redlingfield and which was descended from John, the third son of Sir Henry Bedingfeld (1509&times;11&#150;1583). John was a known harbourer of priests and was reputed always to have kept a priest in his house. This was a tradition maintained by his son Francis (<i>d</i>. 1644), who also educated his children on the continent, where they were to make a substantial contribution to English Catholic life. Francis and his wife, Katherine Fortescue, had eleven daughters who all became nuns, and it is worth recording some of their careers. Helena (1603&#150;1661), the eldest, went to St Omer when she was eight to live with her grandmother, who was resident there. She was professed in 1622 at the Augustinian house at Louvain where her aunt, Mary Fortescue, was also a nun. In 1629 she was sent with others to establish a house at Bruges; eventually she became prioress of the community, and she retained the position until her death in 1661, when she was succeeded by her niece Mary Bedingfield, who continued as prioress until her own death in 1693. The community at Bruges also included Grace Bedingfield, a sister of Helena, who had been professed at Louvain in 1635, and Elizabeth, the widow of Sir Alexander Hamilton and the mother of Mary, who was prioress in 1661. Margaret, the second daughter of Francis, joined the Poor Clares at Gravelines in 1624, and moved in 1645 to the community of Rouen where she too became the superior. A younger sister, Anne (1623&#150;1697), also joined the Poor Clares at Gravelines; she was professed in 1639 and elected as abbess in 1667, a post which she held for thirty years until her death. The third daughter, Philippa (<i>d</i>. 1636), entered the Benedictine community at Ghent, being professed as Sister Thecla in 1630; she died there on 14 December 1636, having filled the office of infirmarer. Catherine, the sixth daughter (1614&#150;1650), entered the Carmelite convent at Antwerp in 1632, taking the name Lucy. She was subsequently sent to the convent at D&uuml;sseldorf as sub-prioress, but was recalled to Antwerp, where she died in 1650 as prioress. Another sister, Magdalen (1621&#150;1684), also joined the Antwerp Carmelites and subsequently moved to D&uuml;sseldorf, where she became sub-prioress and then prioress. She was then chosen to head a new community, established by Philip, elector palatine of the Rhine, at Newburg, and remained there until her death in 1684. Her reputation for sanctity was enhanced in 1727, when her body was found to be entire and &#145;the habit she was buried in whole and not the least rotted&#146;  (Coleridge, 54). Three other sisters joined the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the order recently founded by Mary Ward. Winifred (1610&#150;1666) had been entrusted to the care of Mary Ward as a young woman and later joined the institute; she became head of the Munich house in 1631, when the community there faced financial ruin. Despite her youth she was an effective administrator and leader, freeing the house from debt before her death in 1666.<br>
<br>Another sister, Mary, also joined the institute, but the most celebrated member of this impressive sisterhood was <a name="cosubject_46316"></a><span class="headword">Frances Bedingfield</span>  (1616&#150;1704)<span class="occ"></span>. Frances went to Rome in 1632 to join Mary Ward, who was regrouping the remnants of her suppressed order there, and was professed on 8 September 1633 in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Frances remained a close companion of the founder, returning to England with her and remaining with her until her death at Heworth near York in 1645. At some date after 1650 Frances went to Paris and then to Rome to assist the superior of the institute; later she was superior of the mother house of the order at Munich. She returned to England, probably in 1667, as superior of the newly established house in Hammersmith in Middlesex. Operating from there she travelled between London and Yorkshire during the 1670s looking for a suitable site on which to establish a community and a school for Catholic girls, with money which her friend Sir Thomas Gascoigne had provided. We have a vivid picture of her in these years, learned in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew but busying herself with practical affairs, both legal and domestic, and with a &#145;majestical presence&#146; which awed those magistrates required to administer the recusancy laws against her  (Kirkus, 43). Frances eventually moved to York in 1685, and on 5 November 1686, with Gascoigne's money, she purchased a house and garden in York on a site just beyond the city walls at Micklegate Bar where she established a community which still exists today, and a school which continued until 1985. The deeds were signed using an alias, Frances Long, which she continued to use during her time at York, and the convent possesses a portrait of their founder revealing a matronly but steely figure. During its early years Frances provided effective leadership to the fledgeling community of nine or ten nuns and to the school, adding a school for poor girls to the establishment in 1699. Her reputation for holiness gained her admirers among the protestant leaders in the city, though this did not protect her from brief periods of imprisonment and the community from harassment during the 1690s&#151;until in 1696 or 1697 she placed the York convent in the care of her great-niece, Dorothy Paston Bedingfield. In 1699, aged eighty-four, she was recalled to the mother house in Munich, where she died on 4 May 1704, the last surviving sister to have had direct contact with the institute's founder.<br>
<br>The lives of all these sisters, in both senses of the word, reveal a history often lost in national accounts: they provided spiritual leadership to religious communities spread across five European states and stretching from York to Munich, as well as an enduring network of contacts for English Catholics abroad which could be replicated in other families, though perhaps not quite so extensively. At least two of the sisters were succeeded in office by other family members, and the importance of these women in sustaining English Catholicism by providing education for gentry children and hospitality to travellers cannot be overestimated. Moreover, the influence of this cousinage endured well into the eighteenth century, as the case of the Caryll family of West Grinstead demonstrates. Frances Bedingfield of Oxburgh, the daughter of the first baronet, married into that family which, in subsequent generations, produced eight Benedictine nuns, two Augustinian canonesses, two nuns of the Holy Sepulchre, two Benedictine monks, and three Jesuits, who served their co-religionists at home and abroad. The Redlingfield branch provided a base for a Jesuit mission in the later seventeenth century and, as recusants, registered their lands at the annual value of &pound;275 11<i>s</i>. 1/2<i>d</i>. in 1715. The cost of their recusancy, and the succession of children into the clergy and religious life, resulted in the family line having no direct heirs, and the Redlingfield property was sold some time before 1747, when it was owned by the Willis family.<br>
<br>The century following the accession of Elizabeth I had taken its toll on the fortunes of the family, whose commitment to Catholicism had cost it much in financial terms, so that the estate was somewhat diminished and decayed by the Restoration. The family then regained its chief properties and returned to reside at Oxburgh in 1666 following the marriage of the first baronet's son, <a name="cosubject_76395"></a><span class="headword">Henry Bedingfield</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1704)<span class="occ"></span>, to Lady Anne Howard (<i>d</i>. 1682). The newlyweds lived at Oxburgh and, following the death of his father in 1685, the second baronet set about restoring the house and estate, making it the centre of a Jesuit mission and becoming well known for the hospitality he provided there. Despite the financial and legal penalties which continued to inconvenience Roman Catholics, from this period the Bedingfields could now settle to the life of country landowners, entering into the social if not the political life of the county and acting as supportive landlords to the tenantry on their estates. A period of renewed prosperity meant that outwardly the lifestyle of the family did not differ greatly from that of their protestant neighbours, though domestically it continued to be marked by their Catholic piety and their children were still educated abroad. Following the death of Anne in 1682, the second baronet married Elizabeth Arundell (<i>d</i>. 1690), and in 1699 their son, <a name="cosubject_76396"></a><span class="headword">Henry Arundell Bedingfield</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1760)<span class="occ"></span>, travelled to Lierre, where his three sisters were staying at the convent with their aunt Margaret and two of their Eyre cousins who were nuns there, probably to attend the celebrations on the fiftieth anniversary of the convent. Henry and his sisters then moved on to Brussels with Henry's tutor, Thomas Marwood, whose diary records their stay there and provides details of the extensive networks of English Catholics in the Low Countries at this time and the social and religious milieu in which they lived. The Bedingfield daughters returned to Lierre to continue their education before they moved on to the Benedictine convent at Dunkirk, where one of their Caryll aunts was abbess. Henry Arundell and Marwood remained behind in Brussels, where Henry's education was continued by his tutor and the Jesuits, who had a school there. They left Brussels later in 1700 and, travelling under the alias of Nelson, Henry Arundell moved around the Low Countries with his tutor, often staying with family members at various convents until, in January 1701, they arrived in Paris on their way to the Jesuit college at La Fl&ecirc;che. This college, which had English Jesuits on its staff, educated a number of English Catholic gentlemen; among them Henry Arundell found a friend from another Norfolk family, James Waldegrave, with whom he spent one holiday travelling to Mont-St Michel, as well as sons of other well-known recusant families: Brudenell, Scrope, Browne, and Widdrington. Henry Arundell remained at the school until 1705 when, following the death of his father a few months earlier on 14 September 1704, he returned briefly to Oxburgh before setting out on the grand tour in 1710. He returned again to Oxburgh in 1713 and set about improving the estate and remodelling the house, rebuilding the south-east wing. Henry Arundell continued as a Roman Catholic, registering his Norfolk estates at the annual value of &pound;1551 in 1715, though he later married a protestant, Lady Elizabeth Boyle (<i>d</i>. 1755), daughter of the earl of Burlington. Their son, Richard, was educated abroad by the Jesuits at St Omer, but despite having Jacobite sympathies the family accommodated itself to the Hanoverian regime. It continued to produce priests, and a cousin of Henry Arundell, Anthony, of the Redlingfield branch, joined the Jesuits and was ordained priest at Ghent in 1723. Anthony worked at Flixton in Suffolk during the 1730s and later in Liverpool before eventually returning to Flanders, where he died at Li&egrave;ge on 2 June 1752. Henry Arundell Bedingfield died at Oxburgh on 15 July 1760.<br>
<br>The family's adherence to Catholicism throughout the period cost it dearly both in political power and financially throughout the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries, though some recovery was seen after 1700. Its close association with the Stuarts led to two members of the family, from cadet branches, achieving public positions in the law, albeit briefly: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1939/', "Sir Thomas Bedingfield (1591/2&#150;1661)")</script> was appointed a serjeant-at-law by Charles II at the Restoration, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1937/', "Sir Henry Bedingfield (bap. 1632, d. 1687)")</script> acted as chief justice of the common pleas under James II. To that degree the story of the Bedingfields is representative of the history of post-Reformation English Catholicism, but unexceptionally so, as there was no martyr and the family kept aloof from plots. What marks it out as exceptional in these years, however, is the number of members, especially among the women, who entered the religious life, and the influence which they exercised on the English Catholic community abroad, as leaders of religious communities, educators of the sons and daughters of the Catholic gentry, and providers of hospitality to their co-religionists. In this respect their experience testifies to the close contact between English and continental Catholicism during this period, contact often overlooked in the traditional accounts of the social isolation of Catholic gentry families within English society at the time.<br>
<br>Under the terms of her will of 1513, Margaret, widow of Sir Edmund Bedingfield, established a chantry chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity in Oxburgh parish church, which became the burial place for succeeding generations of the family and the location of a number of monuments and memorials to its members.<br>
