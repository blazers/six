<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ferguson,  Richard Saul</span>  (1837&#150;1900), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born on 28 July 1837 at his parents' home in Abbey Street, Carlisle, was the elder son of Joseph Ferguson (1794&#150;1880), cotton merchant and manufacturer, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1841), daughter of Silas Saul of Carlisle. The Ferguson family had settled in Carlisle in the 1740s, founding the cotton industry in the city and becoming prominent members of the civic &eacute;lite. Educated at Carlisle grammar school and, from 1853, Shrewsbury School, Ferguson was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge, as a scholar on 14 March 1856; he graduated BA in 1860, and proceeded MA in 1863 and LLM in 1874. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 11 October 1858, and was called to the bar on 13 June 1862, when he began to practise in London as an equity draftsman and conveyancer, and joined the northern circuit. He was examiner of civil law for Cambridge University in 1868&#150;9.<br>
<br>In August 1867 Ferguson married, at Kew, Georgiana Fanny, eldest daughter of Spencer Shelley of Richmond House, Kew, principal clerk of the Treasury. The marriage did not last: the couple separated in 1872, and he divorced her in December 1877. They had one son and one daughter. The failure of his marriage coincided with a breakdown in health for which travel to warmer climes was prescribed. From January 1871 to June 1872 he travelled in Egypt, Australia, and America, and he subsequently published an account of his experiences in <span class="italic">Moss Gathered by a Rolling Stone</span> (1873).<br>
<br>In 1874 Ferguson settled in Carlisle and devoted himself to the study of local antiquities and to public service in his native city. While living in London he had already written an account of Lanercost Priory (with his brother, Charles John Ferguson) and two biographical works, of Cumbrian Quakers and of Cumberland and Westmorland members of parliament. In 1866 he had also played a leading role in the foundation of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society. He was the founding editor of the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and, from 1886, served as its president, and was remembered as &#145;the heart and soul of the Society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions</span>, old ser., 16, 1900, x). Ferguson possessed the means and leisure to pursue with vigour his interest in the antiquities and history of Cumberland and Westmorland. His trained mind, organizational powers, energy, and &#145;enthusiastic affection&#146;  (ibid.) for the counties were central to the late nineteenth-century renaissance of antiquarian study in present-day Cumbria.<br>
<br>Ferguson published extensively, contributing volumes for Cumberland (1890) and Westmorland (1894) to Elliot Stock's <span class="roman">Popular County Histories</span>. Of lasting importance were his editions of manuscript sources, published by the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society. These included William Nicolson's <span class="italic">Miscellany Accounts of the Diocese of Carlisle</span> (1877), the descriptions of Cumberland by the seventeenth-century antiquaries John Denton, Sir Daniel Fleming, and Edmund Sandford, Hugh Todd's accounts of Carlisle city and diocese, urban records of Carlisle and Kendal, and <span class="italic">Testamenta Karleolensia</span> (1893), a volume of early wills proved at Carlisle. He had been commissioned to act as editor of the projected <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> of Cumberland shortly before his death.<br>
<br>Ferguson was made a magistrate of the county of Cumberland in 1872, and a member of the Carlisle city bench in 1881. In 1886 he was elected chairman of quarter sessions. He was elected a member of the Carlisle city council in 1878, and used his position to gain access to the muniments of the city, many of which he published. He was mayor in 1881&#150;2 and was re-elected in the following year. A staunch Conservative and a strong supporter of the city privileges, he lost no opportunity of championing the rights of the city when county councils were instituted in 1889 and he was elected to the new body to represent Carlisle. He took the leading role in the project by which Tullie House was acquired by the city and developed into a museum, public library, school of science and art, and art gallery. Under his influence, the collection of Roman antiquities at Tullie House Museum became extensive and valuable, and the city was bequeathed the Jackson collection, which remains the core of Carlisle's local studies library. Ferguson was also prominent in local efforts to preserve the appearance and fabric of Carlisle Castle, then still occupied by the military, and his advice was both sought and heeded by the army authorities. In 1891, for instance, he was in the forefront of opposition to War Office plans for married soldiers' quarters, which would have blocked the view of the castle from the city, and he helped to secure a change of policy. In recognition of his services the corporation conferred upon him the honorary freedom of the city in 1896.<br>
<br>In 1887 the bishop of Carlisle, Harvey Goodwin, appointed Ferguson chancellor of the diocese, an office which had not hitherto been held by a layman. Ferguson was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 1 March 1877, member of the Royal Archaeological Institute about 1878, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1880. In 1895 he was admitted an honorary member of the Glasgow Archaeological Association. He was a vice-president of the Royal Archaeological Institute and of the Surtees Society. Latterly, Chancellor Ferguson, a portly, patriarchal figure with a flowing beard, suffered seriously from asthma, which was blamed for straining his heart. He died at Carlisle on 3 March 1900, at his home, 74 Lowther Street, and was buried on 7 March 1900 in the family vault in Stanwix churchyard, Carlisle.<br>
