<div class="para">
<span class="headword">James,  Edward Frank Willis</span>  (1907&#150;1984), <span class="occ">art patron</span>, was born on 16 August 1907 at Greywalls, Gullane, East Lothian, the youngest of five children of William James (<i>d</i>. 1912), landed gentleman, and Evelyn Elizabeth (1869&#150;1929), eldest daughter of Sir Charles Forbes, fourth baronet, of Castle Newe, Aberdeenshire. His father was of American extraction, his mother Scottish. During his mother's childhood she became friendly with the future king and queen, Edward VII and Alexandra. The king became Edward's godfather, and it was often rumoured that he was the father of the boy. Correspondence between Evelyn James and the royal couple suggests that this was most unlikely. There is, however, considerable evidence that Colonel John (Dosie) Brinton may have been Edward's real father; William James was probably left impotent after a severe attack of mumps about 1889. However, James never mentioned that William might not have been his father.<br>
<br>William James died when Edward was only four, leaving him in the hands of the most demanding and possessive of mothers; his childhood and adolescence were eased only by the kindness of Dosie Brinton. Edward was sent to Le Rosey, a private school in Switzerland, and was brought home to attend crammers to prepare him for the Eton College entrance exam. He was there from 1920 to 1924, and won the Geoffrey Gunther memorial drawing prize, presented to him with a flattering commendation by Roger Fry. James went up to Christ Church, Oxford, from 1926 to 1928. He first read history, but in his second year changed to modern languages, doing little of either and leaving Oxford without a degree. But he made his name by the flamboyant decoration of his rooms and by his lavish entertaining.<br>
<br>James published his first book of poems in 1926, the start of a long line of &#145;vanity&#146; publications which appeared during the next thirty years. He became friends with John Betjeman, subsidizing the Oxford University student newspaper the <span class="italic">Cherwell</span>, which Betjeman then edited, and in 1931 publishing Betjeman's first book of poems, <span class="italic">Mount Zion</span>, under the imprint the James Press. Much of his energy at this time was spent in freeing himself from the interference of his mother. Her death in 1929 solved some of his problems, and shortly afterwards the inheritance of huge fortunes from his father and his late uncle Frank created many others.<br>
<br>In his new-found independence, aided by his great wealth, James's eccentricity began to emerge. During a short honorary posting at the British embassy in Rome he mainly distinguished himself by engineering a personal appointment with Mussolini, but the Duce, seeing his youth through the door, refused to see him. In 1928 he had a more fateful meeting in London with the beautiful dancer Ottilie Ethel (Tilly) Losch (<i>c</i>.1904&#150;1975). This led to their disastrous marriage in New York in 1931, which deeply affected his future. It has been suggested that Losch agreed to the marriage for financial security, in the certain belief that Edward was homosexual and that the marriage could be rapidly terminated. Living in New York, Losch was overtly unfaithful to James, who sued for divorce; in 1934 she counter-sued for cruelty and homosexuality. There was not a shred of evidence to support her charges and she lost the case. In theory, society at that time ostracized husbands who divorced their wives. James complained that he was cut by old friends, but in reality he was moving into a more bohemian world of artists and composers, spending much of his time on the continent.<br>
<br>In 1931 James, already sensing a coldness in Losch, determined to win back her affections by creating a ballet in which she would be the prima ballerina. The project was finally realized when James met Georges Balanchine in Paris, struggling to launch his new ballet company. With James's money everyone's dream became a reality, and Les Ballets 1933 put on brief performances in Paris and London, with Losch in two starring roles. But she failed to attend the final party James gave for the company at the Savoy. His generous patronage of Les Ballets failed to win back Losch, but it did launch Balanchine on a meteoric career in America, an achievement James seems never to have noticed. However, the Frenchwomen like Marie-Laure de Noailles who had encouraged his patronage led him on to support several important contemporary French composers.<br>
<br>During the 1930s James spent more and more time travelling throughout Europe and renting the beautiful Villa Cimbrone above Ravello which he regarded as his home. He returned to England from time to time for brief stays at his London house, 35 Wimpole Street, bombed during the Second World War, and at West Dean Park and the smaller Monkton House, which Lutyens had built for William James on the nearby South Downs. This nomadic way of life continued thereafter until James's death: from Europe to America to Mexico, to a last few years in Italy.<br>
<br>In the early 1930s James became attracted by contemporary painting and above all by the surrealists and the work of Salvador Dal&iacute;. James said he first became aware of Dal&iacute;'s painting when in 1932, staying with the Noailles at Hy&egrave;res, he saw the artist's striking portrait of Marie-Laure. Exactly when he first met Dal&iacute; is uncertain but was probably at some time in 1933 at Hy&egrave;res. James was much attracted by the young Catalan painter, and in December 1936 he signed a contract with Dal&iacute;, purchasing all the work he produced between June 1937 and June 1938. Dal&iacute; claimed later that Edward had all his best work. Dal&iacute;'s paintings&#151;others acquired at other times&#151;became the crowning glory of James's collection of paintings; many of the best pictures were bought in the 1930s though he continued to collect until late in his life. He also had a fine collection of works by Magritte, de Chirico, Picasso, Paul Delvaux, Pavel Tchelitchew, and Leonora Carrington. James hated to be thought of as a collector&#151;an academic, uncreative word. He liked to think of himself as a creative patron, to some extent involved in the creative process.<br>
<br>Thus motivated, late in 1935 James decided to refurbish Monkton, the Lutyens house he always thought &#145;too cottagey&#146;. He took Dal&iacute; to the first meeting with the architects, Kit Nicholson and Hugh Casson. Casson had said that Dal&iacute; mixed the purple colour for the outside walls but thereafter had nothing to do with the &#145;surrealization&#146; of the house, whose interior was put into the hands of a decorator, Norris Wakefield.<br>
<br>James continued to publish books of poetry and was deeply hurt by Stephen Spender's cutting review in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> of <span class="italic">The Bones of my Hand</span> (1938). Occasionally James did write moving poetry, but much of his work was too self-conscious. His inspiration in the late 1930s was the beautiful film star Ruth Ford who&#151;though fond of Edward&#151;like Losch was more interested in his wealth and certainly never intended to marry him. In February 1939 Edward sailed for New York, to help with some of Dal&iacute;'s projects, and did not return to England until 1947.<br>
<br>In 1940 James decided to settle in California, but in May he visited the artists' colony, Taos, made famous by D. H. Lawrence in the 1920s, and was drawn to Los Angeles by the hope of friendship with Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard, and, on his own written admission, by homosexuality. He found the latter but failed to make friends with Huxley, Heard, or other famous people in Los Angeles. He lived a desultory life in Los Angeles, moving from house to apartment to hotel. Always impractical, and obsessively clean, he covered every surface with tissues until, forced to dispose of them, he pushed them down the lavatory; when it was totally clogged, he tried to clear it by setting fire to the paper, and often the room.<br>
<br>In 1944, staying with a friend in Cuernavaca, James fell in love with Mexico and, more deeply, with Plutarco Gastelum in the local telegraph office. This passion for Mexico and Gastelum filled most of the last chapter of James's life. In 1945 he discovered Xilitla, and in 1947 they bought the first land there, adding to it later. Gastelum married, had children, and built a large house in the village, where Edward lodged in one wing. The mountains rose steeply on one side of their land, with waterfalls running down the slopes. James was enchanted and started by planting thousands of imported orchids. Next he introduced various species of animals but he soon learned that he could not keep them without cages. This led to the idea of enriching the exotic landscape with highly coloured surrealist architecture. With the help of local labour and the practical talents of Gastelum, the Entrance Tower, the Summer Palace, the Plaza San Eduardo, and several other polychromed concrete buildings began to rise high above the shade of the tropical forest. James's imagination created a place of intriguing beauty.<br>
<br>James had long been a tax exile, and his visits to England were limited. Strangely, while trying to curry favour with Huxley, he had written to ask him to help convert West Dean Park into some kind of artistic community. The house was then offered to several institutions, all of which refused it. In November 1964 James gave the house and much of his land to the Edward James Foundation, including the furnishings in the house and the greater part of his art collection. He kept Monkton with 500 acres. It was a munificent gift, but as yet the trust had no precise purpose. It was not until 1969 that Major-General Cyril Lloyd, formerly director-general of the City and Guilds, suggested to the trustees the foundation of an arts and crafts college, which opened in 1971. Strangely, James never mentioned the similar scheme he had suggested to Huxley.<br>
<br>James, at first enthusiastic, never appreciated that the college could not be launched without considerable capital, which could have been raised by the sale of furniture and pictures. When in England he sniped at the college from Monkton, but retired for most of the time to a friend's house in Perinaldo, near San Remo, until, dissatisfied with that, he moved to a nearby restaurant. In early autumn 1984 he became ill there and the ever-patient owner drove him to Paris, where he collapsed on reaching his hotel. Eventually he returned to a nursing home in San Remo where he died on 2 December 1984. He was buried, at his wish, in the arboretum at West Dean.<br>
