<span class="headword">Kingdon,  Emmeline Maria</span>  (1817&#150;1890), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was probably born at Bridgerule, Devon, the youngest daughter of the Revd Thomas Hockin Kingdon (1775&#150;1853), rector of Pyworthy and vicar of Bridgerule, and his wife, Caroline, eldest daughter of Samuel Nicholson of Ham Common, Surrey. The couple also had three sons, two of whom, Samuel Nicholson and George Thomas, became clerics, eventually succeeding their father at Bridgerule and Pyworthy respectively. The youngest son, Paul Augustine, became a barrister.<br>
<br>Following her mother's death Kingdon kept house for her father, assisted him with his business affairs and with parish duties, and devoted considerable time to the village school. After her father's death in 1853 Kingdon made a number of visits to friends and relatives. As did many unmarried females of her time and class, she provided support to the households in which she stayed when required, though it is not known whether she pursued her educational interests during this time.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1864 Kingdon answered an advertisement for the post of lady superintendent for a new school to be opened in Bath in the following year. The Royal School for Daughters of Officers of the Army was the brainchild of the philanthropist Alfred Douglas Hamilton, who knew of an existing institution of a similar nature, the Royal Female Naval School at Richmond, established in 1840. The advertisement attracted a total of seventy-six applications; according to an obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, Kingdon's success in securing the post was in part due to a testimonial from Florence Nightingale, whom she appears to have met at some point during her travels following the death of her father.<br>
<br>The Royal School occupied an imposing, and domestically inconvenient, neo-Gothic building on Lansdown, Bath, and much time during Kingdon's early months as lady superintendent was spent overseeing its conversion into accommodation suitable for girls and governesses. The school officially opened on 24 August 1865. It had thirty pupils, over half of whom, from needy families, had been &#145;elected&#146; at reduced fees, and three governesses, though the number of pupils expanded rapidly both during and after Kingdon's time. Discipline in the new school was strict; Kingdon imposed a rigorous routine on her charges.<br>
<br>The Royal School's educational aims were twofold: to imbue its pupils with the habits and attitudes of &#145;gentlewomen&#146;, while also giving them, as the school's founding committee expressed it, &#145;sound and useful knowledge together with such accomplishments and such practice in domestic economy as might qualify them for a useful situation in life&#146;  (Osborne and Manisty, 26). The curriculum, devised by Kingdon, included vocational subjects such as English, arithmetic, and French, as well as &#145;aesthetic subjects&#146; such as music, drawing, and deportment, and was thus typical of the curricula to be found in girls' schools by the 1870s. It reflected wider contemporary debates about the education of middle-class girls and women which attempted to reconcile the conflicting demands of the philosophy of a liberal education and the need for increasing numbers of middle-class women to earn a livelihood with Victorian conceptions of femininity.<br>
<br>Kingdon remained as lady superintendent until her retirement in July 1874. She returned only a year later, however, after the school had encountered problems with Miss Rosa Adams, her replacement. Kingdon remained with the school in her resumed post for a further six years, until ill health&#151;a stroke, resulting in paralysis&#151;led to permanent retirement in July 1882. During this time she continued to consolidate the school's academic credentials, with considerable success: in 1876 pupils from the Royal School were entered for the Cambridge University local examinations.<br>
<br>In appearance Kingdon was &#145;a dear little stately lady in a lace cap&#146;  (Osborne and Manisty, 31); one photograph suggests a likeness to the school's patron, Queen Victoria. Like her more famous contemporary, Miss Buss, Kingdon was described as possessing a maternal and sympathetic nature. Past pupils recalled her kindness, self-control, and &#145;an indescribable air of distinction&#146;  (ibid.). The emphasis of these testimonies on their subject's womanly qualities is typical, but Kingdon's formidable administrative and managerial skills&#151;which drew praise from the educationist Joshua Fitch whom the committee invited to inspect the school in 1875&#151;and her role in attaining a high reputation for the school should also be noted. Emmeline Maria Kingdon, who was unmarried, died at her home, 1 Dynham Road, West Hampstead, London, on 25 March 1890, and was buried on 29 March at Paddington cemetery.<br>
