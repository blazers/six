</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pereira,  Jonathan</span>  (1804&#150;1853), <span class="occ">pharmacologist and physician</span>, was born on 22 May 1804 in Shoreditch, London, the son of Daniel Lopes Pereira, a Lloyd's underwriter of Portuguese-Jewish extraction. He acquired the rudiments of education at one of the small schools in Shoreditch and from the age of ten attended a &#145;classical academy&#146; in Queen Street, Finsbury, where the master judged him to be a boy of considerable merit. At the age of sixteen Pereira was articled to an apothecary named Latham who had a general medical practice in the City Road but the indentures were cancelled when Latham became mentally ill. In 1821 Pereira became a student at the General Dispensary, Aldersgate Street, and attended courses in chemistry, materia medica, and practical medicine by Henry Clutterbuck, on natural philosophy by George Birkbeck, and on botany by William Lambe. Two months before his nineteenth birthday, on 6 March 1823, he qualified as licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries and was appointed apothecary to the Aldersgate dispensary. He began to study surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital and qualified as a surgeon in 1825.<br>
<br>While acting as an apothecary at the dispensary Pereira discovered his vocation as a teacher. He gave private lessons to medical students and prepared texts to assist them in their studies. In 1823 he published <span class="italic">Synopsis of the Chemical Decomposition that takes place in the Preparations of the London Pharmacopoeia</span>. In 1824 he published his English translation of the newly revised <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia Londinensis</span> and <span class="italic">Selectae e praescriptis</span>, a selection of medical prescriptions. There followed <span class="italic">A Manual for the Use of [Medical] Students</span> (1826) and <span class="italic">A General Table of Atomic Numbers with an Introduction to Atomic Theory</span> (1827). In 1826 he succeeded Clutterbuck as lecturer in chemistry at the Aldersgate dispensary and two years later began to teach the courses in materia medica. About this time he was made a fellow of the Linnean Society and was a member of the Phrenological Society and the Meteorological Society. In the years that followed he achieved considerable success as a teacher and was described as a man of commanding appearance, looking older than his years, who retained the interest of his audience by the novelty of his facts. Attendances at his courses generated a large income, sufficient to enable him to build a new lecture theatre at his own expense. His teaching and duties at the dispensary left him little time for original work and he published only one paper between 1827 and 1835.<br>
<br>In 1832 Pereira married Louisa Jane Lucas, resigned his office of apothecary at the dispensary and set up in medical practice in Aldersgate Street near his home in Finsbury Square. He was appointed professor of materia medica at the new medical school in Aldersgate Street and lecturer in chemistry at the London Hospital. He declined an invitation to become professor of chemistry and materia medica at St Bartholomew's Hospital because the by-laws required him to relinquish all other posts. His lectures in materia medica, published in the <span class="italic">Medical Gazette</span> between 1835 and 1837, were translated into German and republished in India. In 1838 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>In 1840 Pereira resolved to leave London and graduate from one of the universities in Scotland but changed his mind when he was told of the prospect of a vacancy in the post of assistant physician to the London Hospital. At short notice he prepared for and passed the licentiate examination of the Royal College of Physicians. He also obtained an MD from Erlangen, and on 3 March 1841 was appointed to the post at the London Hospital. In 1845 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was made a member of the pharmacopoeial committee and curator of the museum. He became full physician at the London Hospital in 1851.<br>
<br>From 1842 Pereira devoted much of his time and energy to the completion of the third edition of <span class="italic">The Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics</span>, which was his major work. The first edition based on his published lectures appeared in 1839 and an enlarged second edition followed in 1842. The third revision attempted to resolve problems relating to the identification, action, and use of medicinal substances, and place the knowledge of the action of drugs on an organized and scientific basis. The first volume of this encyclopaedic work was published in 1849 and was devoted to general pharmacology and the inorganic bodies used in therapy. Pereira saw the first part of the second volume through the press in 1850 but the final part was incomplete at the time of his death. It was published in 1853, having been completed by Alfred Swaine Taylor and George Owen Rees. Pereira's treatise, published at a time when pharmacology was evolving into an experimental science, surpassed all other works on materia medica, introducing readers to a detailed scientific and clinical knowledge of each of the medicinal agents then in use.<br>
<br>At the time that he was revising his book on the materia medica Pereira was closely associated with the newly formed Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. He gave active support to Jacob Bell, whose objective was to raise the status of pharmacy in Britain and promote the advancement of pharmaceutical science. In 1842 Pereira had expressed his opinion that the low state of pharmacy in Britain was due to the want of a scientific education by practising chemists and druggists. His reputation and enthusiasm for the improvement of pharmacy were of great value to the founders of the Pharmaceutical Society in its early years when it was opposed by sections of the medical establishment and from within the trade itself. Pereira became a close friend of Bell and had considerable influence on the editorial policy of the <span class="italic">Pharmaceutical Journal</span>, contributing numerous articles on the materia medica. He became professor of materia medica at the School of Pharmacy and encouraged Bell to form a committee of leading scientists and pharmacists for the advancement of pharmacology. The object of the committee was to gather and sift information on the natural history and uses of substances employed in medicine. Pereira observed that no country possessed so many facilities for carrying out these enquiries as Great Britain, which governed colonies all over the world. When he resigned as professor of materia medica at the London Hospital in 1851 he presented his collection of specimens to the Pharmaceutical Society. His contributions to their evening meetings became the subjects of two books: <span class="italic">Lectures on Polarized Light</span> and <span class="italic">A Treatise on Food and Diet</span>, both published in 1843. Foodstuffs were discussed in the first editions of the <span class="italic">Elements of Materia Medica</span> but the publication of Justus von Liebig's <span class="italic">Animal Chemistry</span> in 1842 necessitated a revision, and Pereira, in his treatise, gave an account of the chemical elements of food in addition to the alimentary principles and dietetical treatments of disease.<br>
<br>Pereira's letters to Jacob Bell reveal him to have been a very hard-working good-humoured man, direct and frank in his manner, tolerant when the occasion demanded. He was charged by some with a want of originality but this had little effect on his widely held reputation which was built upon his qualities as a teacher and his ability to gather, organize, and record the numerous facts and disparate theories relating to the materia medica and the actions of medicines. His thirty-page &#145;Tabular view of the history and literature of the materia medica&#146; in the third edition of the <span class="italic">Elements</span> is an indication of the range of his studies. He made it a rule, whenever possible, to have firsthand experience of the substance or species he was describing in his book. It was for this purpose that he was visiting the Hunterian Museum in December 1852 when he fell on the stairs and ruptured muscles and tendons in both legs. Disabled and in pain he continued to write until 20 January 1853 when he collapsed with severe chest pains and died that same day, at 47 Finsbury Square. He was buried in the cemetery at Kensal Green. He was survived by his wife.<br>
