<span class="headword">Aldington,  Edward Godfree <span class="st"> [Richard]</span></span>  (1892&#150;1962), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 8 July 1892 at 50 High Street, Portsmouth, the eldest among the two sons and two daughters of Albert Edward Aldington (1864&#150;1921), bookseller and stationer, and later solicitor's clerk and amateur author, and Jessie May Godfree (1872&#150;1954), novelist and keeper of the Mermaid inn at Rye. After preparatory schools at Walmer and St Margaret's Bay, Aldington, known from a young age as Richard, attended Dover College from 1904 to 1906. He started to write poetry in the following year, aged fifteen, after reading Wilde and Keats. In 1910 he enrolled at University College, London, where he encountered W. P. Ker and A. E. Housman, but he had to leave before taking his degree after his father's speculations failed.<br>
<br>Aldington worked briefly as assistant to a newspaper sports editor, but was soon making a living from his literary journalism and poetry. In 1912 he was introduced by Ethel Elizabeth (Brigit) Patmore (1882&#150;1965) to avant-garde writers, including Yeats; Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford); Ezra Pound, who became his close friend and literary ally; and the American poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57461/', "Hilda Doolittle, known as H. D. (1886&#150;1961)")</script>. Pound, H. D., and Aldington founded the influential imagist movement in 1912, rejecting regular stanzaic forms in favour of <i>vers libre</i>, and nineteenth-century poetical language in favour of sparse, concrete, highly visual presentation. Aldington's work appeared in <span class="italic">Des imagistes</span> (1914, edited by Pound), and he helped Amy Lowell edit the three volumes called <span class="italic">Some Imagist Poets</span> (1915, 1916, 1917). His first book of poems, <span class="italic">Images, 1910&#150;1915</span>, was published by Harold Monro's Poetry Bookshop in 1915. He became literary editor of Dora Marsden's feminist magazine <span class="italic">New Freewoman</span> (later <span class="italic">The Egoist</span>), to which Pound also contributed. Aldington and H. D. became lovers in 1912, while in Paris with Pound. In the following year they spent eight months in Italy and France, and were married on 18 October 1913 in Kensington register office.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the First World War, Aldington tried to join up in the Honourable Artillery Company, but was told he would be refused because of a childhood hernia operation. He worked instead as secretary to Ford, assisting with his propaganda writing and Ford's novel <span class="italic">The Good Soldier</span>. H. D. had discovered she was pregnant on the day war was declared. A daughter was stillborn on 21 May 1915. On 24 June 1916 Aldington joined the 11th battalion of the Devonshire regiment at Wareham, Dorset. He embarked on 21 December 1916, and saw active service in France and Flanders, first attached to the 6th battalion of the Leicestershire regiment as a private, and transferred to the 11th battalion in January 1917. He stayed in France until the end of May, and was back in England for officer training from June to the end of November, when he got his commission in the Royal Sussex regiment. In London he met T. S. Eliot, who took over his editorial duties for <span class="italic">The Egoist</span>, and also the American art student Dorothy (Arabella) Yorke (1891&#150;1971), who lived above the Aldingtons at 44 Mecklenburgh Square, and with whom Richard began an affair. He and H. D. had separated by autumn 1919 although they continued to write to each other until H. D.'s death.<br>
<br>Aldington was back in the trenches from April 1918; by November he was signals officer to battalion headquarters, with the rank of acting captain. After the armistice he was in Belgium teaching arithmetic and English grammar to the troops, before being gazetted out in February 1919. Besides traumatic stress, he suffered from chronic bronchitis due to exposure to gas.<br>
<br>In 1919 Aldington's poems <span class="italic">War and Love</span> were published. He began to work for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> as a regular reviewer of French books. From autumn 1919 to 1927 he and Arabella were based in Berkshire, though they travelled frequently, especially in France. He was assistant editor for Eliot's <span class="italic">Criterion</span> from 1921, specializing in reviews of French poetry. He produced over twenty books of criticism and thirty books of translation, especially from the French, such as <span class="italic">Les liaisons dangereuses</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Candide</span> (1927). His biographical study <span class="italic">Voltaire</span> (1925) was praised for objectivity and masterly concision.<br>
<br>During the general strike of 1926 Aldington was asked to help deliver <span class="italic">The Times</span> and obliged. However, though his friendships were predominantly with right-inclined writers such as Eliot, Pound, Wyndham Lewis, and later Roy Campbell, Aldington was equally scathing about all political or religious systems. He was an epicurean individualist, who resented any threat to individual fulfilment, whether from communism, capitalism, bureaucracy, or Christianity.<br>
<br>Aldington was expected to become editor of the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span> but after a visit from D. H. Lawrence&#151;whom he had known since 1914, and who was the modern novelist he most admired&#151;he decided he needed to write more personally, and to make a decisive break with England, and with Eliot's influence. Aldington spent most of the next decade in France. He became friendly with Nancy Cunard, with whom he discovered a new young writer called Samuel Beckett.<br>
<br>In autumn 1928 Aldington stayed at Port-Cros (an island near Hy&egrave;res) with the Lawrences, and with Brigit Patmore, his new love. They visited the Pounds at Rapallo, where the Yeatses were also staying. Aldington wrote little poetry after his late thirties but entered a new phase as a novelist, writing seven novels from 1929 to 1939. His first, the anti-war book <span class="italic">Death of a Hero</span> (1929), made him famous: George Orwell thought it &#145;much the best of the English war books&#146;  (Doyle, 128) while Aldington thought of it as a &#145;jazz novel&#146;  (ibid., 129). It was a watershed in Aldington's career, and also the first real intimation of his satirical power: an angry denunciation of Victorian hypocrisy and social stupidity crushing individual happiness. These were his main fictional targets. <span class="italic">Death of a Hero</span> is also a rawly autobiographical work, expressing his anger towards his parents (especially his mother), the war, and the literary establishment, with recognizable satiric portraits of Eliot, Ford, Lawrence, and Pound.<br>
<br>Aldington's satire of modernist friends intensified in <span class="italic">Soft Answers</span> (1932), with biting caricatures of Pound and Eliot. Aldington objected to what he saw as Eliot's death wish; &#145;the War despair which involved so many of us and from which the healthy-minded have been struggling to escape&#146;  (Doyle, 148&#150;9). In <span class="italic">Artifex</span> (1935) he elaborated his attack on the modernist movement as &#145;the art of exasperated neurasthenics&#146;  (pp. 33&#150;4), on the grounds that art should intensify and enrich life. The satire of his second novel, <span class="italic">The Colonel's Daughter</span> (1931), is aimed at a similar target: the life-denying stupidity of English village society.<br>
<br>Aldington spent the early 1930s in Mediterranean Europe: he was with Patmore at the Villa Koeclin, Le Canadel (Var); then at Anacapri, where he worked on his third novel, <span class="italic">All Men are Enemies</span> (1933). His habit of overwork undermined his health, yet he was continually on the move: in Portugal; in France for most of 1933, mainly at Villa Devos, near Le Lavandou; motoring around Spain. He broke his knee in a car accident in Austria. One of his best novels dates from this period: <span class="italic">Women must Work</span> (1934). But during the depression he found it hard to repeat the success of <span class="italic">Death of a Hero</span>; though he became one of Russia's favourite contemporary English writers, thanks partly to Gorky's interest.<br>
<br>By 1935 Aldington felt finished even with Europe, and after a brief stay on a derelict plantation on Tobago he sailed for America in June, where he was based for the next decade, though his semi-nomadic existence regularly returned him to Europe before the Second World War. In winter 1935&#150;6 he was back in London, then touring in Portugal, Spain, and Austria. He became involved with Patmore's daughter-in-law, Netta (1911&#150;1977), daughter of James McCulloch, a lawyer, of Pinner, Middlesex. Early in 1937 Netta went with him to visit Italy and Nice, and to settle at the Villa Koeclin. His divorce from H. D. was finalized on 22 June 1938, and three days later Aldington and Netta married in London. Their daughter, Catherine (Catha), was born on 6 July 1938. In January 1939 they took an apartment on West 115th Street, New York. Aldington gave some lectures at Columbia and other east-coast universities. Late in 1940 they moved to Washington, DC. After the reception of his poem-sequence <span class="italic">The Crystal World</span> (1937) Aldington said: &#145;I promised myself I would never write another line of poetry&#146;  (Doyle, 240). Instead he obtained access to the Library of Congress to edit the substantial <span class="italic">Viking Book of Poetry of the English-Speaking World</span> (1941), which he intended to rival <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of English Verse</span>, and to offer alternative poetic traditions from those defined by Pound and Eliot. Aldington was happy and productive in America, saying &#145;our best time began&#146; there  (ibid., 204). He turned to life-writing for a last creative phase: eight biographical books, starting with his autobiography <span class="italic">Life for Life's Sake</span> (1941). The travelling continued: Jamay Beach, Nokomis, in Florida; Taos, New Mexico, to stay with Frieda Lawrence.<br>
<br>During much of the Second World War, Aldington, who had the appearance of a matin&eacute;e idol, worked as a freelance screenwriter in Hollywood, where he befriended William Faulkner. His biography of the duke of Wellington (1943) won the James Tait Black memorial prize when it was published in the United Kingdom (1946). His last novel, <span class="italic">The Romance of Casanova</span> (1946) was a half-hearted potboiler (written for the movies), but Aldington still needed to pay damages to the Patmores. (The courts awarded damages as part of Netta's divorce from her husband, Michael Patmore.) After the war he left America, saying &#145;the place has nothing to offer but money&#146;  (Doyle, 226&#150;7), and returned to his beloved France: first Paris, where he met the young Australian poet Alister Kershaw, who admired his work and offered loyal friendship, assistance, and financial support for the rest of his life, then from August 1947 the Villa Aucassin, Le Lavandou.<br>
<br>Aldington had edited Lawrence's <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span> (1932), and was now influential in getting Lawrence's prose republished, writing fourteen introductions for Heinemann and Penguin. He also produced the important first biography of Lawrence, <span class="italic">D. H. Lawrence: Portrait of a Genius, but &hellip;</span> (1950). His anthology of the aesthetes, <span class="italic">The Religion of Beauty</span>, appeared in the same year. That autumn Netta left him, and Aldington had what he called &#145;a sort of crack-up&#146;  (Doyle, 252). Unusually for him he did not produce a full-length book for the next four years. <span class="italic">Pinorman</span>, a biography of Norman Douglas and his friends Pino Orioli and Charles Prentice, appeared in 1954, as did the French edition of the book that was to have devastating personal consequences: <span class="italic">Lawrence of Arabia: a Biographical Enquiry</span> (1955). He had intended to produce a study of war-heroism to follow <span class="italic">Wellington</span>, but his careful research produced instead another death of a hero: the first systematic debunking of the legend of T. E. Lawrence, whom Aldington found a liar and fraud. It was, he said, &#145;more than a mere biography&#151;it is the showing up and repudiation of a whole phase of our national life&#146;  (ibid., 274). The British establishment was scandalized. Attempts were made to prevent publication, then to ensure hostile reviews. Aldington's reputation and sales never recovered in the English-speaking world, and he lived in poverty, mainly on translation rights to his own books and his translations of others. In April 1951 Aldington and his daughter Catha left the Villa Aucassin, moving to a <i>pension</i>, Les Rosiers, Montpellier. Lawrence Durrell visited him here, and became another close friend. In 1957 Aldington was able to move to a cottage bought by Alister Kershaw, in the hamlet of Maison Sall&eacute;, Sury-en-Vaux, Cher, which provided his home for the rest of his life&#151;though he continued to travel. His last trip was in summer 1962 to attend celebrations in the USSR for his seventieth birthday, where he was overwhelmed by admiration. He died on 27 July 1962 back at Maison Sall&eacute;, and was buried at Sury-en-Vaux.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary showed how Aldington's scathing criticisms of England remained unforgiven: &#145;He was an angry young man of the generation before they became fashionable&#146;; &#145;There were times when his anger betrayed him&#146;  (30 July 1962). The <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> was more magnanimous: &#145;Aldington's brilliance in so many fields of literature has been rivalled by few of his generation and is indeed rare at any time&#146;  (30 July 1962).<br>
<br>Richard Aldington was extraordinarily prolific and versatile: a poet, novelist, translator, critic, biographer, editor, and anthologist. C. P. Snow called him &#145;a writer of great gifts&#146;, giving his readers &#145;a glow of power and vitality&#146;  (Doyle, xiii). He was an important contributor to modernist poetics, and a significant post-war novelist, though his subsequent repudiation of modernism and reputation for <i>ad hominem</i> denunciations have rather obscured his merits. In many ways a divided figure, he was characterized by acute sensitivity to beauty, passion for truth, and anger at hypocrisy.<br>
