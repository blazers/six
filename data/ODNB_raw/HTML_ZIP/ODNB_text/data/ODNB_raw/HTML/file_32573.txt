<span class="headword">Cornish,  Vaughan</span>  (1862&#150;1948), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 22 December 1862 at Debenham, Suffolk, the third and youngest son of Charles John Cornish (1834&#150;1913), vicar of Debenham, and his wife, Anne Charlotte Western (1831&#150;1887). His father's cousin was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36752/', "Francis Warre Warre-Cornish")</script> and his elder brother was the naturalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32572/', "Charles John Cornish")</script>. He was educated first at home and then, when he was seventeen, at St Paul's School, London. After working as a private tutor he studied chemistry at Victoria University of Manchester. While a student he presented a paper to the British Association with Percy Kendall in 1887; he graduated BSc with first-class honours in 1888, and proceeded MSc in 1892 and DSc in 1901.<br>
<br>In 1891 Cornish married Ellen Agnes (1853&#150;1911), the daughter of Alfred Provis, an artist, of Kingston Lisle, Berkshire. In the same year he became director of technical education for Hampshire county council. Living in a cliff-top house near Branksome Chine, between Bournemouth and Poole, he began his studies of waves, and in 1895 he resigned from his job to devote himself to research. In this he was encouraged and financially supported by his wife, who had private means. Ellen was trained as an engineer, and the couple exercised their scientific interests through worldwide travel, giving up a permanent home. Ellen died in 1911, and is recalled in Cornish's <span class="italic">The Travels of Ellen Cornish: being the Memoir of a Pilgrim of Science</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">Kestell, Clapp and Cornish</span> (1947). Cornish's global experience would later inform his survey of <span class="italic">The Beauties of Scenery</span> (1943). In 1913 he married Mary Louisa, the daughter of William Richards Watson, rector of Saltfleetby, and the widow of his second cousin, the explorer Ernest Ayscoghe Floyer, whose notice he contributed to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. They settled in Camberley, Surrey, though Cornish continued to travel extensively. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Cornish's research on surface waves, to which he gave the label &#145;kumatology&#146;, was primarily observational, and often carried out in extreme conditions. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society Gill memorial prize in 1901. Books such as <span class="italic">Waves of the Sea and other Water Waves</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">The Waves of Sand and Snow</span> (1914) document sand waves in the Libyan desert, wind-blown snow in Canada, and water waves below Niagara and in the mid-Atlantic. Cornish also studied British tidal bores, shooting the first film of the Severn bore in September 1901 from a boat anchored in mid-stream and tracking the Trent &#145;eagre&#146; by car in 1922. His results were summarized in <span class="italic">Ocean Waves and Kindred Geophysical Phenomena</span> (1934), with theoretical elaborations by Harold Jeffreys. He illustrated his work with his own photography, for which he won awards at the St Louis Exposition in 1904 and the Franco-British Exhibition in London in 1908. He later collected his work in <span class="italic">The Photography of Scenery</span> (1946), with a companion volume of <span class="italic">Sketches of Scenery in England and Abroad</span> (1949). The aesthetic concerns which dominated his later career were already strong in his physical geographic research.<br>
<br>In 1907 and 1910 Cornish visited the construction site of the Panama Canal, which he described in <span class="italic">The Panama Canal and its Makers</span> (1909) as a spectacular landscape of engineering and which proved a key inspiration for his political and strategic geography. He promoted Britain's imperial mission and position in <span class="italic">Naval and Military Geography</span> (1916), <span class="italic">Imperial Military Geography</span> (1920), and <span class="italic">A Geography of Imperial Defence</span> (1922), and lectured to officers in wartime on the western front and at Scapa Flow, an experience recalled in <span class="italic">Geographical Essays</span> (1946). Cornish's imperial geography was also a racial geography, proposing the migration of &#145;British stock&#146; through the empire to safeguard the future of the &#145;white races&#146;. He argued for a geographical eugenics in the <span class="italic">Eugenics Review</span> (1925), asking &#145;which Nations are now the most useful part of the Human Community&#146;. Strategic concerns also informed his well-received historical geography of <span class="italic">The Great Capitals</span> (1923), which argued for the &#145;forward position&#146; of capital cities as a focal point of internal and foreign communications. His <span class="italic">Borderlands of Language in Europe</span> (1933) further argued that polyglot areas reflected periods when the &#145;Historic Frontier of Christendom&#146; had remained stationary. Cornish was president of the geographical section E of the British Association in 1923.<br>
<br>From around 1918 Cornish began to formulate an &#145;aesthetic geography&#146;, later citing Sir Francis Younghusband's 1920 address to the Royal Geographical Society on natural beauty and geographical science as a key inspiration. In his 1928 presidential address to the Geographical Association on harmonies of scenery  (<span class="italic">Geography</span>, 1928) he proposed a &#145;science of scenery&#146; which would enable the geographer to assess and advise on the beauty of landscape. <span class="italic">Nature</span> devoted an editorial to his work in March 1928. Cornish explored the workings of the eye in <span class="italic">Scenery and the Sense of Sight</span> (1935) and in reviews of landscape art exhibitions for <span class="italic">Nature</span> between 1929 and 1942. He termed himself a &#145;Pilgrim of Scenery&#146;, and his nature-mysticism received fullest expression in <span class="italic">The Poetic Impression of Natural Scenery</span> (1931) and <span class="italic">The Churchyard Yew and Immortality</span> (1946). His mystical and aesthetic geography extended the patriotic concerns of his imperial geography by presenting landscape as a key element of national identity, the &#145;proper&#146; experience of which would improve the citizen. Cornish was active in the Council for the Preservation of Rural England (CPRE), for whom he gave evidence to the national parks committee in 1929 and produced <span class="italic">The Scenery of England</span> (1932). He proposed national parks in <span class="italic">National Parks and the Heritage of Scenery</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">The Preservation of our Scenery</span> (1937), and put preservationist principles into practice after inheriting land in Salcombe Regis, Devon, in 1938, described in his CPRE pamphlet <span class="italic">The Farm upon the Cliff</span> (1939) and <span class="italic">The Scenery of Sidmouth</span> (1940). Cornish entered into agreements to preserve the cliff-top South Combe farm in perpetuity, and as owner of Thorn Farm erected a stone to explain the communal folk meaning of the Salcombe Regis thorn, discussed in his <span class="italic">Historic Thorn Trees in the British Isles</span> (1941).<br>
<br>Cornish was intensely proud of his family, minor gentry of the Sidmouth district of Devon since the fifteenth century. He regarded land as a source of family as well as national identity and was devoted to family history. He wrote the entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> for his elder brother, Charles, edited <span class="italic">Reminiscences of Country Life</span> (1939) by his brother the Revd James George Cornish, and published two works on family history, <span class="italic">A Family of Devon</span> (1942) and <span class="italic">Kestell, Clapp and Cornish</span> (1947). Cornish was somewhat austere yet courteous, and his reserve thawed when he discussed his lifelong interests. He died at the Willersley Nursing Home, Park Road, Camberley on 1 May 1948, and was buried alongside his first wife in Salcombe Regis churchyard.<br>
<br>Under the terms of his will of 4 August 1945 the Vaughan Cornish bequest was established at the University of Oxford to enable graduate students of the university to pursue studies &#145;relating to the beauty of scenery as determined by nature or the arts in town or country at home or abroad&#146;.<br>
