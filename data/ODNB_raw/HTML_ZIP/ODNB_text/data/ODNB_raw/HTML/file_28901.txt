</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Waugh,  Edwin</span>  (1817&#150;1890), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 29 January 1817 in a house adjoining the Clock Face inn, Toad Lane, Rochdale, Lancashire, the second son of Edward Waugh (1789&#150;1826), shoemaker, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Howarth, stonemason, and previously the wife of a man named Hawkward. His paternal forebears hailed from prosperous Northumbrian farming stock and his maternal ancestors were zealous Wesleyans and talented musicians. Waugh was taught to read Foxe's book of martyrs, Wesley's <span class="italic">Hymns</span>, and a compendium of English history by his mother. He attended school in Drake Street, Rochdale, from 1824, subsequently transferring to the national free school, and finally Davenport's Commercial School from 1828.<br>
<br>The death of his father in 1826, when Waugh was only nine years of age, reduced the family to a subsistence diet of milk and porridge in a Rochdale cellar dwelling. After assisting his mother selling boots in Rochdale market he earned his first wages running errands for a local Wesleyan printer. In 1831 he became an apprentice to Thomas Holden, another Rochdale printer and bookseller. This employment enabled him to develop his love of reading and introduced him to the folklorist John Roby and the antiquary Canon F. R. Raines, who became Waugh's mentor. After serving his apprenticeship he became a journeyman printer, chiefly in the provinces but also for six or seven years in London. He returned to Rochdale in 1844 and re-entered the service of Thomas Holden and played a prominent role in the establishment of a literary institute, editing for three months a manuscript magazine, <span class="italic">The Incentive</span>.<br>
<br>In 1847 Waugh was appointed assistant secretary to the Lancashire Public School Association, which had been recently founded in Manchester to campaign for a national system of unsectarian education. He remained with the association until 1852, during its period of most rapid growth. His new employment allowed him time to develop his literary skills, and he submitted prose accounts of rural rambles to the <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner and Times</span>. In 1855 a Manchester bookseller published his <span class="italic">Lancashire Sketches</span>, which included early examples of his dialect humour. During this period he was introduced by his colleague Frances Espinasse to a literary circle known as the Shandeans and subsequently became one of the founders of the Manchester Literary Club. Meanwhile, having failed to secure appointment as sub-librarian of the Manchester free libraries, he became a commercial traveller for a Manchester printing firm.<br>
<br>His new literary pursuits and his work in Manchester, however, imposed a considerable strain on Waugh's marriage. He had married Mary Ann Hill on 11 May 1847, shortly before commencing work in Manchester, and she had borne three children. However, they had little in common, and some of the difficulties within the relationship are revealed in an unpublished diary which Waugh kept after his marriage. He was intolerant of her illiteracy, her lack of interest in self-improvement, and &#145;that repulsive coarseness of deportment which she puts on so frequently to the utter damnation of all that is attractive in her appearance and disposition&#146; and they often brawled in public  (Vicinus, 15). Waugh was impetuous by nature, with a reputation as a womanizer. He had fathered a son, for whom he continued to pay maintenance, before their marriage, and about 1850, after Mary Ann had returned to Rochdale, he appears to have taken up with a female barber, variously described as &#145;a female whiskerando&#146; and &#145;a mad shaver&#146;  (ibid., 14). By 1856 he had separated from Mary Ann and moved in with a well-to-do Irish widow, Mrs Moorhouse, in Strangeways.<br>
<br>Ironically, during this period of marital upheaval Waugh became known to a wider public for his celebration of family relationships in his dialect poetry and songs. His best known song, &#145;Come whoam to the childer an' me&#146;, initially published in a Manchester newspaper in 1856, ultimately sold more copies than any previously published song. Its commendation of marital faithfulness and its sentimentality appealed to contemporary Victorian society. The <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> pronounced it &#145;one of the most delicious idylls in the world&#146;  (quoted in <span class="italic">Manchester Examiner and Times</span>) and the song, reprinted as a penny card, was soon being &#145;hummed all over Lancashire&#146;  (Hollingworth, 139). It was also actively promoted by the philanthropist and social reformer Angela Burdett-Coutts, who arranged for the free distribution of some 20,000 copies among the London poor, and in subsequent years was reprinted on calendars, in church bulletins, temperance pamphlets, anthologies, and other newspapers. One modern critic has concluded that &#145;in a very real sense this poem, with all its faults, put Lancashire dialect poetry on the map&#146;  (ibid., 138). Its astonishing success led to the publication of Waugh's <span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span> in 1859 and enabled him to become a full-time professional writer in 1860.<br>
<br>Waugh subsequently published a wide range of dialect songs, tales, and character sketches illustrative of Lancashire life, and also produced accounts of his travels in the Lake District, Scotland, Ireland, and even the Rhineland. His most impressive commissioned work comprised a series of newspaper articles on the impact of the Lancashire cotton famine of 1862. He demonstrated an acute empathetic understanding of poverty and hardship, but has been criticized for his failure to probe complex issues such as unemployment and working conditions in factories and for his lack of sympathy for Chartism and the political aspirations of the working classes. His writing appeared at a time of transition, when the survival of dialect was threatened by the impact of the 1870 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. His inspiration was drawn from the smaller Lancashire manufacturing towns and villages on the Yorkshire border, where dialect speech was more pronounced than in the big cities. &#145;The past, and still more the disappearing present, of this important district&#146;, he wrote, &#145;teem with significant features, which, if caught up and truthfully represented, might perhaps, be useful to the next generation&#146;  (Vicinus, 22). Between 1881 and 1883 he published a collective illustrated edition of his works in ten volumes, to which an eleventh volume, containing a second series of poems and songs, was added in 1889. He was often referred to as the Lancashire Burns or the Laureate of Lancashire and praised for his &#145;wonderful command of native vigorous idiom&#146;, his insights into character, and his representation of &#145;the pathos of human life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>). His most popular character was Besom Ben, a broom maker living in contentment on the moors of north Lancashire, &#145;whose wants were simple and his cares were few&#146;  (Vicinus, 39).<br>
<br>To supplement his income Waugh also gave public readings from his works and gained a reputation as a jovial raconteur. He also enjoyed singing traditional and patriotic songs in his distinctive tenor voice; indeed, his friend Ben Brierley maintained that he &#145;could sing a song as sweetly as any man I have listened to&#146;  (Brierley, 9). Photographs and sketches reveal an extrovert personality. He possessed a full head of wavy hair and neatly trimmed beard into old age, and usually sported a bow-tie, jacket, and waistcoat, and one of the many walking sticks from his vast collection. Athletic in his youth, when he had enjoyed racing and wrestling, he remained a keen rambler until his health began to fail in the 1870s. In 1881 Gladstone conferred upon Waugh a civil-list pension of &pound;90 per annum, and in 1887 he was presented with a silver-mounted walking stick, gold pen, and silver pencil case by his friends on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. After undergoing two operations for cancer of the tongue he retired to the coast to convalesce at New Brighton, near Liverpool. He died on 30 April 1890 at his home, The Hollies, Percy Street, Liscard, Cheshire. His body was brought back to Manchester for burial, and thousands followed the cort&egrave;ge through the city, where flags flew at half mast, to St Paul's Church, near his former home on Kersal Moor, where he was buried on 3 May. A contemporary obituary writer in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> observed that Lancashire had demonstrated &#145;a peculiar affection for the poet and story-teller who spoke its language and expressed its mind with such fidelity&#146;. Professor Martha Vicinus, writing almost a century after his death, pronounced him the &#145;leading literary spokesman for the working class of mid-nineteenth-century Lancashire&#146;  (Vicinus, 44).<br>
