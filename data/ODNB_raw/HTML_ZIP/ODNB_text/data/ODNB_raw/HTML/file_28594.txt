<span class="headword">Walpole,  Henry</span> <span class="st"> [St Henry Walpole]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1558, <em>d.</em> 1595), <span class="occ">Jesuit and martyr</span>, was baptized in October 1558 in Docking, Norfolk, the eldest of the ten children of Christopher Walpole (<i>d</i>. 1596), gentleman, and his wife, Margery Warner, daughter of Richard and Alice Beckham of Narford. The Walpole family had lived in Norfolk for at least 600 years. At the end of Queen Mary's reign Henry's father settled at Docking Hall. Upon the increase of the family he acquired Anmer Hall, with a large estate in Anmer and Dersingham, in 1575. This estate was contiguous to his cousin's estate at Houghton and his nephew's estate at Herpley. The three estates covered 50 square miles. His brother John Walpole of Herpley was a serjeant-at-law.<br>
<br>Christopher and John Walpole both sent their sons to the grammar school in Norwich which Edward Coke, the future chief justice of the common pleas, had also attended. Henry Walpole probably entered the school in 1566 or 1567, when his master was Stephen Limpert. In 1575 he matriculated at Cambridge and entered Peterhouse to study philosophy, and spent four years in learning languages. He took an interest in religious controversy, &#145;which piece of curiosity &hellip; ended in his conversion to the Catholick faith&#146;  (Dodd, 148). Henry More, however, says that Walpole was &#145;nurtured from childhood in Catholic tenets&#146;, and that when he was older, &#145;he gave such example of discretion and good sense that he could take the place of parents for his brothers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Elizabethan Jesuits</span>, 254). Meanwhile John Walpole had entrusted the education of his son William to Thomas Thirlby, bishop of Ely, who was sent to the Tower of London in 1560. At the time Henry Walpole entered Peterhouse another young man of similar background, Dudley Fenner, also entered. Jessopp says that Fenner was &#145;a rigid and fervent Puritan; Walpole, as earnest and devoted a Catholic&#146;  (Jessopp, 75). Both were driven into exile and to exercise their ministries in Belgium, one as a puritan preacher, the other as a Jesuit priest. In 1576 Henry's cousin Edward also matriculated at Peterhouse. Along with him came four recusant neighbours&#151;Edward Yelverton of Rougham, John Cobbe of Sandringham, Philip Paris of Pudding Norton, and Bernard Gardiner of Coxford Abbey. Neither Henry nor Edward Walpole proceeded to a degree, presumably because of the oath required. Henry's name appears in the buttery books of Peterhouse for the last time on 17 April 1579. He was also a student at Gray's Inn in 1578, following in his father's and uncle's footsteps. Jessopp notes that &#145;Gray's Inn was at this time a favourite haunt of all who were &#147;Catholicly&#148; inclined&#146;  (ibid., 127).<br>
<br>It was not long after this that the course of Walpole's life was to change dramatically. It all began with a group of fourteen leaving Rome for England on 18 April 1580. This group was led initially by Thomas Goldwell, Marian bishop of St Asaph and the last surviving bishop of the old hierarchy, and Laurence Vaux, last warden of the collegiate church of Manchester. It was decided at St Omer that Goldwell, who was nearing eighty, and some other priests, were too old to withstand the dangers of going to England. In the end Robert Persons, Edmund Campion, and the others entered England in small groups. It was Henry Walpole's attendance at Campion's execution at Tyburn on 1 December 1581 that changed his life. Some blood from the martyr splashed onto Walpole, who had earlier attended Campion's disputation in the Tower of London, and also his trial. Walpole accepted this as a call to take up the work of Campion. He immediately wrote a poem entitled &#145;An Epitaph of the Life and Death of &hellip; Edmund Campion&#146;. There was a huge demand for the manuscript. Some extracts read:<blockquote>
<div>our new apostle cumyng to restore<br>
</div>
<div>the faith, wich Austen planted here before &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>they thought it best to take hys lyfe awaye,<br>
</div>
<div>because they sawe he wuld theire matter marre &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>All Europe wonders at so rare a man.<br>
</div> (Jessopp, 133&#150;7)</blockquote>The government made successful efforts to track down and destroy copies of this poem. It was not long before Walpole was suspected of being the author: he was already under suspicion of converting over twenty young men to his faith. Valenger, one of Walpole's friends, on whose private press it was printed, was brought before the council, and was condemned to lose his ears. Walpole considered it expedient to slip away to Norfolk and was concealed in a hiding place at Anmer Hall. In this he must have had the support of his family. On leaving Anmer Hall <i>en route</i> for the continent he concealed himself in the woods by day and eventually arrived at Newcastle, where he took ship for France. He went to Rouen and Paris and arrived on 7 July 1582 at the English College, Rheims, where he was enrolled as a theological student. He remained about ten months, and was then accepted by the English College, Rome, on 28 April 1583. In 1584 he applied for admission to the Jesuit order and completed two years' probation at Verdun. He became prefect of the convictors at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson and was ordained priest in Paris on 17 December 1588. Later he served as a chaplain in Colonel William Stanley's regiment in the Netherlands. In the meantime his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28599/', "Richard Walpole")</script> spent three years at Peterhouse, and then followed his elder brother to the English College, Rome, in 1584. Richard was ordained as a Jesuit priest in 1589. Likewise another two of Henry's brothers, Christopher and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28597/', "Michael Walpole")</script>, and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28592/', "Edward Walpole")</script>, became Jesuit priests.<br>
<br>To Walpole's five brothers sitting round their hearth at Anmer Hall in the winter of 1589 came the news that he had been arrested in Flushing when it was captured by English troops. One of the English officers, Captain Russels of West Rudham, a cousin of the Walpoles, got word back to Norfolk. Michael Walpole immediately set out for Flushing, paid the ransom, and procured Henry's release in January 1590. For most of the next two years Henry Walpole exercised his priestly functions on the continent. He met there many old friends and all his brothers, except Geoffrey, who had all left England during this unsettled period. At this time Walpole was at the Jesuit college at Tournai. Meanwhile the government was so concerned about the growth of the overseas seminaries and the activities of their alumni that in November 1591 the queen published her famous edict denouncing them. Persons immediately composed his <span class="italic">Responsio ad edictum</span> in reply in Latin, under the name of Philopater. An English version was considered advisable, and Henry Walpole was entrusted with the task. This reply was aimed at showing that it was not the queen who was responsible for the edict and repressive measures against the seminary priests, but her council, Cecil in particular. A spy forwarded a copy of Walpole's translation to the council, and his ultimate fate was then sealed. Walpole was working on the translation when he was summoned to join Persons in Spain. He attended the opening of the chapel of the new Jesuit college in Seville in December 1592, where he met his brother Richard for the first time in years. After two months in Seville, Henry was sent to Valladolid, where he held the post of minister at St Alban's College.<br>
<br>Persons told Walpole in June 1593 that it had been decided to send him on the English mission; Walpole had for some time wished to emulate the successful mission of the Jesuit John Gerard in East Anglia. Before leaving he was presented to Philip II at the Escorial. He sailed from Bilbao to Calais and then went to Douai. He joined his brother Thomas and Edward Lingen, both former officers of Sir William Stanley's English regiment. They had to wait some weeks at St Omer, awaiting a ship to England. At last arrangements were made for passage to Essex, Suffolk, or Norfolk. But the weather on the voyage in early December 1593 was so bad that Walpole's party had to land at Bridlington, Yorkshire. One of Walsingham's spies had previously disembarked from an accompanying vessel, and he went to warn the authorities in York. Ignorant of Yorkshire, and without a map, they committed the blunder of keeping together. At this time Yorkshire was under the iron grip of the president of the council of the north, Henry, earl of Huntingdon, and the party was soon apprehended at Kilham on 7 December and confined at York Castle.<br>
<br>Upon questioning Walpole admitted to being a Jesuit priest, but neither he nor Lingen would incriminate others. Thomas Walpole, however, admitted all he knew, even to revealing where his brother had buried a packet of letters on landing. On 25 January 1594 Richard Topcliffe wrote to Lord Keeper Puckering: &#145;Much more lies hidden in the Jesuit and Lingen, which cannot be digged out without further authority than his Lordship has &hellip; They must be dealt with sharply, and more will burst out&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1591&#150;4</i>, 417). Several conferences with protestant clergy were arranged, on which occasions Walpole &#145;discovered both his zeal and learning, which were far above the commonest&#146;. The earl of Huntingdon wrote to Lord Burghley on 23 February 1594: &#145;the Jesuit Walpole and his brother shal be sent towards London &hellip;, and before they goe I will examine them bothe again &hellip; But I think Mr. Topcliffe had all with him&#146;  (Pollen, 240). On the day Walpole was sent to London, he was placed in Topcliffe's custody. It was then that his sufferings really began. He was committed to the Tower of London where there were a number of other notable recusant prisoners, including Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, and Robert Southwell. He was placed in solitary confinement for nearly two months, and on 27 April he underwent his first examination before Serjeant Drewe, Sir Edward Coke, and Topcliffe. Official records indicate the many questions and answers during the six examinations between then and 17 June 1594. So far Walpole had only disclosed facts the examiners already knew. In June he revealed a conversation with Persons on the lawfulness of assassinating the queen, when Persons had stated &#145;that Catholics &hellip; ought to suffer violence, but offer none, chiefly to princes&#146;  (Jessopp, 284). He was then put on the rack many times, and gradually gave more valuable information on the seminaries in Spain and the names of the students. One thing he did not do was to compromise anyone in England whose life would have been in peril as the result of revelations. But, as Jessopp points out, there were worse ordeals to come: in July 1594 he was able to write, but, after being left with Topcliffe for a further nine months, his writing had become an illegible scrawl.<br>
<br>By the spring of 1595 Walpole was sent to York for trial. One of his judges was Francis Beaumont, a fellow former commoner of Peterhouse. The indictment contained three counts: that Walpole had abjured the realm without licence; that he had received holy orders overseas; and that he had returned to England as a Jesuit priest to exercise his priestly functions. According to the relevant statute, to so return was to be guilty of high treason. Walpole's own confessions, extracted under torture, were read to the court, and the jury was asked to pronounce its verdict on this evidence. The judge refused to hear Walpole in his defence, apart from a brief statement. Despite this, Walpole acquitted himself with great ability, as befitted a one-time student of Gray's Inn. The judge ordered the jury to find him guilty. While awaiting sentence Walpole managed to write to his father and friends. One of these letters was addressed to a fellow Jesuit, Richard Holtby. Jessopp quotes a letter from Holtby, then in the archives of Stonyhurst College, giving an account of Walpole's final hours. Another conference with protestant clergy was arranged in the days before he died.<br>
<br>Walpole's execution in York occurred on 17 April 1595. When the day dawned, Walpole was dragged to the place of execution on a hurdle. Once again he testified his loyalty to the queen, so that some tried to persuade the magistrate to stop the execution. On the scaffold he was pushed and hanged before he could complete his prayers. He was immediately drawn and quartered.<br>
<br>His father died broken-hearted in 1596, fifteen months after Walpole's execution. The Norfolk property was divided between Geoffrey and Thomas Walpole. Thomas took Anmer Hall: both he and his wife, Thomasine, were listed as Norfolk recusants in 1615. His cousin Calibut Walpole died in 1646, just thirty years before his lineal descendant Sir Robert Walpole, England's first prime minister, was born, and the fortunes of the house of Walpole rose again. A portrait of Henry Walpole is one of sixteen martyr portraits at St Alban's College, Valladolid. A copy was made for Frederick Walpole of Mannington Hall, Norfolk. In 1970 Henry Walpole was canonized by Pope Paul VI as one of the forty martyrs of England and Wales. His feast day is observed on 25 October.<br>
