<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vicious,  Sid</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Simon John Beverley; <em>formerly </em>Simon John Ritchie]</span>  (1957&#150;1979), <span class="occ">rock musician</span>, was born on 10 May 1957 at Lewisham Hospital, London, the only child of John George Ritchie, a publisher's representative, and his wife, Anne Jeannette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDonald. His parents divorced, and his mother then married Chris Beverley; after the death of her second husband Anne retained his surname, as did her son.<br>
<br>Simon Beverley's childhood was dominated by frequent house moves around London, prompted by his mother's unstable personality. Poverty was a constant problem, but adversity strengthened their relationship. Acquaintances likened them to co-conspirators rather than parent and child. By his teenage years Simon was borrowing his mother's syringe to take amphetamine sulphate (&#145;speed&#146;). His heavily disrupted secondary education ended at a special-needs school in Stoke Newington when he was fifteen. A job in a textile factory followed, before he enrolled at Hackney technical college in 1973 to take a course in photography. He was a fan of David Bowie, whom he emulated by dressing in an outlandish manner. The look drew him closer to his fellow student and old school friend John Lydon, and they lived together in various squats in London. The nickname Sid originated from this time, in homage to Lydon's pet hamster. Money was scarce, prompting Beverley to dabble in prostitution as a rent boy.<br>
<br>In 1976 Beverley became a leading figure in the punk rock scene that developed in London under the influence of Malcolm McLaren, proprietor of the clothes shop Sex in the King's Road, Chelsea. The pre-eminent punk band was the Sex Pistols, formed by McLaren in 1975 from customers of his shop; Lydon&#151;renamed Johnny Rotten&#151;was the group's lead singer. Punk music was basically structured and roughly produced, with lyrics detailing society's ills (rather than the traditional theme of love) and sung in an angry, shouting manner. Unable to play any musical instruments, Beverley became the group's most notorious fan and invented the &#145;pogo&#146; dance&#151;so-called because it involved jumping up and down. Encouraged by McLaren's desire for publicity, he called himself Sid Vicious and lived up to the name. At a Sex Pistols show in April 1976 he attacked a music journalist with a bicycle chain. In September he threw a glass during a concert and injured several people. He was subsequently found guilty of possessing an illegal weapon (a knife) and sentenced to a short spell at Ashford remand centre.<br>
<br>Sid Vicious's lasting imprisonment, however, was his new name: the na&iuml;ve, fashion-obsessed teenager had assumed a new identity. The image consisted of spiked black hair, a snarling upper lip, and torn clothes held together by safety pins and &#145;bondage&#146; straps. He also wore swastika T-shirts and armbands. The context for this deployment of Nazi insignia was mounting racial tension in Britain, exacerbated by rising unemployment. Vicious, however, was apathetic about politics: his aim was simply to shock. He was led by the clothes available in McLaren's shop, which in turn had been influenced by the popularity of the film <span class="italic">Cabaret</span> (1972). The film's depiction of Weimar decadence seemed apposite to disaffected youth during Britain's own crisis of governability in the mid-1970s. This <i>Zeitgeist</i> was subsequently captured by the Sex Pistols' first single, &#145;Anarchy in the UK&#146;, released in November 1976.<br>
<br>Punk's do-it-yourself ethic and contempt for traditional notions of musicianship encouraged Vicious to try to learn bass guitar. He played along to the first album by the Ramones but found even their three-chord structures difficult to master. His stage d&eacute;but was as a drummer for Suzie (later Siouxsie) and the Banshees on 20 September 1976. The performance consisted of a twenty-minute version of the Lord's prayer; they had rehearsed only once, as the intention was to make as horrible a racket as possible. That autumn he practised with a pool of punk musicians calling themselves the Flowers of Romance. He also tried writing lyrics. The results were either doom-laden or simply offensive&#151;as in &#145;Belsen was a gas&#146;.<br>
<br>In February 1977 a split occurred between the main songwriters in the Sex Pistols. Rotten, the lyricist, disliked the melodic inclinations of the bass guitarist, Glen Matlock, and so replaced him with Sid Vicious. During the course of the next year Vicious lived out punk's nihilistic inner core to the full but the band's output of new songs dried up; subsequent releases had mainly been written and recorded during the Matlock era. With pop stardom came groupies. Vicious was pursued by Nancy Spungen (1958&#150;1978), daughter of a Philadelphia businessman, who came to Britain in early 1977. The two became inseparable, in large part because she introduced him to heroin. The relationship alienated Vicious from the other members of the band. None of them visited him when he was in hospital with hepatitis in April and May of that year.<br>
<br>The peak of the Sex Pistols' notoriety came in June 1977 with the release of &#145;God Save the Queen&#146;, timed to coincide with Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Originally entitled &#145;No future&#146; (after its refrain), the song equated deference to Britain's ruling institutions with being moronic. It reached number two in the charts and would have been number one but for the machinations of an embarrassed music industry. A chart-topping album, <span class="italic">Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols</span>, came out in October. Vicious helped to write two of the album's twelve tracks (&#145;Holidays in the sun&#146; and &#145;Bodies&#146;) but his rudimentary bass contributions were overdubbed by other members of the band. Nevertheless, his surly swagger in film footage from jubilee week helped define the group&#151;and that summer&#151;for posterity.<br>
<br>The band's notoriety made it difficult for them to play live dates, but Vicious relished the attention when they did (even though his guitar was usually unplugged from the amplifiers). Off stage his heroin addiction made him increasingly difficult to handle; it also made him a liability when the band toured America in January 1978. During shows he gashed himself to draw blood and in Texas he clubbed a member of the audience with his instrument, nearly causing a riot. At the end of the tour (17 January) Rotten left the band and Vicious became the Sex Pistols' front man. McLaren, meanwhile, was preoccupied with documenting the creation of the band on celluloid. The fictionalized account, <span class="italic">The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle</span>, was filmed mainly in 1978. Vicious sang three cover songs, Eddie Cochran's &#145;Something else&#146; and &#145;C'mon everybody&#146;, plus Sinatra's &#145;My way&#146; (a top ten single in June 1978). He also resurrected his own compositions.<br>
<br>Heroin abuse, meanwhile, began to take its toll. In August 1978 Vicious was jolted when a friend died of an overdose while sharing a bed with himself and Spungen&#151;it was hours before they realized that he was dead. A month later the pair flew to New York to make a fresh start. They stayed at the Chelsea Hotel on West 23rd Street, a renowned residence for artists. To earn money, Vicious performed at local venues. On the morning of 11 October he woke to find Spungen dead in the bathroom with a knife wound to the stomach. He was arrested and, while in a confused state, admitted to stabbing her. Bail of $50,000 was put up by his record label on the 17th, allowing for his release. On 22 October he was admitted to Bellevue Hospital after a suicide attempt. After being discharged a few days later, he acquired a new girlfriend, Michelle Robinson. A nightclub fight in December resulted in his returning to custody until 1 February 1979. His mother flew to America on his release and they stayed the night with Robinson at her Greenwich Village apartment. In the early hours of 2 February, while the others were sleeping, Vicious took some heroin from his mother's purse and injected himself with what proved to be a lethal dose. He was cremated in New York on 7 February. His mother later scattered the ashes over Spungen's grave at the King David cemetery in Bensalem, Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Sid Vicious's death at twenty-one was worldwide news and instantly elevated him to the &#145;live fast, die young&#146; hall of fame. Iconic status was ensured. At the Sex Pistols' peak, elements of the establishment regarded the band as a treasonous threat&#151;best seen in Julian Temple's documentary film <span class="italic">The Filth and the Fury</span> (2000). But even then Vicious's contribution owed more to the fantasy of rock martyrdom than to any serious questioning of society's values. His drawn-out drug-induced demise turned punk rebellion into a revolt against the self. By 1979 punk was just another product and his death prompted one last surge of hype. The soundtrack to the <span class="italic">Swindle</span> film was rush-released that same month, though its cinema opening did not occur until May 1980. A single, &#145;Something else&#146;, came out at the end of February and sold nearly twice as many copies as &#145;God Save the Queen&#146;, but when the record company released the live album <span class="italic">Sid Sings</span> in December, few bought it. Vicious's obsessive relationship with Spungen proved a more enduring story and was the subject of the feature film <span class="italic">Sid and Nancy</span> (1986).<br>
