</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wheatley,  John Thomas</span>, Baron Wheatley  (1908&#150;1988), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, was born on 17 January 1908 at 231 Main Street, Shettleston, Glasgow, the third and youngest child of Patrick Wheatley (1875&#150;1937), sometime miner and later publisher, who was born in co. Waterford, and his wife, Janet (1877&#150;1951), a pupil teacher and daughter of Peter Murphy, a labourer who was born in Belfast. The families of both his parents had come to Scotland from Ireland seeking employment. His father was eventually in business as a newspaper proprietor. Wheatley was educated at St Mark's School, Carntyne, St Aloysius College, Glasgow, and the Jesuit boarding-school Mount St Mary's College, Sheffield. He attended Glasgow University, where he graduated MA (1928) and LLB (1930). He served a legal apprenticeship in Glasgow, and in 1932 passed advocate after devilling to John Cameron.<br>
<br>In Glasgow on 5 August 1935 Wheatley married Agnes Nancy (1906&#150;1995), daughter of Samuel Nichol, a joiner from Selkirk then living in Glasgow. Both families were supporters of the labour movement, and from his earliest days Wheatley was active in politics. In his autobiography he states that, when aged eight, he was given honorary membership of the Shettleston Independent Labour Party (ILP), to which he had been introduced by his uncle, also John Wheatley, later a member of parliament and minister of health in the first Labour administration in 1924. From his schooldays Wheatley was drawn to the law, and it was his ambition to become an advocate. He had been born into a Catholic family, and so it was that throughout his life, he felt strongly about three things: religion, politics, and the law.<br>
<br>Between 1932 and 1939 Wheatley practised as an advocate at the Scottish bar. His was a general practice covering reparation, divorce, and crime. His reparation work was mainly for pursuers. When war broke out in 1939 Wheatley supported the war, and resigned from the ILP, which was a pacifist organization, to join the Labour Party. In those days appointments of prosecuting counsel (advocates-depute) were made on a political basis by the lord advocate of the day, and when the Churchill government was formed in 1940, Wheatley became sheriff court advocate-depute, so beginning a long connection with the crown office. In 1941 he was called up for army service in the Royal Artillery. It was a tradition during wartime that members of the Faculty of Advocates on leave could appear in court in uniform without wig and gown. Before he was commissioned, and while still a lance-bombardier, Wheatley made history as the first non-commissioned officer to appear in court in uniform without wig and gown. He was very proud of having this distinction. During the latter part of his war service he served in the judge advocate-general's department.<br>
<br>While still in uniform Wheatley was adopted as Labour candidate for North Ayrshire and Bute. He fought in the general election of 1945 but was defeated, and under the Labour government became an advocate-depute. This was a part-time salaried appointment, and he continued his practice in the civil courts. In 1946 he lost the Bridgeton by-election for Labour, but in March 1947 he was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland, and later that year he became lord advocate at the early age of thirty-nine. At the by-election caused by the resignation of George Thomson, the previous lord advocate, who had become lord justice clerk, Wheatley became member of parliament for East Edinburgh, a seat he held until his own elevation to the bench seven years later.<br>
<br>As a member of the government from 1947 to 1951 Wheatley was involved in much of the legislation concerning nationalization and the welfare state. As regards Scotland, he was closely involved in legislation which introduced legal aid and advice, and established the Law Society of Scotland. In 1954, with a Conservative government in power, he was appointed to the bench as a senator of the college of justice at the relatively early age of forty-six. In 1972, with another Conservative government in office, he became lord justice clerk. He continued to hold this office until 1985, by which time he was seventy-seven, having been appointed before the introduction of a compulsory retiring age for judges of seventy.<br>
<br>Although not one of the great judges of the twentieth century, Wheatley was a distinguished judge who served Scotland well. He had a sound knowledge of the law, and a strong desire to do justice. Sitting on his own in the outer house or presiding at a trial, he was not an easy judge to appear before because he tended to have preconceived ideas about any case he was hearing; being a strong character, he consciously or subconsciously tried to impose his own views on counsel in the case. However, he was prepared to change these views when addressed by a counsel who was persistent and persuasive. The judgments he delivered were always clear, if at times somewhat wordy.<br>
<br>It was during his thirteen years as lord justice clerk that Wheatley had his greatest influence on the law of Scotland. Again it must be said that the second division of the Court of Session over which he presided was not always a pleasant court in which to appear as counsel. He and his colleagues were not good listeners and interrupted constantly. In the criminal appeal court Wheatley was not comfortable in delivering extempore judgments on the bench; this had the unfortunate consequence that no reason was given for some decisions on appeals which, through pressure of work, had to be disposed of instantaneously. But the court led by Wheatley issued many important decisions, the fairness and soundness of which were never in doubt. As lord justice clerk he had a special part to play in the criminal field, and his guidelines on granting bail are still followed nearly twenty years after being promulgated. He also set the tone in sentencing. Other judgments by him are often cited in the courts.<br>
<br>Outside the law Wheatley gave notable service to his community. He was chairman both of an inquiry into teaching in Scotland from 1961 to 1963, and of the royal commission of local government in Scotland from 1966 to 1969. In 1970 he was given a life peerage and became Baron Wheatley of Shettleston. In 1971 he conducted an inquiry into crowd safety at sports grounds. He served on many voluntary organizations, including the NSPCC and Age Concern. He was the first chairman of court of Stirling University. He received honorary degrees from Glasgow and Stirling universities.<br>
<br>Wheatley died from cancer on 28 July 1988 at his home, 3 Greenhill Gardens, Edinburgh. In his latter days he was one of the best-known public figures in Scotland, recognized for his religious faith, for his past service in politics, and as a leading judge who was never slow to speak his mind. He published his autobiography in 1987. He was proud of his four sons, his daughter, and his grandchildren. Off the bench he was unpretentious, and despite being a total abstainer, very convivial. He was also a big-hearted man, and he, more than anyone, would have regretted the fact that by attending the Roman Catholic service at Wheatley's funeral in 1988, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the lord chancellor, was excommunicated by the Free Presbyterian church.<br>
