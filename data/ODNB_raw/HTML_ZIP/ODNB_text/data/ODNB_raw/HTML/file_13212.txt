<span class="headword">Hickman,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1629, <em>d.</em> 1692), <span class="occ">clergyman, ejected minister and religious controversialist</span>, was baptized on 19 January 1629 at Old Swinford, Worcestershire, the son of Richard Hickman (<i>d</i>. 1656/7), a clothier, and his wife, Rose, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Male. With substantial assistance from his uncle Henry Hickman, a salter of London, he was educated at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1648. Hickman then entered Magdalen College, Oxford, becoming a demy on 29 October 1648. On 5 March 1649 he was admitted as a fellow by the parliamentary visitors; on 14 March 1650 he was incorporated BA and proceeded MA the same day. Licensed as a preacher, he was lecturer at Brackley, Northamptonshire, by the time he arrived at Steane about 1650 or 1651 to teach logic to Nathaniel Crewe, later Baron Crewe of Steane and bishop of Durham.<br>
<br>Hickman was friendly with John Spilsbury, also a fellow of Magdalen, vicar of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire from 1654 to 1660, and with Richard Baxter. On 12 September 1653 Hickman was appointed vicar of Brackley; on 7 January 1654 he wrote to Baxter that &#145;I have withdrawn myself from the university&#146; to officiate there, and that he did not intend to involve himself in the controversies which Baxter's works were stimulating  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.122&#150;3). He was, however, unable to suppress his taste for theological battle. In a university disputation of 1657, having obtained Baxter's advice on the validity of Catholic ordination, Hickman argued that &#145;the Church of Rome, for aught he knew, was a true church&#146;; this did not find favour with Vavasor Powel, who at All Saints, Oxford, on 15 July 1657, riposted that &#145;the Pope would provide him with a mitre and the Devil with a frying-pan&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>). In May 1657 Hickman was invited to become pastor of Stoke Newington but he declined in the hope of a benefice close to his college; he was admitted rector of St Aldates, Oxford, on 29 July 1657, and proceeded BD on 29 May 1658. On 20 July 1659 Hickman wrote thanking Baxter for his book, probably <span class="italic">The Holy Commonwealth</span>, remarking that he could not tell whether most to admire his &#145;judgement or your courage&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.401). Baxter wrote to William Mewe on 6 September 1659 that &#145;my friend&#146; Hickman was his only active ally in refuting their various opponents  (ibid., 1.407&#150;8).<br>
<br>Of Hickman's voluminous polemical writings, sometimes issued anonymously or under the pseudonym Theophilus Churchman, the exchanges with Thomas Pierce and Peter Heylin are perhaps most notable. In the first preface to Pierce's <span class="italic">An Impartial Inquiry into the Nature of Sin</span> (1660) the author denounced Hickman as a brother in spirit of &#145;the rigid scotized thorow paced Presbyterians&#146;, accusing him of holding the heresy of some high Calvinists that God was the author of sin, and of thus &#145;laying the foundation of perfect Libertinism and Rantism&#146;. Hickman replied to Pierce in <span class="italic">A justification of the fathers and the schoolmen that they are not self condemned for denying the positivity of sin</span> (1659). In <span class="italic">Plus ultra</span> (1661) and other works he also challenged Peter Heylin's version of the history of English protestantism. He was outraged, for example, that Heylin should &#145;lay his pelagian eggs in the nest of our first reformers&#146;, and denounced as unreliable William Barlow's anti-puritan account of the Hampton Court conference of 1604 (<span class="italic">A Review of the Certamen epistolare</span>, 1659). Hickman also ill-advisedly questioned the legality of Heylin's marriage.<br>
<br>After the restoration of Charles II in 1660 Hickman lost his post at St Aldates and was ousted from his university fellowship on 6 August 1662. At a dinner with the diarist Samuel Pepys on 21 August 1662 he complained bitterly of the high-handed ejections initiated by vengeful returned Anglican fellows. Soon afterwards he crossed to the Netherlands and took refuge with Matthew Newcomen, the ejected lecturer of Dedham, acting as an assistant preacher in the English church at Leiden in 1664. A Henry Hickman appears under the date 13 July 1663 as a student of the University of Leiden. On 26 March 1666, however, his name featured on a list of English subjects whom the government sought to have returned to stand trial for their activities during the interregnum. Hickman did return, but seems not to have been dealt with severely. However, he quickly became involved in a long and labyrinthine struggle in the court of chancery against Alice Hickman, over the estate of her husband Henry, his uncle and former benefactor. In 1666&#150;7 Hickman became a tutor in the house of William Strode, of Barrington, Somerset, a presbyterian and former MP, with a salary of &pound;10 a year &#145;and his diet&#146;  (Reade, <span class="italic">Gleanings</span>, 55). Strode died in December 1666, leaving &pound;2500 and an additional &pound;1000 due on a mortgage to his daughter Joanna. On 30 November 1667 Hickman, then of St James's, Clerkenwell, was licensed to marry Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1692), who was then aged twenty-six; this presaged the launch of another lawsuit. On 24 November 1668 the couple filed a petition in chancery against her brothers for claims under her father's will. In response William Strode alleged that after his father's death Joanna and Henry had removed gold and other valuable property from the house, and he further accused Hickman of secretly marrying Joanna to get her fortune. It was probably after his marriage that Hickman opened a school at Dusthorp, near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to which Oliver Heywood and Adam Martindale sent their sons. He probably lived at the nearby parish of Belbroughton (where John Tristram, his sister's husband, was the patron); he baptized a son, William, there on 28 October 1668. Probably about this time he founded a library at Stourbridge grammar school.<br>
<br>Hickman returned to the Netherlands in 1674 and became pastor of the English church at Leiden. Here it was expected that he would place himself under the discipline of the Dutch classis, but &#145;no action was taken because Hickman could not understand the Dutch language, and it was decided to wait &#147;until Hickman understands Dutch better&#148;&#146;  (Sprunger, 416). On 18 April 1675, as pastor of the English church in the city, he was admitted to study medicine at Leiden University. On 19 March 1683, at the office of the public notary in Leiden, Henry and Joanna Hickman willed that most of their estate should pass to their children, making special arrangements for property in Warwickshire and for Hickman's library. They both died in Leiden in 1692, Henry about Michaelmas, and Joanna a few weeks later. On 10 March 1693 the prerogative court of Canterbury granted the administration of their estate to their son William, who the following week made his own will before returning to the Netherlands.<br>
