<span class="headword">Fairfax,  Brian</span>  (1633&#150;1711), <span class="occ">scholar and courtier</span>, was born on 6 October 1633 in the rectory at Newton Kyme in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the third and second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9084/', "Henry Fairfax (1588&#150;1665)")</script>, the rector, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1593&#150;1650), daughter of Sir Henry Cholmley of Whitby and Roxby and his wife, Margaret. He was educated at Coxwold School from about 1644 to 1647 and was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on 8 April 1648. He graduated BA in 1652, proceeded MA in 1655, and was admitted to Gray's Inn on 10 May 1654. He attended the marriage of Mary Fairfax, daughter of his cousin, the third Baron Fairfax, to the duke of Buckingham on 15 September 1657. When Cromwell imprisoned Buckingham in the Tower, Brian accompanied Lord Fairfax to Whitehall to demand his release. Shortly after, Lord Fairfax sent him to France with the earl of Kildare and his return to England the following year was delayed by a scuffle with a privateer in the channel. On 20 December 1659 he went to Nun Appleton to visit Lord Fairfax, who entrusted him with delivering the verbal message to General George Monck in Scotland that Fairfax would appear in arms on 1 January 1660. He started out on 21 December, disguised by Buckingham as a &#145;young country clown&#146;  (Bell, 2.154), and travelled unarmed save for a swordstick supplied by his brother. Having fended off an attack from a moss-trooper, he reached Monck at Coldstream near midnight on 25 December. He returned to find Fairfax raising the Yorkshire gentry on 1 January. On 6 January he was sent to London with a letter to Speaker Lenthall, and he returned to witness Monck's interview with Fairfax at Nun Appleton. On 18 May 1660 he accompanied the parliamentary commission led by Lord Fairfax to The Hague to invite Charles II's return. Having been called to the bar in 1661, he became Lord Fairfax's private secretary; he warned him of the northern risings conspiracy of 1663 and later attended him in his dying days.<br>
<br>Fairfax served with Buckingham aboard <i>The Prince</i> during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and on 21 January 1670 he was appointed equerry to Charles II. He accompanied Buckingham on embassies to the Netherlands and France in 1673, and on 22 April 1675 he married at Westminster Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1709), daughter of Sir Edmund Carey. The couple settled at Westminster, residing in a &#145;little pritty house in the Mews, as private as a colledg&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of Robert Fairfax</span>, 145). Their third son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9079/', "Charles Brandon Fairfax")</script> became dean of Down. Fairfax was created DCL at Oxford in 1677. With the king's death on 6 February 1685 he resigned his post of equerry, later reflecting: &#145;I left Whit-hall when the Mass came into it, I saw a new King who would not know me nor did I desire to wayte on him&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>With the death of Buckingham two years later, on 16 April 1687, Fairfax also lost his patron, of whom he warned his sons: &#145;I came to be related to the duke of Buckingham as a servant and kinsman, and I thank God to none of his vices&#146;  (Markham, <span class="italic">Life of Robert Fairfax</span>, 142). In 1689 William III reinstated him as equerry, and in 1692 he became secretary to John Tillotson, archbishop of Canterbury. On Tillotson's death in 1694 he retired to reside at Bishophill, York, and devoted himself to literary pursuits. In 1699 he edited and published Lord Fairfax's <span class="italic">Short Memorials</span> of the civil wars, omitting some passages for fear of offending royalists. That July he wrote an account of his adventurous ride to General Monck at Coldstream, entitling it &#145;Iter boreale&#146;  (Bell, 2.151&#150;74). He completed a memoir of the duke of Buckingham and translated the life of the Huguenot political philosopher Philippe du Plessis-Mornay. His poems are preserved in the British Library (some are printed in Johnson, ed., <span class="italic">The Fairfax Correspondence</span>, 1.cxxii&#150;cxxv). He died on 20 September 1711.<br>
<br>Fairfax's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_9076"></a><span class="headword">Brian Fairfax the younger</span>  (1676&#150;1749), <span class="occ">antiquary and scholar</span>, was born in The Mews, Westminster, on 11 April 1676. He was educated at Westminster School and accompanied his father to The Hague in 1688 to visit the prince of Orange. He was admitted on 28 June 1693 to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow and graduated BA in 1697 and proceeded MA in 1700. He was employed as commissioner of customs from 1723 to 1749. He lived with his younger brother, Ferdinando, in Panton Square and Savile Street, London, where he collected a large library and gallery of pictures. Sold after his death, it contained some 2343 volumes, including a first edition of the Coverdale <span class="roman">Bible</span> and ten early books printed by Caxton. He died, unmarried, on 7 January 1749.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_9082"></a><span class="headword">Ferdinando Fairfax</span>  (1678&#150;1749), <span class="occ">scholar</span>, was born in The Mews on 11 June 1678. He was educated at Westminster School and in 1694 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1698. He died, unmarried, on 12 February 1749.<br>
