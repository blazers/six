<span class="headword">Payne,  John Willett</span>  (1752&#150;1803), <span class="occ">naval officer and royal official</span>, was born on 23 April 1752 at St Kitts in the Leeward Islands, the second son of Ralph Payne (<i>d</i>. 1760), chief justice of the island, and his second wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gallwey, of St Kitts. His brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21652/', "Ralph Payne, later Baron Lavington")</script>. He was educated at Dr Brackyn's academy in Greenwich, where he formed a lifelong friendship with Hugh Seymour Conway. In spring 1767 he entered the Royal Naval Academy, Portsmouth, where he spent two and a half years before joining the frigate <i>Quebec</i> (32 guns).<br>
<br>Early in 1770, in the West Indies, Payne moved to Rear-Admiral Man's flagship, <i>Montague</i>. He came home in the sloop <i>Falcon</i> (18 guns) in 1773 and, after five months as midshipman in the <i>Egmont</i>, sailed for the Guinea coast, Jamaica, and Antigua with Commodore Thomas Collingwood in the <i>Rainbow</i> (44 guns). After returning to England about January 1775 he was again on the books of the <i>Egmont</i> when he passed his lieutenant's examination on 10 May.<br>
<br>On 26 December 1775 he sailed with Sir Peter Parker in the <i>Bristol</i> (50 guns) to Charlestown, and took part in the attack on Sullivan's Island. At New York he became Vice-Admiral Lord Howe's aide-de-camp in the <i>Eagle</i>, until he gained his first commission on 9 March 1777 as second lieutenant of the frigate <i>Brune</i> (32 guns), under the eccentric Captain James Ferguson, who became Payne's firm friend. Early in 1778 he moved to the <i>Phoenix</i> (40 guns) and was with Howe's squadron at Sandy Hook in July and off Rhode Island in August.<br>
<br>After rejoining Howe's flagship for a while, and then, it seems, commanding the <i>West Florida</i> (14 guns), Payne returned to England in the <i>Roebuck</i> (40 guns), and on 19 April 1779 was appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Romney</i> (50 guns). He was rapidly promoted by Commodore George Johnstone, through the influence of his half-brother Ralph, to commander of the <i>Cormorant</i> sloop on 6 November 1779 and then on 8 July 1780 to captain of the <i>Artois</i>, a captured French frigate. The following month he was caught up in a minor diplomatic row between Britain and Portugal over allegations of his having pressed Portuguese subjects when lying in the Tagus.<br>
<br>In August 1781 Payne took command of the frigate <i>Enterprize</i> (28 guns), cruising on the Jamaica station. In December 1782 Admiral Hugh Pigot gave him the <i>Leander</i> (50 guns), and near Guadeloupe on the night of 18 January 1783, while escorting a convoy, he came across a hostile ship which he chased and fought a two-hour engagement with. The identity of the other ship was never established, but it appeared to be a 74. Out-gunned, the <i>Leander</i> was very heavily damaged, but repulsed attempts at boarding, and Payne was rewarded for his gallantry with command of the <i>Princess Amelia</i> (80 guns), in which he returned home at the end of the war.<br>
<br>Shortly after this Payne became acquainted with George, prince of Wales, and there began between them what the prince later described as &#145;an old and steady friendship of upwards of twenty years standing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, vol. 4, no. 1780). In August 1785 Payne accompanied Lord Northington on the grand tour, visiting Paris, Geneva, Turin, Rome, and Naples. On his return in March or April 1786 he became the prince of Wales's private secretary and keeper of the privy seal, and subsequently also comptroller of the prince's household. He was elected MP for Huntingdon from 9 May 1787 on the recommendation of Lord Sandwich, who owed him money; he held the seat until 1796. In October 1787 Payne was appointed captain of the <i>Phoenix</i>, but he does not appear to have got near the sea in that command.<br>
<br>Throughout the crisis of November 1788 to February 1789 caused by George III's porphyria, Payne was very active in dealing on the prince's behalf with the supporters of a regency, especially Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Lord Loughborough. As a close friend, Payne also joined in the prince's ribald entertainments: at one masquerade, for example, &#145;Jack Payne &hellip; was dressed as a young lady &hellip; [and] chaperoned by Mrs Fitzherbert [the prince's secret Catholic wife]&#146;  (Molloy, 2.209). On another occasion, a disrespectful reference to the queen is said to have drawn from Jane, duchess of Gordon, the reproach: &#145;You little, insignificant, good-for-nothing, upstart, pert chattering puppy, how dare you name your royal master's royal mother in that style!&#146;  (ibid., 2.240). During July and August 1791 he was in France on the prince's business, and in October he was appointed (in addition to his other duties) auditor and secretary of the duchy of Cornwall.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1793 seems to have interrupted Payne's search for a little country &#145;cottage&#146; with a few acres of paddock; and from May he commanded the <i>Russell</i> (74 guns) in Howe's fleet. Fourth in the line, the <i>Russell</i> played a distinguished part in the battle of the Glorious First of June (1794), boarding <span class="italic">L'Amerique</span>, and &#145;our brave Captain [Payne, who] had many narrow escapes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, 33), was one of those awarded a gold medal. Naturally, it was &#145;little Jacko Payne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, vol. 2, no. 895) in the <i>Jupiter</i> (50 guns), who was entrusted with the flotilla sent to Cuxhaven to bring the prince's future bride, Princess Caroline, to England between February and April 1795. Lady Jersey's scheming, and Payne's disapproval of the prince's conduct towards the princess, however, caused a rift between the two men, and in July 1796 he was formally dismissed from all his posts in the prince's service.<br>
<br>That summer Payne took command of the <i>Imp&eacute;tueux</i> (80 guns) which, as <i>L'Amerique</i>, he had played a part in capturing two years before; and for three successive summers he led squadrons cruising the Western Approaches. In poor health for some years, this last command brought on a severe illness which compelled him to resign.<br>
<br>Reconciled with his old friend in January 1799, and a rear-admiral since 14 February, Payne became treasurer of Greenwich Hospital in August, following the prince of Wales's personal appeal to William Pitt on his behalf. In November, <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported that Payne was to live in a house which the prince had bought and furnished for that purpose, next door to his own, Carlton House. He died, however, probably at the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, on 17 November 1803, and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 25 November.<br>
