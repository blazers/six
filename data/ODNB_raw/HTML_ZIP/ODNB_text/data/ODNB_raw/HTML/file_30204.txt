<span class="headword">Yeardley, Sir  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1627), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was baptized in St Saviour's, Southwark, on 23 July 1588, the second son of Ralph Yeardley (1549&#150;1603), merchant taylor, and his second wife, Rhoda Marston (<i>fl</i>. 1575&#150;1588). About 1605 he went to the Netherlands to serve in the English army under Sir Thomas Gates. On 15 May 1609 he embarked at Woolwich for Virginia, again serving with Gates, who commanded the fleet and bore instructions to act as Virginia's lieutenant-general. Gates was shipwrecked in the Bermudas in the <i>Sea Adventure</i> in an incident that probably inspired Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Tempest</span>. The fleet's stragglers, including Yeardley and Gates, finally reached Jamestown in May 1610.<br>
<br>Yeardley later contrasted the actions of Virginia's early governors with the repressive, quasi-military order imposed in the colony by Marshal Sir Thomas Dale in 1611&#150;16. However, in April 1616, just as Dale was leaving the colony, Yeardley was himself appointed deputy governor of Virginia pending the arrival of Dale's successor. He relaxed constraints on trading relations with the local Native Americans imposed by Dale, whereupon the colony briefly prospered. Samuel Argall's arrival as governor on 15 May 1617 allowed Yeardley to return that summer to England, where he married, on 18 October 1618, Temperance (1581&#150;1630), daughter of Anthony Flowerdieu of Scatton, Norfolk, and Martha Stanley. Exactly a month later he was appointed to serve three years as governor of Virginia, and was knighted by James I during an audience at Newmarket on 24 November.<br>
<br>Yeardley embarked for Virginia in January 1619 with instructions to abolish martial law, address native relations, and regularize land tenure changes before summoning the first representative assembly in an English colony. He was also charged with reducing the production of tobacco, starting silk, wine, and iron production, and with preparing for large scale immigration organized under patents issued by the Virginia Company's London office. His first duty, however, was to address the alleged abuses of Argall's governorship, which ended on 10 April 1619. He then turned to Sir Thomas Smith's ambition of providing education for the natives within a university or college at Henrico; the Revd Thomas Lorkin was appointed to teach there but could not find adequate buildings within the ruinous settlement. On 30 July 1619 Yeardley summoned Virginia's first assembly but failed to win its loyalty to his reform programme, as his secretary, and the assembly's first speaker, John Pory, recorded. Meanwhile, as the London company lurched towards bankruptcy, Sir Edwin Sandys, its treasurer and a leading representative of the opposing faction within the assembly, gained such effective control of policy and partisans as to make Yeardley's programme nearly impossible to implement. John Rolfe reported that Sandys's initiatives forced Yeardley into conflicts of principle with the tobacco growers, especially after the landing of twenty negro slaves from an armed Dutch ship in 1620. Exasperated by the arrival of 1000 unskilled settlers in 1621 Yeardley resigned the governorship, but retained his responsibilities until Sir Francis Wyatt arrived on 8 November 1621 with a charter granted by James I on 24 July regularizing the assumed powers of Virginia's assembly.<br>
<br>This allowed Yeardley to attend to salt and tobacco production on the tidewater estates granted to him in 1618. His estate comprised Weymock, and parcels of land called Kouwan (now known as Kickotan) along the Mapsock Creek near Charles City, and others near &#145;James Cittie&#146; (Jamestown). He also acquired a land grant of 1000 acres at Stanley by the Warwick River. This site, called Hungars, was within the 80,000 acres of Northampton hundred being settled by Sandys' unskilled, hostile partisans. Here Yeardley built new corn and iron mills demonstrating the benefits of diversifying away from tobacco.<br>
<br>Yeardley continued to serve on the governor's council rendering valuable advice, particularly after the massacre of colonists by Native Americans in 1622. In 1625, after the revocation of the Virginia Company's charter in 1624, thereby making Virginia a royal colony, he was sent by Virginia's convention to report to the privy council in England. On 24 October the privy council accorded him immunity from any action resulting from his reports and analyses of the colony's problems of civil order and its narrow economic base, before reappointing him Virginia's royal governor on 14 March 1626. He departed in the <i>Ann</i>, with <i>James</i> as consort, on 19 April 1626, bearing instructions to list each plantation, boat, and colonist, and to make the colony diversify into fruit and corn production or regulated cattle husbandry. During 1627 the privy council sought that he regulate local shipping and open the colony's ports to ships of the Dutch West Indies Company as an extension of the Anglo-Dutch war with France and Spain. Yeardley's half-hearted response reflected the failing health mentioned in his will of 12 October 1627 and its codicil of 29 October. He died on 10 November at James City and was buried in the parish church on 13 November 1627. His will provided that Temperance, as sole executor, should realize all his estate; one third of the proceeds of sale was due to his wife and one third for his eldest son, Argall (<i>b</i>. 1619), the rest being for his younger children, Francis (<i>b</i>. 1622) and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1622). However, the will's instructions were never executed because Yeardley's brother Ralph refused to account for the estate's proceeds with the executor. Temperance went on to marry Francis West, late governor of Virginia, and died in England at Stanfield, Norfolk, in 1630. Argall Yeardley remained at Hungars until 1655; Elizabeth and Francis migrated south after their marriages in 1645 and 1647 as described in Colonel Francis Yeardley's &#145;Narrative of Excursions into Carolina, 1653&#150;54&#146;.<br>
