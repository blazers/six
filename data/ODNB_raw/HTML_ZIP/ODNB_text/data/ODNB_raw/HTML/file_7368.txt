<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Day,  John</span>  (1573/4&#150;1638?), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born at Cawston, Norfolk, the son of Walter Day, husbandman. He attended school at Ely, and on 24 October 1592, at the age of eighteen, entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Barely six months later, on 4 May 1593, he was expelled for stealing a book.<br>
<br>Day is next heard of in 1598, when he sold a play, &#145;The Conquest of Brute&#146;, to the Admiral's Men for &pound;2. This appears to have been revised by (or with) his older colleague Henry Chettle and performed with some success, since Chettle immediately began work on a sequel. Having got his start with the company, Day wrote regularly for it for the next five years, though of his plays recorded in Philip Henslowe's diary the only one to survive is a further collaboration with Chettle, <span class="italic">The Blind Beggar of Bednal Green</span> (1600, first printed in 1659). Day apparently called on his Norfolk origins in creating several characters in this play. At one point young Strowd recalls being &#145;as naked as your <i>Norfolk</i>-Dumplin&#146;  (sig. D2<i>v</i>), and the play is filled with assertions of regional pride and plain yeoman virtues.<br>
<br>In 1599 Day wrote with William Haughton two domestic murder plays, &#145;Cox of Collumpton&#146; and &#145;The Tragedy of Thomas Merry&#146;, the latter at least being based on contemporary events. Another lost play of the same year, &#145;The Orphan's Tragedy&#146;, which Day wrote with Chettle and Haughton, may be of similar provenance. This was also the year in which the playwright Henry Porter was killed by &#145;John Daye of Southwark, yeoman&#146;, and although the name is a common one, it is possible that this was the result of a quarrel between two of Henslowe's dramatists&#151;of whom, incidentally, there is no record of collaboration on a play. Day claimed self-defence, was convicted of manslaughter, and apparently pardoned.<br>
<br>&#145;Cox of Collumpton&#146; was seen by Simon Forman at the Rose Theatre in the spring of 1600, and his summary is interesting not only because it supplies the basic plot but also for its account of a stage bear that drives two guilty brothers to suicide. Day collaborated with Thomas Dekker, Chettle, and Haughton on five further plays in 1600, and early in the following year he and Haughton wrote parts 2 and 3 of <span class="italic">The Blind Beggar</span>, indicating that the first instalment had been judged a winning formula. (The sequels have unfortunately not survived.) Day appears to have made a reasonable living working for Henslowe: he remained an active contributor to the Admiral's repertory after the company moved to the new Fortune Theatre, and was paid over &pound;7 for work on four collaborations between February and May 1601. When Worcester's Men took over the Rose Theatre in 1602, Day wrote for both companies and his earnings rose to a healthy &pound;14 for the season.<br>
<br>The record of Day's lost plays for Henslowe allows glimpses of the playwright's forays into action drama in &#145;The Conquest of the West Indies&#146; and &#145;The Conquest of Spain by John of Gaunt&#146; (both 1601), and occasional essays at the history play, in addition to domestic tragedies and city comedies. In 1602&#150;3 he was employed with Chettle to write or revise a play about &#145;Shore's wife&#146;, and a few verse lines in Day's hand dating from about 1601 (preserved in <span class="italic">The Alleyn Papers</span>, 24) appear to conclude a play about defeated rebellion by &#145;Percy&#146; and his &#145;gallant band&#146;, one that was perhaps trying to catch the wave of success enjoyed by Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> plays.<br>
<br>The first of Day's plays to be printed (and apart from <span class="italic">The Blind Beggar</span> the earliest to survive) was <span class="italic">The Isle of Gulls</span> (1606), written for the Children of the Queen's Revels, the boys' company that acted at the Blackfriars playhouse. This appears to have been a new departure for Day, not only in the play's auspices and venue, but also in his cultivation of the kind of topical satire that was fashionable in the private theatres. Day drew on Sir Philip Sidney's <span class="italic">Arcadia</span> for his plot, and in the prologue protested that a writer seeking to &#145;ope the vaine of sinne&#146; should not be &#145;inform'd against for libelling&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>). His plea was disregarded: on 7 March 1606 Sir Edward Hoby reported &#145;much speech of a play in the Black Friars, where, in the <span class="roman">Isle of the Gulls</span>, from the highest to the lowest &hellip; all men's parts were acted of two divers nations: as I understand sundry were committed to Bridewell&#146;  (Birch, 1.60&#150;61). The &#145;two divers nations&#146; were apparently the English and the Scots, so that the royal circle of King Basilius in the <span class="italic">Arcadia</span> was transformed by the actors' accents into the confrontational world of James I's court in its early years&#151;a satire made more pointed by the inclusion in the play of a hunting scene, highly redolent of James but nowhere part of King Basilius's leisure activities in Sidney's original. Like another Blackfriars play, <span class="italic">Eastward Ho!</span>, in the previous year, and for similar reasons, <span class="italic">The Isle of Gulls</span> apparently got its makers into trouble; and punishment this time meant not only imprisonment of the leading players&#151;though not, as far as is known, of Day himself&#151;but also the loss of Queen Anne's patronage. The company had to drop the word &#145;Queen's&#146; from their title, as the title-page of the printed quarto of the play shows; and there is evidence of interference during printing of the play, with the publisher's name being removed from the title-page and titles like &#145;king&#146; and &#145;queen&#146; substituted by &#145;duke&#146; and &#145;duchess&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Isle of Gulls</span> is a lively and accomplished satire, and Day composed two further comedies for the boys that have survived: <span class="italic">Law-Trickes, or, Who would have Thought it</span> (which was probably written with George Wilkins), and <span class="italic">Humour out of Breath</span>, both published in 1608. All these plays show Day at home in the elegant and witty milieu of the children's theatres, capitalizing on what Shakespeare had added to the comic vocabulary of earlier writers for the boys' companies like John Lyly, and giving it a Jacobean edge. However, Day had not turned his back on the popular stage. His fifth extant play was written for Queen Anne's Men and acted at the Red Bull in Clerkenwell, a playhouse with a reputation for bombast and crowd-pleasing spectacle. <span class="italic">The Travels of the Three English Brothers</span>, which Day wrote with William Rowley and George Wilkins in 1607, relates a current political story with unusual freedom and directness&#151;Day was clearly not cowed by official dislike of <span class="italic">The Isle of Gulls</span>, since he risked further censure with this play about the adventures of the Sherley brothers, minor Sussex gentry whose exploits abroad earned them the intense disapproval of the English government. The play's dedication &#145;To Honour's favourites&#146;, however, is a canny appeal to the more militant ethos of Prince Henry and his circle; and its dramatization of the Sherley visit to Persia, and of subsequent efforts to raise support for a Perso-Christian alliance against the Turks, offers a flattering image of English courage and diplomatic skill in the trickiest of contexts. <span class="italic">The Travels</span> is not a very polished play, but it is one of the most interesting treatments on the early-modern stage of cultural encounter and exotic ordeal.<br>
<br>Day drops out of sight after 1608, apart from an entry in the Stationers' register in August 1610 of &#145;A Booke called the Madde Prancks of Merry Moll of the Bankside &hellip; Written by John Day&#146;. This, if it was a stage work, may have been a Red Bull anticipation of the successful play about Moll Frith, <span class="italic">The Roaring Girl</span> by Middleton and Dekker, acted at the Fortune in the early summer of 1611. Day is next heard of a decade later, in January 1620, when a play called &#145;Guy of Warwick&#146; was entered in the Stationers' register under his and Dekker's names. Two more plays followed, both probably collaborations with Dekker: &#145;The Bellman of Paris&#146; was licensed for performance by the Prince's Men at the Red Bull in July 1623, and &#145;Come see a wonder&#146; was acted on the same stage in September of that year. None of these works has survived, and there is no further record of Day's activity in the theatre. His stage career, though possibly interrupted, was a long one; for most of it he was a jobbing dramatist invariably collaborating with other writers in all the fashionable genres; but his surviving work for the theatre, nearly all from a brief period between 1605 and 1608 when he also wrote at least two single-authored plays, shows him to have been a writer of distinctive accomplishments.<br>
<br>Day was the author also of two non-dramatic writings. <span class="italic">The Parliament of Bees</span> survives in manuscript (BL, Lansdowne MS 725) and in a 1641 quarto, of which the title-page describes the work as &#145;A Bee-hive furnisht with twelve Honycombes, as Pleasant as Profitable. Being an Allegoricall description of the actions of good and bad men in these our daies.&#146; The quarto text is a revision of the manuscript, which must have been composed before 1634, when <span class="italic">The Noble Soldier</span> by Dekker and Rowley, which borrows several passages from Day's text, was published. Charles Lamb admired the work, and quoted from it in his &#145;Extracts from the Garrick Plays&#146;, thereby giving Day's poetry wider currency than his plays have ever achieved. Lamb and earlier editors cite a 1607 quarto of the <span class="italic">Bees</span>, but this has not been found. The other work is a manuscript prose tract entitled &#145;Peregrinatio scholastica, or, Learneinges pillgrimage&#146; (BL, Sloane MS 3150). It appears to belong to Day's later years, since in the epistle the author hopes that his efforts &#145;may not finde the lesse welcome in reguard I boast not that gawdie spring of credit and youthfull florish of opinion as some other filde in the same rancke with me&#146;  (sig. f.2<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Day's death is the subject of an elegy by his friend and fellow dramatist John Tatham in the latter's <span class="italic">The Fancies Theater</span> (1640). The poem laboriously puns on Day's name in likening his death to an eclipse (&#145;in that sight was ta'ne away, / Our thrice desir'd refulgent day&#146;; sig. F3<i>v</i>), but it is possible that Tatham was taking advantage of an actual eclipse that &#145;did late arise&#146; on 11 December 1638. This date is consistent with Day's being the John Dey of Eydolveston, Norfolk, whose will was proved at Norwich in 1639.<br>
