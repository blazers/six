<span class="headword">Neal,  Ernest Gordon</span>  (1911&#150;1998), <span class="occ">biologist and schoolmaster</span>, was born on 20 May 1911 at 106 St Johns Road, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, the youngest child in the family of two sons and two daughters of the Revd Frederick Neal (<i>d</i>. 1952), a Baptist minister, and his Scottish wife, Margaret Owen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keith (<i>d</i>. 1959), daughter of a manufacturer of ivory goods. He was educated at Taunton School from 1926 to 1929. Although he would have liked to study medicine, his family could not afford it, and he enrolled in evening classes in botany, zoology, and chemistry at Chelsea Polytechnic, teaching at Highfield School, a preparatory school, during the day. He graduated with a second-class honours degree from London University in 1934. After teaching and working as a demonstrator in the zoology department of Chelsea Polytechnic for a year, he took a teaching job at Rendcomb College, a small boarding-school for boys near Cirencester. On 30 April 1937 he married Helen Elizabeth 
    (Betty; <i>b</i>. 1913)
  , daughter of George Sutherland Thomson, a dairying and agricultural consultant; they had three sons.<br>
<br>Although Neal's application to be registered as a conscientious objector during the Second World War was rejected, he was deemed unfit to serve as a medical orderly in the armed forces, and remained at Rendcomb until 1946, when he moved to Taunton School as biology master and in 1948 became head of science. Always keen to involve his pupils in ecological projects and field trips, he published a book for schools, <span class="italic">Woodland Ecology</span>, in 1953. He became second master in 1960, and from 1960 to 1966 was also housemaster of a senior house. He retired in 1971, and with his son Keith wrote <span class="italic">Biology for Today</span> (1974; rev. edn, 1983), an O-level textbook.<br>
<br>Neal's interest in nature began as a child when he accompanied his father on butterfly-watching expeditions, and he later took up nature photography as a hobby: he published <span class="italic">Exploring Nature with a Camera</span> (1946), containing many of his black and white photographs, including pictures of the effects of the &#146;ice rain&#146; of early 1940. He first saw badgers in the wild in 1936, and as he became fascinated by their ecology and behaviour, he began to photograph them. After the success of <span class="italic">The Badger</span> (1948), the first in the Collins <span class="roman">New Naturalist</span> series of monographs, which ran to five editions and included the first colour photograph of wild badgers at night, he was in demand as a lecturer. In 1949 he made a short film of badgers, which he was asked to show at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London. This led to his making a longer film, with Professor Humphrey Hewer, which took three years to complete and which was shown on BBC television in 1954. Neal became a regular broadcaster, appearing as a member of the panel of <span class="italic">Country Questions</span> in the late 1950s, and started to make television programmes for schools in 1961.<br>
<br>A founder of the Mammal Society of the British Isles (later the Mammal Society) in 1954, Neal started the badger group, which organized a national sett survey over many years: he chaired the society from 1974 to 1980, and was elected president in 1980. At the same time he was conducting research into the reproductive cycle of the badger, which formed the basis of the dissertation he submitted for a London University PhD in 1960. In the 1970s he campaigned for legislation to protect badgers from extermination by farmers and landowners, and the first <span class="roman">Badger Act</span> was passed in 1973, protecting badgers but not their setts. In 1975, with growing evidence that badgers were implicated in infecting cattle with bovine tuberculosis, the government set up a consultative panel of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on badgers and tuberculosis, and Neal was invited to be a member, serving for fifteen years. Gassing of badgers became illegal in 1982, and setts were given full protection in the <span class="roman">Badgers Act</span> of 1991. As part of his efforts to win over public opinion, in 1977 Neal organized <span class="italic">Badger Watch</span>, a series of live television programmes on five consecutive nights at a badger sett in Gloucestershire. He was advisory editor for the Blandford <span class="roman">Mammal Series</span>, contributing the volume <span class="italic">Badgers</span> (1977), and later became editor of the <span class="roman">Helm Mammal Series</span>. He published <span class="italic">The Natural History of Badgers</span> (1986), revised as <span class="italic">Badgers</span> in 1996 with the help of Chris Cheeseman.<br>
<br>Neal visited Africa for the first time in 1962, and in 1969 he accepted an invitation to study the banded mongoose and other small nocturnal carnivores in the Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, work which he summarized in <span class="italic">Uganda Quest</span> (1971). He became interested in the ecology of Africa, and was invited to be a guest lecturer for Swan Hellenic and Ecosafaris, accompanying wildlife safaris in east Africa and the Seychelles until 1990. He contributed <span class="italic">On Safari in East Africa: a Background Guide</span> (1991) to the Collins <span class="roman">Natural History Series</span>.<br>
<br>Neal was elected a fellow of the Institute of Biology in 1963, and in 1966 he was given the Sir Stamford Raffles award by the Zoological Society of London. He was appointed MBE in 1976 for his work as chairman of the Somerset Trust for Nature Conservation, which he had helped to found. A practising Christian all his life, he was a deacon of Albemarle Baptist church in Taunton. His autobiography, <span class="italic">The Badger Man: Memoirs of a Biologist</span>, was published in 1994. He died on 5 April 1998 at Dial House, 38 Park Avenue, Bedford. He was survived by his wife, Betty.<br>
