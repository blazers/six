<span class="headword">Bernard</span> <span class="st"> [Bernard the Scribe]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1123&#150;1130), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, came from a middle-ranking thegnly family in Cornwall, which, like many others, had suffered loss of estates and social depression as a result of the Norman conquest. His grandfather, Theodulf, had a modest estate in Cornwall; his father, Ailsi, was a master builder in Launceston; and his uncle, Brihtric, in 1084 held five small manors in Cornwall of the count of Mortain. Bernard had two brothers: the elder, Jordan, was a landowner near Launceston, and the younger, Nicholas, was another royal scribe. Both Bernard and Nicholas seem to have been unmarried, and Bernard may, like Nicholas, have become a canon of the Augustinian priory of Merton in Surrey. Jordan, however had a son, Peter of Cornwall, who became prior of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, and early in the thirteenth century made a vast collection of visions and revelations which throw some light on the family's history.<br>
<br>As a <i>scriptor</i> (&#145;scribe&#146;) Bernard clearly set himself, with the help of his royal master and of his chancery superiors and colleagues, to recover through litigation what ancestral lands he could; and he also benefited from rewards from his patrons and satisfied clients. Some of his acquisitions probably went with his office. In Cornwall he had the land and revenues of Gisulf, the royal scribe who had perished in the wreck of the <i>White Ship</i> on 25 November 1120, a man whom Orderic Vitalis despised. The grant by the king of a vacant plot in Launceston Castle, &#145;between the well and the chapel&#146;, was for his lodgings. He also held in the castle the land of Ranulf the chancellor and an orchard. In Winchester he had a tenement in Parchment Street, which Count Stephen of Mortain relieved of a rent-charge, and in Busket Lane, by grant of William de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, sheriff of Hampshire and royal chamberlain, two tenements which had belonged first to the clerk Anselm and then to Gisulf. As he does not appear by name in either of the Winchester surveys, Bernard's tenure of property there probably lies between <i>c</i>.1110 and 1148. In London, similarly, by confirmatory charter of John of Bayeux, a royal chaplain and bastard son of Bishop Odo of Bayeux, he held land and houses which had been Gisulf's, together with a soke held of the archbishop of Canterbury, free of all service so long as he served in the royal court. But if he left the court he had to make specified payments to John. Further afield he had land in Northamptonshire, and in Normandy at Mathieu near Caen.<br>
<br>As scribes are not itemized in <span class="italic">Constitutio domus regis</span>, a guide to the royal household prepared for King Stephen, it would seem that the compiler regarded them as of relatively lowly status. But Bernard was on occasion, perhaps usually, attended by two or three squires, and he is always found in the company of ministerial colleagues of high standing in the court. He and his brother Nicholas divided their wealth between their eldest brother's family, the church of Launceston, and Merton Priory. Launceston inherited <i>inter alia</i> the silver-embossed ivory writing-case with silver ink-horn they had used in the king's service. The church converted it into a reliquary. Although he attested none of Henry I's charters, Bernard was a rather grand royal domestic servant.<br>
