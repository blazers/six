<span class="headword">Sitch,  Charles Henry</span>  (1887&#150;1960), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Saltney, Chester, on 4 May 1887, the third son of <a name="cosubject_48917"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Sitch</span>  (1852&#150;1923), <span class="occ">chain maker and trade unionist</span>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Young). Thomas Sitch was born at Cradley Heath, Staffordshire, on 23 July 1852, the son of a chain maker. He started work in Cradley Heath at the age of eight and subsequently moved first to Newcastle upon Tyne, where he met and married his wife, and then to Saltney, Chester.<br>
<br>While working in Saltney in 1889 Thomas Sitch formed the Chainmakers' and Strikers' Association of Saltney, Pontypridd and Staffordshire. This was a union for men who worked in factories making big chain, such as ships' cable. The innumerable varieties of small chain were made by outworkers, many of whom were women, so the trade was effectively divided into two branches. In the outwork section unremitting downward pressure on wages arising from intense competition for employment was not conducive to unionization. However, this was not the case in the factory section, and this allowed Sitch to build the Chainmakers' and Strikers' Association into an effective organization and in 1894 he was appointed its full-time general secretary. He then returned to Cradley Heath, the main centre of the chain trade, and became a widely respected public figure. He served with distinction on both Rowley Regis urban district council and Staffordshire county council, being chairman of the former in 1911, and in 1913 he was made a JP. Thomas Sitch died on 23 April 1923 at his home, Unity Villa, Sydney Road, Cradley Heath, which also served as the union office. He was survived by his wife. He was buried in St Luke's churchyard, Cradley Heath.<br>
<br>Charles Henry Sitch moved to Cradley Heath with his parents when he was seven. He went to the local elementary school, leaving at the age of thirteen to work in a grocer's shop. With financial support from the Chainmakers' and Strikers' Association, however, he went to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he studied economics and related subjects for two years. This experience and his family background led naturally to a strong interest in trade unionism and Sitch subsequently played a leading part in union activity in and around Cradley Heath, particularly among the female outworkers in the chain trade. However, it was not until the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) began recruiting in Cradley Heath, soon after its formation in 1906, that real progress was made in the unionization of these casual workers. Sitch became secretary of the hand-hammered chain branch of the NFWW and, together with Mary Macarthur, mounted a vigorous campaign to secure statutory protection for the outworkers. The agitation ensured that small chainmaking was included in the 1909 <span class="roman">Trade Boards Act</span>, which provided for the establishment of minimum wages in four sweated industries. Sitch was among the first members of the Chain Trade Board which within four years, in addition to setting a minimum wage, raised piece-work rates by up to two-thirds.<br>
<br>The success of the Chain Trade Board led to other Black Country sweated industries being organized on similar lines and Sitch was a central figure in this process becoming, <i>inter alia</i>, vice-chairman of the Stourbridge and district firebrick wages and conciliation board and the women workers' representative on the Hollow-Ware Trade Board. In 1913 he was appointed assistant secretary of the Chainmakers' and Strikers' Association and from 1914 to 1918 he was president of the South Staffordshire and Worcestershire Federation of Trades Councils (he was exempted from military service on medical grounds). Away from work his main interest was amateur operatics. He acted as honorary secretary of the Cradley Heath, Old Hill and District Amateur Operatic Society for many years and was also a leading performer in its productions, often appearing with his wife, Mabel Jackson, who came from Goole.<br>
<br>Sitch's work as a union organizer was the springboard for his political career. He was elected to the Rowley Regis urban district council as a Liberal in 1913 but switched to Labour in 1916 and at the 1918 general election he won the formerly safe Conservative seat of Kingswinford with a majority of 2888. He remained in parliament until 1931 but made little impression mainly because from the end of 1922 he had to devote most of his time to the affairs of the Chainmakers' and Strikers' Association following his appointment as general secretary in succession to his father.<br>
<br>Sitch took over the union just as its membership and finances were beginning to decline. One consequence of this was that his wages were progressively reduced to only &pound;2 per week and when he lost his parliamentary salary he could no longer afford the expensive tastes which both he and his wife had acquired. His solution was to use the union's funds, which he controlled virtually unsupervised, for his private purposes. His deception was eventually discovered and in 1933 he was found guilty of fraudulently converting the Chainmakers' and Strikers' Association's funds and sent to prison for nine months.<br>
<br>The disgrace inevitably ended Sitch's public career and on his release from prison he moved away from Cradley Heath. He eventually settled in Leeds where, from 1937, he was employed by <span class="italic">Reynolds News</span> (later the <span class="italic">Sunday Citizen</span>) as a collector and organizer for a scheme through which co-operative societies supported the newspaper. He continued to live in Leeds after his retirement in 1952 and died at his home there, 116 Harrogate Road, Chapeltown, on 13 June 1960 from pulmonary tuberculosis. His wife survived him.<br>
