<span class="headword">Charlton, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1417&#150;1465), <span class="occ">landowner and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was the son and heir of Sir Thomas Charlton of Hillingdon (<i>d</i>. 1445), landowner and MP, and his wife, Elizabeth Fraunceys (<i>d</i>. 1451). Through his mother's aunt Maud, the wife of John Montagu, third earl of Salisbury, Charlton was related to the latter's granddaughter Alice, who in 1422 married Richard Neville, fifth earl of Salisbury, and thus also to her son, Richard Neville, sixteenth earl of Warwick; it was a connection in which the Charlton family took considerable pride.<br>
<br>By Michaelmas 1441 the younger Thomas Charlton had entered Henry VI's household as one of the esquires of the hall and chamber, and the following January he was elected to the first of the six parliaments in which he represented his native county of Middlesex. On 21 January 1442, a few days before parliament assembled, he married Benedicta, a daughter of the midland landowner and former speaker of the Commons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28245/', "Sir Richard Vernon (1389/90&#150;1451)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52800/', "Vernon family")</script>]. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>The deaths of Charlton's father and mother in 1445 and 1451 respectively gave him control of his family's extensive estates in Middlesex, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, London, and Essex, and allowed him to assume a leading position in local society. He represented Middlesex in the parliaments of 1447 and 1449&#150;50, served on the county bench, and received occasional appointments to <i>ad hoc</i> commissions. It may have been in recognition of his new status as the wealthiest lay landowner in Middlesex that he was knighted not long after, possibly at the ceremony held on 5 January 1453 for the dubbing of Henry VI's half-brothers, the newly created earls of Pembroke and Richmond.<br>
<br>In February 1453 Charlton was once more elected to represent Middlesex in parliament. The first two sessions, in March and April, were comparatively uneventful, but during the summer prorogation Henry VI lost his mental and physical faculties, a condition probably brought about by the news of the final English defeat at Castillon in Gascony on 17 July. The king's collapse provided an opportunity for Richard, duke of York, to stake his claim to assume control of the government. In the late autumn the speaker of the Commons, Thomas Thorpe, was arrested at York's behest, and on 16 February 1454 Charlton was elected in his stead. He may well have been something of a compromise candidate for the office, since, as well as being a member of the royal household, Charlton was connected with York through his Neville kinsmen. Nevertheless, Abbot John Whethamstede of St Albans, who was then engaged in a dispute with Charlton over the Hertfordshire manor of Burston, maintained that Sir Thomas had deliberately sought the speakership in order to promote a bill that would allow him to recover that manor, which his father had granted away.<br>
<br>The duke of York's second protectorate in 1455&#150;6 gave Charlton an opportunity to renew his claim to Burston. He was by now firmly associated with the Yorkist cause, and in December 1455 was appointed sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Yet at the same time his continued membership of the royal household allowed him to remain on good terms with the court party, and consequently he was not only returned to the Lancastrian-dominated &#145;parliament of devils&#146; held at Coventry in November 1459, but a month later headed the commissioners appointed to array the men of Middlesex to resist an anticipated invasion by the exiled Yorkist lords from Calais.<br>
<br>When the invasion came in the summer of 1460, Charlton rapidly rejoined the Yorkist side. After the earl of Warwick's victory at Northampton on 10 July he was among the judges who tried the Lancastrian defenders of the Tower of London. A few weeks later, he was elected to the parliament summoned to undo the measures of the previous year's partisan assembly, and about the same time he was made comptroller of the household. In that capacity Charlton accompanied Henry VI to the second battle of St Albans on 17 February 1461. He was taken prisoner by Queen Margaret's victorious forces, and taken to York in the queen's train, but regained his freedom after Edward IV's victory at Towton on 29 March.<br>
<br>Charlton's apparent commitment to the Yorkist cause was not matched by commensurate appointments to crown offices after Edward IV's accession. Although a valuable collar of the new king's livery of suns and roses was among his possessions at his death, he received only a single royal commission in the first four years of the new reign, and is not known to have held any other office. Early in 1465 his life was suddenly cut short, presumably by illness, and he died on 26 February, having made a short will earlier that day, in which he requested burial on the north side of the high altar in All Saints' Church, Edmonton. His wife had predeceased him, having died some time before May 1463.<br>
<br>John Whethamstede had earlier characterized Sir Thomas as a young and factious knight, describing him as &#145;sly &hellip; cunning, and subtle&#146;, like a fox  (Riley, 2.136). The abbot certainly did not intend to flatter a local rival and adversary. But his acerbic words can still be regarded as constituting a backhanded compliment to Charlton's political skills, which almost to the end of the 1450s enabled him to maintain good relations with both the court and the increasingly disaffected Yorkist lords, as England slipped into civil war.<br>
