<span class="headword">Knight, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1613, <em>d.</em> 1683), <span class="occ">merchant and local politician</span>, the third but second surviving son of George Knight (<i>d</i>. 1659), a mercer, and his wife, Anne, the daughter of William Deyos, was baptized on 24 November 1613 in Bristol. He inherited his father's business in Temple Street, and became one of the most prosperous merchants in the city and a prominent high-church member of the common council. On 9 April 1640 he married Martha, the daughter of Thomas Cole, a merchant, of Bristol; they had three sons and eight daughters.<br>
<br>Knight was knighted by Charles II on 5 September 1663, on the occasion of the king's visit to Bristol, and elected mayor in the same year. His tenure of office was a year of terror distinguished by his persecution of radical sectarians under the old recusancy laws and the <span class="roman">Conventicles Act</span> (1664). A critic of republican ideas who feared radical risings, he had Baptists arrested, disrupted Quaker meetings, paid large sums to have their houses watched, and concerted measures with Guy Carleton, bishop of Bristol, for their punishment. Some 920 persons are said to have suffered for their religion during his mayoralty, and many moderate churchmen were scandalized by the mayor's rushing out of church on Sundays in pursuit of recalcitrant nonconformists.<br>
<br>Knight's intolerance increased with the years, and in 1669 he denounced the other members of the common council, including his cousin and namesake John Knight, who was mayor of Bristol in the following year, as &#145;fanatics&#146;. In 1680, being infirm, he desired the city to nominate another person to take care of their affairs in the common council, but though he no longer had any official status he still occasionally acted as an informer. His antipathy to Roman Catholics was as strong as that against nonconformists. In 1681 he was fined for assaulting the mayor of Bristol in the course of his duty, and for calling several members of the common council &#145;papists, popish dogs, jesuits, and popish devils&#146;. In August 1680 he had acted as emissary from William Bedloe to Chief-Justice North before the latter's receiving Bedloe's dying deposition, and it is apropos of this that Roger North sums him up as &#145;the most perverse, clamorous old party man in the whole city or nation&#146;  (North, 253).<br>
<br>Knight became a member of the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers in 1639 and was master of the society in 1663&#150;4. He represented Bristol during the parliaments of 1661, 1678, and 1679, and was highly indignant at not being re-elected in 1681. He sat on seven committees concerned with ecclesiastical legislation in the Cavalier Parliament and served in the two Exclusion Parliaments. He died in December 1683, and was buried at Temple Church, Bristol. The value of his estate is not mentioned in his will, but it does not seem to have been substantial.<br>
