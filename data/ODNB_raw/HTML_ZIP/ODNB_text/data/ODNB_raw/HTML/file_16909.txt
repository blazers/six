<span class="headword">Lockhart,  William Ewart</span>  (1846&#150;1900), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 18 February 1846 at Eaglesfield, Dumfriesshire, the illegitimate son of Ann Lockhart (<i>b</i>. 1823), a domestic servant, and Thomas Ewart (1823&#150;1881), a farm labourer. Raised by his maternal grandparents in Annan, at the age of fourteen he enrolled at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh. Lockhart also attended life classes at the Royal Scottish Academy where he was a pupil of Robert Scott Lauder and John Blake MacDonald. Lockhart contracted tuberculosis in 1863 and spent eighteen months recovering in Australia, thereafter spending most winters abroad. Spain became the inspiration of some of his best work, such as <span class="italic">The Cid and the Five Moorish Kings</span> (watercolour version exh. Edinburgh International Exhibition, 1886; Perth City Art Gallery) and <span class="italic">The Swineherd</span> (oil; exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1885; McManus Galleries, Dundee).<br>
<br>Lockhart settled in Edinburgh, and on 5 February 1869 married Mary Blake Will (1846&#150;1934), his tutor's niece; they had four daughters and a son. He was a visitor at the Royal Scottish Academy, and became an associate of the academy in 1871 and a member in 1878. His reputation as a watercolourist rests mainly on his scenes of the Scottish east coast though nowhere is his expertise in this medium better seen than in <span class="italic">Durham</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1882; priv. coll.). However, the landscape painter John MacWhirter wrote in his obituary of Lockhart that &#145;He excelled in nearly all branches&#151;landscape, portraiture and semi-historical subjects. His manner was broad and daring in colour, but he could also be very minute and refined, especially in his architectural works&#146;  (MacWhirter). A number of Lockhart's works were reproduced as illustrations to editions of Scott, Burns, and Stevenson.<br>
<br>Lockhart executed over four hundred paintings, twenty-nine of which were exhibited at the Royal Academy. He was made a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1878, and of the Royal Society of Engravers in 1881. He was president of the Scottish Arts Club from 1883 to 1888, and was the Royal Scottish Academy's representative as a trustee of the British Institution at the time of his death. In 1884 Lockhart moved to London, but was in Edinburgh in 1886 to escort Queen Victoria around the International Exhibition, which contained three of his best Spanish works, including <span class="italic">Gil Blas and the Archbishop of Granada</span> (oil; exh. RA, 1879; NG Scot.). In 1887 the queen commissioned him to paint <span class="italic">The Golden Jubilee Service in Westminster Abbey</span> (oil; Royal Collection), his most ambitious work, measuring 92 by 120 inches and containing 278 individual portraits. It took him three years to complete, but the trials of organizing sittings and of obtaining samples of fabrics and uniforms undermined his health. The picture was reproduced in photogravure and the sketch of it was bought by the French government. It brought him popularity as a portraitist: <span class="italic">Speaker Peel</span> (oil; exh. RA, 1892), which won a medal at the Paris Salon of 1895, and <span class="italic">A. J. Balfour</span> (oil; exh. Royal Scottish Academy, 1898; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) were two of his most acclaimed portraits. Lockhart was bitterly disappointed that he was not knighted for his royal service. Depression led to his admittance to Bethlem Hospital, where he died of pneumonia on 9 February 1900. He was buried in Brookwood cemetery, Woking, on 14 February.<br>
