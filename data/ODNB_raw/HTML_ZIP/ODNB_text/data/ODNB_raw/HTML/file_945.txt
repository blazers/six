<span class="headword">Ayres,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1704<span class="mult">x</span>9), <span class="occ">writing-master</span>, according to early accounts began life in a humble way as a footman in the house of Sir William Ashurst, to whom he owed his education. His original teacher of writing was Thomas Topham, to whom he dedicated <span class="italic">The Accomplisht Clerk</span> of 1680. It is said that on marrying a fellow servant with &pound;200, Ayres was able to set himself up as a teacher of handwriting and accounts in St Paul's Churchyard, where his industry and ability soon procured him so many pupils that his income from teaching alone was said to be &pound;800 a year. Here, at the Hand and Pen near St Paul's School, he also produced a number of copybooks over the next twenty years. Samuel Pepys, who had five works by Ayres in his <span class="italic">Calligraphical Collection</span>, lists his work under the heading &#145;Maj.<sup>r</sup> Ayres&#146;, and contemporaries frequently referred to him as &#145;Major&#146; or &#145;Colonel&#146; Ayres. This title no doubt refers to his position in the City bands, and it also gives some indication of his social standing.<br>
<br>The interest taken in the work of Ayres by Pepys is a strong indication of the position he held in the field of contemporary calligraphy, of which Pepys was both collector and connoisseur. In a letter to John Bagford of 16 April 1697/8 Pepys wrote of &#145;having a particular reason&#146; to know of Ayres's latest &#145;Copy-Book, whether it be yet finished or published or no&#146;, and, if the book be available, &#145;procure a very fair one and send it to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and the Second Diary</span>, 267). Pepys was not alone in his admiration of the work of Ayres, nor was Ayres himself unaware of his fellow penmen. In his preface to <span class="italic">A Tutor to Penmanship</span> of 1698, Ayres wrote of the &#145;different state of English &amp; Forreign Pen-man-ship, at &amp; since the coming-in of Printing&#146; and praised the work of Van den Velde and Materot, as well as his English predecessors such as Richard Gething and Peter Gery in particular. In this regard it is worth noting that one of his own writing books was entitled <span class="italic">Materot redivivus</span> (1690). Towards his English contemporaries Ayres was less charitable. Most of the writing books of the period bubble with charges and counter-charges over the matter of style. The main controversy was whether &#145;owls, apes and monsters, and sprig'd letters&#146; were allowable in serious works. These fanciful shapes, intended to show off the fluency of the writing-master and his command of penstrokes, were thought by some to entice unwilling pupils to better handwriting. Attacked by Charles Snell and others on this point, Ayres responded in kind with reflections on &#145;the malice and invincible ignorance&#146; of his rivals. But although he did not despise the fanciful &#145;command of hand&#146; exercises, it was his round hand which particularly impressed people, and which continued to influence later writing-masters, and therefore the development of English handwriting. Although Ayres himself looked back to the Italian masters, it is likely that the source of his own style was the Italian hand as transmuted through the work of northern calligraphers. While he was not against the occasional calligraphic flourish, Ayres was very scathing about the trick writing of contemporary shorthand masters, for the aim of shorthand, he said, &#145;is not to write much in a little room, but to write much in a little <i>time</i>&#146;  (A. Nicholas, preface, <span class="italic">Thoographia, or, A New Art of Short-Hand</span>, 1692).<br>
<br>There is considerable difficulty&#151;and indeed diversity&#151;in listing the major works of Ayres, for reasons that are common to many of the writing books of the period. They were for the most part issued with either a printed or an engraved title-page&#151;sometimes with both&#151;and usually included some pages of text in which the writing-master made clear his attitudes and aims. Popular works, such as those of Ayres, were frequently reissued. In these instances there would often be a new letterpress title-page, and possibly new text, but the original engraved plates which contained the calligraphic examples would remain unchanged. A detailed examination of several copies of a work is often required to decide on the original date and edition&#151;and, not surprisingly in books intended for daily practical use, they have not always survived in sufficient numbers. The five works collected by Pepys (<span class="italic">The ala mode secretarie</span>, 1681; <span class="italic">The Accomplisht Clerk</span>, 1683; <span class="italic">The Penmans Daily Practise</span>, 1692; <span class="italic">A Tutor to Penmanship</span>, 1698; and <span class="italic">The Accomplish'd Clerk Regraved</span>, 1700) would make a more valuable contribution to the study of Ayres, and other penmen, if he had not preserved only the engraved plates and thrown out all printed matter&#151;title-page, text, and, more importantly, often the date as well. Even the engraved titles have been found to differ on occasions from the original printed version, thus making the work of the bibliographer doubly difficult.<br>
<br>The date of Ayres's death is unknown, though it must have occurred between 1704 and 1709, since in 1704 he handed over his school to Robert More, and in 1709 his pupil John Rayner speaks of his master as dead. Bromley's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Engraved British Portraits</span> gives the date of his death as 1705. This is said to have taken place from apoplexy while he was regaling friends at Vauxhall Gardens.<br>
