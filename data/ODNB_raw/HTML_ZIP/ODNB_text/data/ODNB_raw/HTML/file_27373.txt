<span class="headword">Thorp,  Charles</span>  (1783&#150;1862), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and university principal</span>, born at Gateshead rectory in co. Durham on 13 October 1783, was the fifth but second surviving son of Robert Thorp and his wife, Grace (1745&#150;1814), daughter of Thomas Alder of Horncliffe, on the Tweed.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_27374"></a><span class="headword">Robert Thorp</span>  (1736&#150;1812), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Chillingham in Northumberland, where his father was vicar, on 18 December 1736, the second and only surviving son of Thomas Thorp (1698&#150;1767) and his wife, Mary Robson (<i>d</i>. 1786) from Egglescliffe, near Stockton-on-Tees. He was educated at Durham School and Peterhouse, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1758 as senior wrangler, MA in 1761, and DD in 1792, and was elected fellow in 1761. He was ordained deacon in 1759, succeeded his father at Chillingham in 1768, and became perpetual curate of Doddington in 1775 before moving to be rector of Gateshead in 1781. In 1792 he was appointed archdeacon of Northumberland, and in 1795 he was presented to the rectory of Ryton, co. Durham, which he resigned in favour of his son in 1807. Besides several sermons and charges, Thorp published excerpts from (1765), and a translation of, Newton's <span class="italic">Principia</span> (1777; 2nd edn, 1802). He died at Durham on 20 April 1812 and was buried in Ryton church.<br>
<br>His son Charles Thorp, who spoke with a distinct Northumbrian burr, was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then at Durham School. Having originally been intended for Cambridge, where he was admitted pensioner at Peterhouse on 29 June 1799, he matriculated from University College, Oxford, on 10 December the same year, graduating BA in 1803, MA in 1806, BD in 1822, and DD in 1835. In 1803 he was elected a fellow and tutor of his college and was ordained in that year. In 1807 he was presented by Shute Barrington, bishop of Durham, to the rectory of Ryton, in succession to his father. He retained the living until his death. Thorp refused several valuable preferments, including the lucrative living of Stanhope, on account of his attachment to his parish. He built at his sole expense a church at Greenside in commemoration of his parents and later arranged the separation of Winlaton and Blaydon, diminishing his own income to provide the endowment of the former. For many years he was chaplain to Earl Grey. He married twice: first, at Alnwick on 7 July 1810, Frances Wilkie, only child of Henry Collingwood Selby of Swansfield, Northumberland. She died childless in 1811, and on 7 October 1817 Thorp married, at Little Ouseburn, Yorkshire, Mary, daughter of Edmund Robinson of Thorp Green, with whom he had a son, Charles Thorp (<i>d</i>. 1880), later vicar of Ellingham, and five surviving daughters. Four of the daughters married clergymen, two of whom were Durham graduates.<br>
<br>At Ryton, Thorp helped establish the first savings bank in the north of England, and in 1818 he delivered a sermon to a Gateshead friendly society which led to the formation of a successful savings bank at Newcastle. The sermon, which contained statistical information, was published as <span class="italic">Economy, a Duty of Natural and Revealed Religion</span> (1818). In 1829 he was presented to the second prebendal stall in Durham Cathedral, and in December 1831 he was appointed archdeacon of Durham, declining the living of Easington which was thereupon detached from the archdeaconry. He served on the royal commission to inquire into ecclesiastical revenues and patronage in 1832&#150;5, as a representative of capitular interests. As prolocutor of York convocation Thorp led a long and acrimonious struggle to secure the restoration to that body of the right to debate church affairs, finally succeeding in 1861. He was the author of many published sermons and charges; some, dealing with the duties of parochial clergy, were printed and circulated at his own expense and enjoyed wide popularity. Thorp was elected FRS in 1839. He was interested in natural history, being active in protecting the birds of the Farne Islands from egg collectors, whom he abhorred. He was a keen bibliophile and patron of the arts with a valuable gallery of ancient and modern masters, including copies by Verrio, commissioned by William III, of Raphael's cartoons at Hampton Court, of which he was particularly proud.<br>
<br>The great achievement of Thorp's life, for which he has never received full credit, was the founding of Durham University in 1832. If not the sole projector he was, with Bishop Van Mildert, the prime mover in its establishment. Both feared the Church of England to be in imminent danger of attack once the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832 was passed and they sought to retain its extraordinary wealth in Durham. A university there would pre-empt a mooted &#145;infidel&#146; college in Newcastle upon Tyne and benefit the Anglican cause. Bishop and chapter made considerable financial sacrifices, and the first students were admitted in October 1833 with Thorp as warden and master of University College. Thorp had ambitions to become dean of Durham, and when the deanery fell vacant in 1840 some of his colleagues unsuccessfully petitioned Melbourne to that effect on the grounds that if future deans were to be wardens of the university when Thorp vacated the post then he as incumbent warden ought to be made dean.<br>
<br>Modelled to some extent on Christ Church, Oxford, with dean and chapter as governors, and pioneering the external examining system to maintain Oxford standards for its degrees, the university initially flourished, providing under Henry Jenkyns a better theological training than was available elsewhere. Teaching expanded to include civil engineering in 1837 and the medical school in Newcastle became affiliated in 1852. At its peak the university had one college and two halls of residence in Durham and another in Newcastle. However, its Anglican ethos, while ensuring that 90 per cent of Durham students became clergymen, deterred members of other denominations. As the city of Durham, bypassed by the railway, became ringed by coal pits and coke ovens the university entered a period of decline. Thorp, who could not endure criticism of his beloved university, failed to perceive the need for reform, and despite advancing years and ill health was unwilling to delegate responsibility to colleagues. The consequence was a statutory commission of inquiry, set up in 1862, which found severe faults in management. Too ill to give evidence, Thorp finally offered to retire on a pension and was in the process of resigning his wardenship when he died at Ryton rectory on 10 October 1862. He was buried in the family vault at Ryton church on the 15th. His wife died in 1879.<br>
