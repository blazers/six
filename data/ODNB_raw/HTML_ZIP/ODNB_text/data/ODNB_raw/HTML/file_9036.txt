<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Eyre, Sir  Robert</span>  (1666&#150;1735), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9037/', "Sir Samuel Eyre (bap. 1638, d. 1698)")</script> of Newhouse, Wiltshire, and Lincoln's Inn, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Francis Lucy, of the family of Charlecote in Warwickshire. Several generations of Eyres had been members of Lincoln's Inn, and both Robert's father and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9031/', "Sir Giles Eyre (d. 1695)")</script> were judges of king's bench. Robert likewise entered Lincoln's Inn in 1683, became a barrister in 1690, and followed the western circuit. The family had considerable interests in Salisbury, where in 1696 he succeeded Sir Giles as recorder. He subsequently served as MP for Salisbury from 1698 to 1710, and was one of the country (or &#145;whimsical&#146;) whigs who sponsored the place clause of the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in January 1706; ultimately, however, he became known as one of the moderate whigs associated with the lord treasurer Godolphin. As such he shared in the promotion of the Marlborough&#150;Godolphin faction in government, becoming queen's counsel in May 1707 and solicitor-general in October 1708.<br>
<br>Although he had argued against impeaching Dr Henry Sacheverell, Eyre was a manager of the doctor's trial in 1710, speaking to the Commons' first article (charging Sacheverell with impugning the legitimacy of the revolution by asserting the high-church doctrine of non-resistance) and effectively undermining the defendant's answer. Like his fellow manager Sir Thomas Parker, who was subsequently made lord chief justice, he made a good impression at the trial, and when a second judicial vacancy occurred in the court of queen's bench, the most politically sensitive of the common law courts, the whigs were able to recommend him to it. Having been knighted a week earlier, Eyre replaced Sir Henry Gould as puisne justice on 13 May 1710, in the dying days of the administration, and over the next four years of tory rule he acted with Parker to sustain the whig interest in cases which related to the parliamentary corporations and the press.<br>
<br>This party service was the main foundation of Eyre's future promotion, and at the accession of George I he was reappointed to the bench and made chancellor to the prince of Wales, with a patent allowing him to advise the prince and take fees in spite of his judicial place. But in 1718, when the breach between the prince and the king resulted in legal questions about prerogative power over the education and marriage of the royal children, Eyre was one of two judges who gave opinions in favour of the prince regarding their education. Thereafter doubts about his political reliability rendered him ineligible for the chief justiceship of king's bench, and in 1718 he was passed over in favour of his junior, Pratt. Instead he was made lord chief baron of exchequer, on 21 November 1723, following pressure from the prince: &#145;a Situation, where by his great skill in the law he might be of great service to the king, and could not possibly do any hurt of any kind&#146;  (Newcastle to Townshend, 1 Nov 1723, BL, Add. MS 32686, fols. 385&#150;6). In 1725 he became lord chief justice of common pleas upon Sir Peter King's promotion to the woolsack, and presided for ten years in that court. Despite his acknowledged legal ability, Eyre was not immune from the charges of corruption which embroiled the Walpole regime, and in 1729&#150;30 he was one of the judges suspected of &#145;screening&#146; the prison gaolers who were being investigated by the House of Commons committee of inquiry into the state of prisons. Although Eyre was singled out as a primary target, being accused of collusion with Thomas Bambridge, the warden of the Fleet prison, before presiding at his trial, he was defended by the government and ultimately exonerated by the committee. He died on 28 December 1735 and was buried in St Thomas's Church, Salisbury, on 7 January 1736. With his wife, Elizabeth, who was the daughter of Edward Rudge of Warley Place, Essex, and who had died in 1724, he had three sons and a daughter.<br>
