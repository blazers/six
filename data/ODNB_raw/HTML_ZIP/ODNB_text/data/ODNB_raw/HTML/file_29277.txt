<span class="headword">White,  Walter</span>  (1811&#150;1893), <span class="occ">librarian and writer</span>, was born at Reading on 23 April 1811, the eldest son in the numerous family of John White (1779&#150;1863), upholsterer and cabinet-maker. He was educated at two local private schools, one of which was kept by Joseph Huntly, father of the founder of Huntly and Palmer's biscuit manufactory. At fourteen White left school to work alongside his father, spending much of his leisure in reading and in the study of French, German, and Latin. In 1830 he went to Derbyshire and Staffordshire, where he married Maria Hamilton; they raised a daughter and three sons. The family settled briefly at Reading, but in hopes of a better life sailed for the United States in April 1834. White plied his trade in New York and Poughkeepsie but without improving his circumstances, finding the cold winters hard to endure. His daughter died during this time. His account of the emigrant's life, &#145;A working man's recollections of America&#146;, was published in the first volume of <span class="italic">Knight's Penny Magazine</span> in 1846.<br>
<br>The family returned to Reading in May 1839 where White rejoined his father's business, but in October 1842, still tempted by prospects of a better life elsewhere, he left his family in Reading and went to London. He took employment as secretary to Joseph Mainzer, a music teacher, and accompanied Mainzer to Edinburgh when the latter was a candidate for the chair of music at the university. While in Edinburgh he met a variety of learned and self-educated men, visited libraries and attended lectures, including those delivered to the working classes by James Simpson. Simpson wrote him a glowing letter of introduction to Charles Weld, assistant secretary to the Royal Society, then located at Somerset House, Westminster, who offered him the post of attendant in the society's library.<br>
<br>White started work there on 19 April 1844 at an annual salary of &pound;80, his first task being to check the library shelves, which revealed many missing books. From there he became involved in the process of cataloguing and in 1858 he directed the boys hired to compile a catalogue of contents of all natural science periodicals in the library. This volume was published in 1867, the first of the series which eventually covered the century from 1800 to 1900. The boys employed on this lengthy task included Henry White (<i>d</i>. 1880), a distant relative, and one of White's own sons, Alfred Hastings White. When Weld resigned in 1861 White was promoted to assistant secretary at a salary of &pound;300 and entitled to lodgings at Somerset House. He was increasingly employed to service and take minutes for the society's various committees, and became acquainted with the many eminent men who attended and who lectured at the society.<br>
<br>At the end of 1845 White's wife left him and he was obliged to dispose of the family house in the Old Kent Road. Only his eldest son remained with him; another son, Henry, became a sailor. During this time White wrote extensively for <span class="italic">Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</span>&#151;some 200 articles between 1844 and 1849&#151;and for other serials. In 1850 he began the holiday walks which furnished new material: the narrative of his first month's excursion in Holland was published as &#145;Notes from the Netherlands&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chambers's Edinburgh Journal</span>, 15, 1858), but later expeditions, to Mont Blanc, the Tyrol, eastern Germany, and Bohemia, and, closer to home, Northumberland, Yorkshire, Shropshire, and London, were published as books. Age and ill health obliged him to resign at the end of 1884. In gratitude for his long continued and valuable service he was granted a life pension of &pound;350, equivalent to his current salary. He lived at 18 Grove Road, Lambeth, London, until his death there on 21 July 1893.<br>
