<span class="headword">Chapple,  Francis Joseph <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>, Baron Chapple  (1921&#150;2004), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born at 90 St Johns Road, Shoreditch, London, on 8 August 1921, the only son of Francis (Frank) Chapple, boot and shoe repairer, and his wife, Emma Gertrude, daughter of Joseph Rook, of Hoxton. His birthplace was a flat above his father's shop; the family later moved to Pitfield Street, Hoxton, where again they lived above the father's shop. Chapple senior was illiterate, and in his own son's graphic and unashamed description &#145;a bit of a villain&#146;  (personal knowledge). Indeed the relationship between Frank senior and Frank junior was at best tentative and often non-existent. It was his mother, Emma, who was, and remained, his guiding influence. She was a self-educated, highly intelligent woman, ambitious for her son&#151;there was also a daughter, Emily&#151;and came from a family of moderately successful greengrocers in Hoxton, where she also worked. Indeed it was Chapple's mother and her family of hardworking greengrocers who did much to support the precarious household, financially as well as emotionally, and to nurture the young Frank and his sister. Emma Chapple was a Conservative voter who ridiculed her husband's professed socialism. Perhaps in later years Frank Chapple's political swing from the communist left to the far right of Labour was, in part, a reflection of that early domestic conflict and, especially, maternal influence. The family conflicts of his childhood probably had a significant psychological bearing on Chapple's later development.<br>
<br>The family's living conditions were almost Dickensian. In the rooms above his father's shoe repair shop there was no bath or hot running water. In common with other working-class families in that area of London, bordering on the City and the East End, the Chapples used public baths to maintain personal hygiene and in later years Chapple claimed that he did not have a properly plumbed bath at home until after the Second World War. It was a very tough start for the lad who was first to become an active and dedicated communist and later to turn against his former comrades and become, if not a defender of the establishment, then certainly a crusader against communism.<br>
<br>Chapple left school at fourteen and his first, short-lived, job was as an errand boy with a local electrical firm. It was by pure chance that he was then taken on as an unindentured apprentice electrician with a firm that was working on wiring up his family's greengrocer's shop, where his mother still worked. Chapple's political senses were sharpened by his involvement in the anti-fascist battles against Sir Oswald Mosley's blackshirts as they rampaged against the East End Jewish community. Chapple was not Jewish, but his dark, swarthy stockiness sometimes gave that impression, and at his local elementary school he was frequently mistaken for a Jew and suffered antisemitic racial gibes. This certainly influenced his intense loathing of racial prejudice. At the age of sixteen, and steered by peer pressure in his electrician's job, he joined a trade union&#151;which in the 1930s was no simple task because high unemployment meant that most skilled unions placed restrictive limits on their membership. After several attempts he was finally accepted by the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) and recruited into its Islington branch, then run by active Communist Party members. The young Chapple had already joined the Labour League of Youth in Shoreditch, where he was befriended by a young socialist writer, Ted Willis, who was the national chairman of the Labour League of Youth and who came to play an important and influential role in Chapple's political life. It was Willis, having broken with the Labour Party's youth section over Labour's failure robustly to oppose Mosley's fascists, who then switched to the Young Communists and took Chapple and an entire section of the Labour League of Youth with him. Chapple remained an active member of the Communist Party for the next twenty years.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War, Chapple, as a skilled electrician, was recruited for work in the Royal Ordnance factories&#151;where he encountered his first strike. He desperately wanted to join the army and move out of a protected occupation, but it was not until 1943 that he succeeded in enlisting, joining the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Very soon he was in training for the Normandy landings of June 1944. Shortly before, on 31 May 1944, he married Joan Jeannette Nicholls, the 21-year-old daughter of James Nicholls, builder, of Hoxton; they were to have two sons, Roger (<i>b</i>. 1947) and Barry (<i>b</i>. 1951). On D-day plus twenty Chapple landed in France, where he was involved in tank maintenance. His war record carried a characteristic humorous touch&#151;he was mentioned in dispatches, as he would for ever confess with a modest wave of the arm, because he was on hand to repair his brigadier's car, which kept breaking down when under fire. &#145;Keeping my commanding officer mobile as we advanced toward the Rhine&#146;, Chapple would modestly explain with a grin, &#145;made me a hero!&#146;  (personal knowledge). Yet Chapple's war service did not weaken his resolve as a communist. Once in Germany as part of the occupying army he immediately established contact with the emerging West German Communist Party, helping to run a secret party cell from the army's education unit at L&uuml;beck. Demobilized in 1947 but without work for some time, he resumed activities with the ETU and was rewarded by the union's communist hierarchy with a trip to Prague as one of the union's representatives at the conference of the World Federation of Communist Youth.<br>
<br>It was in Prague that Chapple met the man who, eventually, would help transform his life, and his politics&#151;another young communist electrical worker named <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51589/', "Leslie Cannon")</script>. Neither of them realized it at the time, but their Prague meeting was to form the basis of experiences which not only changed both their lives but also, without overstating the case, arguably helped to influence the future shape of British trade unionism. In their separate ways Chapple and Cannon, both having become full-time officials of the ETU, grew increasingly disillusioned with the communist leadership of this important and influential union. Both began to suspect ballot rigging at the highest level, and both found that even their questioning, let alone criticism, was deeply resented by the ETU hierarchy. Their dramatic break with that hierarchy, in 1958, made national newspaper headlines. The first move was the result of Cannon's bid for a senior job in the union as head of the ETU education college. He was appointed to that job&#151;then quickly sacked by the union's leaders for his critical stand against the communist leadership. This was followed by Chapple's resignation from the Communist Party, his immediate switch to the Labour Party, and his winning a seat on the union's executive council. The two rebels were acting quite separately, but the ETU's communist leaders saw them as a combined threat. Even so it should be emphasized that the two men were quite different characters. Cannon was the more strategic thinker, autocratic, and a touch humourless; Chapple far more impulsive, quarrelsome, and by his own admission &#145;an awkward bugger&#146;  (personal knowledge). Both had critics even among their political allies. Chapple's &#145;cheekie chappie&#146; persona often infuriated his friends. Cannon's superior style invited similar displeasure. Yet their courage was undeniable. Together they led a reform group inside the union, aiming to remove the communist leadership, and in 1959 supported a well-known Catholic anti-communist, the Scottish area official Jock Byrne, in a challenge to the sitting general secretary, the communist Frank Haxell. It was a furious, bitter contest that Haxell claimed to have won. The result was then the subject of a High Court case, promoted by Cannon and Chapple, and presided over by Sir Rodger Winn, who, in a historic judgment of June 1961, found conspiracy to defraud by five communist leaders of the ETU&#151;arguably the most damaging indictment of trade union behaviour handed down by an English court.<br>
<br>After that momentous ruling Byrne became ETU general secretary and in 1963 Cannon was elected union president with Chapple as Byrne's deputy until 1966, when he succeeded Byrne as general secretary. Cannon and Chapple then ran the ETU for several years, in harness, until Cannon died of cancer in 1970. Chapple was then elected to succeed him as president and for a time occupied both that role and that of general secretary until he persuaded the union's executive to merge the two positions. From 1966 until 1970 he was also the ETU's representative on the Labour Party executive&#151;and a constant critic of Harold Wilson's government, notably opposing the government's incomes policy. In 1971 he moved across from the party executive to join the TUC general council, where he cemented his reputation as an irritant and critic of most other union leaders. He even quarrelled publicly with two TUC general secretaries, Vic Feather and then Len Murray. It was as though, having abandoned his collectivist beliefs, Chapple found it temperamentally very difficult to establish any new alliances. When the Heath government came to office in 1970 he opposed its wages policies as vehemently as he had opposed the Wilson government. Nor did anything change when Wilson returned to Downing Street in 1974 after the miners' crisis of that winter. Indeed he also opposed the Labour government's &#145;social contract&#146; in 1975 because it contained further wage restraint. Throughout this time Chapple continued his fight for trade unions to bargain without restraint regardless of political embarrassment to the Labour Party&#151;a populist role that often left him isolated among his fellow union leaders, though much admired by his members.<br>
<br>In 1981 Chapple chose to become a founder signatory of the Limehouse declaration, which created the breakaway Social Democratic Party, and although he never joined the SDP he actively supported its policies and some of its parliamentary candidates. Many of his TUC colleagues wanted him&#151;and his union&#151;expelled from the Trades Union Congress, and voted him off senior committees. But under the influence of the general secretary, Len Murray, who pleaded for tolerance, Chapple was reinstated and the TUC leaders grudgingly accepted his seniority on the general council by allowing him to occupy his scheduled role as TUC president at the 1983 congress. Not that this softened Chapple's attitude towards his critics: he used his presidential speech to accuse fellow TUC leaders of &#145;self-inflicted absurdities&#146; and &#145;infantile&#146; threats to the elected government, in an extraordinary swipe at virtually everything and everybody  (<span class="italic">Report of 115th Annual Trades Union Congress</span>, 1983, 360&#150;61). It was Chapple at his irrepressible best&#151;or worst.<br>
<br>Chapple retired from his union in 1984 and Margaret Thatcher, with whom he had established a friendly&#151;even warm&#151;accord, made him a life peer in the new year's honours list of 1985. His retirement years were mostly devoted to a lifelong hobby of breeding racing pigeons, reading history and literature&#151;he could quote extensively from Shelley&#151;and listening to classical music. He continued to serve on a number of boards, including the Horse Race Totalisator Board (1976&#150;90), the National Nuclear Corporation (1980&#150;86), Southern Water Authority (1983&#150;9), Inner City Enterprises (1983&#150;8), and the N. G. Bailey Organisation (1989&#150;99). He had been a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution (1973&#150;7), the National Economic Development Council (1979&#150;83), and several other bodies. In 1984 he published his autobiography, <span class="italic">Sparks Fly! a Trade Union Life</span>, the writing of which was largely attributed to John Grant, MP for Islington, whom Chapple supported when Grant left the Labour Party and switched to the SDP. Chapple's first wife died in 1994 after a marriage lasting fifty years. He married on 26 October 1999 Phyllis Mary Jenner, a 65-year-old widow, and daughter of Wilfred Luck, wharf manager. He died on 20 October 2004 at Maidstone Hospital, Maidstone, Kent, of a duodenal ulcer, and was survived by his second wife, Phyllis, and the two sons of his first marriage.<br>
