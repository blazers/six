<span class="headword">Higgins,  Henry Bournes</span>  (1851&#150;1929), <span class="occ">politician and judge in Australia</span>, was born on 30 June 1851 at Newtownards, co. Down, Ireland, the second of the nine children of John Higgins (1820&#150;1895), a Wesleyan preacher, and his wife, Anne (1825&#150;1917), the daughter of Henry Bournes of Crossmolina, co. Mayo. He grew up in a close-knit family in an atmosphere of evangelical piety and genteel frugality. Deemed a &#145;delicate&#146; child and inhibited by a bad stammer, he was sent to the Wesleyan connexional school in Dublin at the age of ten, but ill health forced his withdrawal four years later. His mother helped him with his education at home, and he resumed his studies for a short time at a local school in Newry. His first job was in a drapery warehouse in Belfast, a city he disliked; later he found more satisfactory employment in a furniture warehouse in Dublin.<br>
<br>When, in 1869, Henry's elder brother, James, died from consumption, John and Anne Higgins revived earlier thoughts of emigration. A doctor recommended Victoria for its healthy climate, and in 1870 the family settled in Melbourne, where Higgins was able to combine work as a teacher with study for university matriculation. During a successful academic career at Melbourne University (LLB, 1874; MA, 1876) he continued to contribute to the support of the family, teaching and tutoring. In engaging with the great intellectual issues of the day he discarded the simple Wesleyanism of his father, and came close to agnosticism.<br>
<br>Having, with the help of an elocution teacher, overcome his stammer, Higgins went to the bar in 1876, though he chose equity, as it would not require him to address juries. By 1887 he had graduated to the leadership of the equity bar. On 19 December 1885 he married Mary Alice (<i>d</i>. 1944), the daughter of Dr George Morrison, then principal of Geelong College, and sister of George Ernest &#145;Chinese&#146; Morrison. In 1887 Mary Alice gave birth to their only child, Mervyn Bournes.<br>
<br>With his career established, Higgins turned to public affairs. He always retained a strong interest in Irish affairs and became a supporter of home rule; in 1883 he made perhaps his first appearance on a public platform in support of the visiting nationalists John and William Redmond, and in 1887 he was prominent in a protest against the <span class="roman">Irish Coercion Bill</span>. In 1892 he stood unsuccessfully for Geelong for the Victorian legislative assembly, but two years later he was elected. Wishing to identify himself with the liberal interest, he found it necessary to put aside his free-trade convictions and accept the dominant policy of tariff protection which was associated with the progressive cause in Victoria.<br>
<br>Higgins entered parliament at a time of severe economic depression when Australia's claim to be &#145;a working man's paradise&#146; was no longer plausible. It was in this context that Liberals, Higgins among them, addressed &#145;the social problem&#146;. Notable among the social reforms introduced in Victoria which he supported was the <span class="roman">Factories and Shops Act</span> of 1896, which pioneered wage regulation in a number of sweated trades. The economic plight of the colonies, and Victoria in particular, also turned attention to proposals for federation, and in 1897 Higgins was elected as one of ten Victorian delegates to the Australasian federal convention of 1897&#150;8. As a lawyer and political radical he made a significant contribution to the proceedings of the convention, in particular moving the amendment which was to give the commonwealth a limited power for the conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes. Nevertheless Higgins opposed the draft constitution when it was put before the people: he saw no justification for the senate being &#145;a states' house&#146;, and he feared that Australia would be saddled with a rigid constitution which would resist modernization.<br>
<br>In Victoria, which had strongly supported federation, Higgins's position was not a popular one. His opposition in 1899 to the sending of the Victorian contingent to the South African War further served to characterize him as a perverse radical. Although he was a supporter of the empire and looked forward to Ireland achieving the independence already enjoyed by the self-governing colonies, Higgins distrusted the imperial sentiment which he saw as being deployed to excuse Victoria from making its own assessment of the war. In the wake of these heresies, Higgins lost his seat in 1900 after a bitter and divisive campaign.<br>
<br>As a radical, however, Higgins had found favour with the labour movement, and at the first federal elections of 1901 he was elected for the predominantly working-class electorate of North Melbourne. Although generally a supporter of his colleague and friend the liberal Protectionist Alfred Deakin, Higgins continued to follow his own path, reluctantly joining with the Labor Party to defeat the Deakin government in 1904 when he considered its legislation for industrial arbitration inadequate. Higgins, although not a member of the Labor Party, served as attorney-general in the short-lived Watson Labor government which followed. While he did not see himself as a socialist, he was critical of what he called the &#145;bourgeois principle&#146; and sympathetic to Labor's political ambitions. In 1905 he moved the resolution in the commonwealth parliament which urged Britain to grant Ireland home rule.<br>
<br>In 1906 Deakin appointed Higgins to the high court, with the added responsibility of taking over the presidency of the arbitration court from 1907. In the latter role Higgins was to become a national figure. In his first case he had to decide whether the manufacturer H. V. McKay was paying the &#145;fair and reasonable&#146; wages to his employees required by the new protection legislation. In the &#145;Harvester judgment&#146; (1907) Higgins ignored the dictates of the market and spelt out the rights of the worker &#145;as a human being in a civilized community&#146;, entitled to marry and raise a family. Popular at first with trade unions, the arbitration court had difficulty dealing with the industrial strife which erupted during and immediately after the First World War. Higgins himself was increasingly at odds with the Nationalist government led by W. M. Hughes and resigned the presidency in 1921. The following year he published his apologia, <span class="italic">A New Province for Law and Order</span>. However, the social ethos which he espoused as the justification of wage regulation played a large part in establishing the international reputation of Australia and New Zealand as &#145;a social laboratory for the world&#146;. And although in the 1920s it might have seemed that industrial arbitration had lost much of Higgins's Promethean mission, the court long remained a powerful institution often seen as expressive of Australian egalitarian values, only recently challenged by the proponents of economic rationalism. Higgins remained on the high court until his death in 1929. In interpreting the constitution he sought to minimize the court's interventionist role, effectively supporting the extension of commonwealth power at the expense of the states.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Higgins maintained a strong attachment to the English heritage, and sent Mervyn to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1906; yet he was also interested in the development of Australian culture. In England at the time of the outbreak of the First World War, he supported the British cause, and, visiting Ireland, was encouraged by the evidence of loyalty there. He was disturbed, however, by the jingoism engendered by the imperial cause, and the war brought a personal anguish in 1916 with the death of Mervyn at Magdhaba, Egypt. Severed, as it were, from the future of Australia, Higgins's interest in Ireland intensified. Although a supporter of the Irish nationalists, he nevertheless urged John Dillon not to close the door on Sinn F&eacute;in. In 1924 he revisited Ireland, expressing particular interest in its cultural revival; his meeting with the poet &#145;A. E.&#146; (George Russell) was instrumental in Higgins leaving a &pound;20,000 bequest to the Royal Irish Academy to support the study of Irish culture.<br>
<br>Higgins collapsed and died on 13 January 1929 at his country house, Heronswood, Dromana. The conservative Melbourne <span class="italic">Argus</span> hailed him as &#145;a great Australian&#146;, while the Trades Hall flew the Australian flag at half mast. He was buried two days later in Dromana cemetery, with Anglican rites, under the Celtic cross which he had built to commemorate his son.<br>
