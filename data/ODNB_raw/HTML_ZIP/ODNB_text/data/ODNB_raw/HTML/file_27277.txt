<span class="headword">Thompson,  Theophilus</span>  (1807&#150;1860), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of Nathaniel Thompson, was born in Islington, London, on 20 September 1807. His early medical education took place at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and at Edinburgh University, where he took his MD in 1830, his inaugural dissertation being &#145;De effectibus aliquando perniciosis missionis sanguinis&#146;. He also studied in Dublin and then in Paris with Louis, G. Andral, and G. Dupuytren, and he attended the lectures of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire at the Jardin des Plantes.<br>
<br>Soon after settling down to practise in London, Thompson was appointed physician to the Northern Dispensary, a position he held for fourteen years. He was also one of the lecturers at the Grosvenor Place school of medicine. In 1847 he was elected physician to the Hospital for Consumption, then situated in Marlborough Street; it was here that he began to take an interest in consumption. He gave several lectures on the disease, which were later published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. He is credited with being the person who introduced cod-liver oil into England, and was the first to give bismuth to arrest the diarrhoea of phthisis, and to treat night sweats with oxide of zinc.<br>
<br>Thompson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1846, and he published two papers in the society's <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> on the changes produced in the blood by the administration of cod-liver oil and coconut oil. He filled the presidential chairs of the Medical and Harveian societies, and contributed five papers to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He married Elizabeth Anna Maria, the second daughter of Nathaniel Watkin of Stroud, Gloucestershire. They had at least two sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36398/', "Edmund Symes-Thompson (1837&#150;1906)")</script> was also a physician.<br>
<br>Thompson was the author of: <span class="italic">On the Improvement of Medicine</span> (1838), an oration; <span class="italic">History of the Epidemics of Influenza in Great Britain from 1510 to 1837</span> (Sydenham Society, 1852); <span class="italic">Clinical Lectures on Pulmonary Consumption</span> (1854); and <span class="italic">Lettsomian Lectures on Pulmonary Consumption</span>. He also contributed the articles &#145;Chorea&#146;, &#145;Hysteria&#146;, &#145;Neuralgia&#146;, and &#145;Influenza&#146; to Alexander Tweedie's <span class="italic">Library of Medicine</span> (1840&#150;42).<br>
<br>Thompson died on 11 August 1860 at Vale Lodge, Sutton, Surrey. He was survived by his wife.<br>
