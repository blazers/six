<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cunningham family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1340&#150;1631), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was probably descended from vassals of the Moreville family, which in the twelfth century held extensive estates in Cunningham in north Ayrshire. Cunningham became a Stewart lordship under King Robert I. The first prominent member of the Cunningham family was <a name="cosubject_54162"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Cunningham</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1396<span class="mult">x</span>9)<span class="occ"></span>, whose father was a cousin of Robert I (the precise relationship is not clear), and who was himself twice addressed by David II in charters as <i>consanguineus</i>. Sir William's earliest recorded appearance is on a list of cautioners appointed in parliament in 1344 to ensure that the kindred of the late Alexander Ramsay would not harm his killer, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale. In 1351 Cunningham was sheriff of Lanark, and his eldest son, Robert (who predeceased him), became a hostage for the ransom of David II in 1357. About 1361, possibly as compensation for this, or in recognition of some obscure hereditary claim, or as a counterbalance to Stewart power in the south-west, Sir William received a royal grant of the lands of the earldom of Carrick. Subsequently he was known as lord, rather than earl, of Carrick, and held the lands until 1368, when the earldom was granted to the king's nephew John Stewart (later King Robert III), on his marriage to Annabella Drummond. Sir William's principal estate was Kilmaurs, north-west of Kilmarnock, in Cunningham, and he also held the nearby lands of Lambroughton, Kilbride, and Skelmorlie, as well as Ranfurly in mid-Renfrewshire and Polquhairn in Kyle. He was also sheriff of Ayr, and the family was thus well placed to take advantage of the power vacuum left when the Stewarts ascended the throne of Scotland in 1371. All that is known of his wife, Margaret, is her forename.<br>
<br>On Sir William's death he was succeeded by his second son, <a name="cosubject_54163"></a><span class="headword">Sir William Cunningham of Kilmaurs</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1413<span class="mult">x</span>15)<span class="occ"></span>. He too was sheriff of Ayr. In 1384 (by which time he had been knighted) he and his retinue helped to defeat an English force which had landed at South Queensferry, on the southern shore of the Forth. Through his marriage to Margaret, one of the coheirs of the Renfrewshire family of Danielston of that ilk, the younger Sir William acquired further lands in Cunningham and elsewhere in Scotland, notably in Glencairn in western Dumfriesshire, from which the family was later to take its peerage title as earls of Glencairn. Sir William may also have been married later to Mary Stewart, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23714/', "Robert III")</script> and widow of James Kennedy of Dunure in Carrick.<br>
<br>Sir William died between August 1413 and December 1415, and was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54164"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Cunningham of Kilmaurs</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1430/31)<span class="occ"></span>, who was one of the Scottish lords who met King James I at Durham as hostage for his deliverance from English captivity in 1424. Robert was knighted at the king's coronation later that year, and was a member of the assize which convicted Murdoch Stewart, duke of Albany, and others of his family of treason at Stirling in May 1425. He was also one of four lords subsequently commissioned to lead a force to crush a rebellion led by James Stewart, a younger son of Duke Murdoch. Another leader was Sir John Montgomery of Eaglesham, whose daughter, Anne, Robert Cunningham contracted to marry on 6 June 1425. With his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19051/', "Sir Alexander Montgomery of Ardrossan")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54294/', "Montgomery family")</script>], Sir Robert was in 1430 appointed joint keeper of Kintyre and Knapdale in Argyll, with custody of castles Sween and Skipness, as part of a campaign to assert royal control over the territories of the lordship of the Isles. But he seems to have been dead by 4 February 1431, and was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_6912"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Cunningham</span>, first earl of Glencairn  (1426?&#150;1488)<span class="occ"></span>, who must have been still only a child.<br>
<br>Following Sir Robert's death, the office of bailie of Cunningham, which he had been given for life under the terms of the 1425 marriage contract, reverted to Sir Alexander Montgomery. However, when in 1449 James II granted the office heritably to Montgomery's son Alexander, this gave rise to an often murderous feud which was not finally settled until 1609. But arbitration in 1454&#150;5 led to an agreement that Alexander Cunningham of Kilmaurs would act as bailie until Lord Montgomery's grandson, now his heir, reached his majority, and since Cunningham accounted at the exchequer in 1457 and 1458, this had obviously taken effect. He was in favour with James II, having supported him against the ninth earl of Douglas in 1455 (the Montgomerys, by contrast, were very probably Douglas supporters), and became a lord of parliament between 8 February 1463 and 13 January 1464 as Lord Kilmaurs, sitting in every parliament between then and 1488. He married Margaret, daughter of Adam Hepburn, second Lord Hailes. In 1464 he had to defend himself against a&#151;surprising&#151;charge of rendering assistance to the exiled Douglases. His defence, for which he offered to undergo three alternative modes of proof (an assize, compurgation, or combat), was successful. In 1466 he was confronted with the service of Alexander Montgomery as heir to his father in the office of bailie of Cunningham; it seems clear from the fact that the service occurred before sheriffs <i>in hac parte</i> at Linlithgow, rather than in Cunningham, that Kilmaurs was hostile to any reversion of the office to the Montgomerys. There is no evidence to show how the office was exercised between 1466 and 1470 (when Lord Montgomery died, having been predeceased by his grandson who left yet another minor heir, Hugh), or indeed in the 1470s. In 1481, however, the office was being exercised by John Ross of Montgreenan, king's advocate and a favourite of King James III; so it would seem that Kilmaurs had lost control of it.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, when Prince James rose against his father in 1488 Kilmaurs took the side of the king, perhaps stimulated by the presence in the prince's forces of Hugh, second Lord Montgomery. For assistance rendered to the king at Blackness Castle, Kilmaurs was on 28 May 1488 created earl of Glencairn. However, at the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488 the new earl was killed, possibly by Lord Montgomery. In October there was passed a parliamentary act rescinding all grants of new dignities by James III since 2 February 1488. The bailie of Cunningham was granted back to the Montgomery family by James IV in 1488 and was confirmed again in 1498. On 17 October 1488 the grant of the earldom was annulled by act of parliament, making all creations since 2 February 1488 void. Glencairn's eldest son, Robert Cunningham, second Lord Kilmaurs (<i>d</i>. 1489) held only the lordship of parliament, not the earldom, and sat in parliament in 1489 as such. He had married, some time before 19 July 1476, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1491&times;6), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54270/', "John Lindsay, first Lord Lindsay of the Byres (d. 1482)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54268/', "Lindsay family of the Byres (per. 1367&#150;1526)")</script>]. On his death, also at the hands of Lord Montgomery late in 1489, Robert was succeeded by his only son, <a name="cosubject_74469"></a><span class="headword">Cuthbert Cunningham</span>, second earl of Glencairn  (<em>c.</em>1470&#150;1540/41). When he was of age Cuthbert married, about 24 June 1492, Marion Douglas (<i>d</i>. in or after 1511), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7864/', "Archibald Douglas, fifth earl of Angus (c.1449&#150;1513)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth. The marriage helped to secure his family's position and the earldom of Glencairn was revived in his favour on 15 August 1503, on the occasion of James's marriage to Margaret Tudor. Cuthbert aided the attempt of John Stewart, twelfth earl of Lennox, to liberate James V from the Douglases and was wounded fighting in this cause at Linlithgow on 4 September 1526, when Lennox was killed. For most of Glencairn's lifetime the Cunninghams were at feud with the Montgomerys, vying for jurisdictional control of the Cunningham bailiary. Cuthbert's son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6935/', "William Cunningham, master and later third earl of Glencairn (d. 1548)")</script>, burnt Eglinton Castle, the principal seat of the Montgomerys, in 1528, but the feud was eventually, if only temporarily, pacified in 1536. Cuthbert had died by May 1541.<br>
<br>William Cunningham, the third earl, married before 1509 Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1528&times;36), second daughter of William Borthwick, third Lord Borthwick. He was briefly treasurer in 1526 and after January 1536 he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Campbell of West Loudon. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Solway Moss in 1542. Ransomed shortly afterwards, he supported the English during the &#145;rough wooing&#146; until defeated by James Hamilton, second earl of Arran, outside Glasgow in May 1544. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6913/', "Alexander Cunningham, fourth earl of Glencairn (d. 1574/5)")</script>, was in matters of religion a prominent reformer and a supporter of the king's party during the Marian civil war. Although the Cunninghams broadly shared their chief's enthusiasm for protestant reform, they were less inclined to support his political activities. Only the laird of Cunninghamhead joined Glencairn in the so-called chaseabout raid of 1565, directed against Queen Mary's marriage to Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, while John Cunningham of Drumquhassill with other kinsmen held Dumbarton for the queen in 1568. Alexander was married first, about 1526, to Janet (Jane), daughter of James Hamilton, first earl of Arran, and then, after their divorce in 1545, to Jane (<i>d</i>. in or after 1575), daughter of Sir John Cunningham of Caprington.<br>
<br>Tensions between the Cunninghams and the Montgomerys resurfaced in 1571, when the fourth earl's son of his second marriage, Alexander Cunningham of Montgreenan, was appointed commendator of Kilwinning Abbey and contested the right of Hugh Montgomery, third earl of Eglinton, to act as bailie of the abbey's regality. However, <a name="cosubject_74470"></a><span class="headword">William Cunningham</span>, fifth earl of Glencairn  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1526, <em>d.</em> in or before 1580)<span class="occ"></span>, who was probably of age by 1547, showed little interest in his half-brother's dispute. He first attended the privy council in 1569, having married Janet (<i>d</i>. 1596), daughter of John Gordon of Lochinvar and his wife, Margaret, about 20 August 1547. He had died by 24 February 1580. In 1577 the Cunninghams were described as composed of &#145;men of fayre landes and of greate power of their owne surname&#146;  (Rodgers, 10) Their cadet branches included the lairds of Glengarnock, Cunninghamhead, Robertland, Aiket, Auchenharvie, Montgreenan, and Caprington, all in Ayrshire, although the earls of Glencairn also held lands in Renfrewshire, where their main seat at Finlaystone Castle lay near the River Clyde, and in Dumfriesshire and Dunbartonshire. The fifth earl's son, <a name="cosubject_74471"></a><span class="headword">James Cunningham</span>, sixth earl of Glencairn  (<em>c.</em>1552&#150;1630)<span class="occ"></span>, participated in the Ruthven raid in 1582, but soon lost confidence in the new government and after its demise was reconciled to the king. In 1585, however, a Cunningham died in an attack on a Montgomery church, and shortly afterwards James signed a band with other kinsmen agreeing to protect whomever would assassinate Hugh Montgomery, fourth earl of Eglinton. The young earl, riding from Langshaw Tower, was ambushed and killed by Cunningham horsemen on either 18 or 20 April 1586. The Montgomerys retaliated by raiding Cunningham lands in the Irvine valley. Of the known murderers the laird of Clonbeith and the heir of Corsehill were killed within two years, while Robertland fled to Denmark to escape retribution; the laird of Aiket was finally shot in 1602. Kilwinning, who was implicated in the conspiracy, was shot outside his house in 1591, precipitating further violence between the kindreds, though support for the feud among the Cunninghams was never universal.<br>
<br>The crown made repeated attempts to reconcile the families between 1595 and 1604. Then on 1 July 1606, while parliament was sitting in Perth, the earl of Glencairn and Sir Alexander Seton, master of Eglinton, passed on the high street in the evening and fighting broke out between their retinues, at the end of which one of Glencairn's servants lay dead. Following this disturbance the king renewed his efforts to end the feud and the parties finally submitted to a decreet arbitral of 16 March 1609. At its height the feud had undoubtedly caused real privation for some of the families of the participants, but any adverse consequences for the Cunningham kindred do not appear to have been lasting. Indeed the laird of Robertland's self-imposed exile proved prosperous, for in 1590 he returned to Scotland in the entourage of Anne of Denmark, to a knighthood and to the office of master stabler to the new queen. Glencairn himself was an active member of the privy council and acted as one of the commissioners in 1604 for the proposed union with England. He married, first, on 5 September 1574, Mariot or Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1610), daughter of Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and mother of the seventh earl, and second, before 14 July 1612, Agnes, daughter of Sir James Hay of Kingask; she was formerly married to someone called Preston. Glencairn died after May 1630 and was briefly succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_74472"></a><span class="headword">William Cunningham</span>, seventh earl of Glencairn  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1575, <em>d.</em> 1631)<span class="occ"></span>. William had married about 1609 Janet, daughter of Mark Kerr, first earl of Lothian, and mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6936/', "William Cunningham, eighth earl of Glencairn (1610/11&#150;1664)")</script>. He died in October 1631 and was buried with his ancestors in Kilmaurs parish church. His wife was still alive in 1647.<br>
