<span class="headword">Hobart,  George</span>, third earl of Buckinghamshire  (1731&#150;1804), <span class="occ">theatre manager and politician</span>, was born in London on 8 September 1731, the eldest of the two sons (there were no daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13393/', "John Hobart, later first earl of Buckinghamshire (1693&#150;1756)")</script>, and his second wife, Elizabeth Bristow (<i>bap</i>. 1694, <i>d</i>. 1762). He entered Westminster School in 1739 and was elected king's scholar in 1746. He does not seem to have attended university. In 1754 he was elected to one of the parliamentary seats in St Ives, Cornwall. On 16 May 1757 he married Albinia [<a name="cosubject_74209"></a><span class="headword">Albinia Hobart</span>, countess of Buckinghamshire  (1737/8&#150;1816)<span class="occ"></span>], the eldest of the two daughters of Lord Vere Bertie, the third son of Robert, first duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, and his wife, Ann Casey, the illegitimate daughter of Sir Cecil Wray, bt, and, through her, heir to estates in Ireland.<br>
<br>With the influence of the Hobart family diminishing in St Ives, Hobart was not returned there in 1761 but was instead elected for Bere Alston, Devon. His ambitions, however, lay in diplomatic service. He had applied for the position of British resident in Hamburg in 1756, and in August 1762 he accompanied his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13394/', "John Hobart, second earl of Buckinghamshire")</script>, to Russia as secretary to the embassy. The posting was unsuccessful: on 21 October 1762 Buckinghamshire wrote to his aunt Henrietta, countess of Suffolk, that the comfort-loving Hobart was &#145;a good deal out of spirits&#146;  (Buckinghamshire, 1.76) in the bleak surroundings of Moscow, and on 27 December he reported that Hobart was &#145;determin'd to ask leave to return to England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>, 171) and on 13 April 1763 that he was on the point of departure. He arrived in London in July 1763.<br>
<br>Hobart's diplomatic career was over, but a few years later he found a new direction as manager of the opera at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket. The opera had had aristocratic managers before, such as Charles Sackville, earl of Middlesex (later second duke of Dorset), for several years after 1741, but Hobart showed more application in running the opera as a viable business. He bought a controlling share in the opera patent between July and September 1769 and ran a programme containing both serious and comic operas. The main challenge of his tenure came at the beginning of 1771, when Theresa Cornelys added &#145;harmonic meetings&#146; to her assemblies at Carlisle House. The leading performer was a countertenor castrato, Gaetano Guadagni, who had been the leading countertenor at the King's Theatre until his resignation, prompted, according to Horace Walpole, by Hobart's promotion of Anna Maria Zamperini&#151;believed to be Hobart's mistress&#151;over Guadagni's sister. Hobart employed spies to gather evidence; Cornelys and Guadagni were brought to trial and both were fined. Hobart continued to work to vary the offerings at the King's Theatre, and at the beginning of the 1771&#150;2 season brought the dancer Anne-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique Heinel over from Paris to help raise the profile of dance. At the beginning of 1773 he retired from the opera, perhaps through financial strain, and sold at least some of his shares to the actor James Brooke.<br>
<br>Thereafter Hobart seems to have lived as a gentleman, having inherited the hall and estate at Nocton in Lincolnshire from a distant relative, Sir Richard Ellys, third baronet, when it was relinquished by Ellys's widow in 1766. He visited Paris in 1776 and 1779. It may have been during this period that he met Mary Ann Joseph Delibossart of Paris, possibly his mistress; she and her daughters Augusta Joseph Bezos and Seraphina Delibossart are mentioned in his will, as is Ann Barker, the wife of John Barker of Belgrave Square. He remained MP for Bere Alston until 1780, by which time his half-brother had sold his interest in Bere Alston to Hugh Percy, first duke of Northumberland. He does not seem to have sought another seat, and was probably content to leave the family's political affairs to his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13396/', "Robert Hobart, later fourth earl of Buckinghamshire")</script>. He maintained connections with the theatrical world; his daughter Albinia (1759&#150;1853) married Richard Cumberland, son of the playwright, in 1784, and he probably retained a financial interest in the King's Theatre. He was a member of the committee of mortgagees and creditors who petitioned the lord chamberlain in 1791 to allow a rebuilt King's Theatre to continue as an opera house when the patent, following the fire of 1789, had been allowed to migrate to the Pantheon.<br>
<br>However, by this time Hobart had been eclipsed as a public figure by his wife, Albinia. Leading a separate life from her husband, she became well known for her lavish assemblies and for her dramatic performances, which usually featured herself and her daughters, and were often staged at Nocton Hall or at the Hobarts' house on Ham Common. This was modelled on Frederick the Great's villa and named Sans-Souci after it. In 1784 she joined the campaign of her relative Sir Cecil Wray in the notorious Westminster election. She was not the highest in rank of the ladies who supported Wray, the ministerial candidate, nor even the most active, but her obese figure&#151;her appearance was likened to a beefsteak&#151;made her a target for satirists seeking a subject who could be contrasted with the Foxite whig campaigner and renowned beauty Georgiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire. She could also, like Wray, be charged with apostasy, as most of her social circle were supporters of Fox.<br>
<br>Hobart succeeded his half-brother as earl of Buckinghamshire on 3 September 1793, but did not inherit the family estates, which the second earl had divided among his daughters. The new countess, already infamous as a gambler, was reported as opening her house for faro games twice a week in order to raise the funds to maintain her new dignity. Charles Pigott, in <span class="italic">The Female Jockey Club</span>, attacked her as someone who, if she were not of a noble family, &#145;would in all probability have passed much of her time in the house of correction&#146;  (Pigott, 106), and affected to praise her theatrical productions on the grounds that they could cure the most intractable cases of insomnia. In March 1797, alongside Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, she was fined &pound;50 for illicit gambling.<br>
<br>Buckinghamshire, meanwhile, was happy to accept the additional honours and duties that became his rank. In 1797 he became colonel of the 3rd regiment of Lincolnshire militia, and on 12 January 1799 he was awarded the rank of colonel in the army for as long as his regiment should remain embodied for active service. He died on 14 November 1804 at Nocton, Lincolnshire, and was buried there. He was survived by his wife and by two of his five sons&#151;Robert, fourth earl of Buckinghamshire, and Henry Lewis (<i>bap</i>. 1774, <i>d</i>. 1845), dean of Windsor from 1816. Three other sons&#151;George (<i>bap</i>. 1758), George Vere (<i>bap</i>. 1764, <i>d</i>. 1802), governor of Grenada, and Charles (<i>bap</i>. 1766, <i>d</i>. 1782), a naval officer killed in action&#151;predeceased him. His eldest daughter, Albinia, was lady of the bedchamber to the daughters of George III from 1796 to 1812 and was the mother of the army officer Richard Francis George Cumberland; his twin daughters, Henrietta Anne Barbara (<i>bap</i>. 1762, <i>d</i>. 1828) and Maria Frances Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1762, <i>d</i>. 1794), married, respectively, the politician John Sullivan and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20308/', "George Augustus North, third earl of Guilford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20304/', "North, Frederick, second earl of Guilford")</script>]; and his youngest daughter, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1798), married Edward Disbrowe, an army officer, and was the mother of the diplomatist Sir Edward Disbrowe. Albinia, dowager countess of Buckinghamshire, died on 11 March 1816 at Nocton, Lincolnshire, and was buried there like her husband.<br>
