<span class="headword">Marshall,  (Charles) Arthur Bertram</span>  (1910&#150;1989), <span class="occ">humorist and broadcaster</span>, was born on 10 May 1910 in Barnes, Surrey, the younger son of Charles Frederick Bertram Marshall, consulting engineer, and his wife, Dorothy Lee. His father was a loving husband, but although he quite liked the idea of children, to Arthur's disappointment he preferred to be where they were not. In 1920 the family moved to Newbury, Berkshire, and Arthur was sent away to boarding-school. First he went to Edinburgh House, an uncomfortable but enjoyable preparatory school in Lee-on-Solent, Hampshire, and then to Oundle School in Northamptonshire. He was happy at Oundle&#151;he seems to have been happy almost everywhere&#151;and during a debate in his last winter term a great burst of laughter at something he said gave him such a whiff of power and pleasure that he decided to make the raising of laughter the prime consideration of his life. He then went to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a second class (second division) in part one of the modern and medieval languages tripos (French, 1929, and German, 1930) and a third class in part two (1931).<br>
<br>Marshall acted at every opportunity at Oundle and at Christ's and was determined on a career in the theatre. He mostly played female parts at university, for which he collected some excellent press notices, notably for his playing of Lady Cicely, opposite Michael Redgrave, in G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</span>. He became president of Cambridge's Amateur Dramatic Society.<br>
<br>Down from Cambridge, armed with his glowing press cuttings, Marshall had his heart set on going to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, but his mother pointed out that the acting profession would hardly give an ecstatic welcome to an amateur female impersonator. She persuaded him to go back to Oundle instead and make a career as a schoolmaster. In 1931 Oundle offered him a job as a house tutor and teacher of French and German, which he accepted, quaking in his shoes. To his own surprise he turned out to be a good teacher and, as the terms sped happily by, he spent a good deal of his free time writing and performing to friends what were then called &#145;turns&#146;, three-minute comic monologues in which, inspired by Angela Brazil's girls'-school stories which he found hilarious when read aloud, he impersonated hearty botany mistresses and stern school matrons.<br>
<br>In 1934 a BBC radio producer saw Marshall perform his botany mistress turn at a party and booked him to broadcast it on <span class="italic">Charlot's Hour</span>. Thus his professional career began by his becoming the world's first drag act on radio. In the same year Raymond Mortimer, literary editor of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, asked him to review a clutch of schoolgirl stories. His review was much enjoyed and for many years was a popular Christmas feature of the magazine.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Marshall, like many a schoolmaster, was drafted into intelligence; he had a busy time, surviving the evacuation of Dunkirk in the British expeditionary force and working with combined operations headquarters and Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force. In 1945 he was a lieutenant-colonel on General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff. He was appointed an MBE in 1944. In 1943, while still in uniform, he wrote and starred in a BBC comedy series on the radio, <span class="italic">A Date with Nurse Dugdale</span>, which was a wartime success.<br>
<br>After the war Marshall returned to Oundle in 1946 as a housemaster, but his fascination with the theatre was still strong and, afraid that he might end up as a rotund Mr Chips before his time, he left Oundle in 1954 at the age of forty-four and became a social secretary to his old friend Victor, third Baron Rothschild. In 1958 he changed jobs again and went to work in London as a script reader for one of the leading figures of Shaftesbury Avenue's commercial theatre, H. G. (Binkie) Beaumont of H. M. Tennent Ltd. Marshall was in his element at last. He was such pleasant company that everybody in the theatre seemed to know and like him, and this charming, funny, and uncompetitive person was invited everywhere. He spent many long weekends at Somerset Maugham's Villa Mauresque at Cap Ferrat on the French riviera and months with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in the USA. No doubt part of his attraction as a guest was that when conversation sagged his host would call upon him to entertain the company with a turn, and he was delighted to oblige.<br>
<br>In 1953 Marshall began to publish his humorous prose pieces in book form, beginning with <span class="italic">Nineteen to the Dozen</span> (1953); many more followed. He also published some gratifyingly successful compilations from the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> competitions and his own book reviews, <span class="italic">Salome Dear, not in the Fridge!</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Girls will be Girls</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Whimpering in the Rhododendrons</span> (1982), and <span class="italic">Giggling in the Shrubbery</span> (1985). In 1975 he started writing a regular column for the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and another for the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span>. He also became a regular broadcaster and chat-show guest and in 1979 was enlisted as a team captain in the BBC television game show <span class="italic">Call my Bluff</span>, which he graced for ten years.<br>
<br>In the world of broadcast humour in the 1980s it was Arthur Marshall who was the &#145;alternative comedian&#146;. This was the era dominated by young writers and comics who appealed to young viewers and readers with a stunning display of aggressive, sexual, and politically simplistic routines nurtured on the student union circuit. For those for whom this sort of comedy ceased to appeal much after the first excitement, Marshall's charming, intelligent, witty, and affectionate humour came as a breath of fresh air. He was perhaps the last flowering of the humour which Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele pioneered in the early eighteenth century and called &#145;polite comedy&#146;.<br>
<br>With his unconventional attitudes towards such things as religion and erudition, his distaste for foreigners, and his eyes sparkling and chins a-wobble at some absurdity he had noticed, a line of Rupert Brooke's should be bent to Arthur Marshall, this happiest of humorists, as &#145;an English unofficial sunbeam&#146;. His last years were spent in Devon where he lived at Pound Cottage, Christow, near Exeter, and during his final illness he was fortunate to have an old friend, Peter Kelland, a retired schoolmaster, to look after him and share his life. He died, unmarried, on 27 January 1989, and a memorial service was held in London on 19 July of that year.<br>
