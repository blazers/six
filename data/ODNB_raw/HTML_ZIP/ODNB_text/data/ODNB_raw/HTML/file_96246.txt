<span class="headword">Painter,  George Duncan</span>  (1914&#150;2005), <span class="occ">biographer and bibliographer</span>, was born on 5 June 1914 at 23 Galton Road, Oldbury, Worcestershire, near Birmingham, the son of George Charles Painter, schoolmaster and singer, and his wife, Minnie Rosendale, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor, artist. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was a Bell exhibitioner, attaining first-class honours in classics and the second chancellor's classical medal in 1936. In 1938, after a year working as a lecturer in Latin at Liverpool University, he joined the British Museum printed books department. During the Second World War he was a conscientious objector, serving in the Pioneer Corps. On 1 August 1942 he married (Isabel) Joan Britton, a 29-year-old state registered nurse, and daughter of Samuel Morley Britton, inspecting engineer. They had two daughters. After the war Painter returned to the British Museum. In 1954 he was appointed assistant keeper in charge of fifteenth-century books. He remained in that post until his retirement twenty years later.<br>
<br>In 1951 Painter published <span class="italic">The Road to Sinodun</span>, a volume of poetry written more than ten years earlier, which tells of the suffering and anxious self-scrutiny provoked by a failed relationship. The book was not a success and was Painter's only foray into that genre. His penetrating vision was focused thereafter on the lives of others, and on documents and textual sources, the assessment, analysis, and translation of which he performed with great skill, as testified by his short life of Andr&eacute; Gide, also published in 1951. He published translations of two of Gide's novels (<span class="italic">Marshlands</span> and <span class="italic">Prometheus Misbound</span>) in 1953, and, in 1956, Proust's <span class="italic">Letters to his Mother</span>. Nevertheless it was the two volumes of his <span class="italic">Marcel Proust: a Biography</span> (1959&#150;65) that made his name.<br>
<br>Painter's life of Proust is a hugely accomplished piece of scholarship, albeit flawed in the assumptions upon which it is founded (that Proust's characters in <span class="italic">&Agrave; la recherche du temps perdu</span> each had one or more &#145;originals&#146; among his real-life acquaintances, and that understanding the novel, a &#145;creative autobiography&#146;, was largely a matter of mapping one set of individuals onto the other) and in its overly simplistic Freudian interpretations of many events in Proust's life. Notwithstanding such criticisms&#151;and there are others, for instance that Painter did not carry out any interviews with Proust's living relatives or acquaintances&#151;his biography formed a landmark in an exceedingly crowded field, remained in print throughout his life, and contributed invaluably to an understanding of the socio-historical circumstances of the novel's production. The second volume of Painter's <span class="italic">Proust</span> received the Duff Cooper memorial prize in 1965, the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The first volume of his life of Chateaubriand (1977)&#151;in fact the only one to appear&#151;although less critically acclaimed than his <span class="italic">Proust</span> won the James Tait Black memorial prize.<br>
<br>As with his biographies, Painter's work in the field of bibliography and fifteenth-century printing was meticulous, although never without humour. This is evinced by his essay &#145;Caxton through the looking-glass&#146; (1963), his account, combining technical expertise, rigorous scholarship, and admirable analytical clarity, of how, using a mirror in analysing a fragment of printer's waste, he identified otherwise unknown editions of a text probably printed by Caxton. Painter's great depth of knowledge of his subject, something that exudes from the pages of his <span class="italic">Proust</span>, was no less evident in his bibliographical essays and reviews, the pick of which were collected in his <span class="italic">Studies in Fifteenth-Century Printing</span> (1984). His talents were seen at their most adventurous in his contributions to <span class="italic">The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation</span>, a contribution to the debate over the authenticity of the Vinland map, a supposed fifteenth-century copy of a much earlier Norse map of the North American coast, which he published in collaboration with R. A. Skelton and T. E. Marston in 1965. Painter introduced, edited, translated, and commented on the &#145;Tartar relation&#146;, the Latin text from which, he argued, much of the controversial map's annotations were drawn. He was repeatedly challenged by scholars sceptical of his claims for the map's authenticity and showed great tenacity in fighting his corner; the debate, nevertheless, remained open at the time of his death. His description of his remarkable undertakings as the efforts of a &#145;well-meaning layman&#146; was characteristic of his humility.<br>
<br>Painter published <span class="italic">The Chelsea Way, or, Marcel in England</span>, a translation of Andr&eacute; Maurois's Proustian pastiche, the year after <span class="italic">The Vinland Map</span>, an antidote, perhaps, to the rigours of his recent immersion in the Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century. This easy to-and-fro between the literary productions of the twentieth century and the medieval and early modern worlds is testimony to the remarkable amphibiousness of Painter's mind. He was appointed OBE in 1974, the year of his retirement. He published an exhaustive quincentennial biography of Caxton in 1976 and three years later received an honorary doctorate from the University of Edinburgh. From 1970 he lived with his wife in Hove, Sussex, where he enjoyed gardening and playing violin to his wife's piano accompaniment. He died at the Victoria Highgrove Nursing Home, 59 Dyke Road Avenue, Hove, on 8 December 2005. He was survived by his wife, Joan, and their two daughters.<br>
