<span class="headword">Travers,  James</span>  (1820&#150;1884), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Cork on 6 October 1820, the third son of Major-General Sir Robert Travers KCMG CB (<i>d</i>. 1834) of the 10th foot. After Addiscombe College he was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bengal infantry on 11 June 1838. He arrived at Fort William, Calcutta, on 12 January 1839, and served with the 57th native infantry at Barrackpore until posted to the 2nd native infantry at Ferozepore on 12 April 1839.<br>
<br>Travers served with his regiment in the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1841 and 1842, was repeatedly in action, and was mentioned in dispatches. He was promoted first lieutenant on 7 June 1841. He served with Nott's army and returned to Ferozepore on 23 December 1842. For his war service he was recommended for a brevet majority on attaining the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Travers returned to regimental duty in March 1843, and was appointed adjutant of the Bhopal contingent on 15 March. He was promoted captain on 7 January 1846, and brevet major the following day. In the same month he joined the army of the Sutlej. He commanded a Masiri battalion of Gurkhas in Sir Harry Smith's division at the battle of Sobraon on 10 February 1846, and was mentioned in dispatches. On 24 March 1846 he was appointed second in command of the Bhopal contingent. On 19 November 1849 he married, in India, Mary Isabella (1829/30&#150;1933), daughter of Donald Macintyre, founder of the Macintyre merchant firm in Calcutta. She was the sister of General Donald Macintyre VC; her elder sister married William Brydon, the only survivor of the retreat from Kabul in 1842.<br>
<br>On 13 February 1850 Travers became postmaster at Sehore, on 20 June 1854 he was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel, on 22 August 1855 was appointed officiating commandant, and on 15 February 1856 commandant, of the Bhopal contingent. In this year he commanded a force in the field against Sankar Sing, and received the thanks of government. On 6 December 1856 he was promoted colonel.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the Indian mutiny in 1857 Travers moved in the middle of June from Bhopal to Indore, where Colonel Henry Marion Durand was the resident, and assumed command of the forces there. On 1 July some of Holkar's troops mutinied, and thirty-nine people were massacred. Travers, uncertain of his own men, nevertheless no sooner heard the guns than he formed up the picket where they could most advantageously charge the guns of the mutineers, and at once ordered them to advance. Gallantly leading them, he drove away the gunners, wounded Saadat Khan, the inciter of the mutiny, and for a few moments had the guns in his possession. But he found only five men had followed him, and, as they were completely exposed to a galling infantry fire, he was obliged to retire. The charge, however, by creating a favourable diversion, not only enabled Durand to place the residency guns in position and to make some hurried arrangements for defence, but allowed many persons to escape to the residency. Travers opened fire from the residency guns, but his cavalry were leaving him, and his efforts to induce his infantry to charge were unavailing. The women and children were therefore placed on gun-carriages, and, covered by the cavalry&#151;which, though willing to follow Travers, would not fight for him&#151;the little band moved out of the residency, and arrived at Sehore on 4 July. For his bravery in charging the guns on 1 July, which Durand brought to notice in his dispatches, Travers was awarded the Victoria Cross on 1 March 1861.<br>
<br>Travers returned to duty with his old regiment, the 2nd native infantry, in 1858. On 8 September 1860 he was appointed commandant of the Central India horse, on 25 October 1861 brigadier-general commanding Saugor district, on 23 July 1865 he was promoted major-general, and the same year received a good-service pension. He was given the command of the Meerut division on 5 August 1869, was promoted lieutenant-general on 5 February 1873, and was made a CB, military division, on 24 May 1873. Travers was permitted on 3 July 1874 to reside out of India. He was promoted to be general on 1 October 1877, and was placed on the unemployed supernumerary list on 1 July 1881. He published in 1876 <span class="italic">The Evacuation of Indore</span>, to refute statements in J. W. Kaye's <span class="italic">History of the Sepoy War</span>. He died at Pallanza, Lago Maggiore, Italy, on 1 April 1884. His widow survived to the age of 103.<br>
