<span class="headword">Boyce <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Wells]</span>,  Joanna Mary</span>  (1831&#150;1861), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, daughter of George John Boyce (<i>d</i>. 1853) and his wife, Anne Price, and younger sister of the watercolourist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59467/', "George Price Boyce (1826&#150;1897)")</script>, was born in Gray's Inn Terrace, Bloomsbury, London, on 7 December 1831. Joanna's father was a wine merchant and pawnbroker in London. The Boyce family lived in Gray's Inn Terrace until 1840, when they moved to Park Place Villas in Maida Hill. As a child Joanna Boyce showed an interest in art, in which she was encouraged by her father, who took her to exhibitions and lectures (and in 1851 to the funeral of J. M. W. Turner). At the age of seventeen she was allowed to enrol at Cary's school of art. In April 1852 she visited Paris with her father so that she might study contemporary French painting. Later in the same year father and daughter, with George Price Boyce, stayed at Betws-y-coed in Wales. George Boyce's death in September 1853 was a great loss to Joanna; by contrast, Anne Boyce was not supportive of her daughter's ambitions as an artist, and there were occasions when Joanna was close to giving up painting.<br>
<br>Joanna Boyce received advice on her painting from <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36830/', "Henry Tanworth Wells (1828&#150;1903)")</script>, who had been a friend of George's since 1849. However, Wells, who was already established as a portraitist and miniaturist, seems to have little understood the progressive and challenging character of Joanna's painting, and his point of view contrasts significantly with that of her brother, with whom Joanna seems to have had a truer sympathy in artistic matters. In 1853 Joanna Boyce transferred to Leigh's school of art and in 1854 she attended classes at the Government School of Design. In the spring of 1854 Joanna Boyce was contemplating a period of training in either D&uuml;sseldorf or Munich. This did not materialize, but in the autumn of the year she did travel in Belgium and the Netherlands. During the early 1850s she was introduced to members of the London-based Pre-Raphaelite circle by her brother.<br>
<br>In September 1855 Joanna Boyce returned to Paris, on this occasion in company with her mother and brother Bob. She hoped to be able to attend painting classes under Rosa Bonheur, but for some reason&#151;perhaps to do with her mother's or Wells's influence&#151;she went instead to the studio of Thomas Couture, where she attended life classes in the atelier reserved for female students. In her two-part article &#145;Remarks on some of the French pictures at the Paris Exhibition, 1855&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> (1 and 29 December 1855), Joanna Boyce deplored the influence of Ingres on contemporary French painting and praised works by Constant Troyon and Couture. She was commissioned by the same periodical to write a three-part review of the 1856 Royal Academy exhibition  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 10, 17, and 24 May 1856). Here she praised Millais's <span class="italic">Autumn Leaves</span> and Holman Hunt's <span class="italic">Scapegoat</span>, and also took her opportunity to lambaste the works of the academicians: &#145;In truth, there are but three or four out of the whole number to whose works we annually look forward with anything like longing or curiosity&#146;  (ibid., 24 May 1856, 79).<br>
<br>Joanna Boyce first exhibited in public at the National Institution in 1854 and in 1855 her painting <span class="italic">Elgiva</span> (priv. coll.) was shown at the Royal Academy. In a late edition of <span class="italic">Academy Notes</span> Ruskin described the work as &#145;so subtle, and so tenderly wrought&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Works of John Ruskin</span>, ed. E. T. Cook and A. Wedderburn, 1903&#150;12, 14.30&#150;31), and Ford Madox Brown called it simply &#145;the best Head in the rooms&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Ford Madox Brown</span>, ed. V. Surtees, 1981, 138). She exhibited a further eight works at the academy, including <span class="italic">The Departure: an Episode of the Child's Crusade</span> (priv. coll.) in 1860 and <span class="italic">The Veneziana</span> (priv. coll.) and <span class="italic">Peep-Bo!</span> (des.) in 1861. On at least two occasions works of hers were rejected by the academy selection committees: in 1856 <span class="italic">Rowena Offering the Wassail Cup to Vortigern</span> and in 1859 <span class="italic">&#145;No Joy the Blowing Season Brings&#146;</span> were refused. The latter was subsequently much admired in Ernest Gambart's 1859 winter exhibition at the French Gallery.<br>
<br>For a while Joanna Boyce resisted Henry Wells's proposals of marriage. In a postscript to a letter to him of June 1855 she announced that the &#145;intense love of independence, which has often been a bane to me&#146;  (Boyce family MSS) was being overcome, but on 10 February 1857 she still feared the loss of liberty that might go with marriage, for &#145;I have talents or a talent and with it the constant impulse to enjoy it,&#151;not for notoriety or fame, but for the love of it and the longing to work&#146;  (ibid.). Later in 1857 they travelled together in Italy and, according to a plan which had been previously divulged to Joanna's siblings, were married on 7 December in Rome, their wedding being solemnized at the British consulate. After their return to England in March 1858 they set up house in 1859 in Upper Phillimore Gardens, and later had built a country house at Holmbury Hill in Surrey. They had three children&#151;Sidney and Alice were the inspiration for various of their mother's last paintings. It was following the birth of her third child, Joanna Margaret, and as a result of ensuing gastroenteric fever that Joanna died, on 15 July 1861, at her home, 9 Upper Phillimore Gardens. She was buried in the Boyce family tomb at Kensal Green cemetery, her body subsequently being removed to rest with that of her husband after his death in 1903.<br>
<br>Friends and fellow painters were invited to see the works that remained in Joanna Wells's studio. D. G. Rossetti, Burne-Jones, F. M. Brown, and Watts were among those who expressed their admiration for her art. <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>'s obituarist concluded that &#145;no English-woman has ever set forth such mastery of style and such subtle qualities of painting as are impressed upon her works&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 20 July 1861, 783), and drew a parallel between her early death and that of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, which had occurred a month or so before. Joanna Wells was represented in the Royal Academy summer exhibition in the year after her death, with a painting entitled <span class="italic">A Bird of God</span> (priv. coll.). Five of her paintings were also included in the International Exhibition of 1862. She was represented in the 1901 Royal Academy exhibition &#145;Works by deceased British artists&#146;, and in 1935 an exhibition of thirty-one of her paintings was held at the Tate Gallery.<br>
