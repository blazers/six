<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ayscue, Sir  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1615&#150;1672), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the eldest son of William Ayscue (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1632), originally of Lincoln, gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I. The identity of his mother is uncertain. Ayscue was also a godson of George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, who bequeathed to him &pound;10 and &#145;one of the summer nags I have running amongst my horses&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/164, fol. 211). He leased Hamm Court, Weybridge, in 1634, and was knighted on 9 August 1641, perhaps one of the last to be elevated under the distraint of knighthood policy. He married, at some time between 1645 and 1651, Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9974/', "Martin Fotherby")</script>, bishop of Salisbury, and widow of John Boys (<i>d</i>. 1641).<br>
<br>There is no record of Ayscue serving in the navy before 1646 when he commanded the <i>Expedition</i> at the siege of Pendennis Castle, and he subsequently served as governor of the Isles of Scilly until January 1647. He was captain of the <i>Antelope</i> in 1647 and of the <i>Lion</i> in 1648. He was one of the leading opponents of the naval revolt in the latter year, when a substantial part of the fleet mutinied against Vice-Admiral Rainborough and joined the royalists, and served as rear-admiral of the force which went to Helvoetsluys to try to force the defectors to surrender. He was appointed admiral of the Irish seas in 1649, perhaps because of the influence of his kinsman by marriage, the leading politician Sir Henry Vane. He was thanked by parliament on 23 July 1649 for his part in keeping open the sea route to Dublin, then under siege by the marquess of Ormond. In 1650 he was appointed governor of Barbados and commander of the squadron intended to recapture that island, but before he could set out he was diverted to serve as Blake's second-in-command in the attack on the royalist garrison in Scilly (April to May 1651). Ayscue finally sailed for Barbados on 5 August 1651. Despite stiff resistance from the royalist governor, Lord Willoughby of Parham, which ruled out a direct assault, Ayscue eventually obtained the island's surrender on 11 January 1652.<br>
<br>Ayscue's fleet returned to Plymouth on 25 May 1652 to find the First Anglo-Dutch War had begun. On 12 June he engaged an outward-bound Dutch fleet off the Lizard, but this got away with only five losses. Early in July, acting on intelligence that a Dutch convoy of about forty ships was attempting to sail home up the channel, Ayscue intercepted them near Calais with nine ships, including his flagship the <i>Rainbow</i>, and drove most of them ashore. However, on 8 July he learned that Tromp's Dutch fleet was approaching the Downs, and resolved to fight despite having only twenty ships against Tromp's sixty. Shore batteries were prepared at Deal and fireships fitted out at Dover to support Ayscue's precarious position. The Dutch moved towards him on 11 July but were hampered by light winds; when the wind freshened from the south-west, the Dutch moved away to pursue Blake's main fleet, which had gone north. As commander of the channel squadron with his flag now in the <i>George</i>, Ayscue escorted the homecoming East India ships into Plymouth at the end of July, where he learned that another Dutch fleet under De Ruyter was approaching. Ayscue caught up with him between Plymouth and Guernsey on 16 August. Each side overestimated the strength of the other, and the fighting was confused; Ayscue seems to have attacked the Dutch centre but was not supported by all the armed merchantmen in his fleet, and his remaining ships were badly damaged in close-quarter fighting. Despite losing no ships outright, the English withdrew to Plymouth hotly pursued by De Ruyter, who intended to attack them in their anchorage, but a change of wind forced him to withdraw. Nevertheless, he got his convoy through and kept the seas.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Ayscue retired from his command, receiving a pension of &pound;800 p.a. from parliament (&pound;300 of it in the form of lands in Ireland). Although there had been criticism of his conduct of the action, it was also true that he had been unwell in the summer, possibly of a fever contracted in the West Indies, and he was deeply concerned about his private affairs, especially the damage to his Hamm Court estate caused by projectors attempting to make the River Wey navigable. It is also possible that he was ideologically opposed to the war; the republican preacher Hugh Peters wrote to him at this time, decrying a war between two such kindred nations. Despite regular rumours that he would be re-employed, Ayscue lived in retirement at Hamm Court, entertaining the Swedish ambassador there in August 1656; the house was said to be:<blockquote>environed with ponds, moats and water, like a ship at sea: a fancy the fitter for the master's humour, who is himself so great a seaman. There, he said, he had cast anchor and intended to spend the rest of his life in a private retirement. (<span class="italic">Diary of Bulstrode Whitelocke</span>, 13 Aug 1656)</blockquote>The Swedish connection led to Ayscue offering his services to Carl X in 1658, and on 26 August he was granted a commission as admiral, with a salary of 4000 riksdalers a year. Flying his flag in the <i>Victoria</i>, he sailed from Landstrom on 30 June 1659 to meet Edward Montagu's English fleet, which had been sent to support the Swedes, and the two admirals dined together on 8 July. It seems likely that by this time Ayscue had become a covert royalist&#151;he was married to a member of one of the leading royalist families in Kent&#151;but he seems to have taken no active part in the royalist attempts to win over Montagu and his fleet. Ayscue subsequently returned to Landstrom, staying there until 6 November, when he sailed to intercept a Dutch convoy; however, the target was too well protected. He returned to England in the summer of 1660, shortly before the expiry of his Swedish commission on 8 September. Over the next few years he renewed his contacts in the English navy, attending Trinity House dinners and visiting Chatham with Sir William Penn. He became captain of the <i>Henry</i> in October 1664, serving as vice-admiral to Montagu, now earl of Sandwich, throughout 1665, including at the battle of Lowestoft. Sandwich was implicated in the plundering of Dutch East Indiamen in September 1665, but Ayscue refused to have anything to do with it and openly attacked his conduct. Originally appointed admiral of the blue for the 1666 campaign, he became admiral of the white, flying his flag in the 92-gun <i>Prince</i>, when Prince Rupert's squadron was detached from the main fleet at the end of May. On the third day of the Four Days' Battle (3 June 1666) the <i>Prince</i> ran aground on the Galloper Sand. Cut off from any support from her own side and with Dutch fireships approaching, members of her crew panicked and struck her flag. Ayscue was paraded through The Hague&#151;although stories of his being painted and having a tail pinned on him were propaganda&#151;and interrogated by the Dutch (who were unable to comprehend his Lincolnshire accent) before being imprisoned in Loevestein Castle. He remained a prisoner until October 1667, well after the peace had been signed, and was received graciously by Charles II on 12 November, the blame for the <i>Prince's</i> loss being assigned to the crew rather than their commander. Ayscue commanded the <i>Triumph</i> briefly in May and June 1668, and in 1669 visited his Irish estates, which had been the source of protracted legal disputes with the bishop of Ossory in the preceding years. When the Third Anglo-Dutch War began, it was intended that Ayscue would be vice-admiral of the red, flying his flag in the <i>Saint Andrew</i> (to which he was appointed in January 1672). However, he died at his house in Westminster on 5 April 1672, and was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster, eight days later. He left his estate to his stepdaughter, Margaret Boys, his wife, Mary, and at least one son, George, having predeceased him.<br>
<br>Opinions of Ayscue varied. Clarendon called him &#145;a gentleman, but had kept ill company too long, which had blunted his understanding, if it had ever been sharp: he was of few words, yet spake to the purpose and to be easily understood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 2.355). Pepys believed he did not have &#145;much of a seaman in him &hellip; by his discourse I find that he hath not minded anything in [his ship] at all&#146;  (Pepys, 5.317), but then Ayscue had just criticized the lack of organization of the Navy Board which Pepys served. On the other hand, Sir William Coventry found him &#145;a very honest, gallant man &hellip; he does not serve mercenarily, for he lives handsomely and honourably in the fleet, beyond his pay&#146;  (Coventry to Arlington, 22 April 1665, <span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1664&#150;5</i>, 324).<br>
