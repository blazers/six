<span class="headword">Dobson,  Frank Owen</span>  (1886&#150;1963), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, Marylebone Road, London, on 18 November 1886, the son of Frank Dobson (1857&#150;1900), artist, and his wife, Alice Mary Owen. His parents lived at 7 Acton Street, Clerkenwell, London. His father specialized in bird and flower studies, most of which were sold as greetings cards. He attended school first in Forest Gate and then in Harrow Green. At the age of eleven he won an art scholarship to Leyton Technical School, which he attended part-time. His father died when he was fourteen and he went to live with an aunt in Hastings, Sussex, and attended evening classes at Hastings School of Art. After a few months he left to take up a position with the sculptor William Reynolds-Stephens as a studio assistant, and stayed for a year and a half. He then travelled to Devon and afterwards to Cornwall, where he shared a studio with Cedric L. Morris and managed to make a living by selling his paintings. In 1906 he was granted a scholarship to the Hospitalfield Art Institute in Arbroath, Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1910 Dobson moved to London, where he attended the City and Guilds Art School, Kennington. He then returned to Cornwall, settled in Newlyn, and made the acquaintance of Augustus John through whom he was offered a one-man exhibition of paintings and drawings at the Chenil Galleries in London in 1914. Early in 1915 he enlisted in the Artists' Rifles and in October 1916 was posted to France, where he was a lieutenant in the 5th Border regiment. In January 1917 he was diagnosed as suffering from a duodenal ulcer and sent back to England. On 27 April 1918, while at a military convalescent centre in London, he married, at Christ Church, Marylebone, Cordelia Clara Tregurtha (<i>b</i>. 1888/9), daughter of Thomas Tregurtha, a fitter, whom he had met in Newlyn before the war. He was invalided out of the army in November 1918. In August of that year he was commissioned by the Ministry of Information to paint the balloon apron at Canvey Island, Essex (Imperial War Museum, London), for which purpose he took a studio in Trafalgar Studios, Manresa Road, Chelsea, London, where he lived until 1939.<br>
<br>In March 1920, at the invitation of Wyndham Lewis, Dobson took part in the Group X exhibition at Ambrose Heal's Mansard Gallery, London. He showed <span class="italic">Pigeon Boy</span> (Portland stone, 1920, Courtauld Inst.), <span class="italic">Concertina Man</span> (Portland stone, 1920), and two studies of the artist Ben Nicholson&#151;a plaster cast (now lost) and a drawing (priv. coll.). In November 1921 he exhibited sculpture and drawings at the Leicester Galleries, London, including <span class="italic">The Man Child</span> (Portland stone, 1921, Tate collection), <span class="italic">Two Heads</span> (Red Mansfield sandstone, 1921, Courtauld Inst.), and <span class="italic">The Rt. Hon H. H. Asquith, M.P.</span> (bronze, 1921, Tate collection).<br>
<br>In 1922 Dobson spent three months working on a portrait of the writer Osbert Sitwell (polished bronze, 1922, Tate collection). Sitwell invited him to design the curtain for <span class="italic">Fa&ccedil;ade</span>, a theatrical entertainment written by his sister, the poet Edith Sitwell, with music by William Walton, which had its first performance in his house in Carlyle Square, Chelsea. During the 1920s Dobson made portraits of the ballerina Lydia Lopokova (bronze, 1924, University of Hull Art Gallery), the American actress Tallulah Bankhead (bronze, 1924&#150;5), the composer and conductor Eugene Goossens (bronze, 1924 or 1925), the American writer Robert Menzies McAlmon (bronze, 1923, priv. coll.), and Sidney Bernstein, founder of the Granada group (bronze, 1929, priv. coll.).<br>
<br>In 1923 Dobson first exhibited <span class="italic">Seated Torso</span> (Ham Hill stone, 1923, Aberdeen Art Gallery) and <span class="italic">Robert McAlmon</span> with the avant-garde London Group, of which he was president from 1924 to 1927. He exhibited at the 14th Venice Biennale in 1924, showing <span class="italic">Concertina Man</span> and <span class="italic">Male Head</span>, and again in 1926 at the 15th Biennale, when he showed <span class="italic">Susanna</span> (bronze, 1922&#150;4, Tate collection). In 1925 he showed in the Tri-National Exhibition in Paris, London, and New York, and in 1926 he was included in the European artists' exhibition that toured Canada and the United States. During the winter of 1925 he travelled with the writer Leo H. Myers to Ceylon. On returning to England he started one of his most important works, a large stone carving of a wading female figure, <span class="italic">Cornucopia</span> (Ham Hill stone, 1925&#150;7, University of Hull Art Gallery). In 1925 the Contemporary Art Society purchased his <span class="italic">Head of a Girl (Study for &#145;Cornucopia I&#146;)</span> (bronze, 1925) and presented it to the Tate Gallery.<br>
<br>Dobson's view of sculpture as essentially a composition of abstract forms led to his creating simplified, harmonious figures and groups which excluded extraneous detail and narrative content and respected the intrinsic qualities of the materials of which they were made. Roger Fry and Clive Bell, the leading critics of the day, welcomed the appearance of a British sculptor whose work they considered exemplified their fundamental artistic philosophy. Fry wrote that:<blockquote>Perhaps Mr. Dobson did not know at the start what he was in for when he set out as a sculptor, and a sculptor who would confine himself to sculptural plasticity. Whether he knew it or not, his having pulled through to some kind of recognition is one of the happiest omens for English art of today. For whether we like his work or not, we must admit that it is true sculpture and pure sculpture, and that this is almost the first time that such a thing has even been attempted in England. (Fry, 172)</blockquote>By 1926 Dobson had separated from his wife and embarked on a new relationship with (Caroline) Mary Bussell (1904&#150;1989), daughter of the art dealer William Charles Bussell. On 29 March 1928 their daughter was born, and on 6 August 1931, following his divorce, Dobson married Mary in Chelsea, London.<br>
<br>In March 1927 Dobson's first major exhibition in London opened at the Leicester Galleries. He showed twenty-three sculptures, including <span class="italic">Cornucopia</span>, <span class="italic">Susanna</span>, and <span class="italic">Marble Woman</span> (also known as <span class="italic">Reclining Nude</span>; white marble, 1924&#150;5, Courtauld Inst.), together with portraits of Lydia Lopokova, Tallulah Bankhead, Eugene Goossens, and Leo Myers (bronze, 1927, priv. coll.). He also showed with the London Artists' Association (of which he was a founder member) in November of that year. In 1930 he designed a series of gilded faience panels, <span class="italic">The Chain of Commerce</span>, for the Hay's Wharf Company's new headquarters on the Thames at London Bridge. In the same year his larger-than-life bronze figure <span class="italic">Truth</span> was purchased by public subscription and erected outside the Tate Gallery. During the 1930s he continued to receive commissions for portraits; two of the most notable are the bronze busts of the actress Margaret Rawlings (Lady Barlow) (1936, versions in Manchester City Galleries, Leeds City Art Gallery, and the Tate collection) and the patron and collector Sir Edward Marsh (1938, Museum and Art Gallery, Doncaster). He also produced designs for textiles (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). In 1937 he was commissioned to design a silver-gilt cup, <span class="italic">Calix majestatis</span> (Royal Collection), in honour of the coronation of George VI and Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>Dobson fractured his left arm in 1933, an injury which severely restricted his ability to carve. His last large stone carving was <span class="italic">Pax</span> (1934, priv. coll.) which was shown in the London Group exhibition in April and May 1935, in &#145;Two hundred years of British art&#146;, at The Hague in 1936, and at the New York World Fair in 1939. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Dobson and his family moved to Bristol and in March 1940 the Bristol Art Gallery held the largest retrospective exhibition accorded to him in his lifetime. Following a series of air raids the Dobsons moved to Kingsley in Hampshire. During the war he received official commissions for drawings and for two portrait busts, <span class="italic">Admiral Sir William Milbourne James KCB</span> (bronze, 1941, NMM) and <span class="italic">Chief Petty Officer Harris John Whitehorne DSM</span> (also bronze, 1941, IWM).<br>
<br>Having first shown work in the Royal Academy's annual summer exhibition in 1933, Dobson was elected an associate in 1942 and Royal Academician in 1951. At the suggestion of Henry Moore he was appointed head of sculpture at the Royal College of Art, London, in 1946, and remained until his retirement in 1953. He was appointed CBE in 1947. During the 1951 Festival of Britain, Dobson's <span class="italic">London Pride</span> was displayed on the south bank of the Thames. Originally shown in plaster, it was cast posthumously in bronze and placed in front of the Royal National Theatre in 1987.<br>
<br>Among Dobson's last commissions were a portrait of Sir Thomas Lipton (bronze, 1954), an engraved glass goblet entitled <span class="italic">The Wave</span> (1954, Steuben glass collection, Corning, New York), the statuette for the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> drama awards (1955), and a zodiac clock (1959) for the fa&ccedil;ade of Sir Albert Richardson's Bracken House in Cannon Street, London. His declining health led to his being admitted to the Princess Beatrice Hospital in Kensington, London, where he died on 22 July 1963. His wife and daughter survived him. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the River Thames.<br>
<br>Dobson's early experiments with angular forms influenced by cubism soon gave way to a softer, more sensual style. His subject was the female body, and his treatment of it was undoubtedly influenced by his admiration for the French sculptor Aristide Maillol. At their best his figures have a monumental dignity and repose. Although during the 1920s he was seen as one of the adventurous spirits of the British modern movement, his reputation began to be eclipsed during the 1930s and 1940s by the emerging talents of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. He is seen as a transitional figure in the development of British sculpture, linking the previous school of traditional academic or Romantic sculptors with the generation which followed him. While he may be said to share his position as a pioneer with two other sculptors, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Jacob Epstein, Dobson was the only one of these three to have been born in England.<br>
