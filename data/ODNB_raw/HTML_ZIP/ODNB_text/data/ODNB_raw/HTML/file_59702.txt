<span class="headword">Hunter,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> after 1803), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was described as from Ulster and taught by Justin Pope Stevens  (Pasquin, 13). The establishment portrait painter in Dublin for the second half of the eighteenth century, he was much admired by his contemporaries and slightly later critics, including William Carey, who saw him as &#145;a walking chronicle of everything relative to the Irish artists and arts&#146;  (Carey, 226), and W. B. Sarsfield Taylor, who said he took &#145;excellent likenesses&#146; and that his practice was extensive  (Taylor, 284). He was sufficiently well known to be commissioned to paint a whole-length of Sir Charles Burton, lord mayor of Dublin, in 1753 (now known from a mezzotint by James McArdell). The group of six portraits of the King family (priv. coll.), long attributed to Hunter, were painted about 1748 and are lively and strong in colour. His three-quarter-length (his favourite size) of the illustrious philanthropist and writer Samuel Madden (Trinity College, Dublin) is a portrait worthy of the sitter and was engraved with some alterations by Richard Purcell in 1756. Hunter was much influenced by English painters such as Thomas Hudson, Reynolds, and Arthur Devis, whose work he knew through engravings and frequently used as a source for his own compositions. It is uncertain whether he ever visited England. He exhibited between 1765 and 1777 at the Society of Artists in Ireland many portraits, a few subject pictures (all now lost), and many small whole-lengths, often of sitters in fancy dress such as Thomas Conolly of Castletown (1771) in Van Dyck costume. In some cases the small whole-lengths may have been made as copies for the sitter's family, as there are several which are duplicates of larger portraits, for example that of Henry de Burgh, first marquess of Clanricarde (1783); the larger version is at Harewood House, Yorkshire, and the smaller was sold at Sothebys (9 March 1988), when it was incorrectly identified as the marquess of Buckingham (<i>c</i>.1783) whose whole-length portrait by Hunter (the deanery, St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin) also has a small version (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin).<br>
<br>From his early, somewhat baroque, manner Hunter moved to a simpler style in which his sitters are often set in a well-observed and painted landscape, as, for example, in the whole-length, probably of Peter La Touche, where the figure is resting while out shooting with his dog (1775, National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). His masterpiece is his three-quarter-length portrait of Lord Newbottle, later fifth marquess of Lothian, painted in uniform (1762, priv. coll.). His half-lengths include several versions of Lord Harcourt, lord lieutenant from 1772 to 1777, engraved by Edward Fisher in 1775 (versions Ulster Museum, Belfast; National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin; and elsewhere), and Henry Haughton, Hunter's last known dated work (1790, ex Christies, 1 March 1985, lot 113). A few double portraits can be attributed to him. Although it is not known how much he charged for a portrait, he was paid &pound;7 7<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. in 1788 for repairing a portrait of Charles II for Dublin corporation.<br>
<br>Although Ireland was visited by the portraitists Robert Home (1779&#150;89) and Gilbert Stuart (1789&#150;93) who had great success with commissions, it was probably age and not competition (as has been suggested) which reduced Hunter's output in the late 1780s. No work by him is known after 1790. According to Strickland, Hunter held an exhibition of his work in 1792, though no evidence for this has been traced. If such an exhibition did take place it would have been the first one-man show to have been held in Dublin. Hunter exhibited pictures for the last time at the Society of Artists in 1800, and continued to leave his name in the Dublin directory until 1803, soon after which date he must have died. He had lived in Dublin all his working life.<br>
<br>Hunter married about 1750 and his only child, Mary Anne Hunter [<a name="cosubject_59702"></a><span class="headword">Mary Anne Trotter</span>  (<em>b. </em>1752, <em>d.</em> before 1792)], <span class="occ">painter</span>, exhibited at the Society of Artists in Ireland between 1765, when she was thirteen, and 1777. She married the portrait painter John Trotter (<i>d</i>. 1792) in 1774, after which time she exhibited under the name Mary Anne Trotter. She predeceased her husband, whose second wife, Elizabeth, survived him. Mary Anne was probably the mother of <a name="cosubject_59831"></a><span class="headword">Eliza H. Trotter</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1800&#150;1815), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, who was the daughter of John Trotter. Eliza Trotter exhibited in Dublin between 1800 and 1809, trained at the Royal Academy Schools in London from 1809 to 1812, and exhibited between 1811 and 1815 at the Royal Academy and British Institution from addresses in Westminster and Hammersmith. Her portrait of Lady Caroline Lamb (exh. 1811) is in the National Portrait Gallery, London.<br>
