<span class="headword">Holland,  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>1583, <em>d.</em> in or after 1649), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13535/', "Philemon Holland (1552&#150;1637)")</script> and his wife, Anne (1555&#150;1627), daughter of William Bott, alias Peyton, was born at Coventry on 29 September 1583. His brothers were the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13514/', "Abraham Holland (d. 1626)")</script> and the print publisher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64982/', "Compton Holland (d. 1622)")</script>. He went to London as a young man and usually designated himself &#145;Londonopolitanus&#146;. Although he proved in later life a good classical scholar, and was clearly well educated, Holland was apprenticed to John Norton from 25 March 1599 and made free of the Stationers' Company on 5 December 1608. The first book published by him was Thomas Draxe's <span class="italic">Sicke Man's Catechisme</span> (1609), which was licensed to Holland and John Wright jointly on 4 February 1608&#150;9. In 1610 he published, from a previously unprinted manuscript, Sir John Cheke's <span class="italic">A Royal Elegie</span>, on Edward VI; the book is now of great rarity. In 1613 he accompanied John, first Lord Harington, whose family had been on friendly terms with his father, to the Palatinate, when Harington accompanied Princess Elizabeth to the home of her husband, the elector palatine. In 1614 Holland published, in conjunction with Matthew Law, his compilation <span class="italic">Monumenta sepulchraria sancti Pauli: the monuments &hellip; of kings, nobles, bishops, and others buried in the cathedrall church of St. Paul, London, untill this present yeare &hellip; 1614, and a catalogue of all the bishops of London &hellip; untill this present</span>. It was reissued as <span class="italic">Ecclesia sancti Pauli illustrata</span> in 1633 with a dedication by Holland, addressed to Laud, then bishop of London, and to the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral.<br>
<br>Holland's reputation as a bookseller rested chiefly on two elaborately illustrated antiquarian works, with letterpress from his own pen. The earlier venture was <span class="italic">Baziliologia: a booke of kings, beeing the true and lively effigies of all our English kings from the conquest untill this present, with their severall coats of armes, impreses, and devises, and a briefe chronologie of their lives and deaths, elegantly graven in copper, printed for H. Holland, and are to be sold by Comp. Holland over against the Xchange, 1618</span>. The engravers employed included R. Elstracke, Simon Pass, and Francis Delaram, the last being responsible for the fine portraits of queens Mary and Elizabeth and princes Henry and Charles. Perfect copies include thirty-one portraits besides the title-page engraved with portraits of James I and Queen Anne.<br>
<br>Holland's second and more famous illustrated publication, <span class="italic">Heroologia Anglica, hoc est, clarissimorum et doctissimorum aliquot Anglorum qui floruerunt ab anno Christi <span class="smallcap">M.D.</span> usque ad presentem annum <span class="smallcap">M.D.C.XX</span>, vivae effigies, vitae, et elogia, duobus tomis, authore H. H., Anglo-Britanno, impensis Crispini Passaei calcographus et Jansoni bibliopolae Arnhemiensis</span> (1620), appeared in two folio volumes, the first dedicated to James I and the second to the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. There are sixty-five portraits, the first of Henry VIII, the last of Thomas Holland (<i>d</i>. 1612), regius professor of divinity at Oxford, and two engravings of monuments (of Prince Henry and Queen Elizabeth respectively). A presentation copy from Holland to Sir Thomas Holland is in the Grenville collection at the British Museum; another copy, with an inscription addressed by Holland to Robert Sidney, earl of Leicester, is described by Lowndes.<br>
<br>Holland seems to have carried on his publishing business until 1630. His less elaborate publications included <span class="italic">Newes from Frankfort</span> (1612) and <span class="italic">Newes from Gulick and Cleve</span> (1615) (jointly with G. Gibbs). In 1626 he printed at his own expense and published at Cambridge his brother Abraham's posthumous works as <span class="italic">Hollandi posthuma</span>. To <span class="italic">Salomon's Pest House</span>, by I. D., which he published with T. Harper in 1630, he added &#145;Mr. Hollands Admonition&#146;, a poem by his brother Abraham. Holland helped his father with his later publications. He wrote the dedication to Charles I of his father's <span class="italic">Cyropaedia</span> of Xenophon (1632), and edited after Dr Holland's death his Latin version of Bauderon's <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia</span> (1639), and his <span class="italic">Regimen sanitatis Salerni</span> (1649).<br>
<br>Holland's last days were spent in great poverty. A broadsheet issued on 26 June 1647, addressed &#145;to men, fathers, and brethren&#146;, appealed for charitable aid, stating that Holland had been &#145;a grandjury-man, and a subsidy-man, and one of the trained band charged with a corslet&#146;  (BL, 669, fol. 11, no. 34), and had acted as a commissioner under the great seal against bankrupts. His credit had been good, and he had rented a house in the parish of St Mary-le-Bow. During the plague in London in 1625 he and his wife, Susannah, had worked hard among the poor. She had since died (10 December 1635) at the Black Raven in Cheapside. As &#145;a zealous hater and abhorrer of all superstition and Popery and prelaticall innovations in church government&#146; he had incurred the wrath of Laud, and had been imprisoned by order of both the high commission court and the Star Chamber. He declared himself adverse to &#145;all late sprung-up sectaries&#146;. In 1643 he served in the life guards of Basil Feilding, earl of Denbigh, the parliamentary general, and was &#145;eldest man&#146; of the troop, being sixty years old. Subsequently his eyesight and hearing had much decayed, he was crazy in his limbs, impotent in body, and so &#145;indigent in estate&#146; owing to lawsuits that he had had to plead in a chancery suit <i>in forma pauperis</i>. The facts are attested by four persons, including William Gouge the puritan divine; but the facts that Holland dedicated his book about St Paul's Cathedral to Laud in 1633, and that his imprisonment has not been corroborated, throw some doubt on the details. The title-page of his father's posthumously published <span class="italic">Regimen</span> shows that Holland was still alive in 1649. The circumstances of his death are unknown.<br>
