<span class="headword">Clinton,  Geoffrey  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1133), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, came of a family originating at Semilly in the Cotentin, which after 1066 seems to have acquired certain English possessions, notably Glympton (<i>Clintona</i>) in Oxfordshire. Clinton may have been among those taken into the service of the future king, Henry I, while he ruled the Cotentin in the 1090s, but the first trace of him in royal service is in an attestation of 1110 to an act of King Henry's at Woodstock. The fall of Herbert the chamberlain in 1118 brought Clinton into a more prominent position in the administration of the king's treasure. He took Herbert's place, and probably in 1121 obtained in addition the shrievalty of Warwick. His acquisition of the office of sheriff was for a purpose. In 1124, Roger, earl of Warwick, was compromised in the rebellious schemes of his cousin, Waleran, count of Meulan, and at the same time Clinton acquired seventeen fees from the earl. The transfer of lands from earl to sheriff must have been a forced enfeoffment designed to lessen the king's ill will against Earl Roger, by an act of patronage towards Clinton, the king's servant. The foundation chronicle of Biddlesden Abbey notes just such another enfeoffment in his favour, on this occasion by a Bedfordshire baron who needed his support when trying to escape the consequences of a forest offence. The king enhanced his local power by grants of royal demesne at Kenilworth near Warwick. He then underlined his local dominance by the building of a castle and priory there in 1124. It was doubtless at this time of royal favour that Clinton acquired his collection of fees from several magnates: the earl of Gloucester, and the Stafford and Ferrers families, among others. In 1129 he further consolidated his local position when his nephew Roger obtained the see of Coventry (on Clinton's payment of 3000 marks, as it was alleged).<br>
<br>In the meantime Clinton had brought into Warwickshire a number of Normans from the Cotentin as his tenants. The pipe roll compiled at Michaelmas 1130 gives a picture of him at the height of his power. His exemptions from danegeld reveal a great landed estate of at least 578 hides concentrated in the south and west midlands. It also illustrates why he has been taken by modern writers as the archetype of Henry I's &#145;new man&#146;. He held numerous wardships, of individuals and the abbey of Evesham; he had taken up debts and farms of royal manors. During the years before 1130 he had been active as a justice in seventeen counties. He was everywhere involved in business, manipulation, and making money. No wonder that he had enemies. These engineered his temporary downfall at Easter 1130, when he was arrested at Woodstock for alleged treason. Those who charged him were not named, but are suggested to have been members of Roger of Warwick's family, which returned to royal favour in the course of 1129. Clinton escaped the charges by heavy bribes, and continued to appear in the royal entourage until 1133. He died before 1135; a late writ of Henry I survives referring to his death.<br>
<br>By 1124 Clinton was married and had sons. He was succeeded by the younger Geoffrey of Clinton, who was a minor, as appears from an account of a deathbed grant in the Kenilworth cartulary. A measure of continuing royal favour after 1130 is that the younger Geoffrey was given to his uncle, William, in wardship; he ran into trouble at some time in 1137 or 1138, when the earl of Warwick attempted to reclaim the lands extorted from him by Geoffrey's father. The problem was eventually solved by a marriage treaty, by which Geoffrey married Agnes, the earl's young daughter, and received his lands back at preferential terms, with a concession of the hereditary possession of the shrievalty of Warwick. He died about 1175. Clinton also had another son, Robert (mentioned in a charter of the younger Geoffrey), and at least one daughter, Lescelina, for whom he bought the manor of Wolfhamcote, Warwickshire, as an endowment.<br>
