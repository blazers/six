<span class="headword">Shaw <span class="st"> [Shaa]</span>, Sir  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1488), <span class="occ">goldsmith and mayor of London</span>, was the son of John Shaa of Dukinfield in Cheshire. He was apprenticed in 1450 to a London goldsmith, probably Robert Butler, and completed his apprenticeship in 1458. Shortly after, in early 1462, he received a life grant of the office of engraver to the Tower of London and other English and Calais mints, which he held for twenty years. A successful member of his craft, he seems to have been primarily a working goldsmith all his life, referring to his shop, warehouse, and working houses in his testament. There is no evidence that he traded regularly overseas, and the small number of debts for which he sued indicates that he probably did not often act as a moneylender or mortgagee.<br>
<br>Like almost every other contemporary Londoner of note, however, Shaw lent money to Edward IV as part of an orchestrated loan in 1468, and subsequently he made several private loans, suggesting that his dealings with a fellow goldsmith, Hugh Brice, had brought him into closer association with the king. In addition to the craft connection between them, Brice had been appointed keeper of the Tower mint at about the same time as Shaw was made engraver, and in early 1469 Shaw was one of eight friends whom Brice persuaded to make further large loans to the king. Later that year Shaw lent &pound;240 by himself, and he continued to have both financial and commercial dealings with Edward IV thereafter.<br>
<br>According to Sir Thomas More (a biased source) Shaw was a proud and ambitious man. After two unsuccessful nominations for the London aldermanry, in September 1470 and June 1471, he was eventually elected alderman of Cripplegate ward in July 1473, and he became sheriff the following year. A member of the fraternity of St Giles, Cripplegate ward, he probably lived in that ward for most of his later life (as did his brother <a href="#cosubject_25265">Ralph [<i>see below</i>]</a>). None the less in 1485 he transferred to Cheap ward on the death of Sir Thomas Hill, whose testament he supervised. In 1482, having been the unsuccessful mayoral candidate the previous year, Shaw was elected mayor, and was therefore serving both when Edward IV died and throughout the tumultuous period leading up to the usurpation of Richard III.<br>
<br>It is for his role and assumed political attitude during this time that Shaw is mainly remembered. According to Sir Thomas More (writing in the years around 1515) and the sixteenth-century London chroniclers it was his brother <a name="cosubject_25265"></a><span class="headword">Ralph Shaw</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1484)<span class="occ"></span>, a Cambridge graduate, doctor of theology, and a canon of St Paul's, who preached a sermon at Paul's Cross, claiming that the then duke of Gloucester was the only lawful claimant to the throne. Reportedly he had formerly been a popular preacher, but so hostile was Dr Shaw's audience on this occasion that his death in the following year was said to have been due to chagrin at the cold reception accorded to his sermon. Edmund Shaw himself, as mayor, was extensively involved in the ceremonies surrounding the coronation of Richard III, and he was subsequently knighted and sworn of the privy council. The value of his commercial dealings with Richard and of the grants he received suggests that, at the very least, the king was keen to secure his support. Shaw survived Richard's downfall without apparent difficulty, however, and made no specific mention of or spiritual provision for his brother when he drew up his testament in March 1488.<br>
<br>Edmund Shaw died on 20 April 1488. One of his executors was his &#145;cousin&#146; John Shaw, also a goldsmith and a future mayor of London; another was his &#145;right especiall and tender loving Frende&#146;, Henry VII's close adviser Sir Reynold Bray  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/8/12). Shaw was buried in the mercers' chapel, St Thomas of Acon, but left numerous legacies both to his parish church, St Peter's, Westcheap, and to the inhabitants of Cripplegate ward, including a sum for the rebuilding of Cripplegate itself. Another legacy was intended to establish a grammar school in Stockport, Cheshire, where his parents were buried. Among those for whom he made arrangements for prayers to be said were Edward IV, Edward's sister Anne, duchess of Exeter, and Lord Herbert. Shaw held Essex properties worth over &pound;50 per annum at his death, equating to a purchase price of perhaps &pound;750&#150;&pound;1000, and bequeathed over &pound;4000 in cash and plate as well as personal and household effects. He was survived by his wife, Juliana, a son, Hugh, who died childless a few years later, daughters Margaret (married to a mercer, Thomas Rich) and Katherine (who later married William Brown, another mercer), as well as four sisters.<br>
