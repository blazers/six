<span class="headword">Vokes,  Frederick Mortimer</span>  (1846&#150;1888), <span class="occ">actor and dancer</span>, the son of Frederick Vokes, master of the wardrobe at the Surrey Theatre, and his wife, Sarah Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Godden, was born in London on 22 January 1846. He made his first appearance at the Surrey in 1854, as the boy in the farce <span class="italic">Seeing Wright</span>. Vokes and his two sisters Jessie and Victoria, subsequently joined by a third sister, Rosina, and by Walter Fawdon, who assumed the name of Vokes on joining the company, became known as the Vokes children, a name which they afterwards changed to the Vokes family. They made their joint d&eacute;but on 26 December 1861 at Howard's Operetta House, Edinburgh. After playing at the Alhambra, they returned for six years to provincial theatres and music halls. In December 1868 the family made a great sensation at the Lyceum in the pantomime <span class="italic">Humpty Dumpty</span>. It led to their engagement for the pantomime at Drury Lane, at which house the entire family appeared for the next ten years, playing always in the burlesque introduction and often in the harlequinade. In February 1870, in a farce at Drury Lane given by the Vokeses called <span class="italic">Phoebus's Fix</span>, Frederick Vokes sang a song by E. L. Blanchard, &#145;The Man on Wires&#146;. The same year he visited Paris, but had to leave on account of the Franco-Prussian War. In August 1875 <span class="italic">The Belles of the Kitchen</span>, a fanciful sketch that had previously been given at the Alhambra, was performed at the Adelphi with great success. In June 1876 the family produced at the same house Blanchard's <span class="italic">Bunch of Berries</span>, an altered version of which they presented at Brighton in April 1880. After the retirement of Rosina Vokes on her marriage, Frederick played with the remaining members of the family at the Aquarium Theatre in <span class="italic">The Rough Diamond</span> and <span class="italic">Fun in a Fog</span> in April 1879. The last appearance of the family in the Drury Lane pantomime was Christmas 1879. Most of its members were in the pantomime at Covent Garden in 1880. Vokes married Bella, the daughter of Thomas William Moore of the Moore and Burgess minstrels. She played occasionally as one of the family, particularly as a replacement for Rosina. Vokes made more than one visit with his sisters to the United States and Canada. In 1888 he was compelled by illness to forgo his engagements, and on 3 June he died of paralysis at the house of his sister Victoria. He was a fair comedian, a good dancer, and a wonderful pantomimist. With the rest of the Vokes family he was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28350"></a><span class="headword">Victoria Rosaline Sarah Vokes</span>  (1850/1853&#150;1894), <span class="occ">actress</span>, sister of Frederick Mortimer Vokes, was born in London. She appeared at the Surrey under Creswick as Genevi&egrave;ve in <span class="italic">The Avalanche</span> when scarcely two years old. She continued to share with her sisters all the child parts undertaken by the Vokes family, and became very popular as Albert in <span class="italic">William Tell</span> and the duke of York in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>; she played the latter part at the St James's Theatre with Barry Sullivan. Besides taking part in the performances of her family, she played, in February 1871 at Drury Lane, Amy Robsart in <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span>, owing to the illness of Lilian Adelaide Neilson. She had a good voice and sang effectively. Her performances in <span class="italic">The Belles of the Kitchen</span> and as Margery in <span class="italic">The Rough Diamond</span> were humorous and spirited. In November 1890 she appeared at the Shaftesbury, with a company organized by herself, in <span class="italic">My Lady Help</span>, a comedietta by Arthur Macklin. She died on 2 December 1894 at 16 Blenheim Road, Marylebone, London.<br>
<br>Another sister, <a name="cosubject_28348"></a><span class="headword">Jessie Catherine Biddulph Vokes</span>  (1851&#150;1884)<span class="occ"></span>, played juvenile parts at the Surrey, as Teddy in <span class="italic">Dred, or, The Dismal Swamp</span> and Florence in <span class="italic">The Dumb Savoyard</span>. Most popular were her roles of Mamillius in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> at Sadler's Wells and the prince of Wales in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, performed with Barry Sullivan at the St James's. She shared the fortunes of her family, with whom she played in Edinburgh, London, Paris, and America. She was a sprightly and accomplished dancer and an acceptable actress. She died at 16 London Road, Marylebone, London, on 4 August 1884, and her death contributed to the break up of the family.<br>
<br>A third sister, <a name="cosubject_28349"></a><span class="headword">(Theodocia) Rosina Vokes</span>  (1854&#150;1894)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 18 October 1854. She was the youngest, sprightliest, and most popular member of the Vokes family, and made her first public appearance at the Alhambra in <span class="italic">The Belles of the Kitchen</span>. With the rest of her family she took part in the performance of <span class="italic">Humpty Dumpty</span> at the Lyceum on 26 December 1868. The following Christmas she appeared under Chatterton at Drury Lane in the pantomime in which, in the small part of Fatima, she acquired a reputation for vivacity and witchery, which strengthened with each succeeding year. With her family she played at the Ch&acirc;telet in Paris until the approach of the German army compelled them to take to flight. At Drury Lane, in February 1870, she was Albert to the William Tell of Thomas King in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">William Tell</span>. On 10 March 1877 she married Cecil Clay, the author of <span class="italic">A Pantomime Rehearsal</span> and the brother of Frederick Clay, the composer of light operas. She then retired from the English stage. In October 1885, however, she was invited to America with her husband, and took over with her a small theatrical company, including Brandon Thomas, Weedon Grossmith, and other actors subsequently well known, and played in light comedy and burlesque. For nine consecutive years she made a tour of the principal cities of the United States and Canada, playing in G. W. Godfrey's <span class="italic">The Parvenu</span>, A. W. Pinero's <span class="italic">The Schoolmistress</span>, Grundy's <span class="italic">The Milliner's Bill</span>, and in <span class="italic">The Circus Rider</span>, <span class="italic">Maid Marian</span>, and <span class="italic">A Pantomime Rehearsal</span>. Her last tour was completed in 1893, and she died at Babbacombe, Torquay, on 27 January 1894. She had remarkable gifts in light comedy and in burlesque. Though the Vokeses all died young, their father lived to the age of seventy-four, dying on 4 June 1890, and their mother survived them all, living until 8 February 1897.<br>
