<span class="headword">Trew,  Ethel Mary</span>  (1869&#150;1948), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 24 April 1869 at Lilliput Hall, Oystermouth, Glamorgan, the sixth child of Thomas Trew (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1830), a grocer and later a coal and corn merchant, and his wife, Ellen Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bradford (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1836). Although the family was living in Wales in the year that Ethel went to high school they considered their family home to be the Somerset village of South Petherton. She entered the new Manchester high school about 1880, and reputedly lived in lodgings nearby. She appears to have started her teaching career immediately upon leaving school, and in 1894 she was teaching mathematics at the West Cornwall College, in Penzance. There she was influenced by the charismatic headmistress Marion Waller, and when in 1894 Waller became head of Queenswood&#151;a new Methodist girls' school in Clapham Park, London&#151;Trew went with her as an assistant mistress. Miss Waller left the school in 1897, to marry, and Miss Trew was offered the headship. She approached the job reluctantly and seems to have realized that in accepting it she was making a choice between the school on the one hand and marriage and a family of her own on the other. Under pressure from the directors to accept she gave in: &#145;with a pang of sorrow I realised even then how much I was giving up&#146;  (Watson, 20). In future she channelled all her considerable dynastic ambitions and maternal feelings into the making of Queenswood.<br>
<br>Ethel Trew involved herself in every detail of the developing school. Whether it was the minutiae of school management (it was said that she knew the location of every piece of furniture in the school), or the spiritual (she compiled the school prayerbook), or the pastoral&#151;as witnessed by her desire to get to know every girl personally and her habit of kissing them goodnight&#151;she was in complete command. She became the matriarch, the school her extended family. In return for her devotion she demanded unquestioning obedience from staff and students alike.<br>
<br>In her early years at Queenswood Miss Trew's dynamic personality served her well. While still at Clapham Park the school was already noted for its music, but practice sessions brought complaints from the neighbours and on one occasion the matter came to court. Accompanied by several of her girls Miss Trew won the case, apparently by shamelessly charming the judge. This charm worked on fathers too and was often deployed to persuade them to enrol their daughters in higher education. Though she accepted that marriage was the likely career for the majority of her pupils she believed firmly that each should be educated to the highest level permitted by her abilities. Fathers usually gave in to her&#151;she was furious on those rare occasions when she failed to convince them. Under her leadership the school moved in 1925 to its new, more spacious premises in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and she presided over its building programme, characteristically devoting most attention to the chapel. She also convinced the trustees to establish a preparatory school for the youngest girls.<br>
<br>Miss Trew ruled over her extended surrogate family with a firm but loving hand&#151;one girl described her as &#145;the benevolent despot &hellip; a bit of an emotional blackmailer&#146;  (Watson, 27). Her staff was completely at her mercy and she was known to demonstrate her power over them by belittling them in the girls' presence. Yet she was kind in time of illness or family trouble and valiant in her own conduct, surviving both a fire that destroyed her house in 1936 and a bomb that brought down her ceilings in 1944. She had endless supplies of sayings to encourage the development of character: &#145;find your niche and fill it&#146;, &#145;when you have put your hand to the plough, never turn back&#146;, and most famously, &#145;do your duty and a little more&#146;. Like most teachers of her generation she placed great emphasis upon physical health, mental purity, social conscience, lady-like manners, and especially self-control. Her interest in the latter probably stemmed from her own battles to control her quick temper and impulsive tongue  (ibid., 32). Some of her edicts, such as her successful ban on coughing in chapel, reflected her own formidable will-power, which kept her at her post despite frequent bouts of ill health. She recruited a talented staff and generally left them to get on with the business of teaching. Though the quality of instruction was high she never quite appreciated the importance of science teaching. However, this weakness in the curriculum did not prevent many of the girls choosing careers in nursing, although teaching was always the most common choice for Queenswood graduates.<br>
<br>The world moved on between the wars and Miss Trew did not. Increasingly the ageing headmistress, for all her powerful and contradictory charm, was losing touch with the realities of running a modern school. In 1935, under pressure from the trustees, she appointed an assistant headmistress, but allowed her little power. Though she had built a small house for her retirement (on the school estate) she was emotionally too involved with the school to be able to give it up. Her retirement was accomplished in slow and painful stages. She ceded the academic side of the school to her successor in 1943 but kept control of the domestic, social, and spiritual side. She also maintained control of the management of the estate even after she had formally retired in 1944. This proved disastrous, since a plausible estate manager cheated the school. Her final resignation took place in September 1948. She died shortly afterwards, at her home, Mymfield, Kentish Lane, Hatfield, on 7 December 1948 and was buried at South Petherton.<br>
<br>Memoirs of Miss Trew focus on her personality and her sayings rather than on her actions, for it was through the former that she exercised influence. Small in stature, she was nevertheless imposing. With her elegant furs and clothing (she favoured purple) she projected a regal dignity and was often likened to Queen Mary: &#145;she used to sail around the school&#146; accompanied by her two Cairn terriers  (Watson, 24). She had a distinctive voice, rather sharp, with the dropped &#145;h&#146; peculiar to the west country. She was imperious, charming, cruel when crossed or angered, kind, generous, and unexpectedly forthright and practical. Her rule was benevolent but absolute&#151;when she spoke of &#145;my girls&#146;, &#145;my staff&#146;, and &#145;my school&#146; she meant precisely what she said  (ibid., 22). Her tragedy was in staying on too long when changing times and her own failing powers of judgement let her down. In her prime she could madden with her certainties and her imperious manner, but she built a modern school, working within a social system that often limited girls' opportunities, using her force of personality to create openings for those who showed promise, and moulding her pupils to fit happily into the world as she found it. She subordinated her entire personality to the school and it is not unreasonable to say that for fifty years Ethel Trew was Queenswood.<br>
