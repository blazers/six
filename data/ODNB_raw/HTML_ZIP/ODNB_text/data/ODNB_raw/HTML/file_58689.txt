<span class="headword">Smith <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Veitch]</span>,  Zepherina Philadelphia</span>  (1836&#150;1894), <span class="occ">nurse and social reformer</span>, was born on 1 April 1836 at Sopley, Hampshire, the elder daughter of the Revd William Douglas Veitch (1802?&#150;1884), vicar of St Saviour's, Paddington, London (1862&#150;73). Both her parents took an interest in the social welfare of the working class and, like many young women of her class and generation, Zepherina was determined to do something useful with her life. Recent reforms had raised the status of nursing as a suitable occupation for ladies and in 1867 Zepherina went to University College, London, to train as a nurse under the All Saints sisters. In the following year she was placed in charge of the surgical wards at King's College Hospital and in 1869 was made superintendent of nurses at St George's Hospital. After a few months she resigned this appointment and took a variety of temporary hospital posts before leaving England in September 1870 to work with the All Saints sisters in Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War. She wrote about her experiences of nursing abroad in letters to her sister, extracts from which were published after her death in the <span class="italic">Nursing Notes</span> (November 1894). In 1870 she published <span class="italic">A Handbook for Nursing the Sick</span>, which reached a second edition in 1876. Rosalind Paget, one of the leaders of the Midwives' Institute, described it as the best book for nurses that existed.<br>
<br>On her return to England, Zepherina Veitch became interested in improving the practice of midwifery and the status of midwives, most of whom received little or no training. She qualified as a midwife in January 1873 at the British Lying-In Hospital, Endell Street, and became only the tenth person to obtain the diploma of the London Obstetrical Society (LOS). She continued to work in hospitals, but her mother's ill health meant that she tended to stand in for others rather than taking up a permanent post. Her employment as a professional nurse ended when she married a widower, the surgeon Henry Smith (<i>b</i>. 1822/3), son of William Smith, a solicitor, in December 1876.<br>
<br>After her marriage Zepherina Smith put her energies into the cause of midwifery reform. Her aim was to improve the status and efficiency of midwives; she emphasized the importance of training, and argued that a woman should not be able to call herself a midwife unless she was properly trained. She hoped to see well-educated, middle-class women take up the work, not only so that there would be an improved midwifery service for the poor, but also so that midwives could be an &#145;influence for good&#146; on working-class families. Smith's activities should be seen in the context of the development of a women's movement in the middle decades of the nineteenth century which sought to expand educational and employment opportunities for single, middle-class women. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that when she submitted an article on midwifery to the <span class="italic">Women's Gazette</span> she immediately came to the attention of the editor, Louisa Hubbard, who took an interest in expanding women's work opportunities and in improving their employment conditions. Zepherina Smith was one of seven midwives, all holders of the LOS diploma, who were called to a meeting by Hubbard in December 1881 to form the Matron's Aid Society, with the aim of improving the training of midwives and securing their registration by act of parliament. The name was chosen because the word &#145;midwife&#146; was rarely used in &#145;polite&#146; society, but by the late 1880s the members of the society were confident enough to change the name to the Midwives' Institute (which became the Royal College of Midwives in 1948). Zepherina Smith was the treasurer of the society, which had only a handful of members at the beginning, until it was incorporated in 1889. She then became its first president, serving from 1890 until her death.<br>
<br>Zepherina Smith worked tirelessly to promote the cause of midwife training and registration and used her wide range of personal contacts to good effect. She represented the institute on deputations to the government, and when a committee sat to frame the first <span class="roman">Midwives' Bill</span> in 1890 she was asked to attend the sittings to watch proceedings from the point of view of the midwife. This was a new departure, since midwives were rarely asked for their opinions. She also gave evidence to the select committee on midwifery in 1892 and delivered numerous papers to clubs and societies on the subject of midwife registration.<br>
<br>Smith was remembered by friends and colleagues as an eloquent speaker with a bright face and a cheery word for everyone. Her sister recalled that Zepherina found that early years spent in Palestine had taught her how to be adaptable, a skill which was invaluable when nursing in difficult circumstances without the resources of a hospital. On one occasion when she had to attend a very poor patient in her own home she found that there was nothing bigger than a meat tin in which to hold water. &#145;She at once solved the question of how to wash the baby by making a bath in her lap of a big waterproof apron she wore&#146;  (Paget). After several months of ill health Zepherina Smith died on 8 February 1894 at her home, Summerhill, Horsell, near Woking, Surrey.<br>
