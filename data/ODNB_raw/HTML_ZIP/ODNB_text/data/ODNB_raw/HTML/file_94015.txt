<span class="headword">Morgan,  Joan</span>  (1905&#150;2004), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 1 February 1905 at 13 St Germans Road, Forest Hill, London, the only child of Sidney Arthur Morgan (1874&#150;1946), property owner, but soon also a prominent film director, and his wife, Evelyn, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood, actress. At the age of eight her blonde beauty attracted the attention of the American film producer Charles Urban, who cast her in <span class="italic">Little Lord Fauntleroy</span>, to be made in Kinemacolor. Elaborate costumes had been completed when Urban received notice from the solicitor of Frances Hodgson Burnett that he was in breach of copyright. The project was abruptly cancelled. She was given a role in another colour film, made in Marseilles, and was subsequently hired by the producer Joe Bamberger at a considerable drop in salary&#151;30 shillings a week instead of 50. Like most children in show business she had a patchy education, but her father passed on to her his enthusiasm for literature. An essay of hers was rejected by <span class="italic">The Times</span>, whose staff refused to believe it had been written by a child under ten.<br>
<br>During the First World War Sidney Morgan sent his wife and child to America. The voyage was an enormous risk; the <i>Lusitania</i> had been torpedoed only six months before. Joan Morgan worked at the studios at Fort Lee, New Jersey, where she played in <span class="italic">The Reapers</span> (1916), a film she remembered as outstanding. She and her mother returned to England so she could play Ellen Terry's granddaughter in <span class="italic">Her Greatest Performance</span> (1917). She was then enrolled in the Italia Conti stage school, where Andr&eacute; Charlot selected her for two revues; she recalled that these took place during air raids, and that she went on stage with the barrage going on overhead, announcing what the next sketch was going to be.<br>
<br>When the war was over Sidney Morgan took over a tiny studio on Shoreham Beach in Sussex, where he was a producer for the Progress Film Company. In this glass house among the pebbles, Joan Morgan felt she did her best work as an actress of the silent cinema: <span class="italic">Lady Noggs&#151;Peeress</span> (1920), &#145;about a bossy little aristocrat going around doing good&#146;, and <span class="italic">Little Dorrit</span> (1920), a lovingly made adaptation that brought Morgan her most glowing notices. When the American Famous Players&#150;Lasky firm opened a studio at Islington, London, they hired her&#151;at &pound;30 a week&#151;to play with Bryant Washburn in <span class="italic">The Road to London</span> (1921). She fell in love with him, and he helped persuade Famous Players&#150;Lasky to offer her a five-year contract in America, worth $100 a week, but her father turned it down, fearing the break-up of the family and the loss of his star. Still aged only fifteen, she deferred to his wishes, though she continued to regard it as a missed opportunity.<br>
<br>Morgan was hired by another American director to appear in Rider Haggard's <span class="italic">Swallow</span> (1922), shot on location in South Africa. Her career failed to flourish in England, however, and she and her mother went to America in the unsuccessful hope of recapturing the kind of offer her father had rejected. Back in London, she was given stage roles, and her father cast her in <span class="italic">Shadow of Egypt</span> (1924). The company went on location to Luxor, but she had to stay at home, her father being concerned about showing &#145;favouritism&#146; to his daughter. The Shoreham studios burned down in 1922, her parents separated in 1926, and Joan lived with her mother. Her last important silent cinema role was in her father's <span class="italic">Window in Piccadilly</span> (1928). She was only twenty-three.<br>
<br>Sound pictures needed new faces, and although she made one &#145;talkie&#146;, <span class="italic">Her Reputation</span> (1932), Joan Morgan was no longer in demand as an actress. She fell back on her talent as a writer, and wrote film scripts (of which the most successful was <span class="italic">The Flag Lieutenant</span>, 1932) under the pen names of Iris North and Joan Wentworth Wood. Her play <span class="italic">This was a Woman</span> was a success in London in 1944 and in Paris in 1947. Her first novel, <span class="italic">Citizen of Westminster</span>, was published in 1940, as was <span class="italic">Camera!</span>, the best book about the early British film industry. While undertaking war work at the Ministry of Supply (1942&#150;4) she wrote a book about evacuees, <span class="italic">Ding Dong Dell</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Between 1958 and 1977 Morgan specialized in property conversions&#151;she wrote about her experiences in <span class="italic">The Casebook of Capability Morgan</span> (1965). Her account of the story of Mary Blandy, who was hanged at Oxford in 1752, <span class="italic">The Hanging Wood</span> (1950), was adapted by the BBC in 1977 for their <span class="italic">A Question of Guilt</span> series. Although engaged once or twice, she never married and lived alone in a tiny toll-house at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. She died at Thamesfield nursing home, Wargrave Road, Henley, on 22 July 2004.<br>
