<span class="headword">Saunders,  Thomas Harry</span>  (1813&#150;1870), <span class="occ">paper manufacturer</span>, was born in Limehouse, London, on 19 September 1813, the youngest in the family of two sons and three daughters of John Saunders, hoop bender, and his wife, Mary. Very little is known about his early life. He seems to have entered the paper-making trade in the late 1830s at a boom time and eventually owned six paper mills in Kent and Buckinghamshire, branching out from the family businesses of coal and timber merchants and, especially, seed crushing. His first partnership in a paper mill was in 1840 in Hawley, south of Dartford on the Darent. On 11 July 1844 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Bold Marchant of Brenchley in Kent. There were no children.<br>
<br>Saunders's mills had a reputation for supplying everything from newsprint (for <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the 1850s and 1860s) to security paper, in which he built up a huge export business to Europe, the British empire, and South America for stamps and banknotes (his customers included almost all the best-known banks). His name is first found in the watermark of a postage stamp for Barbados as early as 1840. The quality of his paper is confirmed by the fact that he exhibited, and won some twelve prize medals, at international exhibitions from 1851 onwards, though not at the more parochial trade shows. In the run-up to the Great Exhibition of 1851 he produced sample sheets with a watermarked light and shade portrait of Queen Victoria: later these exquisite watermarks became part of his stock-in-trade and were described as a &#145;degree of perfection &hellip; the quintessence of the papermaking craft&#146;. More prosaically it was predicted that they could &#145;form a valuable addition to bank note paper for the prevention of forgery&#146;.<br>
<br>Saunders's business expanded entirely by acquisition. One of his mills was probably the largest in the country by the 1880s, though it seems not to have been a paper mill when he acquired it. He rebuilt the Phoenix mill in Dartford as one of the major industrial buildings in the south-east of England. During his career he created an &#145;immense, flourishing and progressive business&#146; of six mills with some eighteen hand-making vats and three paper machines.<br>
<br>On the national scene, during the 1860s Saunders was twice in small deputations to the prime minister, the third Viscount Palmerston, concerning controversy about the abolition of paper duties and the continuing import duties on rags. His evidence to the parliamentary select committee revealed that he was not one of those who believed that straw could ever be an adequate substitute for rags. In 1862, with his mill manager, he took out a patent on an improved way of drying machine-made paper and of regulating the supply of pulp to the paper machine. He was an active nonconformist of Baptist tendencies and employed a metropolitan missionary to preach indoors and out. His substantial charitable activities included strong support of the Shaftesbury Society (though this did not stop his widow owning a public house next to one of the mills). He was also a member of the Royal Society of Arts.<br>
<br>Saunders died on 5 February 1870 at Spring Wood, Dartford, following a debilitating stroke two years earlier which had put an end to his trade activities. His estate was valued at under &pound;120,000.<br>
