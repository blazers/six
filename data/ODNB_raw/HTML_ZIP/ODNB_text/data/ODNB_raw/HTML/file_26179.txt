</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rice,  Thomas  Spring</span>, first Baron Monteagle of Brandon  (1790&#150;1866), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 8 February 1790 at 21 Mungret Street, Limerick, the elder son of Stephen Edward Rice (<i>d</i>. 1831) of Mount Trenchard, co. Limerick, and his wife, Catherine, daughter and sole heir of Thomas Spring of Ballycrispin, co. Kerry.<br>
<br>Spring Rice was born into a well-connected Irish gentry family (his paternal grandmother was a daughter of the knight of Kerry) only recently converted to protestantism. He matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1809. His university career was terminated prematurely by his marriage on 11 July 1811 to Theodosia (1787&#150;1839), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22005/', "Edmond Henry Pery, the first earl of Limerick")</script>. They produced eight children while he studied law and laid the foundations for a political career. Spring Rice was a kind and generous parent, a loving husband, and a responsible landlord.<br>
<br>In 1820 Spring Rice won a seat in parliament for Limerick. He continued to sit for his native town until the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> (1832) made his return there unlikely and he transferred to Cambridge where he remained for the rest of his Commons career. Spring Rice came to the notice of the third marquess of Lansdowne, who remained his patron for many years. The Bowood House circle mixed Benthamite utilitarianism and <i>laissez-faire</i> economics with traditional constitutional whiggism. The members had literary tastes: Spring Rice loved poetry and contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. They were frightened by even a hint of boldness in the advocacy of reform. Spring Rice followed his leader into Canning's coalition ministry as under-secretary for the Home Office in July 1827, even though this required accepting deferral of Catholic emancipation. He resigned in January 1828 from the brief administration that followed Canning's death, although he had hoped to keep the centrist amalgamation together almost at any cost.<br>
<br>When the whigs returned to power as a unified party in November 1830, Spring Rice was made secretary of the Treasury. He worked closely with Lord Althorp on budgetary policy. In a government with a weak front bench in terms of speaking talent, his fluent debating style was much valued. In 1833 he expressed interest in gaining election as speaker, and made successive quests for the position in 1834&#150;5, 1837, and 1838&#150;9. His continual canvass for the chair made him increasingly unpopular in the House of Commons. He turned down the Irish secretaryship in May 1833, but was appointed colonial secretary with a seat in the cabinet after Stanley's resignation in 1834. In the latter position he did little to head off trouble in Canada, although his lifelong attachment to the anti-slavery movement and friendship with Thomas Fowell Buxton helped smooth the process of emancipation.<br>
<br>Spring Rice succeeded Althorp as chancellor of the exchequer after Peel's abortive attempt to form a government collapsed in April 1835. He was widely regarded as not up to the job both by contemporaries and later historians, and admitted his own &#145;inadequacy&#146;  (Murphy, 133&#150;4; <span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 3.332, 4.19). His <span class="roman">Church Rate Bill</span> of 1837 was ignominiously abandoned, and his attempt to revise the charter of the Bank of Ireland was also a humiliating fiasco. His budgets were pedestrian, adequate when trade remained favourable and expenditures were controlled, but depression and crop failures, combined with rebellion in North America and the compensation charges due to plantation owners in the West Indies, created large deficits. In 1839 he departed from office in the face of withering criticism, consoled by a peerage (5 September 1839). In the Lords he was an active but peripheral figure.<br>
<br>Lady Theodosia died soon after her husband's resignation, and on 13 April 1841 Spring Rice married Mary Anne (1800&#150;1889), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37739/', "John Marshall")</script>, the Leeds industrialist. His second wife's fortune came in the nick of time. The Limerick estate had never been sufficient to support the family without the supplement of an official salary. Then the terrible famine of the 1840s wiped out much of Spring Rice's Irish income, and he spent the remainder on ameliorative measures. He responded to the catastrophe with compassion and intelligence. He lectured the men responsible for relief, especially Bessborough, Wood, Russell, and Trevelyan, about the condition of the starving masses and the necessity for effective remedies, urging the abandonment of the economic theories he had upheld for a lifetime in face of the immediate need &#145;to keep society together&#146;  (Howell-Thomas, 297, 308).<br>
<br>Spring Rice was a conventionally devout Anglican &#145;in a lowish sort of way&#146;  (Hilton, 237) who led his family in regular prayers and scripture readings, but he was ecumenical in the political and educational controversies surrounding religion, most notably in his support for appropriation of surplus revenues from the Church of Ireland to lay purposes. In 1835 Spring Rice declared that a &#145;clergy without flocks and parsons without congregations were scandals which endangered the existence of the Protestant establishment&#146;  (Murphy, 111). He believed moral and religious education was &#145;the greatest of all national duties&#146;  (Brent, 58, 246). Historians disagree about the extent of his commitment to state-supported education. Some see his role as central to the formation of whig policy in this area during the 1820s and 1830s  (Newbould, 281; Paz, 70&#150;71). Others question his commitment and cite his &#145;niggardly&#146; allocation of funds to support innovation  (Mandler, 183, 188, 190&#150;91).<br>
<br>Spring Rice was a strong unionist and even went so far as to suggest in 1834, in a parliamentary speech which he later published, that Ireland be renamed &#145;West Britain&#146;  (Brent, 51). He feared repeal legislation would unleash dangerous conflict between the upper and lower classes in an already fragile social order. By showing what Lord Holland called &#145;injudicious reluctance&#146; in conceding reductions in the stamp duty on newspapers and when introducing the penny post (1839), he alienated Liberal and radical opinion  (Holland, 409). He took pride in his traditional whiggism, which, he told the poet Wordsworth, he &#145;had not added to &hellip; nor taken therefrom&#146; over his whole career  (Newbould, 316). His conservative opinions made him more comfortable with the Canningites and the &#145;Derby Dilly&#146; than the mainstream of his party. It was characteristic of both his politics and his need for cash that he spent his last years enjoying the proceeds of the comptrollership of the exchequer, one of few sinecures that had survived from the era of &#145;Old Corruption&#146;, and was only dislodged from it in 1865 by Gladstone's determined efforts. He was never fully welcomed into the circle of the whig grandees and remained more Lansdowne's prot&eacute;g&eacute; than friend. One grandee thought so little of Spring Rice's dignity that he leap-frogged over his back in the lobby of the House of Commons. Though as a young man he had once escaped the Dublin police bent on preventing a duel by disguising himself as a servant and hiding on a roof-top, his life was otherwise curiously devoid of incident and enterprise. He left a blank silhouette on a political landscape teeming with colourful and distinguished characters. The diarist Charles Greville judged him &#145;indolent but full of vivacity&#146;. He chaired the royal commission on decimal coinage from 1855 to 1859, when he resigned following parliamentary criticisms of the commissioners' slowness in producing a report. He was a commissioner of the state paper office, a trustee of the National Gallery, a member of the senate of the University of London and of the Queen's University in Ireland, and FRS and FGS  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Spring Rice enjoyed the ease and privilege of the London cultural and political worlds, but he was ultimately unwilling to pay the cost of his pleasures by bearing the burden of ministerial responsibility. He died in Ireland at Mount Trenchard, co. Limerick, on 7 February 1866, and was buried at Shanagolden, co. Limerick.<br>
