<span class="headword">Gerarde,  Derrick</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1550&#150;1590), <span class="occ">composer and copyist</span>, was probably of Flemish origin. Although virtually nothing is known of his life, there is strong circumstantial evidence for believing that he spent some time in England. Almost his entire musical output is contained in manuscripts now in the Royal Appendix sequence of the British Library. The fact that so many of these can be traced back to the library established by Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel (1512&#150;1580), and his son-in-law John, Lord Lumley (1534&#150;1609), suggests that Gerarde had personal contact with their household. Both men were sympathetic patrons of the arts, and their country residence at Nonsuch, Surrey, was a flourishing centre of continental music and culture. Two sets of partbooks emanating from Nonsuch contain a work with English text&#151;&#145;Yf Phebus Stormes&#146; and &#145;Lorde be my judge&#146;&#151;apparently by Gerarde. He copied Royal Appendix 57 (the only surviving partbook of another Nonsuch set) using printed music paper thought to have been produced in England in the 1560s. A textless chanson or instrumental piece, &#145;Chera la fountayne&#146;, is attributed to &#145;Gerardus&#146; in British Library, Add. MS 31390, a manuscript of English provenance, and his motet <span class="italic">Sive vigilem</span> appears in Oxford, Christ Church, MSS 979&#150;983, a collection that, with one exception, contains music by British composers or foreigners working in Britain. However, there is no documentary proof that Gerarde ever directly enjoyed the patronage of either Arundel or Lumley, and it has even been suggested that they acquired some of his manuscripts secondhand. While admitting this as a possibility, it seems more likely that he was employed at Nonsuch in some capacity.<br>
<br>Gerarde's manuscripts constitute one of the largest collections of polyphony by a single composer to have survived from the Elizabethan era. A number of these are autographs and preserve reworkings of his pieces, often in the form of new staves pasted over the old versions, which afford a fascinating insight into the compositional processes of a Renaissance musician. His large and varied output is international in scope, with instrumental pieces, Italian madrigals and villanellas, chansons, liturgical pieces for four to ten voices, and a number of secular motets. His finely crafted music is typical of the generation of Lassus, with smoothly flowing lines and declamatory passages occasionally enlivened by touches of chromaticism. The style is seen at its best in his <span class="italic">Dulces exuviae</span>, a setting of Dido's final words from book 4 of Virgil's <span class="italic">Aeneid</span>, which achieves a remarkably powerful effect for all its technical restraint.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of Gerarde's career before coming to England, and attempts to identify him with one of the many musicians of that name working on the continent have produced only speculative results. He may have arrived in England as early as the reign of Queen Mary, when Arundel was in the Low Countries as ambassador to Philip of Spain, or in the mid-1560s as a musician acquired by the earl on his visit to the baths at Padua. After Arundel's death Gerarde may have sought alternative employment, and he is possibly the &#145;Gerrard Direck&#146; alias &#145;Direck Gerrerd&#146; who was a singing man at York Minster from about 1590 until his death in 1604. Conceivably, he may also be the &#145;Derrick&#146; whose English service music appears in early seventeenth-century manuscripts at Cambridge and Durham, and the composer of &#145;Mr Dethicks Pavin&#146; in British Library, Add. MSS 30826&#150;30828, another Cambridge source.<br>
