<span class="headword">Langham,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1535&#150;1579/80), <span class="occ">mercer</span>, was reputedly the author of a description of the entertainment given by Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, for Elizabeth I at Kenilworth Castle in the summer of 1575. All that is known for certain about him is that he was apprenticed to William Leonard and admitted to the freedom of the Mercers' Company in 1557, so that he was probably born in the mid-1530s. He received payments of &pound;10 each April from 1573 to 1579 as keeper of the council chamber: on 13 April 1580 the sum was paid to his widow for his pains during the last year, and on 29 November of the same year letters of administration were granted to his widow, Mary, of the parish of St Mildred in Bread Street ward.<br>
<br>The description of the entertainment has the title <span class="italic">A letter: whearin, part of the entertainment vntoo the Queenz Maiesty, at Killingwoorth Castl, in Warwik Sheer in this soomerz progress 1575. iz signified: from a freend officer attendant in the coourt, vntoo hiz freend a citizen, and merchaunt of London</span>. It usefully complements the description given of &#145;The princelie pleasures at Kenelworth Castle&#146; by George Gascoigne, one of their devisers, in an account of 1576, which survives in his <span class="italic">Whole Works</span> of 1587. The <span class="italic">Letter</span> also supplies a list of books owned by Captain Cox, a Coventry mason and leader of the Hock-Tuesday play; it is an important source for the ballads, romances, plays, and popular literature of the time. The account has been well known since it was reprinted at Warwick in 1784; it was included in John Nichols's editions of <span class="italic">The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth</span> (1788 and 1823). Scott drew on it in his novel <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span> (1821), in which Langham makes an appearance as a minor character.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Letter</span> survives in two editions; neither supplies any information about who printed them, when or where, but they may have been printed about 1578 and after 1580. An earlier edition, published shortly after &#145;this soomerz progress&#146; in 1575, may have been suppressed. The <span class="italic">Letter</span>, dated from Worcester on 20 August 1575, is addressed to Humfrey Martyn, the son of Sir Roger Martyn, a master of the Mercers' Company: Humfrey Martyn, younger and richer than Langham, was admitted to the company by patrimony in 1570 and to the livery on 23 July 1572. The two were evidently only recently acquainted, which allows Langham to tell Martyn a certain amount about himself. In the course of the <span class="italic">Letter</span> the writer refers to himself as &#145;Lanham&#146; or &#145;Laneham&#146;, &#145;Langham&#146;, &#145;Ro. La.&#146;, and &#145;R. L. Gent. Mercer&#146;, as well as &#145;the blak Prins&#146; or &#145;El prencipe negro&#146;  (Langham, 58, 78, 36, 80).<br>
<br>Making use of a distinctive orthography, the writer of the <span class="italic">Letter</span> is portrayed as an egocentric and amiable buffoon, with antiquarian tastes and a love for old stories, for music and dancing, and for food and drink. The <span class="italic">Letter</span> supplies further biographical details. Langham was educated at St Anthony's and St Paul's schools in London, was apprenticed to &#145;Master Bomsted&#146;, travelled in France and Flanders with Bomsted and on his own, and learned foreign languages, including Spanish, through his business. He is described as a &#145;Merchauntaventurer, and Clark of the Councell chamber doore&#146;: an account of his day in this last office is supplied. Leicester is referred to as his patron who got him the post with the privy council as well as a &#145;licenz of Beanz&#146; which, he adds, he needs to use much  (Langham, 36, 76, 80); his father is said to be a servant of the earl in his stables. In London after work he frequents the establishments of Sir George Howard and Lady Sidney. His friends are stated to include Thomas Pullison, a merchant and future lord mayor of London, Thomas Smith, customer of the port of London, a &#145;Master thorogood&#146; (perhaps William Thoroughgood of St Antholin, Budge Row), and another mercer, Thomas Denman.<br>
<br>Some of these details have a circumstantial plausibility. An Edward Langham, gentleman, was granted livery by the earl of Leicester in 1559, received payments for supplying food for his hawks, and served him in Ireland. A John Laneham was an actor and member of Leicester's theatrical company in 1572&#150;4; later he joined the Queen's Men, of which he became a leading member, and was involved in the Marprelate controversy. &#145;Master Bomsted&#146; can be identified with Christopher Bompsted, who had been freed as an apprentice mercer in 1541. No independent record, however, can be found of Robert Langham as a pupil at either of the two schools, the post of clerk of the council chamber door is otherwise unknown, and no licence for beans has been found.<br>
<br>The question of the authorship of the <span class="italic">Letter</span> has been much debated. Its editor, R. J. P. Kuin, has argued that it is an authentic account by Langham, but others (David Scott and Brian O'Kill) believe that it is the work of William Patten, who published it as a joke at Langham's expense: this second view has been accepted by some authorities, including the <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue</span> and the revisers of Halkett and Laing's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Publications</span> (1980). The argument for Patten's authorship is based on several elements. These include similarities of form, style, subject matter, and phraseology shared between the <span class="italic">Letter</span> and Patten's acknowledged work; Patten's practice of annotating his own publications and the resemblance between his hand and the hand which appears in the two annotated copies of the <span class="italic">Letter</span>; the fact that Patten himself played a part in the Kenilworth festivities, contributing some Latin verses, which Gascoigne records as by &#145;M. Paten&#146;, to welcome the queen; and the distinctive orthography and language of the <span class="italic">Letter</span>, which shares forms and a fondness for archaisms and coinages used by Patten in his works. Finally, a letter from Patten to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, dated from London on 10 September 1575, among the Hatfield House papers, relates how he has heard from his &#145;good freend&#146; the master of requests, Thomas Wilson, &#145;hoow the book waz too be supprest for that Langham had complaynd vpon it, and ootherwize for that the honorabl enterteinment be not turned intoo a iest&#146;. Patten reports that he has sent out six copies of the book (to Burghley, to Wilson, and to the lord keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon), and has &#145;not let three more pass me, but haue &amp; suppress them all&#146;. Langham has seen a copy and Patten professes himself &#145;sory &hellip; that he takez it so noow&#146;  (Hatfield House, MS 8/52).<br>
<br>These strong arguments in favour of Patten's authorship leave a number of questions unanswered about his possible motivation in wishing to mock Langham, the dangers he ran of causing offence to those powerful people and institutions satirized by association in the <span class="italic">Letter</span>, and about Burghley's part in the events. Furthermore, Patten was not the only writer of the time to make use of distinctive phonetic forms (John Cornet and Leonard Staveley favoured a similar style) and archaic vocabulary, and, if he did annotate copies of the <span class="italic">Letter</span>, it does not necessarily follow that he wrote it. The circumstances in which the account was reprinted before and after Langham's death are unexplained. If the suppressed edition to which Patten refers was identical with the surviving text of the <span class="italic">Letter</span>, then it must have been printed and called in between 20 August and 10 September 1575. It is possible, however, either that the text of the <span class="italic">Letter</span> published and suppressed in 1575 was different from the one that survives in the later prints, or that Patten wrote a work, now lost, mocking Langham's account of Kenilworth which had to be withdrawn. Finally, although the <span class="italic">Letter</span> presents Langham in a comic light, it does so mainly in the last two or three out of just under ninety pages, and some of the mockery can be read as self-mockery.<br>
