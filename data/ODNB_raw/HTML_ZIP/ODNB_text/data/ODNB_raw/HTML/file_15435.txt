<span class="headword">Keogh,  William Nicholas</span>  (1817&#150;1878), <span class="occ">judge</span>, belonged to a Roman Catholic family formerly settled at Keoghville, co. Roscommon. He was born at Galway on 7 December 1817. His father, William M. Keogh (<i>d</i>. 1865), was a solicitor and sometime clerk of the crown for the county of Kilkenny; his mother was Mary, daughter of Austin Ffrench of Rahoon, co. Galway. He was educated at the Revd Dr Huddard's school in Mountjoy Square, Dublin, and in 1832 entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained honours in science in his first and second years. He left in his third year without having taken a degree. While at Trinity he was a frequent speaker in the debates of the Historical Society, and was awarded the first prize for oratory at the age of nineteen. In 1835 he was admitted a student of the King's Inns, Dublin, and in 1837 of Lincoln's Inn. In 1840 he was called to the Irish bar, and joined the Connaught circuit, where his family connections lay. In the same year he published, with Michael J. Barry, <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Practice of the High Court of Chancery in Ireland</span>, but he never obtained any considerable practice in that court. His natural gifts were those of an advocate rather than of a lawyer; a powerful voice, an impressive face, and an impassioned delivery were combined with a ready flow of vigorous and ornate language.<br>
<br>Keogh soon acquired a fair practice, principally on circuit, where, as a junior, he held leading briefs in the most important cases, and his powers of advocacy were considered so formidable that special counsel were sometimes brought down to oppose him. In 1841 he married Kate, daughter of Thomas Roney, surgeon; they had a son and a daughter. At the general election of 1847 he was returned for Athlone as an independent Conservative, the only Roman Catholic Conservative elected to that parliament. After a time he was considered a Peelite. In 1849 he was made a QC. In 1851 he took an active and prominent part in the obstructive parliamentary campaign of the Irish brigade against the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span>. This greatly increased his reputation and popularity in Ireland. He was the principal speaker at a mass meeting of Roman Catholics held in Dublin in August 1851 to protest against the measure, and was one of the founders of the Catholic Defence Association established in consequence of it. In the same month, together with the other members of the Irish brigade, he made common cause with the tenant right movement led by Charles Gavan Duffy, and in the session of 1852 seconded in the House of Commons the <span class="roman">Tenant Right Bill</span> of William Sharman Crawford. At the general election of 1852 he was again returned for Athlone, and he was subsequently among those MPs who assembled in Dublin and committed themselves to remain independent of, and in opposition to, any and every government that did not concede to their policy demands on land and religion. In December 1852 Keogh and the bulk of the Irish party voted in the majority which overturned Lord Derby's ministry. In the new ministry of Lord Aberdeen (December 1852) Keogh accepted office as solicitor-general for Ireland, while John Sadleir MP for Carlow, became a junior Treasury minister. The two men's names were thenceforth linked in obloquy by nationalist propagandists who accused them of betraying, through personal ambition, a policy and a party to which they were solemnly pledged. Subsequently their defection came to be depicted as the cause of a generation of Irish youth rejecting constitutional politics and embracing Fenianism. At the time Keogh was bitterly assailed by Gavan Duffy in <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and by Frederick Lucas in <span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, and his re-election for Athlone was opposed. His appointment was also distasteful to the Conservatives, and was attacked by Lord Westmeath in the House of Lords. At Athlone he was supported by the Catholic bishop (Dr Browne) and clergy, and was re-elected by a large majority. In January 1855 the Aberdeen ministry resigned and in Palmerston's ministry Keogh was appointed attorney-general for Ireland and was sworn of the Irish privy council. He was re-elected at Athlone without opposition. In April 1856, on the death of Mr Justice Torrens, he was appointed a judge of the court of common pleas in Ireland. Among the remarkable cases in which he was counsel while at the bar were <i>Birch v. Somerville</i> (December 1851), an action by the proprietor of <span class="italic">The World</span> newspaper against the Irish chief secretary on an alleged agreement to pay him for supporting law and order in his paper; <i>Handcock v. Delacour</i>, in the court of chancery (February 1855), a case involving the title to a large estate in Galway, in which Keogh's reply for the plaintiff was so touching and eloquent as to draw tears from the chancellor; and <i>R. v. Petcherine</i> (December 1855), the trial of a Redemptorist monk on a charge of profanely and contemptuously burning a copy of the Authorized Version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>; Keogh conducted the prosecution as attorney-general.<br>
<br>On the bench Keogh soon acquired the reputation of a judge of ability and discernment. Though not a profound lawyer, he never failed to appreciate a legal argument, and his judgments were clear and to the point. He excelled in the trial of <i>nisi prius</i> cases; his perception was quick, he grasped the facts of the case rapidly, and presented them to the jury with clearness and precision. In 1865 he was appointed, with Mr Justice Fitzgerald, to the special commission for the trial of the Fenian prisoners at Dublin and Cork, and before them Luby, O'Leary, O'Donovan Rossa, and the other principal conspirators were tried. Luby, in his speech after conviction, acknowledged the fairness of Keogh's summing-up to the jury. In 1867 the University of Dublin conferred upon him the honorary degree of LLD. In 1872 the celebrated Galway county election petition was tried before him. The candidates at the election were Captain J. P. Nolan (home-ruler) and Captain Le Poer Trench (Conservative); the former was returned by a large majority. His return was petitioned against mainly on the ground of undue influence exercised on his behalf by the Roman Catholic clergy. The trial lasted from 1 April to 27 May, and resulted in Captain Nolan being unseated, and three Roman Catholic bishops and thirty-one priests were reported to the house as guilty of undue influence and intimidation. That Captain Nolan was properly unseated on the evidence could hardly be contested, but in the course of his judgment Keogh commented on the action of the Roman Catholic bishops and priests in terms of unusual severity. His remarks were deeply resented, and aroused much popular feeling. Meetings were held at which he was denounced, he was burnt in effigy in numerous places, and the excitement became so great that special precautions had to be taken by the government for his protection. In the House of Commons Isaac Butt, the home-rule leader, brought forward a motion impugning the conduct of the judge; it was defeated by a large majority, only twenty-three voting in its favour (9 August 1872). For the remainder of his life Keogh was the subject of constant attack by the Home Rule Party. In 1878 his health began to fail, and he died at Bingen-on-the-Rhine on 30 September that year, some weeks after suffering a wound which may have been self-inflicted. He was buried on 3 October in the Catholic cemetery at Bonn.<br>
<br>During the greater part of his tenure of office, Keogh had been one of the most conspicuous figures on the Irish bench. Genial and good-natured, he was popular in private life, where his ready wit and conversational powers made him an agreeable companion; he possessed an unusually retentive memory, and his fund of anecdotes was varied and entertaining. Although his attitudes had come to be strongly anti-clerical, Keogh's closest friend in the last decade of his life was James Healy, parish priest of Little Bray, co. Dublin, and a celebrated wit, and Keogh is believed to have received the last rites devoutly on his deathbed.<br>
