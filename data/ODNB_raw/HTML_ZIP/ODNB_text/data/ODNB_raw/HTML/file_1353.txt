<span class="headword">Barclay,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1570, <em>d.</em> in or after 1627), <span class="occ">medical writer and Latin poet</span>, was born at Cullen, Banffshire, one of at least three sons of Walter Barclay (<i>d</i>. 1587), the fiar of Towie, and his wife, Elizabeth, or Elspeth, Hay (<i>fl</i>. 1553&#150;1601). In 1586 William Barclay entered the Catholic college at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, in France, run by his namesake William Barclay (1546&#150;1608) with whom he is sometimes confused. It is possible that he was back in Scotland by 1590, when he was named in legal documents arising from the murder of his father by William Meldrum.<br>
<br>In April 1593 Barclay entered the seminary at Douai, and continued from there to Louvain University, where he studied under Justus Lipsius. Lipsius was said to have considered Barclay among his favourite pupils, and according to the 1670 reprint of <span class="italic">Callirhoe</span>, Lipsius said &#145;that if he were dying he knew no person on earth he would leave his pen to but the doctor&#146;  (Leask, 3.4). Certainly, Barclay provided a Latin &#145;praemetia&#146; to the 1599 Paris edition of Lipsius's Tacitus. By 1598 Barclay had moved to Paris, where he was teaching, and was preparing to return to Scotland as a priest  (<span class="italic">Records of Scots Colleges</span>, 5).<br>
<br>Barclay's career in Scotland is difficult to distinguish owing to the presence of another namesake, an advocate who in time became procurator fiscal of Aberdeen: however, it is clear that it was William Barclay of Towie who was present at a mass being said at the house of William Naper in Edinburgh in March 1601. The house was raided, and Barclay was among those arrested. Barclay, who had previously taken an oath that he was not a Catholic, was declared infamous and sentenced to banishment. In May Patrick Barclay provided bail of 2000 marks to enable his brother to live quietly at home with his mother until the sentence took effect  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 683), and Barclay returned to France, moving to Nantes. It has also been suggested that he raised a family in Sweden during this period as well, but the evidence for this is flimsy  (Barclay, 2.229&#150;30).<br>
<br>It is not clear when Barclay returned again to Scotland, but when he did, he went as a doctor. His best-known publications are English-language tracts on medicine published at Edinburgh. <span class="italic">Nepenthes, or, The Vertues of Tobacco</span> (1614) argues for the health-giving properties of tobacco. It is dedicated to Patrick Barclay, his brother Patrick's son. <span class="italic">Callirhoe, or, The Well of Spa</span> (1615) is a short report on the medical benefits to be gained from bathing in the spring at Aberdeen. In 1618 Barclay wrote a similar pamphlet about the Kingshorn well.<br>
<br>In addition, Barclay composed several pieces of occasional Latin verse, usefully anthologized in <span class="italic">Musa Latina Aberdonensis</span> (1910). A note accompanying one of them, &#145;Apobaterium, or Last Farewell to Aberdeen&#146;, published in Barclay's <span class="italic">Sylvae tres</span> (1619), implies that he was on the point of moving to England, evidence perhaps strengthened by the fact that his next work, <span class="italic">G. Barclayii Judicium</span> (1620)&#151;an attack on the psalm translations of Eglisham&#151;was printed in London. His fellow Catholic Thomas Dempster, writing in 1627, described Barclay as still alive and practising medicine in Scotland, but nothing is known of his career after this date.<br>
