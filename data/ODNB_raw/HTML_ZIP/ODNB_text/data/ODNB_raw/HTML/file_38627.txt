<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Campbell,  Reginald John</span>  (1867&#150;1956), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 29 August 1867 at 2 Norfolk Villas, Jamaica Level, Bermondsey, London, the second of four sons and one daughter of John Campbell, a United Methodist Free Church minister, and his wife, Mary Johnstone. His parents were of Ulster Presbyterian stock. He was registered at birth as John Wesley Campbell, which name also appears on his first marriage certificate, but he matriculated as Reginald John Campbell, the names by which he was commonly known.<br>
<br>Educated privately in Ulster (where he spent some of his childhood), at grammar school, and University College in Nottingham, he matriculated as a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1892 after some years as a schoolteacher. He took a second class in modern history in 1895 and proceeded MA in 1902. He was made an honorary DD in 1919. He married first, in 1889, Mary Elizabeth (1861&#150;1924), daughter of James Slack of Nottingham; and second, in 1927, Ethel Gertrude Smith (1885&#150;1943).<br>
<br>Already confirmed as an Anglican, and moving in Anglo-Catholic circles, it was assumed that Campbell would take holy orders in the Church of England. However, in a period of crisis, he rejected Anglo-Catholic assumptions and unexpectedly, under the influence of A. M. Fairbairn, principal of Mansfield College, became minister of the Congregationalist Union Street Chapel, Brighton. The congregation rallied strongly under his leadership, though it was as much Anglican as nonconformist in composition. It was during these years that he embarked upon a wide range of reading in theology, philosophy, and spirituality. His nonconformity was eclectic. He had a considerable pulpit presence but was not given to histrionics. His delicate features, crowned by an early shock of snow-white hair, expressed spiritual refinement and insight but also revealed physical vulnerability. He was already no stranger to nervous breakdown. Publication of volumes of sermons brought him a wider audience, and prominent Liberal politicians beat a path to his dinner table. His political Liberalism at this time, however, did not altogether banish his early exposure to strong Ulster sentiment. A visit to Cape Town in 1900, for the sake of his health, resulted in his catching both enteric and imperial fever: God had given to the British certain powers which other races had not.<br>
<br>Campbell's reputation spread, and in May 1903 he took up duties as minister of the City Temple&#151;&#145;the cathedral of nonconformity&#146;&#151;in London. On his opening Sunday the total congregations, morning and evening, came to 7000 people. He was expected to preach twice on Sundays and at a popular Thursday lunchtime service. The sermons, which addressed both issues of the day and doctrinal questions, were instantly published and attracted much attention both in Britain and in the United States. Concerning the contemporary educational controversy, Campbell declared that he was unwilling to pay &#145;the parson's rate&#146;. Some of his leading nonconformist colleagues, even so, felt that he was too gentle with the Church of England, although a particular assault which Campbell made on sacerdotalism accorded with Lloyd George's view of sound doctrine. The fact was that Campbell found it difficult to reconcile the conflicting strands in his upbringing and environment. He lived perpetually on edge.<br>
<br>The New Theology controversy which erupted in 1907 accentuated these tensions. Originating in a press interview Campbell gave to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, the term reflected, in his words, an attitude and a spirit rather than a creed. At great speed, Campbell wrote a book, <span class="italic">The New Theology</span> (1907), which produced further controversy and public fame. Groups of disciples sprang to his defence, and organized a national movement to spread his ideas throughout the country. Traditional exposition of the fall or of the blood-atonement, Campbell suggested, was not only misleading but unethical. There is ample testimony to the interest the book aroused. Orthodox theologians, however, suggested that it revealed that Campbell had never been trained in theology. According to the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span>, A. M. Fairbairn described the book as &#145;a farrago of nonsense&#146;  (4 April 1907), and James Denney wrote scornfully in private about &#145;half-educated sophists who write New Theologies&#146;  (Denney, 85). Campbell was apparently even subject to death threats. Undeterred, he took up the &#145;social gospel&#146;, put himself at the disposal of the Independent Labour Party, and produced a volume entitled <span class="italic">Christianity and the Social Order</span> (1907). Campbell was elected to the executive of the Fabian Society in 1908 and shared platforms with Keir Hardie. He supported votes for women and divorce. The conflicting demands on his time and energy, however, created tensions which Campbell found increasingly difficult to handle. Suffering from ill health, he gradually withdrew from public commitments. There were suspicions that he was meditating a return to the Church of England. On his own account, he was influenced by criticism of the New Theology by the Anglican Charles Gore.<br>
<br>Campbell's support for the war in 1914 was politically important. He paid a short visit to the western front. Lloyd George made his first public statement on the war in the City Temple. Campbell's stance upset Liberals and socialists of pacifist inclination. In 1915 he stopped the publication of his book on the New Theology and shortly afterwards resigned from the City Temple. In the same year, he was ordained in the Church of England and joined the staff of Birmingham Cathedral. In 1916 he published an autobiography which conveyed the message that his decision had been logical since he had never been a thoroughbred English nonconformist. It was a blow to dissent to lose a man many regarded as the most dynamic figure in its ranks. Even so, he claimed to be only exchanging a more perfect for a less perfect churchmanship.<br>
<br>Campbell's Anglican career thereafter was far less exposed to public scrutiny. It transpired that as vicar of Christ Church, Westminster, Campbell could not continue in the kind of ministry he had exercised as a nonconformist. Years from 1924 until 1930 back in Brighton at Trinity Chapel were more successful. He was appointed to a residential canonry at Chichester in 1930, a post he held until 1936. For the next decade he remained at Chichester as chancellor, where he reviewed books regularly in the religious press and wrote devotional and biographical studies, an activity continued in retirement after 1946. In 1947, in a private letter, Campbell wrote that no man could have done more to have avoided publicity than he had done for a generation. Before 1914, on the other hand, he had received it, perhaps courted it, in ample measure. He died at his home, Heatherdene, at Fairwarp, near Uckfield, Sussex, on 1 March 1956.<br>
