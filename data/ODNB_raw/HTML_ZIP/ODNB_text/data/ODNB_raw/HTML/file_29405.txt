<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wildman, Sir  John</span>  (1622/3&#150;1693), <span class="occ">Leveller and conspirator</span>, was possibly the son of Jeffrey Wildman, yeoman, of Wreningham, Norfolk. According to Clarendon, Wildman, whom he knew personally, studied at Cambridge, though surviving records do not mention him. He also reputedly pursued legal studies in London, and though he never became a barrister he provided legal assistance to various people and was knowledgeable in property law. Medicine also interested him. Pepys erred in labelling Wildman a Fifth Monarchist, and although Burnet regarded him as a deist in his later life, Wildman welcomed the Independent minister George Cokayne into his home to preach, suggesting that he had congregationalist sympathies. Before 1646 Wildman married Frances, daughter of Sir Francis Englefield, a Catholic baronet in Berkshire; they had one son, John (<i>d</i>. 1710). By 1655, shortly after Frances's death, Wildman had married Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1692), daughter of Lord Lovelace.<h2>
<a name="MilitaryserviceandLevelleractivity"></a>Military service and Leveller activity</h2>By 1647 Wildman was serving in the army, and in July he professed to have inside knowledge about negotiations concerning &#145;The heads of proposals&#146;&#151;the army's terms for a settlement with Charles I. On 4 September the general committee of officers recommended that he be appointed governor of Poole and Brownsea, but nothing came of this, perhaps prompting his decision to leave the army. In late September, Wildman and Maximilian Petty began helping agents who represented five regiments articulate their grievances. The result was <span class="italic">The Case of the Armie Truly Stated</span>, to which Wildman may have contributed. Presented to Sir Thomas Fairfax on 18 October, it accused the generals of not keeping faith with the soldiers by purging parliament and called for a radical extension of the franchise, biennial parliaments, the abolition of tithes and the excise, repeal of recusancy and conventicle statutes, and law reform. Wildman almost certainly helped compose the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, setting forth the Levellers' call for a unicameral legislature, biennial elections, expanded suffrage, and religious freedom. He was a principal spokesman for the agreement in the debates held at Putney in the general council of the army. On the eve of the debates he may have written the first of the <span class="italic">Two Letters from the Agents of the Five Regiments</span>, encouraging soldiers to demand reform; he also probably wrote <span class="italic">A Cal to All the Souldiers of the Army</span>, distributed on 29 October, accusing Cromwell and Henry Ireton of betraying the soldiers' trust. On the contentious issue of suffrage, he argued in the debates that &#145;every person in England hath as cleere a right to Elect his Representative as the greatest person in England&#146;  (Firth, 1.318). He also denied any power in the House of Lords or monarch to veto legislation approved by the Commons, insisting that all authority be vested in the Commons, and called for Charles's trial. Shortly thereafter the general council of the army appointed Wildman (the only citizen to be included) to a committee assigned to examine the extent to which <span class="italic">The Case of the Armie</span> and the agreement were compatible with the army grandees' position. In the meantime Wildman and John Lilburne were organizing a campaign in London against the grandees and parliament. Writing under the anagrammatic pseudonym John Lawmind, in late December Wildman published <span class="italic">Putney Projects</span>, attacking the grandees as pretended patriots and accusing Cromwell of attempting to impose slavery on England. Early the following year Wildman, Lilburne, and others wrote to supporters in Kent urging them to stand firm. At a meeting in Smithfield, Wildman warned that civil war would resume if the government were not quickly settled, and he again assailed Cromwell.<br>
<br>Arrested on charges of sedition, Wildman (alias Wenman) and Lilburne appeared at the bar of the Commons on 20 January 1648, where they denied the house's jurisdiction and demanded trial by common law. The house committed them to prison, where they remained without trial for six months. In <span class="italic">Truths Triumph</span> (1648) he protested his arrest, called for national unity on behalf of freedom and justice, depicted the plight of textile workers in the west, and cited food riots in Wiltshire to exhort parliament to implement reforms. At Lilburne's request Wildman also composed <span class="italic">The Laws Subversion</span> (1648), pleading the case of the presbyterian MP Sir John Maynard, who had also been imprisoned without trial. Following a petition from London supporters and Maynard's address to the Commons, parliament released Wildman and Lilburne on 2 August. At the Nag's Head tavern on 15 November, Wildman explained the &#145;just ends of the war&#146; to Levellers and Independents, following which the group resolved to convene a committee to draft another agreement  (<span class="italic">Writings and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</span>, 1.688&#150;9). In late November, Wildman and Lilburne conferred at Windsor with Colonel Thomas Harrison, and it was agreed to set up a committee comprising radicals from London and parliament as well as from the army and the Leveller leadership to prepare a new <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. In reaction, this helped to precipitate the vote in the House of Commons to accept the king's latest answer to the parliamentary peace proposals as the basis of a settlement, and this in turn precipitated Pride's Purge and the trial of the king. The committee did indeed meet throughout mid-December (the &#145;Whitehall debates&#146;) and drew up a new agreement, but to the disgust of Wildman and other Levellers, when the army presented this document to the Rump of the Long Parliament on 15 January 1649 it had significantly diluted it, above all in weakening the commitment to religious liberty as a natural right. Later allegations that Wildman was on the scaffold with Charles I are baseless, but claims that he differed significantly from other Leveller leaders in his refusal to denounce the king's trial as a sham and in his willingness to work with the new Commonwealth regime are correct.<br>
<br>In May the government was preparing to send Wildman as a commissioner to Guernsey, but for unknown reasons this fell through. The same year he was commissioned as an officer in Sir John Reynolds's regiment of horse, though he did not accompany it to Ireland in August. <span class="italic">The Clarke Papers</span> lists a Captain Wildman as commanding a troop of sixty men in Cheshire, and a Major Wildman in charge of a troop of Reynolds's horse in Hampshire. For Wildman's refusal to condemn the new regime, Lilburne and Richard Overton castigated him in July.<br>
<br>Wildman's estrangement from his fellow Levellers was brief, for in 1650 he and Lilburne advised in the exchequer the fenmen who were protesting the draining of the marshes around the Isle of Axholme, in Lincolnshire. In the autumn Wildman and Lilburne went to Lincolnshire, but they apparently made no attempt to organize support for the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, nor did they participate in or encourage the riots and destruction of crops. In October 1651 Wildman and Lilburne entered into an agreement with the fenmen, promising to defend them from lawsuits and fines stemming from the riots in return for 1000 acres each. While Lilburne was responsible for surveying this land, Wildman defended the commoners' interests in London, but he and Lilburne failed to persuade parliament to hear the fenmen's case. There is no reliable evidence that the fenland involvement of the two men was intended as a precursor of a Leveller inspired insurrection.<br>
<br>In the meantime Wildman and John Price represented London freemen in December 1650 as they endeavoured to make the London Common Hall representative of the citizens rather than the livery companies, but their efforts ultimately failed. Nor was Wildman successful in December 1651 when he sought to represent Gloucester in seeking reparations from parliament for damages sustained in the siege of August 1643; for his services he wanted a third of any reparations, which the mayor and aldermen deemed excessive. During the early 1650s he was active in the land market, purchasing property in twenty counties, mostly as an agent for others. The properties included Becket House, Shrivenham, Berkshire, which he acquired from Henry Marten. Of the fifty transactions in which he participated, most involved property in Lancashire and Yorkshire; through such dealings he obtained substantial wealth.<h2>
<a name="Conspiracyandespionageduringtheprotectorate"></a>Conspiracy and espionage during the protectorate</h2>In the elections to the first protectorate parliament Wildman stood for Westminster and Scarborough, losing the former but winning the latter. However, proprietors of reclaimed land in Lincolnshire successfully petitioned against his sitting on the grounds that he had lied about the contract awarding him 1000 acres for defending the fenmen. Wildman now turned against the government, drafting the petition of three republican colonels&#151;Thomas Saunders, John Okey, and Matthew Allured&#151;against rule by a single person and in favour of the fundamental rights outlined in the agreement. Wildman and other Levellers met with excluded parliamentary republicans, and he was also in contact with Major-General Robert Overton, who was implicated in a plot against Monck in Scotland. With Edward Sexby, Wildman not only sowed discontent among army units but plotted to assassinate Cromwell. He was arrested in the second week of February 1655 as he was dictating &#145;The declaration of the free and well-affected people &hellip; in arms against the tyrant Oliver Cromwell&#146;. In it he called for a constitutional settlement with free and regular parliaments. He was confined in Chepstow Castle and then transferred to the Tower on 10 March. Through his friend Colonel Henry Bishop he made contact with royalists prior to Penruddock's insurrection the same month. Cromwell accused Wildman of being one of the uprising's managers. In fact Wildman was prepared to sell himself to either side, offering his services to John Thurloe as a spy while pursuing contacts with the royalist agents William Rumbold, an incarcerated Leveller, and Sir Robert Shirley. Apparently in return for agreeing to spy on royalists Wildman was released on 26 June 1656 on a bond of &pound;10,000, and his estates were restored.<br>
<br>Acting as a double agent, Wildman, William Howard, and eight other Baptists and Levellers signed a petition to the exiled future Charles II pledging to venture their lives for him if he promised to restore the Long Parliament, abolish tithes, grant amnesty, and provide religious freedom. For their services they unsuccessfully sought &pound;2000 from Charles. In January 1657 Wildman again plotted with Sexby to assassinate Cromwell, to which end they commissioned Miles Sindercombe. Wildman approved a plan to burn Whitehall Palace, killing Cromwell and signalling an uprising. Following the arrest of Sexby in July 1657, perhaps owing to Wildman's betrayal, the latter assumed responsibility for negotiating with the Spaniards as part of the conspiracy; for this purpose he travelled to Flanders several times in the summer and early autumn. He professed to want an invasion of England, but Charles lacked money and men. Negotiations between Levellers and royalists ceased in December 1657 when Howard was arrested.<br>
<br>After Richard Cromwell succeeded his father as protector in September 1658 Wildman sought to forge an alliance between Levellers, Baptists, royalists, and Spaniards; his principal co-conspirators were the duke of Buckingham and Peter Talbot, an Irish Jesuit. Wildman was possibly a co-author in February 1659 of <span class="italic">The Leveller</span>, which echoed James Harrington's call for a government of laws rather than men. When the army ousted Cromwell in May, Wildman gave up on his plot; by this point Hyde had lost confidence in him in any event. With Marten, Henry Nevile, John Lawson, Samuel Moyer, and John Jones, Wildman wrote two letters to the army leader Charles Fleetwood in early May calling for a bicameral legislature, with a senate to debate issues and a popular assembly to enact laws. Two months later he helped Nevile draft a humble petition to the restored Rump Parliament opposing a unicameral legislature. The petition, which had been written in Nonsuch House, represented Harrington's views. With other republicans, Wildman and Nevile founded the Rota Club in Michaelmas term. In recognition of Wildman's keen interest in polity Fleetwood invited him to sit on a committee to draft a new constitution in the wake of the army's recent expulsion of the Rump, and he did so with zeal, though the effort failed. When John Lambert went to Scotland to heal a rift with Monck over the army's actions Wildman threw his support to Lambert's parliamentarian foes, persuading Colonel Henry Ingoldsby and Major Robert Huntington to seize Windsor Castle. For this the Rump, restored once more, thanked Wildman on 28 December, and he was appointed colonel of the Berkshire militia and a commissioner for the assessment at Westminster in January 1660. The same month he received the council of state's thanks for his service in suppressing dangerous meetings in Berkshire.<h2>
<a name="Disaffectionimprisonmentandparliamentaryservice"></a>Disaffection, imprisonment, and parliamentary service</h2>His republican principles notwithstanding, Wildman was initially regarded with favour by the Restoration regime, undoubtedly because of his royalist links in the 1650s. He must have helped himself as well by terminating the Rota Club in February 1660. Drawing on his substantial wealth, he may have assisted Bishop pay &pound;21,000 for the postmaster-generalship, and for a time he exercised considerable influence over Bishop. In the undated &#145;Brief discourse concerning the business of intelligence&#146; he provided the government with suggestions on how to use the Post Office to conduct espionage. Simultaneously, however, he participated in the republican club that gathered in his own Nonsuch House, which William Parker managed for him. For allegedly plotting with Harrington, John Ireton, and others, Wildman was imprisoned in the Tower on 26 November 1661. The government suspected them of conspiring to restore the Long Parliament or electing a new one, seizing London and other key towns, and opposing a standing army, but a parliamentary committee could not find substantial evidence of a conspiracy. Apparently to avoid a writ of habeas corpus he was moved to St Mary's in the Isles of Scilly in July 1662. Accusations that he helped to plot the northern rebellion in 1663 are baseless. Moved to Pendennis Castle in early 1666, he was finally released in October 1667, probably through Buckingham's intervention. The duke made Wildman his secretary and legal adviser. Samuel Pepys heard in December that Wildman had been nominated to the commission to investigate the public accounts, but nothing came of this, probably owing to substantial opposition from Sir William Coventry and Sir John Talbot. Citing ill health, Wildman took his family to the continent in July 1670. Upon his return in 1675 he resumed his close relationship with Buckingham, serving as his solicitor and a trustee of his will. He and Nevile accompanied the duke to Paris in August 1678 in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain money from Louis XIV to support their political activities. Although Wildman's endeavour to win a seat in parliament for Marlborough failed in the first election of 1679, he succeeded in the second election, only to be rejected by the election commission. As MP for Great Bedwin, Wiltshire, in the Oxford parliament he voted against exclusion, preferring to impose limitations on James.<h2>
<a name="TheRyeHouseplotMonmouthsrebellionandexile"></a>The Rye House plot, Monmouth's rebellion, and exile</h2>Frustrated by the king's treatment of parliament Wildman apparently engaged in reckless talk of assassinating Charles, or so the informer Charles Rea claimed in April 1681. Wildman was now working closely with Algernon Sidney and Silius Titus. When Sidney persuaded Monmouth, Essex, and Russell to tell Wildman about their proposed insurrection, the latter repudiated assassination. At their request he drafted a revolutionary manifesto; no copy survives. He played a key role in discussions with Scottish dissidents, especially Robert Baillie, but Robert Ferguson subsequently accused Wildman of failing to persuade the Scots to support a commonwealth. He was also in touch with Robert West's Rye House cabal through Richard Rumbold, but he refused to give Rumbold money to purchase weapons for an assassination party. Following disclosure of the plotting Wildman was incarcerated in the Tower, on 28 June 1683. Before his apprehension he had sent word to his wife to destroy any incriminating papers. In late July the government considered trying him, but it had insufficient evidence, notwithstanding Howard of Escrick's claim that Wildman knew about the proposed uprising. Two cannon and their carriage, which James thought were suitable for use in the streets, were found in the cellar of Wildman's London house, hidden under straw and wood; in October the state investigated their origin (Wildman had obtained them from Buckingham). Appearing in king's bench on a writ of habeas corpus on 28 November, Wildman was released on bail. At his home he celebrated the same day with John Hampden and Francis Charlton. He was formally discharged on 12 February 1684.<br>
<br>By late February 1685, following the accession of James II, Wildman and his cousin William Disney were in contact with Monmouth, urging him to reach an agreement with Argyll regarding an invasion. With the whig Goodwin Wharton, Wildman, seeking funds for Monmouth, searched for treasure in Somerset House and a home in Holborn, purportedly with the aid of an executed felon's spirit. Monmouth asked Wildman to communicate with Macclesfield, Delamere, and Gerard of Brandon about co-ordinating a rebellion in Cheshire with the duke's invasion; at the least, he consulted with Delamere in London. When Monmouth was about to sail he sent Robert Cragg to inform Wildman and to ask that the latter send five or six good horses to the west for the duke's use. Monmouth relied on Wildman, Henry Danvers, and Matthew Meade to lead an uprising in London as soon as government troops left for the west, but this the three men failed to do. Wildman refused to consult with Danvers or make plans until the duke landed, thus betraying the confidence Monmouth had placed in him. By this point Wildman was a wanted man, a warrant for his arrest having been issued on 19 May. Proclamations for his apprehension were published on 4 June and 26 July, but he escaped to the continent. In October he was seen in Cleves, where John Locke joined him the following month. The general pardon issued by the king in March 1686 excluded Wildman, as did James's subsequent pardons. In exile Wildman associated with such fellow dissidents as Francis Goodenough, John Manley, John Matthews, and Sir Robert Peyton. Through Gilbert Burnet he established ties to William, becoming one of his chief propagandists. In the <span class="italic">Memorial from the English Protestants</span> (1688), ostensibly from suffering protestants in England to Willem Bentinck, Wildman called on the prince to protect protestantism and the fundamental rights of Englishmen. To win the support of the English for William, he also wrote <span class="italic">Ten Seasonable Queries</span> (1688). Dissatisfied with William's proposed declaration, he drafted an alternative (now lost), castigating Charles's and James's violations of English law. Although Macclesfield and Mordaunt shared his criticism, Shrewsbury, Burnet, and Henry Sidney did not. However, Wildman and Burnet jointly drafted forty or fifty articles condemning James that were to be distributed in the Netherlands if the invasion succeeded.<h2>
<a name="TheConventionandpoliticalactivitiesintheageofWilliamIII"></a>The Convention and political activities in the age of William III</h2>Wildman's stature as a prominent Williamite led to his appointment in December to the assembly of past members of the Commons' committee of thirteen that invited William to exercise civil government. Before the Convention met Wildman articulated his views in <span class="italic">A Letter to a Friend</span> (1689), arguing that the government had been dissolved and all power vested in the people, and calling for a figurehead monarch devoid of a veto. Elected to the Convention for Great Bedwin, he demanded James's permanent exclusion from the throne, argued that government by a Catholic was inconsistent with England's independence, and averred that making William and Mary sovereigns would prevent anarchy. A member of the rights committee, he proposed that the declaration be sent directly to William, bypassing the Lords. He chaired the committee that investigated Philip Burton and Richard Graham, the crown's solicitors in the Rye House trials. Altogether Wildman was named to sixty-four committees, including those to examine the public accounts, consider the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, prevent excessive expenses in electing MPs, and draft an address supporting William's foreign alliances. He made fifteen recorded speeches, in one of which (on 2 November 1689) he contended that the war against James was to defend England against popery and slavery; France, he thundered, was &#145;the Bottom of all Slavery&#146;  (Grey, 9.391). With the Commons' permission, he testified to the Lords' committee investigating the deaths of Sidney, Essex, and Russell. Perhaps because of his previous ties to the army's rank and file, in early 1689 he received numerous petitions from soldiers in Berkshire protesting their poor condition. He continued to defend his political views in print, publishing <span class="italic">Good Advice before it be Too Late</span> and <span class="italic">A Defence of the Proceedings of the Late Parliament</span> the same year. In addition to serving in the Convention, Wildman was appointed postmaster-general at a salary of &pound;1500 p.a. (1689&#150;91), justice of the peace for Middlesex (1689&#150;93), and commissioner of assessment for Westminster (1689) and Berkshire and Wiltshire (1689&#150;93). A member of the Skinners' Company beginning in 1689, he served as an alderman of London (1690&#150;93), having been nominated by Sir Thomas Pilkington and Sir Patience Ward.<br>
<br>In June 1690 Carmarthen accused Wildman of complicity in Sir James Montgomery's plot to restore James to the Scottish throne, but the evidence was inconclusive. The earl of Monmouth charged Wildman with fabricating letters to discredit the tories, an accusation endorsed by Mary. William finally dismissed him as postmaster-general in February 1691, provoking Hampden's ire. The king sought to mend political fences by appointing Wildman deputy lieutenant of Middlesex in March 1692 and knighting him in the Guildhall on 29 October of the same year. Following Wildman's death on 4 June 1693, aged seventy, he was buried in St Andrew's, Shrivenham, Berkshire.<h2>
<a name="Historicalassessment"></a>Historical assessment</h2>Interpretations of Wildman have ranged widely, from Buckingham's reputed claim that he was one of England's wisest statesmen to Sir William Coventry's damning indictment that he had been false to everyone. According to Cragg, Monmouth complained that Wildman had insisted on governing everyone and blamed him for the lack of sufficient support in England in 1685. Disraeli, on the other hand, absurdly praised Wildman as &#145;the soul of English politics in the most eventful period of this kingdom&#146; and a man who &#145;seemed more than once to hold the balance which was to decide the permanent forms of our government&#146;  (B. Disraeli, <span class="italic">Sybil, or, The Two Nations</span>, 1881, 18). As a political thinker and a legal practitioner Wildman was second rate, though his vision of law reform, including codification of common law, limitations on the power of judges, simplification of property law, and a substantial reduction in the use of capital punishment, was bold. Nevertheless, claiming to champion the rights of Englishmen, he seized every opportunity to profit from the misfortunes of others. His irresistible attraction to political intrigue, which proved to be his defining characteristic, overrode both political convictions and friendships.<br>
