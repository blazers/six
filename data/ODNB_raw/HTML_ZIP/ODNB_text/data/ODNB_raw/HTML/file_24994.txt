<span class="headword">Seaward,  John</span>  (1786&#150;1858), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Lambeth, London, in January 1786, the son of a builder. After studying classics and mathematics with equal proficiency, he began working with his father as a surveyor and architect. He was afterwards engaged by Grillier &amp; Co. to supervise the erection of Vauxhall Bridge, one of the first to be built with cement.<br>
<br>This position brought Seaward the acquaintance of Jeremy Bentham and the engineers Ralph and James Walker. He then managed some lead-mines in Wales, acquired a knowledge of chemistry, and became friendly with Arthur Woolf, Richard Trevithick, and other mechanical engineers. On his return to London he superintended the construction of Gordon's, Dowson's, and other docks on the Thames, and became agent for the Gospel Oak ironworks in Staffordshire. He was also connected with the Imperial and Continental Gas Company, which introduced gas lighting into several towns in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In 1823 he made drawings for a new London Bridge and published a treatise on suspension bridges, which gained the attention of Sir Humphrey Davy and other scientists. In 1824 he established the Canal ironworks, Millwall, Poplar, for the construction of machinery. He joined the Institution of Civil Engineers as a member in 1826, and frequently attended its meetings.<br>
<br>A younger brother, <a name="cosubject_24994"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Seaward</span>  (1800&#150;1842)<span class="occ"></span>, joined John in 1825. He had sailed to Bombay and China in the service of the East India Company, and completed an apprenticeship with the Maudslay ironworks in London. He published a <span class="italic">Description of an improved gauge for ascertaining the pressure of highly compressed steam, gases, and fluid bodies</span> (1824), and was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 10 June 1841. He also joined the Institution of Civil Engineers, serving as member of council.<br>
<br>In 1825 the Seawards patented a mechanism for propelling steam carriages on common roads, but thereafter concentrated on marine engines. They produced machinery for every part of the world, and made the name of Seaward widely known. Their first vessel, the <i>Royal George</i>, was intended to run between Dover and Calais. In 1829 they helped to form the Diamond Steam Packet Company, and built the engines for the boats which ran between Gravesend and London. Of these, the Ruby and the Sapphire were types for speed and for accommodation.<br>
<br>In 1836 the Seaward brothers brought out the direct-acting engines for the <i>Gorgon</i> and <i>Cyclops</i>, known as Seaward's engines, nearly dispensing with the heavy side-beam engines which up to that period were in general use. Their success was complete, and the saving obtained in the consumption of fuel by the double-slide valve, for both the steam and the exhaust, with other improvements, caused the government to entrust the Seawards with the building of twenty-four steamboats and some smaller vessels. They also adapted their engines to the vessels of the East India Company, the steam navigation companies, and the ships of foreign governments. They early advocated the use of auxiliary steam power for East India sailing vessels, and experimented with the <i>Vernon</i> in 1839 and 1840 with great success. They also designed large swing-bridges, dredging machines, cranes, and other dock apparatus, besides machinery for lead, saw, and sugar mills. Among the improvements and inventions for which the Seawards were personally responsible were the tubular boilers, which became standard in the Royal Navy, the detachable cranks for paddle-wheel engines, the telescopic funnel, the self-acting nozzles for feeding and for regulating the saturation of the water in marine boilers, the double passages in cylinders for both steam and eduction, and the cheese-couplings used to connect and disconnect the screw propeller to and from the engines.<br>
<br>John Seaward published treatises on bridge construction and high-pressure steam engines, and with Samuel wrote <span class="italic">Observations on the advantages and possibility of successfully employing steam power in navigating ships between this country and the East Indies</span> (1829). For <span class="italic">The Steam Engine</span>, published by Thomas Tredgold in 1850, he contributed articles on &#145;Steam navigation&#146;, &#145;Vessels of iron and wood&#146;, &#145;The steam engine&#146;, and &#145;Screw propulsion&#146;.<br>
<br>The death of Samuel Seaward at 13 Endsleigh Street, London, on 11 May 1842 threw upon John Seaward the entire management of the Canal ironworks, yet with the assistance of his former apprentices he persevered. Among his most perfect works were the engines of the <i>Amazon</i>, 800 horsepower, which he believed would be a lasting monument to his fame. The vessel unfortunately was destroyed by fire on her first passage to the West Indies on 4 January 1852. After an extended illness, John Seaward died of bronchitis at his home, 20 Brecknock Crescent, Camden Town, London, on 26 March 1858. He was survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Seaward.<br>
