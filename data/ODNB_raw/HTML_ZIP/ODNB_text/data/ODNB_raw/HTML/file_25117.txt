<span class="headword">Seton,  Charles</span>, second earl of Dunfermline  (1615&#150;1672), <span class="occ">politician and army officer</span>, was born in Scotland towards the end of 1615 (probably late in November), the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25113/', "Alexander Seton, first earl of Dunfermline (1556&#150;1622)")</script>, and his third wife, Margaret Hay (1592&#150;1659), the sister of John Hay, first earl of Tweeddale. He succeeded his father on 16 June 1622. In 1633 his mother contracted herself in marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16808/', "James Livingston, first earl of Callendar")</script>. Dunfermline was incorporated in St Salvator's College, St Andrews, in 1629. He married Lady Mary Douglas (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1659), the third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7933/', "William Douglas, seventh earl of Morton")</script>, and his wife, Anne Keith, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15263/', "George Keith, Earl Marischal")</script>. Contracts for the marriage were dated 29 March, 2 April, and 9 November 1632.<br>
<br>Dunfermline was a gentleman of the bedchamber of Charles I. He became an active supporter of the covenant, though he has been seen as one who from the beginning sought common ground with the king  (C. Russell, <span class="italic">The Fall of the British Monarchies, 1637&#150;1642</span>, 1991, 522). In May 1639 he led an infantry regiment in Fife in the army of Montrose which occupied the royalist burgh of Aberdeen. In June 1639 he was one of the leaders of the Scottish covenanting army which took up a position on Duns Law to bar the progress of Charles northwards, and on 6 June he presented a petition to the king in his camp that he would appoint commissioners to treat in regard of the matters in dispute. He was one of those who signed the articles of pacification, as well as a paper of submission to the king. In November he and John Campbell, earl of Loudoun, were sent to London to report to the king the proceedings of the assembly of the kirk and the parliament for ratification; but the king refused to receive them and forbade them to approach within 8 miles of the court. Dunfermline was also again sent to the king early in 1640, and on account of the discovery of the letter of the Scots to the king of France, was, with Loudoun and the other commissioners, detained for a time in custody.<br>
<br>Dunfermline was colonel of a regiment raised in western Fife in the Scottish army which, under Alexander Leslie, crossed the Tweed in August 1640. Following the covenanter victory at Newburn and the capture of Newcastle, the earl was appointed Scottish governor of Durham. In October he was appointed one of the eight Scottish commissioners for the treaty of Ripon, and he was also one of the subcommittee appointed for the final conclusion of the treaty in London. While in London he received from the king a lease of the abbey of Dunfermline for fifty-seven years. In August 1641 the estates appointed him a commissioner to the English parliament during the king's trip north. In September he was nominated a member of the Scottish privy council, an appointment confirmed in November. In 1642, as a man who had been partly won over by the royal concessions of 1641, Dunfermline was appointed the king's commissioner to the general assembly of the kirk of Scotland, which met on 27 July. As the English parliament and king presented the general assembly with their rival declarations, Dunfermline conveyed the king's good intentions while urging it not to reply to parliament without royal permission, but &#145;his weeping could not obtain it&#146;  (D. Stevenson, <span class="italic">The Scottish Revolution, 1637&#150;1644: the Triumph of the Covenanters</span>, 1973, 250). Afterwards Dunfermline went to England, presumably on state business; he returned to Scotland in mid-September.<br>
<br>On 26 August 1643 the convention of estates nominated Dunfermline a colonel of Fife foot for the army being prepared to assist the English parliamentarians. The earl chose mercenaries as lieutenant-colonel and major. The regiment was raised from the presbyteries of Kirkcaldy and Dunfermline. Between January and July 1644 it served in the north-east of England, at the siege of York and at the battle of Marston Moor. In August it joined the forces besieging Newcastle. Dunfermline led his men in storming the town in October. Afterwards the regiment was divided, part remaining in England serving in garrisons and at the siege of Newark, while the remainder returned to Scotland to help suppress the royalists.<br>
<br>In January 1646 Dunfermline was chosen as a member of the committee of estates. The estates named him to the committee with the army in England on 3 February; the earl attended it periodically from July to November. After the surrender of Charles to the Scots at Newark in May, he was sent, along with Argyll and others, to treat with him, and accompanied Argyll to London to lay the king's case before parliament. Simultaneously his loyalty to the king's opponents became suspect. In August suspicions connected him with the French ambassador in a plot on the king's behalf. In January 1647 fears about him deepened, and Leven, the lord general, forbade Dunfermline and one other colonel access to the king.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1648 the estates named Dunfermline a colonel of horse in the engager army. Having supported the engagement for the attempted rescue of the king in 1648, he was debarred by the <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span> from holding any office of public trust. He went to the continent in April 1649 and took part in the negotiations at Breda in connection with the recall of Charles II, whom he accompanied to Scotland in June 1650. In July he entertained the king at Dunfermline. When in October the king left Perth and joined the northern loyalists, Dunfermline was one of the commissioners sent to arrange matters with him. On 29 October he was on petition freed from the disabilities imposed on him by the <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span>, and permitted to take his seat in parliament, following public repentance in late November. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the committee of estates for managing the affairs of the army, and he was in frequent attendance on the king during his stay in Scotland. In the army raised for the invasion of England his regiment (raised after 9 January 1651, mainly from the presbytery of Dunfermline) formed part of the 2nd brigade of horse. The regiment subsequently served in the Worcester campaign.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Dunfermline was reinstated as a privy councillor on 13 February 1661 and sworn in on 22 September 1664. On 2 November 1667 he was appointed an extraordinary lord of session. He regularly attended the parliaments of the 1660s and served as a lord of the articles in 1669. In 1671 he was appointed lord privy seal. He died on or about 11 May 1672 at his home, Seton House, and was buried at Dalgety. He and his wife had had one daughter and three sons. The eldest son, Charles, was killed in a sea-fight with the Dutch shortly before his father's death; Alexander, the third earl, died in 1677; and James, the fourth and last earl, in 1689 commanded a troop of horse under Dundee at Killiecrankie, and, being forfaulted, went to France, where he died childless in 1699.<br>
