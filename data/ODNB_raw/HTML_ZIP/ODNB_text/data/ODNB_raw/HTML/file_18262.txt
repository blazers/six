<span class="headword">Masham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Cudworth]</span>,  Damaris</span>, Lady Masham  (1658&#150;1708), <span class="occ">philosopher and theological writer</span>, was born in Cambridge on 18 January 1658. Her father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6864/', "Ralph Cudworth (1617&#150;1688)")</script>, the philosopher and a leading member of the Cambridge Platonists. In 1645 he became regius professor of Hebrew, a post which he held until his death. Her mother, Damaris (<i>d</i>. 1695), possibly the daughter of Mathew Cradock, a London merchant, had been married to Thomas Andrewes of London before her marriage to Cudworth. The younger Damaris was Cudworth's only daughter, but she had a stepsister, a stepbrother, and at least three brothers. <br>
<br>Cudworth, whom his daughter was to defend against critics including Leibniz, was an &#145;unusually open-minded controversialist&#146; and Damaris was brought up in a rare atmosphere of free enquiry and intellectual independence  (Wallas, 75). From a young age she was distinguished by her learning and the keen mind she brought to all her studies. When on 25 June 1685 she married Sir Francis Masham (<i>c</i>.1646&#150;1723), son of William Masham and his wife, Elizabeth Trevor, she acquired nine stepchildren. In 1686 her only son, Francis Cudworth Masham, was born. He was to become accountant-general to the court of chancery. Sir Francis later served as MP for Essex. <br>
<br>Damaris Masham first met John Locke in 1682 when she was twenty-three. They became close friends. In her Locke found &#145;a soul not of ordinary alloy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Rand, 14). He taught Damaris philosophy and divinity. At Otes in Essex, where she and Sir Francis lived, Damaris obviously found life frustrating, as in 1687 she wrote to Locke complaining that he &#145;might advise me to converse with the dead since here [at Otes] are so few living that are worth it&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1690&#150;1715</span>). After returning from exile in Holland in 1688 Locke became increasingly ill in London and in 1691, aged fifty-nine, he was persuaded to leave the city for his health's sake. Already a frequent and welcome visitor at the home of Sir Francis and Lady Masham, Locke was invited to live with them. This he did for thirteen years until his death in 1704. His influence on Damaris, both as a writer and as a mother, was profound. Without Locke's influence she would almost certainly have been ignored, despite the fact that she was a most remarkable and learned woman. Early on in his time at Otes, Locke, in a letter to Limborch of 1690&#150;91, acknowledged her rare qualities:<blockquote>The lady is so well versed in theological and philosophical studies, and of such an original mind, that you will not find many men to whom she is not superior in wealth of knowledge and ability to profit by it. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>Locke's <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</span> was to be Masham's guide in her son's upbringing. According to Locke she taught her son Latin &#145;without knowing it herself when she began&#146;  (Wallas, 86). Despite some natural reluctance she followed Locke's guidance on the importance of sun and fresh air for children to the extent of providing her son with thin-soled shoes. This was at a time when children were carefully shielded from the elements. After Locke's death Damaris wrote that:<blockquote>my first acquaintance with him began when he was past the middle age of man and I but young &hellip; I had for a great part of above two years conversed freely with him, and he favoured me sometimes with his correspondence in Holland. (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, ed. Rand, 13)</blockquote>Life at Otes provided a stimulating and sympathetic atmosphere in which to live and write and Locke benefited greatly from it, although his health did not improve. He continued to supervise Lady Masham's studies as well as the education of her son. He made time for a close friendship with Esther Masham, the stepdaughter of Damaris, and acted as medical adviser to old Mrs Cudworth, who since her husband's death had made her home at Otes. Edward Clarke, husband of Locke's cousin, was a frequent visitor with his children, Edward, on whom Locke tried out his theories of education, and Elizabeth. <br>
<br>Against those who thought this life was merely a preparation for the next, Damaris Masham defended a life of reason&#151;this was particularly bold as most people thought women had no business being reasonable. Her first published work was <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Love of God</span> (1696), an essay on morality. Although published anonymously it was widely known to be hers. It was an answer to the works of John Norris. Norris, who had known Damaris Masham for some time and had been impressed by her piety and learning, dedicated his <span class="italic">Reflections upon the Conduct of Human Life</span> (1690) to his friend under the mistaken notion that she had gone blind. Her friends promptly informed him that he was wrong and that Damaris had not lost her sight, but this did not persuade Norris to withdraw his book. As she commented in <span class="italic">A Discourse</span>, Norris, &#145;having fitted his Epistle to that supposition, could not be hindered from publishing it&#146;  (Masham, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, preface). It was an incident that finally severed Masham's friendship with Norris. In <span class="italic">A Discourse</span> Damaris Masham responded to volume 3 of Norris's <span class="italic">Practical discourses upon several divine subjects</span> (1693). She characterized Norris's position as being that &#145;God's creatures have no warrant for our love, having as they do &#147;no Efficiency at all to operate upon us&#148;; they are simply the &#147;occasional Causes of those Sentiments which God produces in us&#148;&#146;  (Pyle, 560). Her object was to refute Norris's understanding of divine love as &#145;morally subversive and a dangerous imposture as a principle of Christianity&#146;  (ibid.). Her most profound concern was that Norris's account:<blockquote>provides no foundation for virtuous conduct. Additionally, it may cause positive harm by encouraging people to strive for a love of God which they cannot possible attain &#145;and opposite to their very Constitution and Being in this world&#146;, while failing to recognize that their ideal indeed &#145;Destroys all the Duties and Obligations of Social Life&#146;. (ibid.)</blockquote>Damaris Masham's second work, <span class="italic">Occasional thoughts in reference to a vertuous or Christian life</span> (1705), argues against social prejudice for the rational life, and &#145;that the Pursuit of virtue must be based upon a rational commitment to sound religious principles acquired through education&#146;  (Pyle, 560&#150;61). She saw such prejudice as responsible for the ignorance of daughters of the middle and upper classes. &#145;Girls&#146;, she wrote, &#145;betwixt silly Fathers and ignorant Mothers, are generally so brought up that traditionary Opinions are to them, all their lives long, instead of Reason&#146;  (Masham, <span class="italic">Occasional Thoughts</span>, 162). Parents, she saw, were afraid of the consequences of learning in their daughters. &#145;They might be in danger of not finding Husbands&#146;  (ibid., 197). She shared Locke's conviction that mothers should be able to educate their children&#151;boys as well as girls. Men would not welcome learning in their wives but &#145;if Men did usually find Women the more amiable for being knowing, they would much more commonly, than now they are, be so&#146;  (ibid., 204). Unhappy marriages were common and education in women could counter discontent. It was not advice easily followed. A woman must &#145;order the Course and Manner of her Life somewhat differently from others of her Sex and Condition&#146;  (ibid., 198). From her own experience as a learned woman she knew the difficulties and the opposition to be met. <br>
<br>Damaris Masham died at Otes on 20 April 1708 and was buried in the middle aisle of Bath Abbey. Over her grave it was written of &#145;her Learning, Judgement, Sagacity, and Penetration together with her Candor and Love of Truth&#146;  (Ballard, 337).<br>
