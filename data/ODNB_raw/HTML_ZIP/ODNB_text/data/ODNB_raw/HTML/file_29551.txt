<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williams family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1800&#150;<em>c.</em>1875), <span class="occ">engravers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_29546"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Williams</span>  (1788&#150;1853)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 23 February 1788, at Colchester, Essex, the son of John Williams and his wife, Elizabeth. Two of his siblings, <a href="#cosubject_29551">Thomas</a> and <a href="#cosubject_72920">Mary Ann [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were also wood-engravers, and as a family they played an exceptionally conspicuous and influential part in the illustration of books. Little is known of Samuel Williams's parents, except that they were not well off. This meant that although he wanted to become a painter, his father apprenticed him in 1802 to J. Marsden, a printer in Colchester, thinking this a less precarious career. In the printer's studio he taught himself to etch and engrave on copper, and one of his early etchings was used as a frontispiece to a farce called <span class="italic">The Coggeshall Volunteer Corps</span>. Additionally, he learned to draw and engrave on wood. His master must have been impressed for later he commissioned a wood-engraved frontispiece from Williams for a <span class="italic">History of Colchester</span> (possibly that by Thomas Cromwell, in 1825).<br>
<br>Williams started as an engraver on his own account first in Colchester, then in London. An early commission in 1810 came from the London-based publisher Benjamin Crosby for wood-engravings for a natural history book. (Later, in 1823&#150;4, he produced plates for Mrs Mary Trimmer's <span class="italic">Natural History</span>.) Quite often he was employed both to design and engrave book illustrations, and some proved highly popular, including those in editions of <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> (1822), Lady Charlotte Guest's <span class="italic">Mabinogion</span> (1838), James Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span> (1841), and Thomas Miller's <span class="italic">Pictures of Country Life</span> (1847). On other occasions, Williams simply engraved the designs of other artists, for instance, in J. H. Wiffen's edition of Tasso's <span class="italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span> (1824), J. G. Lockhart's <span class="italic">Spanish Ballads</span> (1840), the Abbotsford edition of the <span class="roman">Waverley novels</span> (1842), F. T. Kugler's <span class="italic">Handbook of Painting</span> (1849), and in H. H. Milman's <span class="italic">Horace</span> (1849). Of the engravings he produced for William Scrope's <span class="italic">The Art of Deer-Stalking</span> (1846), the author spoke highly in the preface of the third edition.<br>
<br>Williams also played a leading role in the embellishment of illustrated periodicals. He worked for William Hone, producing engravings for his <span class="italic">Every-Day Book</span> (1825&#150;7), and even more extensively for two other periodicals: a weekly, <span class="italic">The Olio, or, Museum of Entertainment</span> (1828&#150;33), and a monthly, <span class="italic">The Parterre of Fiction, Poetry, History, Literature, and the Fine Arts</span> (1834&#150;5). His name appeared on the title-page of the latter, while in prefaces to both the editors specifically mentioned the value of Williams's contribution. In all his work, Williams enjoyed playing up tonal contrasts, on which W. J. Linton thought him too dependent, so that his line work suffered, and became weak. One of his pupils, John Orrin Smith, was well known for the tone and refinement that he achieved in his engravings of landscapes. Another of his pupils was George Baxter.<br>
<br>In his spare time Williams painted miniatures on ivory and full-scale oil paintings. He became known as a painter of rural life scenes, exhibiting, for instance, <span class="italic">Sketching a Countryman</span> at the Royal Academy in 1831 (from 2 Hadlow Street) and several paintings at the British Institution, including <span class="italic">Don Quixote Giving Advice to Sancho</span> in 1825 (from Harrison Street, Gray's Inn Road); and <span class="italic">Sancho Requesting the Duchess to Superscribe his Letter</span> in 1834 (from 5 Mabledon Place, Burton Crescent). He died on 19 September 1853 at 20 Gloucester Street, Gloucester Gate, Regent's Park, after a long and painful illness, his wife having died some six weeks earlier. Samuel appears to have been a good-humoured person, Lewer recording that he enjoyed flying a kite  (Lewer, 172&#150;3). He signed his engravings &#145;S. WILLIAMS&#146; or &#145;S. W.&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_29551"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Williams</span>  (<em>b. </em>1798)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 26 November 1798, also at Colchester. He was taught to engrave by his elder brother, and became a competent copyist, although not an original designer. Good examples of his work are found in James Northcote's <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1828 and 1833), John Martin and Richard Westall's <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Bible</span> (1833), and Edward Moxon's edition of <span class="roman">Tennyson's poems</span> (1857). Thomas undertook much work for the printer Charles Whittingham senior, producing engravings, for example, for his <span class="roman">Pocket Novel</span> series (39 vols.) and <span class="italic">Peter Parley's Tales about Christmas</span> (1838). He also painted Whittingham's portrait and designed an emblem for the Chiswick Press. According to Whittingham's biographer, Thomas used to laugh at his own jokes and, more endearingly, blow through the stem of his pipe until the bowl smoked like a chimney  (Warren, 73). The publisher Charles Knight also benefited from Thomas's assistance. Many of the engraver's woodcuts appeared in, for instance, Charles Knight's <span class="roman">Land We Live In</span> series, Knight's <span class="italic">Penny Magazine</span> (July 1842 issue), and Knight's edition of E. W. Lane's <span class="italic">Arabian Nights' Entertainment</span> (1839). Thomas worked on this latter project with his brother and sister, while he and several family members collaborated in producing engravings after William Harvey's drawings for <span class="italic">Solace of Song</span> (1836). His engravings were signed &#145;THOS WILLIAMS sc&#146;, &#145;T WILLIAMS&#146;, &#145;T W&#146;, or &#145;TW&#146;. He trained Joseph Swain in 1837. Two addresses are known for him: 15 Wine Office Court, Fleet Street (1855) and 37 Ludgate Hill (1862). Thomas Williams never married and was always in a poor state both physically and financially.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72920"></a><span class="headword">Mary Ann Williams</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1788) was a <span class="occ">genre painter and illustrator</span> as well as an engraver. She worked with her brothers on numerous commissions, while independently she engraved plates for several books, including Leigh Hunt's <span class="italic">The Palfry</span> (1842) and S. C. Hall's <span class="italic">Ireland</span> (1841). Most notably she produced woodcuts for Sir Henry Cole's (pseudonym Felix Summerly) guidebooks to Hampton Court (1841) and Westminster Abbey (1842), which, employing only female wood-engravers, did much to promote their cause. She signed her engravings &#145;M. A. WILLIAMS, sc&#146;, &#145;MARY ANN WILLIAMS SC&#146;.<br>
<br>In the next generation Samuel Williams's four sons and a daughter&#151;<a name="cosubject_72923"></a><span class="headword">John Manning Williams</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1832)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_72927"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Lionel Williams</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1832, <em>d.</em> 1877), <span class="occ">painter and engraver</span>, <a name="cosubject_72928"></a><span class="headword">Alfred Mayhew Williams</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1832)<span class="occ"></span>, <a name="cosubject_72929"></a><span class="headword">Frederick George Williams</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1832)<span class="occ"></span>, and <a name="cosubject_72931"></a><span class="headword">Emma Williams</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1832)<span class="occ"></span>&#151;were all baptized at the Old Church, St Pancras, London, on 2 October 1832, when their mother's name was recorded as Emma (Amy). All practised wood-engraving at some time. Quite often they collaborated with their father, for instance, Joseph helped his father on the Revd Thomas Scott's <span class="italic">Bible</span> (1833&#150;4) and <span class="italic">The Solace of Song</span> (1836), while both he and his sister assisted with S. C. Hall's <span class="italic">Book of British Ballads</span> (1842). Both Joseph and Alfred produced woodcuts for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. Among Joseph's most prominent efforts for this periodical were his drawing and engraving of the Christmas illustration <span class="italic">Bring in the Boar's Head, Queen's College, Oxford</span> (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 26 December 1846), and a double-page spread, <span class="italic">Funeral of the Late Duke of Wellington</span> (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 11 December 1852), while one of Alfred's was an engraving after J. Murray's <span class="italic">The Minton Testimonial Museum</span> (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 11 February 1860). For the same journal, Alfred seems also to have worked with his brother John as John and Alfred Williams (who between 1853 and 1858 signed their plates &#145;J. &amp; A. W.&#146; or &#145;J. &amp; A. Williams&#146;), producing numerous plates, including <span class="italic">The Sultan's New Palace of Dolmabaghdsche</span> for the issue of 22 October 1853. They worked from 6 Palsgrave Place, Strand, while other addresses are known for Alfred alone: 5 Gloucester Place, Regent's Park (1855), and 50 Carey Street, London (1872&#150;5). Joseph Lionel exhibited historical and genre paintings at the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists between 1834 and 1874; he died in London in 1877. Examples of the Williams family's engravings are in the British Museum.<br>
