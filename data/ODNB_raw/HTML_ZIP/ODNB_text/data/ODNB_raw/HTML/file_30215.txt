<span class="headword">Yelverton, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1477?), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of John Yelverton of Rackheath, Norfolk, recorder of Norwich, and his second wife. She was Elizabeth, the daughter and heir of John Read of Rougham, and by 1410 was married to her second husband, Richard Clere of Stokesby. Although he was the heir to the Read property in Rougham and Bayfield, William followed his father into the legal profession. He entered Gray's Inn and appears in Segar's list of readers. By 1427 he was a JP for Norwich, and from 1433 to 1450 recorder of the city, although, curiously, he sat in the parliaments of 1435 and 1443 for Great Yarmouth. Other Norfolk employers included the duke of Norfolk. Yelverton was called to the coif in 1438, appointed to the western assize circuit in 1439, retained by the duchy of Lancaster from 1440, and by Michaelmas 1442 was a king's serjeant. On 1 July 1443 he was promoted to the court of king's bench. As a crown lawyer he was summoned to the Lords for the parliaments of 1445, and thereafter regularly until 1470&#150;71. In May 1461 Yelverton, by then the senior puisne, had hopes of succeeding the disgraced Sir John Fortescue as chief justice, but John Markham was appointed; however, Markham used his influence to secure for Yelverton a compensating knighthood. Yelverton continued in post until 6 April 1471 when Edward IV, returning after the readeption of Henry VI, chose not to reappoint him.<br>
<br>Yelverton's deep involvement in East Anglian politics did not always sit easily with the substantial use the crown made of him for judicial and administrative commissions. In 1454 he even found his clerk being arrested in Westminster Hall. The judge is, however, best known for his involvement in the dispute over Sir John Fastolf's will, the central preoccupation of the Paston letters. Sir William had initially been a colleague and friend of John (I) Paston, both on the duke of Norfolk's council and as an adviser, feoffee, and executor to Sir John Fastolf. The two fell out when a will made by the dying Fastolf hugely benefited Paston, and cut out Yelverton and other former trustees and executors. William Yelverton suspected foul play&#151;he had not, unlike Paston, reached Sir John's bedside&#151;and he challenged the will in the Canterbury court of audience. Although in 1467 probate was awarded to the Pastons, litigation in chancery (which again Yelverton lost) only reached judgment in 1470&#150;71. Thereafter the families were quickly reconciled, and in 1472 began negotiating a marriage between Yelverton's grandson and John Paston's younger daughter.<br>
<br>What Yelverton's motives were in the Fastolf affair is not obvious. William Worcester, an erstwhile ally, described him as &#145;the cursed Norfolk justice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Itineraries</span>, 190&#150;91). He certainly had his fair share of acquisitiveness, and if he had been offered &#145;a frendelyhood&#146; by Paston he might initially have compromised. However, it is also very probable that he felt morally obliged to protest against the subversion of Fastolf's wishes and the placing in jeopardy of the health of Sir John's soul. Sir William's genuine religious sympathy is seen elsewhere. He was especially devoted to the Virgin Mary, shown by his promoting the interests of Walsingham Priory, and he was buried before her image in the chancel of Rougham church. He was also a member of the Guild of St George in Norwich, and was promised an individual mention among the obits in recognition of his role in arbitrating between the guild and the Norwich city authorities. &#145;Yelverton's mediation&#146; ended fifty years of dispute, by effectively integrating the Guild of St George and a second prominent guild, the Batchery, with the city oligarchy.<br>
<br>The inscription on Sir William's monumental brass is lost, but is known to have given the day and month of death as 27 March. He appears to have still been alive in November 1476 but was omitted from the Norfolk commission of the peace of 4 May 1478, which makes 1477 the most likely year of death. He bequeathed a significant East Anglian estate to John Yelverton, the son and heir of Sir William's first marriage (before 1421), to Joan, the daughter of Oliver Grose of Sloley. He apparently married twice more, first to Ela, daughter of Sir Robert Brews and thus aunt to Margery Paston, and then to Agnes Campe of Brentwood, Essex, the widow of John Rands of Barking. Agnes survived him and died in 1489. The figures of William and Agnes survive from the monumental brass in Rougham church, and depict the judge in judicial robes and a serjeant's coif, worn incongruously over full armour.<br>
