<span class="headword">Henry fitz Ailwin</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1212), <span class="occ">first mayor of London</span>, was of English descent, as may be seen in the names of his father Ailwin, or &AElig;thelwine, and grandfather Leofstan. The latter, who was later believed to have been the reeve of London associated with the royal foundation (1108) of Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate, may have been the domesman who died in 1115 and was buried in Bermondsey Priory. It was in the house of Ailwin son of Leofstan that the London husting court was meeting before 1130, the year in which Robert son of Leofstan accounted for the London weavers' guild. Henry fitz Ailwin and his brother Alan succeeded to their father's land, probably at Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire, in 1164/5. Like many wealthy citizens Henry had estates strategically situated around London. His chief country seat was at Watton, and his land at Edmonton, Middlesex, probably served as a staging post. He also had lands in Surrey and by the Thames in Kent. His headquarters in the city occupied a large site on the north side of Candlewick (now Cannon) Street, adjoining the church of St Swithin, whose patron he was, and extended into the parish of St Mary Bothaw. Apart from his dwelling it included a horse mill and tenters for stretching cloth. He also held many properties in the eastern half of the city, including a quay next to London Bridge. The distribution of his holdings suggests that as well as drawing rent he was active in trade, including the distribution of rural produce. Candlewick Street was the focus of London's woollen textile industry, and there were many dubbers (in this context possibly dyers) among his neighbours. That circumstance, together with his tenters and his presumed uncle's association with weavers, suggests that he and his family had a direct interest in making, finishing, and selling cloth.<br>
<br>Henry fitz Ailwin was an alderman of London by 1168, and from then on appears frequently as a witness with other chief citizens. His equestrian seal, resembling that of the influential William Bucuinte, is expressive of claims to status and ancestry. He had a close connection with the sheriff Richard fitz Reiner, a key figure in the emergence of the commune in the early 1190s. Henry's appearance at the head of a group of four men of rank&#151;<i>nobiles</i> of the city&#151;who included Richard, indicates his role as civic leader. He is first certainly identified as mayor in 1194. Initially that position may have been informal, for even after that year he sometimes witnessed in an official capacity without being styled mayor. But no other person is named as holding the mayoralty during his life time, and there can be no doubt that Henry held it until his death. No other mayor of London has held office on a life term. As mayor Henry fitz Ailwin embodied the interests of the leading citizens, sometimes in opposition to the majority&#151;who found a vociferous spokesman in William fitz Osbert (<i>d</i>. 1196)&#151;but he was also the king's man, as is evident from his frequent association with the justice Roger fitz Reinfrey. Throughout his mayoralty he was regularly accompanied by Roger fitz Alan, his successor as mayor and probably his nephew. On a few occasions about 1205 he was designated <i>dominus</i>, a style not generally accorded to mayors of London until a later date.<br>
<br>Henry fitz Ailwin's recorded actions illuminate his public role rather than his personal character. In 1193 he was one of those entrusted with the money collected for the king's ransom, and in 1194 he arrested a foolish messenger from the king's brother. In 1208 he negotiated for the use of ground outside the walls as a burial-ground for Londoners during the interdict. After the great fire of 1212 he and other barons of London issued a code governing rebuilding. He was a pious benefactor to the church and, probably after 1199, endowed obits at Holy Trinity Priory, St Bartholomew's Hospital, Westminster Abbey, London Bridge Chapel, and the nunneries of Clerkenwell and Godstow. He also contributed to the foundation of St Mary Spital, and was remembered as the founder of a chapel at Watton. Appropriately, he was buried in the entry to the chapter house at Holy Trinity Priory.<br>
<br>Henry fitz Ailwin died on 19 September 1212, probably in London. Henry's wife, Margaret, who survived him, was probably the mother of his four sons. The eldest of these, Peter, married Isabel, daughter of Bartholomew de Chennay and heir to estates in Surrey and Sussex; she predeceased her husband and was buried in Bermondsey Priory. But Peter himself died before his father, who about a year before his own death divided his lands between his surviving sons, Alan, Thomas, and Richard. Peter's surviving daughter, Joan, inherited her parents' properties and then those of her uncles. Her second marriage brought the Candlewick Street site into the knightly Aguillon family, whose members used it as their London base until <i>c</i>.1286. In the meantime her grandfather's reputation remained high. By 1274 the complex body of city customs known as the assize of buildings had come to be attributed to the beginning of Henry fitz Ailwin's mayoralty, then dated to 1189. His obit continued to be observed, and his tomb was still recognizable in the sixteenth century. A later observer noted monuments to him at St Mary Bothaw.<br>
