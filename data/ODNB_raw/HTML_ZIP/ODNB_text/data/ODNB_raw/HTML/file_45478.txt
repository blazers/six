<span class="headword">Attaway, Mrs</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1645&#150;1646), <span class="occ">Baptist preacher</span>, was of unknown parentage and background. Her early years are obscure but by 1645 she was said to have been a London lacewoman with a husband in the army.<br>
<br>A member of Thomas Lambe's Baptist congregation, Attaway became convinced that she was filled with the presence of the Holy Spirit. Believing that none &#145;in the world this day living, had any Commission to preach&#146;, she began to &#145;Exercise her gifts&#146; with her &#145;Sister&#146;. At first this &#145;Exercise&#146; was restricted to women, but afterwards Attaway was persuaded to admit &#145;of all that pleased to come&#146;  (Edwards, 1.88). According to an informant of the heresiographer Thomas Edwards, on Tuesday 9 December 1645 Attaway and two other women came before &#145;some company&#146; assembled in a room in Bell Alley, Coleman Street:<blockquote>These women came with <span class="roman">Bibles</span> in their hands, and went to a Table; the Lace-woman tooke her place at the upper end &hellip; Then the Lace-woman began with making a speech to this purpose, That now those dayes were come, and that was fulfilled which was spoken of in the Scriptures, That God would poure out of his Spirit upon the handmaidens, and they should prophecy, and after this speech shee made a prayer for almost halfe an hour. (ibid., 1.85)</blockquote>Appalled by the &#145;confusion, horror, and disorder&#146;  (Edwards, 1.86) that he witnessed at the meeting, Edwards's informant departed before its conclusion. The following Tuesday there reportedly came &#145;a world of people, to the number of a Thousand first and last to Bell-Alley, to hear these women Preach&#146;  (ibid., 1.86&#150;7). Perhaps to accommodate the &#145;multitude&#146; that flocked to hear them, the women preached later that day at the home of a gentlewoman living in the Old Bailey. On Tuesday 30 December 1645 the women preached again, this time &#145;in a house near the French Church&#146;. A minister who heard them reported that he saw &#145;a great deal of lightnesse and vanity among some that were at that Exercise&#146;. On Thursday afternoon, 8 January 1646, &#145;near the French-Church at one Mrs. Hills&#146;, Attaway was said to have &#145;delivered many dangerous and false&#146; doctrines:<blockquote>1. That it could not stand with the goodnesse of God to damne his own creatures Eternally. 2. That God the Father did raign under the Law; God the Son under the Gospel; and now God the Father and God the Son are making over the Kingdom to God the Holy Ghost, and he shall be powred out upon all flesh. 3. That there shall be a generall Restauration, wherein all men shall be reconciled and saved. 4. That Christ died for all. (Edwards, 1.87)</blockquote>Edwards was to note that &#145;upon complaint&#146; Attaway was questioned by the parliamentary committee of examinations  (Edwards, 1, appx, 120). Elsewhere, he related how &#145;out of novelty&#146; two gentlemen of the inns of court &#145;went to hear the women preach&#146; and afterwards engaged Attaway in debate  (ibid., 2.10). Among &#145;other passages&#146; she spoke to them of John Milton's <span class="italic">The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</span> (1643), saying: &#145;she for her part would look more into it, for she had an unsanctified husband, that did not walk in the way of <i>Sion</i>, nor speak the language of <i>Canaan</i>&#146;  (ibid., 2.11).<br>
<br>On 26 February 1646 Edwards was informed by two &#145;godly understanding&#146; men  (Edwards, 1, appx, 120) that about two weeks before Attaway had deserted her children of six and seven, conveyed &#145;away&#146; all her goods of &#145;worth&#146;  (ibid., 1, appx, 121) and &#145;run away with another womans husband, with whom she had bin to familiar along time&#146;  (ibid., 1, appx, 120&#150;21). This man was William Jenney, one of Attaway's hearers and &#145;a preacher too&#146;. It was &#145;commonly reported&#146; that they had gone &#145;beyond seas&#146;. Edwards added that:<blockquote>'tis given out she met with a Prophet here in <i>London</i>, who hath revealed to her and others that they must go to Jerusalem, and repair Jerusalem, and for that end Mrs <i>Attaway</i> hath gotten money of some persons, ten pounds of one yong maid, and other money of others towards the building up of Jerusalem. (ibid., 1, appx, 121)</blockquote>It was said that this prophet was to &#145;come forth&#146; in the summer of 1646 with &#145;power to preach the generall Restauration of all things&#146;  (ibid., 2.176); doubtless he was the &#145;<i>Iew</i>&#146; of London who had previously been visited by some &#145;Sectaries&#146; of Colchester who believed that &#145;the day of Iudgement was suddenly come&#146;  (ibid., 1.89). Although the identity of this prophet is unknown, it seems that he sent letters to Attaway. He was also said to have &#145;given a roll forth&#146; in which &#145;many things are written, and who-ever hath that roll hath the spirit of prophecie&#146;  (ibid., 2.176). This &#145;great parchment role&#146; fell into Attaway's hands  (ibid., 3.26).<br>
<br>Attaway, Jenney, and &#145;some of their Tribe&#146; supposedly maintained that there was &#145;no hell but what was in the conscience&#146; and that &#145;the soules mortall&#146;. Attaway, in addition, allegedly held that:<blockquote>the Book of <span class="italic">Esdras</span> and some other Apocryphall Books were Canonicall Scriptures; that she should never dye, and that she should bring forth Children at <i>Jerusalem</i>, and that at <i>Jerusalem</i> she should meet with Christ, and enjoy him visibly. (Edwards, 3.26)</blockquote>Nothing more is known of her.<br>
