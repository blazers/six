<span class="headword">Clinton, Sir  William Henry</span>  (1769&#150;1846), <span class="occ">army officer and administrator</span>, was born on 23 December 1769 in Lyons, France, the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5681/', "General Sir Henry Clinton (1730&#150;1795)")</script> and his wife, Harriet, daughter of Thomas Carter. William and his younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5682/', "Sir Henry Clinton")</script>, spent their early childhood at the family home in Weybridge, Surrey, where, following the premature death of their mother in 1772 at the age of twenty-six, they were cared for by their aunt, Elizabeth Carter, who with her sister moved into the family home. In 1780, while his father was commanding the British forces in the United States, William was sent to Eton College. His brother joined him in 1782 and both left in 1785. Meanwhile, on 22 December 1784 William had been gazetted cornet in his father's regiment, the 7th light dragoons, and thereafter, thanks to his father's wealth and influence, promotion quickly followed. In 1786 he accompanied his father on a short tour of France and Switzerland. On 29 August they set off for the continent and early in the following month arrived at the home, near Neuch&acirc;tel, Switzerland, of Monsieur Traytorrens, a member of an illustrious family who had been patrons of Rousseau. Under the care of Traytorrens, Clinton spent a year in mainly rustic pursuits, though he was frequently entertained at the homes of neighbouring English residents and travellers, who included Mark Beaufoy and his wife. He also perfected his French, began to study German, and recorded the days' events in the journal that was to run almost unbroken for nearly sixty years. From Neuch&acirc;tel, Clinton travelled north to Valenciennes where, apart from a short break in England, he spent a further eight months, partly in the study of fortification. On 1 May 1788 he headed eastwards, visiting Brussels, Li&egrave;ge, Aachen, Cologne, Bonn, Koblenz, and Mayen, among other places. For much of his tour he was accompanied by his younger brother Henry, and the two travellers discovered that the influence of their famous father opened many doors, including those of several German electors and Count Metternich, father of the illustrious Austrian statesman. On 7 March 1787, while in Switzerland, Clinton had been promoted lieutenant. He was subsequently promoted captain into the 45th regiment on 9 June 1790 and captain in the 1st Grenadier guards on 14 July 1790. In 1793 Clinton saw his first action in the campaign in Flanders, and on his return in the following year he succeeded his kinsman Thomas Pelham Clinton as tory member for East Retford in Nottinghamshire. He retained his seat until 1796 but is known to have spoken only once in the Commons&#151;on the Flanders campaign, on 5 February 1795. Meanwhile, on 29 December 1794 he had been promoted lieutenant-colonel, and in August 1795 he accompanied General Doyle on his abortive campaign to the coast of France. On his twenty-sixth birthday Clinton succeeded his father in the family property and soon afterwards, in January 1796, was appointed aide-de-camp to the duke of York, in which capacity he acted, apart from a spell of duty in Ireland, until June 1799. On 14 March 1797 he had married Lady Louisa Dorothea Holroyd (1777&#150;1854), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13608/', "John Baker Holroyd, first earl of Sheffield")</script>. They had two sons, Henry and Frederick, both of whom became army officers, and four daughters, Lou, Anna, Maria, and Harriot.<br>
<br>In 1799 Clinton was on the continent with Colonel Ramsay and accompanied him on a secret mission to the Russian generals Korsakov and Suvorov, returning to England in October to resume his association with the duke of York at The Helder. It was Clinton's duty to bring home the news of the Alkmaar armistice. In June 1800 he was appointed acting deputy quartermaster in Egypt, on 1 January 1801 was promoted colonel by brevet, and was soon afterwards made inspector-general of foreign corps. In June of that year he was chosen to command a secret expedition, and on 23 July he took possession of Madeira, which he governed as a brigadier-general until the conclusion of the peace of Amiens in 1802. He then resumed his duties as inspector-general of foreign corps until that post was suppressed in December 1802. His success at this time prompted George III to recommend him for further employment, and he and his brother Henry were praised as soldiers of &#145;uncommon abilities&#146; who were &#145;well respected in their profession&#146;. In April 1803 he resumed his duties with the duke of York, this time as his military secretary. He returned to Ireland on 26 July 1804 as quartermaster-general but declined an invitation to join Lord Harrington's mission to Berlin in December 1805, informing Prime Minister Pitt that he felt unqualified for the task. He re-entered parliament in 1806, this time on the duke of Newcastle's interest at Boroughbridge in Yorkshire, and when present gave silent support to the Portland and Perceval ministries.<br>
<br>In May 1807 Clinton was sent on a secret mission to Charles XIII of Sweden but arrived too late to prevent the signing of an armistice with France. He nevertheless took the opportunity of meeting the king, visiting Malm&ouml;, Stralsund, Memel, and Copenhagen (among other places), and being thoroughly briefed by the British envoy, Lord Hutchinson. He was promoted major-general on 26 April 1808 but despite frequent applications to serve abroad was neglected for nearly four years. At the beginning of 1812 he was sent to Sicily, and while commanding the division at Messina he was seriously wounded. At the end of September 1812 he proceeded to Alicante to take command of the troops on the east coast of Spain until replaced in December by Major-General James Campbell, who was in his turn superseded by Sir John Murray. On his return from leave in April 1813 Clinton commanded the 1st division at the battle of Castalla, but fell out with Murray. In June 1813 the ineffectual Murray was himself replaced by Lord William Bentinck, who in September gave the command-in-chief back to Clinton. During the autumn and winter campaigns of 1813&#150;14 he had no great difficulty in keeping Mar&eacute;chal Suchet's forces in check and in forming the blockade of Barcelona that enabled Ferdinand VII of Spain to return. Part of Clinton's success was undoubtedly due to his humanitarianism as a general and especially to his fervent opposition to corporal punishment, which he later claimed to have reduced markedly among his troops in Spain, and afterwards in Portugal.<br>
<br>Clinton had been made lieutenant-general in 1813 and colonel of the 55th regiment in 1814. On his return to England in that year, unsuccessful efforts were made to obtain a barony for him, as well as the governorship of Gibraltar. However, on 2 January 1815 he was made a GCB and in June astonished the marquess of Hertford by stating that he now waived his own claims to a peerage in favour of the superior claims of his brother Henry. But Henry too was passed over, and this neglect rankled with Clinton for the rest of his life. In September 1815 he journeyed to Paris with Thomas Murdoch FRS in the hope of obtaining employment from the duke of Wellington. He returned to England empty-handed and for the next ten years (he failed to obtain the governorship of Nova Scotia in October 1819) remained without employment. During this period he took a more active part in politics, attending the Commons regularly and giving silent support to Lord Liverpool's ministry. In 1818 his patron transferred him to a seat for Newark and persuaded him, against his wishes, to stand again in 1820. In 1821 Henry Bathurst, secretary for war and the colonies, proposed him for the governorship of Barbados, which he failed to get.<br>
<br>Clinton's life took a new turn in November 1823, with his removal from Sheffield Lodge, on his father-in-law's east Sussex estate, to the much grander Cokenach at Barkway, near Royston, Hertfordshire, the property of Sir Francis Willes, a kinsman. He now saw himself as a gentleman farmer and, though only a leaseholder, began to invest heavily in a hitherto neglected estate. His appointment in 1825 to the lucrative post of lieutenant-general of the ordnance enabled him to continue his programme of improvement, and when, on Willes's death in 1827, he became the new owner of Cokenach he began to draw up ambitious plans for the mansion, which came to fruition in the extensive additions and alterations of 1833&#150;6 by Henry Harrison. Meanwhile, in December 1826 he had received the command of 600 men who were sent to Portugal to keep the peace against the Miguelist and Spanish threat. His personal popularity was such that he was offered, but declined, the command-in-chief of the Portuguese army. Eventually, after over a year of occupation, the troops were brought home by their commander in April 1828.<br>
<br>While in Portugal Clinton was offered the governorship of Mauritius but declined it. Soon after his return to England the finance committee voted to abolish his office at the ordnance. In February 1829 he resigned from the Commons. Although his promotion to general in July 1830 and the offer of the governorship of Madras in the same year were doubtless meant as compensation, he reserved bitter words in his journal for Wellington and his cabinet. Madras had to be declined due to ill health, and his rancour increased in 1835 when, for the second time, he was passed over for the governorship of Gibraltar. In retirement he was seldom idle, as he divided his time between Hertfordshire and London. He regularly visited and entertained, read French and German daily, rode, planted trees, and kept his (by now) voluminous journal. In 1842, at the age of seventy-three, he became lieutenant-general of Chelsea Hospital in London. He had been a commissioner at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst for many years, and it was while attending the general examination at Addiscombe College in 1845 that he caught a chill that led eventually to his death, at Cokenach on 16 February 1846. He was buried on 24 February at the parish church at Barkway, Hertfordshire.<br>
