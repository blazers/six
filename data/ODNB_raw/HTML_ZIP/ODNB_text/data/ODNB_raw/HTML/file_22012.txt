<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blois,  Peter  of</span>  (1125<span class="mult">x</span>30&#150;1212), <span class="occ">letter writer and ecclesiastic</span>, was born into a Breton family of minor nobility in or near Blois. Various nephews and other members of his family are mentioned in his letters, but only two are significant in his life: his brother, Guillaume, who became a monk and abbot in Sicily, and wrote plays and poems, and an uncle or cousin, Pierre de Blois, who was Peter's first tutor, wrote poetry, and became learned in Roman law.<h2>
<a name="Hisyearsintheschoolsc11401165"></a>His years in the schools, c.1140&#150;1165</h2>Since Blois was not a cathedral town in the twelfth century, it had no school that could provide education at an advanced level. So Peter, having briefly visited Paris (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 240; <span class="italic">Later Letters</span>, ed. Revell, no. 5), went to the school attached to the cathedral at Tours in the early 1140s, probably with Pierre de Blois as his personal tutor. Here he studied under the great master Bernard Silvestris, who taught literature and the art of writing, particularly letter-writing. Peter records that Bernard required him to learn by heart the letters of Hildebert, archbishop of Tours (<i>d</i>. 1133), and advised him to avoid myths and fables and to concentrate on history  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 101). His later works show that in the main he followed this advice. As part of his course Peter also studied poetry, and (according to his own account) wrote lascivious verses in his youth and poems on moral and contemporary issues in later life  (ibid., ep. 57). None of his early, and only about ten of his later, poems have so far been satisfactorily identified, despite attempts to add to their number.<br>
<br>After his literary education in Tours, Peter went to Bologna, where he studied Roman law, having the later archbishop of Canterbury Baldwin (<i>d</i>. 1190) as his tutor, and Umberto Crivelli (afterwards Pope Urban III) as one of the masters whose lectures both he and Baldwin attended  (<span class="italic">Later Letters</span>, ed. Revell, no. 10n.). During these years he developed a great admiration for Roman law; but, to judge from his description of himself as being violently attracted and mentally inebriated by &#145;the secular law, wantoning in its glorious panoply of words and its elegant urbanity of speech&#146;  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 26), he admired its verbal grandeur more than its legal doctrine. Consequently it is not surprising that when in 1186 his knowledge of Roman law was tested in the papal court, he was badly beaten, and this disappointment was one cause of the change in his outlook which will be examined later.<br>
<br>From the study of Roman law Peter turned to theology, and this caused him about 1155 to move from Bologna to Paris. On his arrival he wrote the letter to his former master mentioned above, regretting the change and adding that he still read his Roman-law texts for recreation. However, an emended version of this letter made about thirty years later mentions Roman law and lawyers with great acerbity.<br>
<br>Peter continued his studies in Paris until 1166, supporting himself (like many other advanced students) by taking pupils, among whom were two sons of Jocelin de Bohun, bishop of Salisbury  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 51). One of these pupils, Reginald Fitzjocelin (<i>d</i>. 1191), after encountering opposition in which Peter played the part of sympathetic observer  (ibid., ep. 30), was consecrated bishop of Bath in 1174.<br>
<br>Although Peter has left few details of his Parisian studies or of the masters under whom he studied, his later works show him to have been familiar with all three of the main styles of theological study current at Paris during these years&#151;the allegorical interpretation in which Richard of St Victor was pre-eminent; the historical matter of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, which Peter Comestor organized; and the systematic and analytical study of doctrine, in which Peter Lombard was supreme. The historical facts and allegorical interpretations of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> alone are conspicuous in Peter's works until the last decade of his life, when his letters show that he had preserved analytical theological notes of his Parisian years which he used in answering some of the questions of his correspondents  (<span class="italic">Later Letters</span>, ed. Revell, no. 37). Overall, therefore, there is abundant evidence that Peter's studies at Tours, Bologna, and Paris embraced comprehensively the literary, legal, and theological sciences of his day. His only problem was to find employment commensurate with the long labour of laying the foundations.<h2>
<a name="Searchforemployment11651174"></a>Search for employment, 1165&#150;1174</h2>By 1165, while supporting himself by taking pupils, Peter was looking round for a career in the world of government. He had an uncle who was bishop of Perigord, whom he tried, without success, to interest in his future  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 34). He also had hopes&#151;which he never entirely abandoned&#151;of getting a substantial canonry at Chartres. (He did in fact get canonries at both Rouen and Chartres but they provided little or no revenue; ibid., epp. 128, 130; <span class="italic">Later Letters</span>, ed. Revell, nos. 6, 13.) So, for a career, he had to look elsewhere, and his first serious opportunity arose in 1166 from the premature death of King William of Sicily, who left as his heir a young son aged twelve in the care of his widow, Margaret. She was a member of the family of the counts of Perche, and&#151;surrounded as she was by Sicilian barons who had opposed her husband on several occasions and from whom she could hope for no support&#151;she wrote to her French relatives, and particularly to Rotrou, archbishop of Rouen, for help. As a result of this appeal, a band of French adventurers and relatives was gathered to help the widowed queen in the government of Sicily and of course to promote their own interests. Peter and his brother Guillaume both joined them.<br>
<br>In the end no fewer than thirty-seven adventurers were collected, and they arrived in Sicily in September 1166 ready to take over the administration of a country with a unique combination of Arab, Norman, and Sicilian people, of whose habits and expectations the newcomers knew nothing. For a very short time all went well: Peter became tutor to the young king and keeper of the royal seal, and his brother became abbot of Santa Maria di Maniaci near Maletto  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, epp. 46, 66, 93). But the whole enterprise had very frail foundations, and in the autumn of 1168 most of the newcomers were driven out by the local baronage. Peter was lucky to escape with his life on a ship which took him to Genoa, whence he made his way back to northern France determined never again to move if he could stay in his native land  (ibid., ep. 90).<br>
<br>Despite its failure, this unlucky initiative proved to be the beginning of Peter's future career, for Archbishop Rotrou, who seems to have been the cause of his going to Sicily, began employing him to write letters. This brought him into the ambience of Angevin politics in the last stage of the conflict between Henry II and Archbishop Thomas Becket, which was largely conducted as a war of letters. Since this was Peter's speciality, he was soon engaged as a letter writer, first on behalf of Archbishop Rotrou, and then in association with his old pupil Reginald Fitzjocelin, who was one of Henry II's main agents in conducting his case against Thomas Becket, and who&#151;as a result of royal influence&#151;was elected bishop of Bath in April 1173. In view of his association with Henry II's campaign against Thomas Becket, Reginald had a very stormy passage in getting his election ratified  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 30); but this was finally achieved, and shortly afterwards Peter got his first steady employment as chief letter writer and later chancellor in the household of Richard of Dover, Thomas Becket's successor in the archbishopric of Canterbury (elected June 1173 and consecrated April 1174). Peter would greatly have preferred to stay in France, but there were many more administrative posts available in England, so he had reluctantly to settle down in a country whose language he never managed to learn  (ibid., ep. 160). Of course even his employment at Canterbury was only for the lifetime of the archbishop, but greater security came in 1182 when, a vacancy in the archdeaconry of Bath having occurred, Reginald Fitzjocelin made Peter his archdeacon. Thus, at the age of about fifty-five, Peter at last had a position that gave him security for life; and, while he was a member of the archbishop's staff, the archdeacon's work could be done by a deputy.<h2>
<a name="Thedecadeofconspicuousachievement11741184"></a>The decade of conspicuous achievement, 1174&#150;1184</h2>Peter now had a stimulating position at the heart of Angevin government, and it was a further satisfaction that, besides his skill in letter-writing, he had begun writing remarkably vivid treatises in which he brought the biblical teaching of the Parisian schools to audiences both of clergy and of laity. In particular his two short works on the conversion of St Paul and the transfiguration of Jesus sufficiently impressed the exceptionally literate Henry II for him to ask Peter to write something specially for him. Thereupon Peter wrote his <span class="italic">Compendium in Job</span>, in which&#151;writing in his moments of leisure between (in his words) &#145;camps and courts&#146;&#151;he drew on Gregory the Great's <span class="italic">Moralia in Job</span> and the sermons of St Bernard to urge the king to bear his trials with fortitude in the confident expectation of a happy ending.<br>
<br>In many ways these were the happiest days of Peter's life. He was busy as the official eulogist of Angevin government after the disasters of the rebellion of the king's sons and the catastrophe of Thomas Becket's murder, and he started writing an account of Henry II's reign which he called <span class="italic">De praestigiis fortunae</span> (&#145;The deceptions of fortune&#146;), which he mentions more often than any of his other works. When he was writing this work he evidently thought that Henry II was going to triumph over his misfortunes and thus prove the deceptiveness of fortune. As will become evident, this hope was itself to prove deceptive as Henry collapsed under the weight of his misfortunes, and Peter's laudatory work has not survived.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, although he lamented the horrors of the itinerating court with its bad food, uncertain lodgings, and execrable drink  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 14), Peter was basically content. He was twice at the papal court, in 1169 and 1179. On one of these occasions, probably in 1169, he wrote in the pope's name an <span class="italic">Instructio fidei catholicae</span> (&#145;Instruction in the Catholic faith&#146;) for the Muslim sultan of Konia, which Matthew Paris a hundred years later thought a sufficiently important example of learning elegantly presented in the service of Christendom to be transcribed in full into his chronicle. His visit in 1179 gave him a rather different claim to fame: he borrowed money which he failed to repay and the pope's letter to the archbishop of Canterbury on behalf of the creditor found a permanent place in the code of canon law issued by Gregory IX in 1234  (<span class="italic">Liber Extra</span>, 3.22.3). In short, during the years 1174&#150;84 Peter was at the centre of Angevin government in its most prosperous days, and he was in touch with the greatest men and events of his time.<br>
<br>In the full flood of his prosperity Peter wrote a letter, which can be dated between 1182 and 1184, to his namesake and old tutor, in his most grandiloquent style: &#145;I rejoice with all my heart in our identity of name &hellip; Our writings have carried our fame throughout the world so that neither flood nor fire nor any calamity nor the passage of time can obliterate our name&#146;  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 77). It is evident from this boastful effusion that Peter already looked on writing, and more particularly letter-writing, as the occupation most likely to bring the fame that he ardently desired, and this helps to explain his next enterprise.<h2>
<a name="Thepivotalyear1184"></a>The pivotal year, 1184</h2>In February 1184 Archbishop Richard died, and Peter's future was once more uncertain, for&#151;if the new archbishop did not employ him&#151;he would have no excuse for not descending to the local duties of a rural archdeacon. So these were anxious months for him. According to his own account the king offered him the bishopric of Rochester, which was vacant from August 1184 to July 1185, but what he most dearly desired was fame, and he used the period of uncertainty and leisure between the death of the old and the appointment of a new archbishop to consolidate his claim to fame by making a collection of his letters which he dedicated to the king  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 1).<br>
<br>Peter's collection was different from earlier letter collections of the eleventh and twelfth centuries in that it was made for general circulation by the writer himself in mid-career, and therefore it was available for the author's addition of new letters and changes in the texts of earlier letters in accordance with his changing views or aims. The aim of the collection was ostensibly to teach the art of letter-writing, but in fact, as is evident from his letter to his namesake mentioned above, his real aim was to make himself known to future generations. It is very likely that the first collection which he made in 1184 already contained many alterations in the texts that had actually been dispatched, and he went on correcting and making omissions or additions to the texts until about 1202, after which he seems to have lost interest in the collection amid other occupations.<br>
<br>In association with this collection, Peter wrote a brief manual on the art of letter-writing. Only one copy of this has survived (CUL, MS Dd.9.38) and its authenticity has often, though almost certainly wrongly, been denied. At all events, though the manual won few if any readers, the letter collection became one of the most widely distributed works of the twelfth century.<br>
<br>By the time the collection had been made and the short manual written, Peter's months of leisure were brought to an end by the appointment of the new archbishop in November 1184. From Peter's point of view the king's choice of an archbishop&#151;and it was most emphatically the king's choice and not that of the Canterbury monks&#151;could not have been happier for Peter: it was Baldwin, bishop of Worcester, who had been his friend and tutor in Bologna and who at once appointed Peter as his main legal adviser and letter writer. The position opened up more interesting prospects than ever before with&#151;most unluckily as it turned out&#151;more emphasis on his legal learning than his epistolary skill. Baldwin was a much more active man than his predecessor, and he at once undertook to build new headquarters near Canterbury for his staff. Moreover, with the death of Henry, the most rebellious of Henry II's sons, in 1183, it seemed as if a new order of governmental growth and peace was about to begin, with Peter at its hub, writing his triumphal account of Henry's reign. The reality however turned out to be very different.<h2>
<a name="Thedecadeoffailureanddoubt11841194"></a>The decade of failure and doubt, 1184&#150;1194</h2>For Peter and the new archbishop, as also for Henry II and western Europe generally, things began to go wrong almost at once. At the local level, it was necessary to get papal consent for the new archiepiscopal headquarters. The monks of Canterbury, who were enjoying unprecedented prosperity as a result of the offerings of the huge numbers of pilgrims to the tomb of their new martyr, Thomas Becket, were violently opposed to the archbishop's project as tending to the diminishment of their influence in his counsels. Moreover they could afford to employ an outstanding Roman lawyer, a certain Pillius, to conduct their case at the papal court. So, after protracted preliminary tussles between the archbishop and the monks, Peter was obliged to go to the papal court to answer the objections of the monks to the archbishop's plans, and he spent the months from March 1187 to January 1188 on this mission, travelling through northern Italy with the papal court.<br>
<br>These months are very fully documented in the letters that the monks' representatives at the papal court sent back to Canterbury  (Stubbs, <span class="italic">Epistolae Cantuarienses</span>). They show Peter spending several weeks at Verona arguing the archbishop's case against Pillius, and being defeated all along the line. Then, when the papal court moved from Verona to Ferrara in October 1187, Peter rode with Pope Urban III, his old professor of Roman law, and tried a last plea, reminding the pope that he and Baldwin had been fellow students under him at Bologna  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 152). This attempt at lobbying so incensed the pope that he had a heart attack and died next day. This of course delayed Peter's defeat, but he had never had any prospect of success. After the rapid election of a new pope, Gregory VIII, he had to spend a further three months itinerating with the papal court until at Pisa&#151;shortly before Christmas&#151;Pope Gregory also died. A new pope, Clement III, was then elected, and Peter spent a further month suffering the long ignominy of inevitable defeat before his return to England.<br>
<br>These tribulations helped to destroy Peter's earlier regard for Roman law. A small symptom of this can be seen in the alterations that he made in the old letter of thirty years earlier which he had written when he had just come from Bologna to study theology in Paris (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 26; for the two versions, see Wahlgren, 72&#150;80). In its original form it is full of praise for Roman law; but, as revised about 1190, praise has been replaced by recriminations against Roman lawyers. This change is symptomatic of a painful personal experience. But much more important, even for his own future, was the stream of news that arrived at the papal court while Peter was in attendance. First there was the news of the defeat of the crusading army at Hattin in July 1187, followed by the martyrdom of the French leader Renaud de Ch&acirc;tillon, and finally by the fall of Jerusalem on 2 October. In a brief businesslike letter, which he did not include in his letter collection, Peter reported the arrival of news of these disasters to Henry II, and Roger of Howden, who was at the royal court, put it in his chronicle.<br>
<br>These events destroyed Peter's confidence in the state of Western Christendom; and he was further shaken when he got back to France to find that the struggles of Henry II and his sons, which had seemed to have been successfully concluded ten years earlier, had now reached their fatal climax leading to the despair and death of Henry II on 6 July 1189.<br>
<br>This combination of disasters changed his whole picture of the safety and stability of western Europe and of Henry II as a successful ruler, and for the next few years he directed all his literary energies to new themes: a hagiographical work on the life of Renaud de Ch&acirc;tillon; a dialogue between the abbot of Bonneval and Henry II about the causes of the disasters of the time; and a passionate plea for a concentration of all the energies of Christendom on a new crusade. These themes fill most of Peter's writing in the period 1188&#150;9; and they culminated in his setting out at the end of 1189, closely followed by the archbishop of Canterbury, among the first of the English contingent on the third crusade. They travelled with Richard I as far as Sicily, and then they pressed on to join the crusading army at Tyre while the king stayed in Sicily to await the arrival of his mother, Queen Eleanor, with his destined bride, Berengaria of Navarre.<br>
<br>Within a month of their arrival at Tyre, the archbishop died, on 20 November 1190, and this left Peter no alternative but to find his own way back to England. He returned to Sicily, which he reached at about the same time as Eleanor of Aquitaine who had brought Richard's bride. The marriage took place on 12 May, and Queen Eleanor left Sicily at once. Peter probably travelled with her through Italy and France; then, while Eleanor stayed in France, he went on and arrived back in England in the autumn of 1191.<br>
<br>At first it seemed likely that Peter would continue as the principal member of the new archbishop's staff, for on 27 November his old friend and pupil Reginald Fitzjocelin was elected archbishop. This prospect, however, was destroyed by Reginald's death within a month of his election, and there was a long vacancy at Canterbury until December 1193 when Hubert Walter, the most efficient of the administrators available to Richard I, became archbishop of Canterbury. He sometimes consulted Peter on particular points during the next few years, but he never gave him a position in his household. Consequently, Peter was in danger of being reduced to the necessity of having to perform his duties as archdeacon, for which he had always employed a deputy  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 157).<br>
<br>Peter seems to have sought employment with Queen Eleanor, for he wrote three letters in her name to the pope protesting against King Richard's imprisonment in Germany in violation of his immunity as a crusader; and two more on the same subject, one to the pope in the name of the archbishop of Rouen, and another in his own name to the archbishop of Mainz, with whom he had shared lodgings when they were students together in Paris, urging him also to write to the pope  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, epp. 144&#150;6, 64, 143). But if he hoped for employment with Queen Eleanor, his hopes were dashed, and he had to look elsewhere.<br>
<br>One possibility was Odo, bishop of Paris, to whom he wrote in 1197&#150;8 seeking a position in his chapter  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, epp. 127, 160). Another possibility was Geoffrey, an illegitimate son of Henry II and archbishop of York from 1191 to 1212, with whom he clearly had some short-lived position about 1199, and to whom he dedicated a life of St Wilfrid, which was seen in the sixteenth century by the antiquary John Leland but is now lost. Nothing came of this. So he had to face the fact that there was no further role for him in the world of politics, and he found solace in new intellectual and spiritual interests.<h2>
<a name="Peterstheologicalandspiritualworks11951212"></a>Peter's theological and spiritual works, 1195&#150;1212</h2>As a first step Peter seems to have contemplated making a revised edition of his letters with many theological additions culled largely from recent Parisian theology. Two contemporary manuscripts of his letter collection with these additions have survived which exemplify this ill-conceived plan (LPL, MS 421, and Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, MS C. 103 sup.). But the additions clearly made the letters unreadable, and they have not been found in any other copies of the letter collection.<br>
<br>Much more successfully, Peter began to take a new interest in the spiritual life of the Cistercians and Carthusians and in theological and devotional questions. These interests led to a new series of works: &#145;On friendship&#146;, &#145;On penance&#146;, &#145;On confession&#146;, &#145;On faith&#146;, &#145;On the episcopal office&#146;. In substance none of these works was original, but to all of them he brought a new style and new illustrative quotations. In particular, his <span class="italic">Tractatus de fide</span> (&#145;On faith&#146;) was based on Archbishop Baldwin's <span class="italic">Liber de commendatione fidei</span>; and his treatise &#145;On friendship&#146; was an elaboration of the work of the Cistercian Ailred of Rievaulx, to which Peter added many classical quotations. He also rewrote two ancient saints' lives: his life of St Wilfrid, already mentioned, and a life of St Guthlac of Crowland, giving both of them a modernity of style and spiritual outlook.<br>
<br>This whole body of work testifies to the changing direction of Peter's thoughts; but, so far as his immediate future was concerned, his most significant step was to dedicate his work &#145;On friendship&#146; to an old acquaintance in the royal household, William de Sainte M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise, who became bishop of London in 1199 (for the dedication, see <span class="italic">Later Letters</span>, ed. Revell, no. 78).<br>
<br>Whether as cause or effect, this dedication is associated with the new bishop's offering Peter the archdeaconry of London, which he accepted. This of course was not promotion, but it fitted well with his new range of interests by giving him a position in which he met a continuing flow of people who went to London on business and with whom he discussed many theological problems. The letters that he wrote as a result of these discussions generally have no merits as examples of epistolary style and he never added them to his letter collection; but they have a great interest in disclosing the extent to which the problems discussed in the schools had become part of the mental equipment of large numbers of clergy in every level of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. These new interests seem also to have stirred in him a search for a deeper religious experience, and he wrote three letters to Pope Innocent III protesting against the lack of warmth in the language of the mass  (<span class="italic">Later Letters</span>, ed. Revell, nos. 1&#150;3). So, even though he had now lost his position at the centre of government which had provided the opportunity for writing many of his earlier letters, he was fully occupied probing more deeply into theological and devotional problems as he sank into a quiet old age.<br>
<br>Like many clergy, Peter spent some time in France during the great interdict from 1208 to 1213 when the normal activities of the church were suspended and clergy in administrative positions were footloose. This seems once more to have renewed his hope of settling down at Chartres. He may even have died there for his death was recorded both at Chartres and at Rouen; but, wherever he died, his death was known in London in February 1212, and must have taken place shortly before this date.<h2>
<a name="Peterslifeandworkinmodernscholarshiphisproseworks"></a>Peter's life and work in modern scholarship: his prose works</h2>All Peter's works, whether letters, sermons, or treatises, had the same general purpose of bringing the learning of the schools to bear on religious and practical affairs of every description, and it is this that gives a lasting interest to nearly everything that he wrote.<br>
<br>Peter was certainly prodigiously fluent, and he had a ready command of most areas of the scholastic learning of his day. As evidence of his fluency he claimed that he could, and at least sometimes did, write four letters simultaneously, dictating three and writing the fourth with his own hand. This of course is not impossible, but its literal truth is placed in doubt by its reflecting a skill possessed by Julius Caesar, as reported by Pliny and repeated by John of Salisbury  (<span class="italic">Policraticus</span>, 5, chap. 8), from whom Peter, who never hesitated over appropriating other men's learning, probably borrowed it. After all, the great schools of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries came into existence to make the learning of the past available for the needs of the present; and, in being a great appropriator, Peter of Blois was carrying out this plan.<h2>
<a name="Peterspoetry"></a>Peter's poetry</h2>The only direct evidence about Peter's poetry comes from three of his letters. In an early letter  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, ep. 12) he asks a nephew to send him the <i>versus et ludicra</i> that he had written when he was (presumably as a student) at Tours. Thereafter no more is heard about his verses until, in a letter  (ibid., ep. 57) in the second recension of the collection of about 1190, he writes to a friend who, having entered a religious order and suffered a good deal of boredom, asked Peter to send him some of his amatory poems. In his reply, Peter acknowledged that he had written such poems in his youth, but he attached to his letter only a few verses in his later, more mature style. A few years later, in revising his letter collection after his return from the crusade, as well as adding several new letters, he added to <i>epistola</i> 57 a few more poems of serious religious instruction or indignation at the captivity of Richard I on his return from the crusade  (&#145;Epistolae&#146;, 1127&#150;36).<br>
<br>The existence of the poems attached to <i>epistola</i> 57 has naturally raised the question whether there are others that can be identified, and there are certainly a few. In particular two poems (published by Braunholtz in <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Romanische Philologie</span>, 1927) in praise of wine may safely be added; and, most unexpectedly, there are a few lines ascribed to &#145;that excellent letter writer [<i>dictator</i>] Peter of Blois&#146;, in a German polemical work (<span class="italic">Chronica regia Coloniensis</span>) written in the neighbourhood of Cologne about 1206. Three poems in the <span class="italic">Carmina burana</span>, attributed to Peter of Blois by the editors in 1930 on grounds of similarity of language and style, may also be added as borderline cases.<br>
<br>So are there any more additions that can be made? This is a question that has occupied scholars for many years. The greatest stimulus in provoking a search for new poems was the publication in 1925 of the poems of Gautier of Ch&acirc;tillon, a contemporary of Peter of Blois and one of the great poets of the twelfth century, who in one of his poems mentions Peter of Blois as one of the four most accomplished poets of the time. But which Peter of Blois was he referring to&#151;the letter writer or his namesake and tutor? The failure to answer this question properly is one reason why the additions suggested by various eminent scholars and finally and most lavishly of all by Peter Dronke are either certainly or probably not by the letter writer. It must however be added that the last named scholar has provided by far the best texts of some of the letter writer's authentic poems.<h2>
<a name="Posthumousreputation"></a>Posthumous reputation</h2>The interest in Peter of Blois after his death was almost entirely centred on his letters, which continued until the seventeenth century to have readers who appreciated their style, their widely ranging quotations from classical authors, and their vivacity. Through these claims on their attention, Peter's letters would have taught their readers skill in observing the prose rhythms which were required in correctly written letters. The papal curia was by far the most important source of authoritative letters at the time when Peter made his first collection of letters, and the stylistic rules for papal letters, including the elaboration of strict rules of prose rhythm known as the <i>cursus</i>, had been stabilized at the papal court at the time when Peter was writing his early letters. He outlined them in his treatise on letter-writing and he observed them in his letters. Indeed one reason for the lack of success of his very jejune theoretical work may have been that the rules could be learnt much better from his letters themselves, where, besides the rules of <i>cursus</i>, the reader would find examples of careful structure and the use of convincing authorities. In brief, while teaching the rules of letter-writing as an essential tool of government, Peter's letters also made interesting reading for times, such as meals, when short texts were called for; and many found in them pleasure as well as instruction. Even as late as the seventeenth century, when the practical utility of the medieval rules of letter-writing had become obsolete, the first serious editor of his letters, J. Busaeus, in 1601 in his preface recommended them &#145;for their vivacity of expression and their wealth of doctrine&#146;; and their next editor, Pierre de Goussainville in 1667, echoed these words.<br>
<br>So, in the mid-seventeenth century, Peter of Blois's letters were still being read as living literature; but by its end, both the rules he exemplified and the subjects that made his letters interesting had lost their power of eliciting admiration, and the nineteenth-century scholars who re-edited or reprinted Peter's letters did so solely for their historical information, and they blamed them for not giving more.<br>
<br>It should be added that Peter was also an indefatigable writer of sermons. These too he collected, and they show his total recall of the text of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. But they lack the variety of themes that made his letters famous, and they never had more than a very modest circulation.<br>
