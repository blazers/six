</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Daiches,  David</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born at 2 Salem Hill South, Sunderland, co. Durham, on 2 September 1912, the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75179/', "Salis Daiches (1880&#150;1945)")</script>, rabbi and author, and his wife, Flora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levin (1890&#150;1983). He and his elder brother Lionel (1911&#150;1999), later an advocate, were the first generation to break with the rabbinical family tradition: they and their two sisters, Sylvia (1914&#150;1996), subsequently a noted French scholar and university lecturer, and Beryl (1923&#150;1964), were descended from a long line of rabbis going back at least 500 years. In March 1919 the family moved from Sunderland, where his father had been minister to its Jewish community, to Edinburgh, where Salis Daiches became minister at the Graham Street Synagogue and subsequently the unofficial Scottish-Jewish spiritual leader. In his first autobiography, <span class="italic">Two Worlds: an Edinburgh Jewish Childhood</span> (1956), David Daiches wrote that the move to Edinburgh &#145;was the true beginning of my life as I remember it for I remember my childhood as a developing relation between family tradition and my sense of Edinburgh&#146;  (p. 17). This sense of duality, of existing in two worlds, of accommodation, pervaded Daiches's life and work.<br>
<br>Educated at George Watson's College, the &#145;bastion of gentile Edinburgh education&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 July 2005), Daiches was unable to participate in school games, sports, or the literary society which met on Friday evenings. It was at that time that he<blockquote>became acutely aware of living in two worlds, or rather of moving freely between one and the other. Bagpipe music and synagogue melody represented the two poles between which my sensibility moved. I accepted this dualism as part of the nature of things. (<span class="italic">Two Worlds</span>, 60)</blockquote>He was already writing poems: his first publication, a poem &#145;The Fountain in Moonlight&#146;, appeared in the school magazine, <span class="italic">The Watsonian</span>, in December 1923. In his final year at school, 1930, he walked away with various prizes, including a scholarship to Edinburgh University, where he graduated in 1934 with first-class honours in rhetoric and English literature. He chose English because of his passion for poetry. At Edinburgh special influences were H. J. C. Grierson, the great John Donne and Walter Scott scholar, and the Shakespearean scholar John Dover Wilson. Daiches wrote articles, reviews, poems, and letters for <span class="italic">The Student</span> during the years 1932&#150;4, under the pseudonym Quidam, and ran the university English Literature Society. The first book he edited belongs to this period: <span class="italic">Private Business</span> (1933), a collection of poems by him and his contemporary student poets in the society including Sorley Maclean and Robert Garioch.<br>
<br>In 1934 Daiches won an Elton exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford. In a memorial address to the English department at Aberdeen University sixty years later, with characteristic frankness he recalled that &#145;because I wasn't used to handling money I spent my three years' money in my first year and I had nothing left to complete my Oxford doctorate&#146;. He &#145;wrote to Grierson &hellip; and I asked him if he could give me an assistant lectureship at the University for a year so that I could recoup my finances and go back to Oxford to finish my doctorate. By return of post &hellip; I got a letter of appointment&#146;  (&#145;Memories of Grierson&#146;, 31). After a year as assistant in English at Edinburgh (1935&#150;6) he returned to Balliol as Andrew Bradley fellow for 1936&#150;7. In 1937 he married Isobel (Billie) Mackay (<i>d</i>. 1977), a fellow student at Edinburgh who became a librarian. They had one son, Alan (1940&#150;2006), later a photographer, and two daughters, Elizabeth 
    (Liz; 1946&#150;2008)
   and Jennifer 
    (Jenni; <i>b</i>. 1941)
  , who married the historian and literary critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99794/', "Angus Calder")</script>; as Jenni Calder she became a distinguished poet and literary critic, and wrote movingly about both her parents in <span class="italic">Not Nebuchadnezzar: in Search of Identities</span> (2005).<br>
<br>Daiches received his DPhil degree in 1939 for a thesis on the development and sources of the King James version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> with special reference to the Hebrew tradition (published as <span class="italic">The King James Version of the English Bible</span>, 1941). In the same year he accepted an academic position in America at the University of Chicago, partly for his father's sake: Daiches's marriage to a gentile had placed his father, an orthodox rabbi, in an embarrassing situation. Following four years at Chicago, and war service in the British embassy in Washington and British information services in New York (1944&#150;6), Daiches became a very popular and influential professor at Cornell University. He wrote of this American period in his second volume of autobiography, <span class="italic">A Third World</span> (1971). His students included the prolific author Harold Bloom. His friendship with a colleague, the distinguished critic of Romanticism, Meyer H. Abrams, led to the influential textbook <span class="italic">The Norton Anthology of English Literature</span>. First published in 1962, by the year 2000 it was in its seventh edition. Daiches was responsible for the twentieth-century section in the first four editions, from 1962 to 1979. During these years, in addition to producing thirty-six books, innumerable academic articles, and reviews, Daiches wrote poetry published in the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>.<br>
<br>In 1951, making what Daiches subsequently described as an unfortunate career move, he and his family returned to Britain. His real motive was to obtain a chair at a Scottish university. He spent the years 1951&#150;61 as a university lecturer in English at Cambridge (he was a fellow of Jesus College from 1957), and writing prolifically. His <span class="italic">Critical Approaches to Literature</span> (1956; 2nd edn, 1981) and his scholarly and analytical multi-volume <span class="italic">A Critical History of English Literature</span> (1960; 2nd rev. edn, 1994), as so much of his work, anticipated future literary fashions and concerns, recognizing the crucial role played by literary criticism and theory in literary study. Alastair Fowler, the eminent Renaissance literary scholar, viewed Daiches's extensive treatment of Milton in the critical history as anticipating subsequent work by Stanley Fish and others. Milton had already been the subject of a book-length study by Daiches (1957; new rev. edn, 1969) and various individual essays. His earlier books, <span class="italic">Virginia Woolf</span> (1942; rev. edn, 1963) and <span class="italic">Willa Cather: a Critical Introduction</span> (1951; new edn, 1962), anticipated later feminist interests. <span class="italic">The Novel and the Modern World</span> (1939; rev. edn, 1960) and <span class="italic">Poetry and the Modern World: a Study of Poetry in England between 1900 and 1939</span> (1940) prefigured many of the concerns of later historians of modernism, while his earlier <span class="italic">Literature and Society</span> (1938) had explored the complex relationship between the production of literature and the social conditions in which the writer lives, a central concern of academics in the field of cultural studies at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Daiches continued his reviewing activities in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, <span class="italic">New Republic</span>, <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">New York Times Book Review</span>, <span class="italic">Commentary</span>, and similar newspapers and journals on both sides of the Atlantic. He also began broadcasting frequently on the radio: his appearances on the <span class="italic">Brains Trust</span> made him a national celebrity and radio voice.<br>
<br>Recruited by Asa Briggs in 1961, Daiches was one of the founding fathers of the University of Sussex. <span class="italic">The Idea of a New University: an Experiment in Sussex</span> (1964; 2nd edn, 1970), edited by Daiches, explained the ideas behind the university and its foundation. In his essay &#145;The place of English studies in the Sussex scheme&#146; he described his differing experiences of the academic study of English and his conception of a new school of English and American studies. Janet Burroway described him at this time as<blockquote>large-hearted, witty, erudite, and vain. He expected to be the centre of attention, but he had no tinge of the little-man's Napoleonic meanness. His natural state of being was delight: delight in language, family, history, babies, rhyme schemes, verbal trickery, anybody's happiness, unblended whisky, high discourse, repartee and praise. (Baker and Lister, 31&#150;2)</blockquote>Daiches's lectures were replete with brilliant insights. His explication of Shakespeare's sonnets emphasized the relationships in them between personal affection and money contained in a word such as &#145;dear&#146;. Comments on Yeats's &#145;Byzantium&#146; poems contained an overwhelming sense of mutability, the line &#145;Of what is past, or passing, or to come&#146; having all the tenses subsumed. He also drew attention to the illusion of all time conquered in Keats's &#145;Ode to Autumn&#146;, and the brilliant observation in Wallace Stevens's &#145;Sunday Morning&#146; that in a secular world the pigeon replaces the dove.<br>
<br>The first of Daiches's 100 or so books, <span class="italic">The Place of Meaning in Poetry</span>, was published in 1935. The last, <span class="italic">A Weekly Scotsman and Other Poems</span>, containing seventy-five of his poems spanning six decades, appeared in 1994. Aside from a mass of journalism and academic articles, he was also the editor of general series including <span class="roman">Studies in English Literature</span>, published by Arnold from 1961 to 1985, to which he contributed what was regarded by many as the best short critical analysis of George Eliot's <span class="italic">Middlemarch</span> (1963). He published extensively on Walter Scott's achievement as a novelist, and advocated Scott's cause as a consummate artist in the years in which Scott was out of critical fashion. In 1984 he became the vice-chairman of the advisory board of the Edinburgh edition of the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels; indeed he was described as the godfather of this edition. Hugh MacDiarmid, whose <span class="italic">At the Sign of the Thistle</span> Daiches favourably reviewed in <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span> in 1934, referred to Daiches as the &#145;foremost living authority on [Scottish] literature&#146;  (MacDiarmid, 97). Daiches also served as the chair of the advisory board for the edition of <span class="italic">The Collected Works of James Hogg</span>. A pioneer of American studies in Britain, Daiches made significant contributions to many areas of literary studies, including the modern novel, as well as English, biblical, and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century studies. But poetry was his first love. As well as writing poetry, he produced powerful new critical explications of passages from writers as diverse as Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, Yeats, and Dylan Thomas. In addition to his frequent broadcasts on the radio and appearances on television, his sound recordings included a memorable discussion with the critic Barbara Hardy on George Eliot and Jane Austen, and readings with L. C. Knights from <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>.<br>
<br>Daiches's contributions to Scottish literature and culture may perhaps be regarded as his most significant. All his writing was pervaded with the sense of duality that he experienced growing up in Edinburgh. He saw dualities in the work of many Scottish writers, including Stevenson, Allan Ramsay, MacDiarmid, and James Thomson. The range and depth of his knowledge of Scottish literature was extensive: from Henryson and Dunbar to Fergusson and Burns, through to the late twentieth century. As his daughter Jenni observed, &#145;There is no one who has done more than he has to regenerate engagement with Scottish literature and the wider Scottish cultural context&#146;  (Calder, &#145;Reading, Writing and Reverberations&#146;, 11).<br>
<br>Daiches's non-literary works extended from his evocation of the history and topography of Scotland's two first cities, <span class="italic">Glasgow</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">Edinburgh</span> (1978), to <span class="italic">Literary Landscapes of the British Isles: a Narrative Atlas</span> (written with John Flower, 1979), <span class="italic">Charles Edward Stuart: the Life and Times of Bonnie Prince Charlie</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">Scotland and the Union</span> (1977). His father had been a connoisseur of Havana cigars; Daiches became known for his expertise in the national drink. His <span class="italic">Scotch Whisky: its Past and Present</span> (1969, 3rd rev. edn, 1978) was something of a best-seller, especially in Japan, and remained long in print. His enthusiasm could be infectious. Joel Sayre recalled that at Cornell Daiches had mentioned that Mortlach single malt was sold in New York, at Macy's: &#145;On his next trip to Manhattan he dropped in at Macy's to stock up his Mortlach supply. &#147;Sorry, but some damn fool prof up at Ithaca recommended it to his students, and we're all out&#148;&#146;  (Sayre, 6).<br>
<br>Following his retirement in 1977 Daiches moved back to Edinburgh, where he became actively involved in the cultural and intellectual life of Scotland. From 1980 until 1986 he was director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at Edinburgh University, and he played an active role in the university's summer programme and its creation. His last years were spent in his Belgrave Crescent flat, whose study was lined with books towering upwards to the high ceiling, threatening to collapse upon the frail bald dome beneath. One of the last polymaths, he was a self-confessed eclectic. The publication at eighty-one of his poems gave him great pleasure, as did the increasing recognition of his role in the rediscovery of Scottish literature. In 1981 he became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1991 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Daiches did not lack his share of personal and professional disappointments. These included his rejection by Scottish universities when he applied for positions in the post-war years, his failure to get the chair at Edinburgh he was so evidently qualified for, or a knighthood, and the death of his first wife Billie within days of their return to Edinburgh. In 1978 he married his second wife, Hazel Neville, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Newman. She died in 1986. Daiches himself died in Edinburgh on 15 July 2005. He was buried in the Jewish section of the Piershill cemetery in Edinburgh on 18 July. A well-attended celebration of his life was held on 2 October 2005 at the Playfair Library of the University of Edinburgh. He was survived by his three children, though two of them died soon after.<br>
