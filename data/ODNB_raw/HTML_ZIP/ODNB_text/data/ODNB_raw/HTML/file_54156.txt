<span class="headword">Charteris, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1346), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was perhaps distantly related to the Thomas Charteris, archdeacon of Lothian (of an Annandale family), who was chancellor from 1285 until the overlordship of Edward I was recognized on 11 June 1291, or to Sir Thomas Chartres (<i>d</i>. 1302) of Roxburghshire. He remained a layman, but served as clerk of audit in the administration of Robert I (<i>r</i>. 1306&#150;29), who gave him an annual rent of 10 merks in the Mearns (Kincardineshire), in 1324. At the end of the reign he was busy abroad making purchases for the marriage of David, the king's son, commissioning the king's tomb, and paying for the peace negotiated with England in 1328. In March 1331 he was given land at Kinfauns, Perthshire, by the crown (through Sir Andrew Murray, guardian of Scotland), possibly to reimburse his expenses in connection with the forthcoming coronation of David II.<br>
<br>From the renewal of Anglo-Scottish hostilities in 1332 no chancellor is known until April 1340, when an exchequer account claims, somewhat obscurely, that Charteris had been chancellor for the previous quinquennium, perhaps since John Randolph, earl of Moray, was made guardian in 1334. Yet from the period between 1334 and the king's return in 1341 there survive the texts of only three royal acts issued in Scotland, all of 1340&#150;41. For three years (and maybe more) before 1340 there was a keeper of the great seal, unnamed, though evidently not Charteris. The keeper, it seems, had the seal while it was out of use. Charteris may have held office then purely as a means of assuring him the chancellor's fee to remain active in the administration, but he was paid just 100 merks for five years in office because of the attenuated royal rents&#151;at the usual rate he was owed &pound;500. He was probably knighted after the king's return in 1341 and certainly between 1340 and 1342. He continued in office, and eighty-three texts of royal acts survive, issued from the chancery he directed in the years up to his death. He also sat on the exchequer audit in 1342 and 1343, the only years for which accounts are extant. Charteris accompanied David II on his invasion of England and was killed at the battle of Nevilles Cross, co. Durham, on 17 October 1346. He was probably buried that month in co. Durham.<br>
<br>The name of Charteris's wife is not known, unless she was Marjory Charteris who held a terce in Clackmannanshire in 1357&#150;8; a William Charteris, heir of Thomas (not Sir), came of age as crown tenant in the same period and sheriffdom, and has usually been seen as Sir Thomas's son and heir. Sir Thomas, whose distinction is as a lay administrator in difficult times, was the first layman to rise to the chancellorship, apparently a few years before the same thing happened in England in 1340.<br>
