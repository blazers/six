<span class="headword">Hitchcock,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1809), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was a member, with his wife, Sarah, of the company of the Theatre Royal, Norwich, from 1769 to 1771 when they both joined Tate Wilkinson's travelling company, based in York. Here they remained until 1777. Hitchcock's comedy <span class="italic">The Macaroni</span> was produced in York in 1773, and at the Haymarket Theatre later that year. It was published first by subscription in York, and then in London, Belfast, Dublin, and Philadelphia. <span class="italic">The Coquette, or, The Mistakes of the Heart</span>, his adaptation for the stage of Eliza Haywood's novel <span class="italic">The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless</span>, was first performed in Hull in 1775, and two years later was produced at the Haymarket Theatre and published in Bath.<br>
<br>The Hitchcocks performed with their son Robert (then aged only eight or nine) in Bristol and Bath in the summer of 1776, and joined the company at the Haymarket the next year. Sarah Hitchcock performed a large number of roles here, but her husband appeared much less frequently on the stage, taking up duties as prompter. His son and his daughter Mary Anne also made d&eacute;buts at the Haymarket in 1777, in Garrick's <span class="italic">Lilliput</span>. Both she and her brother Robert would be actors in their youth, but later leave the stage: Robert became a member of the Irish bar; Mary Anne married a Dublin barrister, Jonas Greene.<br>
<br>Hitchcock was the model for the character of the prompter in <span class="italic">The Manager in Distress</span> (1780) by George Colman the elder, the manager of the Haymarket. In the winter seasons, Hitchcock and his wife continued to act for Wilkinson's York company. In 1781 the family moved to Dublin to work for Richard Daly at Smock Alley, Hitchcock as prompter, his wife and daughter as actresses. In 1788 Hitchcock published <span class="italic">An Historical View of the Irish Stage; from the Earliest Period Down to 1788</span> (vol. 2 published 1794). In this year he moved with Daly to Crow Street, where he worked until his death, at 5 Clarendon Street, Dublin, in 1809  (<span class="italic">European Magazine</span>, 54, 478). His wife continued to be a successful actress, and was still performing in 1810, but the date of her death is unknown. The Hitchcocks had at least seven children, the seventh, Sarah, being born in 1781. Hitchcock's character is described in Tate Wilkinson's memoir, <span class="italic">The Wandering Patentee</span> (1795).<br>
