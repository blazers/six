<span class="headword">Cadell family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1740&#150;1934), <span class="occ">coal and ironmasters, engineers and geologists</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_57859"></a><span class="headword">William [i] Cadell</span>  (1668&#150;1728)<span class="occ"></span>, who appeared in Haddington as a journeyman glazier in 1701, and became a burgess there in 1704 by right of his father-in-law.<br>
<br>Although his origins are unknown, Cadell was an able man, and by the time of his death was a well-to-do merchant. In 1701 he married Anna (1681&#150;1743), daughter of James Hogg, a burgess of Haddington. They had three sons and one daughter, including <a name="cosubject_49056"></a><span class="headword">William [ii] Cadell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708, <em>d.</em> 1777)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized at Haddington on 10 May 1708. William [i] Cadell died at Haddington on 20 May 1728.<br>
<br>Initially a merchant like his father, by the late 1740s William [ii] Cadell was also managing collieries near Tranent in East Lothian for the York Buildings Company (responsible for running forfeited Jacobite estates). It was probably as a mine manager that he was approached by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23944/', "John Roebuck")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40491/', "Samuel Garbett")</script> when they came to establish a sulphuric acid works at Prestonpans in 1749. Roebuck and Cadell both knew Alexander &#145;Jupiter&#146; Carlyle (1722&#150;1805), and may have met through him. On 20 July 1734 Cadell married Christeen (<i>b</i>. 1703), daughter of John Hog, a shipmaster at Prestonpans. They had three sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_49057"></a><span class="headword">William [iii] Cadell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1737, <em>d.</em> 1819)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Cockenzie, East Lothian, and baptized on 16 August 1737.<br>
<br>The works were a success; so when, nearly ten years later, the two Englishmen resolved to establish a modern ironworks in Scotland, they approached Cadell again. He and his eldest son, William [iii], joined Roebuck and Garbett, and each putting in &pound;1500, provided a quarter of the founding capital of what was to become Carron Company.<br>
<br>Like his father, William [iii] Cadell was trained to the commerce of east-coast Scotland. His grand tour in 1755 took him to G&ouml;teborg, Copenhagen, and Stettin, and in 1759, when the Carron partnership was formed, he was considered able enough to be its first managing partner. The first of Carron's great furnaces went into blast on Boxing day 1760, the date which marks the start of the industrial revolution in Scotland. At the age of twenty-three, therefore, William [iii] Cadell found himself running a factory where advanced technology was allied to managerial problems of a complexity never before encountered in Scotland. By 1762 the firm employed 615 men and was thus many times the size of any other industrial undertaking in the country.<br>
<br>The Cadells were involved with the firm through the first ten exciting and precarious years of its existence, and were the only founding partners never to go bankrupt. William [iii] Cadell ceased to be manager in 1769, and went on to make a name for himself as a coal and ironmaster first at Cramond just outside Edinburgh, and then at Grange near Bo'ness. His father, William [ii] Cadell, died at Cockenzie on 31 March 1777.<br>
<br>Cramond was a group of small traditional mills on the River Almond, acquired by Carron Company, and it passed to the Cadells as part of the financial arrangements by which they extricated themselves from Carron. Until the end of the century it was a reasonably successful business. It exported a variety of goods, notably bar iron and barrel hoops to Europe and the West Indies. It was unusual as early as 1782 in having much of the mill-train and even the haft of the forge hammer made of iron, and it had the distinction of being the first ironworks in Scotland to produce steel commercially. It remained in the Cadell family until 1860. Grange was a small estate on the edge of the Forth over a good coal seam. The coal was mined profitably by the Cadells until nationalization in 1947, and the estate continued to be owned by the family.<br>
<br>William [iii] Cadell's other interests included the manufacture of high-quality paper at Auchendinny. This was a mill which had come to him through his marriage in 1773 to Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1797), daughter of Archibald Inglis of Auchendinny, with whom he had five sons and one daughter. In addition, Cadell became a founder partner in the Muirkirk and Clyde ironworks, both of which, like Carron, were still functioning in the twentieth century. By the end of his life Cadell had limited his interests to Cramond and Grange, but was characteristic of those simple hard-working merchants who wanted only to turn an honest penny, and on whose enterprise the early industrial development of Scotland was founded. William [iii] Cadell died on 17 September 1819.<br>
<br>William's younger brother <a name="cosubject_49058"></a><span class="headword">John Cadell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1740, <em>d.</em> 1814)<span class="occ"></span> was a mine owner at Tranent. Baptized at Cockenzie on 2 May 1740, in 1772 he married Marie (1753&#150;1841), daughter of John Buchan of Letham, East Lothian; they had eight sons and four daughters. John Cadell had the melancholy distinction of being the magistrate responsible for giving the orders to the militia that led to the &#145;massacre of Tranent&#146; in 1797, at which eleven men were killed during a riot in protest against the <span class="roman">Militia Act</span>. He died at Cockenzie on 20 January 1814. Among John's sons, William [iv] Cadell (1773&#150;1840) was briefly employed at Cramond before becoming treasurer of the Bank of Scotland, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4301/', "Robert Cadell (1788&#150;1849)")</script> was Sir Walter Scott's publisher.<br>
<br>William [iii] Cadell's sons included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4304/', "William Archibald Cadell (1775&#150;1855)")</script>, traveller, mathematician, and friend of Sir Joseph Banks. Later significant members of the family included William's grandson <a name="cosubject_57860"></a><span class="headword">Henry Cadell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1812, <em>d.</em> 1888)<span class="occ"></span>, a distinguished mining engineer. He was baptized on 21 May 1812 at Grange, Bo'ness, the son of James John Cadell and his wife, Isabella, daughter of Henry Moubray of Calderbank. He was one of the earliest to study and exploit the silting propensities of the Firth of Forth, and his purchase in 1868 of 86 acres of foreshore, which he started to reclaim by a process of silting and the use of pit waste, added considerably to the industrial possibilities of the area. A notable inventor, he also exhibited weighing equipment at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Henry Cadell married Martha (<i>d</i>. 1854), daughter of Robert Hislop, in 1841, and they had two sons and three daughters. He married again in 1859, his second wife being Jessie Gray (<i>d</i>. 1895), daughter of the Revd John McFarlane. There were a further four sons and three daughters from this marriage. Henry Cadell died at Grange on 8 January 1888.<br>
<br>Henry's son <a name="cosubject_57861"></a><span class="headword">Henry Moubray Cadell</span>  (1860&#150;1934), a <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was one of the earliest members of the geological survey of Scotland under Professor Archibald Geikie. Born on 30 May 1860 at Crawhill, Torphichen, West Lothian, he was the eldest child of Henry Cadell and his second wife, Jessie. He studied at Edinburgh University from 1876 to 1882, and then at the renowned mining school at Clausthal in Germany from 1882 to 1883. His discovery of the great thrust planes of Sutherland, his work on the shale fields of West Lothian, and his two major books, <span class="italic">The Story of the Forth</span> (1913) and <span class="italic">The Rocks of West Lothian</span> (1918), were pioneering studies. Henry Moubray Cadell married Elinor (1868&#150;1945), daughter of David Simson of Bonaly, in 1889; they had one son and seven daughters. He died at Edinburgh on 10 April 1934.<br>
<br>Through their ironworks and collieries the Cadell family played a key role in inaugurating the industrial revolution in Scotland. During the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries they continued to contribute to Scottish industrial and technological development, and, although no longer directly involved in manufacturing, members of the family still occupied the land first acquired for industrial purposes in the eighteenth century.<br>
