<span class="headword">Tanner,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1743, <em>d.</em> in or after 1805), <span class="occ">ironmaster</span>, was baptized on 27 December 1743 at St Mary's parish church, Monmouth. He was the fourth child of David Tanner (1702&#150;1754), ironmaster, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1797), the daughter of Walter Davis of Mitcheltroy, Monmouthshire. The three eldest children died at an early age and David's birth was followed by that of three other children. The youngest, William (1754&#150;1806), became a junior partner in some of David's enterprises. Their grandfather was a cooper and then a timber merchant. Tanner's father died when he was eleven and he was brought up by his mother and her brother, the Revd Dr John Davis (1721&#150;1798), vicar of Monmouth. As a young adult Tanner became involved in local politics. He became a burgessman and a member of the common council of Monmouth. Elected mayor in 1782, in 1792 he was appointed sheriff of Monmouthshire. Monmouth, situated on the navigable River Wye, was just upriver from the charcoal furnaces at Redbrook and Tintern and was in close proximity to long-established charcoal ironmaking centres in south Wales, the Forest of Dean, and Herefordshire. It was from around Monmouth in 1769 that Tanner, at the age of twenty-six, obtained the right to extract iron cinder which could be sold to local ironworks for resmelting. This was the start of a self-made industrial career that was to earn him the reputation of being the last of the great charcoal ironmasters.<br>
<br>In south Wales large amounts of money were being spent on mineral leases and on the construction of large coke-fired furnaces. Tanner did not have this level of finance. Initially he and his mother obtained money by acquiring land and then mortgaging it. This was a strategy that he continued to employ by himself throughout his career. He concentrated on obtaining leases of charcoal furnaces that could be had relatively cheaply and required very little capital investment. Although they were smaller and less than half as productive as the average newly erected coke-fired furnaces in south Wales, Tanner was able to partly compensate for this by importing large amounts of haematite from Cumberland to some of his furnaces. The haematite contained up to twice the content of iron as local ores and produced iron that he could sell at a premium. Because the quality of local outcrop coal to be found in the Forest of Dean was too poor to use in coke-fuelled furnaces, and the supply of wood from the forest was readily available, there was little incentive for Tanner to invest in coke-fuelled furnaces. Tanner leased his first furnace at Tintern in 1772. A few months later, he leased the Ynysgedwyn Furnace, situated 60 miles away, at the head of the Swansea valley. He also worked in the Forest of Dean and at various times leased Lydney Furnace and its two forges, Rowley, Clanna, and Barnedge forges, Redbrook Furnace, and Lydbrook Upper and Middle forges.<br>
<br>In 1784 Tanner leased a foundry at Cyfarthfa, Merthyr Tudful, which he relinquished to Richard Crawshay in 1786 to concentrate on his acquisitions from Jane, the widow of John Hanbury of Pontypool. This was composed of the lease of the furnace, tinworks, and forges at Pontypool, the furnace at Llanelli (Brecknockshire), and a forge at Caerleon. The lease was to run from 2 February 1786 to 2 February 1797, during the minority of her oldest son. Tanner paid the first instalment of the lease but refused to pay further instalments until he could finance them from profits. Jane Hanbury retaliated by denying that a formal lease had ever existed and tried to recover her property. A long case ensued in chancery that was effectively won by Tanner. During his period at Pontypool, Tanner erected two coke-fired blast furnaces on freehold land at Blaendare, partly to pressurize Jane Hanbury into dropping her case against him. In addition to iron, tin, and wire, Tanner manufactured cannon for a period of at least ten years. This chiefly took place at Tintern, as well as for a short period at Cyfarthfa; but most of his cannon failed Board of Ordnance quality standards.<br>
<br>By 1796 Tanner was experiencing serious financial difficulties. He was tricked by two local solicitors into appearing to commit an act of bankruptcy and was declared bankrupt in November 1798. He and his brother William were committed to the king's bench prison. Tanner's proven debts of &pound;85,000 may well have actually exceeded &pound;100,000, which would have made him one of the largest known bankrupts outside London up to that time. In December 1799, before Lord Kenyon and a special jury, Tanner was found not to have committed an act of bankruptcy but the bankruptcy commission was not rescinded. This was probably because many of his assets had already been disposed of and, since he had lost his manufacturing base, he would have been financially incapable of continuing his operations. In August 1801 Tanner left to join his friend Harford Jones (later Sir Harford Jones Brydges), the East India Company's resident at Baghdad. He was accompanied by his son John, who remained at Basrah. Tanner set out for India in March 1803 and proceeded to Bengal in May. No report of Tanner's death has been found in India and it is not known when he died. He seems to have returned, as it was reported at Bath in 1805 that he had been found wandering shoeless and starving.<br>
