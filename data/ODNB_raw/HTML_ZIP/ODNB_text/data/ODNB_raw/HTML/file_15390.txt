<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Rann</span>  (1772&#150;1851), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and poet</span>, was the son of Benjamin Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1784), surgeon, and his wife, the daughter of Illedge Maddox. He was of Scottish origin, being descended from a branch of the Ayrshire Kennedys, who settled at Shenstone, Staffordshire, early in the eighteenth century. His father went about 1773 to America, to introduce inoculation, and settled at Annapolis in Maryland with his family, where they remained during and after the American War of Independence. On his father's death in 1784, Rann returned with his mother, who was of Welsh descent, to her family's estate at Withington, near Shrewsbury, where he was brought up.<br>
<br>In 1791 Kennedy went to St John's College, Cambridge, where he formed a lasting friendship with S. T. Coleridge. After obtaining his degree (BA 1795 and MA 1798) he took holy orders, and accepted a mastership at King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he became second master in 1807. From 1797 to 1817 he was also curate of St Paul's, Birmingham, and from 1817 until about 1847 was its incumbent, his congregation having purchased for him the next presentation.<br>
<br>In 1802 Kennedy had married Julia, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11973/', "John Hall (1739&#150;1797)")</script>, historical engraver, and Mary de Gilles, a French Huguenot. Their four sons also had distinguished and successful careers at Cambridge and beyond. All won the Porson prize while at university, and the three elder were senior classics (1827, 1831, and 1834). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15363/', "Benjamin Hall Kennedy (1804&#150;1889)")</script> eventually became the regius professor of Greek at Cambridge, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15364/', "Charles Rann Kennedy (1808&#150;1867)")</script> was a lawyer and a classical scholar. A third son, George John (<i>d</i>. 1847), was to become master at Rugby, while the fourth son, William James (1814&#150;1891), was to serve as first secretary of the National Society for the Promotion of Education, as HM inspector of schools (1848&#150;78), and as vicar of Barnwood, Gloucestershire.<br>
<br>Kennedy was earnest and enthusiastic, and a determined enemy of intolerance and bigotry. He was considered to be &#145;one of the best classical scholars of his time&#146;  (Trott, 47), and also published several poetical works, including <span class="italic">A Church of England Psalmbook</span> (1821), and its companion piece, <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Music and Words of Psalmody as at Present in use among the Members of the Church of England</span> (1821). He had a great many friends in intellectual circles, chief among them being John Johnstone MD and Samuel Parr, but he also associated with Coleridge, Washington Irving, Wordsworth, James Montgomery, Henry Francis Cary, Charles Kemble, and Sarah Siddons. A poem which he published in 1817 on the death of the Princess Charlotte received the highest praise from Washington Irving, who quotes from it in his &#145;Sketch-book&#146;. Irving described Kennedy as &#145;a most eccentric character&#146; and &#145;a man of real genius &hellip; one of the queerest mortals living&#146;  (Trott, 47).<br>
<br>Kennedy inherited a small property called the Fox Hollies, near Birmingham, from his cousin John Kennedy, and in March 1835 he retired from his mastership at King Edward's School. Kennedy assisted his son Charles in a translation of Virgil, published in 1849. Several of his poems were published in his sons' volumes, including the much praised lyrical poem &#145;The Reign of Youth&#146; (1840; reprinted in B. H. Kennedy's <span class="italic">Between Whiles</span>, 2nd edn 1882). He died at Charles's home, 34 St Paul's Square, Birmingham, on 3 January 1851.<br>
