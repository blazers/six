<span class="headword">Chaplin,  William James</span>  (1787&#150;1859), <span class="occ">transport entrepreneur</span>, was born at Rochester, Kent, the son of William Chaplin, a coach proprietor on the Dover road, and his wife, Eleanor. Chaplin was educated at Bromley, and on 11 July 1816 married Elizabeth Alston at St Nicholas, Rochester. They had at least fourteen children.<br>
<br>About 1823 Chaplin succeeded William Waterhouse at the Swan with Two Necks inn, Lad Lane, London, and he was to become the largest ever coach proprietor. In 1827 his coach business employed 300 to 400 horses; by 1835 this had risen to 1200. As well as three London inns, he had extensive stables at Purley, Hounslow, and Whetstone, and was said to employ 2000 people. In 1836 he had ninety-two coaches leaving London every day, serving all the main roads from the city. He horsed fourteen of the twenty-seven mail coaches leaving London each night. His annual turnover was said to be &pound;500,000.<br>
<br>According to one of his former coachmen, &#145;Downright industry, and a systematic application to business, in which the female members of the family were called to assist, formed the foundation of his elevation&#146;; he had excellent knowledge of both horses and men, and &#145;an intellect superior to most of his class in shrewdness and tact, and this with a soft, oily expression, that procured for him the soubriquet of &#147;Bite 'em sly&#148;&#146;  (Cross, 113&#150;14). Harris, writing in 1885, stated that he had never heard any of Chaplin's former coachmen or guards speak ill of him. He resided at a hotel he owned in the Adelphi.<br>
<br>Chaplin correctly perceived the likely effect of railways on coaching, and adapted to the change with great skill. About 1838 he sold most of his coaches and horses, left the proceeds on deposit, and went to Switzerland for six weeks to contemplate his future, ensuring that no business communications could reach him. On his return he invested a large sum in the London and Southampton Railway (later the London and South Western Railway, or LSWR), eventually totalling &pound;250,000. By 1840 he was vice-chairman and in 1843&#150;52 and 1854&#150;8 chairman, guiding the company through its formative years. Also, with another coach proprietor, Benjamin Horne, he established the railway carrying firm of Chaplin and Horne, which in 1840 became agent to the Grand Junction Railway, and from 1847 shared an exclusive goods and parcels agency with Pickfords on that railway's successor, the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Chaplin retained a share in this until his death.<br>
<br>In 1849 it was claimed that Chaplin's position in Chaplin and Horne was incompatible with his chairmanship of the LSWR, and he had to defend himself against charges of &#145;dishonest and corrupt conduct&#146;  (Fay, 71&#150;2). The investigating committee found that &#145;wrong as many transactions decidedly were, Mr Chaplin made the interests and prosperity of the Company his first object, and from a long and constant connection, considered his own affairs identified with those of the South Western&#146;  (ibid.). Chaplin's support for a central route to Exeter via Salisbury, as opposed to a coastal route, caused him to resign as chairman in 1852, but he returned to that office in 1854 and it was the central line which was built.<br>
<br>Chaplin was also a director of the Paris and Rouen, Rouen and Havre, and Rhenish railways, and was involved in a cross-channel steamship company, which were together intended to form part of a direct link between London and the continent. He was MP for Salisbury from 1847 until 1857, though he appears to have been largely silent in the house. He was described as &#145;an advanced Liberal and an active supporter of Reform measures&#146;  (<span class="italic">City Press</span>, 30 April 1859, 2). He was also sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1845&#150;6 and deputy lieutenant of Hampshire in 1856. In later years he had residences at 2 Hyde Park Gardens, London, and Ewhurst Park, Basingstoke. Ill-health forced him to resign his seat on the LSWR board in 1858, and he died on 24 April 1859 at 2 Hyde Park Gardens, London.<br>
