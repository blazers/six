<span class="headword">Moore, Sir  Henry Monck-Mason</span>  (1887&#150;1964), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born in Wimbledon on 16 March 1887, the youngest of the seven children of the Revd Edward W. Moore and his wife, Laetitia M. Monck-Mason. As a youth Moore, who was affectionately known to his friends as Monkey, attended Rokeby preparatory school, King's College School in Wimbledon, and then received Rustat and Skinner scholarships to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was awarded the BA degree in 1909 in classics. After failing the Indian Civil Service examination, Moore obtained an eastern cadetship in the Ceylon civil service. In November 1910 he arrived in Ceylon and was attached to the secretariat and then to the Colombo <i>kachcheri</i>. During his years in Ceylon he served in a variety of positions in Colombo, Negombo, and Avisawela. In 1914 he received a promotion to fourth assistant colonial secretary.<br>
<br>During the First World War Moore, who had initially enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery as a gunner and driver, held a temporary commission in Royal Garrison Artillery. He served in the Salonika campaign and the British expeditionary force. In August 1919 he returned to Ceylon and became assistant colonial secretary. The following year he worked as the private secretary to the governor. In December 1921 he married Daphne Ione Viola, the only daughter of W. J. Benson, who was in the consular service; the couple had two daughters. Moore became colonial secretary in Bermuda in 1922. Two years later he became principal assistant secretary in the Lagos secretariat, Nigeria, and in 1927 was promoted to deputy chief secretary. During his tenure in Lagos he served as secretary to two committees for Northern and Southern Nigeria.<br>
<br>In 1929 Moore went to Kenya to assume the post of colonial secretary. At that time the colony was in the throes of a political crisis because its Indian population was struggling for equality and demanding to be placed on a common roll with the European settlers instead of on an Indian communal roll. As colonial secretary Moore served as the leader of the official majority in the legislative council and repeatedly conducted negotiations with representatives from the Indian and European settler communities. Additionally, in 1930, he served as the colony's acting governor.<br>
<br>In 1934 Moore became governor and commander-in-chief of Sierra Leone. Among other achievements, he facilitated the protectorate's social and economic development, ended forced labour, built roads, improved medical and sanitary facilities, and introduced African administration. He served a tour in 1937&#150;40 as assistant and then deputy under-secretary of state at the Colonial Office. Initially he was in charge of the West Indian and Far Eastern departments and the economic section. Additionally, he was the Colonial Office's representative on committees investigating civil aviation and oil distribution.<br>
<br>In January 1940 Moore succeeded Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham as governor of Kenya. During his tenure he allowed the European settlers to make considerable political and economic gains. In 1942 he became chairman of the east African supply and defence council, which co-ordinated the defences of Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. More importantly, his common-sense wartime leadership enabled Kenya to enlarge its military establishment, participate in the allied victories in Ethiopia and British and Italian Somaliland, and deploy King's African rifles units to north Africa, Madagascar, and south-east Asia. His wife served as chair of the joint Red Cross and St John committee and as president of Kenya's Women's Emergency Organisation.<br>
<br>After leaving Kenya, Moore served as governor of Ceylon from 1944 to 1948. In this position he facilitated the decolonization process and the emergence of an independent Ceylon &#145;in an atmosphere of general peace and good will&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 March 1964). He co-operated closely with D. S. Senanayake, the Ceylonese leader; and he in particular facilitated the implementation of the Soulbury constitution, which provided for a two-chamber parliament and for full internal self-government. He also served as Ceylon's first governor-general in 1948&#150;9 under the new order.<br>
<br>Although not as well remembered as some colonial governors, Moore nevertheless made significant contributions in several of the countries in which he served. In Sierra Leone, for example, he helped to lay the foundation of a more extensive administrative system, which previously had been centred primarily in the capital, Freetown, and had extended no further than a small group of minor chiefs. During his wartime service in Kenya, Moore proscribed the Kikuyu Central Association, a nationalist group led by Jomo Kenyatta, and gaoled many of its leaders. This was a politically unpopular step, especially with much of the Kikuyu community which was seeking to expand the political role of Africans, but one that Moore deemed necessary because of the ongoing military campaign in neighbouring Ethiopia. However, his most enduring legacy was his success in engineering a peaceful transition to independence in Ceylon.<br>
<br>In recognition of his numerous contributions Moore received many awards, the most significant of which included appointments as CMG in 1930, KCMG in 1935, and GCMG in 1943. He also received an honorary LLD degree from the University of Ceylon. In 1949 Moore, who had been suffering from arthritis, retired to Cape Town, South Africa. He died on 26 March 1964 at the Volkshospital, Hof Street Gardens, Cape Town, South Africa. Lady Moore survived him. His <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist described Moore as &#145;a first-class administrator, with a tidy mind and a fund of common sense&#146;  (28 March 1964).<br>
