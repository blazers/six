<span class="headword">Martyn,  Benjamin</span>  (1698&#150;1763), <span class="occ">writer and government official</span>, born on 8 September 1698, was the eldest son of Richard Martyn (1667&#150;1715?), commissioner of stamp duties and linen draper of London, and nephew of Edward Martyn, professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, and of Henry Martin, the economist. Their forebears were of Aldbourne, Wiltshire. Benjamin was educated at the Charterhouse School (1709&#150;14), and bound apprentice to his father on 10 July 1714. Soon afterwards the father went to Buenos Aires as agent for the South Sea Company, and died there; his <span class="italic">Relation</span> of the voyage thither and expedition to Potosi was published in London in 1716. Benjamin became an examiner of the outport books in the London custom house, probably by favour of his uncle Henry, who was inspector-general of the exports and imports.<br>
<br>Martyn wrote a tragedy, <span class="italic">Timoleon</span>, which was rejected by the Drury Lane management until resubmitted &#145;with a Command which they durst not disobey&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 29 Jan 1730). Martyn's play was disparaged in <span class="italic">Remarks on Timoleon</span> by Philomusas, and ridiculed in James Miller's <span class="italic">Harlequin&#150;Horace</span> and John Lloyd's <span class="italic">The Play; a Satire</span>, but ran successfully for fourteen nights in January and February 1730, and was revived occasionally later. Such fame as it had was owing to a ghost scene which echoes <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> and <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. The printed play was dedicated to George II.<br>
<br>The patron who helped Martyn in the staging and dedication of <span class="italic">Timoleon</span> has not been identified, but it was Alderman George Heathcote, a wealthy West India merchant and opposition whig MP, who recommended him in July 1732 for the post of secretary to the board of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95206', "trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America")</script>, describing him as &#145;a very ingenious young man&#146; who &#145;has some employment under the Government, and is a sober young man, who out of his little maintains his mother and sisters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.286). Martyn acted gratis at first, but was receiving &pound;50 a half-year by the end of 1733 and &pound;75 by 1737; he also kept his examinership, worth &pound;100 p.a., in the custom house. In 1734 he displeased some of the Georgia trustees by inviting the suspected deist Thomas Rundle (1688&#150;1743) to preach before them: it was also said that Martyn had &#145;too little regard to the religious part&#146; of the council's designs in Georgia, and that he was politicking on his own account  (ibid., 2.23&#150;4, 41, 44); but Martyn retained his position.<br>
<br>As well as conducting official correspondence Martyn publicized Georgia in pamphlets, the most substantial of which are <span class="italic">A New and Accurate Account of &hellip; Georgia</span> (1732) (sometimes wrongly attributed to James Oglethorpe, the prime mover of the Georgia project), <span class="italic">Reasons for Establishing the Colony of Georgia</span> (1733), <span class="italic">An Impartial Enquiry into the State and Utility of &hellip; Georgia</span> (1741), and <span class="italic">An Account Showing the Progress of &hellip; Georgia</span> (1742). This last was a vindication of the Oglethorpe administration against a hostile pamphlet by colonial malcontents, though Martyn knew far less about Georgia than his opponents did. Martyn is perhaps the seated figure with pen and paper in hand in the centre foreground of Willem Verelst's conversation piece <span class="italic">The Common Council of Georgia Receiving the Indian Chiefs</span> (painted in London in 1734&#150;5, now in the H. F. Dupont Museum, Winterthur, Delaware, USA). On 20 December 1752 Martyn was recommended for the profitable post of agent for Georgia.<br>
<br>In May 1736 Martyn was a committee member of the Society for the Encouragement of Learning, as was his friend Thomas Birch (1705&#150;1766): their correspondence, 1737&#150;62, is in British Library Add. MS 4313. According to his tombstone Martyn was &#145;the first promoter&#146; of the Shakespeare monument in Westminster Abbey. Other contemporary references to this project (such as periodicals and George Vertue's notebooks) do not mention Martyn, but he wrote a special prologue for a performance of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span> at Drury Lane on 28 April 1738 to raise money for the monument.<br>
<br>At some time in the 1730s the fourth earl of Shaftesbury, one of the Georgia trustees, commissioned Martyn to write a life of the first earl from family papers. The work, unfinished at Martyn's death in 1763, was revised in turn by Gregory Sharpe and Andrew Kippis and printed privately about 1790 (nearly twenty years after the fourth earl's death). The fifth earl disapproved, so most of this impression was destroyed, but a copy which escaped was edited and published in 1836 by George Wingrove Cooke.<br>
<br>In the last decade of his life Martyn suffered from gout; he died unmarried at Eltham, Kent, on 25 October 1763, and was buried in Lewisham churchyard on 31 October. By his will, proved on 27 October 1763, he bequeathed nearly &pound;4000 to relatives; works of art in his New Bond Street lodgings (collected during tours on the continent) were bequeathed to friends.<br>
