<span class="headword">Eyre <span class="st"> [Eyres, Ayres]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1634&#150;1675), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and Leveller</span>, is of obscure origins; the place and date of his birth and the names of his parents are not known. His rank of captain in a cavalry regiment during the first civil war suggests that he may have come from the rural middling sort. In his <span class="italic">The Serious Representation</span> (1649), he stated that, &#145;fifteen years ago, I was forc'd to leave this my Native Land, for opposing the <i>Service Book</i>, and other <i>Traditions of men</i>, and lived in <i>New-England</i> till the sitting of the last Parliament&#146;  (Eyre, <span class="italic">Serious Representation</span>, 1&#150;2).<br>
<br>In 1642 Eyre became a sergeant in Denzil Holles's regiment, and was engaged at Edgehill and at Brentford, where the regiment was destroyed. Eyre joined the army of the eastern association, and was commissioned by Oliver Cromwell quartermaster in his own troop, and soon promoted captain of the sixth troop in Cromwell's cavalry regiment, the Ironsides. Eyre participated in Cromwell's campaign in Lincolnshire until January 1644, when his troop and two others were captured at Sleaford. By his own later account in <span class="italic">The Serious Representation</span>, written with the hindsight of a Leveller prisoner in Oxford Castle, he fell out with Cromwell and left the regiment in the summer &#145;for standing to my first Principles&#146;. Cromwell, he added,<blockquote>would often (when he was low) stroke me on the head, saying, <i>The Nation was bound to bless God for me</i>: But when he saw the Country and Souldiery respect me, he and his Creatures studied how to make me odious in the sight of all honest men. (Eyre, <span class="italic">Serious Representation</span>, 3)</blockquote>In 1647 Eyre married Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Leycester, widow successively of Calcott Chambre (or Culvert Chambers) and of Job Ward. Her first husband's father had bought the half-barony of Shillelagh and Carnew Castle in co. Wicklow, and through his marriage Eyre now acquired a right to this property. Henceforth the relief of Ireland was central to his hopes. Parliament authorized a force for that purpose, directing Sir Thomas Fairfax to nominate the officers, and Eyre was named colonel of a foot regiment to be so raised.<br>
<br>Eyre's regiment was not part of the New Model Army. Nevertheless he was at Corkbush Field, near Ware, in Hertfordshire, on 15 November 1647 for the New Model's mutinous rendezvous, inciting the soldiers and urging them to accept the Leveller <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>. Immediately arrested, he was held pending court martial with William Bray, captain-lieutenant of the regiment of Robert Lilburne which had been so prominent in the mutiny. Hailed as a martyr by the Levellers, Eyre (with eight fellow prisoners) submitted an inflammatory petition clearing the Levellers from an unfounded aspersion made by Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Lilburne of a plot to kill the king. The court martial was convened at Windsor on 3 December and ordinary soldiers among the accused were soon sentenced and punished, but Eyre's trial was postponed. He remained in custody until 23 December, when he was among those allowed to return to their regiments without any further punishment upon acknowledgement and submission to military discipline.<br>
<br>Eyre's regiment was then quartered in Worcestershire, where, with several others, it was scheduled for disbandment as a &#145;supernumerary&#146; force. Eyre was absent while he lobbied for his men's pay and arrears. In January 1648 about eighty officers representing five regiments (including Eyre's) met at Broadway in Gloucestershire to discuss their discontents, following which they planned to seize Gloucester. In February orders were issued for the regiment's immediate disbandment.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1648 Henry Marten, a member of the Berkshire county committee, began to raise local forces in Berkshire, proclaiming Leveller and egalitarian principles. Joined by Eyre these irregulars terrorized the county. The Commons summoned Marten and Eyre and ordered the Berkshire committee to disband their forces. Both Eyre and Marten left Berkshire and sought protection with Cromwell.<br>
<br>Eyre still wished to serve in Ireland. &#145;I had three troops that were willing to have engaged in that service, and L[ieutenant&#150;]G[eneral] Cromwel gave me orders to quarter them&#146;  (Eyre, <span class="italic">Serious Representation</span>, 3). But in February 1649 Fairfax, the lord general, issued a declaration against taking quarters without his commission. Fairfax ordered Eyre to a council of war for quartering troops without sanction, &#145;and then L. G. Cromwell did deny that he gave me any order to do it, and likewise tore his own order in peeces&#146;  (ibid., 4). The three troops were ordered to be disbanded. Eyre was now a civilian.<br>
<br>In May 1649 Eyre took part in the Leveller-influenced Burford mutiny; his account in <span class="italic">The Serious Representation</span> agrees generally with the newsbook accounts. Hearing of the regiments that were refusing to take service in Ireland on the terms of compulsion imposed on them by the generals, he searched them out, conferred with Cornet Henry Denne of Scrope's regiment, and accompanied the mutineers to New Bridge on the Thames, where they faced Colonel John Reynolds who kept the bridge. Eyre exhorted the mutineers to attack, but rather than leading a forlorn hope against Reynolds, Eyre reports that the men, &#145;unwilling to draw their swords against their fellow souldiers, marched over the River a little above the bridg&#146;, Eyre himself &#145;having no Command, nor being under any&#146;  (Eyre, <span class="italic">Serious Representation</span>, 5). At Burford Fairfax's men &#145;fell upon shooting in at every window where they saw light&#146;, and seized Eyre at an inn where he was lodging  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Eyre again appeared before Fairfax and Cromwell and justified his presence at Burford. &#145;I was a Volunteer at the first, and I hoped I might be so still, and till that which we fought for were accomplished, if there were but ten men appeared for it, I would make eleven&#146;  (Eyre, <span class="italic">Serious Representation</span>, 6). Cromwell railed at him and three days later he was brought to Oxford prison.<br>
<br>In July the council of state, fearful of conspiracies hatching in Oxford, directed that Eyre be removed to Warwick Castle, where he spent the next year. Finally his spirit broke, and in a petition to the council he admitted that he had been misguided and mistaken as to the good purpose of others, and begged that he might go with his family to Ireland. The council ordered his release on 1 August 1650.<br>
<br>In Ireland the lord deputy, Henry Ireton, put Eyre in possession of Shillelagh. His victory was short-lived. In 1654 he was back in London and involved in a new Leveller plot, conspiring with old prison companions against the protectorate and complaining, as a witness reported, &#145;that it was as good living in Turky as here&#146;  (Thurloe, 3.35). In January 1655 he was arrested upon landing in Dublin. In his examination he asserted that it was his duty to &#145;make good&#146; the principles of the army's engagement at Triploe Heath&#151;a reference to the army's espousal of its solemn engagement in the summer of 1647  (ibid.). While he loved and honoured the protector, even the best of men were subject to corruption.<br>
<br>After eleven weeks, &#145;very much distempered both in body and mind&#146;, Eyre begged either to be tried or else permitted to join Robert Venables's expedition, then at Hispaniola. His appeal was fruitless, and he remained in gaol. Meanwhile a number of suits were entered against his claim to Shillelagh. He was released briefly in 1659, but was arrested again in May 1660 as one of a group of &#145;rebellious spirits&#146; who threatened the peace of the restored monarchy. Imprisoned in Dublin Castle, he was charged with tampering with members of the Irish foot guards garrisoning the castle, employing a soldier to act as his agent in trying to foment mutiny. However, he was not brought to trial because the only witness, the soldier, was unclear as to the treasonable design. The earl of Clarendon advised that if there were &#145;a morall satisfaction of the truth of the charge&#146;, Ormond might secure Eyre in another prison. In Eyre's words, he was &#145;hurried (from prison to prison) above ten years space&#146;  (Eyre, <span class="italic">William Eyres</span>, 22). His wife died while he was in prison. About December 1669 he was at last released and, accompanied by his daughter, travelled to England to pursue the case for his Irish estates before parliament and the king. In 1675 he published two appeals, <span class="italic">The Case of William Eyres, Esq.</span> and <span class="italic">A Particular Deduction of the Case of William Eyre</span>. The former was referred by the House of Lords to its committee of privileges in May 1675 upon the complaint of the second earl of Strafford that its claims had libelled both himself and his father, though what action the committee took is not recorded. Eyre's subsequent history and the date of his death are unknown.<br>
<br>Eyre has sometimes been confused with his namesake <a name="cosubject_70167"></a><span class="headword">William Eyre</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1642&#150;1660), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, of Neston, Wiltshire. He fought during the civil war&#151;in 1659 he claimed to have served through to the battle of Worcester and to have held the ranks from captain of foot to colonel (the latter probably a reference to his rank in the Wiltshire militia). He was returned MP for Chippenham in that county on 29 November 1648, thereby missing Pride's Purge, and was admitted to the Rump Parliament on 15 January 1649. In January 1660 the restored Rump appointed him colonel of the regiment of foot recently commanded by John Lambert though a suspicious George Monck quickly removed him from its command.<br>
