<span class="headword">Shillitoe,  Thomas</span>  (1754&#150;1836), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born at Gray's Inn, Holborn, London, on 24 February 1754, the fourth of the six children of Richard Shillito (<i>d</i>. in or after 1779), librarian, and Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benson (<i>d</i>. in or after 1779). Richard Shillito had in 1750 been appointed librarian of Gray's Inn but shortly after Thomas's birth the family moved to Whitechapel, and in 1766 they took the Three Tuns inn at Islington, where Thomas acted as potboy. He was then apprenticed to a grocer and was for a time at Portsmouth, whence he returned to London in the early 1770s. His upbringing was in the established church, and after his return to London he accompanied his master to the Foundling Hospital chapel for about three years until he met, and enjoyed the company of, a distant relative &#145;descended from Friends&#146;. Thomas now started to go with him to Friends' meetings but, the relative being far from strict, they spent the rest of the day convivially at fashionable places of resort. After about a year Thomas, now more decided in his Quaker convictions, abandoned frivolity for the afternoon meeting for worship. He joined the Friends (despite the &#145;great displeasure&#146; of his father) about 1775. His sister Margaret (1748&#150;1795) was travelling a similar spiritual path and became a member of the Society of Friends in December 1776.<br>
<br>Shillitoe was helped to a situation with a Quaker banking firm in Lombard Street (not necessarily Barclays, as Hine asserts). Shocked, however, that, contrary to Friends' principles, the firm handled lottery tickets, he left it in 1778 and learned the trade of a shoemaker, the occupation of his future wife's father. London did not suit his health and he moved that year to Tottenham. On 13 July 1779 he married Mary (1746&#150;1838), daughter of John Pace and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jeynes, of Spitalfields; the couple had three sons and four daughters, of whom one son and one daughter died in infancy. Shillitoe's sister Margaret married in 1786 John Sanderson (1749?&#150;1816), a London tallow chandler; their daughters married into established Quaker dynasties&#151;Mary (1788&#150;1846) in 1821 to Sylvanus Fox (1791&#150;1851) of the woollen manufacturing concern at Wellington, Somerset, and Elizabeth (1793&#150;1901) in 1826 to Cornelius Hanbury (1796&#150;1869), partner in the firm of Allen and Hanbury.<br>
<br>Before he left London, Shillitoe had begun to speak in Friends' meetings, and his gift in the vocal ministry was acknowledged by Tottenham monthly meeting in 1790. By 1806, having made sufficient money to ensure an annual income of &pound;100, he retired from business and devoted himself to his Quaker and philanthropic interests. Thereafter he travelled almost continually throughout Britain, in Ireland (three visits, 1808&#150;11), on the continent of Europe (1821&#150;3, 1824&#150;5), and in North America (1826&#150;30). In 1812 he and his wife (with their daughter Hannah) moved to Barnsley, Yorkshire, to be near their recently widowed daughter Mary, and in 1819 they settled in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, where their daughter Margaret (1784&#150;1847) and her husband, John Whiting (1776&#150;1853), lived. In 1826 Shillitoe's wife returned to Tottenham, where he joined her on his return from America.<br>
<br>About the mid-1780s Shillitoe had become a teetotaller and a vegetarian. Though nervously preoccupied about his health he was in fact physically tough, often walking 30 miles a day; even at eighty he would walk from the City back home to Tottenham. James Everett, a Hitchin Methodist, depicted him:<blockquote>he was below the middle height, spare, active, buoyant in spirit, and appeared as if made of wire and muscle. He was generally attired in a &#145;pepper and salt&#146; suit, with a dowlas shirt often open at the neck, and a chip hat, which he usually carried in his hand, or on his umbrella stick in hot weather. He walked vigorously, often with his coat over his arm. (Hine, 187)</blockquote>Despite nervous fears (he would run across London Bridge in dread lest it collapse beneath him) he had indomitable moral courage once he was convinced he was doing God's requirings. Thus in Ireland, usually with other Friends, he systematically visited drinking houses (eighty in Waterford alone), speaking with the keepers and also frequently &#145;to the company sitting in them to drink, who mostly heard quietly what we had to offer and at our parting behaved respectfully&#146;  (Shillitoe, 1.91). At the other end of the social scale his 1824 continental visit included &#145;religious opportunities&#146; with the duke of Cumberland at Hanover, the crown prince of Prussia at Berlin, the king of Prussia at Charlottenburg, the king of Denmark at Copenhagen, and the emperor Alexander I at Petersburg. Back at home he had more than one interview with George IV. He passed by sentries into palaces and by warders into prisons and seemed intuitively to respond to the needs of those to whom he felt called.<br>
<br>Shillitoe's religious temperament was mystical but his theology was orthodox. During his American visit, smelling infidelity in the followers of Elias Hicks, he was more preoccupied in preaching against them than in listening to what they actually said. Thus, though sincere in wanting to promote unity among American Quakers, his visits may well have hastened the disastrous separations of 1827&#150;8. During the 1830s, however, he was alarmed at the increasing emphasis that some British Friends were placing on the scriptures rather than the spirit as a primary rule. His quiet humour remained until the end. He said to his medical attendant: &#145;I will take any thing in moderation, that will not affect my intellect. I want to go out of the world with a clear head and a clean heart&#146;  (Shillitoe, 2.425). He died on 12 June 1836 at Tottenham, where five days later his body was interred in the Quaker burial-ground. He was survived by his wife, who died on 23 February 1838.<br>
