<span class="headword">Thom,  Alexander</span>  (1801&#150;1879), <span class="occ">printer and writer</span>, was born on 18 April 1801 in Scotland (his place of birth may be Findhorn, or Bervie, or Aberdeen). His father, <a name="cosubject_27193"></a><span class="headword">Walter Thom</span>  (1770&#150;1824), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born at Bervie, Kincardineshire. He moved to Aberdeen where he wrote a <span class="italic">History of Aberdeen</span> (1811), and <span class="italic">Pedestrianism</span> (1813) celebrating particularly the athletic feats of Captain Robert Barclay Allardice. In 1813 he went to Dublin as editor of <span class="italic">The Correspondent</span>, later becoming editor and joint proprietor of the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>, a newspaper financially dependent on government patronage. Its circulation declined drastically in the 1820s to about 300 copies per issue. He was a founder member of the Association for the Suppression of Mendicity in Dublin in 1818. He also contributed to Brewster's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia</span>, to Sinclair's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</span>, and to Mason's <span class="italic">Statistical Account of Ireland</span>. He died in Dublin on 16 June 1824.<br>
<br>Alexander Thom went to Dublin in 1813 with his father and entered the printing business in 1816, working in the newspaper office. In 1824 he obtained, through the influence of Sir Robert Peel, the contract for printing for the Post Office of Ireland. In 1838 he obtained the contract for the printing for all royal commissions in Ireland. He took over the printing and publishing of the official <span class="italic">Dublin Gazette</span> in 1851, and in 1876 was appointed to the post of queen's printer for Ireland. In 1844 he founded the work by which he was subsequently known, the <span class="italic">Irish Almanack and Official Directory</span>, which in a short time superseded all other publications of the kind in the Irish capital. Its superiority to its predecessors was due to its inclusion of many valuable statistics relating to Ireland. Thom continued personally to supervise its publication until 1876 when he disposed of the copyright to his son-in-law, Frederick Pilkington. In 1862 he produced a valuable related work, <span class="italic">Thom's British Directory and Official Handbook of the United Kingdom</span>, the last edition of which was published in 1873. In 1860 he published at his own expense for gratuitous distribution <span class="italic">A collection of tracts and treatises illustrative of the natural history, antiquities, and the political and social state of Ireland</span>, two volumes which contain reprints of the works of Ware, Spenser, Davis, Petty, Berkeley, and other writers on Irish affairs in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In 1848 he became a founder member of the Dublin Statistical Society (later the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland), of which he was vice-president from 1871 to his death.<br>
<br>Thom, who was twice married, died at his residence, Donnycarney House, Coolock, near Dublin, on 22 December 1879. He was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin. His second wife, Sarah Mackay (<i>n&eacute;e</i> McCulloch) survived him until 1903, and bequeathed his historical library of 4000 volumes to the National Library of Ireland.<br>
