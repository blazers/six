<span class="headword">Livesey,  James</span>  (1833&#150;1925), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born at Preston, Lancashire, the youngest of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16796/', "Joseph Livesey (1794&#150;1884)")</script> and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Williams (<i>d</i>. 1869). Livesey was a precocious, innovative child, endowed with an enquiring mind. He demonstrated an early flair for engineering, an aptitude that was recognized and encouraged by his father, sometime proprietor of the <span class="italic">Preston Guardian</span> and a leading light in the local temperance movement. He was educated at Mr Isherwood's day school in Preston and apprenticed at the age of fourteen to Isaac Dodds, working on the Caledonian Railway. At the age of sixteen he entered the engineering works of Musgrave &amp; Co., Bolton, specialists in agricultural equipment. Subsequently, he worked at the famous Manchester locomotive firm, Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co. and served as a railway engineer in Spain on the Isabel II Railway, before establishing in Manchester in 1862 his own business, manufacturing newspaper-folding machinery. While in Spain he may have married a Spanish woman. A son, Fernando Harry, was born in 1860. He had at least two other sons, and two daughters. Later he practised as an engineering consultant, and it was in this capacity that he became associated with the Buenos Ayres Great Southern Railway Company, of which he became chief engineer, and thereafter several other British-owned South American railways, many of which were promoted by Alexander Henderson, first Baron Faringdon. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Iron and Steel Institute, and was director of the Costa Rica Markets Company Limited.<br>
<br>Livesey is credited with several inventions, including newspaper-folding and -cutting machinery (he presented a mechanically folded newspaper to Queen Victoria at the Great Exhibition in 1851), cast-iron railway sleepers (laid experimentally in Britain and Argentina), grain elevators, and domestic sanitation systems, but his career is most closely associated with the engineering consultancy business that he founded, successively James Livesey, James Livesey &amp; Son, Livesey, Son, and Henderson, and, ultimately, Livesey and Henderson. His early ventures were backed by his father; subsequently he obtained financial support from W. Owen, iron manufacturers and equipment makers of Rotherham, and from Alexander Henderson. In 1885 his son, Fernando Harry (later Sir Harry) Livesey (1860&#150;1932), joined the consultancy business, followed in 1891 by Henderson's brother, Brodie Haldane Henderson. Brodie Henderson became senior partner in 1893 when Livesey retired, and at this point the firm was known as Livesey and Henderson. Associated with railway engineering at a relatively early stage in the history of the industry, Livesey was from time to time connected with several prominent figures, including Thomas Brassey the contractor, Andrew Carnegie the American steel magnate, Sir Sandford Fleming, promoter of Canadian Railways, and George Hudson, the railway king. Besides working in Spain, he cultivated business contacts in France and Scandinavia and travelled extensively in the Americas, from Canada to Argentina. Touring in the USA and Canada, he familiarized himself with the distinct techniques of railway building in North America, and worked briefly as a railway engineer in Canada. Subsequently, he spent lengthy periods in the River Plate region, where he supervised work on a number of pioneer lines, including the Central Uruguay, the Buenos Ayres and Rosario, and the Entre R&iacute;os, in addition to the Buenos Ayres Great Southern. Under his direction, the partnership was also concerned with railway construction in Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Venezuela. Later the firm developed an extensive contract business in Africa.<br>
<br>After a colourful life, several times having been involved in serious railway accidents, Livesey died of pneumonia at his London residence, 4 Whitehall Court, Westminster, on 3 February 1925, at the age of ninety-two. He was buried at Rotherfield, his estate in Sussex, on 6 February. He was survived by three sons and two married daughters. In addition to an estate valued at over &pound;300,000, he left property in Sussex, and houses in France and Norway.<br>
