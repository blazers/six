<span class="headword">Hengler,  John Michael</span>  (1831&#150;1919), <span class="occ">tightrope walker and circus manager</span>, was born on 10 July 1831 at Lambeth, London, the fourth son of Henry Michael Hengler (1784&#150;1861) and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pilsworth (<i>c</i>.1790&#150;1869), of Dublin. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12926/', "(Frederick) Charles Hengler")</script> was his brother. The son of a famous circus rope-dancer, Hengler first appeared on the rope, without the aid of a balance pole, at the age of six. He also became an accomplished rider, and took part in hippodramatic sketches and spectacles. He was noted with Price and Powell's circus at Camden Town in 1843 performing backward and forward somersaults on the tightrope. In 1850 &#145;Young Hengler&#146; was turning somersaults on the rope while playing Louis Jullien's <span class="italic">Drum Polka</span> on a side drum or an overture on the violin. By 1851 he was billed as the &#145;Prince of Tight Rope Artistes&#146;, his sobriquet for the next twenty years. In 1852 he first performed the dramatic role of Hamlet: acting and dramatic recitations became part of his stock-in-trade. During a visit to Denmark in 1855 he performed before Frederick VII at Copenhagen. Hengler spent twelve months in the United States in 1856&#150;7, when he was based in New York. On his return he joined the new circus in Liverpool run by his brother Charles Hengler. He visited Copenhagen again in 1858, and later went on to Paris.<br>
<br>Hengler married Hannah Frances (1843&#150;1920), the daughter of Thomas Lloyd, a horse dealer, at St Silas's Church, Liverpool, on 6 August 1865. They had a son and five daughters, none of whom were to be associated with the circus. On the death of his eldest brother Edward Henry Hengler in January 1865, Hengler became sole proprietor of the Liverpool Riding School in Elizabeth Street, although he continued to perform in the arena. His last performance on the tightrope was in 1872 at Sheffield, when he also recited &#145;The Charge of the Light Brigade&#146;, accompanied by orchestral effects.<br>
<br>During the 1880s Hengler became a Liverpool shipowner and went into local politics: he was a member of the West Derby (Liverpool) local board from 1881 to 1890, serving as chairman for the year from April 1886. He was the last manager (1889&#150;95) of Hengler's circus in Argyll Street, London. He died at his residence, Airlie House, Meols Drive, Hoylake, Chester, on 17 November 1919, and was buried at Flaybrick Hill cemetery, Hoylake, on 19 November.<br>
