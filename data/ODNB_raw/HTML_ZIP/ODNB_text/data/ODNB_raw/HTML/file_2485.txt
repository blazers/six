<span class="headword">Bisset,  William</span>  (1758&#150;1834), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Raphoe</span>, was born on 27 October 1758, the son of the Revd Dr Alexander Bisset (<i>d</i>. 1782), chancellor of Armagh, into a family from Lessendrum, Drumblade, near Huntly, Aberdeenshire. Like his father, William was educated at Westminster School, where he was admitted a king's scholar in 1771, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 16 April 1775, and was elected a scholar in the same year; he graduated BA (4 November 1779), and MA (7 February 1782). In 1784 he was presented to the rectory of Dunbin, co. Louth, which he resigned upon his collation on 31 January 1791 to the prebend of Loughgall, or Levalleaglish, in the cathedral church of Armagh. In 1794 he became rector of Clonmore, and on 29 September 1804 was collated to the archdeaconry of Ross, in the united episcopate of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. In 1807 he resigned as prebend of Loughgall in order to become rector of Donoghmore, and was appointed in 1812 to the rectory of Loughgilly. All his preferments, with the exception of the archdeaconry of Ross, were within the diocese of Armagh. In August 1817 he was appointed to the chancellorship of Armagh, thus succeeding his father after an interval of twenty-five years.<br>
<br>In June 1822 Bisset was promoted by Marquess Wellesley, lord lieutenant of Ireland, to the bishopric of Raphoe. His administration of the diocese, which met with general approval, included the building of several churches and improvements to the palace at Raphoe. Bisset also made up the deficit in funds when the parliamentary grant was withdrawn from the Association for Discountenancing Vice. He was later pressed to become archbishop of Dublin following the death of William Magee in August 1831, but declined on the grounds of ill health. Bisset was married but nothing is known of his wife except that she predeceased him. He died on 5 September 1834, while on a visit to his nephew at Lessendrum. His clergy erected to his memory a monument in Raphoe Cathedral, with an inscription by W. Archer Butler. At his death the see of Raphoe became annexed to that of Derry.<br>
