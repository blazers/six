<span class="headword">Watson,  Lewis</span>, first Baron Rockingham  (<em>bap. </em>1584, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, eldest son of Sir Edward Watson (<i>d</i>. 1617) and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1612), daughter of Kenelm Digby of Stoke Dry, Rutland, was born at Rockingham, Northamptonshire, and baptized there on 14 July 1584. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 24 May 1599, but did not graduate. He was admitted to the Middle Temple as a student in 1601. He was constantly at the court of James VI and I over the following years and was knighted on 19 August 1608. He was associated with George Villiers, later earl and then duke of Buckingham. He had succeeded his father on 1 March 1617; on 21 July 1619 he received by patent the fee simple of Rockingham Castle which he had previously held by knight service. On 23 June 1621 he was created a baronet. He married twice. His first wife was Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1611), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2275/', "Peregrine Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby")</script>. They married in 1609 but she died in childbirth. His second wife, whom he married on 3 October 1620, was Eleanor Manners (<i>d</i>. 1679), daughter of Sir George Manners of Haddon Hall, Derbyshire. They had six children, a son and five daughters.<br>
<br>Watson sat for Lincoln in the Addled Parliament of 1614 and in the parliaments of 1621 and 1624. In his own county he was a commissioner for martial law and oyer and terminer in 1628, and in 1632&#150;3 served as high sheriff. He was master of the royal buckhounds from 1634 and verderer of Rockingham Forest from 1638. He failed to provide a horse for a muster at Huntingdon during the second bishops' war, for which he was summoned by the privy council.<br>
<br>Watson was a nominal royalist who at the outset of the civil war was appointed commissioner of array for Northamptonshire, on 4 July 1642. He was also ordered to garrison Rockingham Castle. Before he did so, the parliamentarian commander of the east midland association, Lord Grey of Groby, seized the castle on 19 March 1643 and installed a garrison himself. The role of Watson in this is unclear. There were claims in the royalist press that he had facilitated the surrender of the castle and that he was living under parliamentarian protection at Stoke Park in Northampton after Rockingham had been garrisoned. Some time in early June 1643 the royalist regional commander Henry Hastings had Watson arrested and imprisoned at the garrison at Belvoir Castle and for this he was thanked in an anonymous letter by &#145;certain inhabitants of the counties of Northampton, Rutland and Leicester&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.102). The garrison at Rockingham served as a base for part of the Northamptonshire county committee and the garrison was able to infiltrate royalist territory in the east midlands throughout the war. The castle was used to imprison some royalist captives after the battle of Naseby (14 June 1645).<br>
<br>Watson petitioned the king for his freedom in June 1643 and Hastings was asked to send &#145;whatsoever shall be objected against him&#146; by Secretary Edward Nicholas on 13 June  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 2.103). By the beginning of 1645 Watson had not only cleared his name, but on 29 January Charles I ennobled him as Baron Rockingham of Rockingham. He was resident at Oxford until the garrison surrendered in June 1646. The defeat of the royalists left Watson facing a composition levy of &pound;5000 for his delinquency. He died on 5 January 1653 and was buried in Rockingham church a week later. His widow died in London on 23 October 1679 and was buried with her husband at Rockingham on 8 November.<br>
