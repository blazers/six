<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Esdall,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1755), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, was born in Dublin, the third of six sons of James Esdall (<i>d</i>. 1728), a hatter, and his wife, Margaret. Esdall's family was middle-class Irish of the trade culture; and, at a time when social class, religion, and politics were closely linked, the Esdalls were probably protestant, as the principal influences on Esdall's career&#151;his master and mentor, George Faulkner, that prince of Dublin printers, and Esdall's principal compatriot, Charles Lucas, a zealous Irish whig nationalist and polemical writer&#151;were both attached to mostly protestant circles. In a vigorous career of no more than eleven years, Esdall produced a broad range of material for the rapidly expanding Irish markets. Contributing to Dublin's developing status as an international print centre, he and his small family-operated firm launched as many as four Irish newspapers; issued reprints of London editions of popular English novels, plays, and poetry anthologies; printed and sold works by Irish writers; and incurred serious legal penalties by printing and selling inflammatory political material on Anglo-Irish relations and municipal reform in Dublin.<h2>
<a name="Earlybeginnings"></a>Early beginnings</h2>Recorded data on Esdall's early beginnings are thin  (Pollard, <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, 182&#150;3), but as a true son of the trade culture he was reared and educated accordingly. His apprenticeship at George Faulkner's printing house on Essex Street, Dublin, probably began shortly after his father's death in 1728. Like Faulkner, who learned his trade from the learned London printer and scholar William Bowyer the younger, Esdall received prestigious formal training and invaluable exposure. At Faulkner's busy book hub, with its lively book chat and daily round of commercial dealings, Esdall witnessed at first hand the mechanics and politics of the eighteenth-century Irish print culture. Moreover, in Faulkner himself, Esdall had an imposing career model of the Irish patriot printer, willing to incur both rancour and litigation for his beliefs; and in a city rife with piratical printers, Faulkner also served as a model of correct business practice, notwithstanding his copyright and distribution imbroglios with the English novelist Samuel Richardson. In 1735 Faulkner engaged his promising apprentice in the issue of a slight, but sensitive, anonymous publication, <span class="italic">Observations upon &hellip; Holding Ecclesiastical Benefices &hellip; together with Fellowships in the University of Dublin</span>&#151;the first of many career intersections between master and pupil.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1744 Esdall was sworn and admitted free by service of the printers' guild of St Luke the Evangelist; he was paid quarterage from 1744 until 1755, the year of his death. In 1744 he set up as a printer and bookseller on Fishamble Street, Smock Alley, Dublin, the first of his two family-operated establishments. Dublin printers and bookmen doubtless counted Esdall among Faulkner's most enterprising prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, for during the first half of his career&#151;the years preceding his hazardous association with Lucas in 1749&#151;he achieved an impressive list of imprints; and many of these books and pamphlets were printed on paper manufactured by the Irish home market (&#145;Buy Irish!&#146; the cry of many Dublin tradesmen).<br>
<br>On Fishamble Street, Esdall printed and sold a range of material attractive to Dublin readers with interests political, literary, and feminist. Though the four newspapers he issued reflected largely political material, Esdall's book stock consisted mostly of inexpensive reprints of London imprints. His record of imprints began on 20 March 1744 with an important political text, the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Sheriffs and Commons of &hellip; Dublin &hellip; Relating to Controverted Matters in the City</span>. A shrewd self-promoter, Esdall printed a full-page advertisement on the last page of the book for a recent issue of his, <span class="italic">A Vindication of &hellip; Captain Middleton, F.R.S., in a Late Voyage Aboard H.M.S., the &#147;Furace,&#148; for the Discovery of the North-West Passage</span>. On 31 March the firm launched its first of four newspapers, the <span class="italic">Flying Post</span>, of short duration, followed in October by his <span class="italic">General News-Letter</span> (ten numbers), an unremarkable digest of domestic and foreign intelligence. Clearly Esdall had not as yet found his voice.<br>
<br>With the relative success of his first year in business, Esdall moved his premises on 16 November 1745 to the Blind Quay, at the corner of Copper Alley on Cork Hill, his base of operations for the next ten years. To his new premises, he brought the capable woman who became his helpmate and unofficial business partner, <a name="cosubject_64320"></a><span class="headword">Anne Esdall <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Middleton]</span></span>  (1717/18&#150;<em>c.</em>1795), <span class="occ">printer and bookseller</span>, whom he had married on 31 August 1745  (<span class="italic">Dublin Courant</span>, 3 Sept 1745). Esdall now restyled his <span class="italic">General News-Letter</span> and reissued it under a more assertive and proprietary title: <span class="italic">Esdall's News-Letter</span>. The paper, which ran (sometimes irregularly) thrice weekly for nearly ten years, spoke to tradesmen and men of business; and it gave a special focus to timely political, urban, and guild news in Dublin and London, as well as in the new American colonies, in Africa, and on the continent. <span class="italic">Esdall's News-Letter</span> was the economic mainstay of the firm and of Esdall's career; and its income from advertising sales must have been steady, if not robust (&#145;Advertisements are inserted in this paper at a British Half-Crown for the first, and a British sixpence for each time after&#146;: no. 400, Wednesday, 13 June 1750). Esdall regularly ran illustrated advertisements for such local establishments as Hibby's Optical Shop, Rourke's Parrot (a clothes shop), and Newman's, where Dubliners could buy &#145;leather breeches of a black kind, for customers who fancy them&#146;  (no. 397, 6 June 1750).<br>
<br>Concurrently with his work on the <span class="italic">News-Letter</span>, Esdall regularly reprinted, or sold reprints of, English imprints (both new and old) which capitalized on the heated political climate of the mid-1740s&#151;among these <span class="italic">The question of whether Great Britain and Ireland can be otherwise than miserable under a popish king?</span>; and <span class="italic">The Free Briton's Answer to the Pretender's Declaration &hellip; by the Archbishop of Yorke</span>, followed two years later by a reprint of a popular anonymous London ballad, <span class="italic">Lovat's Ghost</span>, occasioned by the recent public beheading of a notorious Jacobite intriguer Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat. Other works from this period include new material by Irish writers such as James Eyre Weekes whose poem <span class="italic">The Amazon</span>, together with <span class="italic">To the Ladies of Dublin</span> (both 1745), indicates the firm's awareness of Dublin's growing number of women readers. Its output notwithstanding, this first half of Esdall's career was blandly uneventful as compared with the tumult soon to follow.<h2>
<a name="Troublesandlatercareer17491754"></a>Troubles and later career, 1749&#150;1754</h2>Esdall's first professional association with Charles Lucas had led to the publication in March 1744 of Lucas's uncharacteristically temperate work, <span class="italic">Divelina libera: an Apology of the Civil Rights and Liberties of the Citizens of Dublin</span>. Beginning in 1749, however, Esdall's association with Lucas developed into a dangerous partnership, with fatal results for his career. First, Esdall printed in pamphlet format some twenty political addresses by Lucas on Irish constitutional freedom and the corruption of the House of Commons. Second, he furthered his partnership with Lucas by printing Lucas's political newspaper (the fourth newspaper from the Esdall firm), <span class="italic">The Censor, or, The Citizen's Journal</span>. And, third, he printed in June 1749 Lucas's chief work, the bold <span class="italic">Magna charta libertatum civitatis Dublini</span>, which he actively promoted in his newspaper (1 June 1749).<br>
<br>The authorities did not share Esdall's enthusiasm. Lucas had manifestly succeeded in focusing strong attention on himself and his polemical writings&#151;and the authorities were keen to stop him and his brisk printer. Finding Lucas's <span class="italic">Charter</span> thoroughly subversive, the chief justice examined Esdall on 16 June 1749; Esdall admitted to his (and Lucas's) role in Lucas's political writings  (<span class="italic">Censor</span>, 17). On 11&#150;16 October 1749 the House of Commons resolved that Lucas's newspaper and pamphlets&#151;all printed by Esdall&#151;promoted sedition and insurrection (<span class="italic">The Tryal of Mr Charles Lucas</span>, 1749; <span class="italic">Collins' Pamphlets</span>, 54, no. 16). Facing prosecution, Esdall refused to co-operate when summoned to be taken into custody. His subsequent actions remain unclear, though it appears that he went into hiding, was incarcerated, or fled Ireland for London, the continent, or even the new (hospitable) book centres of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. On 5 December 1749 Anne Esdall, in lieu of her absent husband, was examined by the Commons about &#145;scandalous&#146; and &#145;factious libels&#146; emanating from the Esdall firm  (<span class="italic">Journals of the House of Commons of &hellip; Ireland</span>, 5.27&#150;8). In May 1750 the grand jury presented Lucas's writings as &#145;seditious libels&#146; to be publicly burnt, with severe penalties for the author and publisher (Gilbert Library, Dublin, Robinson MS 31, nos. 6 and 7; <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>, 15).<br>
<br>These troubles seriously disrupted the operations and profits of Esdall's firm, resulting in a significant, and evidently irrecoverable, loss of income. In summer 1750 Esdall returned to public life and attempted to recover his recent shortfall with a flurry of new issues and stock; among these were <span class="italic">The Case and Tryal of John Peter Zenger, Printer, for a Libel Against the Government</span> (a famous case of its kind, with particular applications to Esdall's troubles); Colley Cibber's classical imitations from Horace and Pindar, <span class="italic">A Rhapsody upon the Marvellous</span> (London, 1751; Esdall reprint, Dublin, 1751); Henry Fielding's essay on urban reform, <span class="italic">Examples of the Interposition of Providence</span> (London, 1752; Esdall reprint, Dublin, 1752); and Lord Bolingbroke's <span class="italic">Letters on the Study and Use of History</span> (London, 1752; Dublin reprint, 1752).<br>
<br>James Esdall died in Dublin, aged about thirty-five years, on 24 March 1755. He was survived by his wife and their four children. Esdall's death was mentioned solemnly by his former master and mentor, George Faulkner, whose poignant homage mentioned his former apprentice's short and sad life: &#145;He suffered very much in Health and Fortune by some certain People whom he espoused&#146;, suggesting, perhaps, Lucas's betrayal of Esdall when Esdall most needed him. Faulkner appealed to the public to assist the widow Esdall and her &#145;four helpless children&#146; (<span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>, 25 [1755]; Pollard, <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, 183).<br>
<br>The Esdall firm continued after Esdall's death under the direction of Anne Esdall, with the firm's former journeyman, Henry Saunders, who had been taken on in 1749. She had announced these plans in the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span> (1 April 1755). In 1755 she issued <span class="italic">A Vindication of the Conduct of Mr John McCannon</span> and an edition of Edmund Gibson's <span class="italic">Experimental Philosophy</span>, sold by Oliver Nelson, an active Dublin bookseller&#150;printer and former business associate of her late husband's. But operations soon foundered, and Mrs Esdall had to liquidate the firm's stock, its equipment, and even the household furniture  (<span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>, 7 [1755]). Saunders then took over the firm, promptly restyling <span class="italic">Esdall's News-Letter</span> as <span class="italic">Saunders' News-Letter</span> (1755&#150;74; Munter, 243). One of Saunders's apprentices was his former employer's son, William Esdall (<i>d</i>. 1795), husband of Elizabeth Levinge, who was apprenticed to Saunders in 1763 and admitted free of the guild in 1777. After William's death in 1795, Anne Esdall, aged seventy-seven, petitioned the printers' guild for relief. Three guineas were granted  (Pollard, <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, 182). Anne herself died about 1795.<br>
<br>James Esdall is an important figure in the history of Irish political journalism and Ireland's print culture during the mid-eighteenth century. The necessary man, beneath the blast and counter blast of reputation, lies in the factual record of his life and work. At great personal and professional jeopardy, he was an ardent promoter of Irish talent, Irish writings, and a free Irish press. An ethical businessman in a kingdom rife with surreptitious and unauthorized imprints&#151;not to mention rogue printers&#151;Esdall worked congenially and ethically with stationers and writers in London and in Dublin. In the lineage of protean Irish patriots of his day&#151;Molesworth, Molyneux, Swift, Lucas, Faulkner&#151;James Esdall merits inclusion.<br>
