<span class="headword">Vaughan, Sir  Gruffudd, fychan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1447), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was the son of Gruffudd ab Ieuan ap Madog of Powys and his wife, Mallt (Maud), daughter of Griffri ap Rhys Bongam of Broniarth. The father was implicated in Glyn D&#373;r's rebellion and his estates (valued at 20 marks) were forfeited in 1404. Of Broniarth and Trelydan in Powys, the son was one of that breed of independent Welsh gentry (<i>uchelwyr</i>) who prospered after Glyn D&#373;r's rebellion in the service of marcher lords, in Vaughan's case the lords of Powys and the Stafford lords of Caus. Lack of evidence obscures much of his career, and the native Welsh poetry addressed to him concentrates primarily on his military prowess. Gruffudd Vaughan was apparently not involved in the rebellion; a later pedigree identifies him as a burgess in Welshpool in 1406, though the identification is uncertain. He may have accompanied Henry V to France, but the tradition that he was made a knight-banneret at Agincourt (1415) is unsubstantiated. In November 1417 Vaughan and his brother, Ieuan ap Gruffudd, described as gentlemen, with two others made themselves notorious by capturing, on their ancestral estate at Broniarth, Sir John Oldcastle, the Lollard upon whose head a price of 1000 marks had been set. Various privileges were granted them for this act&#151;including a pardon of murders and felonies and the right to hold their lands free of certain rents and services&#151;by a charter dated 6 July 1419 from Edward Charlton, lord of Powys, to whom they had delivered Oldcastle at Welshpool. At Shrewsbury on 4 March 1421, in the presence of Henry V, the duke of Gloucester, and the earl of Stafford, the four captors acknowledged that they had received their portion of the reward from Charlton.<br>
<br>According to the poet Hywel Cilan, Vaughan was honoured in London and then knighted, with others, in a town beyond Rouen, presumably an allusion to service in France. If, as Hywel states (and the poet Lewys Glyn Cothi repeats), he was &#145;aureated&#146; by Henry VI and his counsellors, this may have occurred when the king visited Rouen and Paris in 1430&#150;32; the earl of Stafford was in the royal entourage. As a knight Vaughan was in receipt of an annuity of 5 marks from Stafford by 1441&#150;2. In the following year he appears in the retinue of Sir Christopher Talbot, the youngest son of the earl of Shrewsbury and a notable jouster: on 10 August 1443 his lance pierced Talbot's heart at Caus and, as a result, Vaughan and his son Rheinallt (or Reynold) were outlawed and a price of 500 marks was placed on the father's head. His capture was effected by Henry Grey, count of Tancarville and one of the heirs of the Charltons of Powys, who summoned Sir Gruffudd to Powis Castle and gave what Sir Gruffudd considered a &#145;safe conduct&#146;. Immediately on his arrival within the courtyard he was summarily beheaded, on 9 July 1447. This event was the occasion of poetical laments by Lewys Glyn Cothi and Dafydd Llwyd of Mathafarn. On 20 July 1447 a treasury warrant was issued for the payment of the 500 marks to Grey. The deed has been attributed to jealousy on Grey's part because Sir Gruffudd claimed descent from the ancient princes of Powys, and may have laid claim to some of Grey's lands. His sons Rheinallt and Dafydd accepted a pardon on 21 December 1448.<br>
<br>Sir Gruffudd married first Margaret, daughter and coheir of Gruffudd ap Jenkin of Broniarth, and second Margaret, daughter of Madog of Hope. He had three sons and three daughters. The eldest son was David Llwyd (<i>d</i>. 1489) of Leighton, ancestor of the Lloyds of Marrington, Marton, and Stockton; the second, Cadwalader, was ancestor of the Lloyds of Maes-mawr; and the third, Rheinallt, was ancestor of the Wynnes of Garth and of the Lloyds of Broniarth and Gaerfawr.<br>
