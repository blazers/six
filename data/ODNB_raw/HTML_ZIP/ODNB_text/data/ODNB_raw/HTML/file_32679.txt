<span class="headword">Curtis,  William Edward</span>  (1889&#150;1969), <span class="occ">experimental physicist</span>, was born on 23 October 1889 at Islington, London, the younger child and only son of Charles Curtis, a gilder, originally of Horsham in Sussex, and his wife, Emily Sarah Haward, from Ipswich. He was outstanding at school (Owen's, Islington), and at Imperial College, London, where he graduated with a first-class degree in physics in 1910. He was awarded the governor's scholarship in 1908 and 1909 and shared the Tyndall prize in 1908. Later he became the first student ever to take the new London University honours degree in astronomy, obtaining a first. He was appointed to a college demonstratorship at Imperial and his research was supervised by Alfred Fowler.<br>
<br>Fowler introduced Curtis to some of the major problems in spectroscopy, particularly to the observation that certain stellar spectra have lines with wavelengths close to some of the Balmer lines of hydrogen and yet are apparently emitted by helium. Niels Bohr solved this problem in 1913 as an extension to his theory of the hydrogen atom, when he showed that these lines are due to ionized helium; contemporaneous experimental work by Fowler and Curtis proved that the lines are definitely due to helium and not to a new form of hydrogen as certain scientists had assumed. In the course of this work Curtis discovered a unique band spectrum, emitted by excited helium, which was to become his main research interest, though temporarily interrupted by the First World War.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war Curtis was in Riga waiting to go to Kiev to observe a solar eclipse. The expedition was called off and Curtis returned to England by a devious route and enlisted as a sapper in the Royal Naval division. After initial training he was sent to Gallipoli where he served during the whole campaign, being twice mentioned in dispatches. For the rest of the war he was an instructor in the wireless training centre at Malvern.<br>
<br>In 1918 Curtis married (Adeline Mary) Grace, the only daughter of Charles Mitchell, of the War Office; they had two children, a son, who became a physicist, and a daughter, who became a doctor and the wife of Professor R. L. Plackett. On demobilization Curtis returned to Imperial College and to his study of spectra. From the college he moved in 1919 to a lectureship at the University of Sheffield, then to a readership at King's College, London, and finally to a professorship at Armstrong College at Newcastle upon Tyne in the University of Durham. In each of these posts he made his mark, gradually blossoming on the research side into a world specialist on band spectra and on the teaching side into a gifted lecturer noted for his skill in demonstration. He published many scientific papers but perhaps the most important were those in the decade 1922&#150;32 on the band spectrum of the helium molecule, for which accurate wavelength measurements could be made and the theoretical predictions of the new quantum mechanics tested with great precision. For his contributions to spectroscopy he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1934.<br>
<br>Curtis took up his professorship at Newcastle upon Tyne in 1926 and for more than forty years took a leading part in the educational life of Armstrong College, the university, and the city. As the head of the physics department he built up strong research schools in spectroscopy and acoustics. Later a school of theoretical physics was created. In 1931 a serious constitutional upheaval began involving Armstrong College and the Medical College and Curtis, as a senior science professor, reluctantly, but inevitably, became much involved. The outcome was a royal commission and the creation of one large college named King's College under a rector.<br>
<br>Curtis's contributions to the Second World War were varied. After chairmanship of the Durham University recruiting board he moved in 1940 to Leamington Spa as director of camouflage and decoy, and when air attacks diminished became successively a scientific adviser at the Ministry of Home Security, with Solly Zuckerman and J. D. Bernal, and then, in 1943, superintendent of applied explosives at Fort Halstead.<br>
<br>On returning to Newcastle, Curtis became more and more involved in college and public affairs. He was sub-rector of King's for three years (1947&#150;50), president of the Institute of Physics (1950&#150;52), and senior adviser in civil defence for the north-eastern region. For his work for civil defence he was appointed CBE in 1967, and in 1969 the University of Newcastle named its largest theatre the Curtis Auditorium.<br>
<br>Curtis retired in 1955 but continued to be very active, especially in lectures whose purpose was to stimulate interest in science in young people by showing demonstrations for which school facilities were inadequate. They succeeded admirably and drew huge audiences for many years. Outside his professional life he was impressive as a man of many parts. He had boundless physical energy and played many games well, especially cricket. He liked music and was a modest performer. He died at Newcastle upon Tyne on 6 May 1969.<br>
