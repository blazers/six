<span class="headword">Mackintosh,  Margaret  Macdonald</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Margaret Macdonald]</span>  (1864&#150;1933), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and designer</span>, was born on 5 November 1864 in Tipton, Staffordshire, the second of the five children of John Macdonald (1825&#150;1895), engineer and colliery manager, and his wife, Frances Grove Hardeman (1838&#150;1912), daughter of Joseph Hardeman, counting house clerk, and his wife, Harriet Moore. Her father was from Glasgow, her mother from Cradley Heath, Staffordshire. Her younger sister <a name="cosubject_39323"></a><span class="headword">Frances Eliza Macdonald</span>  (1873&#150;1921), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 24 August 1873 in Ravenscliff Road, Kidsgrove, Stafford. Margaret was educated at Orme Girls' School in north Staffordshire until she was sixteen and attended an art school in Germany in her late teens or early twenties. In 1890 after her father's retirement and subsequent move to 9 Windsor Terrace, Glasgow, Margaret and her sister Frances immediately began attending classes at the Glasgow School of Art. Four years after her father's death in 1895, Margaret moved with her mother to live with her brother Charles at Dunglass Castle, Bowling, near Glasgow.<br>
<br>Macdonald's watercolour drawings and designs attracted attention in Glasgow in 1894, the year she completed her studies, because of her tendency to distort and elongate the human form. A poster advertising a Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts Exhibition (1895) made with her sister Frances and the architect and designer (James) Herbert McNair (1868&#150;1955) signalled Macdonald's appreciation for a collaborative art-making practice. After 1896 she established her reputation as a metalworker. The clock she designed and made with Frances Macdonald and her own beaten metal panel <span class="italic">The Annunciation</span> (exh. London Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, 1896) received accolades from London's prestigious art journal <span class="italic">The Studio</span> while, at the same time, the journal acknowledged the &#145;eccentricity&#146; of the work that deserved its nickname &#145;the spooky school&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Studio</span>, 9, 1896, 202). The Macdonald sisters along with their future husbands, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34764/', "Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868&#150;1928)")</script> and (James) Herbert McNair (who married Frances on 14 June 1899 at the Scottish Episcopal church in Dumbarton), would come to be called the Glasgow Four by later critics and art historians; the art they made became part of the regionally defined Glasgow style. Frances Macdonald's work featured in several art journals including <span class="italic">The Studio</span> and the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>. She died on 12 December 1921 aged forty-eight at 50 Gibson Street, Glasgow. Most of her work was destroyed by her husband, together with his own.<br>
<br>In 1898 Margaret was elected a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour. She exhibited intermittently with them until 1922, becoming a member of their council from 1907 to 1909 and again from 1911 to 1913, and remaining a member of the society until 1924. Her watercolour pictures, for example <span class="italic">Mysterious Garden</span> (1911; priv. coll.), most frequently represent aloof or mysterious women either with elongated, emaciated bodies or with bodies hidden by diaphanous garments which resemble flowers in full bloom. However, Margaret made her most exciting and well-known work for interiors designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. It is this work that is now most frequently seen in exhibitions, for example, in the highly praised &#145;&#147;Glasgow Girls&#148;: Women in Art and Design, 1880&#150;1920&#146; (Glasgow, 1990) and &#145;Charles Rennie Mackintosh&#146; (Glasgow, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, 1996 and 1997), and is on permanent display in the reconstructed Mackintosh&#150;Macdonald house in the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow.<br>
<br>On 22 August 1900 Macdonald married the architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh in the Scottish Episcopal church at Dumbarton near Glasgow. The couple lived at 120 Mains Street, Glasgow, until 1906 when they moved into their personally decorated flat at 6 Florentine Terrace. While the couple lived in Glasgow, Margaret designed a number of gesso panels for Mackintosh interiors including <span class="italic">The May Queen</span> for the Ingram Street tea-rooms (1900; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries), <span class="italic">O ye who Walk in Willowwood</span> (1903; Glasgow Museums and Art Galleries) for the Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street, and the <span class="italic">Seven Princesses</span> (<i>c</i>.1906; &Ouml;sterreichisches Museum f&uuml;r Angewandte Kunst, Vienna) for the home of the Viennese financier Fritz W&auml;rndorfer. All the panels, like the watercolour paintings, depict women. They demonstrate Macdonald Mackintosh's ability to introduce an exquisitely sophisticated linear design into the sumptuous texture so characteristic of gesso work.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1914 the couple holidayed in Walberswick, Suffolk; then, rather than returning to Glasgow, the Mackintoshes moved to London where both kept studios in Chelsea. In 1923 the Mackintoshes left for France, staying first in Collioure then in Port Vendres, where they were able to live on their modest income. They returned to London in 1927, when Charles Rennie Mackintosh received treatment for cancer. When her husband died in 1928, Margaret stayed for a time at 12 Porchester Square, London, returned briefly to France, and then based herself in her Glebe Place studio in Chelsea. She died at 39 Royal Avenue, Chelsea, London, on 7 January 1933 and was cremated at Golders Green on 10 January. Much of her work can be viewed in the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow.<br>
