<span class="headword">Warburton,  Henry</span>  (1784&#150;1858), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Lambeth, Surrey, on 12 November 1784, the son of John Warburton of Eltham, Kent, a timber merchant, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Abel Aldridge. His baptism was recorded in the register of nonconformists at Dr Williams's Library. He was educated at Eton College (he was in the fifth form, upper division, in 1799) and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted on 24 June 1802. He was in the first class of the college examinations as freshman in 1803, and as junior soph in 1804. He was admitted scholar on 13 April 1804, graduated BA (being twelfth wrangler and placed next to Ralph Bernal) in 1806, and proceeded MA in 1812. George Pryme knew him in his undergraduate days, and both Bernal and Pryme were later his colleagues in political action. While at Cambridge he obtained distinction as a &#145;scholar and man of science&#146;  (Grote, 76).<br>
<br>For some years after leaving the university Warburton was engaged in the timber trade at Lambeth. He took over his father's business in 1808 and gained great experience of the Baltic timber trade, but his interest in science and politics ultimately led to his abandoning commercial life, and in 1831 he ceased trading. He led a long and eventually successful campaign against the timber duties. He was elected FRS on 16 February 1809. Dr William Hyde Wollaston was his closest friend, and in the autumn of 1818 they made a tour together on the continent. When Michael Faraday desired to become FRS, Warburton had objections to his election, on the ground that Faraday had on one occasion treated Wollaston unfairly. Correspondence ensued, and these objections were dispelled  (H. B. Jones, <span class="italic">The Life and Letters of Faraday</span>, 2 vols., 1870, 1.347&#150;53). Warburton was also a member of the Political Economy Club from its foundation in 1821 to his death, and introduced its discussion on tithes, rents, and profits on 13 January 1823. He became a close friend of David Ricardo, who often mentions him in his <span class="italic">Letters to Malthus</span>. &#145;Philosopher Warburton&#146;, as he was nicknamed, was one of the leading supporters of Brougham in founding London University, and was a member of its first council in 1827.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1826 Warburton was returned to parliament for the borough of Bridport in Dorset as a radical. He made his first long speech on 30 November, on foreign goods, and was re-elected in 1830, 1831, 1833, 1835, 1837, and 1841, all of the elections after the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832 being severely contested. Even after the 1832 act, Bridport only had 500 voters; it was notoriously corrupt, as well as being dominated by the naval interest. Here Warburton's lumber experience assisted him and he topped the poll. On 8 September 1841 Warburton resigned his seat on the ground that a petition would have &#145;proved gross bribery against his colleague [John Romilly]&#146; in which his own agent would have been implicated  (Grote, 144). It subsequently came out that before the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> he himself had paid large sums of money improperly to certain of the electors. A select committee was appointed to inquire into &#145;corrupt compromises&#146; alleged to have been made in certain constituencies, so as to avoid investigation into past transactions, and the question whether bribery had been practised at Bridport was referred to the same committee, but nothing resulted from its investigations. Warburton was out of the Commons until 9 November 1843, when he was elected for Kendal. At the dissolution of 1847 he retired from political life, letting it be known that the reforms which he had at heart had been effected.<br>
<br>Warburton's constituency difficulties were similar to those of a number of radicals in the 1830s: they were reformers returned by what were really pre-reform constituencies. Warburton was in some respects an &#145;avowed Benthamite&#146;  (Richardson, 108), but he did not always act with the philosophic radical group, and indeed in 1837 was the subject of severe personal ridicule from Sir William Molesworth in the Commons  (Thomas, 239). He was, however, more associated with the group around Molesworth, George Grote, and Charles Buller than any other. In January 1835 Warburton, who was already in contact with Daniel O'Connell on electoral matters, developed a plan for three &#145;brigades&#146; to enable a progressive government to gain a majority in the Commons. He secured O'Connell's support for a united opposition front to Peel's tory government. Warburton himself sent off individual circulars summoning the Irish MPs to the important meeting in Lichfield House on 18 February 1836, which produced the Lichfield House compact, described as &#145;one of the most decisive events in British political history between 1832 and 1847&#146;  (Macintyre, 144). It would be wrong to say that Warburton made the compact, but it would be fair to say that he enabled it.<br>
<br>Warburton was an indefatigable MP, who often spent twelve hours a day in the house. He was active in a variety of causes, such as bankruptcy, the repeal of the stamp duty on newspapers, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>, and the introduction of penny postage (he was secretary of the select committee on postal reform). He was also noted for his success in achieving the reduction and then abolition of the timber duties; he was a member of the select committee on them in 1835&#150;6. In the course of this he was in March 1836 the subject of a censure motion by G. F. Young, who claimed that Warburton had fiddled his evidence to the committee to suit his case (Young withdrew his motion when Warburton gained whiggish support).<br>
<br>It was, however, as the spokesman in the Commons for the medical reformers that Warburton's chief impact was made. Following an exchange with Peel in 1827 and the lectures given by George Birkbeck that year, Warburton persuaded the Commons to establish the select committee on anatomy in 1828 (dealing with the supply of corpses for dissection and &#145;bodysnatching&#146;), wrote its report, and played a central role in the passing of the <span class="roman">Anatomy Act</span> (after several attempts) in 1832. Warburton hoped the measure would deal not only with corpses but also with the domestic conditions of the poor. His intention was &#145;to bring science to the poor man's door&#146;  (Richardson, chap. 8) but in this wider hope he was largely disappointed  (ibid., 210&#150;15). Warburton's reform acted as a focus for medical reformers generally and for the Benthamites, and sometimes took a curious direction: Richard Carlile gave a gross speech in 1829 announcing that his corpse would be left for dissection, with his skin to be used to cover an armchair for Warburton  (ibid., 168). Warburton was later attacked by William Roberts for being himself a shareholder in the London University anatomy school and for applying the act &#145;to advance the pecuniary interests of himself and his friends &hellip; by a traffic in the bodies of the poor&#146;  (ibid., 248). The accusation rested on the failure of the act to prohibit the sale of corpses; despite the serious character of the charges, Warburton did not sue for libel though he attacked Roberts in the Commons. He tried to improve the act by a commission in 1840, which failed to report. In 1834 Warburton was chairman of a select committee on the medical profession and in 1840 he, Thomas Wakley (with whom he had disagreed on the anatomy question), and Benjamin Hawes introduced a bill to register medical practitioners and establish a college of medicine, a proposal which the vested interests of the medical profession quickly saw off.<br>
<br>Warburton, who was unmarried, died at his home, 45 Cadogan Place, Chelsea, London, on 16 September 1858 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. He frequently sailed near the wind, and sometimes almost capsized; but his significance in early Victorian parliamentary radicalism was considerable.<br>
