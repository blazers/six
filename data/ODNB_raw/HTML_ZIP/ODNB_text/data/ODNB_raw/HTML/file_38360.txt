<span class="headword">Barlow,  James</span>  (1767&#150;1839), <span class="occ">obstetric surgeon</span>, was born at Croichley Fold Farm, Hawkshaw, Lancashire, the son of William Barlow (<i>d</i>. 1815) and his wife, Catherine Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1768); they also had a daughter, Catherine, and an elder son, John. He was a descendant of the Barlows and the Taylors of Turton, though he claimed to be the descendant of Sir Alexander Barlow. The <span class="italic">Palatine Note-Book</span> for 1884 mentions that Barlow discovered and acquired a portrait of Sir Alexander painted in 1616. After training at Manchester he may have attended St Bartholomew's Hospital since he later dedicated his major publication to three well-known teachers at the hospital. About 1790 Barlow, a Roman Catholic, began to practise in Chorley, Lancashire. In 1793 he was called to see Jane Foster in Blackrod, where he performed a caesarean section on Wednesday, 27 November 1793. This was the first such operation in Britain where the mother survived. In this particular case the patient lived a long life, dying at the age of seventy-six in October 1829. During this operation Barlow's assistant, a local general practitioner, fainted and Barlow had to rely on a female attendant to assist in the procedure. Barlow went on to perform a further three such operations in his career. Barlow's triumph was referred to during a debate in 1798 between two well-known Manchester doctors, John Hull and William Simmons. Hull, although a champion of the caesarean section, attempted to minimize the importance of Barlow's achievement, claiming that Barlow only removed the foetus from the peritoneum. Hull's remarks may have been motivated by the fact that Barlow's estranged wife, Elizabeth Winstanley, was Hull's sister-in-law.<br>
<br>After the breakdown of his marriage (which lasted only a matter of months), Barlow established himself in practice at Blackburn in 1795. He never married again but in 1812 adopted a son, James Barlow Stewardson Sturdy, who later became the mayor of Blackburn. Barlow inherited &pound;12,000 cash and significant valuable property on the death of his father in 1815. He also built up a lucrative practice.<br>
<br>Barlow was the first to suture the uterus after caesarean section. He strongly advocated the use of callipers for pelvimetry, and described various degrees of pelvic deformity and gave indications of the mode of delivery in each case; he designed and described the sound, a polished solid steel instrument. Barlow published <span class="italic">Essays on Surgery and Midwifery: with Practical Observation and Select Cases</span> in 1822, and <span class="italic">An Address to Medical and Surgical Pupils on the Studies and Duties of their Profession</span> in 1839. Barlow died at his home, Spring House, Blackburn, on 20 August 1839 and was buried in Blackburn parish church; no tombstone exists. Some manuscript material of Barlow's exists at Blackburn Library and two of his portraits and a miniature at Blackburn Art Gallery. Copies of the portraits are also held at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, London.<br>
