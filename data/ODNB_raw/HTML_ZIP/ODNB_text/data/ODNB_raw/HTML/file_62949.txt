<span class="headword">&Oacute; Tuama,  Se&aacute;n</span> <span class="st"> [John O'Tuomey]</span>  (1708&#150;1775), <span class="occ">Irish-language poet</span>, born at Baile an Fhantaigh, near Kilmallock, co. Limerick, was probably educated in a local hedge-school, which specialized in preparing young men for the priesthood. The curriculum would have consisted largely of Latin, with some Greek and Hebrew, together with English, science, and geography. He was also trained in Gaelic in a part of the country where there was vibrant scribal and poetic activity.<br>
<br>&Oacute; Tuama became a teacher in Croom, co. Limerick, about 1734, probably at the behest of Father Niocl&aacute;s &Oacute; D&oacute;naill, a Franciscan, and former president of the Irish College at Leuven. &Oacute; Tuama's school was well regarded, as he had the sons of some local landlords among his pupils. &Oacute; Tuama, who was styled <i>an Ghrinn</i> (&#145;the Fun-Loving&#146;) because of his self-confessed love of song and carousing in convivial company, also established a tavern in Croom, where he proclaimed that customers of a Gaelic inclination were welcome, whether or not they had the capacity to pay. His wife, Muirinn, frowned upon such largess and tried to prevent it, but it appears that the enterprise was never a financial success. The tavern became a meeting place or &#145;court&#146; for many poets and literati in the region, who convened to compose and judge verse on prescribed themes. Unanimously acknowledged as chief among them was Se&aacute;n Cl&aacute;rach Mac D&oacute;naill, whose visit to Croom, probably in 1735, was celebrated in verse by Father &Oacute; D&oacute;naill, by &Oacute; Tuama, and by Aindrias Mac Craith, <i>an Mangaire S&uacute;gach</i> (&#145;the Merry Pedlar&#146;, a sobriquet bestowed by &Oacute; Tuama), his close friend and fellow poet, with whom &Oacute; Tuama's career is inextricably linked. They were born in the same townland and Mac Craith arrived in Croom shortly after &Oacute; Tuama, perhaps to replace or assist him in the school. The two had a bitter falling-out about 1750. Thus began a poetic dispute in which each satirized the other with scurrilous verse. The reasons for the quarrel are not clear but there has been speculation that Mac Craith's drinking was a major contributing factor.<br>
<br>Aside from occasional verse, elegy, and the praise of patrons, the major preoccupations in &Oacute; Tuama's poetry are hatred of the English hegemony, the poor state of the Catholic religion, and, concurrently, a fiercely anti-protestant, Jacobite vein. One set of poems by members of the group satirizes Donnchadh &Oacute; h&Eacute;adrom&aacute;in (Hederman), a Dominican monk who converted to protestantism in 1736. The invasion of Britain in 1745 by the Young Pretender (Charles Edward Stuart) was a major event, and &Oacute; Tuama composed a number of poems about it. Another poem from this period bitterly attacks a certain P&iacute;otar (Peter) and four others of Gaelic origin who enlisted on the side of the state against the Pretender. The intriguing cross-dressing figure of Se&aacute;n or Seon Anna Pr&iacute;or, provided the amusing theme for other verses, the earliest dating perhaps from 1743. The Maigue poets, as they were known, also used the <i>bar&aacute;ntas</i> (&#145;warrant&#146;) form, a mixture of prose and verse imitating certain legal terminology, an extension of metaphor of their poetic conclave as &#145;court&#146;. The metaphor may also be read as a muted challenge to the oppressive legal regime of the time. Often the poet's theme was personal, such as the death of an Preabaire (Dasher), the favourite horse of Father Niocl&aacute;s &Oacute; D&oacute;naill. Even these verses, however, as well as lamenting the loss of the beloved animal, also contain political and religious commentary. &Oacute; Tuama moved to Mungret Gate near Limerick city in 1769 where he died on 30 August 1775. His remains were returned for burial in Croom churchyard. A headstone erected by his grandson and inscribed with his name and dates marks his grave.<br>
