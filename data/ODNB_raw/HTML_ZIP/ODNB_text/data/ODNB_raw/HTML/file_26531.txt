<span class="headword">Stirling, Sir  James</span>, first baronet  (1740&#150;1805), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 26 January 1740 in Edinburgh, the eldest of seven children of an Edinburgh merchant, Alexander Stirling, and his wife, Jean Moir (1715/16&#150;1810). Early in life he travelled to the West Indies as clerk to Archibald Stirling of Keir, a planter in Jamaica. The anecdotal biography of Stirling in <span class="italic">Kay's Edinburgh Portraits</span> is the sole account of these early years, but it is confused in some of its details. It tells how Stirling became secretary to the governor, Sir Charles Dalling (presumably Sir John Dalling), though Stirling appears to have returned to Scotland before Dalling ever became governor. Certainly Stirling was well enough set up that on his return to Edinburgh he became a partner in the banking house of Mansfield, Ramsay &amp; Co. He married on 16 August 1772 Alison Mansfield (1749/50&#150;1823), youngest daughter of his business partner James Mansfield. The couple had three sons, two of whom died in infancy, and two daughters. Stirling purchased the estate of Garrieve or Gartlochs, in the parish of New Cumnock, Ayrshire, and changed its name to Mansfield.<br>
<br>Stirling first entered the Edinburgh town council in 1771, serving as treasurer in 1773&#150;4. In 1790 he became lord provost for the first of three terms (1790&#150;92, 1794&#150;6, 1798&#150;1800). His role in the popular riots of 1792, in which he supported the robust measures taken to quell discontent, earned him the odium of the public but the gratitude of a government that rewarded him with a baronetcy on 19 July 1792. He later redeemed himself somewhat in popular estimation by his actions in seeking protection for Scottish shipping, through convoys, when they were at risk from French and Dutch privateers.<br>
<br>Stirling died at his home in Queen Street, Edinburgh, on 17 February 1805, aged sixty-five, and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard.<blockquote>In private life, he was very much respected: of mild, gentlemanly manners, but firm in what he judged to be right. His habits were economical, but not parsimonious; and the party entertainments given at his house were always in a style of magnificence. In person, he was tall and extremely attenuated. (Paterson and Maidment, 251)</blockquote>
