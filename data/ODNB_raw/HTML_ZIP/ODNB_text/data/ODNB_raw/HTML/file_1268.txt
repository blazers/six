<span class="headword">Bancroft,  Edward Nathaniel</span>  (1772&#150;1842), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1267/', "Edward Bancroft (1744&#150;1821)")</script>, American spy and writer on natural history, and Penelope Fellows, was born in London and received his schooling under Dr Charles Burney and Dr Samuel Parr. He was entered at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1789, and graduated BM in 1794. In 1795 he was appointed a physician to the forces. Bancroft served in the Windward Islands, in Portugal, in the Mediterranean, and with Abercromby's expedition to Egypt in 1801. On his return to England he proceeded MD at Cambridge, in 1804, and began to practise as a physician in London, retaining half-pay rank in the army. He joined the Royal College of Physicians in 1805, became a fellow in 1806 and in the same year was appointed to give the Goulstonian lectures, and was made a censor in 1808, at the comparatively early age of thirty-six.<br>
<br>At this time Bancroft wrote two polemical pamphlets: <span class="italic">A letter to the commissioners of military enquiry, containing animadversions on some parts of their fifth report</span> (1808) and <span class="italic">Exposure of misrepresentations by Dr McGrigor and Dr Jackson to the commissioners of military enquiry</span> (1808). Both publications addressed proposed changes in the army medical department, specifically in the distinctions between physician to the forces and regimental surgeon. Bancroft argued for the precedence of the former in the military-medical hierarchy, because &#145;for one officer or soldier who is likely to want the aid of a surgeon, 20 may be expected to want that of a physician&#146;  (Bancroft, <span class="italic">Letter</span>, 1808). His opponents in the controversy were two army medical officers holding Scottish degrees, James McGrigor (afterwards created baronet, and director-general of the army medical department) and Robert Jackson. McGrigor charged Bancroft with lack of accuracy and candour, and with partiality. Jackson accused him of being &#145;presumptuous in his professional rank, which he conceives to be superior to actual knowledge&#146;  (Jackson). Bancroft wanted the best physicians admitted to the military and he believed that they could be drawn from civilian circles, not simply from the lower ranks (of regimental surgeons) of the military-medical hierarchy. Civilian physicians, he argued, had more experience in medical matters generally, and were therefore better equipped to be admitted to the upper military-medical ranks than regimental surgeons.<br>
<br>During this year of great disagreement with colleagues, Bancroft was appointed a physician to St George's Hospital. In 1811, however, he gave up his practice in London owing to ill health, but not before publishing his most memorable and well-received work, <span class="italic">An essay on the disease called yellow fever, with observations concerning febrile contagion, typhus fever, dysentery, and the plague, partly delivered as the Gulstonian lectures before the College of Physicians in the years 1806 and 1807</span> (1811), a <span class="italic">Sequel</span> to which was published in 1817. Although Bancroft's <span class="italic">Essay</span> mistakenly associated the development of yellow fever with malarious conditions, this conclusion was none the less adopted by contemporaries largely because of the author's skill in explaining away entire sets of facts vouched for by authorities such as Sir John Pringle, Donald Marvo, and Sir Gilbert Blane.<br>
<br>In 1811, Bancroft resumed his full-pay rank as physician to the forces and proceeded to Jamaica. He remained there until his death on 18 September 1842 in Kingston. After his death the physicians and surgeons of Jamaica placed a mural tablet to Bancroft's memory in the cathedral church of Kingston, commemorating his &#145;acute and accurate reasoning&#146; and his keen ability &#145;as a polemical writer&#146; to &#145;form the facts or arguments of an antagonist against himself&#146;  (Munk, <span class="italic">Roll</span>, 1818, 68).<br>
