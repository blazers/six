<span class="headword">MacGill <span class="st"> [Mackgill]</span>,  James, of Nether Rankeillour</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1579), <span class="occ">lawyer and administrator</span>, was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of James MacGill, a substantial Edinburgh merchant who was treasurer of the burgh in 1532&#150;3 and 1545&#150;6 and a bailie in 1549&#150;50; and Helen Wardlaw of Torrie, in Fife. His father feued part of the common muir in 1537 and lands at Liberton, to the south of the burgh, in 1538; there is no evidence, however, to support claims that he was knighted and made lord provost of Edinburgh in the reign of James V. The younger James was educated at the University of St Andrews, where he matriculated at the &#145;Protestant well&#146; of St Leonard's College in 1532. It is likely that after graduating he studied abroad, like many other law students. He was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 1 March 1550. On 4 March 1554 he was confirmed in possession of the lands of Nether Rankeillour, Fife.<br>
<br>On 25 June 1554, two months after parliament ratified the appointment of Mary of Guise-Lorraine as regent, MacGill became clerk register, succeeding Thomas Marjoribanks, originally a client of Cardinal David Beaton; on 20 August following he was made an ordinary lord of session. His wife, Janet Adamson, daughter of William Adamson of Craigrook and Janet, daughter of Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston, was one of John Knox's &#145;dear sisters of Edinburgh&#146;. Knox wrote to her from Lyons, probably in 1557. She came of a prominent Edinburgh family. Her father was on the town council&#151;a bailie and dean of guild a number of times between 1527 and 1545&#151;and her brother William Adamson was entered a burgess in 1542 and became one of the small circle of protestants in the capital in the early 1540s; William married Agnes, younger sister of John Bellenden of Auchnoull, who succeeded his father, Thomas, as justice clerk in 1547. The careers of these two crown servants, MacGill and Bellenden, both drawn from the close-knit Edinburgh establishment, were to shadow each other closely in the 1560s and early 1570s. Between October 1556 and September 1558 MacGill was one of the group of lawyers appointed presidents of the burgh, who could preside over the town council in the absence of the lord provost. He was also one of the trio of well-qualified lawyers appointed to advise the executors of the estate of Robert Reid, bishop of Orkney, who on his death in 1558 left an endowment to found a college in Edinburgh. He was one of the commissioners who negotiated the Anglo-Scottish treaty of Upsettlington (or Ladykirk) in May 1559.<br>
<br>Although it has been alleged that MacGill, like William Maitland of Lethington, threw his lot in with the lords of the congregation late in 1559, there is no evidence to substantiate this. Knox testifies that their friendship began only late in 1560. Yet it is likely that MacGill would by reason of his office have been involved with the organization of the Reformation parliament of August 1560. He first made contact with the English agent Thomas Randolph in the following month. It is clear that MacGill, in common with the other major office-holders of the crown, survived the revolution of 1559&#150;60 and remained in royal service. He was confirmed as clerk register and appointed to the privy council on the return from France of Queen Mary in August 1561. In the controversy among the reformers which followed the queen's return, when the Catholic mass was said in her private chapel in Holyroodhouse, a debate was held in MacGill's house in Edinburgh in November 1561. MacGill was one of the six privy councillors present who unanimously defended the arrangement, in the teeth of opposition from Knox and other leading ministers. That meeting was recalled by MacGill in the better-known debate between Knox and Lethington in the general assembly of June 1564.<br>
<br>MacGill's prominence in this period is confirmed by his service on a commission, including Lethington and the earls of Moray and Morton, which devised the compromise settlement for ministers of the new church known as the thirds of benefices and approved by the privy council on 22 December 1561 though denounced by Knox. MacGill was also a member of the subsequent commission set up on 24 January 1562 which scrutinized the rentals of benefices and determined stipends of individual ministers. In August 1562 he accompanied the queen, Moray, and the bulk of the privy council on their progress to the north, which ended with the defeat and death of George Gordon, fourth earl of Huntly at Corrichie. In December 1563 MacGill again tried to act as a go-between, arranging a meeting between Knox, Moray, and Lethington at his house. By the time of the meeting of the general assembly in June 1564, however, he was firmly classed by Knox as belonging to the &#145;courtiers&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, 2.102).<br>
<br>MacGill was not involved in Moray's rebellion in the autumn of 1565 but fled the capital on 18 March 1566, along with Bellenden and Alexander Guthrie, town clerk of Edinburgh, nine days after the murder of the queen's servant David Riccio. He was declared a rebel and deprived of his office, which was given to James Balfour of Pittendreich. His rehabilitation as early as June 1566 suggests that he may have been only marginally involved in the Riccio affair. He was nevertheless singled out by the bishop of Mondovi as &#145;a man of no family and contriver of all evil&#146; who needed to be eliminated  (Pollen, 278). By 1567 he was back in the queen's service, and he sat on the assize which exonerated Bothwell from involvement in the murder of Darnley. By June 1567 he had joined the confederate lords who confronted the queen and Bothwell in the field at Carberry, and after Mary was deposed he became part of the hard core of confederates who emerged as the king's party. He and Sir James Melville were chosen to represent this faction in offering the regency to Moray when he reached Berwick early in August.<br>
<br>In December 1567 MacGill was restored as clerk register by the new regent. His shifting allegiances in this period provoked an angry reaction in the Marian proclamation issued after the queen's escape from Lochleven in May 1568: he and Henry Balnaves of Halhill were condemned as &#145;oppin traitouris&#146; and &#145;airis [heirs] to Judas&#146;  (Pollen, 273). Both were to be part of the formidable galaxy of intellectual and legal talent, which also included Lethington and George Buchanan, assembled by Moray to argue the case against Mary in her first trial at York in September 1568. After the York conference MacGill and Lethington were chosen for a special audience with Elizabeth; some later sources, including Calderwood, saw MacGill as the secretary's minder rather than his colleague. The divisions opening up both within Moray's administration and among the king's men as a whole over the treatment of the queen came to a head in a convention, held at Perth in July 1569, over the issue of whether to press for her divorce, an eventuality which might have made her restoration a possibility. Within the administration Bellenden and MacGill were resolutely opposed to this proposal, whereas Lethington and Sir William Murray of Tullibardine, the comptroller, favoured it. The debate was heated and acrimonious. MacGill was later one of the king's men singled out for ridicule in a series of propaganda pieces written by John and Thomas Maitland, the secretary's brothers. The assassination of Moray six months later confirmed these splits. Within a week of the murder MacGill and Morton represented the king's lords at a meeting with English commissioners in Edinburgh, at which they promised the continuance of the &#145;amity&#146; in return for English military aid and support for Lennox's selection as regent. In March 1571 MacGill accompanied Morton on a mission to England, to ensure the continuing custody of Queen Mary.<br>
<br>Against this background of difficulties for the king's party MacGill had been appointed lord provost of Edinburgh in October 1570, at the head of a council of king's men. That body was dismissed and exiled from the burgh in June 1571, but it set up a rival administration in the nearby port of Leith. MacGill seems to have been singled out for rough treatment by the Marians in the town. Many of his goods and valuables, which he was attempting to move to safety at Pinkie, were intercepted by a Marian force from the castle in May 1571. He and his son David, also a lawyer and Edinburgh burgess, were forfeited by a Marian parliament in June 1571, and two of his houses as well as that of his son in the town were demolished by the notorious Captain of the Chimneys in 1572.<br>
<br>Throughout this period, in which the Leith exiles became the most militant element among the king's men, MacGill remained provost. He supervised a campaign of ruthless retribution, inflicted on more than 450 Marian sympathizers in Edinburgh through both the kirk session and the law courts after the exiles returned to the capital in July 1572 and displaced the Marian town council. He continued as a regular attender of meetings of the privy council throughout the period of Morton's regency (1572&#150;8). After the temporary fall of Morton in March 1578, MacGill was confirmed as clerk register and charged, along with George Buchanan, with managing affairs until the next meeting of parliament. Ever the survivor, he continued on the privy council after Morton's rehabilitation. He died in Edinburgh on 16 October 1579.<br>
<br>With his wife, Janet Adamson, MacGill had five sons and two daughters. The eldest son was James MacGill of Rankeillour, from whom descended the MacGills, viscounts of Oxfurd. The elder James MacGill's brother was <a name="cosubject_69927"></a><span class="headword">David MacGill of Cranstoun Riddel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1595), also a graduate and prominent <span class="occ">lawyer</span>. He was made a burgess and guild of Edinburgh <i>gratis</i> by right of his father on 25 September 1555, became a lord of session, and was made a king's advocate in 1582. As early as 1565 his tax assessment showed him to be among the wealthiest ten lawyers in the capital. The MacGill brothers both appeared on a protestant subscription list of 1562 for a poor hospital in the capital. But David MacGill was condemned by the radical minister and diarist James Melville for his &#145;contempt of the ministrie&#146;, and when he died in February 1595, after a long illness, both Andrew and James Melville were present, to witness a death-bed repentance for his years &#145;without all sense of God&#146;  (Melville, 135). David MacGill married twice. With his first wife, Elizabeth Forrester of Corstorphine, he had six sons and two daughters. His eldest son, also David MacGill of Cranstoun Riddel, followed his father in making his career in the law. He became a lord of session and was made a privy councillor in 1603, but died young in 1607. Elizabeth died on 16 March 1579, and her husband then married Isobel Cunningham, who survived him.<br>
