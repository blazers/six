<span class="headword">Wright,  William Valentine</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1826, <em>d.</em> 1877), <span class="occ">soap manufacturer and wholesale druggist</span>, was baptized on 26 February 1826 at St Peter and St Paul's parish church, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, the son of William Wright, builder and carpenter, and his wife, Susannah. His middle name suggests that he was born on 14 February.<br>
<br>Following apprenticeship to the drug trade with Messrs Grimwade, Ridley &amp; Co. of Ipswich, he went to London and was an assistant at the pharmacy of John Bell &amp; Co. in Oxford Street. He remained there until 1848, when he obtained a partnership with an elderly druggist, James Curtis, in the latter's premises at 11 Old Fish Street Hill. On 6 March 1849, at Wivenhoe parish church, Essex, Wright married Elizabeth Mustard, a young woman of his own age born in nearby Great Bentley. The couple had nine children, five daughters and four sons, and by 1871 the family was living at Alde House, Thornton Road, Clapham, together with a niece, a cook, and a maid. James Curtis retired soon after Wright's marriage, and Wright continued alone until 1860, when he was joined by G. B. Francis, a former assistant with him at Bells.<br>
<br>Wright lived at just the right time to take advantage of the burgeoning soap industry of the nineteenth century, which had grown in response to the demands of an expanding population. The smoke and grime of industrial towns made soap for their inhabitants a necessity, instead of a luxury, as it had earlier been. And as the standard of living of city dwellers rose from 1860, a huge potential market for soap was created, first among the middle classes, then among the industrial workers.<br>
<br>Wright did more than simply make soap. By this time he was making and selling a liquid coal-tar solution, calling it Wright's Liquor Carbonis Detergens. He marketed a product that not only cleaned, as all soaps did, but also cleansed: this soap could be used not simply for washing but also for treating the skin. Doctors noted its antiseptic properties, especially in treating skin diseases, and it quickly became a standard remedy. Wright sought to bring it to a wider public, and eventually succeeded in incorporating it in a soap base. Thus, about 1866, Wright's Coal Tar Soap was born. Meanwhile in 1863 the City of London corporation had purchased Wright's premises for road improvements. Using the compensation money for disturbance, Wright moved the business in 1867 to new premises in Southwark.<br>
<br>Wright met an untimely death when travelling with his son Charles in Dundee. Inflammation in the face developed into erysipelas, and on 17 September 1877 he died at the Royal Hotel, Nethergate, Dundee, aged fifty-two. He was survived by his wife who retained her interest in the business until she sold it in 1892. Although Wright pioneered the manufacture of coal-tar soap, it was left to his son, William Valentine jun., to take over the business after his death and actively promote the new product. It did not really become popular outside medical circles until 1892, however, when the firm made radical changes in the methods of manufacturing soap and adopted a milling process in place of the former melting method.<br>
