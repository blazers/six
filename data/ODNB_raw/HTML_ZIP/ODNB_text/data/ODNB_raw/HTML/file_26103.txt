<span class="headword">Spelman <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Yallop]</span>,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1767), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was the son of Charles Yallop (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1736), gentleman, of Bowthorpe Hall, Norfolk, and his wife, Ellen Barkham. Some indication of his reasons for rejecting his father's surname and adopting that of his great-grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26102/', "Clement Spelman (bap. 1598, d. 1679)")</script> can be gleaned from a manuscript diary, &#145;Annales miserarium&#146; (1724). The diary details his incarceration for non-payment of a &pound;5000 mortgage. His exiled father, who had contracted the debt, was forced to send the conveyance for the Yallop estates from Rotterdam. Having cleared the mortgage, Spelman settled &pound;100 a year on Jenny, the mother of his natural daughter, and &pound;150 on his disgraced father, Charles. The diary also records, in salacious Latin, Edward's Boswell-like adventures among the prostitutes and drinking-dens of London, and, in French, his plans to flee to France if the mortgager Naish proceeded with the suit.<br>
<br>There is no record of Spelman having spent time at university&#151;his literary executor remembered him once shouting: &#145;Good God! doth any fellow of a college know anything of Greek?&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)&#151;but the classical scholarship for which he is remembered was formidable. In 1742 Spelman published <span class="italic">The Expedition of Cyrus</span>, his translation of Xenophon's <span class="italic">Anabasis</span>. Pope was then making the final revisions of his <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, and Spelman attacked those &#145;paraphrasers&#146; who &#145;find less Difficulty in clothing modern Thoughts in a modern Dress, than in making Those of an Ancient appear graceful&#146;. Edward Gibbon, who had a copy of the <span class="italic">Expedition</span> with him in Lausanne, testified to Spelman's own success in this respect, as does the fact of the <span class="italic">Expedition</span>'s remaining in print until 1849.<br>
<br>During the following year Spelman published <span class="italic">A Fragment out of the Sixth Book of Polybius</span>. He intended to parallel the balanced, tripartite constitution of Rome described by Polybius with that of modern Britain. The <span class="italic">Fragment</span> includes an introduction demanding the repeal of the <span class="roman">Septennial Act</span>, &#145;the severest Stab the liberties of the People of England ever received&#146;, and an appended &#145;Dissertation&#146; on the constitution (as opposed to the powers) of the Roman senate. An indication of the volume's high reputation is that Nathaniel Hooke condescended to attack its historiography in his <span class="italic">Observations</span> (1758). It was thus measured against the writings of Hooke's other authoritative targets: Vertot, Lord Hervey, Thomas Chapman, and Conyers Middleton, whose hugely successful <span class="italic">Life of Cicero</span> had originally inspired Spelman's adaptation of Polybius.<br>
<br>Spelman proved a reluctant controversialist in <span class="italic">A Short Review of Mr. Hooke's &#145;Observations&#146;</span> (1758), which replied to Hooke's main charge: that not one of the above five writers had produced reliable evidence for their shared assumption that the early Roman senates were elected by a democratic vote. Spelman was then completing a translation of <span class="italic">The Roman Antiquities of Dionysus Halicarnassensis</span>, due to be published in four sumptuous volumes later in 1758. Since Dionysus was the authority that Hooke deemed unreliable and sophistic, both past and future publications required defence. Spelman emphasized the obvious point that Hooke had rejected Dionysus's account &#145;because his political principles (no more to be concealed than the itch, though very luckily they are not so catching) lead him to look upon the appointment of a senate to be the dismembering of his darling prerogative&#146;. Spelman was in turn answered by William Bowyer the younger, whose <span class="italic">Apology</span> for Hooke was published posthumously in 1783.<br>
<br>Even before his controversy with Hooke, Spelman had settled on the remnants of his family estates near East Acre, Norfolk. He had started building High House, at West Acre, before 1756, and great attention to the details of its construction is evident in his correspondence with Sir William Browne. This project must have exhausted his already diminished income, since Spelman sold the entire estate to Richard Hammond in 1761, on condition of his being allowed to remain at High House. He died there, unmarried, on 12 March 1767, and was buried at the Barkham vault in East Acre church. During his last years Spelman began <span class="italic">The History of the Civil War between York and Lancaster</span> (1792), which was completed by G. W. Lemon. The editor's press-copy of this book, interleaved with voluminous manuscript notes and corrections, is in the Bodleian Library. Lemon also published the last fruits of Spelman's scholarship, a tract on Greek accents, in 1773.<br>
