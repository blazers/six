</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coningham, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1895&#150;1948), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born in Brisbane, Australia, on 19 January 1895, the eldest of the three children of Arthur Coningham (1863&#150;1939), variously a chemist, tobacconist, bookmaker, and book salesman, who played cricket once for Australia against England, in 1894&#150;5, and his wife, Alice Stamford Dowling (1869&#150;1959), who emigrated to Australia from Devon in 1885. The family fled to New Zealand following two widely publicized trials in Sydney in 1900 and 1901; the first jury failed to agree, but the second acquitted a Catholic priest of the Coninghams' charge that he had fathered Alice's second child.<br>
<br>After two years at Wellington College, New Zealand (1909&#150;10), where he excelled only at shooting, Coningham worked as a general hand on sheep farms. He enlisted in the 5th Wellington regiment on 10 August 1914 and took part in an expedition that captured German Samoa on the 29th. Following his return to Wellington in April 1915 he joined the Canterbury mounted rifles, sailed with the 4th reinforcements on the 17th, and arrived at Anzac Cove early in June. His health, undermined in Samoa, collapsed: sunstroke, dysentery, and typhoid put him in hospital until September, when he was sent home and discharged, unfit for further service, in March 1916.<br>
<br>During April, however, Coningham sailed for England at his own expense and in August was admitted to the Royal Flying Corps, commissioned as a second lieutenant, and taught to fly. He graduated from the Central Flying School (CFS) at Upavon on 25 November 1916 and joined 32 squadron on the western front in December. He now became known as Mary, a nickname worn down from the original Maori (then thought suitable for any New Zealander) and made sure his friends used it; except officially, he never again answered to Arthur.<br>
<br>After seven months of intense activity, earning promotion to captain and two decorations (DSO, MC), Coningham was invalided back to England in August 1917 and spent three months in hospital, suffering from &#145;stress of service&#146;. He returned to the western front in command of 92 squadron in July 1918. At the armistice he had flown 176 patrols, personally destroyed nine enemy aircraft, shared in the destruction of four, damaged at least four, and driven away scores.<br>
<br>Coningham was awarded a DFC in June 1919 and granted a permanent commission as a flight lieutenant in August. His flying skills were displayed at the RAF's first aerial pageant at Hendon in July 1920, and in October he returned as an instructor to the CFS, Upavon. He again performed brilliantly at Hendon in 1921. In February 1922 he went to Mosul, Iraq, to join 55 squadron, of which he took command in July 1923, on his promotion to squadron leader. In February 1924 he arrived in Cairo to undertake air staff duties. By 1925 interest was growing in the possibility of opening up Africa to civil aviation. On Air Ministry orders Coningham therefore led three DH 9a two-seater biplanes from Helwan (near Cairo) to Kaduna in Nigeria and back during October and November&#151;a round trip of about 6500 miles. He was awarded an AFC on 1 January 1926 to mark the first east&#150;west crossing of Africa by air. The value of that route for sending aircraft to Cairo from Britain and the United States would be fully realized during the Second World War.<br>
<br>In December 1926 Coningham was appointed a squadron commander at the Cadet College, Cranwell. From there he returned again to the CFS (now at Wittering, near Stamford) in July 1930, this time as deputy commandant. Promoted wing commander in July 1931 he was sent to Khartoum as senior airman at Sudan defence force headquarters. He married Nancy (Nan) Muriel Brooks (1903&#150;1985) in Alexandria in July 1932, six months after the death of her first husband, Sir Howard Frank (1872&#150;1932), the head of a famous property-dealing company. She had two sons from her first marriage and one daughter from her second. Coningham returned to England in March 1935 and spent four years in Coastal Area (Command from July 1936) in various appointments around Southampton Water and was promoted to group captain in January 1937.<br>
<br>In July 1939 Coningham took command as an air commodore in York of 4 group, Bomber Command. He began the task of converting a nominal weapon (five squadrons of men untrained in night operations, flying inadequate Whitley bombers) into one that might become a dangerous weapon. Promoted again, to air vice-marshal in September 1940, his future as a &#145;bomber baron&#146; seemed assured by July 1941, as his group enlarged and its training and equipment improved.<br>
<br>At that very moment, Coningham was whisked off to Cairo to command 204 group, at the request of Air Marshal Tedder, the newly appointed head of Middle East air command. Notice of his appointment as CB (for Bomber Command service) followed him, and in September he set up his first joint headquarters when the Eighth Army was formed. In October 204 group became the western desert air force, to match that army's status.<br>
<br>Coningham came to be regarded by Tedder (in Liddell Hart's words) as &#145;the real hero&#146; of the desert war. His powers of inspiration, his tactical awareness (emphasizing the need to win air superiority before attempting close co-operation with ground forces), and his ability to act sensibly in numerous crises also attracted the admiration of senior American airmen, especially during the Tunisian campaign (November 1942 &#150; May 1943). But he had no grasp of logistics&#151;the science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of forces&#151;so Tedder provided him in February 1942 with an able assistant in Air Commodore Thomas Elmhirst. Supported in Cairo by experts handling specific problems, the whole organization was presided over by Tedder, who had the ear in London of two officers whom Churchill respected: Sir Charles Portal (chief of the air staff) and Sir Wilfrid Freeman (his vice-chief).<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Coningham and General Montgomery (appointed to command the Eighth Army in August 1942) became estranged in November over what seemed to airmen the army's tardy pursuit of Rommel after the battle of El Alamein. Personal relations between Coningham (supported by Tedder) and Montgomery worsened, but all three usually agreed on the basic issue that air power must be independent of army (or navy) control&#151;an issue that divided commanders in all services and on all sides throughout the war.<br>
<br>Coningham was knighted (KCB) in November 1942. Having been promoted air marshal in February 1943 he was appointed to command British and American tactical air forces in Tunisia under the direction of an American airman (General Spaatz), who was, in turn, directed by Tedder as head of Mediterranean air command; all of them were subordinate to General Eisenhower as supreme allied commander. During 1943 he established himself as a key member of the Anglo-American team which achieved victory in Tunisia, conquered Sicily, and successfully invaded Italy. He returned to England in January 1944.<br>
<br>As head of the 2nd Tactical Air Force, Coningham was part of an even larger allied team, led by Eisenhower with Tedder as his deputy, charged to liberate occupied Europe and destroy Nazi Germany. The stakes were high, the options various, the enemy cunning, and the commanders forceful men, used to obedience. Among the ensuing quarrels, that which caused Coningham's exclusion from the planning and execution of the Arnhem operation (September 1944) led to an avoidable disaster. Although the allied commanders co-operated more than they quarrelled, notably during Hitler's Ardennes offensive (December 1944), which caught them all off guard, it may have been as well that their resources were abundant and that by 1944 the Soviet Union had gravely weakened German power.<br>
<br>Away from the debating table, Coningham recognized that the fight for air superiority, his first priority, was in fact his least worry. He had many experienced combat pilots, but few who were skilled in ground attack. That role, he foresaw, would become a constant task all the way from Normandy to Berlin, and squadrons must be equipped and trained&#151;as in his earlier campaigns&#151;to move forward rapidly.<br>
<br>In July 1945 Coningham received the DSM, an American decoration, was appointed head of Flying Training Command, and elected commodore of the RAF yacht club. He spent three weeks in the United States in September as guest of the United States Army Air Forces. He was knighted again (KBE) in January 1946 and granted the freedom of Brussels, his favourite city, in April. Although he was required to retire in August 1947, the Air Ministry accepted his plea that it be officially recorded that he left the RAF at his own request. Coningham died early on 30 January 1948, when an Avro Tudor IV airliner named <i>Star Tiger</i>, in which he was travelling as a passenger to Havana, Cuba, crashed into the sea north-east of Bermuda.<br>
<br>A big, handsome man, Coningham loved company, gossip, dancing, and parties that went on until morning, although he never smoked and drank little. An outstanding pilot and navigator, he also excelled at polo, sailing, and shooting, though never at cricket. A superb combat record enhanced a natural talent for leadership, never more evident than when danger threatened; his determination to reach high rank was less evident.<br>
