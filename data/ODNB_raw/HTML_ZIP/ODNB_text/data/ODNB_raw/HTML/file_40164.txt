<span class="headword">Morris,  (John) Marcus Harston</span>  (1915&#150;1989), <span class="occ">magazine editor and publisher</span>, was born on 25 April 1915 in Preston, Lancashire, the second child and eldest of three sons, the youngest of whom died in childhood, of the Revd Walter Edmund Harston Morris and his wife, Edith Nield. In 1918 his parents moved to Southport. He was educated at Dean Close School in Cheltenham and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1937. He then moved to Wycliffe Hall and gained a second in theology in 1939. A curate from 1939 to 1940 at St Bartholomew's, Roby, he was ordained priest in 1940 and went to Great Yarmouth (1940&#150;41). He was a chaplain in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1941 to 1943 and rector of Weeley thereafter. In 1945 he became vicar of St James's, Birkdale, in Southport, where his talents as a Christian publicist were shown in a unique magazine, <span class="italic">Anvil</span>, which circulated far beyond the parish.<br>
<br>In 1948 Morris engaged a young artist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31192/', "Frank Hampson")</script>, to work first on <span class="italic">Anvil</span> and by 1949 on a new project, a strip cartoon magazine for boys. Morris saw clearly that boys were buying horror comics, produced for American servicemen of limited intelligence, because they wanted action stories in strip cartoon form, and not because they wanted pictures of savage sexual assaults on busty women. Hampson turned out to be a great strip cartoon artist, devising his own stories and characters and inventing spaceships and futuristic gadgets. He devised a cartoon about Dan Dare, space pilot, and he and Morris sent the dummy of a new paper, <span class="italic">Eagle</span>, to publishers. In October 1949 the dummy was bought by Hulton Press, which employed Morris and Hampson.<br>
<br>After unprecedented publicity, the first issue of <span class="italic">Eagle</span> went on sale on 14 April 1950 and was an immediate success. It was printed on good paper in four-colour rotogravure, on presses built by Eric Bemrose of Liverpool. The stories boys wanted, and features they did not know they wanted until they had them, such as adventures of Christian heroes (these last proved fifth in popularity), were told in strip cartoon form. The depiction of historical scenes and clothing had to be accurate and the science in Dan Dare, space pilot of the future, must be beyond criticism: Hampson could invent what did not yet exist, provided there was no reason why it should not, but Dan must never do anything impossible, such as travelling at more than the speed of light.<br>
<br>The Morris family moved to Epsom in 1950 and Hampson's team was given a studio in the house. Although many girls read <span class="italic">Eagle</span>, the majority wanted their own paper; <span class="italic">Girl</span> appeared in November 1951, to be followed in January 1953 by <span class="italic">Robin</span> (to teach smaller children to read), and in March 1954 <span class="italic">Swift</span> bridged the gap to the papers for older readers. The popularity of these magazines was not weakened by the fact that parents and teachers approved of them. They gave rise to annuals, the Eagle Club, and other expressions of belonging, including carol services, which filled St Paul's and other cathedrals. Morris dressed as a parson only for these events. His brilliance as an editor was recognized when Edward Hulton made him managing editor of <span class="italic">Housewife</span> in 1954, a post he held until 1959, and included him as a member of the Hulton Press management committee.<br>
<br>Morris left at the end of 1959 to join the National Magazine Company (a subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation of America) as editorial director in 1960. From 1964 until 1982 he was managing director and editor-in-chief. In the 1960s the company published eleven magazines, including <span class="italic">Good Housekeeping</span>, <span class="italic">She</span>, <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span>, and <span class="italic">Connoisseur</span>. In the 1970s Morris bought <span class="italic">Queen</span> and amalgamated it with <span class="italic">Harper's</span>, and launched <span class="italic">Cosmopolitan</span> in Britain. In association with Cond&eacute; Nast he formed COMAG, perhaps the biggest media distribution company in the country. He became deputy chairman of the National Magazine Company in 1979 (the chairman had to be American). He increased the circulation of his company's magazines at a time when other magazines were struggling or going out of business. He retired in 1984. From 1952 to 1983 he was honorary chaplain of St Bride's, Fleet Street.<br>
<br>Morris's nine years at Hulton Press were exceeded in responsibility and success by his twenty-five years at the National Magazine Company, and yet it was for his creation of <span class="italic">Eagle</span> and <span class="italic">Girl</span> and for his powerful influence for good on a whole generation that he is remembered and revered. He was appointed OBE in 1983.<br>
<br>Morris was tall, thin, and fair, and looked like a sardonic Leslie Howard. In 1941 he married Jessica, one of two actress daughters of John Hamlet Dunning, a representative for Clark's shoes. They had a son, who died in a car accident in 1968, and three daughters. Morris, who lived latterly at the Mill House, Midford, Bath, died on 16 March 1989 at the King Edward VII Hospital for Officers, London. His memorial service filled St Bride's in Fleet Street to overflowing.<br>
