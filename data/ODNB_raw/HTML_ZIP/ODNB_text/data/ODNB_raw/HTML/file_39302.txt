<span class="headword">Willyams,  Sarah  Brydges</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sarah  Mendez da Costa]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1863), <span class="occ">heiress and benefactor of Benjamin Disraeli</span>, was the younger daughter of Abraham Mendez da Costa (<i>d</i>. 1782), of Bath, and his wife, Elizabeth Leigh, whom he married in 1775. Sarah was descended from a line of Peninsular&#150;English Jews via Jamaica, where her grandfather Daniel Mendez da Costa settled and made a fortune. She was also heir of her father's only brother, Isaac (<i>d</i>. 1766). Her father was estranged from his relatives because of his marriage; after his death her mother married in 1789 John Ford. In 1794 Sarah married James Brydges Willyams (1771/2&#150;1820), a poet and illustrator, and lieutenant-colonel of the Cornwall militia, eldest son of James Willyams of Carnanton, Cornwall; they had no children.<br>
<br>Mrs Brydges Willyams's interest in Disraeli arose because, like herself, he was a Christian of Jewish parentage. She wrote to him about his books and speeches and in 1851 asked him to be an executor of her will in return for a substantial consideration in it. The voluminous extant correspondence with Disraeli (and with Mrs Disraeli) begins shortly thereafter, in August 1851. In the summer of 1853 the Disraelis paid her the first of ten annual visits at Mount Braddon, her house at Tormoham, Torquay, the Disraelis always staying at a hotel. Thus began the extraordinary friendship between a reclusive elderly provincial gentlewoman and one of the leading politicians of the day; it was marked by generosity and affection on both sides, with a constant exchange of gifts (game, fish, books, newspapers, flowers, pictures, even trees). For Disraeli, the correspondence partially replaced that which he had once had with his sister, and he wrote to Mrs Brydges Willyams at length on affairs both public and domestic. He gave much personal attention to her wishes, most notably in the period 1859&#150;62 with respect to her coat of arms. She responded with grateful and adoring incredulity at his interest in her.<br>
<br>Madame Lionel de Rothschild in December 1862 described<blockquote>the female Croesus, who is likely, or unlikely to leave her wealth to Dizzy. She has piercing black eyes, wears a jet black wig, with an enormous top knot, no crinoline, is quite a miser, starves herself into a skeleton, except when her adored Disraeli is here, is ninety-seven [<i>sic</i>] years of age, keeps neither horses, nor carriages, nor men servants&#151;only an enormous watchdog to protect her and her gold. (Rothschild Archives, RFam C/21)</blockquote>Mrs Brydges Willyams' will (1857) acknowledged Disraeli's &#145;efforts to vindicate the race of Israel&#146;, and requested him to assume additionally the names of Lara and Mendez da Costa, both she and Disraeli (mistakenly) believing themselves to be of similar aristocratic descent. Disraeli did not assume the names, but granted her wish to be buried at Hughenden, Buckinghamshire; when she died, rather suddenly, on 11 November 1863 at Mount Braddon, aged (according to Disraeli) ninety-four years, she was interred in the Disraeli vault. She left an estate sworn at under &pound;40,000, of which Disraeli received over &pound;30,000.<br>
