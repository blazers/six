<span class="headword">Coats,  Thomas</span>  (1809&#150;1883), <span class="occ">thread manufacturer and benefactor</span>, was born at Ferguslie, Paisley, Renfrewshire, on 18 October 1809, the fourth of at least six sons of James Coats (1774&#150;1857), one of the founders of the Paisley thread industry, and Catherine Mitchell (<i>d</i>. 1857). He trained as a textile engineer at Johnstone, near Paisley, and after his father's death became a partner in the family firm with his brothers James (the managing partner) and Peter (in charge of finances); Thomas was production manager (also dealing with technical matters and training). Expansion was continuous, capacity doubling in the 1840s, and again in the 1850s, stimulated by demand from America. After James died in 1845 Thomas became managing partner, and during his tenure the firm became the most important in the world market. By 1860 Coats employed 1100 workers and sold annually over &pound;200,000 worth of thread, 80 per cent in America, where Andrew Coats, a younger brother, lived. To offset the effects of competition and increasing tariffs in the 1860s and 1870s, Coats bought an established company, Conants of Pawtucket (Rhode Island), and greatly expanded its American mills.<br>
<br>Coats's marriage to Margaret, daughter of Thomas Glen, a miller, was a stable and happy relationship; they had six sons and five daughters. In 1872 Coats bought Ferguslie House to accommodate his large family. An active Baptist in Paisley, he made many gifts to Baptist churches. A Liberal in politics, he was chairman of the town's school board (1872&#150;83) and gave &pound;1000 to each of the four local schools; the site for Ferguslie School and the sum of &pound;1000 were also his donations. He made a number of gifts to Paisley: the fountain gardens (1868) and the observatory (1882) were the most significant. He served as chairman of the Philosophical Institution (1862&#150;4) and on the committee of management of the free public library and museum which his brother, Sir Peter, had given to the town in the late 1860s. Thomas Coats was an enthusiastic numismatist, and his vast Scottish coin collection was the basis for Edward Burns's <span class="italic">The coinage of Scotland illustrated from the cabinet of Thomas Coats esquire of Ferguslie and other collections</span> (1887). At a municipal banquet in November 1881 Thomas and Peter Coats were presented with their portraits, painted by Sir Daniel Macnee, president of the Royal Scottish Academy.<br>
<br>At the time of Coats's death the assets of the firm were estimated at over &pound;2 million; it employed about 6000 people, of whom 3000 worked in Paisley; the value of his estate in the UK was &pound;1,308,734 17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. Coats was a great production manager, with outstanding technical knowledge; his management style was gentle and firm; he recognized the significance of quality control and was quick to adopt new ideas and new technology. He was also chairman of Clan Line Association Steamers and a director of the British and African Steam Navigation Company of Glasgow. Survived by his wife, Coats died on 15 October 1883 at Paisley and was buried there. The town square was presented with a statue in his memory, but the most substantial gift was the Thomas Coats Memorial Church, funded by his family in 1894.<br>
