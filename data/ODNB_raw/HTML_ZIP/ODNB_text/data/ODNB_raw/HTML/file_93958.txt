<span class="headword">Phillips,  Andrew Kelvin <span class="st"> [Andy]</span></span>  (1940&#150;2004), <span class="occ">lighting designer</span>, was born on 30 December 1940 at 18 Sydney Road, Cradley Heath, Staffordshire, the son of William Thomas Phillips, Baptist minister, and his wife, Kathleen Angove, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willis. He was educated at Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and then trained as an actor at Florence Moore's studio in Brighton, though he actually wanted to be a writer. As a student he formed his own theatre company, Group One, in 1959 and was subsequently described by the <span class="italic">Brighton Evening Argus</span> as &#145;a handsome twenty-year-old who smokes a good deal and dresses like Marlon Brando&#146;  (quoted in <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Sept 2004). In 1961 the company took two shows to the Edinburgh Festival, where its production of the radical <span class="italic">Fringe of Light</span> by the actor&#150;playwright Bill Owen caused a stir. Phillips's succinct summary of the company's fate was that &#145;it went bust, as they all do&#146;.<br>
<br>The company's debts were taken on by Phillips, who was struck how, in his opinion, the only people making any money from theatre in the late 1950s and early 1960s were the technicians. In 1963 he began work in London as a prop-maker and stagehand, and later that year joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at the Aldwych Theatre, becoming the &#145;young man&#146; electrician working alongside a crew who had served together in the Second World War. There, and on tour with productions like Paul Scofield's <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, he started to learn what he always described as the craft, rather than the art, of lighting. It was Phillips's practical experience that brought him to the attention of the Royal Court Theatre in 1965. Buoyant since the success of <span class="italic">Look Back In Anger</span>, the Royal Court was the home of new British drama. It also became Phillips's home for seven years and would shape his career for the rest of his life. The Royal Court's artistic director, William Gaskill, challenged his new chief electrician to invent a &#145;house style&#146; of lighting. Phillips did exactly this, working with directors including Lindsay Anderson, Bill Bryden, John Dexter, Peter Gill, and Anthony Page, and designers such as Jocelyn Herbert. Starting with the Royal Court's driving principle&#151;subordination to the playwright's words&#151;Phillips subordinated himself to the actors and interpreted his job as supporting them in telling the play's story. As he later remarked, &#145;My job was to light them &hellip; It's a craft that requires a lot of application, experience and patience&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Sept 2004).<br>
<br>The style Phillips created came to be known as &#145;white light&#146;. This rejected what was then the orthodox practice of combining different coloured spotlights and instead used correction filters to remove the warmth of the tungsten light sources. He worked with the set designers, and carefully contrived concealment was swept away; the lighting equipment was left in full view, rigged to reflect the stage design below. Phillips also rejected the established way of working and refused to begin lighting until the actors were on stage. &#145;I'm not lighting the floor or the scenery, I'm lighting six feet above the floor: I'm lighting faces&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Sept 2004). &#145;He told me that he lit the whites of the eyes&#146;, wrote the dramatist Edward Bond after Phillips's death  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 25 Sept 2004). Phillips had complete control of his craft and was able, as John Dexter described, to generate a lighting effect that &#145;defines the space and forces the actors to dominate it. It has a clarity which gives weight to space and has the effect of giving the actors height and structure&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Sept 2004). Bond similarly recalled how Phillips rose to the challenge presented in his play <span class="italic">Lear</span> (1972), in which Lear's eyes are removed. &#145;I wondered what Phillips would do. He seemed to concentrate the light on the hands. Uncannily, I became aware of Lear's fingernails&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 25 Sept 2004).<br>
<br>The Royal Court's schedule&#151;runs of three to six weeks, a show ending on Saturday then the new set and lighting installed overnight in time to start &#145;teching&#146; on Sunday morning&#151;placed great demands on Phillips, who lit eighty consecutive plays. The actress Judy Liebert (<i>b</i>. 1945/6), whom Phillips met in 1969, recalled being &#145;bowled over by this dynamic guy, who always said exactly what he thought and had the stamina of an ox&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 25 Sept 2004); the couple married on 28 November 1969, and had a son, Sam. Phillips left the Royal Court in 1972, but continued to work with the theatre's collaborators, most notably the director John Dexter; Phillips's two Tony award nominations in New York came from shows with Dexter, <span class="italic">Equus</span> in 1974, and <span class="italic">M. Butterfly</span> in 1988 (the latter lit in intensely monochromatic deep colours, quite belying his white light tag). During the 1970s he co-founded a lighting supply company named, inevitably, White Light. He was divorced in 1974 and began a seven-year relationship with the actress Glenda Jackson (<i>b.</i> 1936), whom he met on an RSC production of <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span> (1975), which he lit and in which she starred.<br>
<br>Phillips was well known in the theatre for his strong opinions and contrariness, as well as his search for perfection and readiness to experiment. In 1989 he met Jenny King, a theatre producer with the feistiness to stand up to him. They became partners in work and in life, collaborating as Centreline Productions on shows such as <span class="italic">Auntie and Me</span>, seen in London in 2003. By this time Phillips, a long-time drinker and smoker, was already battling throat cancer, yet continued to produce fine work on shows as diverse as <span class="italic">Honeymoon Suite</span>, his final work at the Royal Court, and in summer 2004 <span class="italic">Mercy</span> at the Soho Theatre, London, another company with new writing at its heart. He died on 18 September 2004 at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, London, of cancer of the throat, having, as one obituary noted, carefully poured and consumed his last drink, a Baileys on ice, a few days previously  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 22 Sept 2004). He was survived by Jenny King and by his son.<br>
