<span class="headword">Chalmers,  Robert</span>, Baron Chalmers  (1858&#150;1938), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at 14 Allen Road, Albert Town, Hornsey, Middlesex, on 18 August 1858, the only son of John Chalmers, a bookseller and publisher, originally from Aberdeen, and his wife, Julia, daughter of Robert Mackay. He was educated at the City of London School, where the headmaster, Dr Edwin Abbott, strongly influenced him in his commitment to scholarship and public service. In 1877 he entered Oriel College, Oxford, where he took a first class in classical moderations in 1878 and a second class in natural science (biology) in 1881. For a time he contemplated studying medicine at Edinburgh, but in 1882 he entered the open competitive examination for the upper division of the civil service and was placed first on the list with what was then a record total of marks.<br>
<br>Chalmers entered the Treasury as a second-class clerk on 14 August 1882 and rose steadily thereafter: from first-class clerk on 15 April 1894 to principal clerk on 25 February 1899, and to assistant secretary on 1 April 1903. For most of that time he served in the Treasury's finance division, and on 28 October 1907 he was appointed chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, where he was largely responsible for the transfer of the excise from the Inland Revenue to a new board of customs and excise in 1908. In this role, and from 24 July 1911, when he succeeded Sir George Murray as permanent secretary of the Treasury, he was one of the principal advisers to successive chancellors of the exchequer: H. H. Asquith, David Lloyd George, Reginald McKenna, and Andrew Bonar Law. Chalmers had strong Liberal convictions and at first he got on well with Lloyd George, of whose 1909 budget he was one of the principal architects, but they fell out in 1913, when Chalmers believed that the chancellor had misled the House of Commons. On 26 September that year, apparently at his own suggestion, Chalmers was appointed governor of Ceylon, where he was able to indulge his hobby of the study of Pali, the ancient language of that country, on which he published several books.<br>
<br>Chalmers's period as governor was marred by riots in May and June 1915, arising from tension between native Buddhists and Muslim immigrants from India, and he was glad to be asked in December that year to return to the Treasury, which was sorely in need of his talents as it sought to cope with the problems of war finance. For two months he worked in the Treasury while on leave from Ceylon and on 4 March 1916 he was appointed joint permanent secretary (in conjunction with Sir John Bradbury and Sir Thomas Heath). From May to September 1916 he acted temporarily as under-secretary for Ireland during the troubles. He returned to the Treasury, where in July 1917 he and his junior colleague, John Maynard Keynes, clashed with the governor of the Bank of England, Walter Cunliffe, who claimed that the Treasury officials had taken over the bank's functions in relation to financing purchases in the United States. The chancellor, Bonar Law, supported Chalmers and Keynes, and Cunliffe had to concede the Treasury's primacy for the duration of the war. Chalmers was due to retire in August 1918, but at Bonar Law's request he agreed to stay on, and did not leave until 31 March 1919.<br>
<br>Chalmers had a reputation for tough efficiency and a sarcastic wit. However, behind a mask of pomposity and cynicism he hid a kind heart and a generous nature. As a young man he lived in the East End of London, where he worked under Samuel Barnett, then vicar of St Jude's, Whitechapel, giving up all the time not required by his work at the Treasury to helping by personal contact the poor and sick. As a senior official, he was a source of encouragement to younger members of his department, provided that they showed no fear of him (if they did he became irritated). He had a flair for bestowing nicknames: it was apparently he who first dubbed Lloyd George the Goat.<br>
<br>Chalmers combined public service with scholarship. As a Treasury clerk he persuaded the master of the rolls to unlock the gates of the Public Record Office in Chancery Lane after dark, and there carried out the research that led to his <span class="italic">History of Currency in the British Colonies</span> (1893). As a member of the Pali Text Society he contributed to the translation and editing of a number of Buddhist texts published between 1895 and 1932. In 1919 he was appointed a member of the royal commission on the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and, as a member of the commission, stayed for a time at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where his younger son had been an undergraduate, incorporating his Oxford degree at Cambridge and becoming a member of the college. He was elected master of Peterhouse in 1924, and during his seven years of office took a personal interest in the undergraduates, providing lavish hospitality and often helping poorer scholars unostentatiously from his own pocket.<br>
<br>Chalmers was appointed CB in 1900, KCB in 1908, and GCB in 1916, and on his retirement was made Baron Chalmers of Northiam in Sussex. He was elected an honorary fellow of Oriel College in 1918, and he received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow (1913), Oxford (1923), Cambridge (1924), and St Andrews (1930). He was a trustee of the British Museum (1924&#150;31) and president of the Royal Asiatic Society (1922&#150;5), and was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1927.<br>
<br>Chalmers married Maud Mary, daughter of John George Pigott, a musician, on 2 July 1888; they had two sons, Ralph and Robert, and one daughter, Mabel. Ralph became a professional soldier, Robert a barrister. Both were killed while on active service in May 1915. His wife died in 1923, and on 1 June 1935 he married Iris Florence, elder daughter of Sir John Harvard Biles, professor of naval architecture at Glasgow University, and widow of Robert Latta, professor of logic at Glasgow University. Chalmers died on 17 November 1938 at his home, 14 Crick Road, Oxford. His funeral service was in Oriel College chapel, and there was a memorial service in the Chapel of the Order of the Bath, Westminster Abbey. As he died without surviving male children, the peerage became extinct.<br>
