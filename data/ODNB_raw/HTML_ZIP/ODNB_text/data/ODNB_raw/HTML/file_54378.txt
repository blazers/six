<span class="headword">Southwell,  Charles</span>  (1814&#150;1860), <span class="occ">freethinker and journalist</span>, was born in London, the thirty-third (and last) child of a piano maker, William Southwell (<i>c</i>.1758&#150;1825/6), and the only child of Fanny, his former servant and third wife, who was at least thirty years his junior. William Southwell had taken out early patents in the search for a small upright piano suitable for domestic use. At school Charles was rebellious and intractable but read widely. After his father's death, the eleven year old became a piano finisher at Broadwood &amp; Sons, having rejected the more genteel occupation of a tuner which his brothers had arranged for him. A copy of Timothy Dwight's <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1828), lent by a pious fellow workman, led Southwell to follow his father in repudiating Christianity.<br>
<br>Southwell abandoned factory work during the reform crisis of the early 1830s. He opened an ultra-radical bookshop in Westminster, where he participated in opening a &#145;rational school&#146; and defended the seditious press from clerical attacks. His youthful marriage to Mary Seaford around 1832 was marked by separation and mutual infidelity (on Southwell's side with his wife's aunt, in a relationship which raised accusations of bigamy). Unhappily reunited, the couple ran the shop, which failed after two years when Mary became terminally ill. Following her wishes, when she died (<i>c</i>.1835) Southwell watched a surgeon open her body to ensure that she was dead and remove her heart as an anatomical specimen. Only the intervention of the police prevented a riot.<br>
<br>Hoping to make a new start, Southwell joined the British Legion in 1835 to fight as a royalist mercenary in Spain against the Carlists. He returned two years later, half-starved and nearly penniless, to work once more at Broadwoods. Attracted to radical debate rather than making pianos, Southwell created a sensation with his open-air addresses on Kennington Common. In 1840 the central board of the Association of All Classes of All Nations (AACAN) confirmed him as a socialist missionary, first in London, then in Birmingham. However, Southwell chafed at Robert Owen's attempts to curb uninhibited attacks on theology, and he resigned in 1841, soon after bringing the campaign to Bristol. Together with William Chilton and John Field, Southwell began the <span class="italic">Oracle of Reason</span>, a penny weekly advocating atheism. Aggressively confrontational, the <span class="italic">Oracle</span> featured a pro-evolutionary series (begun by Southwell, continued by Chilton) using science to prove the bestial origins of the human race. Southwell's antisemitic diatribe against the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, &#145;The Jew book&#146;, led to his arrest in 1842. In one of the most celebrated blasphemy trials of the century he was fined &pound;100 and sentenced to a year in prison.<br>
<br>After his release Southwell refused to resume the <span class="italic">Oracle</span> editorship, much to the annoyance of his associates, launching instead the more temperate (but short-lived) <span class="italic">Investigator</span>. He campaigned for free thought in Edinburgh and especially in London, where in 1844 he opened the Paragon Hall and Coffee House in Lambeth. The dampness of the rooms, combined with Southwell's ambitions as an actor, led him to sell up in 1848 and take a lease on the Canterbury Theatre. This failed almost immediately, and Southwell returned to London where he managed a lecture hall at Blackfriars.<br>
<br>Throughout this period, Southwell lived with a Mrs Gordon (formerly Mrs Rowen), a married woman who managed his finances. Deeply affected by her death from uterine cancer in 1849, and harassed by the Inland Revenue which fined him &pound;150 for serving alcohol without a licence, Southwell prepared to sail for the United States. However, freethinkers in Manchester convinced him to take over their Hall of Science, which he did with great (though temporary) success, baiting evangelicals, organizing displays of religious idolatry and issuing the weekly <span class="italic">Lancashire Beacon</span>. After this &#145;vain attempt to revolutionize Lancashire&#146;  (Southwell, 98), he returned in 1850 to London, where he lectured on theological and literary subjects. He became convinced of the futility of debating abstract questions such as the existence of a deity, although he continued to denounce Christianity and the church.<br>
<br>Southwell was a brilliant platform speaker, free thought's most electrifying and entertaining advocate in the 1830s and 1840s. Reckless and impulsive, he drew huge working- and lower-middle-class crowds with his verbal pyrotechnics and outrageous vulgarity. He published dozens of pamphlets, including an attack on marriage (1840), and revealing <span class="italic">Confessions</span> (1850), written to counter scurrilous diatribes by former associate and fellow blasphemer Thomas Paterson. Southwell also worked with William Chilton, Robert Cooper, Walter Cooper, George Jacob Holyoake, and Lloyd Jones, but quarrelled with all of them and hated ties with any organized movement. As radicals sought respectability and institutional security after 1848, Southwell's racy individualism looked increasingly out of place.<br>
<br>In 1855 Southwell emigrated to Melbourne, where he lectured, engaged in radical politics, and acted in his favourite role, Shylock. In the following year he went on a theatrical tour, first to Sydney and then to Auckland, where he began lecturing after the company folded. Southwell ridiculed missionary attempts to protect the lands and rights of Aboriginal peoples, whom he dismissed as racially inferior barbarians. In 1856 he started a weekly newspaper, the <span class="italic">Auckland Examiner</span>, which ran for four years before closing through financial difficulties. Once again penniless, Southwell died of consumption on 7 August 1860 at Wynyardton Villa, Symonds Street, Auckland, leaving a widow, and was buried in the Symonds Street cemetery in Auckland.<br>
