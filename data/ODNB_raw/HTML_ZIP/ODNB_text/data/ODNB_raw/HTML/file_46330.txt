<span class="headword">Rossa,  Jeremiah  O'Donovan</span> <span class="st"> [Diarmuid  &Oacute; Donnabh&aacute;in Rosa]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1831, <em>d.</em> 1915), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was baptized Jeremiah O'Donovan (Diarmuid &Oacute; Donnabh&aacute;in) on 10 September 1831 in Ross Carbery, south-west co. Cork, the son of Dennis O'Donovan 
    (Donnchadh &Oacute; Donnabh&aacute;in; <i>d</i>. 1847)
  , an impoverished tenant farmer of Carrig-a-griannan, and his wife, Nellie O'Driscoll (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1803), daughter of Cornelius O'Driscoll and Anna-ni-Laoghaire.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandactivism"></a>Early life and activism</h2>With the obvious exception of Daniel O'Connell, O'Donovan was the only native Irish speaker among modern Irish nationalist leaders, having been taught to read and write the language by his father. Early education (until 1844) at the newly formed national school under John Cushan gave him a comparable love for the English language and literature but the old tongue haunted him throughout his life. So did the death of his father on 25 March 1847, followed by the family's eviction in the worst depths of the great famine and the subsequent emigration of his mother and siblings to Philadelphia. He contrasted their fate with his ancestors' alleged pre-Cromwellian ownership of Rossmore, whence he added Rossa to his name in 1854. The Gaelic version, Rosa, simply means &#145;of Ross&#146;, not necessarily betokening the land claims which he asserted by its adoption. His later preference for calling himself Rossa may derive from Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span> or similar Scottish works where landowners are addressed by place name.<br>
<br>O'Donovan worked as apprentice clerk and general manager in the hardware store of a cousin-in-law, Mortimer Downing at Skibbereen, from 1848 to 1853, thereafter establishing himself as a retail general storekeeper. Having bought a pedlar's stock of 240 volumes for &pound;1, he gained the hold on literature that enabled him to exchange quotations with Lord Devon during interrogation in 1870 on his prison experiences. Applying for postmastership in 1858 he described himself<blockquote>
<div>like bards of high and low degree<br>
</div>
<div>Of amative propensity<br>
</div>
<div>I married, just at twenty-one,<br>
</div>
<div>Since then four years are past and gone,<br>
</div>
<div>And every year that past me o'er<br>
</div>
<div>An Irishman came on my floor.<br>
</div>
<div>I, with these youths, my time beguile,<br>
</div>
<div>Half-idle in my domicile<br>
</div>
<div>Which in a large and central street,<br>
</div>
<div>For a post office would be meet.<br>
</div>
<div>I trust I'll meet not disaster<br>
</div>
<div>Till you address me as &#145;Postmaster&#146;.<br>
</div>
<div>Excuse my lord, the wish most fervent<br>
</div>
<div>I have to be your lordship's servant.<br>
</div> (Rossa, <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, 1972 edn, 215)</blockquote>But his arrest on a charge of treason-felony on 5 December 1858 proved the disaster in question. Rossa's high-spirited versification reflected a mingling of ideological iconoclasm, personal good nature, and facile passions, which may help to explain the homicidal, even genocidal, politics that he continually offset by extraordinarily genuine kindliness. He had been a youthful repealer, knowing songs in honour of Daniel O'Connell and shaking the great man's hand after the Skibbereen repeal meeting in 1843. The famine hardened his nationalism as it did that of west Cork in general. His first reported speech, at the Phoenix National and Literary Society, Skibbereen, on 2 January 1858, claimed that in 1846&#150;7 &#145;England allowed thousands of our people to starve, and blasphemously charged God Almighty with the crime&#146;. James Stephens reached Skibbereen in May 1858 and swore in Rossa to his new Irish Republican (or, as Rossa would always maintain it was called, Revolutionary) Brotherhood, together with many other Phoenix Society members. Rossa's constant travels to Bantry and Kenmare on hardware business had built up good contacts and would expedite recruitment. But the police easily penetrated local ranks, and he was among the thirty-one arrested in December 1858.<br>
<br>The prisoners heard nothing from Stephens, now in the USA; according to Rossa his message telling them not to plead guilty never reached them. One prisoner was convicted, and the rest pleaded guilty on the promise of remission of his ten-year sentence and their own release (after eight months in gaol without trial). Stephens now renewed contact, and in 1861 Rossa helped to manage the Cork&#150;Dublin leg of the funeral of the Young Irelander Terence Bellew MacManus, an escaped convict from the 1848 rising who had died in poverty in San Francisco, from which the Fenians derived impressive propaganda and personnel gains. He was also active in 1861 in the national petition movement, which collected half a million signatures, and from which the Fenians claimed further recruits. By this time Rossa's own retail business had been blacklisted by most local landlords, but was used by local authorities for disseminating food to starving islanders off Cape Clear in 1862, albeit briefly. He went to the USA in summer 1863 and later claimed that he formed the intention of taking out American citizenship at that time, but returned to Ireland to become manager of the Fenian paper the <span class="italic">Irish People</span>, whose initial losses he subvented. The paper lasted from November 1863 to 16 September 1865, the day after Rossa's arrest, which was followed by those of the editor, John O'Leary, and the publisher, Thomas Clarke Luby. They were indicted for high treason, the Dublin prosecutor Charles Barry QC asserting that they intended to have all the landed aristocracy and Catholic clergy massacred. These charges were baseless and they were silently dropped, but their ventilation probably sealed the prisoners' fate when the more easily provable offence of treason-felony was substituted. After Luby and O'Leary had been sentenced in December 1865 to ten years' imprisonment apiece, Rossa dismissed his counsel, and harangued the court for a day with extracts from the <span class="italic">Irish People</span> largely chosen for their offensive comments upon the past political vicissitudes of Mr Justice William Keogh, who presided. The press in general abused rather than reported Rossa, whose former plea of guilty in 1859 entitled Keogh to pass the sentence of life imprisonment in England, which he served chiefly in Pentonville, Portland, Millbank, and Chatham.<br>
<br>The fastidious John O'Leary instructed his colleagues to bear any ill treatment stoically, but Rossa's puritanism was horrified at the want of sexual privacy. His sex drive was strong: his first marriage on 6 June 1853 to Nora (or Nanno) Eager (<i>d</i>. 1859) produced four sons; he then married Eile&aacute;n n&iacute; Bhuachalla of Castlehaven, co. Cork, in 1861, but she died aged nineteen in 1863, leaving one son, who was reared by her family. Rossa's <span class="italic">Recollections</span> merely includes her, unnamed, in his assertion that &#145;I never was rich; I never will be rich; but I got some of the best and handsomest girls in the country to marry me&#151;simply on account of myself and my name&#146;. On 22 November 1864 he married his third wife from west Cork, the nineteen-year-old Mary Jane Irwin (1845&#150;1916) of Clonakilty [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51001/', "Rossa, Mary Jane O'Donovan")</script>], who gave birth to thirteen children and was pregnant with her first by the time of his sentence in December 1865. From this, bitter conflicts with British prison warders ensued, featuring Rossa's being forcibly stripped, with violent usage from his custodians, including the use of illegal restraining devices. At one point he flung a chamber pot in the face of the Chatham governor, for which he would have been flogged if not a Fenian prisoner: as it was, he was handcuffed at the back for 35 days with breaks for meals. He also suffered 123 days' restrictions to bread and water, and 25 days' confinement in dark cells. Rossa smuggled a letter of protest out of Portland prison, published by the sympathetic Richard Pigott in <span class="italic">The Irishman</span> of 16 March 1867. A campaign on his behalf was mounted in the House of Commons by John Bright, supported by Sir John Gray of the Dublin <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>, McCarthy Downing, John Francis Maguire, and others. A commission (the Knox&#150;Pollock) rejected complaints, but Rossa found a friend in the chief director of convict prisons, Edmund Du Cane, who proposed in October 1868 that prisoner and authorities make a fresh start, after which Rossa's conduct was exemplary.<h2>
<a name="ElectiontoWestminsterprisonreform"></a>Election to Westminster: prison reform</h2>On 22 November 1869 Rossa was nominated for a vacant House of Commons seat for Tipperary. This began as a nomination-day stunt by the editor of the Nenagh <span class="italic">Tipperary Advocate</span>, the colourful Peter Gill, but transformed into a whirlwind campaign ending in Rossa's victory on 27 November by 1131 votes to 1038 in an electorate of 9498, although the open ballot kept many voters from the poll in fear of priests and landlords. The result &#145;did not signify the upsurge of support for Fenian revolutionism that English politicians and leader-writers discerned at the time&#146;  (Comerford, 178&#150;9), yet<blockquote>O'Donovan Rossa's victory &hellip; though he himself was unseated and the verdict narrowly reversed three months later, marks the birth of modern Irish politics &hellip; Rossa defeated the Catholic candidate of a Unionist party who had swept to unprecedented victory the previous year. (Lee, 165)</blockquote>Rossa jokingly asked the Chatham governor to return him to Millbank as convenient for Westminster, where he promised to speak only in Gaelic. As a convicted felon he was quickly declared ineligible. But for all of his anti-constitutionalism he had inaugurated a politics that sealed the fate of landlord influence and turned the tide against priestly control, henceforth chastened into dependence on lay support.<br>
<br>No less paradoxically, Rossa's prison life gave noteworthy aid to British prison reform. Gladstone's first government set up a commission under William Reginald Courtenay, eleventh earl of Devon: O'Leary once again told the prisoners to eschew all co-operation beyond civility, but Rossa again played his own game. The record shows a meeting of minds that is deeply honourable to Rossa and to the commissioners alike. The prison authorities attempted an extended cover-up of what had occurred during the period before Du Cane, and the commissioners broke down official evidence to find for Rossa, whose honesty was almost heart-breaking. The unionist commissioner G. C. Brodrick found the case &#145;fully proved&#146;, adding that Rossa &#145;certainly impressed us all favourably by his manly bearing; and, after his release I received a letter from him which did credit to his better feelings&#146;  (Brodrick, 165&#150;6). Rossa was particularly upset by a decision early in his imprisonment to proclaim a detected contraband letter to his wife as a seduction attempt on the wife of another convict, and also by official concealment from wife and husband of each other's censored communications. The Devon commissioners sometimes interviewed husband and wife together, partly in order to give them time together in decent conditions. Mary O'Donovan Rossa had made her way to America, raised money by poetry readings, published a volume of verse, campaigned in Ireland for amnesty for the prisoners, and organized other women in support of arms purchase and amnesty agitation alike.<br>
<br>Rossa's evidence to the committee shows him at his eloquent best, revealing a dawning of concern about his fellow prisoners, political and criminal, and of a human desire to help alleviate their torments. But his subsequent memoir of imprisonment suffers from self-advertisement to a mass audience even more than from its propagandistic status. It was originally published in New York as <span class="italic">Six Years in English Prisons</span> in 1874; reprinted there as <span class="italic">Irish Rebels in English Prisons</span> (1882, 1889), and later reprinted in Ireland in abridged form as <span class="italic">My Years in English Jails: the Brutal Facts</span>, ed. Sean Ua Cearnaigh (1967). His later <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (New York, 1898; reprinted in Ireland, 1972, with an introduction by Se&aacute;n &Oacute; L&uacute;ing) contained the poem &#145;Jillen Andy&#146;, which he composed in gaol, an impressive description of a great famine burial from the standpoint of a retarded child. The humanity shown here and in his evidence help to explain the intense personal affection he aroused among so many who abominated his hatreds.<h2>
<a name="RossainAmerica"></a>Rossa in America</h2>Rossa and thirty-two other amnestied Fenians were released in January 1871, on condition of remaining outside British dominions for the remnant of their sentence. Together with John Devoy and three others he arrived in New York. Here he was promptly cornered by Thomas Murphy, the collector of the port of New York appointed by the republican Ulysses Grant, and as such ambitious to annex the Irish vote. Rossa, hopelessly out of his depth, was cajoled and flattered into standing for the state senate against the Tammany Hall boss William Marcy Tweed, then on the verge of his fall. Rossa was admitted to American citizenship on 21 February 1871, for which he supposedly qualified by his visit in 1863 and his wife's domicile during part of his imprisonment, in lieu of the usual requirement of five years' residence. Tweed's forces retained the senate seat in November: no doubt the majority was inflated fraudulently, but the victory was almost certainly genuine. Tweed, under heavy investigation, fled, but was captured, tried, and died in prison. Thus Rossa was led to believe he had won, with resultant inflammation of his conceit and frustration.<br>
<br>Rossa became weekly American correspondent of Pigott's <span class="italic">Irishman</span> from July 1871 until its take-over by Parnell in 1881. He joined the proliferating lecture circuit, showing himself fluent, fiery, possessed of wit and irony. He became an emigration ticket agent; edited a weekly, <span class="italic">The Era</span> (New York, 1871&#150;2), and went into the hotel business. He was drinking heavily at this time, as he had when under pressure in his <span class="italic">Irish People</span> days; his wife bullied and weaned him into a return to total abstinence in the 1880s as their family grew larger. In the mean time he moved back into the Fenian front line of publicity. Devoy had started his own body, the Clan na Gael, but Rossa, Luby, and others reconstituted the old Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), pledging support late in January 1876 to its dethroned leaders, John O'Mahony in the USA and Stephens in Europe. Meanwhile in December 1876 Rossa wrote a letter to the New York <span class="italic">Irish World</span> (then the best-selling American weekly) proposing a &#145;skirmishing fund&#146; to subsidize parties which &#145;would keep striking England year after year while the revolutionary organisations are preparing for the heavier work&#146;: Patrick Ford, the editor&#150;owner, withheld the letter until March 1876 and then endorsed it. This effectively launched the idea of Irish patriotic urban terrorism and was promptly repudiated publicly by O'Leary, and privately by Stephens and other Fenian leaders. Rossa justified hanging cabinet ministers who proposed hanging Fenians &#145;or in burning up on the previous evening, the town or the city which they were to be hanged in, <i>to prevent it</i> so that the murder could not take place there&#146;. O'Leary doubted that he was serious, though Rossa went on to advocate saturating the House of Commons with &#145;osmic gas&#146;, which touched off enthusiastic reactions from many Irish-Americans, reflecting their growing militancy. The growing fund was at first put to propagandistic use, as in the shipping home in 1877 of the body of O'Mahony, who had virtually starved to death: Rossa was elected in his place as head centre of the IRB on 2 February that year.<br>
<br>Rossa operated as secretary of the skirmishing fund until 23 May 1878 when he was smoothly ousted by the Clan na Gael for indiscretion, irregular accounting, and genial alcoholic sprees. Hence he was bitterly opposed to Clan co-operation with Michael Davitt and the Land League formed in 1879, however sympathetic he would otherwise have found its ideals. The IRB was hopelessly moribund. In 1880 Rossa started a personal newspaper, the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>, which he and his wife, Mary, ran for thirty years. Its companion organization, the United Irishmen of America, had less effect, save to ensure his expulsion from Clan na Gael and his isolation in exile politics, and to involve him occasionally in sending urban guerrillas to Britain, who numbered far fewer than contemporaries assumed. On 14 January 1881 an explosion at Salford barracks killed a boy of seven, and on 16 April that year 40lb of coarse blasting powder in a wooden box with a burning fuse attached was discovered in the Mansion House, London. Rossa claimed responsibility for these and other explosions, some of which had natural causes. A blast shook the House of Commons on 15 March 1883, for which Rossa gnomically implied his authority: some money from him was traced to dynamiters' possession, and rumour noisily identified him with outrages, but he seems to have been largely &#145;the shadow of a dynamiter&#146; in the sense that Sean O'Casey's eponymous play speaks of the <span class="italic">Shadow of a Gunman</span>. On 2 February 1885 Lucille Yseult Dudley, an Englishwoman, shot Rossa; she was pronounced insane at her trial on 30 June, put in an asylum, and later discharged. Rossa was convinced of her British secret service credentials. Possibly in retaliation, the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> printed an advertisement offering $10,000 for the prince of Wales, alive or dead. Rossa himself incited Irish readers in the British forces to murder their officers in the heat of battle. The dynamite campaign of the early 1880s was mostly the action of Clan na Gael or its splinter groups; but Rossa's rhetoric bears more responsibility than his actions, in that the Clan may have acted in part to prevent his stealing their thunder. However empty, drunken, or insane his conduct, the horrors of IRA murder campaigns in the twentieth century derived from the legitimacy he gave to urban guerrilla bombing.<br>
<br>Rossa's finances led him into dependence on revolutionaries, some of whom were British agents, such as Red Jim McDermott. On 12 November 1888 the radical MP Henry Labouchere asserted in the Commons that Rossa was himself in British pay. The enraged Rossa was then fined $100 in a New York libel suit for declaring P. S. Cassidy, a leading Clan critic of his own McDermott connection, to be the latter's successor in the British secret service. Later, when a much respectabilized Rossa was admitted to the Commons gallery, he had to be ejected for denouncing Labouchere (7 May 1895). Subsequently he revisited former Irish haunts and met surviving companions of former years, whence came the impulse to write his <span class="italic">Recollections</span>, serially published in the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span> (1896&#150;9), and later published in book form (New York, 1898; reprinted, 1972). The <span class="italic">Recollections</span> may disappoint the student of Fenianism, apart from its transcripts of a few letters between Fenian leaders. But it is a first-class source on west Cork social history, captivating in its use of the Gaelic story-teller or <i>Seancha&iacute;</i> manner, and merits close examination by the historian of emigration antecedents.<br>
<br>Former IRB colleagues, now high in the Irish Parliamentary Party support groups, found employment for the financially embarrassed Rossa in 1904&#151;as corresponding secretary under Cork county council, whence he joined Maud Gonne McBride as vice-president of the Cork Young Ireland Society. But he returned with his ailing wife to New York in 1906 and remained there to his death. As an employee of UK local government Rossa had thus made his peace with the constitutional nationalism which he had so long denounced, though he was posthumously recaptured by revolutionary forces. Devoy learned from Mary O'Donovan Rossa of Rossa's increasing debility in February 1913, and they were reconciled on St Patrick's day. Rossa had entered hospital by October 1913, where he reverted to speaking in Gaelic and rather happily believed himself to be once more in prison, &#145;a very healthy place where the people are kind&#146;. His wife kept close links with Devoy, who manipulated her rejection of Redmondite auspices for the inevitable funeral, which he envisaged as a propaganda coup for the IRB. Rossa was by now an inspiration to the Gaelic League, particularly to Patrick Pearse. He died at Staten Island, New York, on 29 June 1915 and his widow oversaw the removal of his remains to Dublin, where the funeral on 1 August was masterminded by Thomas Clarke, Devoy's Dublin agent, and amounted to an overture for the Easter rising in the following year.<blockquote>Pearse's oration &hellip; was more than an unqualified denunciation of the British attitude towards Ireland; it was a declaration of war by the Irish revolutionaries against England. Pearse ignored Redmond and Home Rule, and asserted that the national tradition of freedom was that of Tone, Mitchel and Rossa. (Dudley Edwards, 208&#150;9)</blockquote>Rossa was buried in Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin. His wife died on 17 August 1916, after writing an account of the funeral for Devoy's <span class="italic">Gaelic American</span>. Pearse described Rossa as the most typical Fenian, a euphemism for his intellectual inferiority to Stephens, O'Leary, Luby, and Devoy: Rossa's resultant complex compounded his problems. But in reputation he maintained a heroic if at times demented image, a Hercules or Cu Chulainn occasionally insane, which harmonized with the images Pearse wished to invoke. Significantly, press observers credited him with 6 feet in height, although he was in fact little more than 5 feet 9 inches (and weighed 154 lb after five years in gaol). He was usually bearded, but his clean-shaven convict portrait reveals a hard if crudely sensitive face. He spoke with post-Gaelic syntax in a resonant if somewhat harsh west Cork accent, but after his American sojourn was credited with some American accent (at his 1865 trial, amid fears of attack from demobilized Irish-American soldiers from the civil war, his voice marked him as a dangerous figure). He had a command of French and Latin, and occasionally intruded elements from each into his speech. Few likeable men have done greater harm, in his case with less than normal responsibility.<br>
