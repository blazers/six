<span class="headword">Higgs <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Kingsland]</span>,  Mary Ann</span>  (1854&#150;1937), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was born on 2 February 1854 in Devizes, Wiltshire, the eldest of three children of William Kingsland (1826&#150;1876), a Congregational minister, and his wife, Caroline Paddon (1818&#150;1888?). In 1862 the family moved north on William's accepting the invitation to be minister at College Chapel, Bradford. Initially taught at home with her brothers, Mary went at the age of thirteen to Miss Scott's, a local private school. In 1871 she won an exhibition to the College for Women, Hitchin, which in 1873 transferred to Girton College, Cambridge. The first woman to take Cambridge's natural science tripos, she gained second-class honours in 1874, belatedly receiving an honorary MA many years later.<br>
<br>After eighteen months as assistant lecturer at Girton, Mary Kingsland taught mathematics and science at the recently established grammar school for girls in Bradford, later teaching also at the Saltaire School, Shipley. Her hopes of helping her father in the church were dashed when he died of consumption in 1876. Until she married a fellow Congregationalist, Revd Thomas Kilpin Higgs (1851&#150;1907), Mary Kingsland helped to support her family. After her marriage, which took place on 5 August 1879, Mary moved to Staffordshire, where Thomas was minister at Hanley Tabernacle; here, their first three children were born. Concern for her health prompted a move to Withington, near Manchester, in 1888, but difficulties in the church and failing health led Thomas to resign in 1890. That year a fourth child was born. After several unsettled months the family moved to Oldham, Thomas serving as minister of Greenacres Congregational Church for sixteen years until his death.<br>
<br>Mary Higgs's interests were wide-ranging: besides church work, she collaborated with W. T. Stead and others on a <span class="italic">Twentieth Century New Testament</span> (1898, 1900), reportedly practising Greek while making puddings in the kitchen. Subsequent religious works included poems, meditations, and a prize-winning essay, <span class="italic">Christ and his Miracles in the Light of Modern Psychology</span> (1905). This reflected her desire to reconcile her essentially mystical faith with her interest in science, particularly the new discipline of psychology to which W. T. Stead had introduced her.<br>
<br>Mary Higgs's pioneering social work was also inspired by her friendship with Stead&#151;best-known for his expos&eacute; of under-age prostitution in London in the 1880s&#151;and others, including Ebenezer Howard, originator of the garden city movement. She in turn inspired the foundation in 1902 of the much imitated Beautiful Oldham Society, and was active in its wide-ranging programme to improve the town's appearance and build a garden suburb. Her involvement led to her writing a weekly column in the <span class="italic">Oldham Standard</span> and the <span class="italic">Oldham Chronicle</span>: addressed to &#145;Young Oldham&#146;, it appeared from 1910 to 1937, under the pseudonym &#145;Mrs Minerva&#146;. She also played a part in wider moves to improve the provision of playing fields and to cut down smoke pollution.<br>
<br>Higgs wrote and lectured on many social questions, notably unemployment and child development. From 1905 she collaborated with Dr John Paton, principal of the Nottingham Congregational Institute, to arrange yearly summer schools for the study of social questions: they were attended by experts from the settlement movement, temperance campaigns, and other fields of social work. She was an early advocate of family allowances, widowed mothers' pensions, and insurances for other life events. Her Oldham home, Bent House, served as a base for countless welfare organizations, many brought together in the Council of Social Welfare. Mobilizing an army of helpers, she established a paper-sorting industry to employ destitute women, pioneered mother and infant welfare centres, and founded Oldham's first evening play centre. Other initiatives included a mission and club for unemployed men, opened in 1909, and a wartime women's workroom, the model for what became known as Queen Mary's workrooms.<br>
<br>Mary Higgs is, however, best-known as an advocate of vagrancy reform. About 1899 she found a room where women could stay in emergencies; later, with a benefactor, she set up three women's lodging-houses in Oldham. She was, however, keen to discover for herself why women shunned existing shelters, and over many years from 1903 took the highly unusual step (for a middle-class woman) of visiting workhouse wards and common lodging-houses dressed as a tramp. Her vivid accounts of the dirt and degradation which she encountered and of the downward spiral of destitution in which homeless women found themselves helped to fuel demands for more and better regulated women's lodgings, and for lodgings geared to the needs of migrant workers. Many of her descriptions were brought together in <span class="italic">Glimpses into the Abyss</span> (1906), anticipating by over twenty years George Orwell's similar but much better known <span class="italic">Down and out in Paris and London</span> (1933). This work drew on her research into conditions in other countries and linked the need for legislation with evolutionary theories. She became an acknowledged authority, giving evidence at inquiries such as the 1906 departmental committee on vagrancy, producing practical manuals, and acting as a prime mover in founding the National Association for Women's Lodging-Homes in 1909. In 1916 opposition to conscription led Higgs to join the Society of Friends, being already sympathetic to its beliefs. She became an elder, and in later years worked through the Quakers and with the Vagrancy Reform Society on vagrancy-related issues, giving evidence to the departmental committee on the relief of the casual poor (1930). Her later work (practical and written) focused on the rising tide of homeless unemployed boys and men, and included running experimental schools for unemployed boys (1929), helping to set up training farms for Young Wayfarers, and opening a fellowship and service club and hostels in Oldham for unemployed men (1933&#150;5). Her own spirituality found expression in her editing of <span class="italic">The Way to the Joyous Life</span> (1937), a selection of W. T. Stead's devotional writings.<br>
<br>Known to many as Mother Mary, Mary Higgs died on 19 March 1937 at 4 Macartney House, Chesterfield Walk, her daughter's house in Greenwich, soon after receiving an OBE for her services to Oldham. She was cremated on 23 March at Golders Green and her ashes were interred at Greenacres Congregational Church on 3 April, amid widespread tributes to her tirelessness, humour, practicality, and vision.<br>
