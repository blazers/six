<span class="headword">Freshfield family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1800&#150;1918), <span class="occ">lawyers</span>, were partners in the City of London firm of solicitors which since 1800 has always used the Freshfield name in its title. Eight members of the Freshfield family, spanning four generations, held this position.<br>
<br>The Freshfield family's origins are obscure until the mid-eighteenth century when James [i] Freshfield, born at Newport, Isle of Wight, in 1727, is recorded as working in London as a watchcase maker. He was not, apparently, very successful since he was declared bankrupt twice, in 1755 and in 1774, and, to the mortification of his grandson, spent some time in the Fleet prison. The son of James [i], James [ii] (1751&#150;1803), was a watchmaker and from 1774 until his death a freeman of the Clockmakers' Company. In 1775 this James Freshfield married Elizabeth Snow of Windsor. Their eldest son (the first of nine children, not all of whom survived) was <a name="cosubject_49716"></a><span class="headword">James Joseph William Freshfield</span>  (1775&#150;1864)<span class="occ"></span>, the first member of the family to enter the legal profession.<br>
<br>Of James Joseph William's early life and education nothing is known. In 1790, at fifteen, he was articled to a London attorney and in 1795 he was admitted to the profession. Freshfield practised on his own, first at New Inn and then in Aldermanbury, until early in 1800. In that year he joined, as a partner, the firm then known as Winter and Kaye at 29 St Swithin's Lane. The firm, whose origins can be traced to a partnership in the early eighteenth century, was in 1800 one of the most significant in the City. It counted among its clients not only the Bank of England, a connection dating back almost to the establishment of the bank, but also the Royal Exchange Assurance and the banking houses of Smith, Payne and Smith (in London, Nottingham, and Hull). The Smiths, notably Robert Smith (1752&#150;1838), created Baron Carrington by William Pitt in 1796, were closely connected with the Wilberforce and Thornton families and belonged to the influential evangelical group within the Church of England. James Joseph William was an active member of the Church Missionary Society in its early years&#151;it was established by the evangelicals in 1799&#151;and it is likely that this connection helped him, an able and ambitious young man of humble origins, to join such a prestigious firm. Freshfield soon formed a close working relationship with Joseph Kaye, one of the two senior partners, and in 1808 the partnership between Kaye and Winter was dissolved. Winter and his two sons established themselves separately in practice and Kaye and Freshfield retained most of the clients including the highly prized business of the Bank of England.<br>
<br>On 27 February 1799 Freshfield had married Mary Blackett 
    (or Blacket; 1776&#150;1819)
  , daughter of John and Abigail Blackett of West Smithfield. Born into a respectable nonconformist family, it seems unlikely that she brought either wealth or connection to the marriage; John Blackett came of a well-established dissenting Durham family of farmers involved in the wool trade. James Joseph William and Mary Freshfield had a family of eleven children, nine of whom survived to adulthood. Of their four surviving sons, three became solicitors. Their eldest son, <a name="cosubject_49717"></a><span class="headword">James William [i] Freshfield</span>  (1801&#150;1857)<span class="occ"></span>, was sent at the age of five to a dissenting academy in St Neots, Huntingdonshire, most probably through his mother's connections in that part of the world. From 1809 until 1816 he attended Dr Heathcote's school in Hackney. Until 1813 the Freshfields and their growing family lived in Hackney but in that year Freshfield senior bought the Manor House (also known as Abney House) in Stoke Newington, an old and spacious house set in considerable grounds. In 1816 his son James William completed his schooling and joined the firm as an articled clerk. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1822 and became a partner in the firm in 1824. The retirement of Joseph Kaye in 1823 and the departure, in 1825, of his son Charles Kaye when his dubious financial transactions, amounting in effect to fraud against his partners, were discovered left the firm in the hands of the Freshfields. <a name="cosubject_49718"></a><span class="headword">Charles Kaye Freshfield</span>  (1808&#150;1891)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_49719"></a><span class="headword">Henry Ray Freshfield</span>  (1814&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span>, James William's younger brothers, were both educated at Charterhouse School and joined the firm in 1825 and 1830 respectively; they did not, however, become partners until 1835 and 1839. The burden of running the firm in the 1820s and 1830s therefore fell very much on James William, who, unlike his brothers, enjoyed the confidence of his father who embarked during this time on an attempt, unusual for a solicitor at that time, to become a member of parliament.<br>
<br>In 1819 James Joseph William's first wife, Mary, had died. Two years later he married his second wife, Frances Sims, for some time a friend of the family. In 1825, probably through his connection with William Manning, a West Indies merchant and former governor of the Bank of England, Freshfield was invited to stand for election in the constituency of Penryn, then a notorious Cornish rotten borough. He failed to be elected in 1826 but stood again&#151;this time successfully&#151;in 1830. Freshfield, a Peelite tory (the Peels were clients of the firm), unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Falmouth and Penryn in 1832, but was its MP from 1835 to 1841 and again from 1852 to 1857; he was also MP for Boston for a year, 1851&#150;2. In Cornwall he was actively involved in the struggle to keep the mail packet trade at Falmouth and he introduced and piloted through parliament a measure to reform rates. He continued to be, at least in name, senior partner of the firm until 1840 when he finally retired. He died on 27 June 1864.<br>
<br>In 1828 James William had married Mary Anne Dawes (1800&#150;1875), daughter of Thomas Dawes, a well-known and respected City solicitor who counted among his many clients the Rothschild banking house. Between 1829 and 1837 six children were born at New Bank Buildings, where the couple lived in accommodation over the firm's offices. Two of their sons, <a name="cosubject_49720"></a><span class="headword">William Dawes Freshfield</span>  (1831&#150;1903)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_47011"></a><span class="headword">Edwin Freshfield</span>  (1832&#150;1918)<span class="occ"></span>, became solicitors. James William was effectively in charge of the firm from the 1830s and was senior partner from 1840 until his sudden and premature death on 19 May 1857. He did much of the work for the firm's aristocratic and wealthy clients, who included the Peels, the Carringtons, and the Gladstones, as well as the Bank of England. He was highly regarded by the bank's governor and directors; their tribute to him spoke, in terms not used of any other solicitor before or since, of his integrity, the extent of his legal knowledge, and the &#145;almost irreparable&#146; loss sustained by the bank  (Bank of England court minutes, 21 May 1858, Slinn, 94).<br>
<br>James William's younger brothers Charles and Henry took over at the firm after his death. Both were by then married, Charles (in 1834) to Elizabeth Sims Stephenson (<i>d</i>. 1849), daughter of Daniel Stephenson, an elder brother of Trinity House, Henry (in 1840) to Jane Crawford, daughter of William Crawford, an East India merchant well connected in the City of London, which he represented as its MP from 1833 to 1841, and a director of the Alliance Assurance Company. Charles had two sons who both died young and Henry had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33275/', "Douglas William Freshfield")</script>, who became better known as a traveller and mountaineer. The future of the firm, therefore, lay in the hands of their nephews, William Dawes and Edwin, both educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. They both became partners in 1858 but it was not until the 1870s that their uncles retired. Charles went in 1870; he was MP for Dover from 1865 to 1868 and from 1874 to 1885 and died on 5 June 1891. Henry retired from the firm in 1877, spending his retirement at Kidbrooke Park, a house and estate in Sussex he had bought three years before. He was active in local affairs as a JP and as high sheriff of Sussex in 1885 (his father had held the same office for Surrey in 1850). Henry Freshfield died on 8 February 1895 and, like his brother Charles, left a considerable personal estate.<br>
<br>On 19 August 1903 William Dawes Freshfield died suddenly. The year before, the only surviving son born to him and his wife, Elizabeth Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Borrer, <a name="cosubject_75872"></a><span class="headword">James William [ii] Freshfield</span>  (1877&#150;1954)<span class="occ"></span>, had been admitted to the firm as a partner. From 1903 until 1918 the firm's senior partner was Edwin Freshfield. In 1861 he had married Zoe Charlotte Hanson, daughter of J. F. Hanson, the Levant Company's representative in Smyrna. Edwin's travels in that part of the world, which he first visited in 1854&#150;5 after he left Cambridge, and his marriage gave him a lifetime interest in Greece and the surrounding areas. He was awarded a doctorate from Cambridge for a treatise on the laws of the late Roman empire. He and his wife had one son, <a name="cosubject_75874"></a><span class="headword">Edwin Hanson Freshfield</span>  (1864&#150;1948)<span class="occ"></span>, who, after Winchester and Trinity College, Cambridge, joined the firm in 1888, and married Mary Lee Riddell in 1905. Like his father, he had considerable antiquarian and scholarly interests. Edwin Freshfield died on 1 September 1918; Edwin Hanson Freshfield retired from the firm three years later, and spent most of his retirement travelling in the Near East; he died in May 1948. In 1927 the last member of the Freshfield family to be a partner, James William, whose interest in the law had never been strong, also retired. The firm continued to flourish under the leadership of Sir William Leese, brought in by Edwin Freshfield in 1906, and in the second half of the twentieth century developed into one of the leading City law firms.<br>
