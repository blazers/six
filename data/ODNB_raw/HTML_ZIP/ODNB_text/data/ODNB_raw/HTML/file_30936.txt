<span class="headword">Clark,  William Donaldson</span>  (1916&#150;1985), <span class="occ">journalist and international civil servant</span>, was born at Bellister Castle, near Haltwhistle, Northumberland, on 28 July 1916, the fifth son and sixth and youngest child of John McClare Clark, land agent, and his wife, Marion, daughter of Daniel Noel Jackson, physician, of Hexham. His father was sixty-two when he was born and his mother died when he was seven months old. Though his father wrote to him every week and his family was close-knit, his perception of his father as remote undoubtedly left some emotional scars. Clark attributed to it his competitiveness with his brothers and a degree of insecurity. He was educated at Oundle School, where he was head of school, and won a major scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford. His university career encompassed a half-blue for athletics and was crowned with a first-class honours degree in modern history (1938) and the prestigious Gibbs prize. A Commonwealth scholarship took him in 1938, as a fellow and lecturer in humanities, to the University of Chicago, where his lifelong affection for the United States was nurtured and some enduring transatlantic friendships formed. Bertrand Russell, who was an early influence on him, arrived in Chicago on the same day.<br>
<br>Knee trouble, which saddled Clark with a serious limp in later life, ruled him out of military service and in 1941 he began three years with the British information services in Chicago followed by an appointment as press attach&eacute; at the embassy in Washington (1945&#150;6). After the war he returned to England as London editor of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1946&#150;9), but the job did not allow full rein to his talents, which were better displayed as diplomatic correspondent of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (1950&#150;55) and as the first British television interviewer to put a cabinet minister on television.<br>
<br>At <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, F. David L. Astor, under whose aegis he joined the paper in 1950, became another major influence and Clark's concern for developing countries took root when, at the 1950 Colombo conference, Ernest Bevin outlined to him a vision of a British Commonwealth devoted to economic development. It was to become Clark's mission in life, but not before an unhappy interlude as press secretary to Sir Anthony Eden at 10 Downing Street, which culminated in his resignation because of the Suez crisis in 1956.<br>
<br>Always attracted by power, Clark was flattered by Eden's offer and persuaded himself that their political incompatibility would prove no bar to a successful relationship. In retrospect it was a bad mistake, and it was a bitter blow, when after little more than a year, appalled by the invasion of Egypt and the attempts to browbeat the BBC and other media into supporting it, he decided that he must resign. He kept his letter to the prime minister brief, but to Sir Norman Brook, the secretary to the cabinet, he undertook to remain silent and make no demonstration on leaving. In 1966 he published a novel, <span class="italic">Number 10</span>, which became a successful play; but his diary of the Suez period was first published in his posthumous memoirs, <span class="italic">From Three Worlds</span> (1986), thirty years after the event.<br>
<br>Clark could not return to his old job but Astor asked him to go to India and Africa for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and he decided to devote himself to the north&#150;south divide. After two years editing &#145;The week&#146; for the paper, he left in 1960 to set up and run, as its director, the Overseas Development Institute, which quickly established a reputation for benevolent realism in a field where both attributes were rare. It was a good time, but he accepted readily when, in 1968, he was invited to return to Washington to become director of information and public affairs at the World Bank. Arriving on the same day as the bank's new president, Robert S. McNamara, he struck up an immediate rapport with him.<br>
<br>Clark believed the cataclysm of world poverty to be just as threatening as the nuclear holocaust and his twelve years at the World Bank, during which he rose, in 1974, to be vice-president, external relations, were the most fulfilling of his life. With McNamara he travelled to over eighty countries, arguing that &#145;third-world&#146; poverty was an obscene tragedy and a threat to the future of all mankind, and urging the richer nations, in their own interest, to help developing nations help themselves. His admiration for his chief was reciprocated. McNamara said of him:<blockquote>He came to the World Bank with more experience in the politics of aid than almost anyone else in the international community. He was invaluable to a newly arrived chief executive much in need of the guidance of someone who already knew so well so many of the personalities and places with whom we were to deal in the years ahead &hellip; He was an indispensable colleague. (private information, 1990)</blockquote>When he left the World Bank in 1980, Clark succeeded, as president of the International Institute for Environment and Development, another friend, Barbara Ward, with whom he had played an important part in the setting up of the Pearson and Brandt commissions. He also became an independent director of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>.<br>
<br>Clark's personality, sometimes exotic dress sense, willingness to laugh at himself, and unpatronizing generosity made him a memorable friend. He was told he had incurable cancer of the liver on All Hallows' eve in 1984, not long after the publication of his book <span class="italic">Cataclysm</span>, which forecast the collapse of the world economy due to the refusal of developing countries to pay their debts. He faced death stoically, saying his illness enabled him to prove he was as brave as his brothers who had fought in the Second World War. Sustained by his many friends, the need to complete his memoirs, the wish to design his own tombstone, and the news of an honorary fellowship at Oriel, he was determined to die at home. He had shared The Mill in the Oxfordshire village of Cuxham for twenty-five years with his friend and associate, David Harvey, and he died there on 27 June 1985, and was buried in the churchyard nearby. He was unmarried.<br>
