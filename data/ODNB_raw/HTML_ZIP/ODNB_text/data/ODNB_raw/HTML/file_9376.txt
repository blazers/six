<span class="headword">Fettes, Sir  William</span>, baronet  (1750&#150;1836), <span class="occ">benefactor of Fettes College, Edinburgh</span>, born in Canongate, Edinburgh, on 25 June 1750, was the son of William Fettes (<i>d</i>. 1758), merchant there, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1782?), daughter of James Rae, surgeon. After attending classes at Edinburgh's high school from eight years of age he set up in business, aged eighteen, as a wine and tea merchant in Smith's Land, High Street, in Edinburgh then combined this business with that of an underwriter and banker, being connected with trading establishments in the north of England. On 27 March 1787 he married Maria (<i>d</i>. 1836), the youngest daughter of Dr Malcolm of Ayr, a retired army surgeon. They had one child, William, who was called to the bar in 1810, but died at Berlin in 1815. As a successful businessman Fettes entered the town council of Edinburgh in 1785. He soon was elected a bailie, and in 1799 became first bailie. From 1795 until 1810 he was a contractor for provisions to army forts in Scotland. In 1800 he was chosen lord provost, and in 1805 was elected for a second time to that office.<br>
<br>In 1804 Fettes was created a baronet, and in the same year retired from business and devoted himself to the management of landed estates throughout Scotland which he had purchased as investments. In 1830 he executed a trust disposition, in which, after making some minor provisions, he devoted the residue of his estate to<blockquote>form an endowment for the maintenance, education, and outfit of young people whose parents have either died without leaving sufficient funds for that purpose, or who from innocent misfortune during their own lives are unable to give suitable education to their children. (Fettes MSS)</blockquote>The trustees were given wide powers as to the administration of the estate. Fettes died on 27 May 1836 at his home, Gogarbank House, Midlothian, and was buried in Canongate churchyard, Edinburgh, on 1 June 1836. At the time of his death the trust funds amounted to &pound;166,000. According to Sir William's will the trustees could not start building until a certain number of annuitants had died and there was sufficient free capital to carry out the aim of his bequest.<br>
<br>In 1864 building began on Fettes's estate at Comely Bank, Edinburgh, according to a design by David Bryce. The college building, with chapel and headmaster's house attached, continues to form one of the most conspicuous architectural features in Edinburgh's northern suburbs. It was opened in October 1870 with fifty-one pupils. The trustees determined that on the foundation of the institution a number of boys, not exceeding fifty, should receive their board and education free, while other boys should be eligible for admission on payment. However, the proposals met with dissatisfaction from several Edinburgh residents who objected to what they saw as the small number of beneficiaries in proportion to the resources of the trust, and the college's failure to provide assistance, as was Fettes's intention, to children in reduced circumstances. The complaints prompted some changes on matters of detail but the educational endowments (Scotland) commission did not propose any essential change to the plan which the trustees had carried out. In 1970 girls were admitted to the sixth form, and since 1983 the college has been fully co-educational.<br>
