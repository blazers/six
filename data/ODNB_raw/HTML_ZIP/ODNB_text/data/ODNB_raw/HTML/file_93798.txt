<span class="headword">Davies,  David Richard</span>  (1889&#150;1958), <span class="occ">writer, political agitator, and minister of religion</span>, was born at Pontycymer, Glamorgan, on 19 February 1889, the son of Richard Davies and his wife, Hannah. He was the youngest of four children. His father had been a miner, but had broken his back in a colliery accident before Davies was born and spent some years out of work. When Davies was eight, his father found work as a chapel choirmaster and colliery checkweighman in Clydach-on-Tawe in the Swansea valley. After three or four years the family moved to Maesteg, where his father became a colliery lampman. Davies later recalled being teased at school for wearing shirts made from his elder sister's old nightshirts. The poverty of his upbringing left him with &#145;a grudge against society&#146;  (Davies, 21).<br>
<br>The Davies family was imbued with the values of working-class self-improvement. He received musical education from his father, learning the violin, and religious education from his mother. Influenced by an inspirational history teacher, he had read Macaulay's <span class="italic">History of England</span> before he was twelve. He also read Charles Lamb, Hazlitt, and Ruskin. He won a scholarship to the county school at Ystalyfera, but the family's precarious finances precluded further education, so after a brief apprenticeship in a grocer's shop, which he hated, he became a miner in his local pit before he was thirteen. He joined the Miners' Federation, later securing places on the library committee of the Maesteg Miners' Institute (which gained him more access to books), and, in 1909, as a member of the executive of his local miners' lodge. He also joined the Independent Labour Party, and lectured in support of women's suffrage.<br>
<br>Davies's ten-year career as a miner was punctuated by two breaks, both indicative of his intellectual restlessness. In 1904 he experienced a conversion during the Welsh revival led by Evan Roberts, which made him resolve to train for the ministry. He enrolled at the Old College School in Carmarthen in order to gain qualifications, but under the influence of a friend, and to the chagrin of his parents, he converted to Unitarianism, and became a student pastor at the Unitarian Church in Aberystwyth. In 1907 he went to Summerville Unitarian College, in Victoria Park, Manchester, and also started taking pre-matriculation classes at Manchester University. He soon became bored by his studies and disaffected with Unitarianism, but developed a taste for playgoing at the Gaiety Theatre in Manchester. When his father became ill again, he was forced to return to his old job in the pit as the family's main breadwinner. His father's subsequent recovery led Davies to leave home and sign up as a stoker on a tramp steamer to New York. On his return to Britain he travelled around the country as a vagrant for several months before resuming his old job as a miner.<br>
<br>Reverting to his plan of entering the Congregationalist ministry, Davies entered Yorkshire United Independent College, Bradford, in 1912. He was sent to Edinburgh University as part of his training, but suffered a nervous breakdown and returned to Bradford. When his college closed in 1916, he was for a period a student minister in churches around the West Riding, before being ordained in October 1919. From then until October 1922 he was minister of Ravensthorpe Congregational Church, Dewsbury. At this time Davies was an exponent of the social gospel, and a convinced pacifist. His pacifism brought him into conflict with local businessmen, but into contact with prominent pacifists like Ramsay MacDonald, Charles Trevelyan, and W. E. Orchard. Through the No-Conscription Fellowship he also met Edith Firth (<i>d</i>. 1934), an elementary school teacher, daughter of William Firth, cashier. They married on 29 April 1918.<br>
<br>While at Ravensthorpe Davies became increasingly interested in the arts, helping found a branch of the Poetry Society in Dewsbury, where &#145;I found people who were intensely more intellectually alive and alert than any church people I knew&#146;  (Davies, 73). He became acquainted with the Leeds artist Jacob Kramer, through whom he also met Jacob Epstein. He put a photograph of Epstein's <span class="italic">Risen Christ</span> in the entrance to his church.<br>
<br>In October 1922 Davies moved to Hawkeshead Street Congregational Church, Southport, ignoring friends' warnings that the seaside town would not be a hospitable place for a socialist. He initially succeeded in increasing his congregation by laying on lectures, but his ministry was disrupted by bouts of rheumatism and depression. What energized him was the miners' lock-out of 1926, which, he later recounted, came as a kind of new religious awakening. On 9 May 1926 he preached to a packed church on &#145;Christianity and the miners' claim&#146; in which he declared &#145;the miners are altogether right and the owners are altogether wrong&#146;  (Davies, 86). This unequivocal support for the miners from a former miner lost Davies many members of his congregation, but he was able to replace them with working-class supporters. As a Congregationalist, he could not be disciplined by any superior ecclesiastical authority. Having acquired the sobriquet &#145;the Bolshie Parson&#146;, he was elected as the only Labour member of the borough council in 1926. He also stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in the parliamentary by-election at Lancaster in 1928. In April 1928 he resigned the Congregationalist ministry to set up a Labour church in Southport, but this only lasted for a year.<br>
<br>In 1929 Davies moved to London, without his wife, to seek work as a journalist. Unemployed, he was forced to sell most of his 3000-volume library to eke out a living. By this time, he later recalled, &#145;religion had ceased to matter at all. I never went near a church&#146;  (Davies, 109). He was rescued from penury by relatives of his wife, who offered him a temporary home in Enfield. His fortunes improved further when he attended a public meeting addressed by Dimitrije Mitrinovic, the Serbian mystic and utopian. Mitrinovic ran a number of movements in the early 1930s advocating causes like social credit and European federation, among them the New Britain movement and the Eleventh Hour Group. Mitrinovic installed Davies as editor of <span class="italic">New Britain Quarterly</span> and later as national organizer of the New Britain movement. Through this connection Davies encountered A. R. Orage and John Macmurray. At the behest of Mitrinovic he also underwent psychoanalysis and a traumatic form of group therapy. But he was increasingly unimpressed by social credit, which he thought &#145;nothing but confused nonsense&#146;, and by Mitrinovic, whom he thought a fantasist  (ibid., 128&#150;9).<br>
<br>Davies had by his own account grown apart from his wife in the early 1930s. But when she became seriously ill he nursed her, and they were reconciled before her death in March 1934. In his autobiography he admitted to feeling &#145;remorseful&#146; at her death  (Davies, 136). Months later, on 11 July 1934, he married Ruth Esther McCormick, a twenty-seven-year-old editorial secretary on the <span class="italic">New Britain</span>, and daughter of the late Samuel McCormick, a dentist, at Holborn register office. They had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>After breaking with Mitrinovic, Davies became drawn towards Marxism, under the influence of the former communist and general secretary of the Socialist League, J. T. Murphy. He joined the Socialist League, and read his way through Marx. But after quarrelling with Stafford Cripps and the league's other leaders, Davies and Murphy left to form their own campaign for a &#145;People's front against fascism&#146;. In March 1937 Davies went to Spain with Hewlett Johnson, dean of Canterbury, and John Macmurray, as part of a delegation investigating the treatment of the churches by the republican government. He was sympathetic to the republicans he met, but in Spain his belief in human progress was shattered by witnessing a column of refugees fleeing the bombing of Durango, and the body of a young soldier in a Bilbao morgue. Already before his visit he had begun to be disillusioned with Marxism because of Stalin's purges and his own reading of the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. This led to another psychological crisis. On a family holiday in Southerdown, south Wales, he attempted suicide by jumping into the sea, but managed to swim to safety, and found himself weeping on the shore. He was overcome by a powerful recollection of his mother teaching him the catechism. &#145;I heard her saying&#151;&#147;Who is Jesus Christ?&#148; to which I answered, &#147;Jesus Christ is my Saviour,&#148;&#146; he recalled. At this, &#145;a deep peace &hellip; flooded my inner being. I knew that I had passed through the great tribulation&#146;  (Davies, 190).<br>
<br>In the aftermath of this religious experience Davies wrote a book, <span class="italic">On to Orthodoxy</span>, arguing that recent international events had revealed the bankruptcy of liberal theology, and the need to return to a theology of original sin. The book was conceived during a walk on Hampstead Heath and written in five weeks. As Davies conceded, it was part of a wider shift towards a theology of sin already seen in the writings of Karl Barth and Reinhold Niebuhr, but it was more accessibly written, and its publication as war broke out in September 1939 gave its arguments particular resonance.<br>
<br>Davies returned briefly to the Congregationalist ministry in 1939 as pastor of Richmond Road Congregational Church, Cardiff, but was dismayed to discover how far Congregationalism had declined during his decade of absence. Seeking reception into the Church of England, he went to see Archbishop William Temple, who had been impressed by <span class="italic">On to Orthodoxy</span>, and who advised him to talk to Alec Vidler, warden of St Deiniol's, Hawarden. He embarked on a few months' study at St Deiniol's and had an experience of &#145;ecstasy&#146; on reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> for the first time  (Davies, 205). Vidler became a close friend, though he later began to worry that Davies had &#145;an almost one-track obsession&#146; with original sin  (Vidler, <span class="italic">Defenders of the Faith</span>, 100).<br>
<br>In 1941 Davies was ordained in York Minster by William Temple, and served as curate of St John's, Newland, in Hull, until 1943. For the remainder of his life he had charge of a succession of parishes in Dulwich (1943&#150;7), Brighton (1947&#150;9), St Leonards (1949&#150;58), and finally Parham, Sussex, at the foot of the South Downs. A striking figure with a mane of white hair, and a compelling orator, he was in great demand as a preacher, public speaker, and radio broadcaster. He also published a number of other books, and co-founded a magazine called <span class="italic">Pulpit Monthly</span> to raise the standard of Anglican preaching. Davies died, of meningitis and bronchopneumonia, at the Atkinson Morley Hospital, 31 Copse Hill, Wimbledon, on 1 November 1958. His widow saw through the posthumous publication of his autobiography, <span class="italic">In Search of Myself</span> (1961).<br>
<br>Davies was not unusual among inter-war British intellectuals in being attracted to varieties of socialism, Marxism, internationalism, and Christianity. What <i>was</i> unusual was the sheer number of belief systems he embraced, and his candour in describing his successive conversions. His autobiography owes much to traditional evangelical conversion narratives, but even allowing for a degree of retrospective self-fashioning, it offers a remarkable account of a working-class intellectual's political and spiritual odyssey in the first decades of the twentieth century.<br>
