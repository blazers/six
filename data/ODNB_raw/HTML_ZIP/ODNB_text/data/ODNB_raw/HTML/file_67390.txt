<span class="headword">Charlton,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">politician and conspirator</span>, was baptized on 16 May 1639 at Wellington, Shropshire, the son of Francis Charlton of Apley Castle, Shropshire (<i>d</i>. 1642), and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1661), the daughter of Osmary Hill. This younger Francis Charlton of Apley Castle, treasurer of the Rye House plotters in 1683 and an &#145;important though shadowy figure&#146; in the world of late Stuart radical politics, is not to be confused with his relative and namesake Sir Francis Charlton of Whitton Court, Shropshire, MP in 1679, 1681, and 1685, who acted consistently in the court interest  (Jones, 191).<br>
<br>Charlton came from a gentry family settled in Shropshire since the fourteenth century. His strongly puritan father died in 1642, and to protect the inheritance of the young boy and his older sisters&#151;Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1631) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67877/', "Margaret, later Baxter (bap. 1636, d. 1681)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1734/', "Baxter, Richard")</script>]&#151;in the midst of civil war his mother married again; her second husband was Robert Hanmer, a local royalist. The house and estate were nevertheless plundered by both sides, and the family fled to Essex. In 1655 at the age of sixteen Charlton married, possibly against his mother's wishes, Dorothy St John (<i>d</i>. 1689), daughter of Oliver St John, fifth Baron St John of Bletso, and a son, John, was born the following year. Probably in connection with this marriage Charlton waged a bitter struggle with his mother to gain control of the estate: he expected her to pay his debts, while she saw herself as fulfilling the terms of her husband's will in protecting the interests of her daughters. He called her a liar and threatened legal action, in July 1658 earning a truly biblical rebuke for this sin of filial disrespect from his future brother-in-law, the formidable puritan divine Richard Baxter, who married Margaret Charlton four years later. At some point, Charlton lost the use of one leg, and was known in adult life as &#145;Lame Charlton&#146; and even &#145;One-legged Charlton&#146; (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 496; Haley, 520).<br>
<br>In 1665 Charlton's politics were still sufficiently loyal for him to be made sheriff of Shropshire, but by the 1670s he was consorting closely with his cousin Anthony Ashley Cooper, the first earl of Shaftesbury. During the earl's first imprisonment in the Tower in 1677&#150;8 Charlton and his son, John, were among his most frequent visitors. As a close adviser to the earl Charlton then became deeply involved in the Popish Plot and exclusion crises. By his own admission he paid &pound;400 to Titus Oates &#145;for subsistence&#146;, and helped establish the credibility of another informer, Stephen Dugdale. He took a leading part in organizing and presenting the January 1680 &#145;monster petition&#146; urging closer investigation of the plot, paid for the printing of several thousand copies of pamphlets attacking the duke of York and supporting the duke of Monmouth's claim to legitimacy, and with Shaftesbury and Lord Herbert of Cherbury was one of three leading whigs who were made freemen of the important Skinners' Company of London in 1681. Government plans to put Shaftesbury on trial later that year were hampered by the expectation that Charlton would probably be foreman of any jury that was empanelled. Charlton was also important as a link between Shaftesbury and the duke of Monmouth's camp. He dined regularly with the duke, was often in the company of the latter's man of business Sir Thomas Armstrong, and was prominent among the midlands gentry who attended Monmouth in his quasi-royal tour of the area in September 1681, but neither he nor Armstrong could dispel the suspicion and mistrust which prevented any co-operation between their two principals.<br>
<br>Charlton's main role, however, was as treasurer to Shaftesbury's whigs. He received at least &pound;600 from the earl, contributed unknown sums of his own, and collected small donations of up to &pound;5 apiece from fifty-six prominent whigs. One conspirator believed he handled as much as &pound;3000. He spent the money subsidizing plot informers and conspirators such as Oates and Robert Ferguson, printing anti-court literature, and, more dangerously, ordering about two dozen muskets and other arms. He allegedly undertook to arm and mount the proposed band of forty Rye House assassins; and there was improbable talk of his raising &pound;10,000 to finance a Scottish rebellion by the duke of Argyll, to coincide with Shaftesbury's last desperate schemes. He did contribute &pound;1500 towards the earl's bail in 1681. When he was arrested in August 1683 an intimate of the duke of York argued that though Charlton was not actually one of the Rye House plotters, yet he supplied them with money and arms and &#145;was privie to all&#146;, and should therefore be very closely questioned  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;September 1683</i>, 249). The privy council examined four of his servants, questioned other plotters, searched his house, and subjected Charlton to two interrogations in the presence of the king, but no substantial charges could be proven and he was released with other prisoners early in 1684. He continued to meet with some discontented whigs, but though he was contacted before the 1685 uprising he refused to participate and fled to the Netherlands, where for some time he adopted a disguise. An arrest warrant was nevertheless issued for him, and he was excepted from the 1686 general pardon of rebels.<br>
<br>Charlton returned to England after the 1688 revolution but gained no favour from William, and in 1691 he was reduced to offering to discover Jacobite sympathizers in the north of England. His son, John, flourished, however, becoming a surveyor-general in the Ordnance office and in 1701 a deputy lieutenant for Middlesex. Besides his son, Charlton had two daughters, one of whom died in 1683. His wife, Dorothy, died in 1689, nine years before his own death from unknown causes in 1698.<br>
