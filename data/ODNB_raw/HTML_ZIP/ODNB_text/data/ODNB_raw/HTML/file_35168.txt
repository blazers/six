<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Murray, Sir  (John) Hubert Plunkett</span>  (1861&#150;1940), <span class="occ">colonial governor and judge</span>, was born on 29 December 1861, in Manly, near Sydney, New South Wales, the elder son of Dublin-born <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19647/', "Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810&#150;1873)")</script> and his second wife, Agnes Ann (<i>c</i>.1835&#150;1891), third daughter of Welsh-born John Edwards of Hammersmith, London, governess to her husband's two daughters and son from his first marriage. He was the elder brother of the classical scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35159/', "(George) Gilbert Aim&#233; Murray (1866&#150;1957)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation"></a>Early years and education</h2>Hubert's father lost his lands and his money through drought, sheep disease, and over-liberality in 1865. Hubert and his elder stepbrother were in the fine house near Lake George when bailiffs and creditors stripped its contents, before being driven over 200 miles of rough road in the middle of a storm to Sydney. There their mother maintained a close family circle in a succession of smaller and smaller urban households in support of her husband's continuing political career as president of the legislative council of New South Wales; he was knighted in 1869. It was also an educated household with a good library, for Sir Terence had been taught classics in Dublin, and his wife, a cousin of W. S. Gilbert, was a lively conversationalist and fluent linguist who, after her husband's death in 1873, ran a successful school for the young ladies of Sydney to support her family. Although Sir Terence was Roman Catholic, his religious views were liberal to the point of eccentricity, and he left their spiritual fortunes to his Anglican wife. Hubert was baptized into the Church of England as an infant, and only reluctantly did his father agree, in the face of outside pressure, to his Catholic baptism in 1869, a ceremony his father did not attend and which was not followed by regular religious practice by Hubert.<br>
<br>After preparatory school in Melbourne, Hubert was sent in 1872 to the Sydney Church of England grammar school, where he had a brilliant scholastic and athletic record, becoming captain of school. In 1878 he joined his mother, who had sold her school at a profit, and Gilbert in England, where he went to Brighton College. Having had a sound classical education in Sydney, Hubert gained a demyship of Magdalen College, Oxford, but he was expelled from Brighton for striking a master who had called him a wild Irishman. The intervening year, before he could go up to Oxford, he spent at a German academy at Sinzig Remagen. After he arrived in Oxford in 1881, he took firsts in classical moderations and Greats, graduating in 1886, but his associates in Oxford were not scholars but athletes and &#145;hearties&#146;, for he rowed and boxed and in 1885 was a member of the university athletics team. He ate his dinners at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1886, the year in which, under the auspices of the West London Boxing Club, and possessing a massive physique (standing 6 feet 3 inches and turning the scales at over 14 stone), he became amateur heavyweight champion of England under the Queensberry rules.<h2>
<a name="Legalcareer18861904"></a>Legal career, 1886&#150;1904</h2>With this impressive record Murray returned to Sydney in 1886. Admitted to the New South Wales bar, he then failed in private practice, attributing this to his Oxford education which repelled clients. His mother and others, however, described his aloof manner, his arrogant-seeming saunter, and an air of superiority, enhanced by his sense of a distinguished fighting Irish gentlemanly ancestry. Although in 1889 he married, in an Anglican church, Sybil Maud (<i>d</i>. 1929), fifth daughter of Richard Lewis Jenkins MD of Nepean Towers, a rich family friend, his income from the bar in that year was &pound;35 &#145;and rapidly approaching vanishing point&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 8). With the birth of a son, Terence, in 1891 and a daughter, Mary, in 1893, he was driven to accept a post as a parliamentary draftsman at &pound;700 p.a., work which &#145;will drive me into a lunatic asylum&#146;  (ibid., 9). His position, given his brilliant promise, seemed to him ridiculous, his &#145;living death&#146; only relieved by some crown prosecution work on circuit which, however, separated him from his family. When Gilbert visited Sydney in 1893, he detected in his brother signs of heavy drinking and of Roman Catholicism, with Sybil, although loving and patient, no real companion.<br>
<br>Murray tried to relieve his monotony by becoming a practising Catholic in 1896, and by joining a volunteer militia unit, the New South Wales Irish rifles, of which he became commanding officer in 1898. He was bitterly opposed to the South African War, but, thinking it his duty to his regiment, he sailed for Cape Town in command of troops aboard ship in January 1900. At first frustrated by command of a rear railway depot, he finally found some fighting, swimming the Modder River under fire, and then taking part in a dashing mounted infantry ride into Pretoria. He hated his subsequent duty of burning Boer farms, while, as part of a force vainly pursuing the Boer general De Wet, he formed a contempt for British officers, although he was himself commissioned into the imperial force as a major, and held the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Australian force. His younger son, Patrick, was born in England while he was in South Africa. Returning to Australia in 1901, his legal career was scarcely more successful, although he occasionally acted as a district court judge. The family separation had affected his wife, and he forswore alcohol. In 1904, in the hope that his wife could live with him for half the year, he applied for the post of chief judicial officer of British New Guinea, about to become the Australian Territory of Papua. But Port Moresby, the capital, then with fewer than fifty inhabitants, was too tropical, malarial, and primitive for his family, and he spent most of the rest of his life alone, except for periods of leave and occasional family visits to Port Moresby. His salary, however, enabled him to maintain his wife in Australia, and to educate his elder son in England and his daughter and younger son in Australia.<h2>
<a name="Judgeandlegaladviser19041908"></a>Judge and legal adviser, 1904&#150;1908</h2>As the only judge, sitting without jury or counsel, Murray had to administer a slightly adapted Queensland code. He inherited the view that in small stateless, chiefless, indigenous societies speaking some two hundred different languages there was no body of custom which could be codified, yet he became immediately aware that the motives for what were crimes under European law were Papuan ones. &#145;At present I do little or nothing but sentence people to death for murder&#146; Murray wrote to Lady Mary Murray on 24 October 1904  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 33), but Papuan custom he held to be a sufficient mitigating factor as to allow him to commute such sentences to a relatively short term of imprisonment. His intention was to educate in European ways prisoners who, in committing murder, had fulfilled Papuan social obligations. His judicial work led Murray to a fascinated interest in Papuan customs, an interest stimulated both by his own classical knowledge and by his acquaintance in Port Moresby with the anthropologist C. G. Seligman.<br>
<br>Murray was not only a judge. As legal adviser he was a member of the executive government. As such, he was drawn into the factions which divided the administration of Captain F. R. Barton during the interregnum between Britain's formal relinquishment of authority in March 1901 and the proclamation of the <span class="roman">Australian Papua Act</span> in September 1906. With division between a Colonial Office party and an Australian one in British New Guinea, Murray found his position difficult, especially when invited by Alfred Deakin, the Australian prime minister, privately and confidentially to offer his views on present and future policy and administration. When the Australian government decided on a royal commission to recommend policy, Murray by permission repeated in evidence what he had written to Deakin: Papuans were certainly protected, but development of a potentially rich possession was discouraged. In his opinion, the interests of Papuans and Europeans were not incompatible but the former must learn habits of industry, while the latter must be actively encouraged by government. The Australian government also took this view. Murray was appointed acting administrator in 1907 and then lieutenant-governor, the title adopted for the head of administration, in 1908. He retained the position of chief judicial officer, combining judicial circuit with inspections and some exploration of difficult country.<h2>
<a name="Enlightenedpolicies"></a>Enlightened policies</h2>Murray had drafted the native land and labour ordinances in 1906 in order to carry out Australian policy. The former provided that only the government could buy land from Papuans, and then make it available to Europeans for plantations, chiefly rubber and coconuts for copra, on thirty-year leases. Such land would be purchased only if Papuans were willing to sell and if it was surplus to their present and future needs. The latter allowed licensed private recruiters to bring labourers before a government officer to ensure that they were willing to engage under indenture, and that the numbers recruited were not so great as to cause the disintegration of their social group. Murray was satisfied that enough land was available to Europeans, and that there was sufficient labour to work it, without damaging the interests of the Papuans. By 1912 he believed that Papua could rely on the skill of the settlers&#151;over 140 plantations&#151;soon to dispense with the annual Australian subsidy of &pound;30,000, and to become self-supporting. Between 1906 and 1912, he reported, revenue had increased by 152 per cent, trade by 109 per cent, and shipping by 162 per cent.<br>
<br>Confident by 1911 that development by Europeans was well under way, Murray put forward a scheme to pacify the whole of still largely unexplored Papua, with an indigenous population estimated at 300,000. &#145;My scheme is to pacify the whole Territory first, and then tax the natives, the proceeds of the taxation being used to provide schools for them&#151;especially technical schools&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 71). He embarked on peaceful penetration, with new stations and more field staff to patrol, establishing government influence and then control, under strict orders never to fire unless their own or their native police escort's lives were at actual risk. &#145;When you are dead, you may shoot&#146;, was the Papuan service parody. The influence gained was maintained by the appointment of village constables, first introduced by Sir William MacGregor in the 1890s. When Murray wrote his book <span class="italic">Papua or British New Guinea</span> in 1912, his optimism about both development and native policy permeated it. He was appointed CMG in 1914.<br>
<br>Before the First World War Murray hoped for transfer to the imperial colonial service, with its chances of promotion to larger colonies, but he was disappointed. His optimism about Papua faded. The First World War reduced both his field staff and Papuan trade. After the war, the application of the <span class="roman">Australian Navigation Act</span> to Papuan shipping prevented recovery; when it was lifted, the great depression halted further development, despite unfulfilled hopes of oil and gold strikes. Murray was further disappointed when the former German colony of New Guinea was not combined with Papua under his governorship. In 1920, complaining that the Papuan government discriminated against Europeans, an unofficial meeting of residents of Port Moresby led to an ineffectual telegram to the king asking for Murray's removal from office.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Murray's reputation as an enlightened colonial governor grew, as he published his second book, <span class="italic">Papua of Today</span>, in 1925, and a dozen articles and addresses on native administration. The balance of Papuan and European interests that he proclaimed, although now inclined to stress Papuan protection, especially against European demands for labour, were not dissimilar to Lord Lugard's dual mandate nor to the League of Nations' &#145;sacred trust&#146;. As early as 1919 he had begun to look for a social anthropologist to assist his government's understanding of indigenous society. He claimed that in Papua he was true to the spirit of indirect rule, even if there was no chiefly system. It was in these years that the &#145;Murray policy&#146; was so named by his admirers, although later critics described it as benevolent paternalism. His achievement was recognized by advancement to KCMG in 1925, and by an address in 1937 from the unofficial residents of Papua, including former opponents.<br>
<br>Apart from the peaceful penetration of new country and some limited encouragement of indigenous development, however, primary education Murray left to missionary schools which were subsidized by the government. There was no development of village councils and local government, Papua being still a &#145;stone age&#146; country, not comparable with contemporary Africa or Asia. In any case, with revenue limited by the relative failure of development, with a small Australian subsidy, his resources were not adequate for education and training programmes.<h2>
<a name="Deathinoffice"></a>Death in office</h2>Despite public reputation, Murray in his sixties privately despaired. His first wife died in 1929; his second marriage in 1930 to Mildred Blanche Bloomfield, daughter of Henry Bloomfield Trench and widow of George Arthur Pomeroy Vernon, who also was unable to live in Port Moresby, ended in judicial separation in 1936. From May 1934 he suffered heart trouble, but was determined not to resign until he could be sure of a successor who would continue his policy. War, in 1939, filled him with horror and disgust. In February 1940 he set off on tour of south-east Papua in the government yacht in a mood &#145;to curse God and die&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Letters</span>, 241). Taken ill, he died in his sleep in the hospital at Samarai of lymphatic leukaemia on 27 February, his body taken for burial in the old cemetery at Port Moresby. After forty days of mourning, and watch fires burning on the hills, the Papuan ceremony concluded with the words: &#145;He promised us all &#147;I will not leave you. I will die in Papua.&#148; His words were the words of a true man, for his body lies in our ground&#146;  (West, 262).<br>
<br>Murray's colonial governorship of thirty-three years was unique. He successfully established law and order in Papua and early colonial development. Well-educated and intelligent, he reflected and wrote about the initial problems of colonial rule, bearing comparison, although he worked in a smaller sphere, to colonial governors such as Sir Donald Cameron, Sir Arthur Gordon, and Lord Lugard, and to the highest standards of his own day.<br>
