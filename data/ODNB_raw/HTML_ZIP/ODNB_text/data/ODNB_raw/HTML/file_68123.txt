</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Algarotti,  Francesco</span>, Count Algarotti in the Prussian nobility  (1712&#150;1764), <span class="occ">poet and scholar</span>, was born on 11 December 1712 in the family home in Venice on the Fondamenta Nuove, the second son of Rocco Algarotti (<i>d</i>. 1726) and his wife, Maria Mercati. His father was a prosperous merchant of Paduan origin, settled in Venice. His elder brother, Bonomo, was very close to him throughout his lifetime, both as a partner in many of his undertakings and as his main link with Venice during many years of absence.<br>
<br>Algarotti's education began in Venice, under the tutorship of Carlo Lodoli, but on his father's death in 1726 he was sent to Bologna, where he studied natural science and mathematics and established lifelong friendships with his tutors, Eustachio Manfredi and the Zanottis. It was here that Algarotti was first introduced to Newtonian optics. On leaving Bologna he went to Rome, where he met Martin Folkes, vice-president of the Royal Society of Arts, whose introductions facilitated his stay on his first visit to London in 1736. It was on his way to England that he met Mme du Ch&acirc;telet and Voltaire, both of whom shared his Newtonian interests and were impressed by the young Venetian.<br>
<br>Algarotti's first London visit was a triumph. Through Voltaire he met Lord Hervey, who opened many doors for him, including that of Queen Caroline, and his other introductions led to a fellowship of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries. During his lifetime Algarotti enjoyed a vast acquaintance with contemporaries throughout Europe, but his appreciation of England was of a special nature. His relationship with England originated from his Newtonian studies in the 1720s and 1730s, culminating in his <span class="italic">Newtonianismo per le dame</span> (1737), translated into English two years later by Elizabeth Carter. It developed during his three visits to London into an involvement in the English literary and artistic milieu of the period, and a lasting correspondence with many of its leading figures. Several of his works were dedicated to Englishmen, including the politicians Thomas Hollis and William Pitt and the diplomat Thomas Villiers; another was dedicated to W. T. How, through whom he became acquainted with the poet Thomas Gray. Algarotti's admiration for Palladio made him a natural friend of Lord Burlington, and he stayed at Chiswick House in 1739.<br>
<br>The youthful Algarotti was considered to be an engaging and outstandingly good-looking young man. The courtier Lord Hervey especially appreciated his combination of vivacity and mature taste. Algarotti's charm smoothed his way into the highest social circles (Voltaire called him the Swan of Padua) and into the affections of both men and women. Lord Hervey and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu were both deeply attracted to him and quickly became rivals for his affection. Lady Mary's infatuation for Algarotti subsequently directed the course of her life, prompting her move to Venice (1739) and Turin two years later. Here the relationship ended before a correspondence and friendship resumed fifteen years later. Despite his attractions, Algarotti's weaknesses did not escape the attention of his critics: his supposed snobbery, apparent frivolity, and the standard of his scholarship aroused criticism. His indecision and unwillingness to displease left his conclusions surrounded by qualifications. Such qualities did not sit comfortably with nineteenth-century English sensibilities. Thomas Carlyle, for example, dismissed him as &#145;a wearisome literary man &hellip; one of those half-remembered men whose books seem to claim a reading and do not pay you when given&#146;  (T. Carlyle, <span class="italic">History of Frederick the Great</span>, 1897, 3.327).<br>
<br>After his initial visit to England, Algarotti withdrew to France to complete his <span class="italic">Newtonianismo</span> and later to Italy to arrange for its publication in 1737. One of the best-known of Algarotti's works, the <span class="italic">Newtonianismo</span> appeared in Italy (the Naples edition of 1737 had a commissioned frontispiece by Piazzetta), in France, and in England (in Carter's translation). Despite its sound scholarship, this elegant popularization met with some complaints of inadequacy and of frivolity&#151;not unexpectedly from Horace Walpole. Disappointed, Algarotti did nothing serious until his return to England in 1739, facilitated by the generosity of Lady Mary. Here he repeated his earlier successes, culminating in an invitation from Lord Baltimore to accompany him on a diplomatic mission to Russia. This trip produced not only a series of letters to Lord Hervey (later to appear as <span class="italic">Viaggi di Russia</span>) but also, on his return journey, an introduction to Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia. Frederick was much taken with him, and on succeeding to the throne in 1740 immediately entreated him to return to Berlin. Welcomed into the king's inner circle, he was created a count in December and sent on a diplomatic mission to Turin in 1741. This proved unsuccessful, and when misunderstandings with the king arose in 1742 he left Berlin for several years.<br>
<br>It was now Algarotti's good fortune to be invited to Dresden by Augustus III, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, who created him a councillor of war and entrusted him with the reorganization and extension of the Dresden Gallery of Paintings. This involved spending time in Venice acquiring existing works and commissioning new ones, not least from Tiepolo. Algarotti's approach to the reorganization was highly innovative: rather than follow the personal tastes of the sovereign, he selected works to illustrate the development of the history of painting. The newly commissioned works were based on Algarotti's scholarship and on his assessment of each painter's individual style.<br>
<br>In 1746 Algarotti returned to Berlin; welcomed by the king, he was then made a chamberlain and a knight of the Order of Merit. His years here were a period of literary activity, which continued after his return in 1753 to Italy: to Venice, Bologna, and finally Pisa, where he found the climate beneficial to his failing health. It was in these later years that he encouraged and supported the young painter Mauro Tesi, of whom he was particularly fond, and to whom he left a generous bequest.<br>
<br>Algarotti died in Pisa on 23 May 1764 and was buried there in the campo Santo. His tomb was designed by Tesi and paid for by Frederick the Great, bearing the significant motto &#145;Algarottus non omnis&#146;  (Haskell, 360). His will included bequests to the eminent, including William Pitt and Frederick the Great, as well as to servants and friends. His collection of paintings, drawings, and books acquired jointly with his brother became the property of his niece Maria Corniani Algarotti and were catalogued for sale in 1776.<br>
<br>Algarotti's was a many-sided personality: he was both poet and scientist, scholar and writer. He remained in sympathy with the past yet was very conscious of the current trends of the Enlightenment and of neo-classicism, and it was these interests, together with his charming physical presence, which made him such a figure of both celebrity and controversy within the English cultural &eacute;lite of the mid-eighteenth century. Algarotti enjoyed considerable fame during his lifetime, and his works continue to be read with interest by historians of art and literature. Scholarship on him is vast and continuing, expanding far beyond the <i>aemulus</i> <i>Ovidii</i> and <i>Neutoni</i> <i>discipulus</i> of Frederick the Great's epitaph on him.<br>
