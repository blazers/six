<span class="headword">Oldmixon,  John</span>  (1672/3&#150;1742), <span class="occ">historian and political pamphleteer</span>, was the son of John Oldmixon, merchant, and Elinor Bawden (<i>d</i>. 1689). He belonged to an ancient Somerset family who held the manor of Oldmixon in the parish of Hutton, near Weston-super-Mare. The place and date of his birth are unknown: he described himself as a native of Bridgwater, although there is no entry in the registers of St Mary's Church in that town, where many members of his family can be traced.<h2>
<a name="Backgroundandearlyworks"></a>Background and early works</h2>Oldmixon's father, who was described as a gentleman in his will, which was dated 8 June 1675 and proved on 16 April 1679 by his daughters Hannah and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1689), bequeathed to his son &#145;my best cabinet in the little parlour, wherein my writings are now lodged&#146;. His mother's will, proved on 28 December 1689, was administered by her daughter Hannah (<i>b</i>. 1664/5) who had married Richard Legg in 1682, and by John. The older Oldmixon had been involved in bankruptcy proceedings in 1676, probably owing to losses in the Virginia trade, as emerges from a chancery suit later brought by his son. As a result the younger John was forced to mortgage the family estate of Oldmixon in 1696; later he failed to exercise a redemption option and the manor passed into other hands.<br>
<br>As a boy Oldmixon lived with Humphrey Blake, brother of Bridgwater's best-known native, Admiral Robert Blake. Humphrey was led by religious persecution to emigrate to Carolina, but Oldmixon continued to board in the home of his daughter and son-in-law, John Norman, a schoolmaster. In 1685 the boy witnessed the preliminaries to the battle of Sedgmoor as the duke of Monmouth climbed the church tower to reconnoitre the ground. Soon afterwards Oldmixon went to live with his maternal uncle Sir John Bawden, a prominent West Indies merchant who in 1669 had married Letetia Popham: she was the daughter of Edward Popham, Admiral Blake's principal lieutenant in the navy under the Commonwealth. Bawden, who lived in Stoke Newington, was an alderman of Aldersgate ward and a member of the council for Jamaica. He was knighted on 31 October 1687, as a Presbyterian willing to accept James II's declaration of indulgence. However, he died in the following year, leaving a small legacy to his sister Elinor Oldmixon, who was already in debt to him. John Oldmixon probably entered the family business while living with his uncle, but no details are known. More important was the protestant and whig inheritance he received from the Bawdens, Blakes, Pophams, and more distant kinsfolk such as Thomas, Lord Wharton. In addition he acquired enough specialist knowledge to compile an account of Robert Blake for <span class="italic">Lives English and Forein</span> (1704), which would be the principal source for Samuel Johnson's life of Blake (1740), and a fuller <span class="italic">History and Life of Robert Blake</span> in 1741. His book <span class="italic">The British Empire in America</span> (2 vols., 1708; 2nd edn, considerably augmented, 1741) draws on information from relatives and contacts in the family business, especially with regard to Barbados.<br>
<br>Oldmixon first appeared in print with poems in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Journal</span> in 1692 and 1693. His collection <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1696) was dedicated to Lord Ashley, later third earl of Shaftesbury: it consists mainly of lyric pieces, and several items were included in vocal miscellanies published by Henry Playford and others. In 1697 Oldmixon produced <span class="italic">An Idyll on the Peace</span> to celebrate the settlement at Rijswijk (Ryswick). It was the first of at least eight works of whig panegyric verse on topical themes, addressed to prominent patrons such as the duchess of Marlborough and the duke of Newcastle, which Oldmixon would issue until his poetic career effectively came to an end in 1714. A more original item appeared in 1703 as <span class="italic">Amores Britannici: Epistles Heroical and Gallant, in English Heroic Verse</span>. This anticipated the vogue for Ovidian epistles which was to blossom in the following decade, and in fact it is closer to Drayton's <span class="italic">Englands Heroicall Epistles</span> in conception and execution than to Ovid. In this period Oldmixon contributed prologues, epilogues, and miscellany verse to volumes by friends such as John Dennis and Charles Gildon. His phase as primarily a creative writer ended with his monthly journal <span class="italic">The Muses Mercury</span>, which lasted for thirteen issues in 1707&#150;8. Although Samuel Garth and John Dennis were regular contributors, and Rowe, Steele, and Wycherley appeared occasionally, Oldmixon had to cobble together much of the material himself. His greatest coup was to garner a contribution from Addison and to publish an appreciative essay on the old poem &#145;The Nut Brown Maid&#146;, which was to prove a pioneering study in the ballad revival.<br>
<br>At the same time Oldmixon was active in the theatre, with a short pastoral forming the first act of <span class="italic">The Novelty</span> (1697) by Peter Motteux and others, and then a full-length play taken from Tasso, <span class="italic">Amintas: a Pastoral</span> (1698). In 1700 he wrote the libretto for an opera by Daniel Purcell, <span class="italic">The Grove, or, Love's Paradice</span>: songs from this work were published by John Walsh. His last contribution to the stage came with a tragedy entitled <span class="italic">The Governour of Cyprus</span> (1703). None of these works seems to have enjoyed any great success in the playhouse. However, Oldmixon also kept his name before the public when he intervened in the Collier controversy with <span class="italic">Reflections on the Stage</span> (1699), dedicated to the future Lord Halifax. In January 1712 Oldmixon tried to enlist Halifax's support when, he claimed, John Ozell attempted to steal the credit for a translation of Boileau's works, published by Curll, and also dedicated to Halifax. According to Oldmixon, most of the volume had been his own doing. Oldmixon, described as a bachelor, was granted a licence to marry Elizabeth Parry, spinster, the daughter of George Parry, at Knightsbridge Chapel in March 1703. His wife was still apparently living in 1728. There are many casual references to a double family, and suggestions that Oldmixon may have had as many as six children. His known family consists of two sons and two daughters. John became a writer for Bengal in 1716, serving at Dacca for some years, and rose to be a senior merchant in the East India Company; he died in 1735. George worked in East India House, as chief of the department of the auditor of India accompts, and was a friend of the author John Hoole. He also wrote the English libretto for a &#145;serenata&#146;, <span class="italic">Parnasso in festa</span>, set by Handel in 1734. George died in 1779 aged sixty-six, leaving bequests to his two sisters, of whom the elder was Hannah (<i>c</i>.1705&#150;1789). The younger, Eleanora (<i>b</i>. 1721), became a singer and married John Marella. Her son John Marella Oldmixon had a play produced, was knighted in 1782, and subsequently emigrated to the United States, where he died <i>c</i>.1816.<h2>
<a name="Whigpamphleteer"></a>Whig pamphleteer</h2>From the time of the change of ministry in 1710 Oldmixon became a full-time polemicist on behalf of the whigs. He had already written the first part of <span class="italic">The History of Addresses</span> (2 vols., 1709&#150;11), and a flood of journalism and pamphleteering followed. He helped his friend Arthur Maynwaring to set up <span class="italic">The Medley</span>, a weekly paper which ran for forty-five issues from 5 October 1710 to 6 August 1711. This period coincided almost exactly with Swift's editorship of <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, which provided the main target and subject matter for the paper. Oldmixon served as managing editor, contributed to most issues, and wrote at least twelve issues single-handedly. The entire run was reprinted in May 1712, but the edition proved unsuccessful and Oldmixon was forced to bear the loss. Meanwhile he kept up his attack on Swift in a succession of pamphlets, including items responding to <span class="italic">The Conduct of the Allies</span>, <span class="italic">Some Remarks on the Barrier Treaty</span>, and <span class="italic">A Proposal for Correcting the English Tongue</span>, which is treated as a politically motivated project. An almost equally virulent barrage of pamphlets identified Defoe as a turncoat and lackey of the tory administration.<br>
<br>In 1716 Oldmixon claimed that since he had been diverted by Maynwaring from the study of history and poetry to politics, he had published more than a hundred tracts in defence of the whig cause through the booksellers Curll and Pemberton. Some twenty of these can be identified with certainty, usually issued under the imprint of the trade publisher James Roberts. These include <span class="italic">The Secret History of Europe</span> (4 vols., 1712&#150;15); <span class="italic">Arcana Gallica</span> and <span class="italic">The False Steps of the Ministry</span> (both 1714); <span class="italic">Memoirs of North-Britain</span> (1715); and <span class="italic">Memoirs of Ireland</span> (1716). Oldmixon also specialized in lives of the recently deceased, with biographies of Maynwaring, dedicated to Walpole (1715); Wharton, a kinsman by marriage (1715); and Somers (1716). He also compiled <span class="italic">The Conduct of the Earl of Nottingham</span> for Curll in 1716, but the earl's relatives got wind of the book when it was printed and caused publication to be suspended.<br>
<br>Pope somehow heard of this episode and mentioned it in one of his satiric pamphlets concerning Edmund Curll. Oldmixon had committed his first major offence against Pope when he reprinted an epigram entitled &#145;Two or Three&#146;, suppressed by Pope after its first anonymous appearance: this occurred in a miscellany edited by Oldmixon, <span class="italic">Poems and Translations</span>, which was published by Curll in April 1714. The pamphleteer compounded his offence when he helped the scandalous bookseller to issue <span class="italic">Court Poems</span> in March 1716, as the volume contained unauthorized printings of work by Pope's friends and attributed one item to Pope himself. A month later Oldmixon was responsible for a satire in verse called <span class="italic">The Catholick Poet</span>, which retailed familiar accusations regarding Pope's Jacobitism and his lack of Greek scholarship. Thereafter Oldmixon remained on Pope's list, with the result that he earned a niche in <span class="italic">Peri Bathous</span> and in successive recensions of <span class="italic">The Dunciad</span>, with a damaging note appended to the text of this poem. Oldmixon responded with hostile comments in the <span class="italic">Flying Post</span> in 1728, as well as a number of barbed references in his critical works, the most prominent of which were <span class="italic">An Essay on Criticism</span> (1728) and <span class="italic">The Arts of Logick and Rhetorick</span> (1728). The latter, dedicated to George Bubb Dodington, is chiefly based on <span class="italic">La mani&egrave;re de bien penser dans les ouvrages d'esprit</span> (1687) by the Jesuit priest Dominique Bouhours.<br>
<br>Oldmixon must have expected that his life would flow more smoothly after the Hanoverian accession, but the opposite proved true. He was in trouble with the authorities again in April 1716, when he assisted in the publication of an unofficial account of the trial of the Jacobite Lord Wintoun, which resulted in punishment for Curll and Pemberton at the bar of the House of Lords. Efforts to gain the post of consul at Madeira for Richard Miles, who was probably the son of his half-sister Elizabeth, proved unavailing, despite petitions to the customs commissioners and an imploring letter to Addison when the latter became secretary of state.<br>
<br>On 11 June 1716 Oldmixon finally obtained his only, belated reward for his loyalty, when he was appointed customs collector for the port of Bridgwater. His tenure lasted twenty years, but it was soon dogged by reverses. According to his <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Press</span> (published posthumously in 1742), he found the post unprofitable from the start, and in later years he claimed that his salary of &pound;100 was often in arrears. The strongly tory corporation harried him, and in 1718 he was compelled to appear before the mayor along with his friend Dr John Allen (<i>c</i>.1660&#150;1741) to explain riots in the street, while the parish clerk and sexton laid information that he was among those who had attended Presbyterian and Anabaptist conventicles. Oldmixon attempted to gain official favour by reporting on suspicious activities in the neighbourhood, as was no doubt expected of him by the ministry. In 1719 he sent long reports of a mysterious Swede who arrived in the estuary of the Axe near Uphill, and was examined as a possible agent implicated in the invasion mounted that year by the duke of Ormond with Spanish support. Two years later he sent news of the &#145;insolence and disloyalty&#146; of Jacobites on the birthday of the Pretender, James Stuart  (TNA: PRO, SP 35/27/23).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Oldmixon attempted to maintain his literary career. In 1714 he had contributed a version of &#145;Dejanira to Hercules&#146; to a new edition of <span class="italic">Ovid's Epistles</span>, originally published by Jacob Tonson with Dryden's collaboration in 1680. Now Oldmixon sought to interest Tonson in new work, including translations of the <span class="italic">Amores</span>, <span class="italic">De tristibus</span>, and the <span class="italic">Fasti</span> which ran to thousands of lines, along with extensive compilations on the history of Somerset and other counties, which occupied hundreds of sheets. None of this was published. Oldmixon complained to the Tonsons about difficulties and poor payment in relation to the index which he had compiled for Humphrey Prideaux's <span class="italic">Old and New Testament Connected</span> and volume 2 of Laurence Echard's <span class="italic">History of England</span>, both published in 1718. In December of that year Oldmixon wrote pathetically to Jacob Tonson sen., saying that he was &#145;banished in a corner of the country, surrounded with Jacobites, vilified, insulted and not having a minute's ease&#146;. He asked Tonson to make representations to the duke of Newcastle &#145;that I may succeed Mr Rowe in the laureate's place which I was to have had before, had it not been for him as Sir Samuel Garth knows&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 28275, fol. 46). The application was unsuccessful, as Laurence Eusden was very shortly appointed poet laureate. Oldmixon continued to hound the Tonsons with complaints about the treatment he received, his monetary troubles, and personal isolation in Somerset&#151;his wife was living in London all the while.<br>
<br>In 1724 Oldmixon became involved with James Brydges, duke of Chandos, who was pursuing land and business interests in Bridgwater. The main area of development lay in Castle Street, and Oldmixon rented one of the largest buildings in the street as the customs house. He also acted as agent for the duke's varied projects, and was invited to become a nominal partner in a glasshouse which Chandos had set up. The business connection survived, although under increasing strain, until 1731, by which time the duke had grown impatient with Oldmixon's financial management and had refused to pay sums which were the responsibility of the customs commissioners.<h2>
<a name="Historicalwritings"></a>Historical writings</h2>During the 1720s Oldmixon shifted his principal concern as a writer to historiography. He had in fact taken a leading share with John Hughes in the compilation of <span class="italic">A Complete History of England</span> (1706), a cento of older sources supplemented by a section on recent history by White Kennet. He now began a series of strongly whig narratives which focused chiefly on the seventeenth century and singled out Clarendon's <span class="italic">History of the Rebellion</span> for particular reprobation, with Echard a secondary target. The prime documents are <span class="italic">The Critical History of England</span> (2 vols., 1724&#150;6); <span class="italic">A Review of Dr Zachary Grey's Defence of our Ancient and Modern Historians</span> (1725); and <span class="italic">Clarendon and Whitlock Compar'd</span> (1727). It was in 1729 that controversy really flared, with the appearance of Oldmixon's massive <span class="italic">History of England, during the Reigns of the Royal House of Stuart</span>. In this he expanded earlier hints and accused Clarendon's editors&#151;Francis Atterbury, Henry Aldrich, and George Smalridge&#151;of falsifying the text of the <span class="italic">History</span>. He printed an anonymous letter, written by George Duckett, which supported this contention, on the basis of statements made to Duckett by Edmund Smith in 1710. An extensive debate was set off by these charges, with contributions by Atterbury himself and others, as well as three further interventions by Oldmixon himself. The <span class="italic">History of the Stuarts</span> also provoked the elderly tory Lord Lansdowne into vindicating his ancestors General Monk and Sir Richard Grenville. This in turn prompted a pamphlet in response from Oldmixon. A decisive rebuttal of all the charges against the editors was made by John Burton in <span class="italic">The Genuineness of Lord Clarendon's &#145;History of the Rebellion&#146;</span> (1744). Later scholarship has confirmed Burton's position.<br>
<br>Oldmixon was now in his sixties and suffering poor health, but he still kept up a frenzied pace. His gigantic history of England was completed with two long folios devoted respectively to the reigns of William and Mary, Anne, and George I (1735), and to the Tudors (1739). There were new editions of several of his works, including the long popular work of political soothsaying, <span class="italic">Nixon's Cheshire Prophecy</span> (<i>c</i>.1715), which celebrated the Hanoverian accession, and reached its &#145;fifteenth&#146; edition by Curll in 1744&#151;it was still being published into the nineteenth century. Meanwhile Oldmixon had been forced to relinquish his customs post in 1736, and soon afterwards lost a royal bounty paid at the instance of Queen Caroline until her death in 1737. He was saddled with a large debt to the crown, incurred as he claimed by his deputy, and petitioned the Treasury for relief in 1740. More efficacious was a personal letter of appeal to the duke of Newcastle in the following year, which resulted in a grant of &pound;50 from the royal bounty. He told the duke that he had been dragged &#145;to a place I cannot mention in the midst of all the infirmities of old age, sickness, lameness and almost blindness&#146;, a poor reward for his services for &#145;that good cause I have all my life long laboured to serve in the worst of times&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32697, fol. 308).<br>
<br>After many years of ill health, Oldmixon died at his home in Great Pulteney Street, London, on 9 July 1742, with his age listed in the press as sixty-nine. He was buried three days later at St Mary's, Ealing, near an unidentified son and daughter. Later that month there appeared Oldmixon's most vivid and arresting book, his posthumous <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Press</span>, which sets out in detail the calamities of authorship as he had experienced them. It is a record of ingratitude and disregard suffered at the hands of those such as Walpole whom Oldmixon had expected to reward him for his services to the whig cause.<br>
