<span class="headword">Perrot,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1478&#150;1550), <span class="occ">church musician and land speculator</span>, was the second son of George Perrot, gentleman, of Haroldston, near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, and Isabel Langdale of Langdale, near Scarborough, Yorkshire. He was born at Hackness, immediately neighbouring Langdale. Of his education and musical training nothing is known, though an early connection with Oxford is rendered conceivable through the possibility that Robert Parret, organ player in 1474&#150;5 of All Saints', Oxford, was of his family. For a suitably talented younger son of gentry stock a career in church music was perfectly honourable in pre-Reformation times, and between Michaelmas 1504 and Michaelmas 1506 Perrot was appointed a lay singing-man of the choir of King's College, Cambridge, and remained so until June 1509. At Michaelmas 1510 he was admitted master of the choristers of Magdalen College, Oxford, where his duties were to train the singing-boys and direct all performances of polyphonic music sung during the chapel services; he did not undertake the duties of organist, which were discharged by a separate individual. On 28 April 1512 he was appointed cantor and master of the lady chapel choir at Durham Cathedral, but chose not to accept; a certain streak of financial opportunism may be perceived in his exploiting this offer merely to negotiate better terms for his remaining at Magdalen.<br>
<br>As a musician Perrot enjoyed much distinction. During 1507&#150;8 he obtained the Cambridge degree of bachelor of music (a non-residential degree generally conferred for expertise in composition), and in February 1516 he supplicated the University of Oxford for admission to the doctorate. This was granted, conditional upon his composing a mass and a companion piece of sacred music. There is no record of the degree having been conferred, and it is probable that Perrot did not proceed; never was he accorded the title &#145;Doctor&#146; in the Magdalen archives. At Michaelmas 1529 he added to his duties those of chapel organ player. His career at Magdalen appears to have been entirely uneventful, his appearances in the surviving records being of only the most routine kind. No compositions have been preserved.<br>
<br>During 1531&#150;2 Perrot undertook an extraordinary change of occupation. He surrendered his office of master of the choristers, retaining among his chapel duties only those of organist, which&#151;evidently as merely a hobby occupying him for but a few hours per week&#151;he retained for the rest of his life. He ventured upon a new career as a financial agent and speculator in landed property, especially properties formerly mendicant and monastic. Through this he achieved such prosperity that by 1543 he was among the wealthiest of Oxford's taxpayers, dwelling in a large house adjacent to Magdalen College known until the nineteenth century as Perrot's House. Of his first wife, Joan, nothing is known. By 1505 he had married his second wife, Alice Gardiner (<i>c</i>.1487&#150;1557), the daughter of a minor family of Berkshire/Oxfordshire gentry; they had seven sons and six daughters. Having made his will on 18 April, he died aged seventy-two &#145;or thereabouts&#146;, at Oxford, probably at his home, on 20 April 1550. He was buried in the north aisle of the parish church of St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, where once stood a memorial window depicting &#145;Robertus Porret, Bacalaureus Musices&#146;, kneeling at his devotions. He bequeathed numerous properties and leases, all located in Oxford and its immediate vicinity.<br>
<br>Perhaps through lack of sympathy with the Edwardian Reformation, Perrot made no bequest to Magdalen College. However, the restoration of Catholicism under Mary I gave his widow the opportunity in 1555 to found in his memory exhibitions for two poor scholars, and both an annual obit and twice-weekly intercessory prayers in the college chapel. In recognition of Robert's service as master of the choristers, special financial provision was made for the attendance of the boys and their master at his obit, and stringent penalties upon the college attended any failure to pay. In consequence of the abolition of the Latin service (1559), the terms of Alice Perrot's provisions had eventually to be reformulated. She had died on 1 May 1557, and it seems entirely likely that Magdalen College's annual &#145;May morning&#146; observance by the choristers and their master on top of Magdalen tower, picturesque and now very celebrated, has its origin in a post-Reformation secularization of Alice Perrot's memorial benefaction for her husband.<br>
