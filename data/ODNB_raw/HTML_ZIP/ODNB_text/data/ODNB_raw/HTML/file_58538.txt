<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gardner,  (Leslie) James</span>  (1907&#150;1995), <span class="occ">designer and graphic artist</span>, was born on 29 December 1907 at 26 Stacey Road, Hendon, Middlesex, the son of Frederick James Gardner, a commercial traveller, and his wife, Flora May, formerly Jarvis. He was brought up in somewhat unhappy family circumstances in suburban London. Awarded a council scholarship to Westminster School of Art, where his teachers included Randolph Schwabe and E. McKnight Kauffer, he was taken on in 1923 as an apprentice at Cartiers the jeweller of Bond Street, London, where he remained for six years. After a period travelling abroad for much of the 1930s he was employed at Carlton Studios, a leading London-based commercial design consultancy. On 20 February 1935 he married (Violet) Mary, daughter of William John Williams, at Brentford, Middlesex. During the 1930s he came into contact with Jack Beddington of Shell, for whom he carried out poster production and early work in exhibition design, the field in which he was to become a defining practitioner.<br>
<br>Gardner established his reputation after the Second World War, during which he had been involved with the Camouflage Training School, working alongside the couturier Victor Stiebel and the set designer Oliver Messel. He was appointed as chief designer for the landmark &#145;Britain Can Make It&#146; exhibition of 1946, the first of a series of commissions for the Council of Industrial Design; these included the &#145;Enterprise Scotland&#146; exhibition of 1947 and the &#145;Festival of Britain&#146; of 1951. For the latter he served as a design panel member and the design co-ordinator of the whimsical Battersea pleasure gardens. A number of other important official commissions followed, including the British government pavilion at the Brussels World Fair of 1958 and the British contribution to the Montreal World Fair of 1967. In the latter he portrayed the dynamic, creative side of life in Britain in the 1960s, including in his display Carnaby Street fashions and an Austin Mini decorated with the union flag. One of his most significant achievements in museum design was the Evoluon Museum (1966) for Philips in Eindhoven. His pioneering work on museum displays was remarkable in the ways in which the complexities of science, technology, and history were made accessible without being patronizing. As well as working on a series of important commissions including the Pilkington Glass Museum (1965), the &#145;Story of the Earth&#146; exhibition (1972), and the &#145;Britain before Man&#146; exhibition (1977) at the Geological Museum, London, in 1972, Gardner was involved in mainstream industrial design and interior design commissions. These included a prestigious commission from Cunard to design the superstructure and interior for their ocean liner <i>QE 2</i>, for which he supervised work in 1966.<br>
<br>For much of the rest of his productive life Gardner worked on a wide range of significant national and international projects, such as the Museum of the Diaspora in Tel Aviv (1978), though for a while the recession of the 1980s constrained his prolific output. None the less, with the assistance of Martin Pyant and Eve Harrison he won further important commissions, including the Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan (1988) and the Museum of Intolerance, Los Angeles (1993). In 1989 he was awarded the medal of the Chartered Society of Designers for outstanding achievement in industrial design.<br>
<br>Although never self-consciously stylish in his dress in the manner of many designers in the later twentieth century, Gardner's appearance in later life perhaps singled him out as &#145;arty&#146;. He was a pipe-smoker who often looked out quizzically over his black, thick-rimmed glasses, his brushed-back hair longer than that of many of his contemporaries. He also often sported a polo-neck sweater beneath a corduroy jacket with pens, emblematic of his profession, visible in its breast pocket. His autobiographical writings, <span class="italic">Elephants in the Attic</span> (1983) and <span class="italic">James Gardner, the ARTful Designer: Ideas off the Drawing Board</span> (1993), reveal both his strengths and his weaknesses. Evident in both is a complete belief in his own professional abilities as a designer, together with an absolute reluctance to &#145;suffer fools&#146;. An air of irreverence and, at times, flippancy pervaded the prose that G (as he was known to many fellow designers) produced. Its somewhat raffish, casual, and throwaway style made light of the genuine importance of his contribution to design, though the many drawings that accompanied the text revealed the eloquence and facility of his draughtsmanship. These books also reveal his general sense of self-containment, a strong sense of living for his work, and a reluctance to give away significant details about his private life. Similarly, his sketches and designs have not been systematically preserved since, after completing work, Gardner was prone to give them&#151;or even throw them&#151;away, their immediate purpose having been fulfilled. Gardner was also capable of writing a very good book about the profession itself, as in <span class="italic">Exhibition and Display</span> (1960), which he co-wrote with Caroline Heller.<br>
<br>James Gardner died in the Middlesex Hospital, London, on 25 March 1995. It was within the museum and exhibition design profession that he was best known and where the true originality of his design solutions has been recognized. He was considered by Hugh Casson as &#145;perhaps the most inventive, versatile and prolific designer in the UK&#146; for more than half of the twentieth century. Although a highly significant figure in the history of design, unlike an increasing number of designers in the latter half of the twentieth century he rejected the cult of personality and devoted himself to his work.<br>
