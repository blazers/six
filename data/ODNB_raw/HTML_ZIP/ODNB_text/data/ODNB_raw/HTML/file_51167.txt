<span class="headword">Jones, Sir  Glyn Smallwood</span>  (1908&#150;1992), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 9 January 1908 at 24 Edna Street, Hoole, Chester, the first of two children of Gwilym Ioan Jones (1877&#150;1943), grocer's assistant, and his wife, Agnes (1886&#150;1960), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Roberts, milliner. His parents were both Welsh, but moved to Chester a few years before he was born. Though Welsh-speaking Calvinistic Methodists, they sent their son to the English-speaking Methodist church. His primary education was at the local council school. His secondary education was at the King's School, Chester, a day school close to his home. At King's School he became head boy, house captain, and captain of soccer, boats, and swimming. He also sang and played the piano and organ. His academic accomplishments were good, though not remarkable. In 1927 he was admitted to St Catherine's Society, Oxford (as St Catherine's College was then called), as a non-collegiate student, reading English and financed by a government grant for training teachers. He was a leading member of St Catherine's debating society and was a soccer blue. In 1930, with a third-class degree, and failing to secure a teaching appointment, he joined the tropical services course at Oxford, and a year later was appointed administrative cadet in Northern Rhodesia.<br>
<br>From 1931 to 1951 Jones  (or Jonas, as he was affectionately known) served as cadet, district officer, and district commissioner in the Zambezi valley, the north-west, the copperbelt (where he distinguished himself in a dangerous mine riot), the eastern province, and Barotseland. On 21 May 1938, on leave, he married Margaret Florence (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1912), daughter of Peter McWilliam, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club's manager and a former Scottish international. His wife did not return to Africa with him. On his return he was appointed secretary of the MacDonnell inquiry into a dispute between the Lozi (Barotze) paramount chief and the Luvale chiefs. On 7 November 1942, now divorced, he married a nurse, Nancy Madoc (1909&#150;1998), daughter of John Henry Featherstone of Cape Province, South Africa. He was made an MBE in 1944. Their daughter, Elisabeth, was born in 1944 and their son, Timothy, in 1946.<br>
<br>Jones became commissioner for native development in 1951. Appointed provincial commissioner in 1955, he served on the copperbelt&#151;where again he dealt with mine riots&#151;and as resident commissioner of Barotseland. He was appointed CMG in 1957. The governor, Sir Arthur Benson, made him secretary (later restyled minister) of native affairs in 1958, primarily because they shared a profound belief in the importance and continuing governmental role of the traditional chiefs. In 1958 the Colonial Office wished to appoint a new chief secretary in neighbouring Nyasaland. One of the two officers being considered was a Northern Rhodesia provincial commissioner junior to Jones on whose suitability his advice was sought late in 1959. Three months later Jones was himself offered the post and accepted it. He arrived in Nyasaland in February 1960. While the governor, Sir Robert Armitage, was on leave from August to November 1960 Jones was acting governor. Dr Hastings Banda, the Malawi Congress Party leader, who had been released in April after detention during a state of emergency, exerted pressure on Jones to release the remaining hard-core detainees, warning that he could not prevent major disturbances unless they were released. In exchange for an undertaking&#151;soon broken&#151;that Banda would control them, Jones released the detainees. Two weeks later he was advanced to KCMG.<br>
<br>When Armitage left Nyasaland on retirement on 10 April 1961, Jones became governor. Devoted to the welfare of the Nyasaland people, he was convinced that Banda was the only person able to secure that welfare&#151;a view Banda shared. During the following three years his constant preoccupation was to support Banda, keep him in power and prevent him withdrawing co-operation with the British government. This task involved repeated capitulation to Banda's demands. To do otherwise would, in his judgement, have incurred widespread violence controllable only by external military forces, a prospect not to be contemplated. Given their joint belief in Banda's indispensable role, Jones and Banda developed a working relationship which took the country through self-government and secession from the Central African Federation in 1963 to July 1964 when, as Malawi, it became independent, with Banda as prime minister and Jones, now appointed GCMG, as governor-general. Shortly after independence a ministerial revolt resulted in the dismissal or resignation of all but one of Banda's ministers. Banda asked Jones if his staying on as prime minister was in Malawi's best interests and received an expected, promptly accepted, affirmative answer. Though agreeing with the ministers' objections to Banda's policies and autocratic methods, Jones tried to support him and desperately, but unsuccessfully, to effect a reconciliation. The former ministers fled the country, some with Jones's help&#151;and Banda's agreement&#151;and he long stayed in touch with them, trying to effect their return and a reconciliation.<br>
<br>When Malawi became a republic in July 1966 Jones retired to England but did not sever his African ties. He was successively head of the Malawi Buying and Trade Agency in London, adviser to the Lesotho government, deputy chairman of the Pearce commission on Rhodesian opinion (appointed to assess African opinion on the proposed constitutional settlement drafted by Sir Alec Douglas-Home and Ian Smith), observer at the Rhodesia-Zimbabwe elections in 1980, and chairman of numerous African charities, including the Friends of Malawi Association and the Zimbabwe Trust. He died of liver failure at his home, Little Brandfold, Goudhurst, Kent, on 10 June 1992. He was cremated and his ashes were taken to Malawi and placed next to the remains of his son, who had died in 1961, in Zomba cemetery.<br>
