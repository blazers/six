<span class="headword">Clifton,  Francis</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1736), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the fourth and youngest son of Josiah Clifton, merchant, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and his wife, Mary, only child of Thomas Fenne of the same town. Choosing to join the medical profession, he entered Leiden University on 23 May 1724, and graduated as doctor of medicine there in September of the same year. His inaugural dissertation, &#145;De distinctis et confluentibus variolis&#146;, was later published.<br>
<br>Clifton afterwards settled in London, where his classical and scientific learning won him the friendship of many eminent men, among them Sir Hans Sloane, on whose proposition he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 22 June 1727. The same year he published <span class="italic">Hippocratis Coi operum quae extant omnium secundum leges artis medicae dispositorum, editionis novae specimen</span>, and in 1732 he published a proposal to print a new edition of the works of Hippocrates; however, lack of sufficient subscriptions meant that it never appeared. Clifton received the honorary degree of MD from Cambridge on 26 April 1728, during the visit of George II; he was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 23 December in the same year and a fellow on 22 December 1729, and gave the Goulstonian lectures in 1732. He also held the appointment of physician to the prince of Wales, which he resigned in 1734, when he abruptly left London for Jamaica.<br>
<br>Writing to Sir Hans Sloane from Kingston, Jamaica, on 3 June 1736, Clifton says: &#145;My misfortunes came so fast upon me, and my brother's provocations were so frequently repeated, that I was hurried in a manner to death about 'em&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 4041, fol. 9). He died there a few weeks afterwards, leaving a widow, Sarah Banckes, daughter of a merchant in Leadenhall Street, London. There were no children of the marriage. In the letters of administration granted on 6 November 1736 to his widow, Clifton is described as &#145;late of the parish of St George, Hanover Square, Middlesex, but at Kingston in Jamaica, deceased&#146;. His widow survived until 1747, and was buried in the parish church of St Andrew Undershaft  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/754, sig. 145).<br>
<br>At the time of his death Clifton was engaged in drawing up an account of the diseases of Jamaica, but left it unfinished. Among his other works was <span class="italic">The State of Physick, Ancient and Modern, Briefly Considered</span>, in which he maintained that Hippocrates had anticipated Newton in his idea of the system of gravitation. A French version by the Abb&eacute; Desfontaines was published at Paris in 1742.<br>
