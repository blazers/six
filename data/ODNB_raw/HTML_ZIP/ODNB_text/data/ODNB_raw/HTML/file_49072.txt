<span class="headword">Harford family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1700&#150;1866), <span class="occ">merchants, brass manufacturers, and bankers</span>, came to prominence with Charles Harford (1631&#150;1709). He and his immediate descendants were Quakers. Charles Harford, the first Harford to enter trade in Bristol, was the son of Mark Harford (1570&#150;1652) of Marshfield in Gloucestershire. He was active in soap-boiling in the 1680s and 1690s, and in plans to set up a brassworks in 1700. In an eventful life he was among many Bristol Quakers imprisoned for not attending national worship, and in 1691 he was fined heavily for customs fraud. By his first marriage in 1656, to Mary Bushe (<i>d</i>. 1667), Charles Harford had six children. His second son, Charles Harford the younger (1662&#150;1725), merchant, was the father of Trueman Harford (1704&#150;1750), father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49071/', "James Harford (1734&#150;1817)")</script>, iron and tin-plate manufacturer. His eldest son, Edward, was the head of the three branches of the family in brass-making and banking.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_66967"></a><span class="headword">Edward [i] Harford</span>  (1658&#150;1705)<span class="occ"></span> continued in his father's trade of soap-making and married Elizabeth Jones (1670&#150;1729) in 1689; they had ten children. He expanded into the tobacco trade, and became part-owner of a ship. His three grandsons in the separate Blaise Castle, Stapleton, and Stoke Bishop lines became especially prominent.<br>
<br>The Stoke Bishop line was the branch most intimately involved with brass-making. It began with Mark [i] Harford (1700&#150;1788), eighth child of Edward [i] Harford and Elizabeth Jones. Mark [i] Harford was a haberdasher of small wares who became connected with the brass trade through his marriage to Love Andrews, granddaughter of one of the founders of the Bristol Brass Company. The company was begun as the Bristol Brass Wire Company in 1702 by Quaker merchants including John Andrews, Nehemiah Champion, Thomas Coster, Abraham Darby, and Edward Lloyd, and it dominated the British brass trade for nearly a century. Mark [i] Harford's only child, <a name="cosubject_66968"></a><span class="headword">Mark [ii] Harford</span>  (1738&#150;1798)<span class="occ"></span> of Stoke Bishop, increased the family's stake in the company by marrying Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1798), daughter of Samuel Lloyd, in 1762, and became its leader. In the following years it became one of the most important industrial enterprises in the world, owning copper mines, smelters, and brassworks, in Cornwall, Bristol and its environs, Esher in Surrey, Lower Redbrook in the Wye valley, and Swansea. Mark [ii] Harford headed a committee of nine, on which sat five Harfords, including his first cousins Edward [iii] and Joseph, of the Blaise Castle and Stapleton branches. He reorganized the company in 1788 as the Harford and Bristol Brass and Copper Company with additional capital of &pound;100,000 and ten members, of whom six were Harfords.<br>
<br>Mark [ii] Harford retired in 1796, and leadership of the company passed for six years to his cousin Joseph Harford of Stapleton before returning to his second son, Mark [iii] Harford (<i>b</i>. 1768). In 1799 it could still be described by its chief rival, Thomas Williams, as &#145;perhaps the most considerable brass house in all Europe&#146;  (Day, 112). However, it was already declining and was managed largely as a static investment. The company continued to use slow methods to make traditional goods such as brass ingots and wire, copper sheets, and battery-ware pans and kettles. By contrast the Birmingham industry was developing new techniques and products such as gas fittings and machine components. The industrial empire began to fall apart, and even its central sites were allowed to decay. Woodborough battery mill was derelict by the 1790s, Weston battery mill was sold about 1811, and Baptist Mills was abandoned around 1814. All smelting had ceased by 1820. From 1833 the company was simply a property owner, with its remaining premises leased for &pound;500 per annum; it was sold by the Harford family in 1862.<br>
<br>The Stapleton line originated with Charles Harford (1704&#150;1746), grocer, youngest child of Edward [i] Harford and Elizabeth Jones. Charles married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1742), the daughter of Joseph Beck of Frenchay and niece of one of the partners in the Old Bank. Their sons were Trewman Harford (<i>fl</i>. 1727&#150;1761), merchant, and <a name="cosubject_66969"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Harford</span>  (1741&#150;1802)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Frenchay, Bristol. Joseph Harford's commercial interests were based upon his father's wholesale grocery business in Queen's Square, but he extended into important new areas. He was a founding partner of the New Bank in 1786 and a partner in the bank of Ames, Cave &amp; Co. from 1786 to 1798. He was a member of Merchant's Hall, and master of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1796. His industrial interests centred on the Bristol Brass Company, of which he was a committee member, and leader from 1796 to 1802, but he also had interests in the iron, tin, and glass trades, and financed Richard Champion's Bristol China Works in 1768.<br>
<br>Joseph Harford aggrandized the family by marrying in 1763 Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1811), daughter of Joseph Kill of Stapleton Grove, near Bristol, where they took up residence. He became a justice of the peace, treasurer of Bristol Infirmary, promoter of the Bristol Library Society, and chairman of the Bristol slavery abolition committee. He was prominent in Bristol politics during the radical campaign of 1769 and was in 1771 one of Edmund Burke's two sponsors to become a member of parliament, opening his campaign with a subscription of &pound;300. Burke said, &#145;You could not have a better man than Mr Harford. He has a great bottom for confidence. He has a firm Integrity; very enlarged notions; and one of the most solid and well cultivated understandings I have met with&#146;  (Underdown, 137). Harford himself was elected to Bristol common council in 1779 and acted as high sheriff on three occasions. The Society of Friends disavowed him for taking his oath, resulting in his conversion to the Church of England. Joseph Harford died at Stapleton Grove on 11 October 1802.<br>
<br>The Blaise Castle descendants of Edward [i] Harford and Elizabeth Jones sprang from their son Edward [ii] Harford (1691&#150;1779), merchant, who married Elizabeth Lloyd, daughter of Edward Lloyd of the Brass Company. Edward [ii] expanded his father's mercantile and industrial interests, beginning to import tobacco from Virginia in 1724 and owning a ship, taking a partnership in a glassworks in 1724, and holding membership of the Brass Company. His business was carried on by his only child, <a name="cosubject_66970"></a><span class="headword">Edward [iii] Harford</span>  (1720&#150;1806) of Frenchay, <span class="occ">merchant</span>, who joined the committee of the Brass Company. Unlike his father, he became a Merchant Venturer and was progenitor of the family's lucrative banking interests, leading the six original partners in creating the Harford Bank in 1769. In 1747 he married Sarah Scandrett (1725&#150;1776) of Birmingham, the daughter and heiress of John Scandrett (<i>d</i>. 1730), who was also related to the Lloyds. Of their seven children, only one survived him: <a name="cosubject_49072"></a><span class="headword">John Scandrett Harford</span>  (1754&#150;1815)<span class="occ"></span>.<br>
<br>John Scandrett Harford ensured the transition of his line from commerce to landed gentry; this was to be consolidated by the conversion of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12311/', "John Scandrett Harford the younger (1787&#150;1866)")</script> to the Church of England, as well as the latter's advantageous marriage and literary concerns. The elder J. S. Harford maintained the family's industrial interests as a committee member of the Brass Company, and as an iron merchant and a partner in Lydney ironworks in Gloucestershire. He continued as the leading partner of Harford's Bank until his death. In 1782 he was warden, and in 1798 master, of the Bristol Merchant Venturers' Guild. He married another Quaker, Mary Gray (<i>d</i>. 1830) of Tottenham, Middlesex, in 1780, and they had nine children. By his death he was said to have trebled the fortune inherited from his father nine years earlier, and left nearly &pound;300,000. He lived at Brunswick Square, Bristol, until 1789, when he purchased the Blaise Castle estate, near Bristol; this signified perhaps the greatest single step in the gentrification of the Harfords. He built a grander house to designs by William Patey about 1795, and commissioned additions by John Nash, Humphry Repton, and George Stanley Repton. He is best remembered for Blaise Hamlet, the estate pensioners' houses built by Nash in 1810&#150;11 at a cost of &pound;3800, one of the most successful examples of picturesque architecture in England now in the care of the National Trust. J. S. Harford the elder died at Blaise Castle on 23 January 1815.<br>
<br>The Harford family, through its principal Bristol branches, formed a major business empire. This advanced fastest in the generation of the mid- to late eighteenth century led by the first cousins Joseph Harford (1741&#150;1802) of Stapleton, Edward [iii] Harford (1720&#150;1806) of the Blaise Castle line, and Mark [ii] Harford (1738&#150;1798) of Stoke Bishop. Each of these made considerable fortunes in their different sections of the mercantile, banking, and brass trades, and they were linked by their Quakerism, kinship, and common interests. They built upon several generations of expertise and capital, which increased in parallel with the commercial and industrial revolutions. They handed on substantial fortunes to their children, who entered the landed gentry, and for the most part left industry and commerce behind.<br>
<br>The Harford businesses developed over several generations, and included the major brass-making company of the eighteenth century, mercantile activities, and banking interests which provided capital and credit for the second port of the kingdom. The family progressed from trade to industry, finance, and eventually gentrification. It was the chief among several interrelated Quaker families in Bristol who began as grocers or ironmongers and became wealthy business leaders, including the Champions, Goldneys, Andrews, Scandretts, Truemans, and Lloyds.<br>
