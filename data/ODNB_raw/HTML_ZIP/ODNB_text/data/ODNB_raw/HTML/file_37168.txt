<span class="headword">Beaumont,  Agnes</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1652, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">religious autobiographer</span>, was born in Edworth, Bedfordshire, where she was baptized Ann on 1 September 1652, the youngest of seven children (of whom three died in infancy) of John Beaumont, yeoman farmer of Edworth, and his wife, Mary Pakes of Pirton, Hertfordshire. Agnes was the author of a brief but vividly written autobiographical account describing events leading up to and following the death in 1674 of her father, whom she was accused of having poisoned with the help of the separatist minister John Bunyan, a crime for which, had she been convicted, she could have been burnt at the stake.<br>
<br>Her family was strongly nonconformist, and in 1672, having come under the spell of Bunyan's preaching, Agnes joined a congregation of his at Gamlingay. Her father had turned against Bunyan, however, and when he heard that she had ridden behind him to a meeting, he locked her out of the house for two days. When she promised not to attend any more meetings without his permission, they were reconciled, but he died the same night, probably of a heart attack, with only Agnes in the house. A former suitor, Mr Feery, the family lawyer, maliciously suggested that she had murdered him, and her brother had to summon from a neighbouring village a coroner and jury, which cleared her of any guilt. Rumours that she was carrying on an illicit relationship with Bunyan persisted for some time, and in the following year Feery also accused her of having set fire to a house in Edworth. Again these allegations were dismissed, but Bunyan was deeply disturbed by the continuing rumours of sexual misconduct, and added a section to a later edition of his own autobiography, <span class="italic">Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners</span> (1666), vehemently denying them.<br>
<br>In her middle life Beaumont was married twice: first, in 1702, to Thomas Warren of Cheshunt, a landowning gentleman who died in 1707 leaving her half his estate; then, in 1708, to Samuel Storey, a prosperous London fishmonger, who survived her. She died on 28 November 1720 and was buried at her own request near the minister John Wilson, in the yard of the Tilehouse Street Baptist meeting in Hitchin. She had contributed towards the cost of erecting the church building in 1692, and may have been a member before her marriage. Her autobiography remained in manuscript but copies began to circulate, and in 1760 it was published in a frequently reprinted collection of nonconformist conversion narratives. It is a rare example of the genre at this social level in the seventeenth century, and illustrates the power of radical religious belief to inspire resistance to patriarchal authority.<br>
