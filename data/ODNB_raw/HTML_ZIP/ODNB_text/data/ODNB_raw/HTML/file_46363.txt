<span class="headword">Busch,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1730&#150;1795), <span class="occ">nurseryman and landscape gardener</span>, was born at L&uuml;neburg, Hanover. Christened Johann, he later signed himself Johann Busch, John Busch, or John Bush. The family retained the spelling Busch. Although his early education and training are uncertain, it is likely that he studied gardening in Germany and Holland, probably working at George II's garden in Hanover, which would have provided the connection with England. He is said to have settled in London in 1744, though he would have been only about fourteen then and could hardly have had horticultural training in Germany and Holland.<br>
<br>Busch did, however, set up a nursery in Mare Street, Hackney, in 1756. This nursery&#151;later to achieve greater fame under another gardener from Hanover, Conrad Loddiges&#151;was particularly known for North American plants and trees obtained from John Bartram in Pennsylvania through Peter Collinson in London. Not only did this spur on those owners who wished to vary the planting in their new landscape gardens, but the nursery acted as a focal point for German owners eager to adopt the landscape style. Some came over to England in person, and others sent their gardeners. Sometimes a tour of English parks and gardens was involved, but the German gardeners also came to Busch for instruction. On the home front, the nursery supplied plants for such celebrated gardens as Kew. Busch groomed gardeners at his nursery for future appointments elsewhere, for example John Graefer, who went to work for the sixth earl of Coventry at Croome Court, Worcestershire, and afterwards became head gardener to the king of Naples. Lord Coventry was one of Busch's major customers. Married to Ann (<i>d</i>. 1785), he had at least three sons, who were employed as his assistants, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Busch's German connections may have led to his coming to the notice of Catherine the Great of Russia, herself of German origin. At Catherine's invitation, and with the offer of a large salary, he went to Russia in the summer of 1771, selling his Hackney nursery to Loddiges. He was scheduled to work at the palace of Kolomenskoe, near Moscow, but in the event seems to have switched to St Petersburg. He worked at the Oranienbaum Palace, whence he sent Lord Coventry a box of plants via Dr John Fothergill, who had replaced the now deceased Collinson as the principal agent in England for collecting seeds and plants. The contents included ferns, vacciniums, birch, aloe, lilies, rhododendrons, and geraniums. Busch was then commissioned to create a garden on a hill at Pulkovo, outside St Petersburg. Catherine paid a visit in 1774 and was delighted by a shaded gravel walk planted on both sides and a fine lawn bordered by gravel walks. Her enthusiasm led to Busch being given charge, together with the architect Vasily Neyelov, of the gardens at Tsarskoye Selo, the grandest of all his projects. Catherine conversed with him in German and the two clearly had a rapport.<br>
<br>Busch's role at Tsarskoye Selo covered landscape design, plantings, and the nurture of plants and fruit in a large number of hothouses. Melons, peaches, nectarines, watermelons, and oranges were cultivated, among others, and one hothouse was more than 250 metres in length. Busch and his family lived in part of the orangery. Thanks to his experience and care a variety of trees and shrubs was grown, which surprised visitors, given the difficulties of the climate. While more formal areas survived close to the palace, Busch and Neyelov (who had been to England) landscaped much of the park in a naturalistic style, with a central lake and many diverse architectural constructions, some of which were derived from English parks or pattern-books. Busch was head gardener from 1775 to 1789, and although it is difficult to determine exactly how much he actually designed, the hanging garden and the garden near the Cameron gallery were certainly his work.<br>
<br>In 1784 Busch's daughter Catherine married the architect Charles Cameron, who worked for the empress at Tsarskoye Selo and also at the great park at Pavlovsk, where he might possibly have been aided by Busch. For the park at Gatchina, Busch is thought to have provided the plan, which was implemented by the Scottish brothers John and Charles Sparrow. Woods, lakes, streams, bridges, and pavilions, linked by winding paths, provided a highly pictorial scene. Busch worked on Gatchina from 1779 to 1783, but the Sparrows had been there since 1769, so part of the park at least must have been their creation. Apart from his gardening duties Busch had to attend to some private requests from Catherine, such as dressing up as the innkeeper of a pretended tavern (really the bath pavilion in the park) for a visit by Count Falkenstein in 1780, who was used to travelling incognito and staying in taverns.<br>
<br>In 1789 Busch returned to Britain, and ended his days employed at Syon House rather sadly, being accused of neglecting the orange trees. He lived in Isleworth, Middlesex, and died in May 1795, being buried in the parish churchyard at Isleworth, adjacent to Syon, on 22 May. His house in Isleworth later became a school.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_46363"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Charles Busch</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1760, <em>d.</em> 1838), who was baptized at St John-at-Hackney, London, on 7 December 1760, followed his father as superintendent of Tsarskoye Selo gardens from 1789 to 1810. He drew a plan of the park as it was in 1789 rather than as a proposal. The gardens were extended and complemented by a late creation of Catherine, the Alexander Palace and park, intended for her favourite grandson, the future Alexander I. The palace was built in 1792&#150;6, and the park was laid out by Joseph Busch; considerable architectural embellishments were added during the nineteenth century. He landscaped the park at Yelagin island, a favourite summer haunt of St Petersburg citizens, from 1797, and was also responsible for the gardens of Alexander's palace on Kamenny island. At Yelagin he instigated a prodigious amount of earthmoving, even altering the size and shape of the island. A series of waterways and an embankment were constructed, and profuse tree-planting ensued, with groups arranged for form and colour. He designed the white metal railings round the palace garden and its flowering herbaceous borders. He also laid out the gardens at Babolovsky Palace for one of Catherine's favourites, Potemkin. Joseph Busch was dismissed from Tsarskoye Selo in 1810, for refusing to work to a reduced budget, but remained in St Petersburg. Twice married, he died in St Petersburg of cholera in 1838.<br>
<br>As they shared the same forename initial, Busch father and son are sometimes difficult to distinguish in contemporary sources, causing uncertainty as to which of them is meant. Their achievements were considerable. Between them they were responsible for the formation of some of the greatest parks around St Petersburg, a legacy that has lasted in good measure into the twenty-first century.<br>
