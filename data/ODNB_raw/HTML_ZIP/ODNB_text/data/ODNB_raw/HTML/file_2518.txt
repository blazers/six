<span class="headword">Blackburne, Sir  William</span>  (1764&#150;1839), <span class="occ">army and political officer in India</span>, was appointed to the Madras army as a cadet of native infantry in 1782, arrived at Madras in June 1783, and in 1784 served with the force employed under Colonel Fullarton in the campaign against the Poligars in Madura and Tinnevelly. He subsequently served in the campaign which ended in the defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1792. His proficiency as a linguist led to his being employed in 1787 as Maratha interpreter at Tanjore during the inquiry into the succession to the Tanjore raj, and he was for some years Maratha interpreter under the British resident at Tanjore. In 1801, having attained the rank of captain, he was appointed resident at the Tanjore court, and held that office until he left India in 1823.<br>
<br>Very shortly after his appointment as resident, Blackburne had to take the field at the head of his escort and of the raja's troops to repel two invasions of the province by insurgents from the adjoining districts. This he achieved with great skill, and the neighbouring province of Ramnad was recovered. In 1804 he exposed extensive frauds and oppression by the indigenous officials in Tanjore, the civil administration of which was under officials independent of the resident. He was employed subsequently by the Madras government to remodel the administration both in Tanjore and in the princely state of Pudukkottai, and was twice sent on special missions to Travancore. His political services gained the approval of Lord Wellesley and of successive governors of Madras, including Sir Thomas Munro. Blackburne, then a major-general, was knighted in 1838. He died at his house in Portland Place, London, on 16 October 1839, survived by his wife.<br>
