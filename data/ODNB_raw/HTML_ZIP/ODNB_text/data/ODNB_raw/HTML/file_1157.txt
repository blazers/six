<span class="headword">Balthere</span> <span class="st"> [St Balthere, Baldred, Balther]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 756), <span class="occ">hermit</span>, is often confused with an earlier saint of the same name. The later and better-known Balthere was described by his near contemporary Alcuin, in his poem on the bishops, kings, and saints of York. The so-called York annals, which underlie the chronicle of Symeon of Durham of the late eleventh century, give 756 as the date of Balthere's death (there spelt Balther). Alcuin regarded the solitaries Balthere and Echa as examples of the most complete monastic dedication to poverty, chastity, and solitude, as associated with Northumbrians like Cuthbert and Drythelm. One story has it that by his prayers Balthere moved the Bass Rock into the Firth of Forth; his temporary residence on the rock may be at the base of this tradition. The hermit died at Tyninghame (near North Berwick) and another legend claims that Tyninghame, Auldhame, and nearby Preston all claimed his body after death and that it was miraculously multiplied by three so that each church gained possession of it. This story, also recounted of other Celtic saints, was probably invented to explain how each church could claim his relics. A simple division seems a more likely explanation. During the late eleventh century Alfred Westow of Durham, a notorious relic collector, claimed to have found the bodies of Balthere and Billfrith, the goldsmith who decorated the binding of the Lindisfarne gospels, and brought them both back to Durham, where their feast was celebrated on 6 March.<br>
<br>Alcuin praised the hermit Balthere as &#145;a mighty warrior who vanquished time and again the hosts of the air that waged war on him in countless shapes&#146;. This language seems to echo the life of Antony by Athanasius and that of Guthlac by Felix. Alcuin also attributed to him the miracles of walking on water and of the deliverance from diabolical torments of a deacon who had touched a woman unchastely. Sparse as these details are, they represent esteem and respect on the part of one of the most articulate writers of his age.<br>
<br>Northumbrian saints such as Wilfrid, Bede, Cuthbert, and the hermit Balthere gained recognition through Alcuin. No such writer existed in the Glasgow area to record the life of <a name="cosubject_1251"></a><span class="headword">Baldred</span>  (<em>d.</em> 608?), <span class="occ">bishop</span>, who was a follower of St Kentigern, and later writers falsely attributed details of the life of the hermit Balthere to that of the bishop Baldred.<br>
