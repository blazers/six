<span class="headword">Tanner,  Frederick Arthur <span class="st"> [Robin]</span></span>  (1904&#150;1988), <span class="occ">etcher and educationist</span>, was born on 17 April 1904 at 5 Ryde Road, Knowle, Bristol, the third son of six children of Sydney Albert Tanner, journeyman carpenter, and Emily Annie, formerly Baker, a housemaid from Kington Langley, Wiltshire. On leaving Chippenham grammar school (1915&#150;21) Robin Tanner, as he was known, became a student primary school teacher at Ivy Lane School, Chippenham, and then moved to London to study teaching at Goldsmiths' College (1922&#150;4). Subsequently he taught at Blackheath Road Boys' School, Greenwich, London, attending evening classes in life drawing and etching at Goldsmiths' School of Art under Clive Gardiner and Stanley Anderson.<br>
<br>Inspired by exhibitions of work by F. L. Griggs and Samuel Palmer, Tanner produced his first etching, <span class="italic">A Tithe Barn</span>, in 1926, followed by <span class="italic">Alington in Wiltshire</span> (1927). Devoting himself to etching full time, he produced prints firmly rooted in the Wiltshire countryside, including <span class="italic">Martin's Hovel</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Christmas</span> (1929). That year he returned to teach at Ivy Lane School as the overseas market for English prints began to fail. However, despite being appointed an inspector of schools in 1935, necessitating a move to Leeds (1935&#150;7), this decade saw some of his most enduring images, including <span class="italic">Harvest Festival</span> (1930), <span class="italic">Autumn</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Wren and Primroses</span> (1935). In 1937 he was made an inspector of schools for Gloucestershire and subsequently for Oxfordshire (1956&#150;64). Owing to these commitments, <span class="italic">June</span> (1946) was the last print he was to do until he resumed etching in retirement and produced <span class="italic">Meadow Stile</span> (1970), the first of an abundant second flowering.<br>
<br>Elected an associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers in 1936, Tanner was made a senior fellow in 1973. He was also elected a member of the Royal West of England Academy in 1952. Of his work he wrote: &#145;My etched world is also an ideal world&#151;a world of pastoral beauty that could be ours if we did but desire it passionately enough&#146;  (Tanner, <span class="italic">Etcher's Craft</span>, 18).<br>
<br>On 4 April 1931 Tanner married his childhood sweetheart Heather Muriel Spackman (1903&#150;1993), a teacher, at Corsham church, Wiltshire. She was the second of three daughters of Herbert Spackman and Daisy Goold who owned grocery and drapery stores in Corsham. The Tanners enjoyed a long and happy marriage living in Old Chapel Field, the characterful home they built and made together in Kington Langley, Wiltshire. Designed in the style of Voysey, the house was largely furnished with pieces by many of the best contemporary craftspeople and surrounded by a burgeoning garden. The couple were childless but in 1938 they gave asylum to Dietrich Anselm Hanff (1920&#150;1992), a Jewish boy fleeing Nazi Germany; he lived with them for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Robin and Heather shared many interests and were always generous hosts to their numerous friends. Both were committed Quakers and pacifists and staunch supporters of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Their love and understanding of the English countryside, its customs and traditions, is reflected in their joint publications such as <span class="italic">Wiltshire Village</span> (1939), <span class="italic">A Country Alphabet</span> (1984), and <span class="italic">A Country Book of Days</span> (1986). <span class="italic">Woodland Plants</span> (1981) reveals both the depth of their botanical knowledge and their strong preoccupation with ecology and conservation. Another joint concern was to establish the Crafts Study Centre in 1970, and, together with friends and colleagues, they succeeded in creating a unique collection and archive of leading British craftspeople of the twentieth century. It first opened to the public within the Holburne of Menstrie Museum, Bath, in 1977 and subsequently moved to the Surrey Institute of Art and Design, University College, Farnham, in 2000. In 1987 Robin Tanner's autobiography was published. The following year he died at Old Chapel Field, on 19 May 1988, and was cremated five days later at Haycombe cemetery and crematorium, Bath. Sets of his etchings may be seen at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
