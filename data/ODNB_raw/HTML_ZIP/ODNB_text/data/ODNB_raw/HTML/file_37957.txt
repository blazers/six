<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Siddal,  Elizabeth Eleanor</span>  (1829&#150;1862), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 7 Charles Street, Hatton Gardens, Holborn, London, on 25 July 1829, the third of eight children of Charles Siddall (<i>d</i>. 1859), ironmonger, and his wife, Elizabeth Eleanor Evans (<i>d</i>. 1892). Of respectable working-class background with some pretensions to gentility, without formal education, she nevertheless possessed an instinctive refinement of manner. Her deportment, said to be &#145;like a queen&#146;, was perhaps formed by her work at the dressmaking and millinery shop in Cranborne Alley, Leicester Square, to which she journeyed from Southwark, where her family was living. In 1850 she was noticed by the artist Walter Deverell, who asked her to act as a model for him and a group of young friends who were beginning to distinguish themselves as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. She agreed, and sat for Deverell, William Holman Hunt, and for John Everett Millais as the drowned Ophelia. Within a short time she was sitting only for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24140/', "Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828&#150;1882)")</script>.<br>
<br>Siddal's features are apparent in nearly all Rossetti's work until her death, most notably in <span class="italic">Beata Beatrix</span> (<i>c</i>.1860&#150;64; Tate), <span class="italic">Regina cordium</span> (1860; Johannesburg Art Gallery), <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span> (1857&#150;8; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University), and <span class="italic">Writing on the Sand</span> (1859; British Museum). By pen and pencil he conveyed in his innumerable studies of this quite ordinary girl, the fragility of an idealized beauty, and the paths of ill health, for in an enfeebled frame she seemed to carry the seeds of consumption. These studies, rare in quality, present a unique series; Sir John Ward considered that there was nothing comparable in European art. The pathos of her strange beauty is recorded in heavy lids drooping over agate-coloured eyes, wings of copper-red hair framing a face singular in its remoteness. Languor informed every portrayal, whether sleeping, reading, or (rarely) standing. In these representations &#145;stamped with immortality&#146;, she seemed to Ford Madox Brown &#145;thinner &amp; more deathlike &amp; more beautiful &amp; more ragged than ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Ford Madox Brown</span>, ed. V. Surtees, 1981, 101). Guggum or the Sid were her pet names; the final &#145;l&#146; in her surname was discarded to please Rossetti.<br>
<br>Rossetti fostered Siddal's slight talent for drawing, largely derivative from his own work, and saw genius in her strangely haunting imagery. She worked hard and for a short time attended an art school at Sheffield. Her early drawings, <span class="italic">Pippa Passes</span> and <span class="italic">Lovers Listening to Music</span> (both 1854; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), show some technical proficiency, while the slightly later watercolours executed as her strength diminished are those of an amateur. The figures are awkwardly flattened, without any semblance of life, and are dependent on the emotional context of the subject. These&#151;taken from medieval lore, border ballads, and from works by Keats, Browning, and Tennyson&#151;are placed within tightly enclosed spaces and illustrated by strangely remote figures largely imbued with her own melancholic nature. Examples include <span class="italic">Sir Patrick Spens</span> (1856; Tate collection), <span class="italic">St Agnes Eve</span> (<i>c</i>.1856; Wightwick Manor, Wolverhampton), and <span class="italic">Clerk Saunders</span> (1857; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). Her <span class="italic">Self-Portrait</span> (1853&#150;4) is in private hands, as too are <span class="italic">Lady Clare</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">The Quest of the Holy Grail</span> (1855). Some of her designs were included in the 1857 Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in Russell Square. John Ruskin praised her watercolours and wished to settle money on her in exchange for any work her health permitted.<br>
<br>Siddal also wrote verse of a disillusioned and morbid character, echoing her own sense of neglect, for the passionate love of the early years had turned to disenchantment. With sadly impaired health and frustrated by Rossetti's reluctance to commit himself to marriage, and his too apt inclination to infidelity, she resorted to ever-increasing doses of laudanum. Finally, on 23 May 1860 Rossetti married her at St Clement's Church, Hastings; a year later a child was stillborn. Elizabeth Siddal committed suicide on 11 February 1862 with an overdose of laudanum, in their rooms at 14 Chatham Place, Blackfriars. She was buried on 17 February with other members of the Rossetti family in Highgate cemetery. Rossetti's complex feelings of remorse and guilt for the discords and disillusions of their life together fluctuated with the years though the haunting recollection of his wife was translated into a few lines, scribbled in his notebook:<blockquote>
<div>As much as in a hundred years, she's dead:<br>
</div>
<div>Yet is to-day the day on which she died.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Collected Works of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</span>, ed. W. M. Rossetti, 1886, 1.380)</blockquote>In October 1869 Siddal's coffin was opened by her husband's wish and a book of his poems, laid beside her at death, was removed. These he published in <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1870).<br>
