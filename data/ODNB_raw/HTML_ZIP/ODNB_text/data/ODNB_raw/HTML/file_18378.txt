<span class="headword">Maundrell,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1665, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and traveller in the Middle East</span>, was the son of Robert Maundrell of Compton Bassett, near Calne, Wiltshire, where he was baptized on 23 December 1665. In the register of Exeter College, Oxford, his father is described as &#145;pleb&#146;, but the family had previously been important locally. He matriculated on 4 April 1682, at the age of sixteen, and entered Exeter College, Oxford, as commoner on 27 September. He graduated BA on 15 October 1685 and MA on 19 June 1688. He was elected Sarum fellow at Exeter College on 30 June 1686 and became a full fellow of the college on 28 June 1697, the day on which he also graduated BD by decree.<br>
<br>Maundrell was appointed curate of Bromley, Kent, in 1689, where he remained until 1695. A tombstone in Richmond churchyard suggests that he had also been a curate there. On 15 December 1695 he preached a sermon to a body of the Levant Company's merchants at the church of St Peter-le-Poer in London (published in 1696), and on 20 December he was elected by their general court as chaplain to the Levant Company's factory at Aleppo in Turkey. The chaplains to the Levant Company's factories were often distinguished scholars, interested in holy places and in classical sites and civilizations. Their pay was normally 400 dollars (about &pound;100) per annum, plus travel to the Levant and additional payment towards equipment, including books. Maundrell was granted &pound;20 on 15 January 1696 for books for its library. His reasons for taking up this new appointment are not entirely clear, and there is indication that he did so with some reluctance. He seems to have had a romantic involvement in England from which he was reluctant to allow his mentors, notably his uncle Sir Charles Hedges, to extricate him by encouragement to the Aleppo post.<br>
<br>Maundrell arrived in Aleppo in 1696, having travelled via Frankfurt am Main to discuss aspects of the history and topography of the Holy Land with the German scholar and orientalist Job Ludolphus (Hiob Leiutholf). His daily work included the saying of the Anglican office for the factors in Aleppo. He stated in a letter to the bishop of Rochester, published as a preface to his <span class="italic">Journey</span>, that &#145;it is our first employment every morning to solemnize the daily Service of the Church; at which I am sure to have always a devout, a regular and full Congregation&#146;. While in Aleppo he suffered from ill health, and he died there of fever early in 1701. The vacancy caused by his death is recorded in the Levant Company's minutes on 15 May 1701.<br>
<br>Maundrell is best-known for his account <span class="italic">A Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem at Easter A.D. 1697</span>, published in Oxford in 1703, two years after his death. This scholarly narrative describes in detail the journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem and back, made by Maundrell and fourteen others in 1697. His motive was to undertake an Easter pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and the company departed at 3 p.m. on Friday, 26 February 1697. Their route took them across northern Syria to Latakia, down the coast to Acre, then to Jerusalem for the Latin Easter, then inland to the valley of the Jordan and Bethlehem, returning to Jerusalem for the Eastern churches' Easter. They returned to Aleppo via Damascus, Tripoli, and the earlier part of their outward route, returning to Aleppo on 18 May.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Journey</span> was partially intended to bring up to date George Sandys's account of 1610, <span class="italic">Relation of a journey begun an. dom. 1610. Foure bookes. Containing a description of the Turkish empire, of Aegypt, of the Holy Land, of the remote parts of Italy and llands adioyning</span>. In fact, Maundrell's account is quite different from that of Sandys, and is a major work in its own right, giving detailed descriptions of the life and landscapes of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine, including the agricultural practices of the regions and places encountered, in addition to descriptions of places of religious significance. The factual accounts of the relict features of the ancient worlds are of interest and value, and they are accompanied by careful measurements and plans of major sites such as Baalbek. Maundrell is critical of much of what he and his companions saw and experienced, but his accounts are well informed from contemporary and much earlier, classical and biblical sources, and written in an economic but witty and informative style. Later writers valued this work. Curzon, in his <span class="italic">Visits to Monasteries in the Levant</span> (1849), says that he &#145;was struck with the superiority of old Maundrell's narrative over all the others, for he tells us plainly and clearly what he saw&#146;  (Curzon, 168), and Howell, in a preface to a 1963 reprint of the <span class="italic">Journey</span>, says that &#145;it is taut, disciplined writing from which every wrinkle of ambiguity has been ironed away&#146;  (Howell, xi). Most of the nineteenth-century writers on the Holy Land, including Henry Robinson, Dean Stanley, Carl Ritter, and George Adam Smith, comment positively on Maundrell's account.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem</span> went through twelve editions by 1810 and it appeared in full and condensed form in later compendia of travels in the Levant and the Holy Land, including Thomas Wright's edited <span class="italic">Early Travels in Palestine</span> (1848). It was translated into French in 1705 and 1706, into Dutch in 1717, and into German in 1737, and remains an important account of the places and peoples of the region.<br>
