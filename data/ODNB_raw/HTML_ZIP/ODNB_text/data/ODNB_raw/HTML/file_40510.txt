<span class="headword">Murray,  George</span>  (1741&#150;1797), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 22 August 1741 at Tullibardine, Perthshire, the fourth son and fifth of the seven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19605/', "Lord George Murray (1694&#150;1760)")</script>, Jacobite army officer, and Amelia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Murray (1710&#150;1766). His paternal grandfather was John Murray, first duke of Atholl, and his maternal grandfather was James Murray of Glencarse and Strowan. His father and his father's older brother, the marquess of Tullibardine, supported the Jacobite risings in 1715, 1719, and 1745&#150;6. Lord George Murray, who served as a lieutenant-general under Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, fled to the continent after the Jacobite defeat at Culloden. Young George Murray remained in Scotland and never saw his father after 1746. From 1755 to 1756 he attended the school of William Rose at Kew, and then he entered the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth where he remained until 1758.<br>
<br>Murray began his naval career in 1758 as a midshipman on the ship of the line <i>Newark</i> (80 guns), flagship of Vice-Admiral Francis Holburne, a fellow Scot. After a cruise in the channel, he went in 1759 to India in the <i>Falmouth</i> (50 guns). He returned to England in 1762 in the frigate <i>Terpsichore</i>, passed his lieutenant's examination, and was appointed to the sloop <i>Swift</i>. In 1763 he was moved to the frigate <i>Tartar</i> which the next year joined the squadron at Jamaica where he was promoted commander of the sloop <i>Ferret</i> in 1765. While serving on the Jamaica station he surveyed Mobile harbour in British West Florida and collected for his brother, the third duke of Atholl, specimens of flora and fauna and Native American artefacts from that region to form a valuable collection at Blair Castle in Scotland. Posted as captain of the frigate <i>Renown</i> in 1768, he transferred to another frigate, the <i>Adventure</i>, and returned to England in 1769. From 1770 to 1775 he was on half pay and then he was appointed to the frigate <i>Levant</i> in the Mediterranean where he served until 1779. Having next been appointed to the frigate <i>Cleopatra</i> in 1780, he served in the downs, the channel, and the North Sea where he participated in the battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781. In December 1782 he was appointed to his first ship of the line command, the <i>Irresistible</i> (74 guns), which was paid off at the end of the American War of Independence.<br>
<br>While on half pay (1783&#150;90) Murray retired to Perthshire. On 13 May 1784 he married Wilhelmina King (<i>c</i>.1738&#150;1795), daughter of Thomas, fifth Baron King of Ockham, and established his residence at Stanley House, Strathord. They had no children. In 1790 Murray purchased the estate of Pitkeathly near Bridge of Earn in Perthshire. At the general election of 1790 Murray, with the approval of Henry Dundas, political manager in Scotland for William Pitt, was elected member of parliament for the Perth burghs on the interest of his nephew, the fourth duke of Atholl. In parliament he gave silent support to the Pitt government and willingly vacated his seat in March 1796 for a friend of Dundas.<br>
<br>Murray resumed his naval career in August 1790 at the time of the Nootka crisis with Spain when he was appointed to the <i>Defence</i> (74 guns). The dispute, however, was soon resolved, and the <i>Defence</i> was paid off in November. In September 1792 Murray was appointed to the <i>Vengeance</i> (74 guns) and made commander-in-chief in the Medway at Chatham with the temporary rank of commodore. On outbreak of war with France in February 1793, Murray was given command of the <i>Duke</i> (98 guns) and made a colonel of the Royal Marines. In March he sailed for the West Indies in the fleet of Admiral Alan Gardner. While off Martinique in June the <i>Duke</i> was severely damaged by lightning, and Murray returned to England with a convoy in October. He was then transferred at Plymouth to another ship of the line, the <i>Glory</i> (98 guns).<br>
<br>Murray was made commander-in-chief of the North American squadron based on Halifax, Nova Scotia, in March 1794, and was promoted rear-admiral in April and vice-admiral the next year. Murray's squadron&#151;consisting of his flagship, the <i>Resolution</i> (74 guns), two other ships of the line, four frigates, and a sloop&#151;sailed from England in May and reached Halifax in August after touching at the Delaware and Sandy Hook. Although the North American station was not a major theatre, important British interests, such as the colonies in North America, trade, and the fisheries required naval protection. With a cruising area extending from the Gulf of St Lawrence and the Bay of Fundy southwards to the Bahamas and eastwards from the coast of the United States to Bermuda, Murray's inadequate force, always short of seamen and including small vessels, operated under adverse conditions. An additional burden were the frequent confrontations with the United States over neutral rights and obligations.<br>
<br>For more than two years Murray, a seasoned and experienced officer, conducted his command with vigilance, restraint, and tact. His squadron almost completely cleared North American waters of French men-of-war and privateers. He won the praise of the mercantile and shipping interests of British North America for providing adequate and timely convoys, especially for the critical cargoes of masts and naval stores bound for England. Seeing the need for an auxiliary operating base farther south than Halifax in order to expedite cruising during the winter months and to lessen the need to use the territorial waters of the United States, Murray persuaded the Admiralty to add Bermuda to his command. He authorized the survey of the anchorage at Bermuda, which would later be known as Murray's anchorage, and ordered the building of storehouses and water tanks for supplying the squadron and the establishment of a naval hospital. When Murray became aware of the availability of cedar timber and shipbuilders in the islands he initiated the building at Bermuda of sloops and smaller vessels that were critically needed by his squadron and the British navy elsewhere.<br>
<br>At the beginning of Murray's third year in the North American command, Earl Spencer, first lord of the Admiralty, recommended that he should remain on the station and not be recalled when his three-year tour of overseas duty ended. Spencer emphasized that Murray, well known and liked in America, was familiar with the peculiar difficulties of the station where he had served with distinction. Murray, however, suffered a stroke in May 1796; this was followed by a more severe attack in October which forced him to relinquish the command. His departure from America elicited warm expressions of appreciation, public and private, especially in Bermuda and Nova Scotia, for his defence of the colonies and the protection of trade. He also received testimonials of affection and professional commendation from his subordinates in the squadron. After returning to England Murray died on 17 October 1797 at the home of his nephew, Lord George Murray, at Hunton in Kent. He was buried at Ockham in Surrey near his wife, who had died on 28 December 1795. A memorial tablet to his memory was erected in the parish church of All Saints at Ockham.<br>
<br>Although he was held in high esteem by his superiors, both civilian and naval, and by his fellow officers and subordinates, Murray has not received the recognition he deserves. Despite his success as commander-in-chief in North America Murray's career as a flag officer was comparatively brief and entirely confined to an overseas station far distant from the scenes of major actions. Moreover his career has been sometimes confused with that of a younger admiral of the same name, Sir George Murray (1755&#150;1819).<br>
