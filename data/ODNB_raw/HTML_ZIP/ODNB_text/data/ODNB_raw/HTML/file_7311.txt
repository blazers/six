<span class="headword">Davy,  Edmund</span>  (1785&#150;1857), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at Penzance, the second son of William Davy and his wife, M[ary?] Ann. He obtained his early education in Penzance, where he stayed until moving to London in 1804. With the help of his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7314/', "Humphry Davy")</script>, professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution, he was appointed operator and assistant in the laboratory of the institution in 1807. He was also made responsible for the mineralogical collection in addition to his duties of keeping the laboratory in order. Gaining valuable experience, he held the post until 1813 when, through Humphry Davy's influence, he moved to Ireland, becoming professor of chemistry and secretary at the Royal Cork Institution, founded in 1802, an organization modelled on the Royal Institution. There he obtained a good reputation as a lecturer and research worker.<br>
<br>In 1826 Davy succeeded William Higgins as professor of chemistry at the Royal Dublin Society, where he established a school of practical chemistry and arranged popular courses of lectures in Dublin and in other parts of the country. The lectures were wide-ranging in scope and included agricultural and vegetable chemistry, evening courses on chemistry and, from 1850, lectures on the chemistry of colour pigments. Davy was an excellent teacher and students appreciated the courses, which were well attended. In 1856 he became professor of agricultural chemistry at the Royal Dublin Society, shortly before his retirement from a career spent in teaching, the promotion of scientific education and knowledge, and a great deal of useful, but purely empirical, research.<br>
<br>While at the Royal Institution, Davy published several studies of platinum and its salts. Humphry Davy's research on the miner's safety lamp revealed that a pre-heated platinum wire continued to glow when held in an inflammable gaseous mixture. This puzzling phenomenon was investigated by Edmund Davy in Dublin. In 1820 he described a finely divided platinum (&#145;platinum black&#146;) produced by reducing a solution of platinum sulphate with alcohol. Although he noted its surprising ability to oxidize alcohol at room temperature, Davy failed to grasp the significance of his discovery and it was left to others such as J. W. D&ouml;bereiner to exploit the catalytic powers of platinum and other finely divided metals. In 1836 Davy made another important discovery. By the action of water on potassium carbide he obtained an inflammable gas he identified as &#145;a new bicarburet of hydrogen&#146;. In 1860 it was rediscovered and thoroughly investigated by M. Berthelot, who named it acetylene.<br>
<br>Davy's other researches covered a wide range of subjects. Besides platinum his metallurgical topics included fulminating silver, the detection of metallic poisons using electrochemistry, and tests for manganese. Other publications of agricultural or horticultural interest dealt with the improvement of wheat flour and the detection and prevention of fraud in the sale of skimmed milk, for which Davy designed a lactometer. He also analysed soils and manures. Much of Davy's work at the Royal Dublin Society entailed investigating and solving problems such as the study of bog butter (a tallow-like substance from peat bogs); the state of the Irish soap industry; the use of chloride of lime for fumigation; the comparison of Irish and Virginian tobacco; and a solution to the problem of iron corrosion at D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour. He also published details of experiments on the relative deodorizing powers of peat charcoal, peat, and lime.<br>
<br>Barker's memoir describes Davy as having &#145;a warm heart and affectionate disposition, ever ready to advise or encourage, tolerant of ignorance, humble even to his inferiors&#146;  (Barker, 424). His marriage to Phillis Emma Barry, only daughter of David Barry of Dundulrick, co. Cork, resulted in a family of several children. Their eldest son, Edmund William (1826&#150;<i>c</i>.1900), who assisted his father at the Royal Dublin Society, eventually succeeded him there as professor.<br>
<br>Davy was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1826 and was an original member of the Chemical Society of London. He also became a member of the Royal Irish Academy and honorary member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise Statistique Universelle. In the last year of his life he suffered ill health, and died on 5 November 1857 at his home, Kimmage Lodge, Kimmage, Dublin. He was probably buried in St Mary's churchyard, Crumlin.<br>
