<span class="headword">Nash,  Vaughan Robinson</span>  (1861&#150;1932), <span class="occ">journalist and public servant</span>, was born on 5 October 1861 at 7 Buckingham Villas, Clifton, Bristol, the son of Charles Nash (<i>d</i>. 1901), a timber merchant, and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson. Privately educated, he was not sent to university, though he became a resident for two years (1887&#150;9) in Toynbee Hall, the university settlement in the East End of London. In collaboration with his fellow resident Hubert Llewellyn Smith he wrote <span class="italic">The Story of the Dockers' Strike</span> (1889), an account of the celebrated strike in which Cardinal Manning intervened. He also composed <span class="italic">The Relation of Cooperative to Competitive Trading</span> (1887). This settlement experience led him to specialize in writing about organized labour. He married, on 29 June 1892, <a href="#cosubject_58468">Rosalind Frances Mary Shore Smith [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who was also a journalist with an interest in labour issues, and with whom he had three children. From 1893 to 1899 he was on the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span>. Like his colleague on that newspaper H. J. Massingham he appears to have been dismissed from his post because of his support for the Boers in South Africa. In 1900 he was a correspondent for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, which published his regular reports from India. An edited collection of these reports was published as <span class="italic">The Great Famine and its Causes</span> (1900). In 1901 he joined the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. He was among the members of the New Reform Club who in 1903 helped to persuade the Liberal Party chief whip to leave openings for the election of Labour parliamentary candidates.<br>
<br>In December 1905 Nash was brought into 10 Downing Street by the new prime minister, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, as an assistant private secretary under Arthur Ponsonby. As the more experienced of the two secretaries to the prime minister, with a background in journalism, Nash advised on policy and public questions, but &#145;his incurable modesty and self-effacement&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Dec 1932) made him diffident among the social trappings of high office. H. H. Asquith retained his services on succeeding Campbell-Bannerman on 5 April 1908, and promoted him to be the principal private secretary in December 1908. Nash was therefore at the centre of government during the general election of 1906, which gave the Liberals a large majority in the House of Commons, and during the elections and controversies about the future of the House of Lords in 1910. Many of his surviving letters were written on behalf of the prime minister, including those sent to the king's private secretary. He was succeeded in 1912 as the principal private secretary by his wife Rosalind's second cousin, Maurice Bonham-Carter (1880&#150;1960), an assistant private secretary since 1910.<br>
<br>In 1912 Asquith appointed Nash to be an unpaid commissioner and then in 1913 the second vice-chairman of the Development Commission, a post carrying the salary of &pound;1000 a year as that body's principal official. The commission, a product of Lloyd George's budget of 1909, and comprising eight unpaid commissioners under the chairmanship of Lord Richard Cavendish, was designed to make recommendations for Treasury grants that would assist rural industries and help voluntary bodies providing services to the countryside. It also promoted harbours, forestry, and fisheries.<br>
<br>In August 1915 Asquith brought Nash back into 10 Downing Street to help with the extra burdens of managing the war effort. Valued for his tact and hard work, Nash played an important role in helping Asquith to keep Liberal ministers within the coalition government during the conscription crisis at the end of 1915. In March 1916 Nash was appointed to the secretariat of the reconstruction committee of the cabinet, which was regarded as writing the &#145;peace book&#146;, preparing for demobilization and the end of war. The team of civil servants and other advisers gathered around Nash, which included several member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96279', "Romney Street group")</script>, was kept in being when Lloyd George became the prime minister of a coalition government on 6 December 1916. It formed the embryo of the staff of the Ministry of Reconstruction under Christopher Addison that was formed by Lloyd George on 17 July 1917.<br>
<br>Nash returned to the vice-chairmanship of the Development Commission in January 1919, when Addison was moved by the prime minister. During the next ten years (1919&#150;29), as vice-chairman, Nash was highly regarded for the contributions he made to the improvement of the English village. In 1915&#150;16 he had been a member of the government committee that had prepared the scheme to settle demobilized soldiers on the land. Like another member of the Romney Street group, Clough Williams-Ellis, he was close to those who wished to preserve the rural landscape. Although for much of his working life he lived in Hampstead, he always kept a foothold in the countryside. Around 1900 he brought up his family in a house at Headley, near Box Hill in Surrey. He owned a farm at Froxfield, near Petersfield in Hampshire, and a house in Loughton, Essex. In 1929, on retirement from the vice-chairmanship but remaining an unpaid commissioner, he decided to move to the New Forest in Hampshire. He became a man of influence in rural affairs by pointing the Development Commission in the direction of providing facilities for villages, such as village halls, in collaboration with national and local voluntary bodies. The scheme sponsored by the National Council of Social Service to promote rural community councils received initial funding from the Carnegie UK Trust. Nash was instrumental in establishing the Country Industries Ltd and the Rural Industries Bureau, and in getting voluntary bodies to work together. The article he published in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (&#145;The awakened village&#146;, 28 Sept 1932) shortly before his death summarized some of his achievements, including the creation of twenty rural community councils. In later life he gave the impression of being a philanthropist who used public funds, because as the vice-chairman of the Development Commission he controlled its recommendations to the Treasury for grants made to non-profitmaking organizations.<br>
<br>Nash died of bronchopneumonia on 16 December 1932 at Langtree House, Wood Green, near Fordingbridge, Hampshire, and was buried on 19 December in the churchyard of St Margaret's, East Wellow, Hampshire, where he had been married forty years earlier. After he died his former colleagues set up a memorial fund to help the advancement of village crafts and industries. His wife and a son survived him: his other two children had died in accidents, a daughter in 1920 and a son in 1923. Drawn into journalism through his concern for the poor and into public service through the patronage of three successive prime ministers, Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, and Lloyd George, Nash was regarded by Sir Alfred Zimmern as &#145;the embodiment of post-laissez-faire Liberalism at its best&#146;  (Johnson, 23&#150;4). But Beatrice Webb saw him as &#145;woolly minded, easily frightened off any decisive step&#146; and surrounded by &#145;a set of dreamy cultivated amateurs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Beatrice Webb</span>, 3.279&#150;80).<br>
<br>Nash's wife <a name="cosubject_58468"></a><span class="headword">Rosalind Frances Mary Nash</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Rosalind Frances Mary  Shore Smith]</span>  (1862&#150;1952) was born in Kensington, London, in December 1862, the elder daughter of William Shore Smith (1831&#150;1894), landowner, of Embley Park, Hampshire, and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire, and his wife, Louisa Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Samuel Hutchins of Ardnagashel, co. Cork. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48682/', "Barbara Stephen")</script> was her younger sister. Her father took the name Shore Nightingale as the nephew and heir of William Edward Shore, later Nightingale (1794&#150;1874), father of Florence Nightingale, by the entail placed on the Nightingale family estate. As an adolescent she moved with her family into the country house which her great-uncle had purchased in 1825 and where her great-aunt had entertained many distinguished guests from Unitarian, Quaker, and evangelical Anglican circles. Educated at Heath Brow School, Hampstead, and Girton College, Cambridge (1881&#150;4), she became a <span class="occ">journalist</span>, writing on suffrage and labour questions, and was active in the Women's Co-operative Guild. In 1918 she was co-opted onto the select committee examining the imposition of taxes on luxury goods. In her early life she had frequently met her father's cousin, Florence Nightingale, and later she assisted Sir Edward Cook with his biography of Nightingale, publishing her own abridged version of that work. She guarded the memorabilia of Florence Nightingale, and assisted in setting up an exhibition at St Thomas's Hospital in July 1937, when she also gave a radio broadcast of her reminiscences, defending the memory of her second cousin against the portrait depicted by Lytton Strachey. She died on 17 October 1952 at The Cleve, Wood Green, Fordingbridge, Hampshire.<br>
