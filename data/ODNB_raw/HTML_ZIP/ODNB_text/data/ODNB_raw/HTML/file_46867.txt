<span class="headword">Ferranti,  Sebastian Ziani  de</span>  (1864&#150;1930), <span class="occ">electrical engineer and inventor</span>, was born on 9 April 1864 at Havelock Buildings, Liverpool, the only son of Cesar Ziani de Ferranti (1831&#150;1903), photographer, and his wife, Juliana, a talented concert pianist and daughter of the portrait painter William Scott. His mother had formerly been married to a Polish guitarist and revolutionary, Stanislas Szczepanowski, with whom she had three daughters and two sons, and his father's family traced its Ziani lineage back to eighth-century Italy and included in its ancestry two doges of Venice (Sebastiano Ziani in 1173 and Pietro Ziani in 1205). By the nineteenth century Marco Aurelio Ziani, who in his later years added &#145;de Ferranti&#146; to his name as a result of an inheritance, had developed an extensive reputation as an innovative guitarist, and after several world tours eventually settled in Belgium as guitarist to L&eacute;opold I. It was there that his son Cesar developed an interest in the new science of photography, and after marrying Juliana Szczepanowski, he decided to establish a partnership in Liverpool with his father-in-law, William Scott. This photographic portraiture business flourished, and their son, Sebastian, was born into a comfortable household.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>During his formative years Sebastian seemed to follow in his family's footsteps by showing an interest in art, and by the time he had been sent to St Stanislas preparatory school, Hampstead in 1874 he was already an accomplished artist. While at preparatory school, encouraged by extensive conversations with his half-brother, Vincent Szczepanowski, a maritime engineer, he started experimenting with steam engines. This mechanical bent developed further when in 1877 he was sent to St Augustine's, Ramsgate, Kent, a Benedictine boarding-school, where the staff encouraged his experiments and introduced him to the emerging science of electric lighting. Apart from reading extensively, including Ganot's <span class="italic">Elementary Treatise on Physics</span>, he fixed up an electric bell for the school, and by January 1879 was informing his parents that he wanted to be a &#145;Manufacturing Engineer&#146;. In September 1880 his father therefore paid for him to go to University College, London, where he enrolled for an engineering degree, but in February 1881 Cesar suffered a serious cerebral thrombosis, which plunged the family into major financial difficulties. This crisis marked a watershed in Sebastian's life; he was suddenly wrenched from a relatively comfortable life and obliged to help support his family.<br>
<br>It would actually have been no great sacrifice for Ferranti to abandon his academic studies, because he had little interest in this kind of work, preferring to develop his own ideas through practical experiments. This ability secured him his first job, as a research engineer at the leading electrical engineering firm of Siemens, where he came into contact with the eminent inventor Alexander Siemens. The experience proved invaluable, especially as it allowed him the opportunity to perfect his ideas on the design of alternator armatures. He was actually in the process of developing a novel form of armature at the time that he met Alfred Thompson, a photographer who was also a family friend; and as a result of having interested a solicitor, Francis Ince, in his ideas, the electrical engineering firm of Ferranti, Thompson, and Ince Ltd had been formed by September 1882.<h2>
<a name="Ferrantiandelectricity"></a>Ferranti and electricity</h2>Although this new firm survived for only one year&#151;largely because of the severe slump in electric-lighting activity arising from the dubious activities of promoters and engineers during the &#145;Brush Bubble&#146; in summer 1882&#151;it established the Ferranti name as a significant part of the embryonic industry. In fact, the armature design produced by Ferranti had inadvertently infringed elements of a patent recently taken out by the distinguished scientist Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), but after agreeing to pay Thomson &pound;500 a year the firm gained access to a reliable source of technical expertise. Ferranti also worked closely with Robert Hammond, one of the industry's leading entrepreneurs, but although they operated a joint venture between 1883 and 1885, this was no more successful than the first firm. It was only when, in the summer of 1885, Ferranti created a partnership with Francis Ince (based at Hatton Garden, London), that he was able to secure greater continuity in his business activities; but the series of events leading up to this momentous deal illustrates how this dark, handsome young man with flashing bright eyes and excited oratory could instil confidence in others. In 1888 he married Gertrude Ruth Ince (1869&#150;1959), his partner's daughter. They raised a large family, one of whom was <a href="#cosubject_46867">(Gerard) Vincent Sebastian de Ferranti [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>The infectious enthusiasm for electricity with which Ferranti impressed those around him had certainly been a positive asset up to 1885, but during the next six years it was to be even more important as he launched a series of schemes which would establish his worldwide reputation as a leading advocate of high-tension alternating-current (AC) generation and distribution. It was as a result of selling some of his revolutionary mercury-motor electricity meters to Sir Coutts Lindsay &amp; Co. that Ferranti was to be given the chance to put these ideas into practice, as Coutts Lindsay had ambitious plans to light up London's West End. The firm had first started as a means of lighting Sir Coutts Lindsay's Grosvenor Gallery, but as a result of increased demand from neighbours an extensive system was installed, and advice was given from another member of the Lindsay family, the well-known scientist the earl of Crawford. After the first design failed to work effectively Ferranti was brought in to overhaul the station and distributing system. Experience at the Grosvenor Gallery demonstrated the practical feasibility of Ferranti's ideas, and by 1887 the London Electricity Supply Corporation (LESCo.) had been created by Lindsay and his brother, Lord Wantage. This venture, designed entirely by Ferranti, was based on an ambitious plan to light two million lamps, using the world's largest generators installed in a much larger station at Deptford. From there, the unprecedented distribution pressure of 10,000 volts would be sent along cables and transformers&#151;a design which challenged contemporary electric current engineering expertise.<h2>
<a name="Ferrantisexpansionandoverexpansion"></a>Ferranti's expansion and over-expansion</h2>Although LESCo. was a commercial failure, and Ferranti struggled until the summer of 1891 to overcome the engineering difficulties, Deptford was regarded by many as the pioneer of modern electricity-supply systems: it was built where land was cheap, water was accessible, and coal could be transported economically to a station generating at high voltages along an extensive distribution system using step-up and step-down transformers. Contemporaries marvelled at the 10,000 hp generators. The mains and transformers designed to carry and distribute the 10,000 volts established the Ferranti name as the leader in its field. Unfortunately, though, when LESCo. finally dispensed with Ferranti's services in 1891, no other British customers for this kind of equipment could be found, and as a result the private limited liability company formed in 1890, S. Z. de Ferranti Ltd, with expanded premises at 57B Charterhouse Square, London, struggled for several years. It was only when demand for generating and distribution equipment increased during the mid-1890s that the firm recovered from the shock of losing the LESCo. contract, but thereafter expansion seemed assured as electric lighting and power grew in popularity. Ferranti had also been able to sell his high-pressure cable patents to the British Insulated Wire Company, providing useful collateral against the bank loans on which the firm relied. S. Z. de Ferranti Ltd was so inundated with orders that by 1896 Ferranti decided to move out of London and rent larger premises in Hollinwood, near Oldham, Lancashire, where for the next seventy years his enterprise flourished.<br>
<br>Two major businesses at Hollinwood were initially set up&#151;one for production of meters, for which Ferranti had an extensive reputation, and one for steam alternators, or generators attached to the flywheels of reciprocating engines. The former was an extremely profitable department, providing a steady flow of funds for new projects until the 1960s, but the latter posed major financial difficulties which eventually led to a liquidity crisis in 1903. Difficulties with production of the steam alternator were exacerbated by the nature of the firm, because it was a private company, and even though in 1901 Ferranti agreed to a reconstruction which resulted in the establishment of Ferranti Ltd, little external capital could be raised for a firm dominated by family ownership and engineering instincts. Ferranti was, in fact, an incorrigible developer of ideas and machines, interfering constantly with designs as they progressed from the drawing-board into production, and while this technology-led strategy resulted in striking improvements to electrical engineering, it also diverted scarce resources. Intensifying American and German competition also precipitated severe alternator price reductions, and by 1903 the firm's bankers, Parrs, was forced to call in the liquidators after substantial losses appeared in the balance sheet.<h2>
<a name="Reconstitutionanddiversification"></a>Reconstitution and diversification</h2>Ferranti was actually excluded from the Hollinwood works for much of the next eleven years, and even when Ferranti Ltd was reconstituted in 1905 the receiver-managers continued to run the business, using much more conventional accounting and commercial strategies. It was during this time that Ferranti ventured into other development projects, working with J. and P. Coats Ltd on textile machinery, with Vickers on resuperheating turbines, and with J. Hopkinson &amp; Co. on steam stop valves. J. Hopkinson was principally responsible for providing a much enhanced income for Ferranti's expanding family; by 1913 he and Gertrude had had three sons and four daughters. Apart from the stop valve income, he exploited his reputation to act as a consultant to some of the large electricity-supply companies being formed at that time, and by 1913 this improved financial strength had provided the resources for him to buy Baslow Hall, Bakewell, in Derbyshire. It was also during this time that he became involved in industrial politics, helping to establish the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association, a powerful electrical cartel of which he was president in 1912. He was also the first person to take on the presidency of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) for two consecutive years (1910&#150;12), which further reflected his status in the industry by that time. His presidential address in 1910, &#145;Coal conservation, home-grown food and the better utilisation of labour&#146;, was regarded as a clarion call for more ambitious policies in the industry, and while contemporaries regarded the scheme as outlandishly expensive, sixteen years later the Central Electricity Generating Board was working along similar lines. Confirming his reputation, the University of Manchester in 1912 bestowed an honorary degree of DSc on him for services to electrical engineering, and thereafter he was always known at the Hollinwood works as Dr Ferranti.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War, Ferranti decided to commit his considerable energy to converting Ferranti Ltd into a major munitions producer. Although the new management was still mistrustful of him, and sophisticated accounting controls had been introduced as a means of preventing any repeat of the 1903 d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, Ferranti was principally responsible for securing the munitions contracts, developing the necessary mass production techniques, and utilizing the improved flow of profits to diversify the product range. This was, indeed, the period when Ferranti Ltd evolved into the type of organization which survived intact until the 1970s. With Ferranti once again developing a highly successful technology-led strategy, and professional accountants overseeing the finances, the firm was able to flourish in the more conducive environment of the 1910s and 1920s. Over this period Ferranti Ltd diversified into radio and domestic electrical appliances and rebuilt the transformer business which had languished since 1903.<h2>
<a name="Ferrantiandthenationalgrid"></a>Ferranti and the national grid</h2>So successful were Ferranti and his son, Vincent, in improving the fortunes of the transformer department that when the Central Electricity Generating Board was created in 1926 to construct a national supply grid, Ferranti Ltd won the largest single share of the orders for large three-phase transformers, after having persuaded the commissioners to use this type of equipment in place of the planned single-phase equipment. Ferranti did not actually become chairman of the company until 1928, but in the meantime, as technical director, he forged ahead with highly ambitious development schemes which laid a solid foundation for the future.<br>
<br>Since his pioneering work at the Grosvenor Gallery and Deptford in the 1880s, Ferranti had been advocating the construction of a national grid, and while his principal role during the 1920s was as a manufacturer of crucial components in the distribution system, it was widely recognized that he had been a major voice in the movement, urging fundamental changes to what had been an outmoded pattern of electricity supply. In recognition of his achievements, the IEE in 1924 awarded him its highest distinction, the Faraday medal, and in 1927 he was given the ultimate accolade from the scientific community when he was made a fellow of the Royal Society. He also worked diligently as president of the Electrical Development Association (in 1927) and was an influence on the Electrical Association for Women, of which his wife became a leading figure. This was typical of his dedication to the cause of electricity, and at Baslow Hall he applied this form of energy to everything from egg incubators to central heating, demonstrating how in word and deed he led the industry towards his dream of an &#145;All Electric&#146; age. His charming personality, dark good looks, and overwhelming enthusiasm ensured that all who heard him speak were similarly enthralled, and his Faraday lecture to the IEE in 1928, entitled &#145;Electricity in the service of man&#146;, was a fitting r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his lifelong passion for the subject.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>Sebastian de Ferranti died suddenly on 13 January 1930 at the Kantonsspital, Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland, following an operation on his prostate gland which resulted in fatal complications. He was buried in Hampstead cemetery. He had contributed enormously to the development of an electricity supply industry which was just beginning to haul itself out of fifty years of ill-planned development, and in pioneering high-voltage systems he was widely regarded as a major influence on how the technology evolved in the twentieth century. Over a career spanning forty-nine years he took out a total of 176 patents, most of which were applied directly to improving the competitiveness of his several businesses, and in Ferranti Ltd he left a vibrant firm with a genuine commitment to extending the frontiers of engineering knowledge. By elaborating this technology-led strategy he also encouraged many innovative engineers to work there, including H. W. Clothier, E. T. Norris, and C. E. Sparks, all of whom later went on to enjoy successful careers in their own right.<br>
<br>Ferranti Ltd was an enduring legacy of Sebastian de Ferranti's career as an electrical engineer, and on his death it was passed on to his eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_46867"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Gerard) Vincent Sebastian  de Ferranti</span>  (1893&#150;1980)<span class="occ"></span>, more commonly known as Vincent, born on 16 February 1893 at Tedworth Square, Chelsea, London. Vincent was the second son of Dr Ferranti; the eldest, Basil, was killed in 1917 while on active service with the 24th heavy artillery group at Messines. Vincent also enlisted at the outbreak of war in 1914, serving with the 67th field company, the Royal Engineers, and returning home with the rank of captain and the award of the Military Cross, having seen action at Gallipoli and in the Middle East. By 1918 he was very much the heir apparent to Ferranti Ltd, and although he had only a limited secondary education, at Repton School, Derbyshire, his military experience equipped him with the necessary leadership qualities to build on the foundations laid by his father. Dr Ferranti also instilled in him a belief in the value of technological innovation, and by 1921 he had taken over as manager of the transformer department, helping to establish Ferranti Ltd as Britain's leading firm in the design and production of the largest units. At the same time, having witnessed the firm's 1903 crisis at first hand, Vincent recognized the need to maintain a healthy balance sheet, and throughout his career he always stressed the need to maintain a balance between technological and financial priorities.<br>
<br>It was this balanced approach towards business development which Vincent brought to the position of chairman and chief executive when he succeeded his father in 1930. He presided as chairman until 1963, during which time Ferranti Ltd established a position as one of Britain's leading electronics, avionics, and electrical engineering firms. Among the most successful products developed in that period were power transformers, on-board radar equipment, computers, integrated circuits, and numerical control machines, leading to an increase in the net worth of Ferranti Ltd from &pound;600,000 in 1930 to over &pound;12 million by 1963. The business also expanded geographically, with factories being set up in Wythenshawe, Edinburgh, and Bracknell, but Vincent was able to maintain effective control of this empire by monitoring financial trends on a series of graphs he kept in his office, and by calling on his managers in person if matters deteriorated.<br>
<br>Apart from building Ferranti Ltd into a highly innovative and successful business, Vincent also took an active role in the industry's affairs, sitting on the council of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association from 1930, becoming its chairman in 1938, and rising to the presidency in 1957. In addition, in 1946 he became the first son to follow a father as president of the IEE, while on the international scene he was elected chairman of the World Power Conference's international executive committee in 1950. His most notable distinction, however, was the knighthood bestowed upon him in 1948 in recognition of his firm's contribution to the war effort, and this he dedicated to the thousands of employees who made up the wider Ferranti family. Although content in his own family, having married in 1919 Dorothy Hettie Wilson (1901&#150;1985), daughter of Reginald Page Wilson, consulting engineer, and having raised two sons and three daughters, his greatest love was the firm he inherited from his father, and he jealously preserved its familial nature as an intrinsic feature of the drive for technological excellence. It was a passion he also passed on to his eldest son, Sebastian (<i>b</i>. 1928), who succeeded him as chairman in 1963.<br>
<br>Vincent de Ferranti died at his home, Henbury Hall, Henbury, near Macclesfield, Cheshire, on 20 May 1980 and was buried at Henbury on the 25th. His wife survived him.<br>
