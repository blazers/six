<span class="headword">Findlay,  Robert</span>  (1721&#150;1814), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born at Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, on 23 May 1721, the son of William Findlay of Waxford, merchant in the town, and Barbara, daughter of Robert Hodgirt, a Kilmarnock surgeon&#150;apothecary. He was educated at the University of Glasgow, graduating MA in 1737, and at Leiden and perhaps also at Edinburgh. After receiving his licence to preach from the presbytery of Irvine on 5 October 1743 he was ordained to the Ayrshire congregation of Stevenston on 23 August 1744. He was successively the minister of Galston in Ayrshire from 6 June 1745, Laigh Church, Paisley, from 21 March 1753, and St David's Church, Glasgow, from 25 March 1756. While at Galston he married, on 24 April 1745, Annabella (1723&#150;1797), daughter of Robert Paterson of Braehead, the town clerk of Kilmarnock; the couple had three children, one of whom, Robert, survived childhood and rose to become dean of guild in Glasgow. In 1776 Findlay received a DD degree from the University of Glasgow, which he also served as dean of faculty. Two years later he was a candidate for the Glasgow divinity chair but lost it to William Wight by a vote of seven to five among the professors. Wight died in July 1782, however, and on 5 September the faculty elected Findlay the professor of divinity in his place. He assumed his new office in January 1783, when he resigned his charge at St David's. As a divinity professor he was known for delivering a rambling &#145;course of prelections of portentous range and elaborate execution&#146;  (Coutts, 354). In 1800 he also stood fast against the introduction of class fees for divinity students.<br>
<br>The central theme of Findlay's publications was to uphold the divine inspiration of scriptures. Writing as Philalethes, he published &#145;A letter to the Rev Dr Kennicott vindicating the Jews from the charge of corrupting Deut. xxvii.4&#146; in <span class="italic">The Library</span> for July 1761. After Kennicott replied in the same journal in August, he wrote &#145;A second letter&#146; and published it with the first in January 1762 under the same pseudonym as <span class="italic">Two Letters to the Reverend Dr. Kennicott</span>. The following year he produced a pamphlet on psalmody. In 1778, writing once again as Philalethes, he engaged the Revd John Jebb on the subject of prayer in <span class="italic">A letter to the Rev Mr Jebb, with relation to his declared sentiments about the unlawfulness of all religious addresses to Christ Jesus</span>, and in 1781 he appended a second letter to Jebb to his anonymous <span class="italic">Remarks on Mr Lindsey's Dissertation upon Praying to Christ</span>. In 1770 Findlay returned to scriptural apologetics in <span class="italic">A vindication of the sacred books and of Josephus, especially the former, from various misrepresentations and cavils of the celebrated M. de Voltaire</span>, a work of some 600 pages that was inspired by reading a selection from Voltaire's <span class="italic">Philosophy of History</span> in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> in 1765. The same theme defined his last major work, <span class="italic">The Divine Inspiration of the Jewish Scriptures and Old Testament</span>, which appeared in 1803. Findlay died in Glasgow on 15 June 1814, aged ninety-three.<br>
