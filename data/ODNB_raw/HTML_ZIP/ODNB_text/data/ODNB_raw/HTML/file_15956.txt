<span class="headword">Lamplugh,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1615, <em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">archbishop of York</span>, was the son of Christopher Lamplugh (<i>d</i>. in or before 1625) of Little Riston, Yorkshire, and his wife, Anne (1594/5&#150;1661), daughter and coheir of Thomas Roper of Octon in the East Riding of Yorkshire. There is an interpolation in the register of Lamplugh, Cumberland, dating Lamplugh's baptism as taking place on 13 June 1615, but he was probably born and baptized at Thwing in Octon. It appears that Lamplugh went to live with his uncle Thomas Lamplugh of Ribton Hall, Bridekirk, near Cockermouth in Cumberland, and he was sent to St Bees grammar school. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford, on 10 October 1634, aged sixteen, as the son of Thomas Lamplugh of Dovenby, Cumberland, but this entry has been altered with the original stating that he was the son of Christopher Lamplugh and aged nineteen. This alteration may be explained by the fact that Cumbrian students received privileges at Queen's which were not available to those from Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Lamplugh graduated BA on 4 July 1639 and proceeded MA on 1 November 1642, the same year in which he became a fellow of his college. Lamplugh survived the parliamentarian visitation in 1648, taking the covenant, but it seems that he used his weekly lectures each Sunday at St Martin's, Carfax, to uphold the doctrines of the Church of England where, according to Thomas Hearne, &#145;all the honest loyal men in Oxford came to hear him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.48). He also travelled to Bishop Robert Skinner's house at Launton to assist in the private ordination of Church of England clergymen. He proceeded BD on 23 July 1657, and became minister of Holy Rood, Southampton, according to his will &#145;the place where I first began to exercise my ministry publicly&#146;  (Jabez-Smith, &#145;Joseph Williamson and Thomas Lamplugh&#146;, 156&#150;7). In 1659 he became rector of Binfield, Berkshire, and Charlton-on-Otmoor, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, Lamplugh was able to show his true colours. He was named to the royal commission charged with reinstating ejected members of the university. He was created DD by royal mandate on 9 November 1660. Anthony Wood, for one, was unimpressed by Lamplugh's skill in retaining his fellowship, &#145;a great cringer formerly to Presbyterians and Independents, now to the prelates and those in authority&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 1.365). In 1661 Lamplugh was elected to convocation as a proctor by the Oxfordshire clergy. He was presented by the king on 3 July 1663 to the archdeaconry of Oxford, but the appointment was challenged by Thomas Barlow, who received a favourable verdict at the Oxford assizes in March 1664. On 9 November 1663 Lamplugh was licensed to marry Katherine (1633&#150;1671), daughter of Dr Edward Davenant of Gillingham, Dorset. They had five children, three of whom predeceased their mother; one son, also Thomas, survived his father. The king then presented him to the archdeaconry of London, Lamplugh being collated on 27 May 1664. He also became rector of St Anthony's, London. He was admitted principal of St Alban Hall in August 1664, prompting Wood to comment that he had a wife and &#145;looked after preferment; neglected the Hall&#146;  (ibid., 2.19) during his nine-year tenure. He was incorporated at Cambridge University in 1668. He was presented to a prebend of Worcester by the king on 23 May 1669. On 1 July 1670 he was collated vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, remaining there until his elevation to the episcopate. In November 1672 a warrant was issued by the king for Lamplugh to be made dean of Rochester, and he was installed on 6 March 1673, a successor being presented in 1676.<br>
<br>On 3 October 1676 Lamplugh was elected bishop of Exeter, being consecrated on 12 November at Lambeth Palace. Lamplugh was a diligent diocesan, attending services in his cathedral and seeking to win over moderate dissenters to the church. Moreover he promoted the repair of parochial churches. He received a writ of summons for a seat in the House of Lords on 10 February 1677, where he supported the court, holding two proxies at the beginning of the October 1678 session. He delivered the 5 November sermon to the House of Lords in 1678, which was subsequently printed&#151;his only publication. On 15 November he voted to add the test on transubstantiation to the oaths of allegiance and supremacy in the new <span class="roman">Test Bill</span>, thereby evincing his anti-Catholicism. He was also one of eleven peers on 29 November who supported an address from the Commons asking the king to remove the queen from Whitehall. Generally he supported the earl of Danby during this session of parliament. Lamplugh went on visitation in autumn 1679 and was very active in the tory reaction in his diocese, ordering the laws against dissenters, whether protestant or papist, to be put into execution. In April 1680 he reported to Archbishop Sancroft on the suppression of meeting-houses in his diocese. He voted in the Lords on 23 November 1680 against a joint committee with the Commons to consider the safety of the kingdoms.<br>
<br>Lamplugh was one of the few bishops to order James II's second declaration of indulgence to be read in his diocese in May 1688. However, on 28 May he added his signature to the seven bishops' petition for its withdrawal. Lamplugh left Exeter shortly before the prince of Orange arrived in November 1688, after exhorting his flock to remain loyal to King James. His return to London to wait on James resulted in his appointment to the archbishopric of York which had been vacant for over two years. He joined with Archbishop Sancroft and several other bishops on 17 November in petitioning James II for a free parliament. He was duly elected to the see of York on 28 November and was confirmed on 8 December 1688. Thus, following the king's initial flight from London, Lamplugh was a senior figure when the peers assembled on 11 December to oversee the government of the city. Indeed he was often the most senior peer present. On James II's return to London, Lamplugh was one of the bishops attending the king to negotiate concessions to the church. On the eve of the king's second departure Lamplugh said that &#145;if he saw His Majesty's face no more, he hoped that they should meet together in heaven&#146;  (Beddard, 60). However, he supported the request that Prince William take on the administration of the government until the Convention met.<br>
<br>Lamplugh voted for a regency on 29 January 1689 and opposed a motion on 31 January to declare William and Mary monarchs. He voted on both 4 and 6 February against King James having abdicated the throne but he took the oaths to William and Mary on 4 March. On 11 April 1689 he assisted Bishop Compton in crowning the new monarchs. In the Lords, Lamplugh voted against the rehabilitation of Titus Oates in May and July 1689.<br>
<br>Lamplugh died at the archiepiscopal residence, Bishopthorpe, on 5 May 1691, and was buried in York Minster. His will of 2 May prayed for the end to breaches in the unity of the church &#145;that they may no longer rend and tear out the bowels of their tender indulgent but now sadly afflicted mother&#146;  (Jabez-Smith, &#145;Joseph Williamson and Thomas Lamplugh&#146;, 156&#150;7). He remembered Dr Christopher Potter and Dr Gerard Langbaine, both provosts of Queen's College, with bequests to their sons. His son Thomas was his executor.<br>
