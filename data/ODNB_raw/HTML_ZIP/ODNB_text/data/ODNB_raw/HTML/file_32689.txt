<span class="headword">Dadabhoy, Sir Maneckji Byramji</span>  (1865&#150;1953), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician in India</span>, was born in Bombay on 30 July 1865. He came of a much respected Parsi family, the second son of Khan Bahadur Byramji Dadabhoy JP, registrar of joint stock companies and assurances. He was educated in Bombay at the well-known Fort and Proprietary High School, and then at St Xavier's College. In 1884 he married Bai Jerbanoo, second daughter of Khan Bahadur Dadabhoy Pallonji, with whom he had two daughters. In the same year he went to England, was admitted to the Middle Temple, and in 1887 called to the bar. On his return to India he began to practise at the Bombay high court and at an unusually early age was elected a member of the Bombay municipal corporation. In 1888 he was made a justice of the peace. In 1890 he moved to Nagpur and enrolled as an advocate at the court of the judicial commissioner of the Central Provinces. He was appointed manager of Raja Bahadur Laxman Rao Bhonsla's estate in Nagpur, and negotiated the partition of that estate between the Raja Bahadur and his brother. For this he received a record fee, and the case brought him prominence in his profession. He was elected to the Nagpur municipal corporation and served that body for forty years (1890&#150;1930). In 1896 he was appointed government advocate. He found time to write commentaries on the <span class="roman">Central Provinces Tenancy Acts</span> of 1888 and 1898 which became standard works. He was retained by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in connection with the development of its communications in the Central Provinces, and was also associated with the activities of a wealthy Marwari business house in Ahmadabad.<br>
<br>Dadabhoy increasingly moved into the industrial and public life of his province. Through partnership in a mining syndicate, he had a share in the development of the considerable mineral resources of the Central Provinces. He was director of a number of textile mills, founded and was managing director of the Nagpur Electric Light and Power Company, and was managing proprietor of several collieries and other industrial concerns. His interests and ability brought him leadership in the Indian industrial community as a whole. In 1907 he presided at the Central Provinces and Berar industrial conference, and in 1911 he was elected president of the All-India industrial conference in Calcutta. Throughout his public career he took a keen practical and urgent interest in the industrialization of India. He was recognized as an authority on the economic life of the country, and served on a number of commissions dealing with finance and economics, including the Indian fiscal commission (1921&#150;2) and the royal commission on Indian currency and finance (1925&#150;6). From 1920 to 1932 he was a governor of the Imperial Bank of India.<br>
<br>Dadabhoy's long experience of municipal politics served him well when he entered the wider parliamentary field in 1908, as a nominated, and then an elected member of the governor-general's legislative council. He soon established a prominent position as a forceful, independent, and constructive critic of the government of India. In 1921 he was elected to the council of state, to which he was subsequently nominated in 1926, 1931, and 1937. He became its president in 1932. He filled this post with distinction and general acceptance until 1946, when the constituent assembly was established to draw up a constitution for the independent India which was to come into being in 1947.<br>
<br>Dadabhoy was short of stature, and this often left the members of the council of state in some doubt whether their president was standing up or sitting down&#151;a dilemma which gave him much amusement. If short, he was sturdy and robust, and gave the impression of great physical strength. He had an agile mind, shrewd judgement, great tact, and a rare capacity for making friends. His politics were liberal: a friend of John Gorst and a member of the council of the liberal East India Association, he was a committed but moderate nationalist. He was not a supporter of the radicalism of the Gandhian Congress. Although a frequent and candid critic of the government, he was a profound believer in the value of Indo-British partnership and friendship to the Commonwealth and to the world. This conviction was the keynote of his public and parliamentary career and the theme of his outspoken and constructive contribution as a delegate to the second session of the round-table conference in London in 1931. It was also the basis of his conduct during his years as president of the council of state. Throughout some of the stormiest periods in India's political history, he succeeded in exercising his authority and influence with the general support of all parties in the house.<br>
<br>Dadabhoy was gregarious, cosmopolitan, and hospitable. In the United Kingdom he entertained lavishly at Kingsnympton Hall, on Kingston Hill, Surrey. He was a generous host at his spacious house in Nagpur, and at the many social clubs of which he was a member, in Bombay, Delhi, Simla, and Calcutta. For his services in India Dadabhoy was appointed CIE (1911) and knighted in 1921. He was subsequently made KCIE (1925) and KCSI (1936). He died in Nagpur on 14 December 1953.<br>
