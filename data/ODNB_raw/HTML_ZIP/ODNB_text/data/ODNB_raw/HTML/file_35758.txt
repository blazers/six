<span class="headword">Rigg,  James McMullen</span>  (1855&#150;1926), <span class="occ">biographer and historian</span>, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35757/', "James Harrison Rigg (1821&#150;1909)")</script>, principal of the Wesleyan college, Westminster, and his wife, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of John Smith, alderman of Worcester, was born at Brentford on 28 September 1855. He was educated at the City of London School under Dr E. A. Abbott and at St John's College, Oxford, of which he was a scholar. He obtained a second class in classical moderations in 1876 and a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1878. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1880, and was called to the bar in November 1881. He soon abandoned law entirely, and devoted the rest of his life to literary work.<br>
<br>In 1885 Rigg began to write articles for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, to which he contributed more than 600 entries, mainly on the judiciary. Some of his assessments of recent judges were regarded as being rather bold. Besides editing Sir Thomas More's translation of the Latin life of Pico della Mirandola (1890) and writing <span class="roman">a study of St Anselm as thinker and writer</span> (1896) he published valuable editions of the plea rolls of the exchequer of the Jews, covering the thirteenth century, first for the Selden Society (1902) and then for the Jewish Historical Society (1905, 1910). In 1909 Rigg was appointed by the deputy keeper of the records to research in the Vatican archives, and spent nine months of each of the years 1909 to 1915 in Rome. His two volumes of <span class="italic">A Calendar of State Papers &hellip; Rome</span> (vol. 1, 1558&#150;71; vol. 2, 1572&#150;8) were published in 1916 and 1926. All Rigg's editorial work was distinguished by accurate scholarship. He also published a translation of Boccaccio's <span class="italic">Decameron</span> (1903).<br>
<br>In appearance Rigg was spare and ascetic, in manner shy and reserved. He usually spoke abruptly and emphatically, yet in friendly surroundings he was an excellent talker. His greatest interest in life was the history and philosophy of religion. In spite of his Wesleyan origins he seemed to be pleased when anybody mistook him for a Roman Catholic. He died at his home, 79 Brixton Hill, London, on 14 April 1926. He was unmarried, and lived with the elder of his two sisters, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51759/', "Caroline Edith Rigg")</script>, headmistress for forty-one years of the Mary Datchelor School, Camberwell.<br>
