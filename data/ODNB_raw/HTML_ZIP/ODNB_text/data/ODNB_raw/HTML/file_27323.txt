<span class="headword">Thomson,  Robert William</span>  (1822&#150;1873), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, son of John Thomson, a merchant, and his wife, Elspeth (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lyon), was born at Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, on 29 June 1822. He was destined for the pulpit, but, showing little aptitude for academic study, was sent in 1836 to Charleston, United States of America, to be taught the trade of a merchant. In a short time he returned home and began his self-education, aided by a weaver who was a mathematician. After a brief practical apprenticeship in workshops at Aberdeen and Dundee he was employed by a cousin, Mr Lyon, on the demolition of Dunbar Castle. The work was accomplished by blasting, and Thomson conceived the idea of electrically ignited controlled explosions. When Thomson went to London in 1841, Faraday gave him encouragement, and Sir William Cubitt engaged him in connection with the blasting operations on the Dover cliffs. For some time after this he was with a civil engineer in Glasgow, and then worked for Robert Stephenson. In 1844 he began business on his own account as a railway engineer, making plans and surveys for a line in the eastern counties of England.<br>
<br>The collapse of the railway boom in the mid-1840s left Thomson with no employment so he began experimenting with new inventions. He proposed the use of rubber for tyres, taking out a patent on 10 December 1845; but rubber was then too expensive for such general use. He took out a patent on 4 July 1849 for a fountain pen, and contributed his design to the Great Exhibition of 1851. In 1852 he went to Java as agent for an engineering firm, and while there he designed new machinery for refining sugar. This machinery was so superior to anything previously in use that levels of production were greatly increased, and up to the time of his death he continued to supply the best sugar-refining machinery used in Java. Thomson also designed the first portable steam crane for use in the docks of Java. He did not patent the idea, but Messrs Chaplin, who made the first small steam crane for him, had begun mass production of the devices by the time he returned to Britain. The success of Thomson's invention consisted mainly in using the weight of the boiler as a counterpoise to the weight of the jib. In 1860 he visited Europe to oversee the design and construction of a hydraulic dock, based on a series of standardized, interchangeable components. A dock for the French government at Saigon and another for a company at Callao in Peru were successfully constructed on this plan.<br>
<br>In 1862 Thomson retired from business in Java and settled in Edinburgh. He went on to take out patents for improvements in control mechanisms for steam engines, for alterations in the construction of steam boilers, and for &#145;improvements in steam-gauges&#146;. His next invention, the &#145;road-steamer&#146;, was the result of the need for some form of traction engine for the transport of sugar cane in Java, capable of moving over rough, hard surfaces and soft, treacherous ones alike. Thomson returned to his old idea of rubber tyres, and produced what was essentially an early design for a continuous &#145;caterpillar&#146;-tracked vehicle. He took out various patents connected with this invention between 1867 and 1873. The vehicle was very successful, proving the viability of continuous tracks; its chief disadvantage was the use of the very expensive rubber.<br>
<br>Thomson died at his home, 3 Moray Place, Edinburgh, on 8 March 1873. He left a widow, Clara (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hertz); the date and place of their marriage is not known.<br>
