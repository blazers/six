<span class="headword">Playfair,  William Smoult</span>  (1835&#150;1903), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born on 27 July 1835 at St Andrews, the son of George Playfair (1782&#150;1846), inspector-general of hospitals in Bengal, and his wife, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1862), daughter of John Ross. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22368/', "Sir Lyon Playfair")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22369/', "Sir Robert Lambert Playfair")</script>. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22366/', "James Playfair (1738&#150;1819)")</script>, principal of St Andrews University. He was educated first at St Andrews and became a medical student at Edinburgh in 1852, graduating MD in 1856, then worked in Paris. In 1857 he entered the Indian Medical Service and was an assistant surgeon at Oudh during the mutiny. In 1859&#150;60 he was professor of surgery at the Calcutta Medical College, but retired for reasons of health. He practised for six months in St Petersburg, then returned to London without definite plans but was soon elected assistant physician for diseases of women and children at King's College Hospital. In 1872, on the retirement of Sir William Overend Priestley, he was appointed professor of obstetric medicine in King's College and obstetric physician to King's College Hospital, posts which he vacated after twenty-five years' service in 1898, and was elected emeritus professor and consulting physician. In 1863 he became MRCP and in 1870 was elected FRCP. On 26 April 1864 Playfair married Emily, daughter of James Kitson of Leeds and sister of the first Lord Airedale; they had two sons, including the actor and theatre manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35540/', "Sir Nigel Ross Playfair")</script>, and three daughters.<br>
<br>Playfair became one of the foremost obstetricians in this country at a time when physicians rather than surgeons controlled obstetrics. He refused to hand over obstetric operations to the rising general surgeons, and continued to perform them himself. He was a prolific writer with a clear and graceful style. He was the author of the popular <span class="italic">Treatise of the Science and Practice of Midwifery</span> (1876) and co-editor with Clifford Allbutt of a <span class="italic">System of Gynaecology</span> (1896). Playfair introduced the Weir-Mitchell or &#145;rest-cure&#146; treatment into Britain; it was soon widely adopted and later widely criticized, especially by feminists.<br>
<br>Playfair is of particular interest to modern readers because his unintended contribution to medical ethics reveals how attitudes have changed towards medical confidentiality. In the medical literature of his time (and in his entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>), the event is brushed off as trivial but its significance is now seen to be much greater.<br>
<br>In 1896 Playfair was involved in a famous court case. He saw a patient, Linda Kitson, who was also his wife's youngest brother's wife. She had been persuaded to consult him because of gynaecological symptoms, and during her examination Playfair found evidence that she had recently had an abortion, although she had been separated from her husband for a year and a half. Outraged, he decided that he could not allow his immoral relative to associate further with his wife and grown-up daughters and therefore he revealed what had happened to both his wife and one of her other brothers Sir James Kitson. Linda Kitson sued him for breach of professional confidence. The case attracted considerable publicity and Victorian society was riveted by the idea of a middle-class woman's adultery being exposed by a man who was both her physician and her brother-in-law. Playfair asserted in court that he continued to regard Linda Kitson as guilty of &#145;unchastity&#146;, that it was his duty to protect his family's honour, and that his medical conclusions were infallible. Nearly all the doctors who gave evidence supported him. The distinguished doctors who testified that they approved of what he had done included Francis Champneys, Sir William Priestley, Sir William Broadbent, and Sir John Williams. But public, if not medical, opinion increasingly favoured secrecy in medical consultation. The judge was hostile to the suggestion that a doctor had the right to betray a patient's confidences whenever he chose and in his summing-up he depicted a doctor informing on a woman who had aborted as a &#145;monstrous cruelty&#146;  (McLaren, 137). The jury found for Linda Kitson, who was awarded &pound;12,000, reputedly the largest settlement for libel and slander ever made in a British court. (It was later reduced to &pound;9200.) The verdict was greeted in court with loud applause, clapping, and stamping of feet and there was rejoicing in the public press.<br>
<br>The case left doctors in an ethical muddle and it is not surprising that the establishment tried to play it down. It revealed and exacerbated the confusion that existed about medical confidentiality and displayed how preoccupations of class and gender shaped the practices of both law and medicine. The popular press damned Playfair as a &#145;moral inquisitor&#146; and took the view that a woman's character (by which was meant a middle-class woman's character) should never be decided on medical evidence alone. A letter in <span class="italic">The Times</span> referred to Playfair as &#145;an Englishman of the very highest standing torturing a feeble and lonely woman by threats of revealing what he thought he had learned&#146;  (7 April 1896, 6). Yet the medical profession did little to improve the situation. <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> criticized Playfair mildly  (1896, 1.1292); the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> declared that he had acted as any honourable man would, to protect his family  (1896, 1.861). It was widely asserted in medical circles that Playfair had been guilty only of an &#145;indiscretion&#146; and that his practice and reputation did not suffer as a result. Yet the evidence is to the contrary and, despite his prominent position, he received no honour from the queen. He was, however, appointed physician accoucheur to the duchess of Edinburgh and to the duchess of Connaught, an honorary LLD degree of the universities of Edinburgh (1898) and of St Andrews (1885), an honorary fellow of the American and of the Boston gynaecological societies, and of the Obstetrical Society of Edinburgh. He was president of the Obstetrical Society of London (1879&#150;80).<br>
<br>Playfair suffered a stroke at Florence in 1903 and was brought home at the end of July. He died on 13 August 1903 at Webster House, St Andrews, and was buried on 15 August in the east cemetery at St Andrews, where his two distinguished brothers lie. Money was collected to found a memorial to him in the new King's College Hospital at Denmark Hill, London. Among Playfair's possessions at his death was a diamond ring presented to him by the emperor of Russia.<br>
