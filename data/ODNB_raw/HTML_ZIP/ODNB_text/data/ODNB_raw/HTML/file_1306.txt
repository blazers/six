<span class="headword">Baukwell <span class="st"> [Bankwell]</span>,  Roger</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1350), <span class="occ">justice</span>, derived his name from Bakewell in Derbyshire, where he appears to have held property. His parentage is unknown. He is first recorded in Michaelmas term 1314, acting as an attorney in the court of common pleas. During the 1320s he became a pleader in that court, and was created a serjeant at Michaelmas 1329, serving in that capacity at the Northamptonshire eyre of 1329&#150;30. No sooner had he begun to receive commissions of oyer and terminer, and to take assizes, than on 27 February 1331 he was appointed a justice of the bench in Dublin. He may have gone to Ireland&#151;there is a break in the flow of commissions in this year&#151;but the appointment does not seem to have taken effect, and he was certainly back in England by 25 June 1332, when he was made an assessor of tallage in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. On 2 October 1333 he was appointed chief justice of the Dublin bench, but again seems to have failed to establish himself there, and from 1334 his career was restricted to England, and particularly to the north midlands.<br>
<br>As well as being a regular assize justice on the midland circuit, Baukwell received numerous separate commissions. Thus in July 1335 he was appointed to investigate the behaviour of tax collectors in Northamptonshire, Warwickshire, and Rutland. In April 1338 he was ordered to define the boundaries of Sherwood Forest. In April 1340 he was made an assessor and collector of the ninth of wool, sheaves, and lambs in Derbyshire. On 8 January 1341, following Edward III's dismissal of much of the judiciary, Baukwell was made a justice of king's bench, and ten days later was appointed a justice for an abortive London eyre. Later in the same year he was a justice on a commission investigating official misconduct in Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire. A trier of petitions in the parliaments of Easter 1341, Easter 1343, and Hilary 1347, in May 1345 he was added to the panel of justices appointed to hold an eyre (which never took place) in the bishopric of Durham.<br>
<br>In 1346 Baukwell received an increment of 20 marks to his annual salary, and in the same year was one of fourteen justices whom the keeper of the great wardrobe was ordered to provide with cloth and fur for robes. He served in king's bench until Michaelmas 1348, but continued to take assizes and to act as a commissioner after that date&#151;his last commission was issued on 25 June 1350, suggesting that he had survived the black death, but died shortly after the epidemic. Unusually for a professional justice by this date, Baukwell was an ecclesiastic&#151;hence his acting as an assize justice at Lincoln on 18 February 1333, but not as a gaol delivery justice on the following day. His rewards in terms of benefices were fairly modest. In 1339 he was presented to a prebend in the royal free chapel of Penkridge, Staffordshire, where in 1349 he became sacrist; in 1341 he was recorded as parson of Dronfield in north-east Derbyshire.<br>
