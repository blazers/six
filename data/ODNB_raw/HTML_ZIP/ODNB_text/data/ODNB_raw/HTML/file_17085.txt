<span class="headword">Lowe,  Mauritius</span>  (1746&#150;1793), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was the illegitimate son of Thomas, second Baron Southwell (1698&#150;1766), from whom he had a small annuity, but he claimed connection with the family of John Lowe, bishop of Rochester in 1444. He studied with G. B. Cipriani RA at the duke of Richmond's gallery, and was one of the first students to enter the Royal Academy Schools on 9 August 1769, in which year through the interest of Giuseppe Baretti he was the first to obtain the gold medal awarded by the Royal Academy for a historical painting, <span class="italic">Time Discovering Truth</span>. In 1771 he was the first student selected to receive the travelling scholarship for study at Rome, but was &#145;indolent and spent his time in dissipation&#146; and, as he failed to comply with the regulations of the academy, the scholarship was withdrawn in 1772  (Redgrave, <span class="italic">Artists</span>, 276).<br>
<br>Lowe exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1776 and 1779, sending miniatures and his picture <span class="italic">Venus</span>. Lowe enjoyed the friendship and protection of Dr Samuel Johnson, who left him a small legacy. In 1783 he sent a huge picture to the Royal Academy, entitled <span class="italic">The Deluge&#151;there were Giants on the Earth in those Days</span>. This was justly rejected, but at the earnest solicitation of Dr Johnson it was ultimately admitted, though it was hung in an empty room by itself, and universally condemned. In 1777 he exhibited his drawing <span class="italic">Homer Singing the Iliad to the Greeks</span>. He was reputed to be the author of the <span class="italic">Ear-Wig</span> &#145;an abusive art periodical published in 1787&#146;  (Redgrave, 277). Lowe married Sarah, a servant, and had a large family, to one of whom Johnson was godfather. In her diary (2.41) Madame d'Arblay described Johnson's efforts to obtain work as a portrait painter for Lowe, and the state of filth and misery to which Lowe and his family were reduced. Lowe resided for some time in Hedge Lane, London, and later in a miserable lodging in Westminster, where he died on 1 September 1793, leaving one son and two daughters. (For Johnson's god-daughter see <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, 28 May 1873.) In the print room at the British Museum there are three drawings by Lowe, two being for a large painting, <span class="italic">Royal Power, assisted by Wisdom and Virtue, defending the constitution of Great Britain against the attacks of Sedition and Licentiousness</span>, which was engraved by George Graham and published in 1793. Other drawings, in the style of Fuseli, are <span class="italic">Abraham Offering up Isaac</span>, <span class="italic">Adam and Eve</span>, and <span class="italic">Daedalus and Icarus</span>.<br>
