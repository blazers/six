<span class="headword">Whaite,  Henry Clarence</span>  (1828&#150;1912), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Bridge Street, Manchester, on 27 January 1828, the son of Henry Whaite (1803&#150;1869), carver and gilder, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Slater (1802&#150;1865). His parents had developed a successful business known as Whaite's Fine Art Gallery, which dealt in pictures, manufactured frames, and painted banners. While participating fully in the business (painting armorial devices, for instance), like many other children from artisan backgrounds Whaite developed an ambition to become an art painter, and on leaving Manchester grammar school was able to study at the Manchester School of Design.<br>
<br>In 1850 Whaite travelled in Switzerland and Germany. He had wished to return the following year but, finding his intentions frustrated, he went instead to Wales to paint, a visit that proved crucial in the development of his career. He was captivated by the subject matter presented by the mountain scenery of Snowdonia, which at that time was attracting the attention of many young painters from the north-west of England. They were drawn in particular to Betws-y-coed in the Conwy valley, where since 1844 David Cox had been a regular summer visitor. Whaite met Cox at Betws in 1852 and over the next decade became a well-known figure among the painters and photographers who frequented the area.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, although Wales was now established as the prime source for his painting, in the development of his career Whaite remained closely associated with his colleagues in Manchester. He was among the early members of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts, established in 1859, and held the first major exhibition of his own works in the family gallery in 1864. During the same period Whaite also devoted energy to the development of his career in London, honing his technical skills at Leigh's academy and at the Royal Academy Schools. He showed his work at various London exhibitions and, from 1854, frequently at the Royal Academy. In 1859 he was rewarded for his efforts when an oil, <span class="italic">The Barley Harvest</span>, and a drawing of Snowdon attracted the attention of Ruskin, who wrote favourably about them in his <span class="italic">Academy Notes</span>. At this time Whaite was moving on the periphery of the Pre-Raphaelite circle, having joined the Hogarth Club by 1860. In the early 1860s his London reputation was confirmed by election to the Royal Watercolour Society.<br>
<br>From the early 1850s Whaite had underpinned his landscape and subject exhibition pictures by working in the open air in pencil and watercolour on a small scale. Entirely for his own reference, he produced hundreds of studies of landscape, weather effects and the common people at work, which displayed not only exceptional technical facility in their simplified, notational form, but a naturalism that seems, in retrospect, remarkable for its period. In addition to his many visits to the Conwy valley and Snowdonia, he also travelled to work in south-west Wales and in south-west England in 1859 and 1863, in Scotland in 1864, and in Italy in 1870, though that visit was relatively unproductive, the hot weather being little to his northern taste. In the series of large oils that he exhibited in the early 1860s Whaite was also breaking new ground. Most notably, <span class="italic">The Rainbow</span> (1862; Castle Museum and Art Gallery, Nottingham), a canvas some seven feet wide, was painted in the open air at a temporary studio that Whaite constructed in the mountains near Capel Curig. The picture took two seasons to complete, during the first of which he worked in close proximity to Benjamin Williams Leader, whose <span class="italic">A Quiet Valley amongst the Welsh Hills</span> (1860; Worcester City Museum and Art Gallery) presents an overlapping panorama. However, Whaite's picture was more radical in technique, being composed of minute dots of interactive pure colour. It was painted with reference to M. E. Chevreul's <span class="italic">The Laws of Contrast of Colour, and their Application to the Arts</span> (a copy of the 1860 English edition of which he owned), two decades before the influence of the book was expressed in a similar way by Seurat in France.<br>
<br>Whaite's work was also more complex in meaning than that of Leader. He was a devout Christian, brought up in the nonconformist tradition, and for him there existed a close relationship between painting the unsullied mountain landscape and meditation on God's purpose in the creation. In some large-scale pictures he included figures loosely suggestive of contemplative meanings and occasionally representing specific narratives, as in <span class="italic">The Penitent's Vision</span>. In this painting Whaite sought to combine truth to observed nature with an overlaid visualization of the mystical experience of the Christian penitent. The work was rejected by the Royal Academy in 1865 but, divided and reworked with narrative reference to <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> as <span class="italic">The Awakening of Christian</span> and <span class="italic">The Shepherd's Dream</span> (1884; NMG Wales), it found favour with the selection committee nearly twenty years later. Whaite's deep admiration for G. F. Watts, with whom he corresponded, is apparent in this and in later works of biblical mysticism, such as <span class="italic">Lot and the Two Angels</span> (1897; priv. coll.).<br>
<br>In the early 1870s Whaite decided to live permanently in the Conwy valley, establishing himself at Tyddyn Cynal, Y Gyffin, on the west bank of the river. On 3 February 1876 he married a local woman, Jane Alice Griffiths (1836&#150;1906), and they had one child, Lily Florence Whaite (1876&#150;1959), who also became a painter. Reflecting the growing strength of Celtic and nationalist sentiment in Wales, Whaite painted a number of Welsh subject pictures, including the large watercolour <span class="italic">The Finding of Taliesin</span> (1875&#150;6; priv. coll.). Although he was not among the founding group of painters who in 1881 set about the establishment of what became the Royal Cambrian Academy, Whaite was soon involved with its evolution. The combination of his commitment to Wales and his established reputation in Manchester and London led to his election as first president of the Royal Cambrian Academy in 1885, a position he held until his death. Nevertheless, in 1892 his continuing relationship with the city of his birth was recognized when he was elected life president of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts. He was given a large one-person exhibition at the City Art Gallery in Manchester in 1898.<br>
<br>Whaite continued to work both in watercolour and on large scale mystical landscapes in oil (<span class="italic">Snowdon</span>, 1910&#150;11; NMG Wales) until late in his life. He died at Tyddyn Cynal on 5 June 1912 and was buried at Llangelynnin New Church three days later.<br>
