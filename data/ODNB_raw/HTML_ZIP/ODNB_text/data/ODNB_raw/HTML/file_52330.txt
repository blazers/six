<span class="headword">Penfold,  Charles</span>  (1798&#150;1864), <span class="occ">surveyor and valuer</span>, was born on 26 May 1798 in Croydon, Surrey, the third of ten children of Thomas Penfold (<i>b</i>. 1771), Croydon vestry clerk (1796&#150;1834), and his wife, Edith. On 16 January 1822 he married Catherine Mary Chrees (<i>d</i>. 1866). His younger brother George, a solicitor, was vestry clerk from 1835 to his early death in 1852, by which time he was also clerk to the Croydon local board of health, established in 1849.<br>
<br>Penfold was an authority on rating and road making, whose evidence to the select committee on turnpike trusts and tolls (1836) was drawn upon by Sidney and Beatrice Webb for their famous book on the king's highway. In 1824 he and John Maberley, MP for Abingdon, of Shirley Park, Croydon, were elected surveyors of the parish roads. Only Penfold received a salary, and from 1828 his name appears alone. He held the office until Maberley left the parish because of bankruptcy in 1833. Penfold complained to the select committee that, after he had reduced the annual expenditure on roads from &pound;1500 to &pound;470, the vestry proposed halving his salary of 100 guineas before taking up the offer of an amateur road maker, James Willoughby, to perform the work gratuitously. In 1837 Penfold was elected to the newly established board of highways, which employed Willoughby as surveyor, and continued as a member to Easter 1849, soon after which the board's functions were taken over by the local board of health. He was one of the surveyors of the Surrey and Sussex Turnpike Trust, responsible for about 100 miles of road, holding the post for thirty years, and was also surveyor of the Croydon and Reigate Trust.<br>
<br>Penfold first published his views on road making in 1834, eventually being published for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in the third volume, <span class="italic">Husbandry</span>, in 1840 as &#145;A practical treatise on the best mode of repairing roads&#146;. He recommended county hundreds employing general surveyors to supervise parish surveyors, and advocated replacing statute duty by piece work, surfacing roads with a thin layer of hard, well-broken stones, and raking and watering the surface to keep it settled.<br>
<br>The board of highways made him responsible for examining the plans of the London and Brighton Railway Company, whose lines crossed the parish, to see how they affected the roads and footpaths, while his brother was employed in instigating litigation. In January 1842, just before Lord Denman's judgment about railway companies paying the poor rate in <i>R. v. London and South Western Railway Company</i>, Penfold wrote a letter to the <span class="italic">Railway Times</span> which attracted sufficient attention for him to write a series of letters on the rating of railways. He upheld Lord Denman's view that railways should be rated upon their total earnings, less expenses, not just upon tolls payable by any lessee. These letters were the start of a number of publications on the rating of railways, especially <span class="italic">The Principle and Law of Rating</span>, first published in 1847, which reached a fourth edition during his lifetime and, as <span class="italic">Penfold on Rating</span>, an eighth edition in 1893. Penfold believed in helping parishes benefit from the increased value of the land the railways occupied; as a valuer he assisted a number of parishes to make fresh valuations in the light of Lord Denman's judgment. The London, Brighton, and South Coast Company, later taken over by the South Eastern, appealed unsuccessfully against his valuation for the Croydon rate, by which the company paid a third of the total rates collected.<br>
<br>When the local board of health was being established Penfold had hopes of becoming its surveyor. He gave evidence to the public inquiry led by William Ranger, superintending inspector of the General Board of Health, presenting his own plan for supplying Croydon with water and sanitation. In <span class="italic">A letter to the Right Hon. the earl of Carlisle upon the drainage of the town of Croydon under the Health of Towns Act</span> (1849) he maintained he had been offered the post of surveyor and criticized the plans adopted by the board. His criticisms of the board may have been fuelled by the realization not only that his own standing in Croydon had been diminished&#151;the board had not shortlisted him&#151;but also that the dynastic rule of the Penfolds had been replaced by that of the Drummonds&#151;John Drummond being vestry clerk from 1852 to 1880, and his brother William chairman of the local board of health from 1853 to 1862. Penfold moved to Brunswick Square, near Holborn, about 1853, having had for some years an office in the City, first in Cornhill and then in St Helen's, Bishopsgate. He died on 23 May 1864.<br>
