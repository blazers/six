<span class="headword">Howey,  (Rose) Elsie Neville</span>  (1884&#150;1963), <span class="occ">suffragette</span>, was born at Finningley, Nottinghamshire, on 1 December 1884, the daughter of Thomas Howey (1851/2&#150;1887), rector of Finningley, and his wife, Emily Gertrude (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Oldfield). Following Thomas Howey's death, the family moved to the Malvern area which remained Elsie's home for life. Although details of her childhood are sparse, Elsie was educated to a good standard, and in 1902 enrolled in St Andrews University for a standard arts degree course, taking classes in English, French, and German. For unspecified reasons she did not complete her studies, but left in 1904 to travel to Germany. Here &#145;she first had occasion to realise women's position&#146; and determined to work to improve it  (<span class="italic">Votes for Women</span>, 18 June 1908).<br>
<br>In December 1907 Elsie encountered the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) campaigning in a by-election at Ross. With her mother and elder sister Marie 
    (Mary Gertrude Oldfield Howey; 1882&#150;1967)
   she joined the union. Both Howey girls embraced militant tactics and were arrested and gaoled in February 1908 when, with other suffragettes, they hid inside a pantechnicon and were &#145;delivered&#146; into the House of Commons. For Elsie this marked the beginning of a dedicated WSPU career. She soon joined a group of young &#145;freelance militants&#146; undertaking daring independent actions for the cause. A loyal and popular suffragette, she was motivated as much by friendship as political conviction. In January 1910 when Lady Constance Lytton, disguised as a working-class woman, was arrested and forcibly fed in Walton gaol, Elsie broke the governor's windows and was also gaoled in order that Lady Constance should not suffer alone. Constance Lytton felt this made Elsie the &#145;most dear one of our members&#146;  (C. Lytton and J. Warton, <span class="italic">Prisons and Prisoners: some Personal Experiences</span>, 1914, 247). Elsie also drew sympathy from less expected quarters. In December 1912, when she was gaoled for two months for giving a false fire alarm, seventy-five &#145;working men and farmers&#146; from Malvern wrote to their MP demanding a reduced punishment for their &#145;much loved&#146; local suffragette  (<span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, 27 Dec 1912).<br>
<br>Although an active militant, Elsie did not eschew the more mundane sides of WSPU work. Early in 1909 she responded to a call for &#145;young women with private means&#146; to work as honorary WSPU organizers for a year. Supported financially and morally by her mother, Elsie spent the next year working in Plymouth and Torquay where she helped to establish a suffragette presence. She also achieved national recognition that year when she headed a WSPU demonstration through London dressed as Joan of Arc, in a full set of armour, &#145;astride a great white charger&#146;  (Pankhurst, <span class="italic">Suffragette Movement</span>, 367).<br>
<br>From 1910 Elsie was &#145;in the vanguard&#146; of militancy  (<span class="italic">The Suffragette</span>, 3 Jan 1913). She underwent at least six imprisonments. This hides the full extent of her daring as she was skilled at escaping arrest. In September 1909 with two others she climbed into Lympne Castle, Kent, where the prime minister was staying, and demanded &#145;votes for women&#146; through the dining-room window while the Asquiths dined. The suffragettes escaped via an adjacent canal. On the occasions that she was arrested, Elsie demonstrated total dedication to her cause, undergoing several hunger strikes and enduring forcible feeding. Her final imprisonment was in December 1912. This time she was released early following a prolonged hunger strike which prompted questions in parliament, although the anonymous friend who paid her fine was too late to prevent forcible feeding from breaking most of Elsie's teeth.<br>
<br>Tired and ill, Elsie vanished from public life when militancy ended in 1914. She remained in Malvern but followed no career, and never fully recovered from the sacrifices she made in the name of the WSPU. She died on 13 March 1963 at the Court House Nursing Home, Court Road, Malvern, from chronic pyloric stenosis, almost certainly connected to her numerous forcible feedings. Aside from about &pound;2000 in personal legacies, she left the residue of her &pound;23,000 estate to the English Theosophical Trust. She gave instructions in her will for cremation and the scattering of her ashes, requesting &#145;that no funeral service of any kind shall be held for me&#146;. Her cremation took place at Worcester.<br>
