<span class="headword">Vorteporius</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>540), <span class="occ">king of the Demetae</span>, whom Gildas in his <span class="italic">De excidio Britanniae</span> calls &#145;tyrant of the Demetae&#146;  (Gildas, cap. 31), is probably the Voteporix commemorated in a bilingual (Latin and Irish) inscription formerly at Castelldwyran in the west of Carmarthenshire in the heartland of early medieval Dyfed. The form of the name in the Irish inscription would fit a sixth-century date, while the traditional date of <i>c</i>.540 for Gildas's <span class="italic">De excidio Britanniae</span> is unlikely to be far out. The Latin, in square capitals, runs as follows:<blockquote>
<div>MEMORIA<br>
</div>
<div>VOTEPORIGIS<br>
</div>
<div>PROTICTORIS<br>
</div> (Nash-Williams, no. 138)</blockquote>This is usually translated &#145;The memorial of Voteporix &#147;protector&#148;&#146;. The Irish inscription on the same stone contains only the name and is in the ogham alphabet: Votecorigas. The person commemorated was, therefore, known both by a British name and by its Irish cognate. The Irish version of the name suggests that he belonged to the Irish settlers in Dyfed; this is corroborated by the appearance of forms of the name Vorteporix in, first, an Old Irish text about the migration of the D&eacute;ssi (the people whose name is preserved in the baronies of Decies in Waterford) and, second, in Old Welsh genealogies of the mid-tenth century. Both the Irish and the Welsh versions of the pedigree of the kings of Dyfed agree with Gildas, however, in inserting an &#145;r&#146; into the name (Gildas has the name in the vocative, Vortipori&#151;&#145;O Vortiporius&#146;). Gildas's tyrant was, according to him, the wicked son of a good father, namely, if the pedigree is reliable, Aircol (Agricola). The father is described as king; here, then, as elsewhere, Gildas was using &#145;tyrant&#146; of a king of evil conduct rather than of a ruler who took power by a coup. As with his other wicked tyrants, Vortiporius had distinguished himself by vicious conduct both domestic and familial: killing male kinsmen and having sexual intercourse with his own daughter.<br>
<br>Solutions of the problem posed by different forms of the name start from the title used in the inscription, <i>protector</i>. In the later Roman empire the term <i>protector</i> was used for one of the two corps of &eacute;lite bodyguard troops (<i>domestici</i> and <i>protectores</i>). Typically the <i>protectores</i> served as staff officers and were likely to receive high military office as the next step in their careers. The term remained in use in the successor states, as in a Burgundian inscription:<blockquote>HARIULFUS PROTECTOR DOMESITICUS EILIUS [filius] HANHAUALDI REGALIS GENTIS BURGUNDIONUM (Le Blant, <span class="italic">Nouveau recueil des Inscriptions de la Gaule</span>, no. 38)</blockquote>Here both titles, <i>protector</i> and <i>domesticus</i>, are used, making it doubly clear that the reference is to the Roman institution. On the other hand, the name Voteporix has the literal meaning &#145;Refuge-King&#146;, and this has led Celticists to wonder whether the Latin title might not be a gloss on the name, or, on the other hand, whether the name might not, in origin, have been a title corresponding to the Latin <i>protector</i>. Some knowledge of the title <i>protector</i> seems to have come down to the tenth-century compiler of the Harleian genealogies: he inserts the title some generations above his Guortepir in the pedigree of the Dyfed kings.<br>
<br>The two most likely solutions to this entangled problem begin, in the first case, from the suggestion that the form with &#145;r&#146; is a deformation of the form without &#145;r&#146;&#151;Vortipori of Votepori&#151;and, in the second case, from the proposal that the two names stood for different but related men, both belonging to the royal kindred of the Demetae (compare Hariulf, a member of the Burgundian Gibichung dynasty). The first explanation has to face the difficulty that a supposedly deformed version of the name was the one recorded in the genealogies; the second has to meet the objection that the Old Welsh genealogy suggests that its Guortepir (with an &#145;r&#146;) was connected with the title <i>protector</i> (as in the inscription, which does not have &#145;r&#146;). The first explanation sees the two names as standing for the one person; according to it, the person commemorated in the inscription was indeed Gildas's Vortiporius. For the second they were not the same person, but rather kinsmen.<br>
