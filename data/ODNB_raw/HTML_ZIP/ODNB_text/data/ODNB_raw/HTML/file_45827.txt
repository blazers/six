<span class="headword">Stirredge <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tayler, Tayer]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1634&#150;1706), <span class="occ">Quaker prophet and autobiographer</span>, was born in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, of strict puritan parents, William Tayler or Tayer, and his wife. Spurred on by the preaching of John Audland and John Camm in 1654, and the ministry of William Dewsbury and Miles Halhead, Elizabeth was convinced in 1655, when she was twenty-one. Her marriage to James Stirredge the younger (<i>d</i>. 1708), fellow Quaker and native of Somerset, on 6 May 1663, produced &#145;three daughters and three sons&#146;  (Bell, Parfitt, and Shepherd, 183).<br>
<br>In January 1670, five years after Miles Halhead predicted her call to prophecy, Elizabeth Stirredge delivered a written testimony to Charles II, urging him to halt the persecution of the Friends; according to her later account, when she handed him the testimony the king turned &#145;pale&#146;, and &#145;with a mournful Voice he said, <i>I thank you, Good Woman</i>&#146;  (Stirredge, 39&#150;40). Her involvement with the Wilkinson&#150;Story controversy also began in 1670, as she contested John Story's attempts to persuade the Keynsham Friends to meet privately rather than publicly, in order to avoid fines, imprisonment, and the seizure of their goods. She also contested Story's rejection of the call of Quaker women to prophecy and testimony. While Story reduced to tears &#145;two good Women&#146; who had &#145;been upon the Service of Truth, and had good Testimony&#146;, he found Stirredge unwilling to heed his injunction that Quaker women should &#145;go home about their Business, and wash their Dishes, and not go about to preach&#146;. Uttering against Story &#145;a dreadful Testimony&#146;, Stirredge later turned a memorable domestic metaphor against her opponent, crying out at a Bristol meeting, &#145;Woe to that Spirit that dimned the Glory of the Lord, and woe to that Pot that the Scum remains in it, for in it is the Broath of abominable Things&#146;  (Stirredge, 82&#150;3, 91). In her autobiography she exposed the hypocrisy of Story's objection to the yearly, monthly, and women's meetings as an imposition of doctrine upon individual conscience, by recording Story's dismissal of her own conscience as the grounds upon which she could legitimately oppose him.<br>
<br>Stirredge's public testifying continued at the appraising of her family shop's seized stock in 1674, and at a particularly tense incident in 1683, when she prevented a mob from immolating the Chew Magna Friends in their meeting-house. A written prophecy to the mayor of Bristol in 1680 was followed in 1683 by her imprisonment in Ilchester gaol, Somerset, along with other Friends from Chew Magna, including her husband, James. They survived extreme winter conditions exacerbated, according to Stirredge, by the malice of the keeper Giles Bale and his wife, who refused them straw to lie on, confining the men and women together along with felons awaiting execution. While imprisoned Stirredge wrote <span class="italic">A Salutation of my Endeared Love in God's Holy Fear &hellip; unto You of that City of Bristol</span> (1683), encouraging persecuted Friends and prophesying apocalyptic judgment on Bristol. Released from Ilchester gaol, she and her family left Chew Magna for Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, in 1688. A year later a second prophetic testimony, <span class="italic">A Faithful Warning to the Inhabitants of England, and Elsewhere</span>, appeared&#151;focusing on God's imminent wrath and the necessity for national repentance. In 1692 Stirredge completed her spiritual autobiography, <span class="italic">Strength in Weakness Manifest &hellip; in the Life, Various Trials, and Christian Testimony of &hellip; E. S.</span> (from which much of her biography is derived). It revealed her spiritual trials and triumphs, and her concerns over the future of the Quaker movement; it was not published until 1711. The bodily weakness from which she had always suffered increasingly restricted her travel and testimony, though she continued to attend meetings in Hertfordshire and yearly meetings in London. She died aged seventy-two, on 7 November 1706, in Hemel Hempstead. She rests in the Quaker burial-ground at Wood End, Hertfordshire.<br>
