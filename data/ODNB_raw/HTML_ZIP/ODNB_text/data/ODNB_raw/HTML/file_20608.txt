<span class="headword">Ogle,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1704, <em>d.</em> 1746), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was the second of six children of the attorney-at-law Samuel Ogle of Bowsden (1658&#150;1718), MP for Berwick and commissioner of the revenue for Ireland, and his second wife, Ursula (1678&#150;1725), who inherited Irish estates and other wealth both from her parents (Sir Robert Markham of Sedgebroke, and Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Widdrington of Sherburn Grange) and from her first husband, Lord Altham Annesley of co. Cork (<i>d</i>. 1699). From his father's first marriage to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1697), widow of Thomas Dawson of Newcastle, Ogle also had a half-sister. At least two of his brothers pursued military careers, Robert in Ireland and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68721/', "Samuel Ogle")</script> in North America.<br>
<br>Although Ogle's father attended university at Edinburgh, and his son at Dublin, Ogle apparently learned from tutors the classical languages underlying his best-known writings: a dozen Horatian imitations, individually published from 1735 to 1739, that tend more toward jocularity than workaday translation. <span class="italic">Satire</span>, ii.5, becomes, for example, <span class="italic">Of Legacy Hunting &hellip; Dialogue between Sir Walter Raleigh and Merlin the Prophet</span> (1737). Another representative poem, dedicated to Ogle's elder brother Samuel while he was governor of Maryland, imitates Horace's <span class="italic">Epistle</span>, i.11, with jokes about the shortage of culture and taste in Annapolis (<span class="italic">The Eleventh Epistle</span>, 1738).<br>
<br>Ogle primarily resided and published in London. In 1735 he married Frances (1711&#150;1750), the daughter and coheir of Sir Thomas (sometimes referred to as Frederick) Twysden of East Peckham. As landholder in Ireland, he might be the George Ogle who in 1737 served as MP for Bannow and high sheriff for co. Wexford. His father died in Dublin; and his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20609/', "George Ogle (1742&#150;1814)")</script>, would long serve as MP for Wexford. Besides the son Ogle and his wife had two older daughters, Frances and Catherina-Isabella.<br>
<br>Nine years before his marriage to the heiress, Ogle had &#145;addrest to a young lady&#146; <span class="italic">The Liffy</span> (1726), based on Ovid. Next he published imitations of Anacreon, Sappho, and other Greek poets in James Sterling's <span class="italic">Loves of Hero and Leander</span> (1728), which is dedicated to the &#145;ingenious young gentleman&#146; Ogle. His publications may have influenced Alexander Pope's adaptations of Horace and Thomas Moore's of Anacreon (P. Dixon, &#145;Pope, George Ogle, and Horace&#146;, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 204, 1959, 396&#150;7; <span class="italic">Journal of Thomas Moore</span>, ed. W. S. Dowden, 6 vols., 1983&#150;91, 2.768). Besides working independently, Ogle composed an epilogue for Henry Brooke's <span class="italic">Gustavus Vasa</span> (1739), which was banned in London but staged in Dublin  (<span class="italic">Prologues and Epilogues of the Eighteenth Century</span>, ed. P. Danchin, 6 vols. to date, 1990&#150;, 5.60&#150;61). He collaborated also with Elijah Fenton and Edward Ward, to translate the sixteenth-century Latin <span class="italic">Basia (Kisses)</span> of Janus Secundus (1731), and with engraver Claude de Bosc for <span class="italic">Antiquities Explained</span> (1737; 2nd edn, <span class="italic">Gemmae antiquae caelatae</span>, 1741). This tome reproduces fifty carvings, for each of which Ogle quotes passages in Greek and Latin, provides his own and others' translations, and interweaves commentary that often justifies the figures' nudity. His final publication mocks a vain woman grown old and ugly  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 15, 1745, 48). In 1926 Ogle's reputation for mild erotica caused his name to become erroneously but persistently attached to an essay by Bernard Mandeville  (<span class="italic">A Modest Defense of Publick Stews, 1724</span>, ed. R. Cook, 1973).<br>
<br>Ogle pursued mild erotica within his own vernacular tradition as well as in Graeco-Roman art and literature. In 1739 he published <span class="italic">Gualtherus and Griselda</span>, amalgamating the versions of Boccaccio, Petrarch, and Chaucer. He then assembled <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales of Chaucer, Modernis'd by Several Hands</span> (3 vols., 1741). Besides his own <span class="italic">Clerk's Tale</span> he supplied a modernization of Edmund Spenser's continuation of the <span class="italic">Squire's Tale</span> (as <span class="italic">Cambuscan</span>, concluded in 1785 by Joseph Sterling), and he adapted the <span class="italic">General Prologue</span> by Thomas Betterton (a pseudonym for Alexander Pope). Ogle also modernized links between tales.<br>
<br>Perhaps Ogle intended to supply modernized links and tales for the rest of Chaucer's work, but he died on 20 October 1746. To his heirs he left homes in the country (Hendon, Middlesex) and in the city (on Audley Street, his parish church being St George's at Hanover Square). He also left lands in Kent, Sussex, and Ireland; many possessions including furniture, plate, jewels, and a coach; and thousands of pounds. Most went to his wife, daughters, and trustees; to young George he bequeathed his books and bookcases.<br>
