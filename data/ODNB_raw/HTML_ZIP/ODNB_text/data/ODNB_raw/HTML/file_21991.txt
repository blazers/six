<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Perry,  Charles</span>  (1807&#150;1891), <span class="occ">bishop of Melbourne</span>, was born on 17 February 1807, the third son of John Perry of Harlow, sheriff of Essex and shipbuilder, and his second wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Green). After Harrow School (1819&#150;23) Charles followed his brothers to Trinity College, Cambridge; he graduated BA (1828) with first-class honours as senior wrangler, seventh classic, and first Smith's prizeman. He began legal studies at the Inner Temple in London in 1828 but returned to Trinity after his health collapsed in 1831; he had already qualified for a Trinity fellowship in 1829 and he graduated MA in 1831, and was a tutor between 1832 and 1840.<br>
<br>Perry's assiduous attendance at Trinity College chapel reflected a strong maternal religious influence, and later his introduction to wider evangelical circles helped to clarify his religious uncertainties. Perry sought ordination and was made deacon by Bishop J. H. Monk of Gloucester on 16 June 1833; he was ordained priest on 26 November 1836 by Bishop J. Allen of Ely. To academic duties Perry added pastoral enterprise: he bought the advowson to St Andrew-the-Less, Cambridgeshire, and built two churches&#151;Christchurch, Barnwell (1839), and St Paul's New Town (1842), of which he became the first vicar in 1845. In 1840 he resigned his Trinity fellowship to marry Frances (1815&#150;1892), daughter of Samuel Cooper, a Hull merchant. They married on 14 October 1841; there were no children.<br>
<br>Perry advocated the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and better theological education within English universities; this attracted attention, and Lord Grey, then colonial secretary, followed the recommendation of the CMS secretary, Henry Venn, to nominate Perry to the new see of Melbourne. Archbishop Howley agreed, and Perry was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 29 June 1847, along with William Tyrrell (Newcastle, New South Wales), Augustus Short (Adelaide), and Robert Gray (Cape Town). Perry was installed in St James's pro-cathedral on 28 January 1848, and his letters patent designated Melbourne a city and made his territorial jurisdiction coterminous with Victoria (which was given self-government in 1851). The population of his diocese was 43,000, and half was Anglican, served by three clergy. Perry's extensive use of lay readers attracted criticism but it helped to remedy severe shortages of clergy and funds.<br>
<br>Perry's legal training soon gauged the limits of applying the English established church's laws, which he had inherited along with the religious pluralism of the new British settlement. Exercising his potentially despotic powers as a colonial bishop rendered him vulnerable to criticism by ardent local democrats. In urging fellow bishops and home authorities to modify the church laws, he argued that the Anglican laity warranted a greater (if unaccustomed) share both in parochial appointments and in their denomination's wider government. Here he disagreed with his metropolitan, Bishop Broughton of Sydney, but found a strong ally in Bishop Selwyn of New Zealand. Six Australasian bishops met in Sydney in October 1850 to promote greater colonial church self-government, though they disagreed on how to achieve it. Accused of Erastianism, Perry recommended that colonial church constitutions be based on imperial or local legislation rather than on consensual compact alone. After the Commons rejected Archbishop Sumner's <span class="roman">Church Regulation Bill</span> (1853), Perry incorporated its provisions into a bill exclusively for the Church of England in Victoria. It passed Victoria's legislative council in November 1854, and Perry and his wife then brought it to England, where it received royal assent on 12 December 1855. The bill became a model, giving many Australian and Canadian dioceses a legislative autonomy that still kept them an integral part of the Church of England, fully sharing in its standards of faith, order, and discipline.<br>
<br>During Perry's episcopate, responsibility for education in Victoria shifted from church to state. Perry disliked the state system, which minimized religious education, yet he recognized how rival denominational schools misused scarce resources. Personally preferring a voluntary system for supporting both clergy and schools, he publicly conceded that the survival of Anglican parishes and schools depended on state aid. Victoria abolished state aid between 1872 and 1875; many Anglican elementary day schools closed. Perry's own diocese, with its active synod, at first struggled for financial survival, but then grew solidly, and his greatest contribution to education in Victoria lay in establishing Melbourne grammar school (1849) and Geelong grammar school (1857) to train young male colonial leaders in sound liberal learning and the Christian faith. Perry also encouraged the foundation of Trinity College at Melbourne's university in 1860.<br>
<br>The discovery of gold in August 1851 transformed Victoria (its population increased tenfold between 1850 and 1860) and reinforced Perry's drive for church self-government to help the church to adapt. Acclimatization had limits, and Perry's churchmanship and sense of Anglican order frustrated his laity's wish to co-operate with the presbyterians in sustaining ministry in a vast rural hinterland. By 1869, however, the diocese warranted subdivision, its 113 clergy, 162 churches, and 75 parsonages reflecting wider support than state aid or Perry's pocket could ever have given. The bishopric of Ballarat goldfields became financially viable, and Perry and his wife left for England in 1874, ostensibly to help choose its new bishop. Samuel Thornton was appointed. In 1876 Perry resigned the Melbourne see, and helped to find his own successor, James Moorhouse, and to consecrate him on 22 October 1876.<br>
<br>In 1878 Perry became Bishop Selwyn's successor as prelate of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was also appointed a residential canon of Llandaff Cathedral and was an active CMS vice-president and a committee member of both the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge; between 1874 and 1888 he regularly and earnestly advocated colonial and evangelical viewpoints at church congresses. His upbringing and later evangelical conviction made him abhor &#145;Romanism&#146; and regard Anglo-Catholic ritualism as corrupting, opposed to the literal meaning of the articles and the prayer book, contrary to law, and subversive of church unity and growth. Concerned for the reformed Catholic, or protestant, character of his former diocese, his attempts to impose doctrinal tests on potential successors angered Archbishop Benson and other nominators in 1886. Never obscurantist, Perry's sermons openly discussed biblical criticism and scientific issues, and seeking an informed clergy he had helped to found Ridley Hall, Cambridge, in 1881, and chaired its council, submitting its new members to doctrinal tests.<br>
<br>Perry's church statesmanship regarded respect for court-interpreted church law as the necessary bond of Anglican unity and integrity. Accordingly he opposed Bishop Gray of Cape Town in 1869 in the latter's determination to flout privy council decisions by appointing a successor to Bishop Colenso in Natal. However, his adamant doctrinal and ecclesial convictions made Perry unpopular and isolated, and his strong intellect and opinions went unmatched by force of personality. His stern exterior nevertheless concealed affection and a willingness to sacrifice personal interests for higher goals. Scrupulously impartial, he rarely nursed bitterness, and his moral example remained unquestioned.<br>
<br>Perry died on 2 December 1891 at his home at 33 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, London, and was buried three days later at Harlow, Essex. His widow Frances died exactly twelve months afterwards.<br>
