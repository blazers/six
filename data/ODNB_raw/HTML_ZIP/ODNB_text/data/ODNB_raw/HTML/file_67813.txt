<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Loraine,  Robert Bilcliffe</span>  (1876&#150;1935), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 14 January 1876 at 5 Mersey Terrace, New Brighton, Cheshire, the son of Henry Loraine (1819&#150;1899), actor, and his wife, Mary Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayliss (1848&#150;1895), an actress with the stage name of Edith Kingsley. Robert Loraine, who was educated privately, made his first appearance on the stage at the age of thirteen and was first seen in London in 1894 at the age of eighteen. He quickly became a leading player in both London and New York, appearing constantly in both cities: <span class="italic">Who's Who in the Theatre</span> lists his roles in fifty-six London productions and twenty-seven New York productions between 1894 and 1932. In 1897 he married Julie Opp, an American actress, daughter of a Bavarian-horn New York saloon keeper. Following their divorce, in 1901 he married Winifred Lydia, daughter of Sir Robert Strangman; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>A man of action, between 1899 and 1901 Loraine served as a volunteer in the South African War. He was a pioneer of aviation and made the first flight across the Irish Sea in 1910. During the First World War he distinguished himself in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), winning the MC and the DSO b in 1917 and twice being seriously wounded. He retired from the army at the end of the war with the rank of lieutenant-general and immediately returned to the stage.<br>
<br>Loraine's range as an actor was very wide and throughout his career he was just as ready to play in light, popular box-office successes as in plays of more substance. The remarkable fact was that he was equally adept in either. While he was still in his early twenties he established himself as a leading &#145;romantic&#146; actor (a &#145;matin&eacute;e idol&#146;, in fact) in such popular melodramas as <span class="italic">The Prisoner of Zenda</span> by Anthony Hope and <span class="italic">The Three Musketeers</span>, in which he played D'Artagnan in 1899. Lightweight comedies were also Loraine's forte, and he starred in <span class="italic">Frocks and Frills</span> (by S. Grundy), <span class="italic">Pretty Peggy</span> (a musical play by A. Rose and C. Austin), and <span class="italic">Dolly Reforming herself</span> (by H. A. Jones), as well as a number of others.<br>
<br>In addition Loraine appeared in a number of major Shakespearian roles between 1896 and 1927. His Prince Hal impressed H. M. Walbrook, the critic of the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in 1909, who commented that his association with Falstaff &#145;was at least as much a matter of intellectual curiosity as of any particular partiality towards riot and dishonour&#146;  (Walbrook, 96). Loraine's other &#145;classical&#146; parts included Young Marlow in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (1909), Charles Surface in R. B. Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1909), Bob Acres in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (1910), and Mirabell in W. Congreve's <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span> (1924). He played the eponymous hero in two different productions of Rostand's <span class="italic">Cyrano de Bergerac</span>, one in 1919 in Edinburgh and the other in 1927 in London.<br>
<br>Loraine was especially associated with Bernard Shaw: they once went for a balloon flight together, along with Harley Granville Barker, over London and almost drowned together on a seaside holiday in Wales. Loraine played Jack Tanner in <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span> in 1907 (taking over the part from Granville Barker) and again under his own management in 1911 and on subsequent occasions in London and New York. His other Shavian parts included Bluntschli in <span class="italic">Arms and the Man</span> in 1907 and again in 1919 and 1926, St John Hotchkiss in <span class="italic">Getting Married</span> in 1908, and O'Flaherty in <span class="italic">O'Flaherty VC</span> at an army camp in Belgium in February 1917 while he was a serving RFC officer. This being the first production of the play, Shaw himself attended the dress rehearsal, in spite of the curious location and the dangers of war. Shaw, in fact, was very fond of Loraine, whom he saw as a good example of the man of action who is also an artist, a type he greatly admired. On his army enlistment papers Loraine listed Shaw and Mrs Shaw as next of kin. In some ways Loraine stood in the same relationship to Shaw that Granville Barker had stood before him and T. E. Lawrence was to stand after him&#151;the ardent young man who became a surrogate son.<br>
<br>Throughout his long career Loraine was an actor who was very popular with the general public. Yet a number of leading theatre critics commented favourably on the quality and depth of his work in serious drama. In 1907 Max Beerbohm considered he was excellent as Jack Tanner at the Court Theatre in the first production of Shaw's <span class="italic">Don Juan in Hell</span> (derived from act <span class="smallcap">III</span> of <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span>). Beerbohm wrote that &#145;He seems to be really thinking, really evolving the ideas he has to express, and really rejoicing, too, in his mastery of debate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, 8 June 1907). Shaw directed the play and, ten days before it opened, wrote to Granville Barker that Loraine &#145;who always starts a company by sacking at least three members of it after the first rehearsal to intimidate the rest&#146; had &#145;got all the comedy side of the part capitally and does it quite in my old-fashioned way, with a relish and not under protest, like you&#146;  (Purdom, 85). Desmond MacCarthy, reviewing Loraine's performance of the title part in <span class="italic">Deburau</span> (by Sacha Guitry, translated by Granville Barker) in May 1921 agreed that Loraine was &#145;a most accomplished elocutionist; indeed, about the best on the stage&#146;  (MacCarthy, 69). James Agate, the leading British theatre critic of his day, noted the excellent pairing of Loraine's Mirabell with the Millament of Edith Evans in <span class="italic">The Way of the World</span> in 1924: &#145;The part was beautifully spoken and the actor used only the suavest and most gentle notes in his voice. He listened exquisitely&#146;  (Agate, <span class="italic">Red Letter Nights</span>, 35).<br>
<br>Loraine's stature as an actor was perhaps shown to best effect in his Strindberg performances in the late 1920s: he got excellent notices for his major roles in <span class="italic">The Father</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">The Dance of Death</span> (1928). Agate, reporting in 1928 on Loraine's performance as Edgar in the latter play, considered that Loraine's acting was<blockquote>magnificent throughout, and as masterly in its implications as in its detailed craftsmanship. While fully satisfying the eye in the matter of the paralytic stroke and so forth, he kept our minds occupied not with the tricks of the crumbling body but with the cancerous sweep of evil imagination. (Agate, <span class="italic">Red Letter Nights</span>, 123)</blockquote>Writing in 1951, J. C. Trewin got the measure of Robert Loraine when he described him as &#145;an actor never afraid of mountaineering&#146;  (Trewin, 194). Daring in his choice of roles, he refused to follow, unthinkingly, earlier and traditional interpretations.<br>
<br>Loraine died in the Golden Square Hospital, Westminster, London, on 23 December 1935. In 1938 his widow published a popular biography of him.<br>
