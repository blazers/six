<span class="headword">Bagnold,  Enid Algerine</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Enid Algerine Jones, Lady Jones]</span>  (1889&#150;1981), <span class="occ">novelist and playwright</span>, was born at Borstal Cottage, Rochester, Kent, on 27 October 1889, the elder child and only daughter of Major (later Colonel) Arthur Henry Bagnold (1854&#150;1943), a military engineer, and his wife, Ethel (1866&#150;1931), daughter of William Henry Alger, who inherited a large chemical and fertilizer factory at Cattedown and became mayor of Plymouth. Her younger brother, with whom she was close, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52630/', "Ralph Alger Bagnold (1896&#150;1990)")</script>. Enid Bagnold spent three years of her childhood in Jamaica, where her father was posted, and then lived at Woolwich, before going to Prior's Field school, Godalming, run by the stimulating Mrs Leonard Huxley.<br>
<br>Enid Bagnold was a tomboyish, dramatic, outdoor, beautiful girl who soon escaped the conventionally respectable life of her parents by taking a flat in Chelsea, and for several years she studied art under Walter Sickert. She made friends easily among members of the marginally Bohemian set, including Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who sculpted her. In 1912 she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33727/', "James Thomas (Frank) Harris (1856?&#150;1931)")</script>, then aged fifty-six, who employed her as a journalist on his magazine <span class="italic">Hearth and Home</span>, and with whom she had her first love affair.<br>
<br>In the First World War Bagnold worked as a nurse in a London hospital, and described her experiences in <span class="italic">A Diary without Dates</span> (1918, 2nd edn 1978), imagining herself writing to Antoine Bibesco, the Romanian diplomat whom she loved for many years with an unrequited passion. Within half an hour of the book's publication she was sacked by her matron for indiscipline, but it had an instantaneous success, H. G. Wells describing it in <span class="italic">The Dream</span> (1924) as one of the most human books written about the war.<br>
<br>Enid Bagnold thus achieved fame while still in her twenties, and her ambition never slackened. Her vitality, humour, audacity, and grace made her an exhilarating companion. She was ebulliently communicative, in talk as in writing, as lavish with words as a pianist is with notes, loving the inexhaustible variety of human experience as much as the language which expressed it. She was, however, too fond of the great and grand to be taken seriously by the literary establishment (apart from Sir C. O. Desmond MacCarthy, one of her closest friends), and in the view of one critic she remained &#145;a brilliantly erratic amateur&#146;. Her literary strength lay in her gift for narrative, dialogue, and domestic scenes, for which she drew extensively on her own experience and the characters of her friends.<br>
<br>On 8 July 1920 Bagnold married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34227/', "Sir (George) Roderick Jones (1877&#150;1962)")</script>, chairman and managing director of Reuters. &#145;Their partnership&#146;, wrote her biographer Anne Sebba, &#145;was marked by loyalty, not fidelity, respect but not passion&#146;, but for their children, three sons and a daughter, Enid's affection was unstinting. Her intimate friend Vita Sackville-West wrote of her in an unpublished poem:<blockquote>
<div>I never loved you, Enid, save as a friend,<br>
</div>
<div>But as a friend I loved you nearly, dearly,<br>
</div>
<div>You wild rash girl, so young, less flesh than bones,<br>
</div>
<div>And then came Jones, and flesh succumbed to Jones<br>
</div>
<div>And domesticity destroyed you in the end.<br>
</div> (MS poem at Sissinghurst)</blockquote>In London the Joneses entertained generously, and it was there, in a study designed for her by Sir Edwin Lutyens, and at their Sussex home, North End House, Rottingdean, that she wrote joyfully but intermittently, having no need to write for money.<br>
<br>Her first novel, <span class="italic">The Happy Foreigner</span> (1920), describing her experiences as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse in France, was followed by <span class="italic">Serena Blandish</span> (1924), about a poor girl in search of a rich marriage. Then came a book for children, <span class="italic">Alice and Thomas and Jane</span> (1930), and in 1935 she published her best known book, <span class="italic">National Velvet</span>, the story of a butcher's daughter who wins a piebald horse in a raffle and, disguised as a boy, wins the Grand National. In 1944 it was made into a hugely successful film, with the youthful Elizabeth Taylor in the starring role. Her next novel, which she and many others considered her best, was <span class="italic">The Squire</span> (1938), a daringly outspoken description of the relationship between a mother (unmistakably herself) and the child to whom she gives birth.<br>
<br>In 1941 Bagnold wrote her first play, <span class="italic">Lottie Dundass</span>, about a stage-struck typist who dies of a heart attack after her first and only performance. It was an instant success in America and England, and Enid thereafter devoted her talent to the theatre, apart from one more novel, <span class="italic">The Loved and Envied</span> (1951), a story of high life clearly based on her friend Lady Diana Cooper, and her autobiography (1969). As a dramatist she had several failures, including <span class="italic">Gertie</span> (1952), <span class="italic">The Last Joke</span> (1960), and most disastrously, <span class="italic">Call me Jacky</span> (1967), but in compensation she enjoyed one major triumph with <span class="italic">The Chalk Garden</span> (1955), which ran in London for two years and was described by Kenneth Tynan as possibly the finest English comedy since those of William Congreve, and one critical success, particularly in America, with <span class="italic">The Chinese Prime Minister</span> (1964). She involved herself intensively (too intensively for many of the actors and directors) in the production of all her plays, and continued writing until late in her eighties, when she reworked <span class="italic">Call me Jacky</span> into <span class="italic">A Matter of Gravity</span> (1975). Her last published books were a selection of her poems (1978) and <span class="italic">Letters to Frank Harris and other Friends</span> (1980).<br>
<br>Enid Bagnold's husband died in 1962, and the last years of her life, despite the devotion of her children, became increasingly lonely. She needed regular injections to dull the pain of her arthritis, but she remained gallantly active, describing herself, characteristically and truthfully, as &#145;an old lady masking a sort of everlasting girl inside&#146;. She was appointed CBE in 1976.<br>
<br>Enid Bagnold died of bronchopneumonia on 31 March 1981 at 17a Hamilton Terrace, London. Her ashes were buried at Rottingdean, Sussex, after her cremation at Golders Green.<br>
