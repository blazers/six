<span class="headword">Woodlock <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mahony]</span>,  Ellen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>H&eacute;l&egrave;ne]</span>  (1811&#150;1884), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born on 27 January 1811 in Cork, the daughter of a wealthy woollen merchant, Martin Mahony, and his wife, Mary Reynolds. The family were strong financial supporters of the newly emerging Roman Catholic religious communities of women during the early nineteenth century. It seems likely that Ellen was educated in France, as was her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17800/', "Francis Mahony (1804&#150;1866)")</script>, who later became famous as a writer under the pseudonym Father Prout. Little is known of her early life or of her marriage in 1830 to Thomas Woodlock, which ended when she was widowed about 1834. The couple had one son, Timothy, born shortly after the death of Thomas.<br>
<br>It appears that Ellen Woodlock spent the years following her husband's death in France and played some role in establishing the congregation of Les Dames de Saint Louis in 1842. By 1843 she was herself living as a sister in its convent at Juilly, her name in religion being S&#339;ur H&eacute;l&egrave;ne; her son was educated by the sisters in a school nearby. She returned to Cork on three occasions to recruit members for the newly formed congregation. By 1851, however, she had been dispensed from her vows: it appears that she was considered &#145;eccentric&#146; by members of the community. She herself was no longer attracted to the teaching mission of the St Louis congregation and wished to engage in a more active form of philanthropy; her interest was primarily in the care of children.<br>
<br>On returning to Cork, Woodlock established an industrial school in the city in 1851. She became an important figure in the Irish industrial and reformatory school movement. In 1852 she moved to Dublin, where she became a close friend of the writer and philanthropist Sarah Atkinson (1823&#150;1893), and organized St Joseph's Industrial Institute in 1856. Here she took girls from the workhouse and attempted to provide them with skills to earn an independent living. She was a close friend of John Lentaigne, then director of government prisons in Ireland, and was strongly supported by him in her attempts to encourage the spread of industrial and reformatory schools. In 1858 she was instrumental in bringing members of the St Louis congregation to Monaghan to open a reformatory school, and in 1861 she gave evidence before a House of Commons select committee on poor relief in Ireland, where she spoke of the need to have children removed from the contaminating influences of the workhouse. She also took part in the Social Science Congress meeting held in Dublin in 1861, and with Sarah Atkinson spoke on the condition of children in the workhouses.<br>
<br>Together with other Catholic philanthropists Woodlock formed a children's hospital in Dublin in 1873; it was handed over to the Sisters of Charity in 1876 and was later known as Temple Street Children's Hospital. Woodlock was part of a small group of lay Catholic philanthropists who supported the work of convents through raising funds and initiating enterprises which were later given to the care of nuns. Her friendship with Charles Bianconi (1786&#150;1875), the successful promoter of the Irish car system, for example, encouraged him to give &pound;12,000 to the St Louis sisters in Monaghan to purchase buildings for their reformatory. Woodlock was also among the first group of lay Catholics to engage in workhouse visiting in the 1860s. She died after a short illness at the home of her son, 8 Sydney Place, Cork, on 13 July 1884, and was buried in St Joseph's cemetery in the city.<br>
