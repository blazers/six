<span class="headword">Bairstow, Sir  Edward Cuthbert</span>  (1874&#150;1946), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born in Huddersfield on 22 August 1874, the eldest child and only son of James Oates Bairstow, wholesale clothier, and his wife, Elizabeth Adeline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. His father had a tenor voice and was a member of the Huddersfield Choral Society. Bairstow was educated at the high school, Nottingham, where his grandparents lived, until in 1889 his father retired and the family moved to London where he attended the Grocers' Company's School at Hackney Downs, and later had coaching from a private tutor. In Huddersfield he had been taught the organ by Henry Parratt (brother of Sir Walter Parratt), and in Nottingham by Arthur Page. Soon after arrival in London he had lessons from John Farmer, then organist of Balliol College, Oxford, and later (1892&#150;9) he was articled to Sir Frederick Bridge, organist of Westminster Abbey. During this time he became organist of All Saints' Church, Norfolk Square, Paddington. In 1894 he obtained the degree of BMus at Durham University, proceeding to DMus in 1900. In 1899, on Bridge's recommendation, he was appointed organist of Wigan parish church and he conducted the Wigan Philharmonic Society (1901&#150;6) and also the choral society at Blackburn. On 11 June 1902 he married Edith Harriet (<i>b</i>. 1875/6), daughter of John Thomas Hobson, a government inspector of alkali works. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1906 Bairstow was appointed to the more important post of organist at Leeds parish church. In addition to his church duties he had a busy life teaching, lecturing, performing, composing, and travelling each week to conduct the Blackburn St Cecilia Society (1903&#150;13) and the Preston Choral Society (1907&#150;13). At the Leeds triennial festival in 1907 he was official organist under the conductorship of Sir Charles Stanford.<br>
<br>Another chapter of Bairstow's life began in 1913 when he became organist and master of the choir at York Minster, where he remained until his death. The increased duties of his cathedral work made it impossible for him to continue conducting the choral societies in Lancashire but, now that his reputation as a choral trainer was established, he accepted the invitation to conduct the York Musical Society (1913&#150;39), the Bradford Festival Chorus, and the Leeds Philharmonic Society. At York Minster, Bairstow's devoted work with the choir and music generally became well known and widely appreciated and perhaps reached the highest level of excellence during the 1300th celebrations in 1927. The Bairstows' home at 1 Minster Court, York, became well known for its hospitality towards other artists.<br>
<br>In the 1920s Bairstow became known as a judge at musical competition festivals in Britain, and in 1928 he also judged in Canada. His natural ability, teaching experience, and fearless judgements had a stimulating effect on the movement. He was much in demand, although he realized that he was not &#145;popular&#146;; consequently he often remarked &#145;I have judged at every competition festival in the country&#151;<i>once</i>.&#146;<br>
<br>On the death of Joseph Cox Bridge in 1929, Bairstow accepted the chair of music at Durham University. The professorship at that time was non-resident and he was able to continue his work at York Minster. At Durham he set himself to raise the standard of the degree in music. In 1932 he was knighted, and he received the honorary degrees of LittD (1936) from Leeds and DMus (1945) from Oxford. For various periods he held office as president of musical bodies such as the Incorporated Society of Musicians and the Royal College of Organists; of the latter he was for many years an examiner and member of the council.<br>
<br>Probably Bairstow's chief influence was through his many pupils, who included the composer Gerald Finzi. He was a born teacher, although his strictness and insistence on regular, disciplined work did not endear him to all his pupils, Finzi among them. His success was due to his uncanny insight into the problems of teaching, to his sympathy, patience, perseverance, enthusiasm to stimulate the imagination of the pupil, appreciation of honest work done, and above all to his great love of music. His courage, forthright speech, and transparent sincerity made him greatly beloved by many, even though they were sometimes misunderstood by and embarrassing to a few.<br>
<br>Bairstow published two textbooks on music, <span class="italic">Counterpoint and Harmony</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">The Evolution of Musical Form</span> (1943), and one on singing, <span class="italic">Singing Learned from Speech</span> (1945), written in collaboration with his friend H. Plunket Greene. His published compositions, which reveal the influence of Brahms and Stanford, include church and organ music, songs, partsongs, and chamber music. For the coronation of George VI in 1937 he wrote the introit. His 1913 communion service in D was perhaps his most important work, while the austerely beautiful anthem &#145;Let all mortal flesh keep silence&#146; became firmly established in the repertory of church music. Bairstow died in Purey Cust Nursing Home, York, on 1 May 1946.<br>
