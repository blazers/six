<span class="headword">Potter,  Thomas</span>  (1718?&#150;1759), <span class="occ">wit and politician</span>, was born at Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire, probably in 1718, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22612/', "John Potter (1673/4&#150;1747)")</script>, bishop of Oxford and later archbishop of Canterbury, and his wife, the granddaughter of Thomas Venner. His older brother was disinherited after making an unsuitable marriage, and Thomas inherited all his father's wealth, estimated to have been between &pound;70,000 and &pound;100,000. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 18 November 1731, aged thirteen, graduated BA in 1735 and MA in 1738, was admitted to the Middle Temple on 27 February 1735, and was called to the bar on 8 November 1740. Later he held the recordership of Bath. On 17 February 1740 Potter married unwillingly, at his father's behest, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 1716, <i>d</i>. 1744), the daughter of Thomas Manningham, rector of Slinfold, Sussex, and his wife, Mary. He wrote &#145;I am &hellip; unhappy, miserable beyond remedy. In short I am married&#151;and married to a woman I despise and detest.&#146; It was said that he treated her with calculated brutality, though he claimed on her death on 4 January 1744 that he had been &#145;deprived of what was most dear to [me] in the world&#146;. They had one son, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1801), who was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and became a judge. On 14 July 1747 Potter married Anne, the daughter of Francis Lowe of Brightwell, Oxfordshire, who brought with her a fortune of &pound;50,000; they had two daughters.<br>
<br>Potter used his inheritance, and his post of principal register to the province of Canterbury, to embark upon a career in politics. He was initially an adherent of the prince of Wales, and after the prince's death of the Grenville faction. Between 1747 and 1754 he sat for the borough of St Germans in Cornwall, through the patronage of the Eliot family, and from 1748 until the prince's death in 1751 was secretary to the prince of Wales. Potter made an immediate impact in parliament in his first session by attacking the conduct of the duke of Newcastle, who was accused of having exercised undue influence in the 1747 election at Seaford in Sussex. Lady Hervey commented on the incident:<blockquote>Mr Potter the lawyer is a second Pitt for fluency of words. He spoke well and bitterly, but with so perfect an assurance, so unconcerned, so much master of himself, though the first sessions of his being in parliament and first time of opening his mouth there, that it disgusted more than it pleased. (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Lepel</span>, 110&#150;11)</blockquote>The speech was widely published and elicited an anonymous response from Horace Walpole in the form of <span class="italic">A Letter to a Certain Distinguished Patriot, and most Applauded Orator</span> (1748).<br>
<br>Potter's second noteworthy contribution in parliament was over the proposed bill for removing the assizes from Aylesbury to Buckingham, a result of the contest between Lord Chief Justice Edward Willes and the Grenville faction. In 1751 Potter himself proposed an additional duty of 2<i>s</i>. on spirits, and in the session 1753&#150;4 he introduced a <span class="roman">Census Bill</span> which, though it passed the Commons, was thrown out by the Lords. The scheme was not successfully revived until 1801. In 1757 he criticized the ill-fated expedition against the port of Rochefort, which led to a pamphlet war with Henry Seymour Conway. From 1754 to 1757 Potter sat for the borough of Aylesbury, and he soon allied himself with Pitt the elder. He was on Pitt's list of candidates for high office, but was initially barred by the king. In 1756, however, he was re-elected at Aylesbury and appointed paymaster-general of the land forces. The following year he was appointed joint vice-treasurer of Ireland, a post he held until his death.<br>
<br>It is, however, chiefly for his behaviour outside parliament for which Potter is particularly remembered. Though in poor health, he was thought extremely good-looking and witty. According to John Nichols, he is believed to be the handsome candidate depicted in Hogarth's election series. In the early 1750s he was one of George Bubb Dodington's constant guests at La Trappe and was &#145;among the more vicious of Bubb's intimates&#146;  (Fuller, 114). He was also a member of the bizarre fraternity established by Sir Francis Dashwood known as the Medmenham Monks, or <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71306', "Franciscans")</script>. This set was a secret society which met in the ruins of St Mary's Abbey, Medmenham, and held obscene and blasphemous orgies parodying the Roman Catholic mass. Other members included the earl of Sandwich, Lord Orford, and John Wilkes.<br>
<br>Potter was one of the most enthusiastic members of this club, and was frequently held responsible for the moral and financial ruin of his close associate Wilkes. Potter, described as Wilkes's &#145;evil genius&#146;  (Thomas, 4), has been seen as the instigator of Wilkes's early excesses, for &#145;richer, looser, and more a man of the world, he initiated him [Wilkes] into a circle which scandalized even the eighteenth century &hellip; It is clear &hellip; that it was he and not Wilkes who was the leader&#146;  (Postgate, 23). Even Potter's best friends remonstrated with him at his behaviour, but his response to such pleadings was typical: &#145;It is injudicious to tell a Sinner that he must imitate a Saint. The impossibility makes him too desperate even to begin the attempt&#146;  (Fuller, 116). Potter was not responsible for writing the scurrilous <span class="italic">Essay on Woman</span>, for which Wilkes was prosecuted for obscenity in 1763. The <span class="italic">Essay</span> had been written by Wilkes in 1754 and met with Potter's approval; he wrote to Wilkes on 27 October that year: &#145;I have read your parody, for the ninety-ninth time, and have laughed as heartily as I did at the first&#146;  (Thomas, 4).<br>
<br>As well as introducing Wilkes to the Franciscans and the Grenville faction, Potter was involved with the triangular deal that established him in parliament. In July 1757 a vacant seat at Bath was occupied by Pitt, leaving Pitt's seat at Okehampton free for Potter, which opened Aylesbury to Wilkes. The arrangement cost Wilkes some &pound;7000, and to pay for it Potter introduced him to the Jewish financiers, who later contributed to his financial ruin.<br>
<br>Potter died &#145;of a long Decay&#146; at Ridgmont, near Woburn, on 17 June 1759, &#145;unrepentant to the end&#146;  (Fuller, 168). According to his wishes, his body was dissected, and his lungs and liver were found to be much decayed. He was buried on 25 June in the churchyard at Ridgmont &#145;at the west end of the belfry, in a place where no one was used to be buried&#146;. He was borne by six labourers, representing three counties, and his body was interred in three coffins, one of which was lead. His estate passed to his daughter Mariana and her husband, Malcolm Macqueen (<i>d</i>. 1829), a physician.<br>
