<span class="headword">Stanger,  Christopher</span>  (1759&#150;1834), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the son of Daniel Stanger, a merchant of Whitehaven, Cumberland, and his wife, Hannah. He was baptized at Holy Trinity, Whitehaven, on 1 January 1760. His family had for several centuries owned estates near Keswick, and a township to the west of Derwentwater once bore their name. Stanger studied under the Revd Fisher at Kirkoswald and was later apprenticed to Mr Abbs, a surgeon in Newcastle upon Tyne. He graduated MD at Edinburgh on 24 June 1783. His dissertation bore the title, &#145;De iis quae ad sanitatem conservandam plurimum conferre videntur&#146;. He then studied for four years at Paris, Vienna, Montpellier, G&ouml;ttingen, and Leiden.<br>
<br>On his return Stanger established a practice in London, and was admitted LRCP on 30 September 1789. The following year he was appointed Gresham professor of medicine, and in 1792 became physician and governor to the Foundling Hospital. In June 1793 Stanger was chosen to act with John Cooke (1756&#150;1838) and William Charles Wells on a committee formed by the licentiates of the Royal College of Physicians to present an address to the college claiming to be admitted fellows. The petitioners were excluded from fellowship of the college under a by-law which declared that fellows should be graduates of Oxford or Cambridge: this despite the eminence of the Edinburgh medical school. The college refused to receive the address, and Stanger applied to the law courts. On 27 January 1796 the court of king's bench granted a rule to compel the president and fellows to show cause why they should not admit Stanger. On 23 April, when Erskine appeared for the defendants, the rule was discharged by Lord Chief Justice Kenyon on the ground of an informality in Stanger's application. The case was reopened in the autumn and was argued by Adair, Law, Chambre, and Christian for the plaintiffs, with Erskine, Warren, and Gibbs for the defendants, 13&#150;16 May 1797; but the court unanimously refused the mandamus.<br>
<br>In 1798 Stanger appealed to the public in <span class="italic">A justification of the right of every well-educated physician of fair character and mature age, residing within the jurisdiction of the College of Physicians of London, to be admitted a fellow if competent</span>. The pamphlet showed that Lord Mansfield had decided in 1767 that the college were bound under their charter to admit as fellows all duly qualified licentiates of whatever university. But Stanger's efforts produced little effect. Isaac Schomberg had unavailingly put forth a somewhat similar claim in 1753. Stanger, who possessed extensive attainments and great energy, also published <span class="italic">Remarks on the Necessity and Means of Suppressing Contagious Fevers in the Metropolis</span> (1802), and contributed a paper on coughs to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Medical and Chirurgical Society</span>. He died in London on 21 September 1834.<br>
