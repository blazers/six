</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilkinson, Sir  Geoffrey</span>  (1921&#150;1996), <span class="occ">inorganic chemist</span>, was born on 14 July 1921 at 506 Halifax Road, Springside, near Todmorden, Yorkshire, the eldest of three children of Henry Wilkinson (1885&#150;1975), master painter and decorator, and his wife, Ruth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Crowther (1891&#150;1962), weaver. Both his parents came from Yorkshire and moved to the centre of Todmorden in 1926, to 4 Wellington Road: the house is marked by a blue plaque erected in his honour in 1990, and in 1997 another plaque was erected in the town hall.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandeducation"></a>Early life and education</h2>Wilkinson's interest in chemistry came early: he was fascinated by watching his father mixing his painting materials, and by visiting the laboratory of his uncle, the manager of a small chemical factory making Epsom and Glauber's salts in Todmorden. He won a West Riding county scholarship in 1931 to Todmorden secondary school; the school had many other pupils later to become famous, including Sir John Cockcroft, who became in 1951 the first of its two Nobel laureates. Though at different times, Cockcroft and Wilkinson had the same physics teacher. Wilkinson was a brilliant pupil and won a royal scholarship to Imperial College, London, starting there in 1939.<br>
<br>Wilkinson found life at Imperial competitive: in the year before his was another future Nobel laureate, Derek Barton, who like Wilkinson later rejoined the college as a professor. He read chemistry but also studied geology as an ancillary subject. He did so well at this that he won the prestigious Murchison prize in geology&#151;indeed he thought at one point of giving up chemistry in favour of geology. He graduated in 1941 with the top first-class honours BSc of the year, and started work towards his PhD under H. V. A. (Henry) Briscoe (then the only professor of inorganic chemistry in the country) on &#145;Some physico-chemical observations on hydrolysis in the homogeneous vapour phase&#146;. This rather Delphic title concealed the fact that the main substance studied (probably part of Briscoe's war research) was the intensely toxic phosgene. Wilkinson remarked that Briscoe &#145;directed his Ph.D. research from a safe distance&#146;.<h2>
<a name="NorthAmerica"></a>North America</h2>Towards the end of 1942 Wilkinson was selected by the Joint Recruiting Board to join the British contingent on the atomic energy division of the Canadian National Research Council (part of the &#145;Tube Alloys&#146; atomic bomb project). He sailed out on the RMS <i>Andes</i> from Greenock to Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 11 January 1943&#151;recalling that the scientists were supposed to travel first class, but that his room, clearly marked &#145;for one seaman only&#146;, had to be shared with three other scientists. Some interesting incidents occurred while he was on the project. He witnessed an accident in which a glass vessel containing heavy water (then a virtually priceless material used for moderating nuclear reactions), which had been smuggled from the Norwegian heavy water plant out through occupied France, had been dropped so that all the liquid spilled on the floor. Most of it was recovered by hurriedly mopping it up with handkerchiefs. Some time later a solution containing a precious 20 mg of the intensely toxic and radioactive plutonium nitrate boiled over onto a wooden bench and soaked into it; it was retrieved by sawing up the bench and extracting the wood and sawdust with boiling water. Safety was not a prime consideration: Wilkinson would routinely pick up intensely radioactive radium-beryllium neutron sources with his fingers. In Montreal and at Chalk River he worked with many celebrated names&#151;among them Pierre Auger, John Cockcroft, Charles Coryell, Bertrand Goldschmidt, Jules Gu&eacute;ron, Alfie Maddocks, and two figures later to find notoriety as Soviet spies, Alan Nunn May and Bruno Pontecorvo.<br>
<br>In 1946 Wilkinson became a research fellow at the Radiation (Lawrence Livermore) Laboratory, University of Berkeley, California, where he worked with his good friend and future Nobel laureate, Glenn Seaborg, on the production of new isotopes. In 1950 he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a research associate, and in September 1951 he was appointed assistant professor of chemistry at Harvard. It was there that his interest in organometallic chemistry developed and where he did the research which was later to be the main source of his Nobel prize. On 17 July 1952 Wilkinson married Dr Lise S&oslash;lver Schou (<i>b</i>. 1924), a Danish plant physiologist and medical historian, and daughter of Svend Aage Schou, professorial rector of the Pharmaceutical High School, Copenhagen; theirs was a long and happy marriage. They had two daughters, Anne and Pernille. In 1954, with the help of a Guggenheim fellowship, Wilkinson spent a nine-month sabbatical leave at the University of Copenhagen, where he worked in a laboratory in which the necessary upward draught in the fume cupboard was still accomplished by having flaming gas burners at the top. His research necessitated the use of flammable organic solvents and he had several spectacular fires. Despite this he continued pioneering research in the field of organometallic hydride chemistry.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoImperialCollege"></a>Return to Imperial College</h2>In 1955 Wilkinson was appointed professor of inorganic chemistry at Imperial College, taking up his position there in January 1956 at the early age of thirty-four. One of the first things that he did on arrival was to cajole a grant of &pound;20,000&#151;a very large sum in the mid-1950s&#151;from the authorities to purchase a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument, the first such commercial spectrometer in Britain. Sir Alexander Todd, then chairman of the advisory committee on scientific policy, had the remarkable prescience to recommend that the grant should be made, and it was a wise investment for research in Britain. Wilkinson and his students used the machine tirelessly and to very good effect. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1965, received its royal medal in 1981 and its Davy medal in 1996 (in the course of his life he received some fifteen medals and nine honorary degrees). He was knighted in 1976.<br>
<br>In those rather formal days Wilkinson was remarkable in that he dressed casually, adopted some American habits, addressed his students by their first names and expected them, and the departmental staff, to call him Geoff. He was as popular with the cleaners&#151;his office and laboratories needed their particular attention&#151;as with his students and the academic staff. Although he had little interest in administration and really rather despised administrators (&#145;apparatchiks&#146;, he called them) he was, from 1976 to 1988, to everyone's surprise a very effective head of the chemistry department. This he accomplished largely by inspired delegation and having an open-door policy for staff and students alike.<br>
<br>In 1988 Wilkinson became professor emeritus and the college commissioned a striking portrait in oils of him by the artist Keith Grant. In the same year the firm Johnson Matthey plc provided a laboratory for him on the top floor of the chemistry building. There he continued to run a small, creative research group until the day before his death, producing some ten high-quality, innovative research papers a year, an astonishing record for someone who had supposedly retired.<h2>
<a name="Wilkinsonschemistry"></a>Wilkinson's chemistry</h2>Wilkinson's work covered a wide range, but a common factor was that metals played a central role in almost all the compounds which he studied. The radiochemistry of isotopes was the topic of his early research years, from 1943 to 1951; isotopes are forms of an element with the same atomic number (number of protons) but different mass numbers (sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the atom). He amassed during this time a vast knowledge of inorganic chemistry, since radiochemists had to know in great detail the practical chemistry of the transition metals, the lanthanides, and the actinides in order to separate their isotopes. He believed that his greatest contribution in those early days was to measure the rates of formation of the products formed by fission of uranium-235, the material used in the first atomic bomb. With Glenn Seaborg at Berkeley he worked on nuclear taxonomy, the production of neutron deficient isotopes of the transition elements and the lanthanides, using the cyclotrons at the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, and there he made more artificial isotopes than anyone else before or since&#151;no less than eighty-nine. He was particularly proud of his nuclear transmutation of platinum to gold, which caught the public imagination after a report in 1948 in the <span class="italic">San Francisco Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was most famed for his fundamental contributions to organometallic chemistry, the study of compounds containing a direct metal-to-carbon bond. It is fair to say that his work launched modern organometallic chemistry. The realization of the unique sandwich structure of ferrocene (bis-cyclopentadienyliron) by him and Robert B. Woodward at Harvard eventually led to a Nobel prize in 1973, awarded jointly to Wilkinson and Professor E. O. Fischer of the Technische Hochschule, Munich. In ferrocene, so named because of certain similarities with benzene, an iron atom lies between two parallel cyclopentadienyl (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) rings. Although ferrocene had been made before, no one, before this pioneering work, knew or understood its unique structure. Having established the structure of ferrocene, Wilkinson went on to make analogous materials with other metals, and many other novel organometallic compounds, thereby revolutionizing perspectives on the subject. Although he did not investigate their industrial potential, many of the sandwich compounds have remarkable and useful properties, being used now in sensors and as catalysts for olefin polymerization. It was during this period too that he made creative use of the then fledgeling technique of nuclear magnetic resonance. Later he turned to the chemistry of metal alkyls and aryls, and did some remarkable work in this essentially new area&#151;it is typical of him that, in his Nobel speech, he spoke on this rather than on the ferrocene work that gave him his prize.<br>
<br>Although principally remembered as an organometallic chemist, Wilkinson made an enormous contribution to co-ordination chemistry (which, unlike organometallic chemistry, involves compounds containing no metal&#150;carbon bonds). This thread ran through his entire research career, for co-ordination chemistry had a crucial role to play in the separational aspects of his radiochemistry. Outstanding in this area was his work on homogeneous catalysts&#151;materials which in solution accelerate a chemical reaction without themselves being destroyed. His discovery in 1966 of the remarkable complex RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which catalyses addition of hydrogen to organic compounds, was seminal. It became universally known as Wilkinson's catalyst, and both it and its analogues were widely used in chemical and biomedical reactions. About the same time he showed the compound RhH(CO)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> to be a very effective and selective catalyst for the reaction of organic olefins with hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) to give aldehydes. This became a widely used industrial process for converting propylene to <i>n</i>-butyraldehyde, a precursor for plasticizers and many other useful organic compounds. His work on these and other catalysts revolutionized understanding of homogeneous catalysis by transition-metal complexes.<h2>
<a name="Publications"></a>Publications</h2>Wilkinson produced 557 scientific papers on fundamental chemical research, and wrote or edited a number of books still in use many years later. Of these the most internationally influential was <span class="italic">Advanced Inorganic Chemistry: a Comprehensive Text</span> (1962), which he and his ex-student F. Albert Cotton produced. It is no exaggeration to say that this revolutionized the presentation of inorganic chemistry to undergraduates, postgraduates, and chemists everywhere. The book was translated into many languages, much to his irritation in some cases, for he had difficulty in retrieving royalties for some of those translated versions which had been pirated. There was a hilarious correspondence between him and the Soviet authorities on this matter; for some obscure reason the recipient of these letters at the Soviet embassy was the agricultural counsellor, later to be expelled by Sir Alec Douglas-Home as a spy. Wilkinson insisted on sending copies of his letters and the deadpan replies from the agricultural counsellor to all universities and, to its extreme discomfiture, the Foreign Office. Subsequent editions of Cotton and Wilkinson, as it was universally known, were published in 1966, 1972, 1980, and 1988. The sixth edition (with Cotton, Murillo, and Bochmann) was published in 1999; two days before he died Wilkinson handed in his final, typically untidy, manuscript for typing.<br>
<br>Important too for research chemists everywhere were the six-volume <span class="italic">Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry</span> (1987), for which Wilkinson was the chief editor with R. D. Gillard and Jon McCleverty as editors, and the nine-volume <span class="italic">Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry</span> of 1982, revised and reissued in fourteen volumes in 1995, which he edited with F. G. A. Stone and E. W. Abel. He also launched in 1982, with Don Bradley, the successful inorganic chemistry journal <span class="italic">Polyhedron</span>.<h2>
<a name="Thescientistandtheman"></a>The scientist and the man</h2>If ever a chemist lived out E. M. Forster's dictum &#145;only connect&#146;, it was Wilkinson. For over fifty years he made fundamental contributions to nuclear, organometallic, co-ordination, and catalytic chemistry, and much of his brilliance lay in his extraordinary ability to interlink these topics, one fertilizing the other. His obituarist in <span class="italic">The Independent</span> said that &#145;The spirit in his research group was more like that of an urgent gold rush in the West than the scholarly and disciplined calm expected in academia&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 1 Oct 1996). If anything this understates the truth: he expected his students to work as hard as he did&#151;seven days a week or at least six, from early morning to late evening. He was, however, remarkably tolerant of eccentric and individual behaviour, perhaps because he himself showed such traits (for example, he made remarkably ingenious and creative use of expletives). He was an excellent supervisor, communicating his own enthusiasm, but always giving the student the space to develop his or her own ideas. A valuable and all-too-rare aspect of his training of students was to insist that they write scientific papers of their results for publication, which he would then invariably return to them, after ruthless editing and alteration, for rewriting: an iterative process.<br>
<br>Wilkinson's research was always original and he had limitless enthusiasm and energy for new chemistry. His work clearly demonstrated one of his dearest beliefs: that imaginative and curiosity driven exploratory synthesis provides a pivotal approach for the creative development of new science. Although he had some industrial collaboration, his work was never directed towards immediate short-term applications, and he sought (and received) little financial support from industry. One of the keys to his success was his encyclopaedic knowledge of chemistry, and particularly of what was significant in it to his own research. He rapidly assimilated techniques that were new to him, found good experts in these areas, and enthused them to collaborate with him.<br>
<br>It is perhaps significant that in 1978 Wilkinson named his chair at Imperial College the Sir Edward Frankland chair of inorganic chemistry. Frankland (1825&#150;1899) was the second professor at the Royal College of Chemistry, from 1868 to 1885. There are parallels between Wilkinson and Frankland: both came from humble backgrounds, Frankland in Lancashire and Wilkinson from very close to Lancashire. Both were organometallic chemists (Frankland is often called the father of organometallic chemistry); and both were relatively uncharismatic lecturers but gifted experimentalists. Wilkinson was amused later to receive letters addressed not to him but to Sir Edward.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was fiercely protective of British science and research; despite his enormous international standing he insisted on publishing almost all his research papers in British scientific journals. He became the scourge of those responsible for higher education and research in the country: a succession of prime ministers received a flow of letters from him on this and other subjects, as did ministers of education, functionaries in research councils, university vice-chancellors, and others. His work was always original and he had limitless enthusiasm and energy for new chemistry; he wore his fame lightly and was accessible to all.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was of medium height, and had a wiry figure and blue eyes which lit up and sparkled when he recognized a friend or spoke of something close to his heart, such as his beloved Yorkshire. His accent was a curious mixture of his native Yorkshire with a strong hint of the transatlantic twang which derived from his thirteen years in North America. He had a keen sense of the mischievous and, when he felt he was in the right company, would express seemingly outrageous opinions and with delight enthusiastically defend them. Although he had a forceful personality there was a certain shyness and even defensiveness in his nature&#151;he would only with extreme reluctance make after-dinner speeches and rarely attended conferences or gave international lectures. A happy family man, when his children were young and particularly outside term time, he went every weekend with his wife to his house in Sussex, where chemistry was entirely eschewed; he proudly claimed to have planted more than 2000 trees there. He had a great sense of fun, was an excellent raconteur, and had many interests: a favourite pastime was walking on the moors and fells of his native Yorkshire, and he had a keen interest in music.<br>
<br>Some two months before Wilkinson's death an informal dinner was held at Imperial College to celebrate his forty years (1956&#150;96) at the college; more than a hundred people attended from all over the world, and his remarkable memory was evident by his instant recognition of collaborators from the distant past. It was a happy and memorable occasion for all. He died on 26 September 1996 at his home, 14 Passmore Street, London, of coronary thrombosis, and was cremated on 8 October at Putney Vale. He was survived by his wife, Lise, and their two daughters.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Wilkinson's contributions to many areas of chemistry were immense. He was lucky to have been part of what came to be seen as a golden age of chemical research, when pressure to obtain funds was far less insistent than later, and when there was positive encouragement to do what he did so well&#151;research for the sake of it, rather than for material rewards. He was fortunate too to have been associated with the atomic energy project, to which he gave much but from which he also received much in experience and in knowledge. The timing and circumstances of his first and perhaps most fundamental discovery (recognition of the true nature of ferrocene) were a great help, as was being at an institution, Harvard, where the first NMR instrument was sited and where there were so many distinguished chemists. He was fortunate also to have selected such excellent collaborators at Imperial College. Nevertheless, it needed a certain genius to have used this good fortune creatively, to have harnessed it constructively, and to have exercised the remarkable instinct which he had for the new experiment, the new area of research, which would produce really original and creative new science.<br>
