<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chaplin,  Henry</span>, first Viscount Chaplin  (1840&#150;1923), <span class="occ">politician and sportsman</span>, was born on 22 December 1840 at Ryhall, near Stamford, the third child but the eldest surviving son of the Revd Henry Chaplin (1789&#150;1849), vicar of Ryhall, and his wife, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of William Ellice (1781&#150;1822), MP for Great Grimsby in 1807&#150;12, and niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8650/', "Edward Ellice")</script>. The Ellices were a mercantile family, and Edward a leading whig, but the Chaplins were tory country gentlemen, resident in Lincolnshire since the seventeenth century. Tathwell, near Louth, had been inherited from the Hamby family, and the larger Kesteven property, centred on Blankney, near Sleaford, had been purchased in 1719. There were also marriage connections with the nobility. The grandmother of Henry Chaplin, senior, had been a Cecil of Burghley; Ryhall was a Burghley living; and his elder brother Charles, the squire of Blankney, had sat for Lord Exeter's borough of Stamford before becoming MP for Lincolnshire. When the elder Henry died in 1849 his wife and children went to live at Blankney. The Charles Chaplins were childless, and when the squire died in 1856 his young nephew, Henry, still a minor, succeeded to the Lincolnshire estates of some 23,000 acres. He was educated at Harrow School (1854&#150;6) and privately, before spending a few terms as a gentleman commoner at Christ Church, Oxford (1859&#150;60). This was followed by an expedition to the Rocky Mountains, during which Lake Chaplin in Saskatchewan was named after him.<br>
<br>A dedicated rider to hounds from youth, in 1864 Chaplin purchased the Burton pack from Lord Henry Bentinck, his mentor in hunting matters, and from 1865 to 1871 he hunted that extensive country as master. In the latter year it was divided, and Chaplin hunted the Blankney, formerly the southern portion of the Burton, from 1877 to 1881. All this was in the squirearchical tradition, but he was also quick to develop a taste for high society and extravagant living. From Oxford days he was a member of the prince of Wales's circle, and by the mid-1860s he was spending huge sums on racehorses, money that was only temporarily recouped by his success with Hermit at the 1867 Derby. He was said to have won &pound;140,000 on that race, while the fourth marquess of Hastings, with whom Lady Flora Paget, Chaplin's fianc&eacute;e, had bolted in 1864, lost &pound;80,000.<br>
<br>Chaplin was thus already well-known when he entered parliament as member for the newly created county constituency of Mid Lincolnshire in 1868. He made an impression with his maiden speech on Irish disestablishment, and attracted the favourable attention of Disraeli, to whom he had been introduced by Lord Henry Bentinck. In 1875 he was considered for the Irish secretaryship, but was passed over as too inexperienced for that tricky post. An attack on Gladstone's foreign policy during the 1877 session resulted in a well-merited mauling from its intended victim, but on questions relating to land and agriculture Chaplin was on firmer ground. He was a member of the royal commission on agricultural depression (1879&#150;81), and prominent in the counsels of the central chamber of agriculture. As a loyal supporter of the party leadership in the opposition years of 1880&#150;85 he came into conflict with Lord Randolph Churchill, and was narrowly defeated by him in an election for the chairmanship of the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations in 1884. In the following year he achieved office in Lord Salisbury's first ministry as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, with special responsibility for agriculture, but when Salisbury returned to power in 1886 Chaplin declined the Local Government Board because it did not carry a seat in the cabinet.<br>
<br>In 1889, however, it was decided to create a Board of Agriculture, mainly from the agricultural department of the privy council. Chaplin was the obvious choice as its first president, and since the offer came with a seat in the cabinet it was duly accepted. The new department, however, had a small budget and little real scope for assisting the long-suffering agriculturist, though by the time the ministry fell in 1892 Chaplin had secured the passage of a measure to combat cattle disease and a smallholdings bill. In 1895 Salisbury gave him the Local Government Board, but in this post he was a less than conspicuous success, mishandling an agricultural rating bill in 1896 and being thrown over by Arthur Balfour on the <span class="roman">Vaccination Bill</span> of 1898. He was removed from office in 1900.<br>
<br>During the 1890s Chaplin's financial affairs became desperate. Arable estates such as his had been especially badly hit by the depression, and despite his reputation as a model squire he had been an inattentive and only partially resident landlord. In 1897 Blankney passed into the hands of the earl of Londesborough, and the Tathwell estate was sold about 1900. Despite this his local popularity was sufficient to return him for the Sleaford division, which he had held since 1885, at the general election of 1900, but he was ousted in 1906 and forced to retreat to the suburban seat of Wimbledon, which he won in a by-election in 1907, defeating the Hon. Bertrand Russell. A tariff-reformer early in the new century&#151;he represented agriculture on Chamberlain's tariff reform commission&#151;he supported Ulster in 1914 and opposed the wartime coalition in 1915, becoming leader of the token opposition in the Commons. In 1916, having suffered a slight stroke, he was persuaded to retire with the viscountcy that he had previously declined in 1900.<br>
<br>In appearance Chaplin was every inch the squire. Although more striking for his girth than his height in later years, he had an excellent constitution, and retained his agility in the saddle. Horses, indeed, remained a lifelong obsession, and for many years he was an active member of the Jockey Club, of which he was a steward from 1873. He was also very fond of good food and society, and acquired a reputation as a diner-out and raconteur. He remained cheerful despite sadness in his personal life. In 1876 he had married Lady Florence Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16540/', "George Granville William Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, third duke of Sutherland")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16539/', "Gower, George Granville Leveson-")</script>]. She brought him both happiness and stability, but after only five years of marriage she died after the birth of their third child, in 1881. After the loss of Chaplin's own establishment it was his brother-in-law Lord Stafford, later fourth duke of Sutherland, who provided a <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> for him and who largely brought up his children. In 1899 his elder daughter, Edith [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45461/', "Stewart, Edith Helen Vane-Tempest-")</script>], married Lord Castlereagh, later seventh marquess of Londonderry, and near the end of his life Chaplin went to live at Londonderry House, Park Lane, London. He died there on 29 May 1923, and was buried at Blankney.<br>
<br>Politically Chaplin was one of the last of the country-gentleman party. He suffered, perhaps, from being regarded as the personification of that breed, despite the fact that he was abler, harder-working, and considerably grander in his tastes and connections than the average squire. He aspired to be a statesman, although in fact he was by nature more of a follower than a leader. He also lacked the agility of the party manager, and his sub-Disraelian style of oratory, never as effective as he imagined, became increasingly old-fashioned and indeed risible in the post-Disraelian period. Yet in a deeper way he remained true to his origins in the shires. Despite his party loyalty he was at heart a protectionist, and was strongly attracted in turn to fair trade, bimetallism (in the late 1880s), and later tariff reform. It was in the country rather than in parliament that he was most appreciated: Walter Long, another squire turned politician, described him as &#145;one of the most deservedly popular men that ever lived&#146;.<br>
