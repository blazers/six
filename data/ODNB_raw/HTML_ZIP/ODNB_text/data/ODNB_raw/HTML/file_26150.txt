<span class="headword">Spigurnel, Sir  Henry</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1261, <em>d.</em> 1328), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the eldest son of Philip Spigurnel, who held the manor of Dagnall near Edlesborough in Buckinghamshire. The family surname came from a hereditary office in the royal chapel and chancery, and Philip was a younger son either of the Godfrey Spigurnel who died in 1240, or of the Nicholas Spigurnel who succeeded Godfrey in office and in the family lands in Nottinghamshire and Essex, and who died in 1266. Henry had at least one younger brother, Thomas, and possibly a second brother, Simon. Since Henry Spigurnel was old enough to be appointed as an attorney by 1282, he cannot have been born later than 1261. He was active as an attorney in the common bench only between 1282 and 1285, and probably undertook this activity only while attending the court to listen to litigation as part of his legal education. By the autumn of 1285 he is to be found speaking as a serjeant in the Northamptonshire eyre, and surviving reports show him acting as a serjeant in a number of other counties on the northern eyre circuit during 1286 and 1287. His first appearance as a serjeant in the common bench was late in 1287, and he soon became one of the court's most prominent and active serjeants. Between 1292 and 1294 he left the common bench to appear as a serjeant on the southern eyre circuit, but he returned to the court when the eyre circuits were suspended in the summer of 1294.<br>
<br>In October 1295 Spigurnel was appointed a regular assize and gaol delivery justice on a circuit with Robert Retford, covering the south-east midlands and East Anglia. He managed to combine this with a continuing common bench practice as a serjeant, and only ceased acting as a serjeant when he was appointed a justice for the Cambridgeshire and Ely eyre of 1299. The following year he went with the former royal justice William of Brompton to Holland, in connection with the assignment of dower to the king's daughter Elizabeth, countess of Holland and Zealand. Brompton was also among his colleagues on the Cornwall eyre of 1302 where Spigurnel heard crown pleas and took some part in hearing civil pleas. By March 1303 he had become a knight. In 1305 and 1306 he was prominent among the justices appointed to the trailbaston commissions, being one of the &#145;cruel&#146; justices threatened with violence in the &#145;Song of Trailbaston&#146;. Spigurnel had sat on a temporary basis in the court of king's bench in the Hilary and Easter terms of 1301 but became one of its permanent justices only at the very end of Edward I's reign (in Trinity term 1307). He then served in the court almost continuously until 1323, apart from apparently brief overseas embassies for Edward II in 1307, 1311 (to the papal curia), and perhaps 1314, and when serving as one of the justices of the Kent eyre in 1313&#150;14. During the same period he also continued active service as a justice of assize, gaol delivery, and oyer and terminer. After he had retired from the king's bench he was commissioned to head an eyre in the Channel Islands, which took place in the autumn of 1323, and he continued to receive judicial commissions until September 1327.<br>
<br>In or before 1294 Spigurnel married Sara, the daughter and heir of John le Brun, who brought him the Oxfordshire manor of Brize Norton, the Bedfordshire manor of Clapham, and lands at Passenham in Northamptonshire. His home was at Dagnall. In 1297 he received a licence from Bishop Sutton to have a private chapel there, and in 1322 he received permission to assign property to support a chaplain celebrating daily in the chapel. In May 1328 Spigurnel was allowed to delay performing homage to the young Edward III on the grounds that he was too decrepit to travel without danger to his life, and by 26 July 1328 he was dead. His death probably occurred at Dagnall; his heir was his elder son, Thomas. He also had a second son, Master Robert Spigurnel, who was going abroad to study in 1322, 1327, and 1330, and who in 1325 exchanged his living of Keyston in Huntingdonshire for that of Tring in Hertfordshire with Master Robert Inge, a relative of the William Inge who was a contemporary of Robert's father as a serjeant and as a royal justice, and whose connections with Henry Spigurnel went back to the time when they were jointly appointed as attorneys by a number of clients in the 1280s.<br>
