<span class="headword">Overton family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1665&#150;<em>c.</em>1765), <span class="occ">map and print publishers</span>, dominated print publishing in London for a century. <a name="cosubject_20971"></a><span class="headword">John Overton</span>  (1639/40&#150;1713)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of Thomas Overton of Covent Garden, tailor. He was apprenticed to Thomas Gould for eight years on 30 June 1655 and made free of the Stationers' Company on 4 July 1663. When London's leading printseller, Peter Stent, died of the plague in 1665, Overton took over his shop: the White Horse, near Pye Corner. This burned down in the great fire of 1666, but by 1669 Overton was established at the White Horse on Snow Hill, opposite St Sepulchre's Church. He built up the most powerful wholesale printselling business in London by publishing widely saleable prints and buying up and republishing successful plates, such as John Speed's maps. He sold maps, topographical views, portraits, and sets of months or stories from scripture for display. Phrases in his will suggest that he married three times. If so, his &#145;second wife&#146; was a daughter of Benjamin Dunn, and his &#145;last wife&#146;, married in 1677, was Sarah Garrett, sister to a John Garrett (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1665&#150;1722) who was probably the printseller who had a shop in the Royal Exchange. He had seven children, Thomas, <a href="#cosubject_63617">Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <a href="#cosubject_63616">Philip [<i>see below</i>]</a>, James, Anne, Margaret, and Sarah. The eldest, Thomas, had emigrated to America and had not been heard of since 1700. John Overton died in March 1713, and was buried in the church of St Sepulchre on 31 March. He named his second son, Henry, as his executor but left the lease of his house and shop to his unmarried daughter Sarah. Both his portrait (the print of which gives his age as sixty-eight in 1708) and his will give an impression of a stern patriarch but he took great care that all his children should get a share of the small fortune that he had amassed.<br>
<br>The business of printselling was altogether more lucrative for the next generation. <a name="cosubject_63617"></a><span class="headword">Henry [i] Overton</span>  (1675/6&#150;1751)<span class="occ"></span> was the second son of John Overton, whose stock he bought by indenture in 1707, having married Sarah Baker in 1706. He ran the shop at the White Horse until his death, extending the network of provincial contacts that John Overton had perhaps already established. The first auctions of prints held in country towns seem often to have consisted chiefly of prints supplied by Henry Overton. He steadily expanded his range of plates along the lines established by his father, responding rapidly to new fashions and demands&#151;for prints of hunting and horseracing, for instance. Although occasionally involved with prestigious publications such as the prints after Louis Laguerre of the <span class="italic">Battles of the Duke of Marlborough</span> (1717), many of Henry Overton's designs were plagiarized from fine prints published by others. Until the <span class="roman">Copyright Act</span> of 1735 William Hogarth was a notable victim of such piracy. His <span class="italic">Harlot's Progress</span>, for instance, was copied cheaply by their employees in a wide range of sizes at different prices, down to the crudest woodcut royal and pot sheets distributed by rural salesmen. Some of the firm's oldest plates remained valuable: Henry Overton reprinted Wenceslaus Hollar's plates in April 1743. He died at his house in Charterhouse Square on 27 June 1751; his death &#145;in the 76th Year of his Age&#146; was reported next day in the <span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>, which noted that &#145;He was married a few Days since to a young Lady of about Thirty, to whom he has left 10,000 <i>l</i>.&#146; The marriage to Mary Green had taken place on 8 April 1751 at St Michael Cornhill. To his &#145;dear wife Mary&#146; he left his sizeable share in the New River, his freehold house in Charterhouse Square, his house and garden in Middlesex, and &pound;500 bank stock. The lease of his house, shop, and premises and all his copperplates, wood blocks, maps, prints, paper, and other stock went to his nephew <a href="#cosubject_64996">Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He left a house in Ormonde Street and two more off Fetter Lane to his niece Henrietta and further property to his niece Catherine Skynner.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_63616"></a><span class="headword">Philip Overton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1681&#150;1745)<span class="occ"></span> was the third son of John Overton. He was apprenticed to his father in 1695 so it is likely that he was born about 1681. He was made free of the Stationers' Company in 1702. In 1707 his father gave him &pound;200 &#145;toward his advancement and setting up a trade&#146; and lent him two further amounts of &pound;100 in August and October 1711. He had set himself up at the White Horse opposite St Dunstan's Church, Fleet Street, by May 1708 but changed his sign to the Golden Buck by January 1710. Philip Overton's shop set a higher tone than that of Henry Overton. Although the brothers often published in alliance, Philip was involved in the distribution of a number of fine modern prints and helped to publish some, such as William Hogarth's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> set (1726). He also sold imported prints of quality. From 1738 he published a few political satires. Nevertheless, his staple was in interesting and decorative prints for the middle market. Philip Overton's will, signed on 5 February 1745 and proved on 20 February 1745, left his estate to his second wife, <a href="#cosubject_64997">Mary [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He desired to be buried in Aston, Hertfordshire, where he presumably had property. He also had a house in Kentish Town as well as his shop in Fleet Street.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64997"></a><span class="headword">Mary Overton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1745&#150;1748)<span class="occ"></span>, widow and successor of Philip Overton, briefly ran the Golden Buck in Fleet Street after her husband's death in February 1745. On 6 January 1747 she married James Sayer at Christ Church, Spitalfields. It would seem that at about this time James's younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50893/', "Robert Sayer")</script> became her assistant. In the art dealer Arthur Pond's account books there are a number of references to her buying prints from him. The shop was run by Mary until December 1748 when in newspaper advertisements Robert Sayer was first named as manager.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64996"></a><span class="headword">Henry [ii] Overton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1751&#150;1764)<span class="occ"></span>, nephew and successor of Henry [i] Overton, was presumably the son of John Overton's fourth son, James. Taking over the business in 1751 he moved vigorously into the market for engraved views, usually publishing in partnership with Robert Sayer. He maintained the White Horse at Snow Hill until at least November 1764. On 29 February 1752 an announcement appeared in the <span class="italic">London Evening-Post</span>, &#145;On Thursday last Mr. Overton, an eminent Printseller without Newgate, was married to Miss Dawson, of Gilt-Spur Street, an agreeable young Lady with a considerable Fortune.&#146; Sadly, a correction appeared in the next issue to the effect that the announcement had been &#145;premature&#146;. A printed catalogue of his stock of &#145;Common and Fine Prints&#146;, issued in 1754, extended to seventy-nine pages. At that time his latest innovation was wallpaper, designed by John Baptist Jackson, &#145;printed in oil&#146; with special designs &#145;in chiaro oscuro and in chints colours&#146; to have the effect of prints displayed on the wall. He advertised a new edition of George Bickham's <span class="italic">Universal Penman</span> in November 1764 but after that date he disappeared from view.<br>
