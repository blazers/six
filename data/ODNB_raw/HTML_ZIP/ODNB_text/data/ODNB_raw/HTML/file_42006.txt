<span class="headword">Lyttelton,  Alfred</span>  (1857&#150;1913), <span class="occ">sportsman and politician</span>, was born on 7 February 1857 at Hagley Hall, Worcestershire. He was the eighth son and youngest of the twelve children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17307/', "George William Lyttelton, fourth Baron Lyttelton (1817&#150;1876)")</script>, and his wife, Mary Glynne (1813&#150;1857) (W. E. Gladstone's sister-in-law). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34655/', "Arthur Temple Lyttelton")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34656/', "Edward Lyttelton")</script> were his brothers. His mother, exhausted by child bearing, died six months after his birth. Despite this and his father's melancholia, Alfred Lyttelton had a serene and sunny disposition that was noticed by all. Brought up in a sporting and especially a cricketing family (which could field an eleven composed only of Lytteltons), he went to a preparatory school in Brighton and then to Eton College (Evans's house) in January 1868, where he was tutored by W. Johnson Cory, who encouraged him to study history. At Eton he was known as a supreme all-round sportsman. Curzon, his friend there, later wrote that &#145;no athlete was ever quite such an athlete, and no boyish hero was ever quite such a hero as was Alfred Lyttelton&#146;. The rest of his life, Lyttelton felt, was to an extent an anticlimax. In 1875 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was an Apostle as well as the leading cricketer of his day. He was disappointed with a second class in history, but played cricket for Cambridge from 1876 until 1879, when he captained an undefeated team. He took up royal tennis at Cambridge, and held the amateur championship from 1882 until 1896, while continuing to play cricket. With little family money available, he was called to the bar in 1881 and made a steady income. From 1882 to 1885 he was legal private secretary to Sir Henry James, the attorney-general. He resisted Gladstone's attempts&#151;intense after 1886&#151;to persuade him to stand as a Liberal, preferring instead the social life of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42005', "Souls")</script>, though he was untainted by their decadence. In that context he met <a href="#cosubject_42006">(Octavia) Laura Tennant [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he married in May 1885. She died following childbirth eleven months later, leaving a son who died from tubercular meningitis in 1888. Their romance and her early death added to Alfred Lyttelton's reputation as a man apart. On 18 April 1892 he married Edith Sophy Balfour [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51800/', "Lyttelton, Dame Edith Sophy (1865&#150;1948)")</script>], also a Soul and daughter of Archibald Balfour, a London businessman. They had two sons and a daughter, one of the sons dying in infancy. The surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31385/', "Oliver Lyttelton")</script>, was a member of Churchill's war cabinet. Her memoir of her husband shows a dispassionate and shrewd mind.<br>
<br>Unwilling to buck the family tradition during Gladstone's political lifetime, Lyttelton waited until 1894 overtly to declare his Liberal Unionism. He was Liberal Unionist MP for Warwick and Leamington from 1895 to 1906. He also increased his standing at the bar, being recorder of Hereford, 1893&#150;4, and of Oxford, 1894&#150;1903, and taking silk in 1900. In that year Joseph Chamberlain rather surprisingly sent him to South Africa as chairman of the Transvaal concessions commission to plan post-war reconstruction, his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34657/', "Neville Lyttelton")</script> becoming commander-in-chief at almost the same time. Alfred Lyttelton impressed Milner, who suggested to Chamberlain that he should succeed him as high commissioner.<br>
<br>On Chamberlain's resignation in September 1903, Lyttelton was appointed colonial secretary, a dramatic elevation and one for which he felt himself unprepared and unsuited. He accepted, against the advice of his officials, demands from Milner and the mine owners for indentured labour to solve the labour shortage in South Africa; the Chinese Labour Ordinance of 12 March 1904 led to the outcry over &#145;Chinese slavery&#146; and 50,000 Chinese on the Rand, an important factor in the 1906 election, though the Liberals, once in office, were unable immediately to cancel the ordinance. He also, by letters patent of 31 March 1905, granted representative government to the Transvaal, a constitution abrogated by his Liberal successor on 8 February 1906. In April 1905 Lyttelton sent a dispatch advocating what he hoped would become a permanent &#145;imperial council&#146;; the Unionist government fell before this body met and the Liberals used the traditional term &#145;colonial conference&#146;, and abandoned Lyttelton's proposal for a permanent secretariat. As in all his major initiatives as colonial secretary, Lyttelton acted against the advice of his officials.<br>
<br>Lyttelton lost his seat in the 1906 general election, but was unopposed for St George's, Hanover Square, at a by-election in June 1906. He held the seat easily in 1910. He did not return to the bar but was a director of the London and Westminster Bank and other companies. He opposed Welsh disestablishment, advocated housing and town-planning reform, and supported women's suffrage and the government's <span class="roman">Trade Boards Bill</span> to improve conditions in sweated industries. He was an active supporter of the university settlement movement.<br>
<br>In 1913 Lyttelton and his family took a holiday in east Africa, but he was unable to throw off lassitude, though continuing his duties. While scoring 89 in a cricket match at Bethnal Green he was struck in the stomach and developed an abscess, from which he died on 5 July 1913 at 3 Devonshire Terrace, London, a nursing home. He was buried in Hagley churchyard. The Oxford&#150;Cambridge cricket match was briefly stopped to mark his passing and H. H. Asquith gave a memorable tribute to the Commons on 8 July. If Lyttelton's pre-eminence was that of the cricketer, his colonial secretaryship was bolder and more coherent in its imperial objectives&#151;unpopular though they were&#151;than might have been expected from one often regarded as a charming, Corinthian dilettante. Like a hero in a Buchan novel, he touched a nerve in his contemporaries, prompting Asquith, his political opponent, to say of him that &#145;he, perhaps of all men of this generation, came nearest to the mould and ideal of manhood, which every English father would like to see his son aspire to, and if possible to attain&#146;.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_42006"></a><span class="headword">(Octavia) Laura Lyttelton</span>  (1862&#150;1886) was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36455/', "Sir Charles Tennant")</script> and his first wife, Emma Winsloe. She was a prominent Soul and led an emancipated, flirtatious life, smoothly moving from the manufacturing background of her family into the odd mixture of liberation and snobbery which constituted the Souls. Adolphus Liddell and Gerald Balfour were two of her conquests. She seems to have selected Alfred Lyttelton in a search for stability and security. She was ambivalent about her engagement (&#145;the fact is marriage is a lower form of life&#151;a happier, I am sure, but a more egotistical&#146;; Jalland, 108) but successfully projected with her husband the image of a perfect couple. Her early death, on 24 April 1886, eight days after childbirth and possibly weakened by tuberculosis, shocked society and created an enduring legend.<br>
