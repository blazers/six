<span class="headword">Stuart,  John  Crichton-</span>, sixth marquess of Bute  (1933&#150;1993), <span class="occ">benefactor and patron of the arts</span>, was born at 10 Charles Street, Mayfair, London, at 9.50 a.m. on 27 February 1933, fifteen minutes before his twin brother, David; they were the two eldest among the four children of John Crichton-Stuart, fifth marquess of Bute (1907&#150;1956), and his wife, Lady Eileen Beatrice Forbes (1912&#150;1993), younger daughter of Bernard Arthur William Patrick Hastings Forbes, eighth earl of Granard. As a member of a prominent Roman Catholic family, Lord Cardiff, as John was known before becoming earl of Dumfries on the death of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76348/', "John Crichton Stuart")</script>, the fourth marquess, in 1947, was educated at Ampleforth College. After national service in the Scots Guards he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read history and attended the Slade lectures in art history given by Nikolaus Pevsner. He succeeded to the marquessate on the death of his father in 1956 and was immediately faced with a heavy burden of death duties. One consequence of this was the sale of family property in Cardiff to the corporation and, in 1969, the transfer of the Robert Adam houses bought by his grandfather on the north side of Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, to the National Trust for Scotland: 6 Charlotte Square became the official residence of the secretary of state for Scotland.<br>
<br>In addition to serving on Bute county council and as lord lieutenant of Bute and, subsequently, of Argyll and Bute, and chairing several charities&#151;all &#145;tasks befitting his station, rather than his character&#146;  (Drummond, 23)&#151;John Bute contributed much to the artistic life of Scotland and towards preserving its artistic treasures. He did so first as chairman and then vice-president and president of the National Trust for Scotland after 1969, as a trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland (1980&#150;87), and as chairman of the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland (1983&#150;8). In all these and other roles he commanded respect by his assured mastery of the business in hand. Tam Dalyell observed that<blockquote>In the second half of the century, when the notion of public service is somehow going out of fashion, Bute was one of the aristocrats who stuck to the age-old tradition whereby those who inherited wealth believed that privilege brought with it responsibilities to the nation or local community. (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 July 1993)</blockquote>Like his grandfather and his great-grandfather the third marquess, whom he resembled physically as well as in a certain dandyism in dress, Bute achieved much by stealth and through influence: &#145;If criticism were to be levelled, it would have to be that he played his cards very close to his chest, and did not always inform his committee members of the options before they were presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 July 1993). Conscious of his position and of his predecessors' work in both commissioning new architecture and in preserving historic buildings, he was unable himself to build on such a scale, although he loved architecture; nevertheless, he was able to patronize modern design in enterprises he supported, notably the Dovecot Studios of the Edinburgh Tapestry Company. This concern was also evident in the livery of his estates on Bute, in which he took a close and constructive interest, and in the industries he promoted on the island to attempt to stem the haemorrhage of its population. In 1992 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Although assured in his many public roles, Bute was withdrawn and essentially shy in private. In middle age he seemed melancholy and lonely, especially after the premature death of his twin brother and that of his beloved daughter Caroline in a road accident in 1984. He had married (Beatrice) Nicola Grace Weld-Forester (<i>b</i>. 1933), only daughter of Lieutenant-Commander W. B. C. Weld-Forester RN, on 19 April 1955 but this ended in divorce in 1977. On 12 November in the following year he married Jennifer Home-Rigg (<i>b</i>. 1933), a wine merchant, the former wife of Gerald Percy and the daughter of J. B. Home-Rigg of Plaston, South Africa, who brought him much happiness and encouraged him to restore and enhance Mount Stuart, the vast and lugubrious Gothic revival house on Bute designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson for his great-grandfather.<br>
<br>John Bute's last important contribution to the artistic life of Scotland was to chair the trustees of the National Museums of Scotland after 1985. In this role he was the guiding force behind the commissioning of the new building for the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh; when the prince of Wales attempted to undermine the architectural competition because he disliked the winning design (by Benson and Forsyth), Bute ensured that the project proceeded regardless. At the laying of the foundation-stone in April 1993 Bute gave an &#145;excellent oration&#146; despite being by then disfigured by cancer of the throat. Tam Dalyell recalled how, &#145;conversing with everybody afterwards, there was not a trace of self-pity. It was a courageous and supremely dignified curtain call&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 July 1993). Bute died at Mount Stuart on 21 July 1993 and was buried at Shore Chapel there. His eldest son, John Colum Crichton-Stuart (<i>b</i>. 1958), succeeded to the marquessate.<br>
