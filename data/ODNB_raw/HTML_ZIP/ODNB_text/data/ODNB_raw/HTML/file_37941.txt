<span class="headword">Scott,  Geoffrey</span>  (1884&#150;1929), <span class="occ">writer and architect</span>, was born on 15 June 1884 in Hampstead, London, the fourth son and the youngest of seven children of Russell Scott (1837&#150;1908) and his wife, Jessie Thurburn (1844&#150;1921); he was the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35980/', "Charles Prestwich Scott")</script>, the distinguished editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. His father was a flooring manufacturer whose success in business, along with family money, allowed him to provide a comfortable home for his wife and family. Scott spent his early childhood at home in Hampstead and attended local schools, including (for a year) the Highgate School. In 1898, he matriculated at Rugby School. There he distinguished himself among his classmates as someone who was interested in aesthetics. Success at Rugby led to New College, Oxford, which he entered in the autumn of 1902 after spending a year at St Andrews. He studied under the eminent classicist Gilbert Murray and gained some recognition by winning the Newdigate prize in 1906 and the chancellor's essay prize in 1908. The latter, entitled <span class="italic">The National Character of English Architecture</span> (1908), provided the groundwork for his later work, <span class="italic">The Architecture of Humanism</span>.<br>
<br>Scott's life changed in March 1906 when, accompanied by John Maynard Keynes, he visited the Villa I Tatti, the home outside Florence of the art connoisseurs Bernard and Mary Berenson. Scott quickly developed an intense relationship with Mary, nineteen years his senior, writing to her about his great enthusiasm for classicism and revealing to her the most intimate details of his life at Oxford, including his homosexual relationships. Mary fell in love with Scott and willingly supported him emotionally and even financially. She helped him at the beginning of his career when, having achieved only a second in Greats, he was unable to proceed with his plans to become a classical scholar. In 1907 she introduced him to the young architect <a href="#cosubject_60836">Cecil Pinsent [<i>see below</i>]</a>; after Scott worked with the American interior designer Ogden Codman on his uncompleted <i>catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i> of French ch&acirc;teaux, Scott and Pinsent formed an architectural partnership in Florence. Scott's interest in and knowledge of architecture had begun at an early age, under his father's influence, and had developed during his extensive travels and study in Italy, especially with the Berensons. Scott had little formal architectural training, apart from a few months in 1907&#150;8 at the Architectural Association School in London.<br>
<br>The first to commission Scott and Pinsent were the Berensons, who asked them to renovate the interior of the Villa I Tatti and to design its gardens. Soon their work was in demand among the many rich Anglo-Americans in Florence. Their first major project, completed in 1913, was the Villa Le Balze in Fiesole, designed in a Renaissance style for John D. Rockefeller's son-in-law, the American philosopher Charles Augustus Strong. At the same time he was designing buildings and gardens Scott was writing his architectural <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Architecture of Humanism</span>, published in August 1914. The book is often cited as one of the most important treatises on architecture of the twentieth century. A defence of Renaissance architecture as a standard for all architecture, Scott's book is also an attack on the many styles that had emerged during the nineteenth century. Beautifully constructed and original in many respects, it depends on previous work by Berenson, Vernon Lee, Adolf von Hildebrand, and Theodor Lipp.<br>
<br>Scott's emotional life before the First World War was as tumultuous and ill-defined as his career. After affairs with a number of women, Scott married Lady Sybil Marjorie Cutting (1879&#150;1943) on 23 April 1918. Lady Sybil, the daughter of Hamilton Cuffe, fifth earl of Desart, was the rich Anglo-Irish widow of the American diplomat William Bayard Cutting and the mother of the historian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63089/', "Iris Origo")</script>. The marriage precipitated a rupture with Mary Berenson, who, as a result, had a nervous breakdown, and led to tension in his friendship with Edith Wharton. Scott himself was forced to spend the summer and autumn of 1919 in Lausanne under the care of the well-known psychologist Dr Roger Vittoz.<br>
<br>It was during this time in Switzerland that Scott began his biography of the eighteenth-century novelist Madame de Charri&egrave;re. <span class="italic">The Portrait of Z&eacute;lide</span> was his most celebrated book: considered by many to be among the most beautifully written of twentieth-century biographies, it reflects the influence of Lytton Strachey in its brevity and its appeal to a general reader. Because of his difficult home life, he took five years to complete this short biography. For several years after the war he also worked in the British embassy in Rome as the head of its press office. With the beginning of a most complicated love affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35903/', "Vita Sackville-West (1892&#150;1962)")</script> in October of 1923, which was as much a literary friendship as an emotional involvement, Scott was able to finish his book. It was published to much critical acclaim in 1924. When it won the James Tait Black memorial prize in 1926, Scott's reputation as a writer was firmly established.<br>
<br>The relationship with Vita Sackville-West precipitated Scott's divorce from Lady Sybil in 1926; she later married the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34619/', "Percy Lubbock")</script>. Now Scott began his work for the American businessman Colonel Ralph Isham who had recently bought the Boswell papers, probably the most important literary discovery of the century, from Boswell's descendants. Scott went to America in October 1927 as the first editor of the Boswell papers and spent almost two years on Long Island working on them. He died suddenly of pneumonia on 14 August 1929 at the Rockefeller Institute, New York, after the publication of the first six volumes to much acclaim and the signing of a very lucrative contract with Houghton Mifflin to write a full-length biography of Boswell. His ashes were brought back to New College, Oxford, in the same year.<br>
<br>Scott was a polymath whose interests extended beyond his success as a biographer, aesthetician, architect, and editor. He wrote poetry, magazine articles, and book reviews, did numerous caricatures and some interior design (including a bed which is now at the Victoria and Albert Museum). His brilliant mind and superb classical education allowed him to excel in a variety of fields. He was, moreover, sought out by many for his conviviality: Mary Berenson, Edith Wharton, Gerald Wellesley (the future duke of Wellington), any number of other literary and artistic figures, American plutocrats, and European aristocrats all found him to be a delightful companion. He was known not only for his witty conversation and erudition but also for his temperamental behaviour and his snobbery. Today, Scott's work is remembered by a small group of serious readers who admire the elegance of <span class="italic">The Architecture of Humanism</span>, <span class="italic">The Portrait of Z&eacute;lide</span>, his edition of the Boswell papers, and his unpublished letters.<br>
<br>Scott's architectural partner, <a name="cosubject_60836"></a><span class="headword">Cecil Pinsent</span>  (1884&#150;1963), was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 5 May 1884, the son of Adolphus Ross Pinsent (1851&#150;1929), a businessman, and his wife, Alice Nuttall (1855&#150;1901). Educated at Marlborough College (1897&#150;1900), the Architectural Association School (1901&#150;5) and the Royal Academy School of Architecture (1905&#150;6), he began his career in England, but spent most of his life in Italy, especially in Tuscany, designing gardens and villas in the Renaissance style. Among his most important works, apart from the Villa I Tatti and the Villa Le Balze, are the gardens at La Foce, Chianciano, Siena (1924&#150;36), for Antonio and Iris Origo, the Villa Gli Scafari, at Lerice (1932), for Lady Sybil and Percy Lubbock, the Villa Colletti-Perucca at Castiglioncello (1932), for Mrs Colletti-Perucca, and the Villa Le Sabine for Count Niccolo Antinori, at Bolgheri, Leghorn (1935). He died in Hilterfingen, Thunersee, Switzerland, on 5 December 1963, and was buried there.<br>
