<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fryer,  Alfred</span>  (1826&#150;1912), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at Chatteris in the Cambridgeshire fens on 25 December 1826, probably at 87 Park Street, the younger son and at least fifth child of Daniel Fryer (<i>d</i>. after 1861), a gentleman farmer and later also partner in a brewery, and Elizabeth Fortescue (<i>d</i>. after 1861), of Leighton, Huntingdonshire. Sent to a boarding-school at Billesdon, near Leicester, he formed a close friendship with Henry Walter Bates, who shared his fondness for poetry and natural history. However, Fryer could not be persuaded to join Bates and another Leicester friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, when those two left for the Amazon in 1848; by then Fryer's literary tastes were (temporarily) dominant and he was also married, on 1 January 1848, to Sally Negus Rose (<i>d</i>. 1850).<br>
<br>In the town reading-room at Chatteris, Fryer had come across Coventry Patmore's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1844). He sought Patmore out at the British Museum, and won his friendship (and subsequently that of the Rossettis and other figures on the London artistic scene). Whether these connections were the product of periodic visits to London or a period of residence there is unclear: however, it was in Chatteris that his wife gave birth in the spring of 1849, and he was doubtless tied to Chatteris more firmly when the child was left motherless a year later. He married for a second time, probably in 1858; his wife was Clara (1829/30&#150;1899), and they had a family of six children.<br>
<br>Led to expect a substantial inheritance from an aunt, Fryer had been encouraged by his father to follow his interests and not trouble to train for a profession. Indeed, that aunt had already settled on him the freehold of 4 Wood Street in Chatteris and there he made his home for the rest of his life. About this time Fryer began to abandon his literary ambitions and return to studies in natural history. His initial interests in birds, molluscs, and lepidoptera were gradually replaced by a preoccupation with the local flora, resulting in his sending many records to the region's foremost botanist, C. C. Babington (1808&#150;1895), at Cambridge. However, the list of Huntingdonshire plants he contributed to the <span class="italic">Journal of Botany, British and Foreign</span> in 1884 never grew into the book-length flora of that county that was for a time in prospect. This was because he had been diverted into studying, from 1880 onwards, the perplexing array of broad-leaved representatives of the pondweed genus <i>Potamogeton</i> which occurred in exceptional diversity in the waterways within walking distance of his home.<br>
<br>
<i>Potamogetons</i> are subject to much confusing modification by subtle environmental differences and until then had defied satisfactory classification. Fryer was uniquely well placed to follow their growth over several seasons and observe their response to changing water-levels, and he supplemented prolonged fieldwork with cultivation experiments in his garden. As a result he proved that several named entities were merely impermanent growth states. After nine years he also reluctantly came to the then novel conclusion that hybrids occur in this genus, some of them even fully fertile (though, regrettably, neither he nor anyone since has proved this by synthesizing them artificially). A keen student of Darwin's work, Fryer was readier to accept this degree of plasticity in a plant group than most botanical contemporaries; unfortunately, though, his concept of a species was very narrow and almost all of the twelve new ones he described are now disregarded, subsumed within broader entities which bear prior names or else considered hybrids.<br>
<br>In 1898, a year after he was elected an associate of the Linnean Society, Fryer's definitive monograph, <span class="italic">The Potamogetons (Pond Weeds) of the British Isles</span>, began to appear in monthly parts. After two years, however, while the work was still only half-way, friction with the publisher caused him to break off and it was not until 1913&#150;15, after his death, that it was taken to completion by other hands, without the benefit of his own profound knowledge of the group.<br>
<br>Though Fryer was invincibly buoyant and cheerful by nature, a deeper reason for that disengagement was probably the acute financial straits to which he had been unexpectedly reduced. He was bequeathed nothing by his father in the belief that the aunt would provide for him, but on her death in 1885 she proved to have left her money elsewhere. Unwilling to forfeit his independence, Fryer subsisted thereafter on the little that selling the produce of his large garden, with its five glasshouses, brought in. Luckily, his physique was equal to the hard physical labour this involved: until late in life he thought nothing of walking 12 miles to see a cricket match, standing all day, and then walking the 12 miles home again, with one ginger beer as his only sustenance. Even so the struggle for a livelihood could not help but be a distraction and, with a view to moving the monograph forward, a small grant from the Royal Society was obtained for him. Eventually, in 1909, he gave in to repeated attempts by friends to induce him to seek support from a charity, but he only lived to enjoy the resulting small pension for three years: he died on 26 February 1912 from heart failure following what was probably his first illness, an attack of influenza. He was buried in Doddington, the next village, next to his second wife. He had outlived his second wife by about thirteen years and their six children had long since moved to other parts of England, leaving him to live latterly quite alone.<br>
<br>Fryer's large herbarium, mainly of pondweed specimens, superlatively prepared and impeccably documented, was posthumously divided between the British Museum (Natural History), Cambridge University, and Owens College, Manchester. <i>Potamogeton fryeri</i>, an oriental species, was named in his honour by a fellow specialist in the genus, Arthur Bennett.<br>
