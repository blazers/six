<span class="headword">Simson,  William</span>  (1798/9&#150;1847), <span class="occ">painter</span>, second son of Alexander Simson, merchant, was born in Dundee. His father was admitted a burgess of Dundee in 1792, and, though engaged in commerce, was deeply interested in art. Three of his sons became artists: George (1791&#150;1862), a portrait and landscape painter, who became a member of the Royal Scottish Academy; William, the subject of this entry; and David (1803&#150;1874), a successful landscape painter and lithographer. William Simson began his art education in 1818 under the landscape painter Andrew Wilson (1780&#150;1848), master of the Trustees' Academy at Edinburgh. Among his fellow students were Robert Scott Lauder and David Octavius Hill. Simson began exhibiting at the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland in 1821; in 1825 he signed a proposal for the establishment of the Scottish Academy, becoming one of its first academicians. Simson, however, withdrew his membership of the newly established body before the Scottish Academy's first exhibition. It was not until after the union between the institution and the Scottish Academy in 1829 that Simson first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1831. He presented the haunting <span class="italic">Solway Moss&#151;Evening</span> (1830) as his diploma piece.<br>
<br>Simson's early works were local landscapes and seapieces. However, Simson also painted a number of works in response to a visit to the Low Countries in 1827: <span class="italic">A Scene in Holland</span> (1828; NG Scot.) and <span class="italic">Passage Boats Becalmed on the Maas at Dort</span> (NG Scot.) are full of serene light and capture the still, flat countryside and waterways, and reflect the influence of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters Albert Cuyp and William van de Velde II. The success of his elder brother George as a portrait painter encouraged Simson to follow temporarily that branch of art. The Royal Scottish Academy owns two of his cabinet portraits: one of Edmund Thornton Crawford (1806&#150;1885), a contemporary marine painter also influenced by the Dutch school, and the other a portrait of the artist's brother David Simson. These portraits are very finely painted with small, tight brushstrokes and great attention to detail. In 1830 he exhibited his <span class="italic">Shooting Party Regaling</span>&#151;chiefly comprising portraits&#151;at the Royal Academy in London, and from that time until the year of his death (with the exception of 1833, 1835, and 1836) he was a regular exhibitor there. He also sent seventy-two pictures to the exhibitions of the Royal Scottish Academy.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1830s Simson closely followed in David Wilkie's footsteps, imitating his Italian journey in 1834. His work there led to his composition <span class="italic">Cimabue and Giotto</span>, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1838 and purchased by Sir Robert Peel for 150 guineas. Simson moved to London in 1838, and settled at 97 Dean Street, Soho, afterwards moving to 12 Sloane Street, Chelsea. Wilkie did much to encourage Scottish artists to move south but this was to prove Simson's undoing as he forsook landscape painting for history paintings, for example <span class="italic">Columbus at the Door of the Convent of La Rabida</span> (exh. RA, 1839). Simson's genre pieces, for example <span class="italic">A Goatherd's Cottage</span> (1832; NG Scot.) and <span class="italic">Interior of a Cottage, Killin</span> (1833; NG Scot.), are also indebted to Wilkie in composition, colouring, and chiaroscuro. Simson even copied Wilkie's paintings, including <span class="italic">The Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Gazette of the Battle of Waterloo</span>. Such paintings did not meet with critical approval, as Simson did not have the ability to paint interesting and lively historical scenes.<br>
<br>After 1830 Simson's best work is to be found in his drawings and depictions of hunting scenes. The sportsman William Scrope (1772&#150;1852) employed Simson to record events in the field, including <span class="italic">The End of the Day: William Scrope on a White Pony with his Keepers and the Day's Bag</span> (1840s; priv. coll.). Scrope and Simson may have met at the British Institution, where Scrope was the director and Simson exhibited regularly. Simson died at his home, 12 Sloane Street, Chelsea, London, on 29 August 1847, aged forty-eight, having never enjoyed good health. Posthumously his brother David reproduced some of his drawings as lithographs. An album of 205 drawings dating from 1828 to 1847 in the Royal Scottish Academy comprises portrait and animal studies as well as landscapes and seascapes of such diverse locations as Antwerp, Amsterdam, Bridlington, and Dumfries. Collections of Simson's drawings are also in the City of Edinburgh Library Fine Art Department and the National Gallery of Scotland.<br>
