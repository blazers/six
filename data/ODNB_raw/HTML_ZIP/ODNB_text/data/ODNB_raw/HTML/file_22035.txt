<span class="headword">Petheram,  John</span>  (1807&#150;1858), <span class="occ">antiquary and publisher</span>, was born at Oldmixon, near Weston-super-Mare, on 11 May 1807, the eldest in a family of four boys and three girls; his parents were Wesleyan Methodists. In 1830&#150;31 he travelled to America with his family, who settled in New York state. From 1831 to 1834 he was a clerk with Brown, Roper &amp; Co., Falcon Square, Aldersgate, London, in the wholesale drug trade. From July 1834 to autumn 1835 he spent some time in New York and travelling in the United States, supporting himself partly by trading in antiquarian books. An intermittent diary from his twenties shows him devoted to self-improvement and industrious reading at the London Institution (which he had joined in 1831), to collecting historical books for resale, and to preparing bibliographical compilations on English history.<br>
<br>Petheram returned to the druggists' warehouse in London but left it in 1839 to work for Edward Lumley of 56 Chancery Lane, remainder and second-hand bookseller, for whose catalogues he wrote discursive bibliographical articles. By the autumn of 1841 he had set up shop in his own premises at 71 Chancery Lane, and by 1848 had moved to 48 High Holborn. From these addresses he issued 207 catalogues and published several historical works. These included reprints (1843&#150;7), with his own introductions and notes, of seven of the Elizabethan Marprelate tracts, intended as part of a longer series of &#145;puritan discipline tracts&#146;. In 1853&#150;4 he added five parts of a <span class="italic">Bibliographical Miscellany</span> to his catalogues, and he had earlier compiled a competent <span class="italic">Historical Sketch of the Progress and Present State of Anglo-Saxon Literature in England</span> (1840).<br>
<br>Petheram married Elizabeth Bickham, of Sherborne, Dorset, and they had six children, the eldest of whom was only fourteen when Petheram died on 18 December 1858 at 94 High Holborn, &#145;harassed in mind as well as body&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, 24 Feb 1859), suffering from typhus fever and pulmonary disease. Sales of his general books took place on 18 February 1859, and his extensive stock of old music books on 28 March, both dispersals handled by Southgate and Barrett. There seems to have been little left over to support his young family.<br>
