<span class="headword">Sargant,  Ethel</span>  (1863&#150;1918), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born at 45 Regent's Park Road, London, on 28 October 1863, the third daughter in the family of three daughters and three sons of Henry Sargant, barrister and conveyancer of Lincoln's Inn, and his wife, Catherine Emma (<i>d</i>. 1912), daughter of Samuel Beale, MP for Derby. One of her brothers was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35946/', "Sir Charles Henry Sargant")</script>. She was educated at North London Collegiate School and, from 1881, at Girton College, Cambridge. She obtained a second class in part one of the natural sciences tripos (1884) and a third class in part two (1885).<br>
<br>Ethel Sargant spent one year (1892&#150;3) at the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew Gardens, studying under D. H. Scott. There she gained valuable training in research methods, especially in plant anatomy. From 1893 onwards she worked at home, first in a laboratory built in the grounds of her mother's house in Reigate, and later at her home in Girton village, Cambridge. For some years she took care of her mother and an invalid sister. From time to time she acted as research adviser to the Cambridge students who came to her laboratory for instruction. She was elected to an honorary fellowship of Girton College in 1913. Ethel Sargant carried out research in two separate areas&#151;cytology and anatomical morphology. Her earliest work in cytology concerned the presence of centrosomes in higher plants; she then moved to a general study of o&ouml;genesis and spermatogenesis in <i>Lilium martagon</i>. Her most important results, demonstrating the existence of the synaptic phase in living cells, were published in the <span class="italic">Annals of Botany</span> in 1896 and 1897.<br>
<br>Constant use of the high power microscope proved a strain on Sargant's eyes, and this was part of the reason that she began to concentrate on anatomical and phylogenetic questions. Her best-known work concerned the anatomy of seedlings. Her theory of the origin of monocotyledons, put forward in 1903, was based on her extensive investigations of the anatomical structure of very young monocotyledonous seedlings. She offered a new interpretation of the relationship between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, suggesting that both had evolved from a common ancestral stock, and that the single seed-leaf in the monocotyledon was homologous to the pair in the dicotyledon. The implications of these findings were discussed in three major papers published between 1903 and 1908.<br>
<br>Ethel Sargant was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1904, and was the first woman to serve on its council. At the 1913 Birmingham meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science she was elected president of section K (botany), thus becoming the first woman ever to preside over a section. Though primarily a research botanist, she gave a course on the ancestry of the angiosperms at the University of London in 1907. She published over twenty papers. All her writings are characterized by an outstanding clarity and vigour of presentation, a reflection of her keen interest in English literature. As president of the Federation of University Women she gave much time near the end of her life to compiling the register of university women for war work. She died, unmarried, on 16 January 1918 at 4 Clifton Place, Sidmouth, Devon, after a short illness, and was buried at Sidmouth.<br>
