<span class="headword">Skinner, Sir  Matthew</span>  (1689&#150;1749), <span class="occ">serjeant-at-law</span>, was born on 22 October 1689, son of Robert Skinner (1655&#150;1698) of Welton, Northamptonshire, judge of the Marshalsea court, and his wife, Anne, eldest daughter of William Buckby, serjeant-at-law and recorder of Daventry, Northamptonshire. He was the great-grandson of Robert Skinner, bishop of Oxford, sent to the Tower during the civil war. Skinner was educated at Westminster School, where he was a queen's scholar, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 18 June 1709. He entered Lincoln's Inn on 20 June 1709, and became a barrister on 21 April 1716, joining the Oxford circuit. In 1719 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Whitfield of Watford Place, Hertfordshire. They had four sons, only one of whom survived him.<br>
<br>In 1719 Skinner bought the position of one of the four common pleaders of the city of London, thus gaining the right to practise in the lord mayor's court, but he gave this up in 1722 and moved to Oxford, where he had been elected recorder on 30 May 1721, a position he kept until his death. His practice grew rapidly, and he was created serjeant-at-law on 1 February 1724, king's serjeant in 1735, and was first serjeant from 1738. He was knighted in 1735. He served as treasurer of Serjeants' Inn in Chancery Lane, London, from 1737.<br>
<br>Skinner contested Andover unsuccessfully in the parliamentary election in 1727, but was elected MP for Oxford in 1734, with the support of the earl of Abingdon. He sat until 26 November 1738, when he was appointed chief justice of Chester and of the great sessions for the counties of Flint, Denbigh, and Montgomery. He was a counsel for the crown in the trials of the Jacobite rebels on the northern circuit in July 1746, and led for the crown in the trial of the Jacobite Arthur Elphinstone, sixth Baron Balmerino, captured at Culloden, for high treason in the House of Lords later that month.<br>
<br>In 1728 Skinner published his father's <span class="italic">Reports of cases &hellip; from the thirty-third year of &hellip; Charles the Second, to the ninth year of &hellip; William the Third, in the king's bench</span>. He died in Oxford on 21 October 1749 and was buried in Oxford Cathedral.<br>
