<span class="headword">Vannes,  Peter</span>  (<em>c.</em>1488&#150;1563), <span class="occ">diplomat and dean of Salisbury</span>, was born in Lucca, Italy, the son of Stefano Vanni of Lucca. Vannes was the kinsman of Andrea Ammonius, a close friend of Erasmus, Latin secretary to Henry VIII, and one of the many Italian humanists who enjoyed favour at the English court. Vannes referred to himself as Ammonius's kinsman (<i>consobrinus</i>), but their exact relationship has not been established, with some sources suggesting that Ammonius was Vannes's maternal uncle, and others that the two men were cousins. In 1513 Ammonius brought Vannes to England and employed him as his assistant. Silvestro Gigli, bishop of Worcester and a fellow Lucchese, introduced Vannes to Cardinal Wolsey, who retained him as his Latin secretary in 1514. Ammonius's death three years later, in August 1517, prompted Vannes to write immediately to Wolsey seeking some living previously held by his late kinsman. At the same time, a distraught Erasmus entrusted Vannes with the task of destroying or forwarding any of his extant correspondence with Ammonius. Exasperated at the slow response to his request, Erasmus berated Vannes in subsequent letters, calling him a &#145;monster&#146; and complaining that he had none of the spirit of his relative Ammonius.<br>
<br>In 1523 Vannes was incorporated a bachelor of theology at Cambridge, possibly because he had already taken that degree on the continent. Although he was unsuccessful in his efforts to become bishop of Lucca in 1526, he had sufficient patronage and influence to acquire several ecclesiastical livings in England: by 1530 he held prebends in the cathedrals of Hereford (Cublington) and Salisbury (South Grantham and Bedwyn), Bedwyn having been previously held by the illegitimate son of Wolsey, Thomas Winter.<br>
<br>Vannes began his diplomatic career in earnest in 1527 when, with Cuthbert Tunstall, Sir Thomas More, and other luminaries, he accompanied Wolsey to France to establish a league between England, the Holy Roman empire, France, and Venice. In late November 1528 he and Sir Francis Bryan were sent to Rome as special ambassadors to the pope, each receiving a daily wage of 26<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. Masquerading as an embassy to warn the papacy against agreeing to an imperial peace proposal, the mission was actually intended to induce Pope Clement VII to pronounce Henry VIII's marriage to Katherine of Aragon void <i>ab initio</i>. The ambassadors had other objectives, too, including that of disproving the authenticity of a brief which undermined Henry's arguments for the divorce by removing disabilities found in the original dispensation for the marriage. Vannes was encouraged to use whatever means necessary to secure support, including hiring advocates, bribing cardinals, and even threatening the pope with the withdrawal of English allegiance to Rome. If all else failed, Vannes was instructed to seek Clement VII's approval for Henry to have two wives, &#145;making the children of the second marriage legitimate as well as those of the first, whereof some great reasons and precedents, especially in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, appear&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/2, no. 4977). On their journey Vannes and Bryan stopped in France to meet the French king, Fran&ccedil;ois I, in mid-December, and finally arrived in Rome on 28 January 1529. Clement's ill health delayed the English embassy until late March, when the ambassadors met him informally; they only had a formal audience on 1 April. After the failure of the mission Bryan went to France to serve as ambassador, while Vannes returned to England, travelling via Paris to promote the divorce with the French king and clergy.<br>
<br>Vannes survived the fall of his patron Wolsey, an event that did not impede his advancement. Indeed, some time after 1528 he became Latin secretary to Henry VIII. Appointed collector of papal taxes in England on 17 July 1533, he travelled later that year to Rome, Avignon, and Marseilles in his new capacity. He also continued to accumulate benefices, acquiring prebends in the dioceses of Bath and Wells (Compton Dundon) in May 1534 and York (Bole) in February 1535. He was appointed archdeacon of Worcester in May 1534, and was formally installed as dean of Salisbury on 3 February 1540, a post he appears to have held <i>de facto</i> since 1536, and one that he retained until 28 March 1563. In 1541 he became rector of Tredington, Worcestershire, and acquired the further prebends of Caddington Major in St Paul's in April 1542 and Shipton in Salisbury in 1543. In 1545 he received a special pension of &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from King Henry VIII College, Oxford, as compensation for the canonry he had held in that college until its dissolution.<br>
<br>Upon his accession Edward VI retained Vannes as his Latin secretary with an annual salary of 40 marks. He was reappointed for life on 13 December 1549. Shortly thereafter, in May 1550, Vannes was appointed English ambassador to Venice with a salary of 40<i>s</i>. a day. He visited his native Lucca in November 1551. The protestant Edwardian regime instructed Vannes to keep close watch over Englishmen travelling in Italy, especially those with Catholic tendencies who sought out Cardinal Pole and his circle. Vannes continued to serve as ambassador during the first half of Mary's reign, when he prudently adopted a pro-imperial position. He may also have acted as the queen's spokesman in justifying her determination to execute Thomas Cranmer in spite of his recantation. During his tenure abroad Vannes became involved in some highly questionable activities. In 1554 he hired assassins who attempted to kill Sir Peter Carew. Circumstantial evidence suggests Vannes's involvement in the mysterious death in 1556 of Edward Courtenay, earl of Devon; it is possible that Vannes had him poisoned to foil a plot to marry the earl to Mary's sister, Elizabeth, and then take the English throne. In any event, Vannes requested his recall immediately after Courtenay's demise on 18 September, and returned to English soil some time after October 1556. Queen Elizabeth disregarded any unsavoury rumours and allowed Vannes to retain his livings after 1558.<br>
<br>Vannes died between 28 March and 1 May 1563, leaving two wills, both dated 1 July 1562. His affairs took some time to settle, with one will granted probate on 21 May 1563 and the other being confirmed and proved a full year later, on 10 July 1564. He provided very well for his family: his sister Margaret received a comfortable living for the remainder of her life, and his brother's illegitimate daughter, also named Margaret, was given a dowry of 300 crowns (<i>scutos</i>). Vannes's principal heir, a &#145;Benedict Hudson, alias Vannes&#146;, was most probably his illegitimate son; not only did Vannes bequeath Benedict's mother, Alice, a cow and a valuable bed, but, much more telling, he also left Benedict all family lands in his native Lucca. It may be a pointer to his court connections that he left to Sir William Petre, royal secretary from 1544 to 1557, a &#145;new black satin robe adorned with black velvet newly acquired from Venice&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/46, fol. 173<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Vannes's standing at the English court attracted Italian humanists seeking patronage. Ortensio Lando, eager to honour a fellow Lucchese, dedicated his 1550 work <span class="italic">Miscellaneae questiones</span> to him. It was through Vannes that Pietro Aretino in 1542 sent a copy of his second volume of letters to Henry VIII, to whom it was dedicated. Other literary figures appreciated Vannes's friendship, among them John Leland, who commemorated their relationship in an ode.<br>
