<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Conolly,  Arthur</span>  (1807&#150;1842?), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 2 July 1807, third of the six sons of Valentine Conolly (<i>d</i>. 2 Dec 1819) of 37 Portland Place, London, who made a rapid fortune in India at the close of the eighteenth century, and his wife, Matilda (<i>d</i>. 29 Nov 1819). He was educated at Rugby School (1820&#150;22). A shy and sensitive boy, Conolly was not suited to public-school life, and he suffered there. After leaving Rugby he entered Addiscombe College on 3 May 1822, but resigned on receiving a cavalry cadetship. He travelled to Bengal the same year. Reginald Heber, newly consecrated bishop of Calcutta, was a fellow passenger, and had a profound influence on the young Conolly, who in January 1824 was made cornet in the 6th Bengal native light cavalry, to which his brother <a href="#cosubject_6091">Edward Barry Conolly [<i>see below</i>]</a> was appointed later. Arthur became lieutenant in the regiment on 13 May 1825 and captain on 30 July 1838.<br>
<br>Being in England on sick leave in 1829, Conolly obtained leave to return to India through central Asia. He left London on 10 August 1829, travelled through France and Germany to Hamburg, then continued by sea to St Petersburg, where he stayed a month, and then travelled via Tiflis and Tehran to Asterabad. There he disguised himself as an Asian merchant, with a stock of furs and shawls, hoping to reach Khiva. He left Asterabad for the Turkoman steppes on 26 April 1830, but when the little caravan to which he attached himself was about halfway between Krasnovodsk and Kizil Arvat he was seized by nomads and robbed. The Turkomans were undecided whether to kill him or sell him into slavery. Tribal jealousies in the end secured his release, and he returned to Asterabad on 22 May 1830, from where he travelled to India by way of Mashhad, Herat, and Kandahar, visiting Sind, and finally crossing the Indian frontier in January 1831. He published a lively narrative of the journey&#151;reflecting his bright, hopeful temperament&#151;<span class="italic">A Journey to Northern India</span> (1834). He also contributed papers entitled &#145;The overland journey to India&#146; to <span class="italic">Gleanings in Science</span> (1831). After an interview with Lord William Bentinck at Delhi, Conolly rejoined his regiment, and when stationed at Cawnpore appears to have acquired the lasting friendship of the eccentric Jewish convert Dr Joseph Wolff, then travelling as a missionary in India.<br>
<br>In 1834 Conolly joined the political department and was appointed assistant to the government agent in Rajputana, and in 1838 returned home on furlough, hoping to marry. Disappointed, he sought relief in further professional activity. Russian movements in central Asia were causing anxiety in England, and Conolly proposed to the home government to remove the pretext for Russian advances by negotiating with the principal Uzbek chiefs in order to stop the carrying off of Russian and Persian subjects into slavery. He was provided with letters of recommendation to Lord Auckland, then governor-general of India, by the Board of Control in London, together with &pound;500 for an overland journey. Conolly left London on 11 February 1839, visited Vienna (where he had an interview with Prince Metternich), Constantinople, and Baghdad, where he first met Major Henry Rawlinson, and reached Bombay in November 1839, proceeding from there to Calcutta. The time appeared favourable, and Conolly was sent on to Kabul, where in the spring of 1840 he joined the staff of Sir William Macnaghten, the British envoy with Shah Shuja. One of Macnaghten's brothers had married Conolly's sister.<br>
<br>Passionately religious and enthusiastic, and supporting the abolition of central Asian slavery, Conolly held hopes, which he admitted were somewhat &#145;visionary&#146;, for the political regeneration of central Asia and the ultimate conversion of its people to Christianity. Macnaghten and Conolly in April 1840 planned&#151;the initiative apparently largely Conolly's&#151;that Conolly should go to Turkestan on an ill-defined mission to urge the Uzbek states to combine against Russia, under the leadership of Kokand; initially there was no plan to visit Bukhara. The plan was modified, and in September 1840 Conolly went to Khiva, and in 1841 to Kokand. In Bukhara the amir, Nasrullah, had since December 1838 kept prisoner a British envoy, Colonel Charles Stoddart. The amir, apparently suspicious of Conolly's activities in Kokand, invited him to Bukhara. Conolly, as this apparently fitted his hopes of an Uzbek confederation, went to Bukhara, arriving in October 1841.<br>
<br>In December 1841 the amir, suspicious of British policy and presumably encouraged by British failure in Afghanistan, imprisoned Conolly with Stoddart. Disillusioned, Conolly's views changed, and he came to favour Anglo-Russian co-operation in Turkestan, in the interests of civilization. Conolly was a voluminous and rapid writer. On his travels he noted all he said and did in his journal, a practice he continued even in his dungeon at Bukhara. Five letters, all written in February and March 1842, forming the main portion of Conolly's prison journal, survived his captivity. The last direct news of him alive was in a letter he sent to his brother, then a hostage at Kabul, early in 1842, in which he described the sufferings of Stoddart and himself. For four months they had no change of clothing; their dungeon was foul, insanitary, and infested with vermin. Stoddart was reduced to a skeleton. They had with difficulty persuaded one of their guards to represent their wretched condition to the amir, and were at that time awaiting his reply, having committed themselves to God in the full belief that unless quickly released death must soon end their sufferings. Nevertheless, he wrote, &#145;We are resolved to wear our English honesty and dignity to the last&#146;  (Yapp, 413). The amir had them murdered, probably in June 1842.<br>
<br>The British government being apparently unwilling to act, a committee was formed in London in 1842, on the initiative of Captain John Grover, to obtain the release of the Bukhara captives, and a sum of &pound;500 so collected supplied the funds to dispatch Dr Wolff on a mission to Bukhara. Wolff, after perilous investigations there, concluded that Conolly, with Stoddart and other victims, after enduring fearful agonies in prison, had been cruelly killed some time in 1843, and that the instigator of this was the pretended friend of the English, Abdul Samut Khan, <i>naib</i> or prime minister of Nasir Allah Bahadur, amir of Bukhara.<br>
<br>Although Conolly had undoubted courage and a sense of duty, some of his contemporaries considered him over-enthusiastic and lacking in balance. Sir Alexander Burnes, for example, considered him flighty. Many years later Conolly's prayer book, in which he had written a last record of his sufferings and aspirations when a prisoner, was left at his sister's house in London by a mysterious foreigner, who simply said that he came from Russia. The details were published in Sir John Kaye's account of Conolly in <span class="italic">Lives of Indian Officers</span> (1867).<br>
<br>Three of Conolly's brothers lost their lives in the Indian service.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6091"></a><span class="headword">Edward Barry Conolly</span>  (1808&#150;1840)<span class="occ"></span> was captain, 6th Bengal light cavalry, and at the time of his death was in command of the escort of the British envoy at Kabul. He was shot at Tootundurrah, in Kohistan, north of Kabul, while a volunteer with Sir Robert Sale, in the attack on the fort there on 29 September 1840. He had made many contributions to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</span>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6095"></a><span class="headword">John Balfour Conolly</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1842)<span class="occ"></span> was a cadet of 1833; he became lieutenant, 20th Bengal native infantry, and was afterwards attached to the Kabul embassy. He died of fever while a hostage in the Bala Hissar, Kabul, on 7 August 1842.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_6093"></a><span class="headword">Henry Valentine Conolly</span>  (1806&#150;1855)<span class="occ"></span>, of the Madras civil service, entered Rugby School in the same year as his brother Arthur, and was appointed a writer on the Madras establishment on 19 May 1824. He became assistant to the principal collector at Bellary in 1826, and after holding various posts&#151;including deputy secretary to the military department, Canarese translator to the government, cashier of the government bank, and additional government commissioner for the settlement of Carnatic claims&#151;he was appointed magistrate and collector at Malabar, a post he held for many years. Conolly, who was married, was murdered in his house on 11 September 1855 by some Mopla fanatics in revenge for his role in outlawing their <i>thungai</i>, or saint, a religious leader who had been deported to Jiddah a few years before for sedition. Shortly before his death Conolly was made a provisional member of the council of the Madras government.<br>
