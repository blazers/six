<span class="headword">Blanchard,  Edward Litt Leman</span>  (1820&#150;1889), <span class="occ">writer and playwright</span>, was born on 11 December 1820 at 28 Great Queen Street, London, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2604/', "William Blanchard (1769&#150;1835)")</script>, comic actor with the Kembles' Covent Garden company, and his second wife, Sarah Harrold (1784&#150;1875).<br>
<br>After a brief education in Brixton, Surrey, and then Lichfield, Blanchard went with his parents to New York in 1831. Back in London, and forced by his father's death to find employment at an early age, he became sub-editor of Pinnock's <span class="italic">Guide to Knowledge</span> in 1836. Although he continued to edit periodicals such as <span class="italic">Chambers's London Journal</span> (1841) and the <span class="italic">New London Magazine</span> (1845), he also wrote illustrated guidebooks, among them some of Bradshaw's <span class="roman">Descriptive Railway Guides</span>. He edited Willoughby's <span class="italic">Shakespeare</span>, wrote unmemorable novels, and demonstrated his lifelong interest in spiritualism and s&eacute;ances by founding and editing <span class="italic">The Astrologer and Oracle of Destiny</span> (1845).<br>
<br>Blanchard's most important work, however, was done for the stage, under his own name and the pseudonyms Francesco (or Francisco) Frost and (with T. L. Greenwood) the Brothers Grinn; he wrote innumerable pantomimes, entertainments, farces, and dramas, as well as comic songs such as &#145;A Norrible Tale&#146; and &#145;Villikins and his Dinah&#146;. Beginning with a pantomime for amateurs (1839), in which he devised &#145;trick&#146; staging and played Harlequin, he went on to write annual Christmas pantomimes for the Drury Lane Theatre from 1852 to 1888, as well as for other London and provincial theatres. Sometimes three, even four, of his works were staged concurrently. In these seasonal productions he strove seriously for prettiness and coherence as well as comic effects, and for a moral to adorn the fairy-tales on which many were based. <span class="italic">See Saw Margery Daw, or, Harlequin Holiday and the Island of Ups and Downs</span> (1856), for example, shows Necessity in her cottage &#145;with a Prospect of Hard Work in the Distance&#146;. She says:<blockquote>
<div>those that work are the illustrious,<br>
</div>
<div>And those most noble are the most industrious.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>During the last years of his Drury Lane pantomimes he was made increasingly unhappy by interpolated vulgarisms in his text and by the introduction of music-hall performers.<br>
<br>Blanchard also contributed theatrical obituaries, reviews, and articles about the stage to many periodicals, including <span class="italic">Fun</span>, the <span class="italic">Illustrated Times</span>, the <span class="italic">Era Almanack and Annual</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and <span class="italic">The Era</span>. From 1863 to 1887 he was the drama critic of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. He was married to Amelia (1821&#150;1873), but there appear to have been no children.<br>
<br>Blanchard was one of the kindliest of men and, privately, one of the saddest. In his diary for 11 December 1861 he recorded: &#145;Have at least the satisfaction of knowing that &hellip; I have never injured a living creature&#146;  (Scott and Howard, 1.264). His brother William and William's family, however, were a continual and heavy drain on his resources, when his indefatigable work brought him only between &pound;200 and &pound;400 a year; eventually his income rose to &pound;500 but rarely to &pound;600 or &pound;700. His happiness was greatly increased after his marriage to his long-adored Caroline (1821&#150;1907) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55111/', "Howard, Caroline Cadette")</script>], whom he called Carina, on 11 June 1874. Many years earlier she had married and had gone to New Zealand, and he had lost touch with her, but had never forgotten her. Caroline was a widow by 1874. Having begun his career at such an early age, he always seemed much older than he actually was, and his appearance was anything but youthful. His theatrical knowledge was encyclopaedic, and he did not like to admit ignorance of anything being discussed  (Watson, 172).<br>
<br>After a long illness Blanchard died at his home, 6 Albert Mansions, 114 Victoria Street, Westminster, on 4 September 1889 of &#145;general decay&#146;, though he was only sixty-eight. He was buried on 10 September in Kensington Hanwell cemetery, Ealing, Middlesex, and left an estate valued at &pound;441. Carina, who had been a tireless worker for the Emigration Society, survived him. She was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;50 on 24 May 1890.<br>
