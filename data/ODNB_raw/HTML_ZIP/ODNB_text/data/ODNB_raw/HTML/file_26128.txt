<span class="headword">Spencer,  Henry</span>, first earl of Sunderland  (<em>bap. </em>1620, <em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">politician and royalist army officer</span>, was born at Althorp and baptized on 23 November 1620 at Brington, Northamptonshire, the eldest son and heir of William Spencer, second Baron Spencer of Wormleighton (<i>bap</i>. 1592, <i>d</i>. 1636), and his wife, Lady Penelope Wriothesley (1598&#150;1667), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30073/', "Henry Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Vernon of Hodnet, Shropshire. The family's wealth derived from sheep farming during the Tudor period. Spencer was educated at home at Althorp by private tutors before matriculating from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 8 May 1635. He was created MA on 31 August 1636 on the king's visit to the college and succeeded his father as third Baron Spencer of Wormleighton on 19 December of that year. In what was probably a love match he married the admired Lady Dorothy Sidney [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26120/', "Spencer, Dorothy (1617&#150;1684)")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25525/', "Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester (1595&#150;1677)")</script>, and Dorothy, daughter of Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, at Penshurst, Sussex, on 20 July 1639; his wife was the Sacharissa of Edmund Waller's poem. Until late 1641 the couple passed the years with Spencer's father-in-law, then ambassador to France, in Paris, where their eldest children, Dorothy and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26135/', "Robert Spencer (1641&#150;1702)")</script>, who succeeded him as second earl, were born in July 1640 and September 1641 respectively. The family settled at Althorp in late 1641.<br>
<br>On his return to England Spencer took his seat in the House of Lords and initially supported parliament's struggle with the king. He was nominated to the lord lieutenancy of Northamptonshire on 5 March 1642 and, with parliament's prompting, reviewed the muster of the county's trained bands in the following month. By the summer of 1642, however, he had clearly aligned himself with the beleaguered peace party in the Lords. Clarendon claims Spencer was &#145;recovered to a right understanding, of which he was very capable, by his uncle [the earl] of Southampton&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.181), and he had left Westminster by August 1642.<br>
<br>Spencer may have left parliament to support the king, but he hated the war and ranged himself with those constitutional royalists who were searching for a settlement. Along with Lord Falkland he presented unsuccessful proposals to parliament on 5 September 1642. Weeks later he wrote to his pregnant wife at Penshurst &#145;How much I am unsatisfied with the Proceedings here&#146; and of his distaste for the &#145;Insolency of the Papists&#146; who urged hardline policies on Charles. Honour drew him to the king's side and impelled him to stay there:<blockquote>Neither is there wanting, Daily, handsome occassion to retire, were it not for Grinning Honour. For let occassion be never so handsome, unless a Man were resolved to fight on the Parliament Side, which, for my part, I had rather be hanged, it will be said without doubt, that a man is afraid to fight. If there be an expedient found, to salve the Punctillio of Honour, I would not continue here an Hour. (Collins, 2.667)</blockquote>His explanation for his allegiance has attracted historians' interest.Despite his longing for peace, Spencer was a volunteer in the king's guard at the battle of Edgehill (23 October 1642). The following winter he visited Penshurst, where another daughter, Penelope, was later born to him posthumously. On 6 June 1643 he was created earl of Sunderland, partly, it has been suggested, in acknowledgement of a loan to Charles I. He participated in the attack on Bristol in July, and in August he was in the trenches at the siege of Gloucester. From there he wrote to his wife describing how the activity temporarily dispelled thoughts of &#145;how infinitely more happy I should esteem myself, quietly to enjoy your company at Althorp, than to be troubled with the noises, and engaged in the factions, of the Court, which I shall endeavour to avoid&#146;  (Collins, 2.669&#150;70). His solitude was briefly alleviated by dining with friends from the Great Tew circle, Falkland and Chillingworth.<br>
<br>Sunderland was in the king's horse guard at the first battle of Newbury, on 20 September 1643, when he was fatally wounded by a cannon bullet, shortly before Falkland's fatal charge; he was twenty-three. He was buried at the battlefield, though his heart is supposedly kept in an unmarked lead casket in the Spencer vault at Brington. His will provided a jointure on Wormleighton, Warwickshire, for his wife, and &pound;10,000 and &pound;7000 respectively for his daughters. His two-year-old son was his main heir.<br>
