<span class="headword">May,  John</span>  (1809&#150;1893), <span class="occ">manufacturing chemist</span>, was born in Harwich on 3 February 1809. His father was a ship's captain, working on the Harwich to G&ouml;teborg route, but he retired soon after John was born and the family moved to Ipswich. There John May was educated at a private school and apprenticed to F. J. Hooker, a local chemist and druggist. The 1815 <span class="roman">Apothecaries Act</span> had recognized the role of the chemist and druggist as a wholesale and retail supplier of medicines.<br>
<br>In 1830 May moved to London, finding employment in Battersea with Charles Price, a manufacturing chemist whose business lay chiefly in the preparation of health salts (sulphate of magnesia) and mercurial remedies. At that time the distinguished pharmacologist, Jonathan Pereira (1804&#150;1853), was lecturing in chemistry at the General Dispensary, Aldersgate Street, attached to St Bartholomew's Hospital; May attended his lectures. Medical knowledge of the causes of disease was small and pharmaceutical remedies to alleviate symptoms relied on galenical and, increasingly, chemical ingredients.<br>
<br>In 1834 May left Price and established his own business as a manufacturing chemist, in partnership with Thomas Grimwade and Joseph Pickett, who are believed to have been fellow apprentices with him in Ipswich. The partnership rented premises in Battersea, then an industrial centre although in surroundings still largely rural in character. Pickett died in 1835 and four years later Grimwade decided to retire from manufacturing to take up farming. In 1839, therefore, May took a new partner, William Garrad Baker, like himself an East Anglian by birth, who had recently completed his apprenticeship as a chemist and druggist.<br>
<br>May, aged thirty-one, and Baker, aged twenty-five, signed a new partnership agreement in 1840 which lasted for thirty-six years. In the following year they bought, for &pound;200, a plot of land in Battersea known as Garden Wharf, where the firm's factory was built; it was rebuilt several times&#151;it remained the manufacturing premises until 1934. In the early days of the business May dealt with the sales and marketing side and Baker took charge of the manufacturing. Most of the firm's customers&#151;wholesale drug houses&#151;were in the London area and May visited them all, on foot, once a week. It was an extremely competitive business but May and Baker soon secured itself a place among the leading firms in the London chemical trade, which included Howards and Whiffens.<br>
<br>In 1851 the firm's acids, metallic salts, and pharmaceutical supplies were awarded the prize medal for quality at the Great Exhibition and, four years later, similar accolades were won at the Paris Exhibition. By then the development of the railway network was enabling May and Baker to supply customers further afield than London and, although the wholesale druggists remained its major customers, it also supplied the chemicals which were increasingly used in other industries such as brewing.<br>
<br>May never married and by the early 1860s was living with his unmarried sister Sarah, who was eight years his elder, at Hyde House, 41 Hyde Lane, Battersea, his home for more than thirty years. In 1862 the firm took on an apprentice, Thomas Tyrer, who recalled that May, then aged fifty-three and with completely white hair, interviewed him most searchingly. Tyrer became a great admirer of May, writing, in an obituary in the <span class="italic">Chemist and Druggist</span> in 1893:<blockquote>Mr May was always very severe upon unveracity and anything indefinite and slipshod was to him a cause of great irritation &hellip; His immediate relatives were the recipients of his warmest solicitude, yet he preferred a loneliness which seemed painful to me. He was as unobtrusive in his religious and political views as in his life; and loved the &#145;old order&#146; of things and disliked much of the new. He was eminently a man of wise caution, a hater of deceit and a lover of truth.</blockquote>At the end of 1876 May retired, selling his share of the partnership to Richard Heath, a Warwick solicitor who bought it for his stepson, William Blenkinsop. Largely at May's insistence, Tyrer also became a junior partner in the business at the same time. With May's agreement, the firm continued to use the name May and Baker under which it was by then known as a respectable and steady business. Living in Battersea, May kept in touch with Tyrer and Baker and, in 1890 when the partnership was dissolved and the business incorporated, he agreed that his name should continue to be used. In January 1891, when he was nearly eighty-two, he became a director of the new company. He was already suffering from heart disease and, on 5 November 1893, at the age of eighty-four, he died of pneumonia at Hyde House.<br>
<br>The business May had founded continued to grow and in the twentieth century became well known for its discovery of the drug known as M &amp; B 693, introduced in 1938 as a cure for bacterial pneumonia. Although the company was owned, from 1927, by the French chemical company Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, it was not until the early 1990s that use of the name May and Baker ended.<br>
