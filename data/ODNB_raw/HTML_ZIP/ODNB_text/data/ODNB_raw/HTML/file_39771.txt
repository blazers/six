<span class="headword">Lessingham,  Jane</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jane Hemet; <em>married name </em>Jane Stott]</span>  (1738/9&#150;1783), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in 1738 or 1739 if the age at death inscribed on her tombstone was correct. Nothing is known about her parents, although a brother served as a witness at her marriage in 1753. Very little is known about her personal life before coming to the stage. As Jane Hemet, spinster, she was married to John Stott, naval commander, at St Paul's, Covent Garden, in 1753. In their divorce proceedings in 1765, recorded in <span class="italic">Trials for Adultery</span> (1780), witnesses attested to the fact that Mrs Stott had given birth to a daughter during the three years her husband was away at sea. John Taylor in his <span class="italic">Records of my Life</span> (1832) recalled that she lived with the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7536/', "Samuel Derrick (1724&#150;1769)")</script> as his wife and that Derrick was responsible for bringing her to the stage. If so, it seems probable that their relationship began in the years when her husband was at sea, as they coincide with her initial appearance on the stage as Desdemona in <span class="italic">Othello</span> in 1756. She did not appear again until February 1762, when she played the title role in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>. She evidently took the name Lessingham as her stage alias and used it first in March 1762, when she played Sylvia in <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span> by George Farquhar. Taylor also noted Lessingham's ability as a comic actress, but further described her as an extraordinary character who frequented coffee houses in men's clothing.<br>
<br>Lessingham remained at Covent Garden until 1763, but subsequently worked at Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin and at Drury Lane in London, as well as at provincial theatres in Bath, Bristol, and Richmond. She returned in 1767 to Covent Garden, where she remained for the duration of her career. There was always some suspicion that she maintained her position at Covent Garden because of her long-standing relationship with the theatre manager <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12421/', "Thomas Harris (d. 1820)")</script>. David Garrick thought her not worth the &pound;4 a week she demanded in 1767 and refused to re-employ her at Drury Lane. As Harris's mistress she was a focal point in the managerial disputes at Covent Garden in 1768; she was named several times in the pamphlets, arguing for her right to a private dressing-room and to particular roles, specifically that of Imogene in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>. The critic Francis Gentleman did not think she was worth all the fuss, and in <span class="italic">The Theatres</span> (1772) described her as a &#145;tasteless milksop&#146;. William Hawkins was more complimentary in his <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</span> (1775), commenting that she was agreeable in comedy but dismal in tragedy. Such criticism is borne out by the roles she favoured: Clackit in <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> by Garrick, Madame Florival in <span class="italic">The Deuce is in him</span> by George Colman the elder, Nerissa in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and Lady Anne in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>. Harris himself was quick to defend her and in <span class="italic">The Ring: an Epistle, Addressed to Mrs. L&#151;M</span> (1768), amid protestations of her beauty and virtue, argued that she was as strong a performer as Elizabeth Barry and Mary Ann Yates.<br>
<br>Jane Lessingham also won a reputation for her writing: there were rumours that she herself wrote <span class="italic">The Ring</span>, and she advertised two publications that either never appeared or were published in such small numbers as not to have survived. <span class="italic">Expostulations with George Colman</span> was advertised as forthcoming in December 1767, and a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Hampstead Contest</span> was mentioned in a legal dispute over some property in 1775. The <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> noted in May 1777 that she &#145;still amuses herself and the world, with her pen in the public papers&#146;.<br>
<br>Jane Lessingham's last appearance on the stage was in November 1782 as Jacintha in Benjamin Hoadly's <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband</span>. Her salary of &pound;7 a week in the last five seasons of her career places her below the premier performers Mary Ann Yates and Frances Abington in prestige and talent, but well above the poorer actresses, who were paid less than &pound;1 a week. She died on 13 March 1783, and was buried four days later in Hampstead churchyard. Her will, written in the December before her death, left her estate to Thomas Harris in trust for the use of her sons Thomas, Charles, and Edwin. A fourth son, William Frederick, was also named, but there was no mention of the daughter she bore while she was married to John Stott. The will was signed &#145;Jane Hemet&#146; and was proved by Thomas Harris in 1784. The original stone on her grave, bearing her maiden name, was replaced in 1802 by her son William Frederick with a stone inscribed &#145;Mrs. Jane Lessingham of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden&#146;, and noting her age as being forty-four.<br>
