<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Throckmorton, Sir  Nicholas</span>  (1515/16&#150;1571), <span class="occ">diplomat and member of parliament</span>, was the fourth of the seven sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38067/', "Sir George Throckmorton (c.1489&#150;1552)")</script> of Coughton, Warwickshire, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Nicholas, first Baron Vaux of Harrowden, and his wife, Elizabeth Parr. Nicholas always regarded Katherine Parr as his first cousin. His birth date is based on John Foxe's statement that Throckmorton was thirty-five at the time of the trial of Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, in January 1551.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareerunderHenryandEdward"></a>Early career under Henry and Edward</h2>When Sir George Throckmorton died in 1552 Coughton passed to his eldest son Robert. As a younger son, Nicholas could expect little in the way of patrimony. A biographical poem, written some years later by his nephew Thomas, provides some details of his youth; the poem is demonstrably unreliable at some points, but is at least plausible here. It relates that as &#145;a brother fourth&#146; he was &#145;far from hope of land&#146;, so &#145;by parents' hest [he] served as a page to Richmond's Duke&#146;  (Rowse, 9). This was Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond and illegitimate son of Henry VIII. Sir William Parr was Richmond's steward, and it is likely that Throckmorton's parents secured this post for him. In 1532 he accompanied the young duke to France, for Henry VIII's meeting with Fran&ccedil;ois I at Boulogne. He stayed abroad for nearly a year, &#145;and learned the tongue, though nothing readily&#146;  (ibid.). After Richmond's death in 1536 Throckmorton entered the service of the Parrs. He served on the Scottish borders in 1543. Then, when the king married Katherine Parr later that year, he joined her household at court, along with his brother Clement. He returned to France in 1544 as a captain in the army that captured Boulogne. He began to acquire lands in Hertfordshire, and was granted an annuity from revenues that had formerly belonged to Pipewell Abbey. Other members of his family remained staunch Catholics, but he and his brothers Clement, Kellam (or Kenelm), and George began to move in the evangelical circles favoured by Queen Katherine. He visited the protestant martyr Anne Askew in prison and was present at her execution on 16 July 1546.<br>
<br>The influence of Queen Katherine was probably also behind Throckmorton's entering parliament. With few intervals he was an MP during four reigns, being first returned in 1545 for the Essex borough of Maldon, where the queen was a major landowner. His connections and his religious stance helped him to continue to gain favour during Edward VI's reign. In 1547 he served under Protector Somerset in the Scottish campaign which culminated in the battle of Pinkie, and brought news of the English victory to the young king afterwards; for this he was granted an annuity of &pound;100 and knighted in what the poem describes as an irregular ceremony performed by Edward in high spirits. No official record of this knighthood survives. The same source describes Throckmorton becoming a personal favourite of Edward's:<blockquote>
<div>The King fancied me more and more,<br>
</div>
<div>For as his years so did my favour grow.<br>
</div> (Rowse, 15)</blockquote>About 1549 Throckmorton married Anne, daughter of Sir Nicholas Carew of Beddington. The Carews, like the Throckmortons, had long-standing court connections.<br>
<br>After the fall of the duke of Somerset in autumn 1549 Throckmorton was appointed a gentleman of Edward's privy chamber and given the lucrative office of treasurer of the mint. His promotion suggests that he was already <i>persona grata</i> with John Dudley, earl of Warwick. In April 1551 he was a member of the retinue which accompanied the marquess of Northampton on embassy to France, while after his return Throckmorton, according to Edward's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, was one of the gentlemen who escorted the dowager queen of Scots to Hampton Court in October, after a storm had forced her fleet to land at Portsmouth. He was involved in the king's progressive introduction to government business, and is said to have suggested that William Thomas, a humanist scholar who was also one of the clerks of the council, should prepare papers discussing political issues for Edward's consideration. As part of the government's peace-keeping policy he was licensed in 1552 to retain a small force of twenty-five men. In the previous year he had exchanged his annuity for the Northamptonshire manor of Paulerspury and additional lands in several counties. He had remained an MP, representing Devizes in the parliament that sat from 1547 to 1552 and Northamptonshire in that of March 1553; it was a measure of his continuing favour with Dudley, now duke of Northumberland, that his return for the latter seat should have been supported by the council.<h2>
<a name="QueenJaneandQueenMary"></a>Queen Jane and Queen Mary</h2>Throckmorton apparently supported the attempt to crown Lady Jane Grey after Edward VI's death. He was one of the signatories of the letters patent of mid-June 1553 designating her the rightful successor, and his wife, Anne, deputized for Jane when the latter agreed to be godmother to Edward Underhill's son. According to contemporary reports Throckmorton tried to prevent Sir Thomas Tresham from proclaiming Mary Tudor as queen at Northampton, and barely escaped with his life. It is possible, however, that his objection was to Tresham's usurping his own role as sheriff, rather than to Mary's accession, for there are signs that he tried to hedge his bets; he is said to have been one of those who sent word to Mary of Edward's death, warning her not to fall into Northumberland's hands, and he was certainly among those appointed to escort her to London.<br>
<br>Throckmorton remained a member of the Commons, sitting in Mary's first parliament (October 1553) for the borough of Old Sarum rather than for Northamptonshire. His fellow burgess was his brother John, and it is likely that they secured their seats through the patronage of their kinsman William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. Nicholas Throckmorton appears to have opposed the queen's restoration of Catholicism&#151;his name is on a list of those who &#145;stood for the true religion&#146; during this session. But although he recalled hearing Sir Richard Southwell speak against Mary's Spanish marriage&#151;&#145;I did see the whole realm against it&#146;, he wrote  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.460)&#151;there is no record of his having spoken against it himself.<br>
<br>Whether or not it was because of his behaviour in parliament, Throckmorton soon came under suspicion, and on 1 January 1554 he was bound over in &pound;2000 to be of good behaviour. Despite this, on 20 February, nearly three weeks after the surrender of Sir Thomas Wyatt, Throckmorton was committed to the Tower and charged with treason for supporting Wyatt's attempt to prevent the queen's marriage to Philip of Spain. The indictment at his trial, on 17 April 1554, went so far as to say that he was &#145;a principal, deviser, procurer and contriver of the late Rebellion; and that Wyatt was but his minister&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 892). The judges, as always, favoured the crown, but Throckmorton gave a bravura display of eloquence and learning to run rings round his accusers, quite possibly with the assistance, in spite of official prohibitions, of a sympathetic legal adviser. He poured ridicule on the prosecutors' attempts to find him guilty by association, and repeatedly caught them out on points of law, to the extent that Serjeant Stanford observed ruefully that &#145;If I had thought you had been so well furnished with Book Cases I would have been better provided for you&#146;  (ibid.). He was helped in this by the fact that the Henrician treason statutes had been repealed, and that his own alleged activities were arguably not treasonous under the statute of 26 <span class="roman">Edward III</span>. Addressing himself at least as often to the jury as to the judges, Throckmorton also played the patriotic card for all it was worth, making no effort to conceal his distaste for the queen's marriage, only denying that there was anything treasonable about this: &#145;It was no treason, nor no procurement of treason, to talk against the coming hither of the Spaniards&#146;  (ibid., 893). His strategy worked, and the jury acquitted him.<br>
<br>The London populace rejoiced, and Wyatt's head was stolen that night, but the jurors were taken into custody, most of them having to pay heavily to be released. Throckmorton himself was kept in gaol until January 1555, in the expectation that further charges would be brought against him. After his release on a bond of &pound;2000 he retired to his home in Northamptonshire, but in June 1556 he fled to France, fearing that he would be suspected of complicity in Henry Dudley's conspiracy. He protested his innocence, however, and Mary came to believe him, allowing his wife to send him money and then pardoning him and allowing him to return to England in May 1557. She also restored property confiscated at the time of his flight. Shortly before Mary's death Throckmorton served in the army fighting in France under the earl of Pembroke, and he also began a correspondence with Princess Elizabeth.<h2>
<a name="Elizabethsambassador"></a>Elizabeth's ambassador</h2>At the time of Elizabeth's accession Throckmorton sent her a list of suggested political appointments. Although his choice for secretary, Sir William Cecil, was indeed appointed, Throckmorton's advice was probably of little consequence; his other recommendations were ignored. He had suggested that Nicholas Heath, the Catholic archbishop of York, should remain lord chancellor and that some further members of Mary's council might also be retained. Sir Richard Morison had characterized Throckmorton as a &#145;Machiavellist&#146;, and some of his advice to the queen validated the description. &#145;It shall not be meet&#146;, he wrote, &#145;that either the old [councillors] or the new should wholly understand what you mean, but to use them as instruments to serve yourself with&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1509&#150;58</span>, 3.497).<br>
<br>Throckmorton had not sat in Mary's latter parliaments, but he was returned for Lyme Regis in 1559 and for Tavistock in 1563. The journals do not record any speeches by him in the Commons, but in the 1566 session he was a member of committees dealing with law reform and the succession, and on 5 November he was one of thirty members summoned to court to hear the queen's message regarding the succession.<br>
<br>Throckmorton's chief employment under Elizabeth was as a diplomat. He was well served by his intimate knowledge of public affairs and his flair for gathering intelligence. Like many of Elizabeth's advisers, he was preoccupied by fear of a continental Catholic conspiracy to unseat the queen and restore the old faith. He was eager to support the Huguenots in France, a policy to which Elizabeth was not yet converted. In May 1559 he was sent to France on his first embassy. He was given a magnificent allowance of plate with which to impress the French but had to borrow &pound;1000 to meet his living expenses. His goals were to terminate French influence in Scotland and to regain English control of Calais, which the French had seized just before Mary's death. His correspondence with Cecil reveals the religious difficulties he had to face: when he refused to kneel at the elevation of the host he was ordered either to conform or to absent himself from services. In 1560 the Guises accused him of being involved in the conspiracy of Amboise. He overestimated the strength of the Huguenots, urged the queen to accept their offer of Le Havre in exchange for military aid, and berated Cecil for indecision. When Cecil negotiated the treaty of Edinburgh guaranteeing that Scotland would ally with England, not France, Throckmorton was given the task of securing its ratification by Mary, queen of Scots, and her husband, the French king, Fran&ccedil;ois II. He also had to bear the scandalous reports of Elizabeth's romance with Sir Robert Dudley (later earl of Leicester); there were nasty speeches which, he said, &#145;my ears glow to hear&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, <i>1560&#150;61</i>, 348).<br>
<br>When Queen Mary decided to return to Scotland following her husband's death in 1561, she sought permission to travel through England. Throckmorton was not able to obtain it, so in the end she sailed directly from France to Scotland, not without some resentment at her treatment. In 1561 Throckmorton asked to be allowed to return to England himself, but the queen, troubled by a lack of competent diplomats, ignored his pleas. Lady Throckmorton did go home in 1562, and on her urging Elizabeth told Sir Thomas Smith to prepare to succeed Throckmorton as ambassador. But although Smith went to France, Catherine de' Medici, the French dowager queen, refused to grant Throckmorton permission to leave and, after the English accepted Le Havre from the Huguenots, imprisoned him. Moreover Smith and Throckmorton quarrelled, it having become clear that Smith was Cecil's man, whereas Dudley was Throckmorton's patron. In France Throckmorton came to be hated by both the Catholic Guises and the Huguenots. Finally in 1563 he succeeded in negotiating the treaty of Troyes, which settled little and spelt the end of English hopes of regaining Calais.<br>
<br>In 1564 Throckmorton was at last allowed to return to England. Compensation for some of the expenses of his embassy came in the form of appointment to two lucrative offices, those of chamberlain of the exchequer and chief butler of England. He was soon sent to Scotland, with instructions to prevent Mary Stuart's marriage to Lord Darnley and if possible encourage her to marry Dudley, who had been created earl of Leicester. Success was hardly to be hoped for, and Throckmorton came home empty-handed. In 1567, after Darnley's murder and Mary's abdication and imprisonment, he returned to Scotland seeking Mary's release from captivity and a concord between her and the rebel Scottish lords. This too was unachievable. On Elizabeth's orders he declined to attend the coronation of James VI; having once again alienated both sides, he was recalled in September 1567.<br>
<br>His unsuccessful diplomatic career now ended, Throckmorton attempted to avoid public life. But in 1569 he was charged with advocating the marriage of Queen Mary to the fourth duke of Norfolk. After a brief imprisonment at Windsor he remained under house arrest until the spring of 1570. He died in London of what was called &#145;a peripneumonia&#146; on 12 February 1571. Leicester wrote to Walsingham:<blockquote>We have lost on Monday our good friend Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, who died in my house, being there taken suddenly in great extremity on Tuesday before; his lungs were perished, but a sudden cold he had taken was the cause of his sudden death. God hath his soul, and we his friends great loss of his body. (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1558&#150;1603</span>, 3.499)</blockquote>The rumour that he had eaten a poisoned salad is unlikely to be true.<h2>
<a name="Burialfamilyandachievements"></a>Burial, family, and achievements</h2>Sir Nicholas Throckmorton was buried in the chancel of the parish church of St Katharine Cree in Aldgate, near his London residence, a mansion that had belonged to the abbey of Evesham. He had never been able to build a country house on his land at Paulerspury; instead he and his wife, who survived him, used her family home at Beddington, Surrey, when they found it possible to enjoy country life. In his will, dated 8 February 1571, Throckmorton confirmed an earlier deed in which he left a life interest in his properties in Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire to his wife, who was named his executor, with reversion to their eldest son William, then aged about eighteen. Lands in Worcestershire were to go to their second son Arthur, with reversions to his younger brothers Robert, Thomas, Nicholas, and Henry. (In the event William, who was a lunatic, did not inherit the eldest son's share, which went to Arthur.) Thomas was to have the London house, and Throckmorton's daughter Elizabeth, together with her brothers Nicholas and Henry, were to receive &pound;500 each. Further bequests were made to Throckmorton's brothers Kellam and Clement, his cousin Margaret Butler, his niece Katherine Throckmorton, and several of his servants. The earl of Leicester, Sir Walter Mildmay (chancellor of the exchequer), Sir John Throckmorton, and Francis Carew were among those named to supervise the execution of the will and were left such mementoes as standing gilt cups and bowls adorned with rosemary branches. Throckmorton showed his protestant convictions in his stated desire that his funeral sermon should be preached by either Thomas Sampson or Thomas Lever, both leading puritan divines, as well as in his gift of 40<i>s</i>. to the Dutch church in London. His relative Job Throckmorton, the likeliest author of the Martin Marprelate tracts, was left a coat, a cloak, and a sword. Throckmorton's daughter Elizabeth, who was only eight when he died, later married Sir Walter Ralegh.<br>
<br>Throckmorton's large Renaissance tomb may still be seen at St Katharine Cree, where his head lies on his helmet, tilted towards the viewer. A fine anonymous portrait of him is preserved in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Most of his personal papers came into the possession of Sir Henry Wotton, who gave them to Charles I; they are now in the Public Record Office, London. Despite his involvement in many of the crucial episodes of the mid-Tudor period, Throckmorton never established himself as a diplomat or politician of the first rank. In intellect he was no match for Cecil, Walsingham, or Mildmay, and he lacked Leicester's charisma and connections. His Machiavellian qualities enabled him to ingratiate himself, if only temporarily, with both Mary and Elizabeth, but all too often served only to complicate his conduct of business. He seems, indeed, to have been an obsessive conspirator, who always did things in a roundabout way, when a straightforward approach might in fact have served him better. Consequently his greatest interest for posterity is arguably as a representative of the protestant side of the prolific Throckmorton family, perhaps less well known than their Catholic kinsmen but abler and more interesting.<br>
