<span class="headword">Baker,  Alexander</span>  (1582&#150;1638), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born in Norfolk on 25 March 1582. He studied grammar and humanities for five years. Some time before 1600 or 1601 he left England for Spain, where he studied philosophy and theology at a Jesuit college in Seville. As he is not mentioned in Murphy's list of students at the English College in Seville, he may have been at another seminary there. In 1608 he was ordained subdeacon in Seville, deacon in Cadiz, and priest in Malaga. He entered the society at the English noviciate in Louvain on 23 April 1612, pronouncing his first vows on 23 April 1613. He was socius to the vice-prefect of the English mission in Brussels from 1614 to 1617. In Brussels in 1615 he reconciled William Coke (later ordained priest in Rome), a son of Sir Edward Coke, the famous lawyer, to the Catholic church. Baker then served as confessor at the Jesuit college in Douai (1617&#150;18) and procurator and consultor at the English College in St Omer. He returned to Spain about 1621, first to Seville and then to the English College in Valladolid. By 1624 he was serving on the English mission as superior of the residence of Blessed Stanislaus (Devon) until 1626.<br>
<br>Some time after Baker's return to England, probably in 1625, he was arrested. Through the intercession of the French ambassador Baker and ten other Catholics were pardoned by Charles I on 12 July 1625 to the annoyance of a parliament eager to enforce penal laws against Catholic priests. Under Elizabeth, parliament contended, priests were pardoned only after conviction upon their banishment from a kingdom to which they were not to return under pain of death. On the contrary Baker had not yet been convicted and was not required to leave the kingdom &#145;and being now at liberty his conversation will be very dangerous to the perverting of many of his Majesty's subjects&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, quoted in Foley, 1.154). There survives (TNA: PRO, SP 14/189/25, under date 1625) a manuscript by Baker in defence of the doctrine of regeneration by baptism as held by Catholics, showing its difference from the opinion of protestants.<br>
<br>After a year or two in the house of probation of St Ignatius (London), where he was professed of the four vows on 23 May 1627, Baker returned to Devon in 1629. Henry Foley's quasi-literal translation from the Latin &#145;Summaria mortuorum&#146;  (Rome, Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu, Anglia 7, 267) that Baker twice journeyed to &#145;the remotest territories of the Indies&#146; (&#145;ad remotas Indorum terras&#146;; Foley, 7/1.28) was transformed by the author of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> article into the claim that he &#145;twice visited India as a missionary&#146;. Baker travelled to North America, first to Newfoundland from approximately Easter to Christmas in 1629 and then to the recently founded colony in Maryland in 1634. With the exception of his eight months in Maryland, Baker worked in London throughout the 1630s until his death there on 24 August 1638.<br>
