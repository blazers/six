<span class="headword">Kingscote <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wolff]</span>,  Adeline Georgiana Isabella</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Lucas Cleeve, Mary Walpole]</span>  (1860&#150;1908), <span class="occ">novelist and travel writer</span>, was born in Corfu on 16 November 1860, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36990/', "Sir Henry Drummond Charles Wolff (1830&#150;1908)")</script>, diplomatist and MP, who at the time of her birth was serving on the Ionian Islands, and his wife, Adeline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Douglas (1826/7&#150;1916). Her paternal grandfather was the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29836/', "Revd Joseph Wolff")</script>, co-founder of the Irvingite Church. An accomplished linguist, Kingscote passed the senior local examination of the Oxford University Local Examinations Delegacy in 1877. On 25 June 1885 in St Paul's, Wilton Place, London, she married Howard Kingscote (1844&#150;1917), a lieutenant-colonel in the Oxfordshire light infantry. Her husband was posted to India, where she gave birth to their three children (a daughter and two sons). She wrote <span class="italic">Tales of the Sun, or, Folklore of Southern India</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">The English Baby in India and How to Rear it</span> (1893), both published under the name Mrs H. Kingscote. The latter offers sensible advice but demonstrates contemporary prejudice in arguing against the use of Indian nurses.<br>
<br>The Kingscotes had returned to England by 1891, and in 1895, when Howard Kingscote was appointed commander of Cowley barracks, they moved into Bury Knowle House in Headington, Oxfordshire. There Kingscote began her prolific career as a novelist. Under the pseudonym Lucas Cleeve she published more than sixty novels, including <span class="italic">The Woman who Wouldn't</span> (1895), her response to Grant Allen's <span class="italic">The Woman who Did</span> (1895). She wrote <span class="italic">The Love Seeker</span> (1908) as Mary Walpole. Feminist concerns figure in the novels: in her posthumously published novel <span class="italic">The Love Letters of a Faithless Wife</span> (1911), for example, the heroine, Hertha Atherton, feels so unfulfilled by her marriage to a cold and neglectful husband that she contemplates embarking upon a series of extramarital liaisons. Hertha argues that there are two kinds of husbands: &#145;The men who love again anywhere and everywhere, and who are unfaithful; and the men who, when they have married a wife, don't want to love or be loved any more&#146;. Her husband falls into the latter camp; none the less Hertha remains faithful&#151;but the very fact of her temptation serves as a warning to unappreciative husbands.<br>
<br>Though Kingscote continued to write until her death, at times producing as many as eight books a year, she is remembered more for her charm and financial irresponsibility than for her works of fiction. Her powers of persuasion enabled her to extract large sums of money from male admirers, while her &#145;consuming brown eyes&#146;  (Jenkins) captivated the future MP for Oxford, Frank Gray. Working as a solicitor's clerk in 1898, he met Kingscote when he went to Bury Knowle House to serve writs on her. She was described by Gray as &#145;the finest adventuress I ever met&#146;  (ibid.), but her extravagance caught up with her in 1899 when she was forced to declare bankruptcy for the astonishing sum of &pound;100,000. The entire contents of Bury Knowle House, down to the bottles of Mo&euml;t et Chandon in the cellar, were auctioned in June 1899. Two clergymen, the vicars of Cowley and Headington, who had stood surety for her, and the ninth Baron Byron, who had lent her &pound;50,000, were also bankrupted as a result. Undaunted by financial disaster, she continued to write until her death at Ch&acirc;teau d'Oex in Switzerland on 13 September 1908.<br>
