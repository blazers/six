<span class="headword">Fenwick <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jago]</span>,  Eliza</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Revd David Blair]</span>  (1766?&#150;1840), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was probably born on 1 February 1766 to Thomas and Elizabeth Jago and baptized Elizabeth on 25 June at Pelynt, Cornwall. Little is known of her early life although she spoke of a sister and a brother who remained in Cornwall. Her various careers suggest that she received a typically limited girl's education with accomplishments, rather than depth of study, prominent. Her disastrous marriage to the feckless John Fenwick probably took place in the late 1780s and was to provide her with ample opportunity to develop her survival skills. His inability to &#145;persevere in sobriety&#146;  (Wedd, 57) caused her to leave him several times during the 1800s. In order to end &#145;this struggle, this perpetual warfare&#146;  (ibid., 1), to support herself, her daughter, Eliza, and her son, Orlando, and at the same time satisfy her restless nature, she threw herself into a series of short-lived projects which ranged from running a school, translating, print-colouring, and governessing. Her friends, who included Mary Hays, Thomas Holcroft, William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Smith, and Charles and Mary Lamb, seldom resisted her pleas for assistance and in November 1807 she took over the running of William Godwin's newly established Juvenile Library in Skinner Street, Clerkenwell, London, until she escorted her actress daughter to Ireland soon after. John Fenwick was last known to be alive in 1817 but his wife referred to him as being &#145;morally dead&#146; in 1821, suggesting he was still alive.<br>
<br>In 1795 Eliza Fenwick's epistolary novel <span class="italic">Secresy, or, The Ruin on the Rock</span> had been published &#145;By a Woman&#146;. This was an important contribution to the late eighteenth-century radical novel. Using powerful images of confinement and escape, it tells of the romantic but misguided attachment of Sibella, whose defiance of her restrictive education leads to her sexual maturity and subsequent death. Ostensibly demonstrating &#145;the fatal end of an ungoverned passion&#151;virtuous in its object, but vicious in its excess&#146;, the novel's conflicting and more convincing emphasis is on the heroine's search for independence and her defiance towards the &#145;moats and walls [which] are feeble barriers to a determined will&#146;. In hindsight, the novel may be seen as contributing to a new tradition of &#145;Jacobin&#146; novels which add female issues, especially those arising out of inadequate female education, to the agenda. The novel was well received by the more liberal journals but, despite its critical success, and an announcement in the August 1800 number of the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> that a second novel was in progress, Fenwick appears to have abandoned the genre, most of her subsequent publications being educative and for children, sometimes publishing under the pseudonym Revd David Blair.<br>
<br>In 1814 Eliza Fenwick eagerly sought a new start by following her now married daughter to Barbados, where they opened an initially thriving school but were forced to move again, settling in America in 1822. Despite approaching each new situation with an indomitable optimism bordering on the manic, several events seemed to support her fatalistic pessimism: Orlando died of yellow fever in 1816; her daughter died in 1828; two of her grandsons drowned. She referred to not having &#145;trod the rosy paths of life&#146;  (Wedd, 3) and in her personal and published writings she extended this belief to argue that women are particularly &#145;born to suffer&#146;  (ibid., 50) because of their gendered circumstances. Her thirty-year correspondence with Mary Hays vividly recounts her search for independence, her indebtedness to friends, her financial insecurity, as well as her impetuosity and blind faith in her new ventures which quickly transform into &#145;slavery&#146;. She believed herself to be &#145;pursued by a malign and inexorable fate&#146;  (ibid.), which, although aided by her hasty plans, does seem to have dogged her life. Despite this belief, she displayed a buoyant resilience in the face of misfortune, and a relentless instinct to survive. Charlotte Smith considered her to be &#145;not only a Woman of talents, but of great sweetness of temper, and an excellent heart&#146;  (Smith to Hays, 26 July 1800) and Mary Hays had never &#145;seen in woman more patient sweetness, fortitude, activity, ingenuity &amp; resource&#146;  (Hays to Henry Crabb Robinson, 26 Nov 1807). Eliza Fenwick died at Providence, Rhode Island, USA, in December 1840.<br>
<br>Annie F. Wedd's edition of Fenwick's letters to Mary Hays has helped to establish further the extent of her interest in feminism in the late eighteenth century and in the unfairness of women's inferior position in general. The letters show her to be an ebullient woman who, although very aware of life's injustices, refused to be overcome by them.<br>
