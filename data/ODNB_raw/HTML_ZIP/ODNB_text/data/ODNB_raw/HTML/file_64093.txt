<span class="headword">Brodie,  Alexander, of Brodie</span>  (1697&#150;1754), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 17 August 1697, the second son of George Brodie MP (<i>d</i>. 1715), of Brodie and Aslick, Elgin, and his wife, Emilia, the fifth daughter and coheir of James Brodie of Elgin. He was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he matriculated in 1710, and, it is believed, at Leiden, where he may have matriculated in 1719.<br>
<br>Brodie was descended from an ancient Moray family with a long-established interest in politics, his father and grandfather both having represented local seats in parliament. In 1720 he succeeded his brother James (1695&#150;1720), both as laird of Brodie and as MP for Elginshire (James had been returned at a by-election in January 1720, but died the following October). Alexander held the seat without opposition for over twenty years, from 29 December 1720 to 25 May 1741. On 3 September 1724 he married Mary Sleigh (1704&#150;1760), the daughter of Major Samuel Sleigh of the 16th foot; they had a son, Alexander (1741&#150;1759), and a daughter, Emilia (<i>b</i>. 1730).<br>
<br>Brodie was a loyal government supporter and was rewarded by appointment as lord Lyon king of arms by a commission of 6 July 1727, with a salary of &pound;300 a year. He was the first lord Lyon of the Hanoverian dynasty, and his appointment took place under exceptional circumstances, since his predecessor, Sir Alexander Erskine, had been deep in Jacobite intrigues and the office of lord Lyon was viewed as a centre of Jacobite sympathies. In addition, everything Scottish was viewed from London with suspicion bordering on hatred: Brodie's commission was the first made without reference to Scottish sources and the first not to carry the hitherto customary knighthood. Brodie nevertheless adopted the title lord Lyon king of arms and the prefix &#145;honourable&#146; and maintained the right to walk in the coronation procession of George II. Despite the necessity to be resident in London for a large part of the year to carry out his parliamentary duties, Brodie took an active interest in the business of the Lyon court. He is said to have enforced the laws of arms with vigour and impartiality, and even such exalted offenders as the earl and countess of Wemyss suffered deletion and removal of bogus arms which they had created. Matriculation of arms and the heraldic and genealogical business of the Lyon court seems to have been conducted with understanding and appreciation under his direction.<br>
<br>Brodie was politically attached to Lord Ilay, Walpole's election manager for Scotland, to the extent of &#145;giving himself the airs of being my Lord Ilay's minister in the north&#146;  (Fraser, 1.379). During intrigues surrounding the 1734 general election he came into conflict with several neighbouring influential landowners, including Lord Lovat, with whom he quarrelled violently in January 1733. According to Lovat, Brodie:<blockquote>abus'd me, threaten'd me and insulted me &hellip; He first accus'd me sillily that I and all the Frasers had made a league with Culodin against Grant &hellip; Then he threatened me, and told me he would blow me up with the Earle of Ilay. I told him that he and all the Brodies on earth joined to all the divels in hell could not blow me up with the Earle of Ilay &hellip; I own my temper was much try'd &hellip; but bless God, providence stiffled my passion, that I did not send the mad fool to hell as he deserv'd. (Lovat to Sir James Grant, 23 Jan 1733, Fraser, 1.379)</blockquote>Brodie then set out to gain control of Nairnshire, but the candidate he put up at a by-election in 1735 was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>In 1741 Brodie was forced to surrender his Elginshire seat to Sir Ludovick Grant, but he was brought in for Caithness by his nephew George Sinclair of Ulbster, its hereditary sheriff. Brodie was a government informer, and at the time of his death he was receiving a secret-service pension of &pound;300 per year. After the Jacobite rising of 1745 he reported to the duke of Newcastle that the earl of Sutherland had been harbouring a prominent rebel. It was also said that he had helped to procure evidence against Lord Lovat, observing that &#145;it will be of the greatest service to the family of Lovat to have the old man beheaded, which would save the son&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32709, fol. 389). The next year he reported to Newcastle the landing of a Jacobite agent by a French privateer on the west coast of the highlands. He took a hard line over the <span class="roman">Highland Dress Bill</span> in 1746, dismissing the doubts of those who felt it should not apply to clans who had taken the government's side during the rising and saying that this &#145;would not do; the thing must be general or could have no effect&#146;  (Brodie to Duncan Forbes, 1 July 1746, Warrand, 5.112&#150;13).<br>
<br>However, Brodie could show compassion and magnanimity. A number of heralds and other officers on his staff in the Lyon office declared on the side of the Jacobites during the rising, but Brodie used his influence to save them from government vengeance&#151;including, in one instance, obtaining for one of the clerks a pardon from sentence of death; in 1749 he secured the restoration of their salaries.<br>
<br>In the 1747 parliament, in which Caithness was not represented, Brodie sat for Inverness burghs under a scheme drawn up by Henry Pelham to prevent contests between government supporters in Scotland. He died of a heart complaint in London on 9 March 1754. His body was embalmed and carried north for burial at Dyke, close to the family seat at Brodie House.<br>
