<span class="headword">Gizycka, Countess Krystyna</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Countess Krystyna Skarbeka; <em>alias </em>Christine Granville]</span>  (1915&#150;1952), <span class="occ">special operations officer</span>, was born on 1 May 1915, probably at Mlodziesyn, some 30 miles from Warsaw, Poland. Her father, Count Jerzy Skarbek, had married in 1899 Stephanie Goldfeder, daughter of a Jewish banker, and they already had a son. The estate was soon overrun by the German army, and her infancy was spent under German occupation. In 1920 the family moved to another estate, at Trzebnica, near Piotrk&oacute;w, where she learned to ride; she later learned to ski. &#145;She was recalcitrant to any form of discipline&#146;  (Masson, 9). In 1930 her father died of tuberculosis; her mother moved to Warsaw and let Krystyna leave her convent school to work as a clerk for a motor dealer. She had dark hair, small bones, and graceful movement. She was a boisterous teenager, who hated office work and was strongly attractive to young men. She liked to spend holidays round Zakopane, on the Czechoslovak border, skiing, and smuggling tobacco for fun. In 1933 she was briefly and unsuccessfully married to Karol Getlich, a wealthy Polish businessman of German origin; they divorced promptly by mutual consent.<br>
<br>By accident, Krystyna met on a skiing slope near Zakopane a Polish diplomat, Jerzy Gizycki, who was captivated by her, and married her in Warsaw on 2 November 1938. He took up a post as consul in Addis Ababa, and introduced Krystyna to Africa; but that marriage too soon became one of incompatibles. On hearing of the German invasion of Poland in 1939 they at once moved to London, and Krystyna was engaged that autumn by George Taylor as an agent for the British secret service. From that time onwards she was known as Christine Granville. She travelled to Budapest, whence she set out to cross Slovakia into Poland, intending to deliver leaflets to sustain the morale of the Poles. She made three journeys into Poland that winter, and once got as far as Warsaw; she returned with several Polish officers who wanted to continue fighting, and with valuable information. Her friendships with the locals made these crossings feasible; but they seemed suspicious both to the Polish and to the British secret authorities. The Polish government in exile asked the British not to employ her again. She failed to persuade her mother to leave Poland, and never saw her again; Countess Skarbeka was later murdered by the Nazis.<br>
<br>While in Budapest, Christine renewed friendship with an acquaintance of her gentry childhood, Andrzeij Kowerski (called Andrew Kennedy later, in the Special Operations Executive, or SOE). They became strongly attached to each other, and travelled together to Constantinople, later to Cairo. Though devoted to him, she detested housework and preferred living in single rooms in hotels, and eating in caf&eacute;s, to keeping house. Eventually (1 August 1946) she divorced Gizycki, who had settled in Canada.<br>
<br>SOE found both her and Kennedy office jobs, successively in Constantinople and in Cairo. Entirely fluent in French from childhood, she was accepted as an agent by AMF section of SOE, which worked from Algiers, and parachuted into France on 6&#150;7 July 1944 to act as courier to Francis Cammaerts (&#145;Roger&#146;), who was in charge of all subversive activities east of the Rh&ocirc;ne. She arrived just in time to be at Cammaerts's elbow during the fighting in the Vercors in mid-July, and evaded capture with him&#151;by marching 70 miles in twenty-four hours&#151;when the Germans reconquered the plateau. She next crossed into Italy, beyond Brian&ccedil;on, and made contact with a band of Italian partisans in the Alps; then, at the Col de Larche farther south, she talked a unit of Polish conscripts in the Wehrmacht into changing sides.<br>
<br>On 13 August, at a chance road control, Cammaerts, his other courier, Xan Fielding, and a Gaullist officer called Sorensen were arrested and imprisoned in Digne. Christine, bold as brass, called on Max Waem, a Belgian, the local Gestapo interpreter, indicated what would happen to him if he did not release the prisoners promptly, secured (by parachute from Algiers) a bribe of 2 million francs and on 17 August drove Waem and all three prisoners away into the country. Waem was saved from any prosecution. For this feat she was awarded a George Medal by the British and a Croix de Guerre by the French. She was also commissioned into the Women's Auxiliary Air Force; but plans to parachute her back to Poland were cancelled. She was appointed OBE instead.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Christine quarrelled with Kennedy and drifted from job to job, mainly in London, sometimes in Kenya; always short of money. She was granted British citizenship on 23 November 1946. She settled in May 1951 to be a stewardess on Shaw Savill liners plying to Australia. On her first liner she met a sailor, Dennis George Muldowney, whose advances she resisted. He pursued her closely, even when she switched to the Union Castle Line, and in a frenzy knifed her to death in the hall of a small hotel in South Kensington on 15 June 1952. He was hanged ten weeks later. She was buried in St Mary's Catholic cemetery, Kensal Green.<br>
