<span class="headword">NicDh&ograve;mhnaill <span class="st"> [MacDonald]</span>,  S&igrave;leas</span> <span class="st"> [S&igrave;leas nighean Mhic Raghnaill]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1660&#150;<em>c.</em>1729), <span class="occ">Scottish Gaelic poet</span>, was daughter of Gilleasbaig (<i>d</i>. 1682), chief of the MacDonalds of Keppoch in Lochaber (Mac Mhic Raghnaill), and his wife, who has been identified as Mary MacMartin of the Letterfinlay family. S&igrave;leas was thus a sister of Colla nam B&ograve;, the next Mac Mhic Raghnaill (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1723). She was married in 1685 to Alexander Gordon of Camdell (<i>d</i>. 1720), near Tomintoul in Banffshire, who was factor for the Lochaber lands of the Gordons of Huntly. She doubtless went to live in Gordon country then and in 1700 they acquired Beldorney Castle, near Dufftown. It seems clear that by her marriage S&igrave;leas was able to maintain a social standing consistent with her aristocratic highland origin. There were at least five sons and three daughters of the marriage. S&igrave;leas is perhaps best known as the Gaelic poet of the Jacobite rising of 1715, and from her extant corpus of twenty-three songs (they are not mere poems) six are primarily concerned with that event, but she has probably attracted some spurious ascriptions, since all of her extant works have depended, to various extents, on the oral tradition for survival. Some of the six (and of the twenty-three) may therefore not be her work at all, so that she cannot really be called a political poet. Instead it is likely that her high social standing and her eastern location, together with the passage of time, all helped her to develop as a new kind of songmaker in Gaelic, one not thematically limited to &#145;Clan and politics&#146;, D. S. Thomson's classic markers for the work of the seventeenth-century Gaelic poets  (Thomson, &#145;Clan and politics&#146;, 116). Her songs, as far as is known, all date from after 1700 and her range of themes is notably wider than that of her predecessors. While she does not expand into nature poetry or love poetry (these were to flourish famously in Gaelic after her death), she does bring much that is new to the song tradition, including religious song, very much in the Roman Catholic dogmatic mould, and related comment on sexual mores. Her political songs on the 'Fifteen do reflect the simple Jacobite view one expects from MacDonald poets, and the presence of old conventions is clear to see. But a new extension of the idea of song as <i>brosnachadh</i>, incitement to battle, arises among Gaelic poets as the 1715 campaign gets under way. That is when the type of song sometimes called &#145;Oran nam fineachan Gaidhealach&#146; (&#145;the song of the highland clans&#146;) is first found, which some scholars see as a development of the age-old practice of listing a heroic subject's potential allies (Thomson, &#145;Political poetry&#146;, 192; MacInnes, 465). Songs of this new type are essentially lists of the main clans who might be expected to fight for the Stewarts, and as popular songs they could doubtless put heavy pressure on hesitant chiefs to lead their men out for James VIII (James Stuart). Both S&igrave;leas and another MacDonald poet, Iain Dubh, composed rousing songs of this type for the 'Fifteen, so neither poet can really be credited with inventing the genre.<br>
<br>S&igrave;leas makes a major contribution to the vast body of Gaelic encomium with her famous and popular song lamenting the death of Alasdair Dubh, the Glengarry chief, late in 1721. Even here, in this heroic lament where the hero is likened to the noblest of animals, the most valuable of stones, and the trees that were traditionally respected by Gaels, there are personal touches that show that S&igrave;leas knew the man and loved him. Personal touches feature in other songs, as where she delights in her children or laments the deaths in 1720 of both her husband and daughter and, a little later, of a harper who had visited her house regularly, bringing music and news of her family in the west. It is probably in these more personal poems, for which she had few identifiable models in the heroic public poetry of her predecessors, that the modern reader will find her most approachable. Almost nothing is known of S&igrave;leas's life after her husband's death, and that shortage of information may partly explain a number of traditions which have persisted about her religious life, including vaguely sinister trances and conversions. All that can really be said is that, while her death has been placed about 1729 on very little evidence, it is quite likely that she was buried at the ancient church of Mortlach, near Dufftown, where one of her songs relates that her husband was buried.<br>
