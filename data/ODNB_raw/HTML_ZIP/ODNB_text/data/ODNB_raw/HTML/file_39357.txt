<span class="headword">Seddon,  John Pollard</span>  (1827&#150;1906), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 19 September 1827 at London House, 150 Aldersgate Street, London, the third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39355/', "Thomas Seddon (bap. 1793, d. 1864)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67865/', "Seddon family")</script>] and Frances Nelson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1800&#150;1880) and great-grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39354/', "George Seddon (c.1727&#150;1801)")</script>, furniture maker [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67865/', "Seddon family")</script>]. His elder brother was the landscape painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25010/', "Thomas Seddon (1821&#150;1856)")</script>, whose friendships with W. H. Hunt and F. M. Brown prompted Seddon's collaboration with Pre-Raphaelites on a variety of works in the 1850s and 1860s, for example Rossetti's reredos for Llandaff Cathedral. After attending Bedford grammar school Seddon was articled in 1847 to T. L. Donaldson, and in the same year joined the Architectural Association as a founder member; he served as honorary secretary in 1850&#150;51. Despite Donaldson's neo-classicism Seddon was seduced in 1849 by Ruskin's <span class="italic">Seven Lamps of Architecture</span>, and was quickly converted to the philosophy of the Gothic revival, staunchly maintaining throughout his long career that Gothic was the only true Christian art, &#145;most scientific and beautiful, and most in accordance with common sense&#146;  (&#145;Ancient and modern ornament contrasted&#146;, <span class="italic">Building News</span>, 29 Jan 1858, 109&#150;12). In 1852, while building a small hotel in Southerndown, Glamorgan, he met John Prichard, diocesan architect of Llandaff, who offered him a partnership in 1853. The arrangement lasted until 1863, with Seddon largely responsible for the Monmouthshire jobs. Following an acclaimed competitive entry for the War and Foreign offices, Seddon established in 1858 the partnership's Whitehall office, through which he gained greater individual exposure. He was elected fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) on 5 March 1860, and repeatedly elected honorary secretary between 1862 and 1871. On 12 May 1864 he married Margaret Barber (1836&#150;1910) of Brighouse, Yorkshire, with whom he had three children, Maud, Hugh, and Katherine.<br>
<br>Seddon's architectural practice flourished in the 1860s and early 1870s. Significant secular designs included University College, Aberystwyth (1864&#150;86), an entry in a law courts competition (1866), and the speculative bungalow development of Birchington-on-Sea, Kent (1880&#150;82). But Seddon was essentially an ecclesiastical architect, and he built churches at Chigwell Row, Essex (1865&#150;7), Great Yarmouth (St James's, 1869&#150;78), Ullenhall, Warwickshire, and Ayot St Peter, Hertfordshire (1874&#150;5), and Hoarwithy, Herefordshire (<i>c</i>.1872&#150;85). He restored many medieval churches, notably St Nicholas's, Great Yarmouth (1863&#150;77), Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire (1867&#150;80), and Grosmont, Monmouthshire (1869&#150;75), but disdained the sentimentality of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. In 1884 he took John Coates Carter into partnership, and continued to work in his later years, primarily on ecclesiastical commissions, and greatly assisted by Carter; the Stroud School of Art and Sciences (1890&#150;99), with W. M. C. Fisher, was an important exception. Seddon designed numerous church fittings, including some for Llandaff, and several splendid pieces were made by the family firm for the 1862 International Exhibition. He was also a prolific designer of stained glass and mosaic, the east window of Sunningwell church, Berkshire (1877), and the pulpit at Betchworth, Surrey (1885), being notable examples. Seddon wrote numerous articles and gave frequent lectures. His incisive wit was notorious: he once publicly ridiculed some of his contemporaries as creators of the <i>hair-stand-on-end-style</i>  (&#145;Sundry notes upon some miscellaneous subjects&#146;, <span class="italic">RIBA Transactions</span>, 1863&#150;4, xxiii). He published several books, including <span class="italic">Progress in Art and Architecture with Precedents for Ornament</span> (1852), <span class="italic">Memoir and Letters of the Late Thomas Seddon, Artist</span> (1858), and <span class="italic">Rambles in the Rhine Provinces</span> (1867). Seddon died in St Thomas's Nursing Home, London, on 1 February 1906 and was buried four days later in Fulham cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
