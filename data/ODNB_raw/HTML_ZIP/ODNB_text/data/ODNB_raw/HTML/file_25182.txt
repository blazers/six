<span class="headword">Seymour,  William</span>, first marquess of Hertford and second duke of Somerset  (1587&#150;1660), <span class="occ">politician and royalist army officer</span>, was born on 1 September 1587, the second but eldest surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25160/', "Edward Seymour, Lord Beauchamp (1561&#150;1612)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25161/', "Seymour, Edward, first earl of Hertford")</script>], and his wife, Honora Rogers. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 16 April 1605 and graduated BA on 9 December 1607. He was later created MA (31 August 1636) and DM (12 August 1645).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsmarriagesandrelationswiththecourt"></a>Early years: marriages and relations with the court</h2>For much of the early Stuart period Seymour's relations with the royal court were somewhat strained. His illicit marriage on 22 June 1610 to James I's cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/601/', "Lady Arabella Stuart (1575&#150;1615)")</script> incurred the king's intense displeasure on the grounds that the two parties were cousins, and both had a (remote) claim to the throne. As a result they were imprisoned in the following month, Lady Arabella at Lambeth and Seymour in the Tower. Through the efforts of Lady Arabella's aunt the countess of Shrewsbury they both succeeded in escaping on 3&#150;4 June 1611. However, Lady Arabella was recaptured and confined to the Tower until she died on 27 September 1615, while Seymour, who had managed to flee across the channel, remained in exile until January 1616. His appointment to the Order of the Bath the following November heralded his rehabilitation at court, but the memory of this scandal seemed to dog him, and his offices and honours remained meagre thereafter.<br>
<br>Seymour was elected MP for Marlborough in December 1620, but succeeded his grandfather as second earl of Hertford in the following April. In 1624, although the prince of Wales helped restore him temporarily to favour, Hertford attended the Lords only once, and there is no record that he spoke. He was granted leave of absence from the 1625 parliament, and attended none of its sittings. In 1626, however, he served as chairman of the Lords' committee for privileges which defended the earls of Arundel and Bristol against Charles I's attempts to exclude them. Throughout the 1628 parliament Hertford consistently opposed Buckingham's efforts to introduce a saving clause into the petition of right, and became widely perceived as one of the duke's enemies.<br>
<br>This political alignment may have owed something to Hertford's second marriage, in April 1618, to Lady Frances Devereux (1599&#150;1674), sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7566/', "Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex")</script>. Hertford was very friendly with his brother-in-law, another peer marginalized from the court, and in July 1629 wrote warmly to Essex of &#145;two soe nearly linked in frendship and alliance as wee are&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 46188, fol. 114<i>r</i>). During the 1630s Essex regularly visited Hertford's Wiltshire houses, supported him in a duel in May 1636, and leased part of Essex House to him for ninety-nine years in return for &pound;1100. Throughout Charles I's personal rule Hertford remained detached from the court: Clarendon later wrote that he:<blockquote>had always undergone hard measure from the Court, where he received no countenance, and had no design of making advantage from it. For though he was a man of very good parts, and conversant in books both in Latin and Greek languages, and of a clear courage &hellip; he was so wholly given up to a country life, where he lived in splendour, that he had an aversion, even an unaptness, for business. (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.528&#150;9)</blockquote>Few offices came his way: only belatedly, on 23 March 1639, was he appointed lord lieutenant of Somerset, and then solely because the earl of Pembroke was otherwise engaged in the first of Charles's campaigns against the Scottish covenanters.<h2>
<a name="Themakingofaroyalist"></a>The making of a royalist</h2>In August 1640 Hertford, like Essex, was among the signatories of the twelve peers' petition urging the king to recall parliament. During the first half of 1641 Charles I sought a rapprochement with several of the twelve peers, and as part of this process Hertford was created a privy councillor (19 February), elevated to the rank of marquess (3 June), and appointed governor to the prince of Wales (10 August). According to Clarendon, from this point onwards Hertford rallied to &#145;the support and defence of the King's power and dignity, notwithstanding all his allies and those with whom he had the greatest familiarity and friendship were of the opposite party&#146;, and he accepted the position of governor to the prince of Wales out of &#145;pure zeal and affection for the Crown, and the conscience that in this conjuncture his submission might advance the King's service&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 1.563&#150;4). Hertford absented himself from the crucial vote on Strafford's attainder on 7 May, and in December he presented a petition from Somerset to the Lords in defence of episcopacy and the prayer book. As civil war approached, his role as governor to the prince of Wales became politically more sensitive, and on 14 January 1642 the two houses of parliament ordered him to ensure that the prince &#145;bee not carried out of the kingdome&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 4.513). He politely declined to give such an undertaking, and also refused to accept the lord lieutenancy of Somerset under the terms of the militia ordinance. In April he joined the king at York, together with the prince of Wales and the duke of York, and ignored parliamentary orders to return.<br>
<br>Hertford's refusal to be cowed by the houses reflected his growing political stature by the early 1640s, and he remained prominent in royalist counsels throughout the years of civil war. Like a number of other constitutional royalists, including his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25166/', "Francis Seymour")</script>, his allegiance to the king was not necessarily inconsistent with his earlier history of constitutional &#145;opposition&#146;, notably to the &#145;saving clause&#146; in the petition of right. The common denominator of both was a consistent commitment to the rule of law and constitutional propriety. Hertford sought to defend these ideals against whoever appeared to pose the greatest threat to them, be it Charles and Buckingham in the later 1620s or the crown's leading parliamentary critics by 1641&#150;2. As the civil war approached, Hertford came to regard the crown as the lesser of two evils, but during the years that followed he pursued a negotiated settlement and avoided the more hardline strand of royalism.<h2>
<a name="Civilwar"></a>Civil war</h2>On 2 August 1642 Hertford was appointed one of the commissioners of array for Somerset, and also lieutenant-general of the south-west and of south Wales. During September, concerted parliamentarian resistance in Somerset obliged him to withdraw his forces into south Wales, where he raised some 2000 men. From there he joined the king at Oxford in January 1643, and then, with Prince Maurice, advanced into Somerset, taking Taunton, Bridgwater, and Dunster Castle. He linked up with Sir Ralph Hopton at Chard on 4 June and they defeated Sir William Waller's forces at Lansdown on 5 July. Hertford then joined up with Prince Rupert to take Bristol on 26 July.<br>
<br>After this successful campaign, growing disputes between Hertford and princes Rupert and Maurice led the king to recall the marquess to Oxford, where he was appointed groom of the stole in January 1644. Hertford occupied rooms in Christ Church, and on 31 October 1643 he was elected chancellor of Oxford University, an office which he held until the visitation of the university by parliamentarian commissioners in the summer of 1647. Throughout the civil wars, Hertford was committed to seeking an accommodation between the king and the houses, and he remained in informal contact with his brother-in-law Essex. For example, during the summer of 1644, shortly before the parliamentarian surrender of Lostwithiel, the king's message to Essex was conveyed by Hertford's son Lord Beauchamp, who was also Essex's nephew. Similarly, Essex's refusal to negotiate without the houses' express permission was related by John Richard, one of Hertford's clients. Hertford was one of the royalist commissioners at the treaty of Uxbridge (January&#150;February 1645), and the following May he was among the commissioners entrusted with the city and university of Oxford during the king's absence on campaign. In December, Hertford, along with the earls of Dorset, Southampton, and Lindsey, again urged Charles to resume negotiations, but the king retorted that he would defend his crown &#145;with his sword, if those of his friends failed him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diplomatic Correspondence of Jean de Montereul</span>, ed. J. G. Fotheringham, 2 vols., Scottish RS, 29&#150;30, 1898&#150;9, 1.70&#150;71). In late April 1646 Hertford and several other royalist peers made a final abortive attempt to reach agreement with the parliamentary army at Woodstock, and on 20 June he was among the signatories of the Oxford articles of surrender.<br>
<br>The following autumn, Hertford begged to compound under the Oxford articles at the rate of one-tenth, or the value of two years' income from his estates. His composition fine was set at &pound;12,603 6<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. on 21 November 1646, but was subsequently reduced to &pound;8345 in January 1648 because part of his estate was held only for life; there is, however, no firm evidence that the fine was ever paid. In October 1647 Hertford was one of a small circle of royalist peers whom the king summoned to Hampton Court to advise him, and in the autumn of the following year he served as one of the king's commissioners at the treaty of Newport. As late as 12 January 1649 Hertford joined with Richmond, Dorset, &#145;and divers others of the King's party&#146; in sending &#145;to the Councell of the Army to engage both their persons and estates that the King shall performe whatsoever he yeilds unto&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Clarendon 34, fol. 74<i>r</i>). But this initiative came to nothing, and its failure opened the way to the king's trial, which began on 20 January. Along with Richmond, Southampton, and Lindsey, Hertford remained with Charles during his trial, and on 8 February these four peers acted as pallbearers at the king's funeral at Windsor.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearswithdrawal"></a>Later years: withdrawal</h2>Hertford owned extensive lands, especially in Somerset and Wiltshire, and his importance as a territorial magnate helps to explain why the council of state kept him under close observation during the early years of the interregnum. In July 1650 he was ordered to remain at his seat at Netley, while the following year he was instructed to move to another house in Wiltshire. He was also told to prevent the resort of &#145;many dangerous and disaffected persons&#146; to his house, and to &#145;give security for his acting nothing prejudiciall to the Commonwealth&#146; (TNA: PRO, SP 25/65, p. 108; SP 25/96, pp. 48&#150;9). Although Hertford himself avoided direct involvement in royalist conspiracy, his eldest son, Lord Beauchamp, took command of the western association, formed in May 1650, and developed an extensive network throughout western England. However, the association was soon infiltrated by government agents, and in April 1651 Beauchamp was imprisoned in the Tower. Hertford, who was the great-grandson of Edward VI's protector Somerset, observed wryly that it seemed the Tower was:<blockquote>a place entailed upon our famylie, for wee have now helde it five generations, yeat toe speake the truth I like not the place soe well but that I coulde be very well contented the entayle should be cutt off and settled upon some other familie that better deserves it. (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 2.47)</blockquote>Beauchamp was released in September 1651, but within two years his health failed, and he died in March 1654 to the great distress not only of his family but also of the exiled royalist court.<br>
<br>Although Hertford had some contact with John Penruddock, he kept his distance from the rising of March 1655, and Major-General Desborough found that the marquess had &#145;little stomach to meddle&#146; in royalist conspiracy  (A. A. Locke, <span class="italic">The Seymour Family</span>, 1911, 138). Hertford's desire to live quietly and avoid an open confrontation with the regime was further evident in his readiness to pay &pound;515 towards the decimation tax in May 1656; Cromwell reciprocated by granting him a personal exemption. Hertford nevertheless wished to keep the lord protector at arm's length. When Cromwell invited him to dinner, and sought &#145;his advice what to do&#146;, Hertford replied frankly: &#145;Our young Master, that is abroad, that is, my Master, and the Master of us all, restore him to his crownes, and by doing this, you may have what you please.&#146; Cromwell responded that &#145;hee had gone so farre, that the young gentleman could not forgive&#146;. Hertford's secretary recorded that they then parted &#145;and the Marquis had never any prejudice hereby so long as Cromwel lived&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32093, fol. 348<i>r</i>&#150;348<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>From the mid-1650s onwards Hertford lived more and more quietly. By 1652 his total debts probably stood at about &pound;19,000, and he was twice reported to have gone abroad in 1656&#150;7 in order to escape his creditors. His wife increasingly took over the management of the Seymour estates, taking policy decisions and corresponding with stewards. Hertford was nevertheless an active patron of distressed clergy during the interregnum and a number of ministers received regular payments from the marquess and his wife. He remained deeply reluctant to join in any royalist activism, convinced that a premature insurrection would only jeopardize the Stuart restoration which he always believed would eventually occur.<br>
<br>Hertford's prognosis proved correct, and on 26 May 1660 he was among the peers who welcomed Charles II at Dover. The same day he was restored to his office as chancellor of Oxford University, and the following day he was appointed a knight of the Garter. On 13 September he was restored to the dukedom of Somerset by a private act of parliament  (House of Lords RO, 12 Chas. II, Original Act 10). In giving his assent, Charles declared that this was an honour &#145;of an extraordinary nature &hellip; for an extraordinary person, who hath merited as much of the King my father and myself as a subject can do&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 11.173). By this time, however, his health was declining and he died at Essex House on 24 October 1660. He was buried on 1 November at Bedwyn Magna church in Wiltshire. His widow lived on until 24 April 1674 and was buried, also at Bedwyn Magna, on 7 May.<br>
