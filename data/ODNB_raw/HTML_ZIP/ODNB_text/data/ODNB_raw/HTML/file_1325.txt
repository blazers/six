<span class="headword">Barber,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1784, <em>d.</em> 1854), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was baptized on 28 January 1784 at St Martin, Birmingham, one of the sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1331/', "Joseph Barber (1757&#150;1811)")</script>, landscape painter, and his wife, Elizabeth. Charles attended his father's art school, where he was a fellow pupil of the watercolour landscape painter David Cox (1783&#150;1859), with whom he formed a long friendship. Barber was one of the founders of the first Society of Birmingham Artists in 1809, which developed into the Birmingham Academy of Arts. By 1818 he was working in Liverpool as a drawing-master and was exhibiting at the Liverpool Academy by 1822. He was intimately connected with the various associations established in Liverpool in his lifetime. He was among the earliest members and most frequent contributors of the Literary and Philosophical Society, and helped to found the Architectural and Archaeological Association. Thomas Rickman found much support and encouragement from him in his early studies of Gothic architecture, and for years his house was the centre of the intellectual society of Liverpool. He also maintained close contacts with the Birmingham Society of Arts, exhibiting nine works there from 1829 to 1851.<br>
<br>As a landscape painter Barber was a close observer of nature, and endeavoured to reproduce effects of mist and sunshine with accuracy. He exhibited three times in the Royal Academy, and was a regular contributor to local exhibitions. His painting <span class="italic">Dovedale, Derbyshire</span>, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1829, is now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. In spite of a severe attack of paralysis, he continued to practise his art to the end, and his two best-known pictures, <span class="italic">Evening after Rain</span> (exh. RA, 1849) and <span class="italic">The Dawn of Day</span> (exh. RA, 1849), were exhibited in Trafalgar Square at the Royal Academy in 1849. He was elected president of the Liverpool Academy some years before his death at his home, 4 Olive Mount, Wavertree, Liverpool, on 4 January 1854 and was buried at St Philip's, Liverpool. He was survived by his wife, Bell (1797/8&#150;1865), with whom he had at least three sons and three daughters. Birmingham City Art Gallery holds fifty-six of his paintings and forty-six drawings.<br>
