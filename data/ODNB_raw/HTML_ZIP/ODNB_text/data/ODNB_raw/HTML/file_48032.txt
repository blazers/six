<span class="headword">Cotesworth,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1668&#150;1726), <span class="occ">merchant and industrialist</span>, was born the second surviving son of Charles Cotesworth (1637&#150;1687) of Eggleston, co. Durham, a yeoman farmer, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1712). His eldest brother, Charles, remained on the land while Cotesworth himself was apprenticed in March 1683 to a prosperous Gateshead merchant and tallow chandler who died three years later, leaving his trade in the hands of his widow and inexperienced son. The bright young apprentice seemed to provide a welcome addition to the weakened firm and he was soon brought into partnership, paying only a token &pound;20 towards the joint capital. On 9 May 1699 he married his partner's sister-in-law, Hannah Ramsay (1673&#150;1710), and gained in prosperity with the passing years, allegedly by milking the partnership's capital to finance his private business ventures. Whatever the truth of this allegation, it is beyond question that the breakup of the firm in 1706 left him able to establish a successful independent business and to enter the capital-intensive salt and coal industries, while the fortunes of his former partner steadily declined.<br>
<br>Over the next few years Cotesworth's standing in the area grew rapidly, particularly through his friendship with the Liddell family of Ravensworth Castle in co. Durham, and through his activities as principal agent of the Regulation, a cartel formed in 1708 by several of the principal mine owners of the Tyne valley. His spectacular business success and increasing influence aroused resentment since they were felt to be out of keeping with his relatively humble background; and this resentment intensified when in 1712 he persuaded his wealthy brother-in-law, William Ramsay, to buy the strategically placed manors of Gateshead and Whickham, south of the Tyne. Cotesworth exploited this purchase to regulate the amount of coal coming onto the market from the new collieries south and west of Ramsay's estate, a policy that dragged his reluctant relative into open and often violent confrontation with the owners of these collieries. Meanwhile, his active loyalty to the Hanoverian government made him more enemies in an area where political divisions were deep and bitter. In 1715 the transformation from impoverished apprentice to landed gentleman was completed when Ramsay died, childless, leaving Cotesworth the bulk of his estate. He became a JP and, four years later, was appointed high sheriff of Northumberland. By this time he had retired from trade to concentrate on his extensive investments in land and industry, which by the early 1720s were estimated to yield a total annual income of more than &pound;8000&#151;a remarkably successful return on his original stake of &pound;20. The satisfaction which he presumably felt in surveying his expanding business empire from his country house on the outskirts of Gateshead was nevertheless marred, by the deaths of his wife (1710) and of four of their seven children.<br>
<br>The years which marked the peak of Cotesworth's success, however, were also those in which he began to encounter difficulties in his &#145;great concerns&#146;; thereafter he was forced to fight hard to keep his head above water, let alone advance any further. The last five or six years of his life were spent in a constant battle against illness as well as against enemies anxious to deprive him of the fruits of his success. In 1725 he survived an assassination attempt allegedly instigated by one of his bitterest rivals. His aggressive self-righteousness undoubtedly played a part in sowing the whirlwind that he was to reap in the 1720s, but other factors working against him were outside his control and might well have had similar effects on the careers of less belligerent men. In attempting to break into a high-risk, capital-intensive, and aristocratically dominated industry like coal, Cotesworth characteristically overreached himself, and the difficulties he encountered so overwhelmed him that he left his only surviving son, Robert (1702&#150;1729), a muddled and encumbered inheritance. His achievements, however, should not be underestimated: in his final years he was the driving force behind the so-called &#145;grand alliance&#146; which dominated the Newcastle coal industry for another hundred years and, despite the financial burdens imposed by protracted lawsuits, he was able to leave his heirs a respected position in society and a landed estate valued at &pound;60,000.<br>
<br>William Cotesworth died after a long and painful illness and was buried on 15 December 1726 at St Mary's parish church at Gateshead. His will contained a final surprise: a codicil revealed to Robert Cotesworth and his sisters, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1701) and Hannah (1706&#150;1787), that in 1722 or 1723 their father had married his housekeeper, Hannah Watson (<i>d</i>. 1766). Their daughter, Henrietta (<i>c</i>.1723&#150;1781), who was reputedly very like her father, in 1760 became sub-governess of the royal nursery.<br>
