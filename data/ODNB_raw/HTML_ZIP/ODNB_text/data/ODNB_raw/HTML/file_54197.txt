<span class="headword">Mullins,  Claud William</span>  (1887&#150;1968), <span class="occ">lawyer and writer</span>, was born on 6 September 1887 at 17 Southampton Street, London, the eldest of the four children (three sons and a daughter) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35146/', "Edwin Roscoe Mullins (1848&#150;1907)")</script>, sculptor, and his wife, Alice (1856&#150;<i>c</i>.1936), daughter of John Pelton JP, a successful Croydon grocer. His father's illness precipitated the young Mullins's withdrawal from Mill Hill School and, after a period travelling in Europe, he became a London county council clerk in 1907.<br>
<br>Dissatisfied with the limited intellectual stimulus afforded by his administrative duties, Mullins read for the bar and, having been awarded a certificate of honour in the bar finals, was called by Gray's Inn in 1913. His career was interrupted by war service, and thereafter he did not find it easy to build up a practice. He used his enforced leisure to express in books (notably <span class="italic">In Quest of Justice</span>, 1931) and articles a dissatisfaction, in part founded on his studies of foreign systems, with English law and procedure.<br>
<br>Mullins made no secret of his readiness to accept judicial office and was appointed a Metropolitan Police magistrate on 29 June 1931. He quickly formed strong views about the fact that disputes between husbands and wives under the <span class="roman">Summary Jurisdiction (Separation and Maintenance) Act</span> of 1925 were treated in the same way as prosecutions, heard before crowds of prurient onlookers, and fully reported in the local press. Mullins thought it wrong to regard matrimonial disputes solely as matters of law, and he believed magistrates ought to be trained in the causes of marital disharmony and thus enabled to dispense social help to those who came before them.<br>
<br>In an attempt to promote the radical changes he thought necessary, Mullins drafted the <span class="roman">Summary Jurisdiction (Domestic Procedure) Bill</span> which was introduced into the House of Lords in 1934 by the young Lord Listowel. Although the bill's more radical provisions (for example, giving magistrates' courts powers to hear &#145;conciliation summonses&#146; and to advise the spouses on matters detrimental to their happiness) were unacceptable to lawyers and administrators, the bill generated sufficient support to persuade the government that the magistrates' domestic jurisdiction ought to be investigated by the committee on social services in magistrates' courts (chaired by S. W. Harris). The resulting <span class="roman">Summary Procedure (Domestic Proceedings) Act</span> of 1937 gave effect to recommendations intended to humanize magistrates' domestic hearings, not least by separating them from the processing of criminal prosecutions.<br>
<br>Mullins was also largely instrumental in drawing public attention to the excessive use of imprisonment for debt and thus in influencing the decision to appoint the (Fischer Williams) departmental committee on imprisonment by courts of summary jurisdiction (1934). That committee's recommendations formed the basis of the <span class="roman">Money Payments (Justices' Procedure) Act</span> of 1935. This provided that those failing to pay fines, affiliation orders, or rates should not be sent to prison without inquiry into the reasons for failure to pay.<br>
<br>Mullins was justifiably proud of his part in bringing about these reforms, but his success was only partial. Indeed, the Harris committee specifically rejected his fundamental belief that &#145;conciliation&#146; in family disputes was a matter for the courts themselves. The clear distinction between adjudication on the one hand and social work on the other, drawn by the committee and subsequently consistently followed by orthodox opinion, was the antithesis of Mullins's beliefs. Mullins's attempts to secure for the magistrates an enhanced role in the reformed divorce law brought about by A. P. Herbert's <span class="roman">Matrimonial Causes Act</span> of 1937 were also unsuccessful.<br>
<br>From the outset Mullins's relationship with his magisterial brethren was uneasy and in 1936 the metropolitan magistrates, evidently vexed by what they believed to be Mullins' proclivity for self-advertisement, unanimously censured his conduct. The Home Office concluded that Mullins had done nothing prejudicial to the impartial administration of justice, but complaints (about ill-considered remarks about birth control, among other things) were made not only in private correspondence but on the floor of the House of Commons. In 1942 Herbert Morrison, less tolerant of Mullins's eccentricities than his predecessor, Sir John Simon, publicly rebuked Mullins.<br>
<br>In 1947 Mullins retired from the bench on grounds of ill health, and devoted the rest of his life to writing, lecturing, and voluntary work.<br>
<br>Mullins had married (Elizabeth) Gwendolen (1904&#150;1997), a craftswoman, younger daughter of Augustus Philip Brandt, banker, on 28 May 1925. They had one son (Edwin Brandt Mullins, a writer on artistic and other subjects) and two daughters (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/98642/', "Ann Dally")</script>, psychiatrist and medical historian, and Barbara Mullins, craftswoman). Mullins died, aged eighty-one, on 23 October 1968 at the Royal West Sussex Hospital, Chichester, Sussex. He was cremated and, after a funeral service at Graffham church, his ashes were scattered in the woods where he used to walk.<br>
<br>Mullins deserves to be remembered for his pioneering role in seeking to civilize the legal consequences of family breakdown and in helping to create a climate of opinion favourable to conciliation as a preferred alternative to litigation in such matters. As Sir Alexander Maxwell, the permanent under-secretary at the Home Office, put it to the home secretary on Mullins's retirement, &#145;with his egoism and assertiveness, [Mullins] has combined a very genuine zeal for improving the work of the Courts and for helping the numerous classes of unfortunate people with whom the Summary courts come into contact&#146;  (Maxwell to Chuter Ede, 3 Feb 1947, Home Office MSS, TNA: PRO, HO45/21034).<br>
