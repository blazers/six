<span class="headword">Hill,  John</span>  (1786&#150;1855), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 23 October 1786 in the City of London, apparently in the parish of St Gregory by Paul with St Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, the son of John Hill. His first instructor was probably John Eden, vicar of St Nicholas, Bristol, and his early diaries show that he was also influenced in boyhood by T. T. Biddulph of St James's, Bristol. From 1803 to 1806 he boarded at a school kept by Edward Spencer, vicar of Wingfield, Wiltshire, where other notable evangelicals were educated. Hill matriculated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1806, subsequently obtaining a second class below the line in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1809. Thereupon he was made assistant tutor, proceeding MA in 1812, when he became sole tutor and vice-principal (the principals of the Hall at this time played virtually no part in teaching or administration). During Hill's formative years at Oxford, until 1807, Isaac Crouch had been vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, followed by Daniel Wilson, afterwards bishop of Calcutta. Hill's significance in church and Oxford history can be adequately understood only in terms of his links with these two predecessors. Vice-principal from 1783, Crouch had brought into being, and Wilson continued more formally, a system of close academic teaching with constant pastoral oversight. Crouch established thus a thriving evangelical tradition at St Edmund Hall, which lasted until 1854. Hill promoted it effectively, considerably longer than Crouch, and for much longer than Wilson or his own successor, E. A. Litton, who looked back on Hill's &#145;pure simplicity of character and benevolence of spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Record</span>, 5 March 1855, 4). The hymnologist W. H. Havergal, an early pupil, &#145;often spoke &hellip; of his kindness and fitness for his office&#146;  (J. M. Crane, <span class="italic">Records of &hellip; Wm. H. Havergal</span>, 1882, 6). Soon this influence extended further afield in the university: Archdeacon Phelps, scholar of Corpus from 1815 to 1822, and his undergraduate associates recalled Hill's &#145;friendship and counsels&#146; long after they had all left Oxford  (C. Hole, <span class="italic">Life of W. W. Phelps</span>, 1, 1871, 130).<br>
<br>With entire responsibility for teaching and discipline, Hill had little time to produce original works of scholarship: during the long vacation of 1818 he wrote over 1000 pages of lectures. However his 1816 version of Henry Aldrich's <span class="italic">Artis logicae compendium</span> proved an acceptable university textbook, reaching a sixth edition in 1850. Apart from this he published only a lengthy poem, <span class="italic">The Boor</span> (1829), a scriptural analogy relating to Roman Catholic emancipation, and a few sermons. Made deacon in 1809 and ordained priest in 1810, Hill fulfilled his pastoral vocation both at the Hall and by officiating as curate of Hampton Gay, a small village near Oxford, becoming perpetual curate in 1814 and serving the parish until 1851. On 17 July 1811 at St George's, Hanover Square, London, Hill married Sophia (<i>c</i>.1788&#150;1849), only daughter of George Warriner, linen draper of New Bond Street and of Bloxham Grove, Oxfordshire, niece of Edward Grubb, sculptor. Their house in the High Street, Oxford (latterly no. 65), a focus for evangelicals from near and far, became the centre of an affectionate family life, where between 1812 and 1824 four sons (of whom two died young) and four daughters were born.<br>
<br>In 1825 Hill founded a local association (still extant) of the Church Missionary Society, followed in 1827 by a similar branch of the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. Of these he remained active secretary until he ceased to reside in the university. Among assistant secretaries, for a year in 1829&#150;30, was J. H. Newman, then vicar of St Mary's. By this time Hill was himself a recognized evangelical leader in Oxford. Francis Newman, then an undergraduate at Worcester College, recalled that &#145;to young Academicians of the <i>Evangelical</i> school, whatever their College, the Revd. Mr. <i>Hill</i> was an important standard-bearer&#146;  (C. H. O. Daniel, <span class="italic">Our Memories</span>, 1893, 46). Hill's pupils included a Bampton lecturer (J. E. Riddle), a Savilian professor (W. F. Donkin), and William Jacobson, afterwards regius professor of divinity (1848&#150;65) and bishop of Chester.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Gleanings of Past Years</span> (1879) W. E. Gladstone described Hill's men of about 1830 as ultra-Calvinistic. While this was undoubtedly true of a few contemporary Oxford evangelicals, including H. B. Bulteel (1800&#150;1866), curate of St Ebbe's, where Gladstone sometimes worshipped, it does not seem clear how far doctrinal Calvinism at St Edmund Hall, even in Hill's time, went beyond the moderate form of article 17, if at all. But Hill did, privately at least, identify himself with Bulteel. His quieter personality and genial temperament, however, made him a more sympathetic advocate of evangelical beliefs.<br>
<br>In 1840&#150;41 Hill's vice-principalship received the unusual recognition of a portrait, albeit by the minor artist John Wood, which now hangs in the old dining hall. Hill proceeded BD in 1844. During the later 1840s he felt less vigour for dealing effectively with young men. Numbers at St Edmund Hall were declining. To this period nevertheless belongs a reference of William Tuckwell, then an undergraduate of New College, recalling &#145;the evening parties of John Hill &hellip; where prevailed tea and coffee, pietistic Low Church talk, prayer and hymnody of portentous length&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reminiscences of Oxford</span>, 1900, 96).<br>
<br>The death of his wife in September 1849 was perhaps a decisive factor in Hill's decision to quit. Late in 1851 he was appointed by Charles Sumner, bishop of Winchester, as rector of Wyke Regis, Dorset. At the same time he was elected a city lecturer, requiring occasional duty in Oxford, at St Martin's, Carfax. Having made a promising start at Wyke, in 1855 serious illness intervened and he died at his rectory on 22 February. A mural tablet in Wyke church commemorates his ministry there and at Oxford, where he was buried on 2 March in his family vault in St Peter's-in-the-East churchyard. His surviving diaries were presented to St Edmund Hall by a great-grandson, the Revd A. D. du B. Hill, in 1925. Some twenty of Hill's letters, in a freer style, came to light in 1990.<br>
