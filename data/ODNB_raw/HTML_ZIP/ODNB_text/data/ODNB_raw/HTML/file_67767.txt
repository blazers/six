<span class="headword">Perkins <span class="st"> [Parkins]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1579&#150;1650), <span class="occ">actor</span>, gave his age in a legal deposition of 1623 as &#145;44 yeares, or therabouts&#146;, so that he was about twenty-three when his name first was recorded in Henslowe's <span class="italic">Diary</span> (September 1602) as a member of the theatrical company Worcester's Men. He remained with the same troupe when they became Queen Anne's Men in 1603, emerging as a leading player within the next decade, and acting principally at the Red Bull playhouse. He probably played the role of Flamineo in the first performance of Webster's <span class="italic">The White Devil</span> in 1612. Webster's epigraph to the published play speaks of Perkins as &#145;my freind&#146;, and praises his acting. In the same year Perkins also claimed the dramatist and actor Thomas Heywood as &#145;<i>my loving friend and fellow</i>&#146; in prefatory verses he contributed to Heywood's <span class="italic">An Apology for Actors</span>. Heywood was also a member of Queen Anne's Men, as was Christopher Beeston, with whom Perkins was to have a long professional relationship. Perkins was an overseer of and witness to the will of his senior colleague Thomas Greene in July 1612; with his fellows he received a pair of gloves as a memorial gift, as well as considerable problems ensuing from the share in the company inherited by Greene's widow. The troupe was already in some financial difficulty by the time of the queen's death in 1619, when it disbanded. Perkins and a number of other actors returned to the Red Bull from the Cockpit playhouse in Drury Lane, to which Queen Anne's Men had moved in the final two years of their existence, and performed there as the Players of the Revels.<br>
<br>Perkins lived in Clerkenwell, near to the Red Bull in the parish of St James, until at least the 1620s&#151;in 1623 at the northern end of St John's Street&#151;and he was living there at the end of his life. By 1620 he was married to a woman named Elizabeth, who gave evidence in that year in a law case in which he was involved; in March of the following year she died, and Perkins may have remarried on 5 November 1621, if the Richard Perkins who married Philadelphia Kelly in All Hallows, Lombard Street, was the actor.<br>
<br>In 1623 Perkins became a member of the King's Men, but for a brief period only: by late 1625 he had joined Queen Henrietta's Company, led by Christopher Beeston, at the Cockpit playhouse in Drury Lane. As a leading performer with this company for eleven years his roles included Barabas in a revival of Marlowe's <span class="italic">The Jew of Malta</span>, Sir John Belfare in Shirley's <span class="italic">The Wedding</span>, Fitzwater in Davenport's <span class="italic">King John and Matilda</span>, Captain Goodlack in Heywood's <span class="italic">The Fair Maid of the West</span>, and Hanno in Nabbes's <span class="italic">Hannibal and Scipio</span>; he would have taken principal roles in other plays by Heywood, Shirley, and Ford, among other leading dramatists in the company's repertory. Perkins's playing of Barabas is praised by Heywood in a prologue and epilogue written for the revival of the play in 1633, in which the actor is favourably compared with his famous predecessor in the role, Edward Alleyn. Perkins was undoubtedly the star actor at the Cockpit, one of the two principal London theatres in the 1630s, and a rival to the player Joseph Taylor at the Blackfriars. During 1636&#150;7 the company was disbanded, and Perkins was among a number of older actors who joined a new Queen Henrietta's Company, acting at the Salisbury Court playhouse from late 1637 until the cessation of playing five years later. With both generations of the company Perkins appeared frequently at court; he undoubtedly acted in the productions of Heywood's <span class="italic">Love's Mistress</span>, staged with scenery by Inigo Jones, presented before the king and queen at Somerset House in November 1634.<br>
<br>There was at least one Richard Perkins (or Parkins) living in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields from the mid-1620s until the mid-1640s, and it has been suggested that the actor may have moved to the district near the Cockpit playhouse. He appears to have married again, and buried children at St Giles. His presence there until the latter half of 1645 is further indicated by the bequest of a former colleague, the third player who remembered Perkins at his death. (In 1634 he was willed a mourning ring by his old fellow from Queen Anne's Men, Thomas Basse.) Michael Bowyer made his will in September 1645, leaving &#145;to my loveing frend mr Richard Perkins of St Giles in the feild<i>e</i>s London fyftie pound<i>e</i>s of currant English money to be payed unto him by fyve shilling<i>e</i>s a week, yf he shall soe long lyve&#146;  (Bentley, <span class="italic">Jacobean and Caroline Stage</span>, 2.635). Bowyer and Perkins had been chief actors with Queen Henrietta's Men from 1625 to 1636, and Perkins had stood surety for Bowyer when he joined the King's Men in 1637; he may indeed have lent Bowyer money, of which the bequest was a repayment rather than a gift.<br>
<br>By the time of the outbreak of war in England, Perkins was sixty-three, and it seems unlikely that he would have joined the king's army, as so many of his professional colleagues did. According to James Wright in <span class="italic">Historia histrionica</span> (1699) he spent his last years in Clerkenwell, sharing a house with his old acting colleague John Sumner, suggesting rather straitened circumstances, and that neither man had a family at the end of his life: &#145;Susan wife of Richard Parkins&#146; had been buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields in August 1645; Perkins himself was buried at St James's, Clerkenwell, on 20 April 1650.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Perkins's portrait was painted, an event which speaks of prosperity and a continuing position in the world rather than of hard times. The painting survives in the collection of the Dulwich Picture Gallery: it is a half-length on canvas (69.8cm &times; 61.9 cm), with the subject turned three-quarters to the left, his left hand resting on his breast. The painter belonged to the school of Gerard Soerst, who was active in London from the late 1640s, and who copied the style of Van Dyck. Perkins, in his late sixties, is shown in sober dress, with shoulder-length hair, and beard worn in a royalist style. He has a long, expressive face and commanding if rather mournful eyes. His hand is somewhat swollen with age, but is perhaps given prominence in the picture to demonstrate another chief medium of the sitter's art.<br>
