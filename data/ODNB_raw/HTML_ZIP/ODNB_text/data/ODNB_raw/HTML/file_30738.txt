<span class="headword">Baker,  James Franklin  Bethune-</span>  (1861&#150;1951), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born on 23 August 1861 in Birmingham, the third son of Alfred Baker, surgeon, and his wife, Emmeline Bethune, daughter of George Armitage. Charles Baker (1803&#150;1874), an instructor of deaf people, and Franklin Baker (1800&#150;1867), a Unitarian minister, were his uncles; his aunt was the mother of Archbishop E. W. Benson. In 1884 he assumed the additional name of Bethune.<br>
<br>Bethune-Baker was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and gained a classical scholarship at Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1884 he took a first class in part one, in 1885 a third class in part two of the classical tripos; in 1886 a first class in part two of the theological tripos. In 1886 he won the George Williams prize and submitted an unsuccessful (and so unpublished) essay for the Burney prize in which his later modernist theology is clearly foreshadowed; in 1887 he submitted a successful essay entitled &#145;The influence of Christianity on war&#146;, and in the following year won the Norrisian prize. In 1886 he returned to teach at King Edward's School; and in 1888, although an anxious request for reassurance of his orthodoxy came from the dean of Pembroke, E. J. Heriz Smith, he was ordained deacon, accepting a title at St George's, Edgbaston. He was ordained priest in the next year and in 1891 was elected to a fellowship at Pembroke, which he retained until his death. He was also made dean, an office to which in 1906 he was not reappointed in consequence of complaints concerning his attitude to biblical criticism. Thereafter, although continuing to attend college chapel regularly, he never again felt confident to preach there, except on the occasion of a memorial service for his friend A. J. Mason, master of Pembroke College and canon of Canterbury. Bethune-Baker married in 1891 Ethel (<i>d</i>. 1949), the daughter of Furneaux Jordan, a surgeon, of Birmingham, and they had one son, who died as a schoolboy at Marlborough.<br>
<br>Bethune-Baker proceeded BD in 1901 and DD in 1912. His scholarly reputation was established by <span class="italic">The Meaning of Homoousios in the Constantinopolitan Creed</span> (1901) and his <span class="italic">Introduction to the Early History of Christian Doctrine</span> (1903), which became a standard textbook. Through the Archbishop's Mission to Assyrian Christians a copy of a Syriac manuscript containing the <span class="italic">Bazaar of Heraclides</span> by Nestorius came into his hands; with the aid of a translation by Dom Richard Hugh Connolly (whose name did not appear on account of the papal anti-modernist decrees of 1907) he wrote <span class="italic">Nestorius and his Teaching</span> (1908), claiming that Nestorius did not hold the doctrines attributed to him and was wrongly condemned by the ecumenical council of Ephesus in 431. In 1911 he succeeded W. R. Inge as Lady Margaret professor. Except for his time-absorbing work as editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span> (1903&#150;35), by which he guided and maintained the standards of British theology for a generation, his interest now turned from personal contributions to learning and was more devoted to teaching in Cambridge and to the advancement of liberal Christianity. In 1913&#150;14 he became involved in the controversy concerning clerical orthodoxy in the Church of England. His open letter to Charles Gore, <span class="italic">The Miracle of Christianity</span> (1914), pleads for the logical consequences of the liberal view of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> adopted by Gore himself in <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span> (1889). This avowal of sympathy with the &#145;critical school&#146; led his friend Bishop J. R. Harmer of Rochester to request his resignation from the office of examining chaplain, which he had held since 1905; believing that hope lay only in the coexistence of conservative and modernist views he refused, and Harmer (who did not share this belief) relieved him of his post. The claim that the Anglican principle of comprehensiveness extended not only to the unity of Catholic and protestant but also to that of conservative and modernist he later expounded in <span class="italic">Unity and Truth in the Church of England</span> (1934). His dogmatic beliefs are best seen in <span class="italic">The Faith of the Apostles' Creed</span> (1918) and in a collection of essays, published at the suggestion of S. C. Roberts, <span class="italic">The Way of Modernism</span> (1927). He advocated an evolutionary, immanentist approach to the incarnation and free enquiry in historical criticism, rejecting as irreligious the view that the virgin birth and the resurrection are truths to be accepted on supernatural authority by all believers. He lacked the philosophical equipment to make these writings wholly successful, but their subject-matter was his deepest concern. He was examining chaplain (1924&#150;35) to Bishop E. W. Barnes, of whose <span class="italic">Rise of Christianity</span> (1947) he disapproved. He was elected FBA in 1924 and resigned his professorship in 1935. He took part in college meetings almost until the end of his life and still drove his car in his eighty-ninth year.<br>
<br>In the teaching of theology at Cambridge, Bethune-Baker played a leading part, encouraging in his pupils an attitude of detachment and impartiality. In 1922 he founded the Cambridge D Society for the discussion of philosophical and systematic theology. He had a keenly critical mind, a strong, sometimes obstinate personality, and a satirical tongue which enjoyed opposition and in some induced alarm. He had also a capacity for deep and generous friendship, and above all a profound concern for the presentation of the faith in a form tenable to the modern mind.<br>
<br>Bethune-Baker died in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 13 January 1951.<br>
