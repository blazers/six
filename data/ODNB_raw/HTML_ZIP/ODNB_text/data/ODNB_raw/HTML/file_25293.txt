<span class="headword">Sheffield,  Edmund</span>, first earl of Mulgrave  (1565&#150;1646), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 7 December 1565, the only son of John, second Baron Sheffield (<i>c</i>.1538&#150;1568), of Butterwick, Lincolnshire, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69742/', "Douglas Sheffield, Lady Sheffield (1542/3&#150;1608)")</script>, daughter of William Howard, first Lord Howard of Effingham. He inherited his father's title on 10 December 1568. Shortly after his father's death, his mother embarked upon a liaison with the earl of Leicester. She later claimed that a secret marriage occurred about 1571 and, although the evidence for this union is inconclusive, she did bear Leicester a son. In any event Leicester denied the existence of the bond when he married Lettice, countess of Essex, in 1578. Sheffield was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (1574&#150;9), and in 1582 Queen Elizabeth commanded him to accompany the duke of Anjou on his return voyage to the continent. In 1585 he served as a volunteer in the Netherlands. The approach of the Spanish Armada offered him further opportunities and he served as captain of three ships in the campaign: the <i>Victory</i>, <i>Dreadnaught</i>, and <i>White Bear</i>. His uncle Lord Admiral Howard knighted him for his service on 26 July 1588, and praised him in reports to the council.<br>
<br>Despite his heroics at sea and in the Netherlands, however, Sheffield's standing with the queen was threatened by suspicions about his religion. His wife, Ursula Tyrwhitt, of Kettleby, Lincolnshire, was a devout Catholic, and the two were married according to the Catholic rite some time before 13 November 1581. Success at court came only slowly. In 1591 the crown granted him the manor of Mulgrave in Yorkshire, and thereafter Sheffield gradually transferred his interests northward from Lincolnshire. In 1594 Sir Robert Carey reported that the queen refused to grant him the presidency of the Welsh marches because of his wife's religion. He demonstrated his allegiance by strenuously persecuting Catholics in his neighbourhood, winning praise from local authorities: &#145;My lord took great pains to give such testimony of his affection to religion as none of his coat have done&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 232). Catholics denounced him for his harshness and claimed that the untimely deaths of all six of his sons with Ursula was a divine judgment. Elizabeth honoured him with the Garter in April 1593, and in January 1599, after vigorous lobbying on his part, she appointed him governor of Brill in the Netherlands, a post he apparently never took up.<br>
<br>It was not until the accession of James I that Sheffield received the post he coveted most, the presidency of the council of the north; he had asked for the job as early as 1595 but Elizabeth had denied him. As a prelude James named him lord lieutenant of Yorkshire on 1 August 1603, and added the presidency on 19 September. Sheffield's good fortune did not satisfy him, however. The expenses of his office were high, and he had nine daughters to provide for. In 1604 he complained bitterly of his plight. In an audience with the king he lamented that James had &#145;repaired the ruins of every nobleman's estate in England except his&#146;. The king, irritated by Sheffield's petulance, offered him an annual pension of &pound;1000 which Sheffield said &#145;would do him no good&#146;, but James held firm, telling his suitor that &#145;my liberality ought not to be measured by his want, for I was bound to be no man's banker&#146;  (Akrigg, 242&#150;5). Eventually James relented and, before 1609, Sheffield received an interest in the Yorkshire alum mines, from which over the years he drew a substantial&#151;though always insufficient&#151;amount of money.<br>
<br>As lord president and, from 1616, vice-admiral of Yorkshire, Sheffield actively enforced the laws against recusants. In 1604 he presided over the indictment of 900 recusants at York assizes, and in later years was vigilant against what he perceived as the Catholic threat in the north. He did not always get along with his colleagues on the council; in 1609 charges were laid against him for &#145;arbitrary conduct and not consulting the other commissioners&#146;, though these seem to have come to nothing  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1603&#150;10</i>, 577). In any event, the heavy expenses of his office and his weak estate encouraged him to seek a buyer for the office by 1614. His tottering fortune was briefly shored up by the king's favour in 1615 when he collected the &pound;10,000 Sir Robert Dormer paid for his barony. He finally sold the lord presidency of the north to Lord Scrope in 1619, although he retained his vice-admiralty. He left office under a cloud, for the Spanish ambassador had complained about Sheffield's execution of a Catholic priest, though it seems likely that his money problems were a more important factor.<br>
<br>Sheffield's financial troubles were exacerbated by his colonial speculations; he was an early member of the Virginia Company and in succeeding years worked diligently to advance its fortunes, though with little success. He also invested in the New England Company, with similar results. Ursula had died some time before 4 August 1618 and after a fruitless search for a rich wife, in 1619, when he was sixty-four, Sheffield settled on Mariana (<i>c</i>.1603&#150;<i>c</i>.1676), the sixteen-year-old daughter of Sir William Irwin, a Scot maliciously (and inaccurately) described by John Chamberlain as &#145;a kind of dancing tutor to Prince Henry&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1619&#150;23</i>, 21). They were married on 4 March 1619. Although Irwin was a gentleman of Prince Henry's privy chamber, Anne Clifford described the match as &#145;very mean and &hellip; indiscreet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 102). Indiscreet or not, the couple had five children, further adding to Sheffield's financial woes. The alum monopoly which provided a large portion of his income was an unreliable source, and after 1620 he received little of the profits of office. He was estranged from the duke of Buckingham in the 1620s, but after his accession Charles I, on 5 February 1626, promoted him to earl of Mulgrave, possibly as a reward for his staunch support of the war against Spain.<br>
<br>Mulgrave grew increasingly alienated from the king, despite his new rank. In 1640 he refused to contribute an assessment of &pound;1 to the war effort against the Scots, alleging poverty. His financial situation was certainly grim, but his call for a parliament in August 1640 suggests that his resistance was founded on other grounds. When the civil war came he and his family sided with parliament; two of his sons served in parliament's army, and two daughters married into the family of the parliamentarian general Lord Fairfax. Because most of his property in the north remained in royalist hands throughout the war, from March 1645 parliament paid Mulgrave a weekly pension of &pound;50. His advanced age kept him from constant attendance in the House of Lords, but his proxy was a valuable commodity in the thinly attended chamber. Although at first in the hands of Lord Saye and Sele, in May 1646 he switched his allegiance to the presbyterian Essex, who held the earl's proxy thereafter. This was Mulgrave's final significant political act; he died at his home in Hammersmith, Middlesex, in October 1646, aged eighty-one, and was buried in the church he had founded there. He was succeeded by his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25294/', "Edmund Sheffield, second earl of Mulgrave")</script>.<br>
