<span class="headword">Jefferson,  Thomas</span>  (1732&#150;1807), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in a farm near Carthorpe in the North Riding of Yorkshire on 31 January 1732. After his mother's early death, instead of following his father into farming, he was articled to a Yorkshire attorney. Shortly before his fifteenth birthday he moved to London, probably still in the employ of an attorney, but was soon in thrall to the theatre. It is possible that David Garrick, having watched or heard of his amateur d&eacute;but at the Haymarket playhouse, advised him to work in the provincial theatre to prepare him for membership of the Drury Lane company, and it was probably while he was acting on the Kent circuit in 1751 that he met and married Elizabeth May, the daughter of an officer in the merchant navy. The bride's father's attempt to keep his daughter off the stage failed, and it was as a couple that the Jeffersons were engaged at Drury Lane for five seasons from October 1753. Their modest status is represented in his roles as Guildenstern in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, the duke of Burgundy in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and Count Paris in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and hers as Lady Macduff in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, but their reliability was appreciated by Garrick and the senior actors. It earned them, in 1758, an invitation to join Spranger Barry and Henry Woodward in a new theatrical enterprise in Dublin. They were lucky to get there. The <span class="italic">Dublin Trader</span>, in which they embarked on 27 October 1758, struck a sandbar, and the Jeffersons were among the passengers who elected to abandon ship. The few who remained on board included the actor Theophilus Cibber and the equilibrist Anthony Maddox: they were among the drowned when the ill-fated packet sank in a storm.<br>
<br>The Jeffersons acted in Dublin from 1758 until 1763, and may have toured in Ireland for a further year. They are next heard of in Exeter, where Jefferson entered into joint management of the theatre. He remained in management for the rest of his active life, and was particularly associated with the Plymouth circuit from 1765 to 1796, but he had no intention of abandoning acting. Management gave him access to leading roles, feeding an appetite which he was happy to gratify away from home. In 1767, a year after the sudden death of his first wife, he rejoined Garrick at Drury Lane, and remained in the company until Garrick retired in 1776. He had graduated to stronger roles&#151;Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Orsino in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>, Jaques in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>&#151;but it was as the foil to Garrick's sprightly heroes in contemporary comedies that he proved most valuable. He was a stalwart member of London's finest theatre. He was also a man of uncommon entrepreneurial energy. While retaining his interest in the Plymouth circuit, he managed, jointly with the dancer Simon Slingsby, the Richmond assembly rooms and theatre in the summers of 1774&#150;7, and from 1778 to 1779 he was one of three lessees of the Bristol Theatre Royal, though this seems to have been a less than glorious bid to raise the status of his Plymouth stock company.<br>
<br>Jefferson was already suffering recurrent attacks of gout, and it may have been for reasons of health that he settled in Plymouth from 1780. He continued to manage theatrical affairs from his house next door to the playhouse in Frankfort Place, acting when health and circumstance allowed (he starred himself as King Lear at Exeter on 17 December 1784). By the time he surrendered his theatrical interests in 1796 there were complaints that he had outstayed his welcome, but Plymouth signalled its respect by awarding him an annual theatrical benefit, which continued until at least 1805. In his last years he was left disabled, and largely confined to his Plymouth home. It was probably there that he died in January 1807, in sufficient poverty to earn for his widow the award of &pound;10 from the Drury Lane Actors' Fund.<br>
<br>Jefferson had married his second wife, Rebecca Bainbridge, in Exeter Cathedral on 27 December 1766, less than six months after the death of his first wife. Of their five children, the three who survived infancy became actors, but it was through Joseph (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1832), the second son of Jefferson's first marriage, that the Jefferson theatrical dynasty was most famously established. Joseph emigrated to America with his Scottish wife, and their seven children all became actors. The third son, also Joseph, married an actress, and their son, Joseph Jefferson III, became an international star through his playing of Rip Van Winkle in Dion Boucicault's dramatization of Washington Irving's story. Through her marriage to B. L. Farjeon, the eldest daughter of this Joseph Jefferson restored the dynasty to England. Three of the Farjeon children, Eleanor (1881&#150;1965), Joseph Jefferson (1883&#150;1955), and Herbert (1887&#150;1945), included plays among their voluminous writings.<br>
