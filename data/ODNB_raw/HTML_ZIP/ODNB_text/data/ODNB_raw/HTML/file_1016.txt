<span class="headword">Baddeley,  Robert</span>  (1733&#150;1794), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 20 April 1733, perhaps in London. The identities of his parents are unknown; it is usually said that he was orphaned at an early age. He was brought up to be a cook. Among his early employers was the actor and manager Samuel Foote, who may have inspired him to follow a stage career. As a young man he spent three years as a valet on the grand tour, where he gained an insight into foreign customs as well as exposure to different languages and accents. It was his facility with these that later provided the basis for his most popular stage performances.<br>
<br>On his return to London, Baddeley rejoined Foote, this time as an actor at the Haymarket, where he made his d&eacute;but on 28 June 1760, as Sir William Wealthy in Foote's <span class="italic">The Minor</span>. He travelled with the play to Drury Lane, appearing there for the first time on 20 October 1760, and played several other roles at Drury Lane that season, including Gomez in Dryden's <span class="italic">The Spanish Fryar</span>&#151;a part which was also included in his repertory in winter 1761 at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. He became a full member of the Drury Lane company at the beginning of the 1762&#150;3 season and remained there for the rest of his career, with the exception of a single appearance at Covent Garden as Polonius on 21 April 1772. He was most renowned for his comic foreigners, an early success (in addition to Gomez) being Canton, the Swiss valet in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span>, by George Colman the elder and David Garrick.<br>
<br>In 1763 Baddeley eloped with Sophia Snow [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1017/', "Baddeley, Sophia (1744?&#150;1786)")</script>]. He supported his wife's acting career, introducing her into the Drury Lane company in 1764, but although the couple were successful on the stage they rapidly became estranged. By 1770 Baddeley was insisting his wife stop living with a Dr Hayes; Sophia consented on the condition that she receive her own salary from Garrick rather than have it paid to her husband. Baddeley agreed on condition that Sophia pay some of his debts. Hope of a settlement was frustrated when Garrick's brother and assistant manager George declared that he did not believe reports of Sophia's misconduct and challenged Baddeley to a duel. Baddeley was probably no stranger to duelling&#151;Kelly recalled that he once challenged Foote to a duel while acting at the Haymarket&#151;and assented. The parties met in Hyde Park on the morning of 17 March 1770. Baddeley fired first and missed; he was saved after Sophia stood between the combatants and implored George Garrick to spare her husband's life. A separation was subsequently agreed. Baddeley later lived with Catherine Sherry, and at the time of his death with Catherine Strickland.<br>
<br>Baddeley's separation did not harm his acting career. As well as continuing at Drury Lane he appeared at the Haymarket in some summer seasons and also experimented with other entertainments, such as &#145;The Modern Magic Lanthorn&#146;, which he presented at various locations in 1774 and 1775. On 8 May 1777 he made his first appearance as Moses in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, creating the role with which he would most be associated and which he perpetuated in at least two interludes written by himself.<br>
<br>Although he suffered an apoplectic fit on 30 May 1780, which prevented him from playing Catchpenny in <span class="italic">The Suicide</span> (by Colman the elder), Baddeley returned to the stage on 6 June and seems to have remained in good health until 19 November 1794, when he was taken ill while dressing for Moses in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> at Drury Lane. He died the next morning, 20 November, at his home, 10 New Store Street, Bedford Square, and was buried beside Catherine Sherry, as he requested, in St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 27 November.<br>
<br>Baddeley was the last member of the Drury Lane company to wear the scarlet cloth and lace livery of a gentleman of the great chamber; ten actors of the company were meant to wear this livery as a badge of the company's royal protection. His commitment to Drury Lane and the theatrical profession had been demonstrated in 1774 by his place among the founders of the Society for the Relief of Indigent Persons Belonging to Drury Lane Theatre, usually called the &#145;theatrical fund&#146;. His will, dated 23 April 1792 and proved on 18 December 1794, left his effects, his theatrical possessions, his &#145;Garrick's head&#146; (probably his medallion as a member of the School of Garrick, a club established to honour Garrick's memory), and his houses at New Store Street and West Molesey, Surrey, to Catherine Strickland, &#145;Mrs Baddeley&#146;. After her death the houses and &pound;650 held in trust were to pass to the Drury Lane theatrical fund. The house at Molesey was to become Baddeley's Asylum, a home for theatrical folk who &#145;from accident or misfortune may have been prevented continuing their subscription long enough to entitle them to an annuity&#146;. However, whether through legal problems regarding the bequest or insufficient money to support the property, the house was sold.<br>
<br>Baddeley also created a small trust whereby every 5 January the Drury Lane company, still in their costumes, receive a glass of punch and slice of cake, known as the &#145;Baddeley Cake&#146;. This tradition was still being maintained at the close of the twentieth century.<br>
