<span class="headword">Yeldard,  Arthur</span>  (<em>c.</em>1526<span class="mult">x</span>30&#150;1599), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in Houghton-Strother-on-Tyne, Northumberland. Nothing is known of his family background or early years, and there is no evidence for Thomas Warton's assertion that he was a chorister of Durham Cathedral and a master of Rotherham College, Yorkshire. Yeldard matriculated as a sizar of Clare College, Cambridge, in 1544. He graduated BA in 1548 and by 1550 had been elected fellow of Pembroke College, where he held office as junior treasurer the following year. Throughout his life Yeldard demonstrated a happy ability to secure the goodwill of influential patrons. He came to the attention of Princess Mary through her chaplain, Francis Mallett, dean of Lincoln, and received from her an annual exhibition. He also secured the position of tutor to Henry and Anthony, the sons of the late Sir Anthony Denny, following their matriculation in November 1552. Yeldard travelled abroad with his charges, and in December 1553 they were at Dilling in Flanders, from where he dedicated a translation of <span class="italic">Documenta quaedam admonitoria Agapeti Diaconi</span> in fulsome and grateful terms to Queen Mary.<br>
<br>Yeldard's most significant patron was Sir Thomas Pope, privy councillor and founder of Trinity College, Oxford. Yeldard's personable and intellectual qualities secured Pope's lasting confidence, and in 1555 Yeldard was admitted the first of the foundation fellows and philosophy lecturer of the new college. Commissions undertaken for Pope included important work on the composition of the college statutes. In July 1557 Yeldard's teaching skills were tested when Pope entrusted him with the tuition of his wayward stepson, John Basford. Yeldard persevered with his reluctant and Latin-resistant pupil and was rewarded by the friendship of the young man's mother, Elizabeth Pope, who in 1559 nominated him to succeed Thomas Slythurst as president of Trinity College. This was by no means an easy position. Pope's sudden death six months previously had left Trinity's finances precarious, while the whole college was scrutinized closely by the parliamentary commissioners of the succeeding decade. Trinity's buildings, erected for the medieval Durham College, needed constant repair. However, Yeldard proved a capable administrator. Undergraduate numbers increased and in the forty years of his presidency he did much to consolidate revenues and fabric alike. As president Yeldard could marry, and he did so, but nothing is known of his wife, except her name, Eleanor.<br>
<br>Warton included Yeldard among &#145;the capital scholars of those times&#146;, and credited his Latin prose &#145;with great elegance and perspicuity&#146;  (Warton, 390). Few lines survive of his fine Latin verse: eleven elegiac couplets at the end of L. Humphrey's <span class="italic">Vita Juelli</span> (1573), eight couplets prefixed to John Case's <span class="italic">Speculum moralium quaestionum</span> (1585), and twenty hexameters in Robert Wright's edition of <span class="italic">Funebria Henrici Unton</span> (1596). Yeldard proceeded to the degrees of BD in 1563 and DD in 1566. In a wider sphere he served on a number of university committees, notably for the reception of Queen Elizabeth in 1566, when he disputed before her, and on the reform of the statutes in 1576. He was elected vice-chancellor for one year in 1580. Wood relates a libellous pun on Yeldard's name, that having once left England for religious principles he later submitted to the protestant faith &#145;with yelding voice&#146;  (Blakiston, 82). But there is no evidence that Yeldard ever acted against his conscience; indeed, Wood also states that Ralph Kettell &#145;did always report him to have lived a severe and religious life&#146;  (ibid.). In his will Yeldard left six volumes of the <span class="italic">Centuriae Magdeburgenses</span> to Trinity College, and everything else to his wife. He died on 1 February 1599, and was buried in the chapel of the college he had served so faithfully.<br>
