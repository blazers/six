<span class="headword">Sterling,  John</span>  (1806&#150;1844), <span class="occ">writer and poet</span>, was born on 20 July 1806 at Kames Castle on the Isle of Bute, the son of <a name="cosubject_26406"></a><span class="headword">Edward Sterling</span>  (1773&#150;1847), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, and his wife, Hester Coningham (1783&#150;1843). Edward Sterling's father, the Revd Anthony Sterling (<i>b</i>. 1739), was subdean of Waterford Cathedral. Edward was born at the deanery, Waterford, on 27 February 1773, and following family tradition matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1788. Admitted to the Middle Temple in 1791, he was called to the Irish bar in 1794 but joined the Loyal Irish Volunteers and fought at Vinegar Hill in 1798. After the rising he accepted a commission as captain in the 2nd regiment, Royal Lancashire militia, and in 1799 in the 16th Buckinghamshire regiment of foot. In summer 1803 he moved to the 8th battalion reserve and was quartered in Londonderry. There he met Hester Coningham whom Carlyle called &#145;the queen of the scene, and of the fair world in Derry&#146;  (Carlyle, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 17). Hester, the only daughter of the merchant John Coningham, married Edward on 5 April 1804 in Fehan church, and their first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26405/', "Anthony Coningham Sterling (1805&#150;1871)")</script> was born in the following January at Dundalk. Edward inherited a small pension from his father and drew half pay on reserve, but the family moved to Scotland where the Coninghams had a distant connection with the earls of Bute. Of the couple's seven children only Anthony and John survived into adulthood, and John remembered being a sickly boy.<br>
<br>In autumn 1809 Edward Sterling moved his family to a cottage in Llanblethian near Cowbridge in Wales, in order, Carlyle speculates in his memorial <span class="italic">Life of John Sterling</span> (1851), to be nearer his occupations in Dublin and London and to obtain better schooling for his sons. From this refuge Edward began publishing spirited letters and pamphlets on military and political issues that earned him notice in London. Late in 1812 Edward accepted appointment as a staff writer for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and for the next twenty-eight years did much to establish its tone on leading issues. Edward moved to France in May 1814 and was joined by his family. In the following March he remained in Paris for just long enough to witness Napoleon's return, while his family fled by carriage to Dieppe. Over the next four years the family moved about London&#151;to Russell Square, Queen Square, Blackfriars Road, and The Grove in Blackheath. During these years Edward cultivated his powerful connections and rose to become co-proprietor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Carlyle portrays Edward as the &#145;thunderer&#146; of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which was his &#145;express emblem&#146;  (Carlyle, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 304). Edward retired from active journalism soon after 1840, and died on 3 September 1847 at South Place, Knightsbridge.<h2>
<a name="Educationandchoiceofcareer"></a>Education and choice of career</h2>John Sterling's poor health prevented him from attending public school, but he studied at Greenwich School, Blackheath School, and finally Christ's Hospital. He was sent to Glasgow University from 1822 to 1824, where he befriended fellow student William Jacobson, later regius professor of divinity at Oxford. Sterling was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, in February 1824. In that same month he was elected to membership in the newly reactivated Union Society, increasingly a centre of lively intellectual debate. Sterling rose through the offices of the Union Society, becoming president in Easter 1827. Carlyle and J. C. Hare diverge in their accounts of his Cambridge years, though as his tutor Hare certainly knew Sterling better at this time and did much to guide the development of his ideas. In November 1825 Sterling was elected to the recently formed Cambridge Conversazione Society, better known as the Cambridge Apostles. Between the union and the Apostles, Sterling forged bonds of friendship with many of the most influential leaders of the rising generation.<br>
<br>Torn between careers in law, politics, the church, and literature, Sterling migrated to Trinity Hall in March 1826. F. D. Maurice and Sterling founded the <span class="italic">Metropolitan Quarterly Magazine</span> on the model of the great journals of the day. Though short-lived, it became the collective product of the Apostles, and especially of the Coleridgean faction among them, styled &#145;the mystics&#146;. In August 1827 Sterling first visited Coleridge at Highgate, there beginning his life's most important intellectual association. Later that year Sterling left Cambridge and settled in London, briefly acting as secretary for a free-trade association. In support of a popular uprising in Spain he published a fiery paper, under the pseudonym Jacob Sternwall, called <span class="italic">Thoughts on the Foreign Policy of England</span> (1827). He was admitted to the Inner Temple in April 1828 but does not appear to have kept terms. John Stuart Mill recalls the appearance at this time of Sterling and Maurice in the London Debating Society, where they represented<blockquote>a second Liberal and even Radical party, on totally different grounds from Benthamism and vehemently opposed to it; bringing into these discussions the general doctrines and modes of thought of the European reaction against the philosophy of the eighteenth century. (Mill, <span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 128)</blockquote>This reaction was nowhere more evident than in the early numbers of the weekly <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, founded by James Silk Buckingham in January 1828, but over the next several years owned, edited, and written largely by Sterling, Maurice, and other Apostles.<br>
<br>John Sterling thus became a writer as well as an orator. He translated French and Spanish poetry, and wrote original prose tales and essays, some of which were later collected by Hare. After a swift trip to France and Italy in 1828 he began his novel of spiritual crisis, <span class="italic">Arthur Coningsby</span>, set during the French Revolution and published anonymously four years later by Effingham Wilson. Admired by Mill, Coleridge, and Carlyle, the novel was warmly received by contemporary reviewers. Sterling's literary and political concerns intersected in the plight of the Spanish exiles then so prominent in London. Sterling forced the issue among the Apostles and was instrumental in equipping the ill-fated coup led by General Torrijos. Sterling invested all the energy in this campaign that the former generation of English poets had invested in the French Revolution. He visited Wordsworth in the Lake District at this time and continued frequent meetings with Coleridge, portions of whose <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> and <span class="italic">Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit</span> he preserved.<br>
<br>In spring 1830 after the inauspicious launch of the Spanish expedition, described by Carlyle, Sterling could do nothing but wait. His friendships grew with Mill and his circle, especially Sarah Austin, who taught him German. Maurice had gone up to Oxford to prepare for the church, but other Cambridge friends remained, among them Richard Chenevix Trench, J. W. Blakesley, Charles Buller, Arthur Henry Hallam, Alfred Tennyson, John Mitchell Kemble, and Charles Barton. For a period he courted Fanny Kemble, but by autumn 1830 he had discovered Susannah Barton (1801&#150;1843), eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Barton (1760&#150;1819) of the 2nd Life Guards and his wife, Susannah Johnston, of the family of Bordeaux wine merchants. Carlyle portrays her as &#145;a stately blooming black-eyed young woman&#146;  (Carlyle, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 83), qualities borne out by a surviving sketch. Sterling and Susannah were married on 2 November 1830 in Christ Church, Marylebone. Sterling planned to return to Cambridge to take his degree and then study in Germany, but he fell seriously ill early in the winter. When he recovered he accepted a proposal to emigrate to the West Indies; there his mother's uncle Walter Coningham had established a prosperous sugar plantation at Colonarie Vale in St Vincent, part of which Sterling inherited. The couple sailed in May 1831, weathered the hurricane of 11 August, and on 14 October, during the rebuilding, had a son, Edward Coningham Sterling, who was born at the neighbouring Munro plantation.<br>
<br>The fifteen months Sterling spent in St Vincent were turbulent in England. Some of his correspondence analysing the conditions of slaves and slave owners appeared in parliamentary reports and the pages of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He worked to establish better schooling for his slaves, and when he returned to England with his family late in summer 1832 he planned to engage a good schoolmaster and return to the islands. His wife had a difficult crossing, though, and seven months later in March 1833 gave birth to a daughter, Anna Charlotte, at Knightsbridge. Encouraged by Coleridge to immerse himself in German literature and philosophy, in May 1833 Sterling took his family to Bonn, where he stayed with in-laws and joined the circle of A. W. Schlegel. In June he met J. C. Hare who was completing a continental tour prior to assuming the family living at Herstmonceux in Sussex. Hare mentioned the availability of his curacy, and Sterling set his course toward this end. That autumn he began keeping the necessary terms at Cambridge, and in the following year he took his BA and was ordained deacon at Lincoln's Inn Chapel on 22 June 1834. Sterling always considered the clergy to be what Coleridge called more broadly a &#145;clerisy&#146;&#151;a distinction Carlyle, for one, seems not to have accepted. When Coleridge died that summer, Sterling made the journey to Highgate to join the small party at the funeral, and afterwards he and Hare were entrusted with Coleridge's unpublished theological manuscripts. The Sterlings' third child, Katherine Susan, was born at Herstmonceux that May. For sixteen months Sterling lived and worked in a parish of 1400 people, months which Hare remembered affectionately in his memoir and which Sterling regarded as &#145;the one sabbath of my life&#146;  (Hare, lix). When in London to consult the doctors in February 1835 Sterling first met Carlyle at Mill's office. There followed a lively correspondence, much of which in highly edited form Carlyle prints in his biography of Sterling.<h2>
<a name="Theclerisyandalifeofletters"></a>The clerisy and a life of letters</h2>From his next home in Bayswater, Sterling combined imaginative literature with essays born of his study of the Germans, especially Schleiermacher and Tholuck. He hoped for an appointment either to the English chaplaincy in Rome or by his friend Henry Taylor in the Colonial Office to inspect schools in the West Indies. Another daughter, Julia Maria, was born in March 1836, and Sterling's pulmonary complaints returned, forcing the whole family in the late summer to Bordeaux, where Susannah's maternal uncle kept an estate. Both Carlyle and Hare disparage Sterling's poetic achievements over the next years, but they were praised by many, including John Wilson in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. Sterling read and wrote furiously, completing his long Wordsworthian tale <span class="italic">The Sexton's Daughter</span>, which still retains emotional power. In summer 1837 he journeyed to Clifton to visit his wife's mother and sister Anna Barton who was thus engaged to marry Maurice. On his return to France he faced an outbreak of cholera and moved swiftly with his family to London, determining to leave them at South Place, Knightsbridge, and spend the winter by himself in Madeira. He sailed in October 1837 accompanied by a host of literary and theological ambitions. In the ensuing months he placed varied works in <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span>, philosophic dialogues and aphorisms, prose fantasies, translations, reviews, poetry, and a novella called <span class="italic">The Onyx Ring</span> which Carlyle approved and in which he, Hare, and Goethe supply characters. In Madeira he befriended Dr John Mitchinson Calvert, nephew of Wordsworth's benefactor Raisley Calvert. Rejoining his family in April 1838 he settled briefly in Blackheath and then in Hastings, but travelled often to London both to promote his growing literary reputation and to rekindle his large circle of friendships. At this time began the monthly dinners of what came to be known as the Sterling Club, later a source of much indignation in the religious press for its supposedly impious activities. Mill had recently become proprietor of the <span class="italic">London and Westminster Review</span> where he welcomed Sterling's articles on Montaigne and Simonides and a poem on Abelard later in 1838.<br>
<br>In autumn 1838, accompanied by Calvert, Sterling travelled to Rome under medical orders of Sir James Clark. He met and toured with Mill, also recuperating. His fifth child, Charles Frederick Everland, was born prematurely at Hastings in March 1839 but died within the month, before Sterling could manage his hasty return. In June 1839 he moved his family to Clifton, where his friends soon came to include the Stracheys, Dr John Addington Symonds, and Francis W. Newman, then of Bristol College. In October 1839 Mill published Sterling's splendid controversial essay on Carlyle. In that same month <span class="italic">Blackwood's</span> began to serialize his translation of Goethe's <span class="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit</span> and his contributions started appearing in Maurice's <span class="italic">Educational Magazine</span>. As he was collecting his poetry for the volume Moxon published at the end of the year, he also began research for his verse drama <span class="italic">Strafford</span>, and he initiated correspondence with Ralph Waldo Emerson in America.<h2>
<a name="Timeswingedchariotfinalyears"></a>Time's winged chariot: final years</h2>Symptoms of consumption returned, and early in 1840 Sterling retreated to Falmouth while awaiting the ship to Madeira. The milder climate and stimulating society induced him to postpone his departure, though. The journals of Barclay and Caroline Fox abound in accounts of Sterling's impact on their community. Reaction to his volume of poems was not as general as he had hoped, though Emerson applauded and Henry Nelson Coleridge reviewed them approvingly in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. Sterling returned to Clifton in early April having written a dozen or so essays in the winter, but finding theological controversy increasingly unrewarding. Despite poor health in September he reported having finished a draft of the book that became his delightful verse narrative <span class="italic">The Election</span>, published anonymously by Murray the following summer (1841) to high praise from Mill and Carlyle. On 12 October 1840 John Barton Sterling was born in Clifton, and in November Sterling resolved to begin the winter in Torquay. After more than a month of freezing weather Sterling returned to his family at Clifton, having worked out the draft of his political verse tragedy, <span class="italic">Strafford</span>. His father, Edward, had at this time begun to retire from journalism, and John Sterling became more involved, publishing controversial pieces in <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. Towards the end of April 1841 he bought a house in Falmouth and moved his family from Clifton late in May. Here he lectured to acclaim at the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, founded a decade earlier by the Fox family. Word came that Emerson wished to produce a revised edition of Sterling's poems in America, and Sterling set about updating his collection. He also began composing a long poem in <i>ottava rima</i>, <span class="italic">Coeur-de-Lion</span>.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1842 Calvert died in Falmouth, and Sterling felt the loss acutely. Sterling had also lost financially in the collapse of an American canal company and sought revenue from his writing. Carlyle solicited reviews on behalf of John Forster for the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span>. Increasingly poor health drove Sterling to leave for Malta and Italy in April. He returned with a week's journey across France in early June. He spent the latter half of June in London, visiting the Carlyles, Foxes, Mill, and other friends&#151;among them John Lockhart, editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, for whom he produced a favourable review of Tennyson's <span class="italic">Poems</span>, published in September, distressing J. W. Croker who opposed Tennyson from the beginning.<br>
<br>Early in 1843 Sterling suffered a haemorrhage while helping a maid to move a table, and was bedridden for some months. His mother also fell ill in London, and his wife neared her term with their seventh child. He made a brief visit to his mother's bedside and returned to his wife's late in March. On Good Friday, 14 April 1843, Hester Isabella Sterling was born at Falmouth, but on Easter Sunday Sterling's mother died in London, and within minutes of the news having reached her, Susannah lost consciousness, dying on 18 April. Sterling was devastated. A month later he met Anna Barton Maurice in London, where she helped arrange the children's education. To get nearer to London, Sterling moved to the Isle of Wight, where he began rebuilding a house at Hillside near Ventnor. In July he returned to Falmouth for a week and then to London, where Moxon published <span class="italic">Strafford</span> with its dedication to Emerson. More than once Sterling's proposed meetings with Tennyson were abandoned, though he did entertain Theodore Parker and Henry James senior from America. The latter reflected on his new acquaintances:<blockquote>Mr Mill was the best of the whole lot, except Sterling, who was the truest man I ever met &hellip; Sterling was a perfectly delightful man, just the antipodes of Carlyle and the only man Carlyle had any sincere attachment to. Sterling was the only man in England who seemed like an American in spirit and manners. He was then near the end of his life. He talked freely, was jocund, very full of life, and was dying in perfect confidence. (<span class="italic">Boston Sunday Herald</span>, 17 April 1881)</blockquote>By the end of December Sterling had finished much of <span class="italic">Coeur-de-Lion</span>, to which Carlyle responded, &#145;if a man <i>would</i> write in metre, this sure enough, was the way to try doing it&#146;  (Carlyle, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 321). In January 1844 Sterling proposed marriage to Caroline Fox, and the bright, lively young woman declined, led by her parents' concerns about a man of such uncertain health who was not a Quaker. This, too, deadened Sterling's spirits in his long last winter at Hillside. Early in April he haemorrhaged badly. Though bedridden, he completed an extraordinary sequence of letters to his son Edward, at school in London. In August he began his valedictory letters. He died at Hillside, on 18 September 1844 and was buried in the churchyard at Bonchurch. A number of his works were published posthumously, and he was memorialized scores of times in decades to come.<br>
