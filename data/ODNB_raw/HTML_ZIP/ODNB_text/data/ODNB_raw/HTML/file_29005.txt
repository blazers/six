<span class="headword">Wellesley,  Henry</span>  (1794&#150;1866), <span class="occ">college head and art connoisseur</span>, was born on 20 January 1794 at Park Lane in the parish of St George Hanover Square, London, the third son and youngest of five illegitimate children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29008/', "Richard Wellesley, second earl of Mornington and later first Marquess Wellesley (1760&#150;1842)")</script>, statesman, and Hyacinthe Gabrielle Roland (1760?&#150;1816) daughter of Pierre Roland, of Paris. His parents married in November 1794 but were formally separated in 1810 after his father's long absence in India as governor-general (1797&#150;1806). Wellesley was educated at the Revd Richard Roberts's Preparatory School in Mitcham, Surrey (1800&#150;06), and Eton College (1806&#150;11) before going up in October 1811 to Christ Church, Oxford, where he held a studentship until 1828. He graduated BA in 1816, with second class honours in classics, and MA in 1818. He was briefly enrolled at Lincoln's Inn in 1816 but was ordained at Oxford in 1823, and after travelling extensively in Europe he was appointed vicar of Flitton-with-Silsoe, Bedfordshire, in 1827. He was subsequently rector of Dunsfold in Surrey (1833&#150;8), Woodmancote in Sussex (1838&#150;60), and Herstmonceux in Sussex (1860&#150;66). In 1835 he married Charlotte Anne Mackenzie Vandyck (1817?/1818&#150;1845), the stepdaughter of the Revd William Mackenzie DD, rector of Hascombe in Surrey. They had three sons, one of whom died at birth, and a daughter.<br>
<br>Although he remained a partially resident incumbent until his death, Wellesley was not entirely suited to the life of a country clergyman and was keen to return to Oxford. He unsuccessfully sought a canonry at Christ Church in 1830 and the regius professorship of modern history and modern languages in 1842, but in the latter year he was appointed vice-principal of New Inn Hall and in 1847 succeeded to the principalship on the nomination of his uncle the duke of Wellington, then chancellor of the university. In the same year he took the degrees of BD and DD and was appointed as a select preacher in the university. A connoisseur of old master prints and drawings with contacts in the art trade, he was one of the original curators of the university galleries and the leading figure in the campaign which acquired by public subscription the Raphael and Michelangelo drawings, delivered to Oxford in 1845, from the collection of Sir Thomas Lawrence. His own remarkable collection was largely broken up at sales in London and Paris, both before and after his death. Noted for his linguistic ability and especially his mastery of Italian dialects, he promoted the study of modern European languages in the university by the donation of books to the Taylor Institution, of which he was a curator from 1855; he was examiner in Italian for the scholarships offered there from 1858. His most substantial publication, <span class="italic">Anthologia polyglotta: a selection of versions in various languages chiefly from the Greek anthology</span> (1849), was intended to stimulate interest in the same field, then in the very early stages of development at Oxford. Elected a curator of the Bodleian Library in 1856, he represented it in negotiations to improve the copyright deposit procedure and devised a scheme for the enlargement of the library's storage capacity which, although not implemented, influenced designs for its expansion until the end of the century. He was also a delegate of the University Museum and one of the four members of the sub-delegacy which in 1854 steered the university towards choosing a Gothic design for that building.<br>
<br>Wellesley's other publications included an edition of the catalogue of the Bodleian's Canonici Italian manuscripts by his friend Count Alessandro Mortara and antiquarian papers in the <span class="italic">Collections</span> of the Sussex Archaeological Society, of which he was a founder member. Portraits suggest that Wellesley, who was considered to resemble his uncle, the duke of Wellington, was tall and of medium build; he was admired for his sociability, courteous and agreeable manner, and the light way he carried his learning. He died of prostatic disease at New Inn Hall, Oxford, on 11 January 1866 and was buried five days later at Iffley.<br>
