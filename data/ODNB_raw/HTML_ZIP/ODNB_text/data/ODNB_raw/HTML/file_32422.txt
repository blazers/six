<span class="headword">Kerr,  Archibald John Kerr  Clark</span>, Baron Inverchapel  (1882&#150;1951), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 17 March 1882 at Watson's Bay, near Sydney, Australia, the fifth son of John Kerr Clark (1838&#150;1910), sheep station owner, originally from Crossbasket, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, and his wife, Kate Louisa (1846&#150;1926), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23804/', "Sir John Robertson")</script>, prime minister of New South Wales. Both sides of his family had Scottish roots and Clark Kerr would later acquire land at Inverchapel on Loch Eck, Argyll, where the family had been since the fifteenth century. In March 1911 he took the additional surname of Kerr. In 1889 his parents moved to England, though his father later returned to Australia. He was educated at Bath College, and in France, Germany, and Italy where he studied languages. In March 1906 he passed the examination for the diplomatic service and was posted to Berlin, where he remained from October 1906 to April 1910. He was promoted third secretary in March 1908. He was transferred in April 1910 to Buenos Aires, and in March 1911 to Washington, where he served as British secretary of the British and American claims arbitration tribunal. He was posted to Rome in June 1913, being promoted second secretary in February 1914, and then to Tehran in December 1914, where he served as secretary in charge of commercial matters. He returned to the Foreign Office in November 1916. After an older brother was killed in the First World War he volunteered for service and, despite opposition from the Foreign Office, was finally allowed to enlist as a private in the Scots Guards, though he served only from June to November 1918 before being returned to the Foreign Office at the end of hostilities. In September 1919 he was promoted first secretary and posted to Tangier.<br>
<br>In February 1922 Clark Kerr was posted to Cairo, serving as deputy to Lord Allenby, the high commissioner. He was promoted acting counsellor in November 1923. He favoured support for Egyptian aspirations to end the British protectorate, which he considered inevitable, as the best way of protecting British interests in the future. In November 1924, when Egyptian nationalists shot the sirdar, Sir Lee Stack, it was Clark Kerr who found him, slumped in his car, which had managed to reach the residency. The resultant crisis between Britain and Egypt almost proved fatal for Clark Kerr's career. Allenby acted robustly, but not with the full concurrence of London, which decided to send out a senior diplomat to join Allenby to brief him more fully on London's views. This new official, Nevile Henderson, would be senior to Clark Kerr, and Allenby, taking umbrage at what he interpreted as an attempt to undermine his authority, proffered his resignation. The Foreign Office felt that Clark Kerr bore some responsibility for the high commissioner's hasty actions and, since he had previously fallen foul of the new permanent under-secretary, Sir William Tyrrell, it was not long before an attempt was made to transfer him to Tokyo.<br>
<br>Clark Kerr, frustrated by the Foreign Office's attitude, considered leaving the service, but supporters in London, most surprisingly Winston Churchill, came to his aid. Churchill's assistance was ironical, since Clark Kerr had previously detested his politics. Churchill, however, approved of Clerk Kerr for maintaining an effective British policy in Egypt, and this goodwill would later be critical in his career. Thus in late 1925 Clark Kerr found himself not only travelling to the Central American republics rather than Tokyo, but with the rank of minister, for which he was still relatively young. The final leg of his journey to Guatemala, where he took up his post in December, was made on a Fyffes banana boat. His time in the region was otherwise uneventful. In February 1928 he was transferred to Chile and in April 1931 he was moved again, this time to be minister at Stockholm. In this as in previous legations he showed diplomatic competence, though there was still a feeling that a shadow hung over him from his time in Egypt which was preventing his appointment to major posts. In January 1935, however, he was appointed KCMG, and in March 1935 he was appointed ambassador to Iraq, one of the least prestigious of the embassy grade posts, but still placing him in the highest rank of the service. The situation in Baghdad was very fluid and Clark Kerr proved adept at dealing with the local complexities. This helped lead to his appointment, after only three years, as ambassador to war-torn China.<br>
<br>It was with his appointment to China, in February 1938, that Clark Kerr embarked upon the greatest phase of his career, serving after Peking (Beijing) as ambassador in Moscow and then in Washington. An opponent of appeasement, he made every effort to pursue policies which would deter Japanese aggression. These views brought him into conflict with those seeking to conciliate Japan, in particular the British ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie. Clark Kerr's views on the rivalry between the Chinese nationalists and the communists were more ambivalent. It appears that in private conversation he predicted the inevitable victory of the forces of Mao Zedong, but his dispatches to London do not convey this view. The truth probably lies in his official dispatches, while his comments in conversation may well have been a product of his diplomatic skill at assessing others' views.<br>
<br>Clark Kerr's success in China was rewarded in January 1942 with promotion to GCMG and in February 1942 with a move to Moscow. His tasks included maintaining serviceable Anglo-Soviet relations, which were being placed under stress by Stalin's demands for a second front. He played a key role in the 1943 Moscow meeting of the foreign ministers of the &#145;big three&#146; allied powers, which was recognized by his appointment as a privy councillor in January 1944. His three and a half years at Moscow were notable for the skill with which he succeeded in smoothing over the rough places in the wartime relationship between Britain and the USSR. His success was recognized with elevation to the peerage, in April 1946, as Baron Inverchapel of Loch Eck, and appointment, in May 1946, to the post with which he had long wished to cap his career, the Washington embassy. Nevertheless, in many ways Washington was an anticlimax. He thrived best in daunting situations, but in the post-war climate of Washington he faced mostly economic issues, a sphere of diplomatic activity that bored him. He did, however, play a major role in persuading the United States government of the stresses under which Britain was operating, which in turn led to the Truman doctrine and the Marshall plan.<br>
<br>Inverchapel retired from the foreign service in March 1948, but was almost immediately appointed to the new committee on European unity (1948&#150;9). He always affected support for the Labour Party and socialist aspirations. While capable of being a stickler for diplomatic formalities, he insisted that everyone call him Archie. He was eccentric, refusing to write with anything other than goose quill pens. One of the most colourful representatives of an age of notable diplomatists, he was a genuine individual.<br>
<br>Clark Kerr's personal life was complex. He had always enjoyed a close relationship with his mother, who accompanied him to Central America, and he was devastated when she died a few months later. Three years afterwards, while serving in Chile, he married, on 24 April 1929, a Chilean twenty-nine years his junior, Maria Teresa (Tita) Diaz Salas (<i>d</i>. 1987), daughter of Don Javier Diaz Lira, of Santiago. It proved a volatile marriage, with Tita leaving him during the difficult years of his embassy to China. Divorced in 1945, they remarried in 1947, when he held the more salubrious Washington embassy. They had no children. There can be no doubt that Clark Kerr was devoted to his young wife, and that her desertion caused him immense pain, and her subsequent return great joy. He also enjoyed close and emotionally fulfilling relationships with some of his colleagues, among them Harold Nicolson, whom he affectionately dubbed Clarice, and Gerald Villiers. He died at Greenock on 5 July 1951 and was buried at Inverchapel on the 9th.<br>
