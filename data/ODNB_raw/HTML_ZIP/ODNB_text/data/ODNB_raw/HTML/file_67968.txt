<span class="headword">Mico <span class="st"> [Meco]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1661), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, was the eldest of four sons and five daughters of Walter Mico of Taunton in Somerset, who was probably involved in the cloth trade, and his wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. 1616), from an Oxfordshire family named Awdrey. His younger brother Walter Mico (1595&#150;1647) described their parents, in a statement made on his admission to the Jesuit English College in Rome, as protestants of the middling sort, but not unlearned. Although there are no surviving records of Mico's early life, it is likely that he was, like Walter, educated at the grammar school in Taunton.<br>
<br>Mico's first known employment began in 1608, when he was appointed resident musician at Thorndon Hall in Essex, the seat of John, first Lord Petre. His immediate employer was John Petre's son, Sir William Petre, and his principal responsibility seems to have been the musical education of the family's children. He also took charge of all the musical instruments: an inventory dated 1608, and signed by Mico, lists five viols, lutes, virginals, and an organ, as well as printed music and manuscript partbooks. No resident musician had been employed at Thorndon Hall since 1593, but at about that time William Byrd had taken up residence nearby and had begun a long and close association with the Petres; another inventory for 1608 lists &#145;Mr Birds chamber&#146;. There is no evidence that Byrd actually taught Mico, but he must have been very closely involved in the choice of a new resident musician. Mico's wages on first appointment were &pound;10 per annum, somewhat above average for this type of post, implying that, although probably still under twenty, he was already seen as an exceptionally able musician. The Petre family, like William Byrd, were Catholics: Mico was to convert to Catholicism by 1614. In 1628 he married Ann Lambe, a maid.<br>
<br>It is likely that all of Mico's surviving compositions date from his period at Thorndon Hall. A total of forty-one pieces survive, all for consorts of between two and five viols, with or without organ. The majority are fantasias (or &#145;fancies&#146;) and pavans, and are stylistically very conservative for this period. His fantasias, for example, are almost consistently contrapuntal, with scarcely any element of chordal texture. Moreover they contain no triple-time writing, which the more madrigalian composers often used to provide passages of homophonic relief. Apart from fantasias and pavans, Mico also wrote one <span class="roman">In nomine</span> and a piece entitled &#145;Latral&#146;. This latter work, a musical response to part of a madrigal by Monteverdi (&#145;Vattene pur, crudel&#146;), demonstrates great technical and imaginative resource, and seems to have no direct parallel among English consort music of this period.<br>
<br>Mico was evidently a highly accomplished organist, for in 1630, on the death of Richard Dering, he was appointed organist to Queen Henrietta Maria. His musical activities in this post would have been very different from those at the Petre residence, with a greater emphasis on sacred music, both at the chapel of St James's Palace and at the chapel of Somerset House. In 1634 he registered a coat of arms, and in 1639 was referred to as &#145;Richard Mico of London gent&#146;. He held his post in the queen's household until her flight to the Netherlands in 1642. No record of him during the civil war period has been found, but he probably remained in London, where the next reference to him is in 1651. In 1658 he was in receipt of a life annuity of &pound;20 from the Petre family. He survived to see the Restoration but died the following year, and was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 10 April 1661.<br>
