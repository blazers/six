<span class="headword">Masson, Sir  David Orme</span>  (1858&#150;1937), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 13 January 1858, probably in Avenue Road, Hampstead, London, the second child of four and only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34924/', "David Masson (1822&#150;1907)")</script>, the historiographer royal for Scotland, who was then professor of English literature at University College, London, and his wife, Emily Rosaline (1835&#150;1915), eldest daughter of Charles Orme, of Hampstead. In London and then in Edinburgh, Masson's childhood and youth were strongly coloured by the literary influences of his father's and mother's circles, which included the Tennyson brothers, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Coventry Patmore, Giuseppe Mazzini, Thomas Carlyle, Robert Browning, and T. H. Huxley.<br>
<br>In 1865 the family moved to Edinburgh, where Masson attended first Oliphant's School and then Edinburgh Academy. In 1873 he entered Edinburgh University, later graduating in both arts and science. After a period at G&ouml;ttingen, he joined the staff of University College, Bristol, in 1880, engaging in work with William Ramsay on atomic volumes. He returned in 1881 to Edinburgh and was awarded a research fellowship in chemistry; he published several papers on glyceryl trinitrite and trinitrate, and on salts of organic bases such as sulphines. On 5 August 1886 he married Mary (1862&#150;1945), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26680/', "Sir John Struthers (1823&#150;1899)")</script>, professor of anatomy in Aberdeen University. They had three children: their son, <a href="#cosubject_38283">Sir (James) Irvine Orme Masson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a chemist, became vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield, and their two daughters were noted writers, particularly the elder, Marnie Bassett. The younger, Elsie Rosaline (<i>d</i>. 1935), was married to the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski (1884&#150;1942). After his marriage Masson emigrated to Australia, having been appointed to the chair of chemistry in the University of Melbourne. During the next fifty years he was to be one of the most prominent figures in Australian science, doing much to advance its cause in both Melbourne and the nation, both of which were growing rapidly. His wife became much involved in voluntary community work, for which she was created CBE in 1918.<br>
<br>Despite the handicaps of isolation and heavy teaching responsibilities, Masson's original scientific work was extensive and of a high quality. Apart from studies associated with the periodic classification of the elements, his chief interests lay in the development of the theory of solution as originally put forward by Svante A. Arrhenius, Jacobus Hendricus van't Hoff, Wilhelm Ostwald, and their school, and in interpreting the chemical dynamics of such reactions as that of hydrogen peroxide on potassium cyanide, the decomposition of cyanates, and the decomposition of persulphuric acid and its salts in aqueous solution. His paper on the velocity of the migration of ions was a particularly valuable contribution in its time (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 192, 1899). He was attracted by problems of theoretical interpretation rather than by those of design or manipulation of apparatus, and in his later years he contributed much to the development of ideas on the constitution of atoms, and to the theory of dissociation of electrolytes in water.<br>
<br>From 1910 Masson became absorbed more and more in university administration and in outside public work. In 1911&#150;13, as president of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science, he took the leading part in organizing the visit of the British Association to Australia in 1914. He actively assisted the first expedition under Douglas Mawson to the Antarctic in 1911&#150;14, and in 1929&#150;31 he was chairman of the committee responsible for the British, Australian, and New Zealand Antarctic research expedition. During the First World War he served on many special committees dealing with munitions and naval matters and did notable work from 1915 onwards in drafting the scheme leading to the establishment in 1920 of a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, which in 1926 was reorganized as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, on which he served until his death. Retirement from active teaching in 1923, when he was made emeritus professor, gave him increased opportunity for outside interests which included service on several business directorates.<br>
<br>The Melbourne University Chemical Society, the Society of Chemical Industry of Victoria, and the Australian Chemical Institute were all founded by Masson, as was (with Sir T. W. Edgeworth David) the Australian National Research Council. He presided over the second Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress held in Melbourne and Sydney in 1923.<br>
<br>Masson was elected FRS in 1903, and appointed CBE in 1918, and KBE in 1923; he received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University in 1924. A Masson lectureship was established in his honour by the National Research Council, and a Masson memorial scholarship by the Australian Chemical Institute.<br>
<br>His personal charm, originality, and independence of mind, and his perfect integrity made Masson a powerful influence in his adopted university and country. Together with his colleagues Sir Walter Baldwin Spencer, biologist, and Sir Thomas Lyle, physicist, he shaped the science schools of Melbourne University, particularly with respect to the teaching of advanced laboratory subjects; many of his students became successful in academia and industry. He died of cancer at his home at South Yarra, Melbourne, on 10 August 1937, and was cremated after a private funeral.<br>

<a name="cosubject_38283"></a><span class="headword">Sir (James) Irvine Orme Masson</span>  (1887&#150;1962), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in Melbourne on 3 September 1887. He was educated at Melbourne grammar school and at Ormond College (University of Melbourne). He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition scholarship, which he held at University College, London, under William Ramsay. In 1912 he was appointed to the staff of University College's chemistry department and in the following year he married Flora Lovell, daughter of G. Lovell Gulland, later professor of medicine at Edinburgh University.<br>
<br>Masson's tenure at University College was interrupted by the First World War, during which he worked at the research department of the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. In 1924 he was appointed professor of chemistry and head of the department of pure science at the University of Durham. In 1938 he went to the University of Sheffield as vice-chancellor, remaining there until his retirement in 1952. During these years he moulded the university into an expanded and modern institution.<br>
<br>Masson's interests spanned physical chemistry, the history of chemistry, and science education. He was author of <span class="italic">Three Centuries of Chemistry</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">Problems in the National Teaching of Science</span> (1931). During the Second World War, in addition to his duties as vice-chancellor, he supervised a large group involved in explosives research. Outside the sciences he had a keen interest in typography and contributed several articles to <span class="italic">Transactions of the Bibliographical Society</span>. He was elected FRS in 1939 and was awarded honorary LLDs from Edinburgh and Sheffield. He was knighted in 1950.<br>
<br>Masson retired to Edinburgh, where he spent many hours in bibliographical pursuits. His years there were saddened by the long illness of his wife, who died in 1960. Masson himself died in Edinburgh on 22 October 1962. He left one son.<br>
