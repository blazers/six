<span class="headword">Clinton,  Charles</span>  (1690&#150;1773), <span class="occ">surveyor and landowner</span>, was born in Corbay, co. Longford, the grandson of an officer of Charles I's army who had settled in Ireland. He married Elizabeth Denniston (<i>d</i>. in or after 1773), who was of Scots-Irish descent, some time before the family left for America in May 1729. The couple had seven children, three of whom were born in Ireland; two died during the voyage to America. The family's decision to leave Ireland was prompted by the religious intolerance of the dominant Anglican landowners toward their Presbyterian faith. In 1729 Clinton leased his land to Lord Granard and chartered a ship, the <i>George and Anne</i>, to carry four hundred relatives and friends to Philadelphia. Clinton landed at Cape Cod in early October after a passage that saw ninety deaths from a measles epidemic. Clinton's diary record of the crossing was published in the fourth volume of <span class="italic">Olde Ulster</span> (1905&#150;14).<br>
<br>In the spring of 1731 Clinton moved to Ulster county, New York, where he purchased land at Little Britain, about 8 miles from the Hudson River. An educated man who was learned in mathematics and literature, Clinton was employed by the New York surveyor-general, Cadwallader Colden, to assist in his survey of the province. Colden later recommended Clinton to a distant relation, Governor George Clinton, who in turn nurtured the early career of Clinton's youngest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68589/', "George Clinton (1739&#150;1812)")</script>.<br>
<br>On 24 March 1758 Charles Clinton was appointed lieutenant-colonel of James De Lancey's force, and he served in the Anglo-American expedition against Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario in August that year. In 1769 he became first judge of the Ulster county court of common pleas, an appointment he held until his death in Little Britain on 19 November 1773. Of his surviving children, James (1736&#150;1812) served as a revolutionary military officer and was the father of De Witt Clinton (1769&#150;1828), later New York's mayor and state governor. George Clinton became governor of New York and was vice-president of the United States between 1804 and his death in 1812.<br>
