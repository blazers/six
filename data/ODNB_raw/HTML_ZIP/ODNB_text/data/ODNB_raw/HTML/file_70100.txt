<span class="headword">Tucke,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1482, <em>d.</em> in or after 1540), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and musician</span>, was born probably in Burford, Oxfordshire. He was admitted as a scholar to Winchester College in 1495 and took the oath on 7 August 1497. His education continued at New College, Oxford, which he entered as probationary fellow on 20 March 1501; he gained full fellowship on 24 March 1502, and was paid 12<i>d</i>. in 1505&#150;6 &#145;for writing out and notating a mass&#146;  (New College, Oxford, bursars' rolls, 1505&#150;6, &#145;custus capelle&#146;). About Easter 1504 Tucke was admitted to the degree of BA. Thereafter he began studies for the master's degree, but although he supplicated successfully for his MA on 30 March 1507, he appears never to have incepted, instead resigning his fellowship before June of that year to take up a teaching post (in either music or grammar) at Higham Ferrers College, Northamptonshire, where Archbishop Henry Chichele's 1422 statutes provided for a choir of eight chaplains, four clerks, and six choristers.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1515 Tucke was appointed lay master of grammar, master of the boys of the lady chapel, and organist at the Benedictine abbey of St Peter, Gloucester. His duties included teaching grammar to some of the junior monks and to thirteen boys; he was also to teach plainsong, polyphony (<i>cantus divisus</i> or <i>fractus</i>), and descant to five or six boys, and to participate as either singer or organist at high mass and both vespers on feast days. He remained until the dissolution and surrender of the abbey to the crown in 1540, and his services as &#145;master of the children&#146; were subsequently retained by the king's commissioners during the interim before the secular foundation of Gloucester Cathedral, of which it is possible that he became the inaugural organist and master of the choristers.<br>
<br>Tucke was married, perhaps twice. Anne, who may have been his second wife, was cited in various property leases in Gloucester, along with a daughter, Joan, and a son, John. His exact date of death is not known; it is likely that he died in Gloucester and was buried within the cathedral precincts.<br>
<br>Tucke's contribution to the history of music rests largely on the survival of his notebook  (BL, Add. MS 10336), which contains important though often enigmatic theoretical material relating to the notation of early Tudor polyphonic music. The notebook was compiled, mostly in his own hand, over a long period, from his student days at Winchester through to his last years at Gloucester. Part of its contents transmits a number of traditional theoretical texts, including an abbreviated version of the <span class="italic">Libellus cantus mensurabilis</span> attributed to Johannes de Muris, a treatise on musical proportion by John Otteby (Hothby), and notes on Boethian number theory. Much more interesting, however, are the texts (some in English) relating to polyphonic composition, which discuss the notation of rhythmic proportion through complex coloration schemes (blue, green, and yellow in addition to the usual red) and use rare Latin terminology that tries to articulate the manipulation of musical material during the compositional process. Although no compositions by Tucke himself have survived, the practical relevance of this sometimes recondite theoretical work can be traced in the repertories of some of his most notable contemporaries, such as Fayrfax, Taverner, and Ashwell; and even if certain elements of these texts cannot be claimed as wholly original, Tucke's notebook nevertheless remains the fullest exposition of polyphonic music theory surviving in Britain between the 1460s and 1580s. Substantial portions of Tucke's work were further copied and slightly recast by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5212/', "William Chelle")</script> of Hereford, apparently directly from Add. 10336, indicating a personal acquaintance with Tucke, presumably during their time in the west country.<br>
