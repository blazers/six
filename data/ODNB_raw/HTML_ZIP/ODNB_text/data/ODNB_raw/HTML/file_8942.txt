<span class="headword">Evans,  Benjamin</span>  (1740&#150;1821), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 23 February 1740 at Ffynnon Adda, Meline, Pembrokeshire, the son of Daniel Evans, farmer and drover, and his wife, Ann. After attending schools in Gland&#373;r and Monkton, in Pembrokeshire, he completed his formal education at the Haverfordwest grammar school, aged fifteen, without attending a dissenting academy.<br>
<br>Though his father was a Baptist, Evans and his mother joined the Independents at Moylgrove, where he was baptized on 24 March 1764. He began to preach, and undertook a preaching tour through south Wales. Influenced by Lewis Rees, he went to the north in 1768 for a trial period at Llanuwchllyn, Merioneth; being approved, he was ordained minister there in 1769. There were sixty members and 600 &#145;hearers&#146;. He married about 1770 Ann Lloyd, daughter of the Revd Daniel Lloyd of Brynberian; apparently, there were no children. The Independents encountered considerable persecution in north Wales, and he obtained in 1772 a high court judgment compelling the magistrates to register a house for the purpose of worship at Cutiau, near Barmouth. He moved in 1777 to Albany Church, Haverfordwest, and thence to Tre-wen, Cardiganshire, in June 1779, where he remained for over forty years until his death.<br>
<br>Evans was a high Calvinist by persuasion, and steadfastly opposed the advance of Arianism and Arminianism in the area. His predecessor at Tre-wen had Arminian sympathies, but Evans, showing great tact, gradually and successfully led back the congregation to Calvinism. His members founded several new churches, of which he took charge. He was also a pioneer of the Sunday school movement. The distribution of tracts among his members by the Baptists obliged him to defend his position on infant baptism, which he did most ably, bringing him into dispute with William Richards of Lynn, who argued the opposite viewpoint. Evans published (in Welsh) <span class="italic">Letters on Baptism</span> in two editions (1788 and 1789), a translation of Mathias Maurice's <span class="italic">Social Religion</span> (1797), and two works on the sufferings of the black slaves in the West Indies, as well as sermons, catechisms, hymns, and poetry.<br>
<br>Evans was a rather short man of strong and shapely build, with an intense look. An acknowledged leader of his denomination, Evans's services to his countrymen, through the pulpit and the press, were very great. He was taken ill in 1816, and died in Tre-wen on 2 March 1821, survived by his wife. He was buried in Hawen Chapel.<br>
