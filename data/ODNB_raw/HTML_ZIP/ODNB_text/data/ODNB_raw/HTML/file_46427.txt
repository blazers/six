</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williamson,  Henry William</span>  (1895&#150;1977), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 1 December 1895 at 66 Braxfield Road, Brockley, south-east London, the middle child (and only son) of William Leopold Williamson (1865&#150;1946), bank clerk in the City of London, and his wife, Gertrude Eliza (1867&#150;1936), daughter of Thomas and Henrietta Leaver. His paternal grandmother, born Adela Leopoldina L&uuml;hn, was German. In 1900 the family moved to 11 (now 21) Eastern Road, Brockley. This area and era feature in exact detail in early volumes of Williamson's epic novel <span class="italic">A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight</span> (15 vols., 1951&#150;69). A sensitive, difficult child, the young Henry was constantly at odds with his father. In 1907 he obtained a scholarship to Colfe's Grammar School in nearby Lewisham. His great interest at this time was to roam the surrounding countryside making notes about nature. An account of his schooldays can be found in <span class="italic">Dandelion Days</span> (1922) and also in the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>On leaving school in the summer of 1913 Williamson became a clerk in a Sun Fire Insurance office in the City. Already a territorial soldier in the London rifle brigade, he was mobilized when war was declared and was catapulted into a frighteningly different world. His experiences of the First World War, particularly his participation in the Christmas truce of 1914, affected him deeply and became the pivot upon which the rest of his life turned. By the end of the war, Williamson had already determined to be a writer, a decision deepened by reading in June 1919 Richard Jefferies's visionary autobiography <span class="italic">The Story of my Heart</span> (1883), which reinforced his own thinking. In due course Williamson wrote seven books directly about the war: <span class="italic">The Wet Flanders Plain</span> (1929), <span class="italic">The Patriot's Progress</span> (1930), and five volumes of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span> sequence. Many critics consider these to be the finest of the genre.<br>
<br>Demobilized in September 1919, Williamson returned to the family home, where he found it difficult to adjust to post-war conditions. He worked briefly in Fleet Street while continuing to write his first novel. In March 1921 he went to live in the isolated village of Georgeham in north Devon, where he had spent an idyllic holiday in May 1914. <span class="italic">The Beautiful Years</span> (vol. 1 of <span class="italic">The Flax of Dream</span>) was published that October. Other volumes of <span class="italic">Flax</span> followed over the next few years, interspersed with books of nature writing. By the mid-1920s Williamson was an established author. While gaining material for a story about the life of an otter, he met Ida Loetitia (1901&#150;1998), daughter of Charles Hibbert, an official of the Cheriton otter hunt. The Hibberts traced their ancestry in a direct line to Charles II and Nell Gwyn. They married on 6 May 1925 and had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Tarka the Otter</span> was published in 1927 to much acclaim and was awarded the Hawthornden prize. In the novel Williamson brilliantly evoked life&#151;and eventual death&#151;as seen by a hunted otter in the countryside of the two rivers near Torrington and Barnstaple, Devon. With its vivid and sharply observed depiction of natural history, <span class="italic">Tarka</span> has remained a popular classic and Williamson's best-selling work. Presenting the Hawthornden prize, John Galsworthy praised Williamson as &#145;the finest and most intimate living interpreter of the drama of wild life&#146;  (Williamson, <span class="italic">Williamson</span>, xiv). With the prize money Williamson built himself a writing hut in an isolated field above Georgeham. <span class="italic">Tarka</span> attracted the attention of T. E. Lawrence, whose letter of praise started a correspondence and friendship between the two. Indeed, Lawrence's fatal motorcycle crash on 14 May 1935 occurred as he was returning from a trip to the post office to send a telegram to Williamson, who later wrote a memoir of his friendship with Lawrence, <span class="italic">Genius of Friendship</span> (1941).<br>
<br>In 1929 Williamson moved his family to Shallowford, a secluded cottage at Filleigh near South Molton, Devon. In 1931 he met Ann (Myfanwy) Thomas, daughter of the writer Edward Thomas, who became his secretary and with whom he had a daughter. In 1932 he was approached by the artist C. F. Tunnicliffe, whose subsequent illustration of Williamson's work was an inspired collaboration. During the Shallowford sojourn Williamson published ten more books including <span class="italic">The Gold Falcon</span> (1933), arising from a visit to the USA, and <span class="italic">Salar the Salmon</span> (1935).<br>
<br>In September 1935 Williamson was invited by his great friend John Heygate, the writer, to visit him in Berlin; Heygate officially provided tickets for the Nuremberg rally. Williamson was extraordinarily impressed by all that he was shown by officials in Germany and did not hesitate to make his views known. He saw Hitler as a man achieving great good for his country, who as a former soldier would never contemplate another war. This na&iuml;ve attitude was misunderstood by the establishment, and Williamson was vilified for his opinions.<br>
<br>In 1936 Williamson bought a rundown farm in north Norfolk, and in November 1937 he was introduced there to Sir Oswald Mosley, whose views on agricultural reform coincided with his own and whom he thought the only politician strong enough to prevent a repetition of war. He described Mosley as &#145;A fine fellow: strong, determined, integrated, [with] staying-power&#146;  (Williamson, <span class="italic">Williamson</span>, 222). Williamson wrote eight articles on the agricultural situation for Mosley's journal <span class="italic">Action</span>, and also joined the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96364', "British Union of Fascists")</script>. He remained a member until the movement was banned at the outbreak of the Second World War. He was not, however, a political fascist; he was a Romantic with a mistaken concept of the situation.<br>
<br>Williamson's Norfolk neighbours viewed this eccentric newcomer with great suspicion, their unfounded complaints that he was a spy leading to his arrest in June 1940 and a weekend in the local police station before he was released unconditionally. The difficult farm era is recorded in <span class="italic">The Story of a Norfolk Farm</span> (1941) and two volumes of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>. He was very proud when his farm achieved &#145;A&#146; category. Exhausted at the end of the war, he sold the farm in October 1945. After settling the family in Suffolk he returned to Georgeham alone, and was divorced in 1947. In the summer of 1948 he met a young teacher, Christine Mary Duffield (1921&#150;1990). They married on 13 April 1949, had one son, separated in December 1962, and were divorced in 1968.<br>
<br>With the return to Devon, Williamson immersed himself in <span class="italic">A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight</span> (1951&#150;1969), his fifteen-volume masterpiece encompassing a portrait of life in the first half of the twentieth century. This mammoth task exhausted him but he wrote one further book, <span class="italic">The Scandaroon</span> (1972).<br>
<br>Succumbing to senile dementia, Williamson was taken in 1976 into the care of Twyford Abbey Nursing Home in Ealing on the outskirts of London, where he died on 13 August 1977. He was buried on 18 August in the churchyard of St George's parish church, Georgeham. A memorial service with address by Ted Hughes (1930&#150;1998, poet laureate) was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 1 December 1977.<br>
<br>Altogether Henry Williamson wrote over fifty books and innumerable articles (many of these now collected into books published by the Henry Williamson Society). His work falls within the Romantic genre. The critic George Painter stated: &#145;He stands at the end of the line of Blake, Shelley and Jefferies: he is the last classic and the last romantic.&#146;<br>
