<span class="headword">Deane, Sir  James Parker</span>  (1812&#150;1902), <span class="occ">judge</span>, the second son of Henry Boyle Deane of Hurst Grove, Berkshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of James Wyborn of Hull House, Shelden, Kent, was born at Hurst Grove on 25 June 1812. He went to Winchester as a colleger in 1824, and matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 29 June 1829, as a law fellow of founder's kin. In 1833 he obtained a second class in the final classical school and a third in the final mathematical school. He graduated BCL on 28 May 1834, proceeded DCL on 10 April 1839, and was admitted a member of the College of Advocates on 2 November following. He had entered the Inner Temple as a student on 8 November 1837, and on 29 January 1841 he was called to the bar by that society. He was made a QC on 16 January 1858, and became a bencher of his inn on 30 April 1858; he served in the office of treasurer in 1878. Deane wrote &#145;On the exercise of private judgement&#146; for the clergy, produced work on the law of blockade, and edited the <span class="roman">Wills Act Amendment Act</span> of 1852.<br>
<br>In 1854 Deane was appointed legal adviser to Admiral Sir Charles Napier, who commanded the British fleet in the Baltic. He was present on board HMS <i>Duke of Wellington</i> at the bombardment of Bomarsund, and formed one of the landing party. On the abolition of Doctors' Commons in 1858 Deane transferred to the courts of probate and divorce, where he obtained a large practice. An effective speaker and a vigorous advocate, he adapted himself to juries and to the <i>viva voce</i> examination of witnesses more readily than some of his colleagues. His most conspicuous appearances, however, were in the ecclesiastical courts, in which the practice and the traditions of &#145;the Commons&#146; still flourished, and for a quarter of a century there were few ecclesiastical cases of interest or importance in which Deane was not retained; the most celebrated of these, perhaps, were those of <i>Boyd v. Phillpotts</i>, in which the legality of the Exeter reredos was challenged, <i>Rugg v. Kingsmill</i>, and <i>Rugg v. Bishop of Winchester</i>. He also appeared in the case of <i>Martin v. Mackonochie</i>, which began in 1867 and lasted until 1882; in its earlier stages he appeared on behalf of the defendant.<br>
<br>Deane was a strong Conservative in politics, and in the general election of November 1868 he contested the City of Oxford against Edward Cardwell and William Vernon Harcourt but was heavily defeated. In 1872 he was appointed vicar-general of the province and diocese of Canterbury on the resignation of Sir Travers Twiss; he had already been made chancellor of the diocese of Salisbury in 1868 by Bishop Hamilton. In 1868 he also became Admiralty advocate-general. From 1872 to 1886, under the title of legal adviser to the Foreign Office, he carried out the duties of the now obsolete office of queen's advocate. In this capacity he prepared the British case in the arbitration between Great Britain and Portugal over the territory south of Delagoa Bay, and he advised the government throughout the long disputes arising from the action of the <i>Alabama</i> and her consorts in the American Civil War.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1885 Deane was knighted and in 1892 he was sworn of the privy council. His duties as vicar-general did not interfere with his forensic work, and he held the leading brief in the famous case of the missing will of the first Lord St Leonards, tried in 1876. He continued to practise at the bar until increasing deafness forced him to retire. In 1890 he sat as vicar-general beside Archbishop Benson and his episcopal assessors in the proceedings against Bishop Edward King of Lincoln, and on the occasion of the confirmation of Winnington Ingram as bishop of London at Bow church on 17 April 1901 the turbulent conduct of the &#145;opposers&#146; almost got beyond his power of control. His last public appearance was at the confirmation of Dr Francis Paget as bishop of Oxford a few months later.<br>
<br>Deane and Dr T. H. Tristram QC (<i>d</i>. 1912) were the last of the &#145;civilians&#146; trained in &#145;the Commons&#146; and they were described in Dickens's <span class="italic">David Copperfield</span> and Warren's <span class="italic">Ten Thousand a Year</span>. Deane married Isabella Frances (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of Bargrave Wyborn, at Eastry in 1841. He died at his home, 16 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 3 January 1902, having resigned his offices a few days previously. He was buried at Brookwood cemetery. The only son to survive him was Sir Henry Bargrave Deane, a judge of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice, and the author of <span class="italic">The Law of Blockade</span> (1870).<br>
