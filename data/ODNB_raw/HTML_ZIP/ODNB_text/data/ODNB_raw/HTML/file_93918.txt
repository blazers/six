<span class="headword">Jewell,  Norman Limbury Auchinleck <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">submariner and naval officer</span>, was born on 24 October 1913 in the Seychelles, the elder son of Norman Parsons Jewell, colonial medical officer, and his wife, Sydney. He was educated at Oundle School from 1926 to 1931. In 1933 he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, serving on HMS <i>Royal Oak</i> in the Mediterranean. After promotion to sub-lieutenant he became a submariner in 1936, serving in HMS <i>Clyde</i>, then HMS <i>Dwarf</i>, a service vessel. Following the outbreak of the Second World War he was transferred as first lieutenant to HMS <i>Otway</i>, then HMS <i>Truant</i>, being much inspired by the commander of the latter, Lieutenant-Commander Hugh Haggard, whose daring exploits included penetrating the dense minefield off Tripoli in order to harass Italian shipping. In 1941 he passed the &#145;perisher&#146; course (the submarine commanding officers' course) at HMS <i>Dolphin</i>, and was given command of HMS <i>L27</i>, then of HMS <i>P219</i>, shortly renamed HMS <i>Seraph</i>. His command of the latter almost came to a premature end in July 1942 when, off Norway, the submarine was mistaken for a German vessel and strafed by the RAF.<br>
<br>Assigned to the Mediterranean in the autumn of 1942, during the build-up to operation Torch (the allied invasion of north Africa), Jewell was given the task of transporting the American general Mark Clark and his staff, accompanied by a small detachment of Royal Marines, to Algeria for clandestine negotiations with the Vichy French commanders. Clark's negotiations proved disappointing, mainly because of the chaotic and faction-ridden nature of the Vichy command structure, and Jewell had to effect a hasty rescue of the general and his party after their presence had been betrayed. Jewell and <i>Seraph</i> were then chosen to extricate General Henri Giraud from Vichy France, where he was in hiding after escaping from German internment. Giraud was thought by Clark to be the key to uniting and winning over the Vichy forces in north Africa. Nevertheless, such was Giraud's dislike of the British that he had insisted on being picked up by an American vessel. As a consequence HMS <i>Seraph</i> was renamed USS <i>Seraph</i>, and put under the nominal command of an American, Captain Jerauld Wright. After a hair-raising five-night wait off the coast of southern France <i>Seraph</i> picked up Giraud and took him to a rendezvous with a Catalina flying boat, Jewell and his crew all the while doing their best to speak in American accents. Jewell was appointed MBE in February 1943 for his role in this operation. (Much later he was also awarded the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and the Croix de Guerre with palm.)<br>
<br>In April 1943 Jewell was entrusted with one of the most secret operations of the entire war, when he and <i>Seraph</i> were given a key role in operation Mincemeat, the allied plan devised by Ewen Montagu to deceive the Germans about the forthcoming invasion of Sicily. Jewell took delivery on the Clyde of a metal container, which he told his crew contained special optical instruments. In fact it contained, packed in dry ice, an unidentified corpse dressed as a Royal Marines officer, &#145;Major William Martin&#146;, handcuffed to a briefcase containing forged documents purportedly showing that the attack on Sicily would be a feint, designed to draw attention from the &#145;real&#146; allied landings in Corsica, Sardinia, and Greece. The corpse was given other, supposedly authentic, documents, including theatre ticket stubs and letters from a father and girlfriend. Jewell took the container to a designated point off the coast of southern Spain then, after ordering his crew&#151;except his second-in-command, David Scott, and two others&#151;below deck, opened it and, after an impromptu funeral service, dumped the body, together with an upturned RAF dinghy, in the sea. The body was duly washed ashore at Huelva. The British authorities were informed, death notices appeared in the British press announcing that Major Martin had died as a result of an aircraft accident, the body was buried in Huelva with full military honours, and the man's girlfriend sent a wreath. The briefcase was duly returned, but only after the Spanish authorities had copied its contents to the Germans. The ruse worked spectacularly: fortifications on Corsica were built up, a Waffen SS brigade was moved to Sardinia, General Rommel was sent to Greece to bolster its defences, and&#151;by order of Hitler himself&#151;two Panzer divisions were withdrawn from the battle of Kursk to prepare to move to Greece. Two and a half months later the allied invasion of Sicily met far less resistance than had been anticipated; here <i>Seraph</i> again played an important role, laying marker buoys for the incoming vessels&#151;a dangerous operation for which Jewell was subsequently awarded the American Legion of Merit. Operation Mincemeat remained clouded in secrecy for many years, and Jewell made no mention of it in his one book, the wartime <span class="italic">Secret Mission Submarine</span> (1944). Nevertheless Duff Cooper's novel <span class="italic">Operation Heartbreak</span> (1950) fictionalized the episode (much to the chagrin of the Admiralty), and in 1953 it was the subject of two books, Ian Colvin's <span class="italic">The Unknown Courier</span> and Ewen Montagu's <span class="italic">The Man Who Never Was</span>. The latter, which sold over 2 million copies, was turned into a film, in 1956, in which Jewell was played by William Squire.<br>
<br>Throughout his time in command of <i>Seraph</i> Jewell was also engaged in more conventional submarine operations, and by the time he relinquished command and was given home leave, at the end of 1943, it was estimated that he had sunk 7000 tons of enemy shipping and damaged a further 10,000 tons. He was awarded the DSC in April 1944 for his Mediterranean patrols. He spent two months in Washington, DC, attached to the naval staff, and was promoted lieutenant-commander in August 1944; he then commanded the submarines HMS <i>Seanymph</i> and HMS <i>Trespasser</i> in home waters until the end of the war. On 18 November 1944 he married Rosemary Patricia Galloway, a 25-year-old Women's Royal Naval Service officer, and daughter of William Galloway, shipping merchant. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>After the war Jewell commanded several submarines, and in 1948 (promoted commander) was given charge of the 3rd submarine flotilla. He was promoted captain in 1953. His subsequent career included spells as commanding officer of the Rhine flotilla, director of the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich, and on the staff of Lord Mountbatten, first sea lord and chief of the defence staff. From 1962 to 1963 he was naval aide-de-camp to the queen. He retired from the navy in 1963 and for many years worked for Mitchell and Butler, the Birmingham brewery, while also serving as life president of the Submarine Old Comrades' Association. His wife died in 1996, and in 1998 he suffered a fall which broke his neck and confined him to a wheelchair. His last years were spent at the Royal Star and Garter Home in Richmond, where he died on 18 August 2004. He was survived by his three children.<br>
