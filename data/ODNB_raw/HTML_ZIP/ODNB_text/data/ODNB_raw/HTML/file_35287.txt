<span class="headword">O'Conor,  Charles Owen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>O'Conor Don]</span>  (1838&#150;1906), <span class="occ">landlord in Ireland and politician</span>, was born on 7 May 1838 in Dublin. He was the eldest son of Denis O'Conor of Belanagare and Clonallis, co. Roscommon, and Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blake, daughter of Major Blake of Towerhill, co. Mayo. The O'Conors were among Ireland's most ancient and renowned Catholic families. Charles's father, MP for co. Roscommon from 1831 to 1847, died when he was a child, leaving him large estates in Roscommon and Sligo.<br>
<br>O'Conor was educated at the Benedictine public school St Gregory's College, Downside, near Bath, and in 1855 entered London University, but did not take a degree. He was married twice: first, on 21 April 1868, to Georgina Mary (<i>d</i>. 1872), the third daughter of Thomas A. Perry of Warwickshire; they had four sons. Seven years after Georgina's death he married Ellen, the third daughter of John S. More O'Ferrall, of Granite Hall, Kingstown, and Lisard, Edgeworthstown, co. Longford. Coming from a Catholic landed family, O'Conor was destined to play a significant role in political life. He was made her majesty's lieutenant and <i>custos rotulorum</i> of co. Roscommon in 1858; and at the parliamentary by-election on 26 March 1860 he was returned unopposed as a Liberal for that county, which he represented until his defeat in the general election of 1880. Although not particularly skilled as a debater, he enjoyed considerable influence in the House of Commons because of his mastery of detail. He took particular interest in education, land tenure, prisons, workshop conditions, Irish Sunday closing, state purchase of Ireland's railways, grand jury reform, the taxation of Ireland, and Catholic issues generally. During his lifetime he wrote pamphlets on Irish taxation, land tenure, and education. His immense local status and close connections with the Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy made him a valuable channel of communication between Westminster politicians and Catholic clergy.<br>
<br>O'Conor stood unopposed for re-election as a Liberal in the general elections of 1865 and 1868. In the early 1870s he flirted with the home-rule movement, attending and speaking at the national conference held in Dublin in November 1873 which founded the Home Rule League. During the proceedings he expressed reservations about the precise formulation of home rule, but nevertheless stood as a home-ruler at the general election of 1874 and was once again returned unopposed; his younger brother Denis O'Conor was elected without a contest for Sligo in the home-rule interest at the same election. Although O'Conor declined to join the newly formed Home Rule Party, he gave it independent support. During the debate on home rule in June 1874 he expressed reservations about its application to Ireland and in subsequent years opposed the party on various questions. During these years he advocated the extension of the &#145;Ulster custom&#146;, giving tenants the right to sell their &#145;interest&#146; in their holdings, to the rest of Ireland. He played a significant part in negotiations leading to the <span class="roman">Irish Intermediate Education Act</span> in 1878 and was involved in the discussions of the <span class="roman">University Act</span> of the following year. His interest in education and contribution to the Royal University, where he was a member of senate for many years, led to the conferment of an honorary LLD in 1892. Although standing as a home-ruler at the general election of 1880, he was one of those old-style MPs displaced by a follower of Charles Stewart Parnell. O'Conor made one further attempt to re-enter the House of Commons, contesting Wexford borough against W. H. K. Redmond, brother of the Irish nationalist John Redmond, at the by-election on 27 July 1883, when he was defeated decisively.<br>
<br>O'Conor's chief political role was as a member of numerous committees and commissions and in local administration. He served on the penal servitude commission (1862), the factories and workshops commission (1875), the registration of deeds commission (1878), the land law commission (1880), the reformatories and industrial schools commission (1882), and the royal commission on the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland (1894). On the death of H. C. E. Childers in 1896 he became chairman of this last body, a post he held at the time it reported. His involvement in local administration was also extensive. He was a magistrate, deputy lord lieutenant of Roscommon from 1888 until his death, and was elected to the Roscommon county council following its creation under the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1898. He was also a member of the intermediate education board and of the executive committee of the Irish landowners' convention.<br>
<br>O'Conor also took a strong interest in Irish history and language. He was for many years president of the Antiquarian Society of Ireland, president of the Royal Irish Academy, and president of the Irish Language Society. In 1881 he was sworn of the Irish privy council. He secured the introduction of the Irish language into the curriculum of the intermediate education board, while his interest in antiquarianism resulted in the publication in 1891 of a history of the O'Conors of Connaught. O'Conor died at his home, Clonallis, Castlerea, co. Roscommon, on 30 June 1906, leaving an estate valued at &pound;33,272 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., of which &pound;6937 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. was in England. On 5 July he was buried in the new cemetery, Castlerea.<br>
