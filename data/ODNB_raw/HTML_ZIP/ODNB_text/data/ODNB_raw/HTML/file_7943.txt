<span class="headword">Douglass,  John</span>  (1743?&#150;1812), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the London district</span>, was born at Yarm, Yorkshire, probably in December 1743, the son of John Douglass, originally from Scotland, whose occupation is unknown, and his wife, Bridget Semson. His sister Ann became a Carmelite nun. He was educated by the secular priest Simon Bordley at Salwick Hall, Lancashire, and from October 1757 at the English College, Douai. After ordination and after graduating DD, he set out on 20 May 1768 with eight students from Douai to the English College, Valladolid, from which the Jesuits had recently been expelled. Here he taught humanities and philosophy, a contemporary noting:<blockquote>He is young and has a great narrowness of mind and thinking, as yet; such persons stick close to their own few ideas, and to try and persuade them directly not to cleave to their own preconceived and narrow notions, is the way to throw them entirely off their hinges and to get their ill will for one's pains. (Williams, 76)</blockquote>Owing to ill health he left Valladolid on 30 July 1773 and became a mission priest at Linton upon Ouse, Newton upon Ouse, and York by 24 March 1776.<br>
<br>In 1790 he was chosen to succeed James Talbot as vicar apostolic of the London district against the wishes of the Catholic Committee, composed of liberal lay Catholics, who insisted that he was being &#145;imposed by a foreign power&#146;  (Nelson, 146). The success of the conservative vicars apostolic in having Douglass appointed against the wishes of the leading laity suggests a decline in the gentry's influence on English Catholicism. He was consecrated on 19 December 1790 as bishop of Centuria <i>in partibus infidelium</i>&#151;in the chapel at Lulworth Castle, Dorset&#151;by Dr William Gibson, the northern vicar apostolic, the Jesuit Charles Plowden giving a discourse on episcopal authority. The Catholic committee&#151;which demanded that bishops be elected, and campaigned for Catholic emancipation, a reduction of papal influence in England, and more accommodation with the British government&#151;identified him, not altogether correctly, as siding with the conservative vicars apostolic. Douglass certainly provided his fellow bishops with essential information, and was in communication with politicians like William Pitt the younger and Edmund Burke, whom he called &#145;our sincere friend&#146;  (diary, 72). In the interests of unity he supported the substitution of the Irish oath of allegiance, adopted from the 1779 <span class="roman">Irish Catholic Relief Act</span>, and this was included in the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> which became law on 24 June 1791.<br>
<br>Douglass exploited the new opportunities brought about by the act, helping religious orders to establish themselves, and he began publishing an annual &#145;new year's gift&#146; and Lenten pastoral letter. About 1790 he had moved to his official residence at 4 Castle Street, Holborn, where, in his wainscoted study, surrounded by portraits of English Catholic clergy and martyrs yellow with smoke, Douglass, a tall thin man in a &#145;suit of black, not very fresh, with a little close white wig&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Catholic London</span>, 64), would openly wear his pectoral cross and amethyst ring. Despite some protestant opposition, he began to pontificate with mitre and crosier at high mass in the new London chapels, and in 1805 ordered a <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> and prayers for the royal family after Trafalgar. After 1791 he acted as mediator in further disputes between the orthodox party and the Catholic Committee, now called the Cisalpine Club, and remained a close friend of the leading Cisalpine, Charles Butler. From 1792 until 1801 he struggled with another Cisalpine, Sir John Throckmorton, by refusing to give priestly faculties to his outspoken and liberal chaplain, Joseph Berington. It was hard for one so mild as he to resort to harsh measures; in the parable of the tares, he saw &#145;encouragement to leave doubtful doctrine uncondemned till the Last Day&#146;  (Duffy, &#145;Doctor Douglass&#146;, 262), and therefore more aggressive bishops, like John Milner, insinuated that he had &#145;deserted the faith of his fathers&#146;  (Duffy, &#145;Ecclesiastical democracy&#146;, part III, 125). Still, his enhancement of episcopal authority can be said to have paved the way for the grand Catholic prelates of the following century. He remained from 1808 a determined opponent of the veto by which the crown would exercise some control over episcopal appointments. In the apocalyptic gloom of the 1790s he had to face the problem of hundreds of &eacute;migr&eacute; clergy without direction or means of livelihood swarming into London during the French Revolution, and insisted that they, as well as the Irish in the capital, be subject to his immediate jurisdiction. In 1808 he suspended the Blanchardist schismatics who opposed Pius VII's concordat of 1801 with Napoleon.<br>
<br>To ensure a continuity of Catholic education after the closure of English institutions in France during the Revolution, Douglass used his influence and financial resources to begin in November 1793 the foundation of a college at his property at Old Hall Green, Hertfordshire, as the successor of Douai College in France, which ultimately became the seminary of St Edmund, Ware. He appointed its president and was a frequent visitor. After a long illness Douglass died at his residence, 4 Castle Street, Holborn, London, on 8 May 1812, leaving money in his will to his brother James, at Ealing, and to his two nephews. He was buried at St Pancras churchyard on 15 May 1812, and in 1906 his remains were translated to St Edmund's, Ware. He was &#145;a man of unusual kindness of disposition, with a calmness of judgment and action in keeping with his Scotch descent, while by no means wanting in firmness when occasion demanded&#146;  (Ward, <span class="italic">Catholic London</span>, 64).<br>
