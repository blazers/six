<span class="headword">Balfour, Sir  Andrew</span>, first baronet  (1630&#150;1694), <span class="occ">botanist and antiquary</span>, was born at Balfour Castle, Denmiln, Fife, on 18 January 1630, the fifth and youngest son in the large family of Sir Michael Balfour and his wife, Jane or Joanna (<i>d</i>. 1640), daughter of Sir James Durham of Pitkerro. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1189/', "Sir James Balfour, first baronet (1600&#150;1657)")</script>, the antiquary. Andrew Balfour was brought up at Balfour Castle, the family seat. After an early education at the parish school of Abdie he studied philosophy under Thomas Gleig at St Andrews University and graduated MA about 1650. Encouraged by his brother James to be a keen collector of literary, antiquarian, and natural history objects, and by then an aspiring medical student, he probably visited Oxford and London before travelling to France in 1657, primarily to see the gardens of the duc d'Orl&eacute;ans at Blois. These beautiful gardens were superintended by Robert Morison with whom Balfour struck up a friendship. He then lived for several years in Paris, undertaking the most advanced medical education available in Europe; he went on to Montpellier, and then graduated MD at Caen on 20 September 1661.<br>
<br>Arriving afterwards in London, Balfour became acquainted with many famous physicians of the day, including Harvey, Glisson, Charleton, and Wedderburn, the king's physician, and was presented to Charles II. The king recognized Balfour as an exceptionally cultivated man and acquired for him a position as tutor to the wayward young earl of Rochester, John Wilmot, whom he accompanied on a grand tour from 1661 to 1664. Balfour made good use of his time abroad, especially in Padua and Bologna, and gathered a magnificent collection of medical and natural history books, curiosities, medals, instruments, pictures, and busts. His taste and varied interests are well shown in letters to Patrick Murray, laird of Livingstone, which were collected by Balfour's son for anonymous publication as <span class="italic">Letters Written to a Friend</span> (1700).<br>
<br>In 1667 Balfour went to live in St Andrews where he practised as a physician, collected local plants, experimented in science and medicine, and made anatomical dissections  (<span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>, 1803, 752). But he soon got bored with St Andrews and moved in 1670 to Edinburgh where he built up another medical practice. At this point he is reputed to have experimented on blood transfusions in dogs. In Edinburgh he started a small botanical garden in which he grew a number of exotic species, enhanced by Murray's collection and by seeds from European botanists and from Morison, now at Oxford. It is not clear if this is the same garden he indubitably took on with Robert Sibbald, a distant cousin, in 1670 at St Anne's Yards, near Holyrood Abbey. Balfour appointed James Sutherland as first curator, and bore the cost of the salary until he persuaded the university to take the garden over as an adjunct to the medical school. In 1675 a larger plot next to Trinity Church and Hospital (now underneath Waverley Station) was acquired, to which Balfour transferred many of his plants. Sutherland's catalogue of 1684 reveals that there were some 2000 non-indigenous species growing in the garden. Balfour continued to act as patron to the garden.<br>
<br>Balfour played a prominent role in Edinburgh's learned society, and opened his remarkable private museum, gallery, and library to scholars. He was also active in establishing professorial chairs in Edinburgh University (making sure to place his own candidate, James Gregory, in mathematics) and in founding the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He became its third president in 1685. He improved the infirmary and arranged publication of the first <span class="italic">Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia</span> (1685), in which he wrote the parts on materia medica. He was created baronet (at an unknown date) and physician-in-ordinary to Charles II. Balfour's old age was uncomfortable with gout and other disorders, and he died on 9 or 10 January 1694, suddenly while walking in the street. His wife, about whom little is known, apparently predeceased him; there was certainly one son, Michael Balfour, of Northbank, who served as executor. Balfour was buried in Greyfriars kirkyard, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Most of Balfour's collections were broken up after his death. The library was sold, and its contents are listed in <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Balfouriana</span> (1695). The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh holds only a manuscript list of &#145;Plants I have seen&#146;. He left his valuable collection of medical and scientific manuscripts to Robert Sibbald; this is also presumed sold. The medical and natural history specimens (listed in <span class="italic">Auctarium musaei Balfouriani</span>, 1697), which included a rattlesnake and a crocodile, were purchased by the city for Edinburgh University although hardly any items survive. His <span class="italic">Letters written to a Friend &hellip; containing excellent direction and advices for travelling thro' France and Italy</span>, originally intended for Patrick Murray, laird of Livingstone, was published posthumously in 1700. Sibbald produced an authoritative account of Balfour's life, much of which is repeated in translation in John Walker's <span class="italic">Essays on Natural History</span> and in various biographical dictionaries.<br>
