<span class="headword">Borthwick,  Peter</span>  (1804&#150;1852), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, only son of Thomas Borthwick of Edinburgh, was born at Cornbank, in the parish of Borthwick, Midlothian, on 13 September 1804; he graduated at the University of Edinburgh, and was the private pupil of James Walker, bishop of Edinburgh and Glasgow, and afterwards primus of the Episcopal Church of Scotland. He undertook some tutoring and, despite the objections of her uncle and guardian, married on 8 January 1827 his pupil Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1864), daughter of John Colville of Ewart, Northumberland; they had three children. Although he was married, Borthwick matriculated from Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1828, migrating in February 1830 to be a fellow-commoner of Downing College. While at Cambridge, he published <span class="italic">A Brief Statement &hellip; Concerning the Second Advent of our Blessed Lord</span> (1830); at that time he contemplated ordination. He was a good-looking man with an olive complexion and a &#145;profusion of black hair&#146;  (Escott, 187).<br>
<br>In 1832 Borthwick began a series of speeches opposing the abolition of the slave trade, which gained him rapid fame and the thanks of various slave owners and Conservative associations. His views were contested in a lively series of responses by Samuel Bowly and others. Borthwick unsuccessfully stood for Evesham as a Conservative in 1832, but was elected in 1835. He lost the seat on petition in 1838, but was elected for it in 1841. He associated with the Young England group, opposed the move to free trade, and in the general election of 1847 contested&#151;unsuccessfully in both cases&#151;St Ives and Penryn as a Conservative. Borthwick's political career did not reflect his early promise. His speeches &#145;were apt to provoke not so much cheers as yawns&#146;  (Escott, 186). However, he amended the <span class="roman">Poor Law Amendment Act</span> through what became known as the &#145;Borthwick clause&#146;, by which married couples over the age of sixty were not required to separate when living in the workhouse.<br>
<br>On 28 April 1847 Borthwick was called to the bar at Gray's Inn. His career at the bar made little headway, and in the late 1840s he failed in his attempt to enter the Foreign Office. In 1849 he resorted to journalism, becoming manager of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. After a complex series of financial intrigues, he became editor in 1850. Described in 1849 by Lord Malmesbury as &#145;a paid spy of Palmerston's&#146;, Borthwick as editor strongly supported Lord Palmerston, though without estranging Conservative readers  (Koss, 80&#150;81) and still supporting protection. Already ill when he became editor, Borthwick's health declined, and he died from pleurisy at his home, 11 Walton Villas, Brompton, London, on 18 December 1852. The editorship of the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> soon passed to his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31973/', "Algernon Borthwick, Baron Glenesk")</script>.<br>
