<span class="headword">Willan,  Robert</span>  (1757&#150;1812), <span class="occ">physician and dermatologist</span>, was born on 12 November 1757 at Hill, near Sedbergh in Yorkshire, the younger son of Robert Willan (1717&#150;1777), a man-midwife, and his wife, Ann Weatherald. He received his early education at Sedbergh grammar school where he became an accomplished classicist. In 1777 Willan went to Edinburgh to study medicine at the university and graduated MD on 24 June 1780 with a thesis on inflammation of the liver. He completed his education by attending lectures in London, where he met and won the support of John Fothergill, a fellow Quaker.<br>
<br>Willan had been promised the practice of a relative, John Trotter, and on his death in 1781 he travelled north to Darlington to begin work. However, Willan found two rivals already ensconced there, and after only a year he gave up the contest and instead set up in practice in London. Through Quaker patronage he supplemented his private practice with posts in the new dispensaries springing up in London. Willan was appointed physician to the Public Dispensary in 1783, and later held similar posts at the Finsbury Dispensary and the Fever Institution. He briefly used the Public Dispensary as a base from which to deliver lecture courses. This was unsuccessful, but a scheme to take on pupils there proved popular. In 1785 Willan became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians by examination and in 1791 he was elected to the Society of Antiquaries. Willan attended Quaker meetings in London until 17 July 1800 when he was formally disowned for his marriage by non-Quaker rites. It is possible that his wife was Eleanor Pool and that they had married at St Luke's, Old Street, Finsbury, on 15 February 1798.<br>
<br>Willan's reputation rests on his contribution to nosology&#151;that archetypal eighteenth-century enterprise of classifying disease&#151;through a seminal work on the description and categorization of skin complaints. At the time a number of practitioners produced new classificatory schemes of skin diseases, realizing that the existing terminology, based on classical authors, was inexact and did not cover all known conditions. Willan worked on the problem from 1784 and in 1790 he laid out his new classification to a meeting of the Medical Society of London. His division of skin disease into eight groups according to their structure and appearance quickly won the approval of the profession. By 1801 Willan was an acknowledged expert on the subject and was able to give up his dispensary posts and build a private practice based on his specialist knowledge. In recognition of his work he was awarded the Fothergill medal in 1790, and in 1809 was elected to the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Willan set out to publish a comprehensive account of the appearance and treatment of all skin diseases, arranged according to his classification. Between 1798 and 1806 he produced works on his first four disease categories&#151;the papulae, squamae, exanthemata, and bullae&#151;all vividly illustrated with coloured plates. These were collected as <span class="italic">On Cutaneous Diseases</span> (1808). The remainder of his classificatory scheme was published after his death by Ashby Smith, who saw Willan's manuscript on porrigo through the press, and by Thomas Bateman, whose much reprinted <span class="italic">Practical Synopsis of Cutaneous Diseases</span> (1813) provided an abstract of the complete classification. In addition to his <i>magnum opus</i> Willan also published <span class="italic">On Vaccine Inoculation</span> (1806) which described the skin lesions produced by vaccination and the diseases most commonly mistaken for subsequent smallpox.<br>
<br>Willan's other medical works reflected another typically eighteenth-century concern&#151;the effects of the environment upon health and disease. During his brief stay in Darlington he produced <span class="italic">Observations on the Sulphur Waters of Croft</span> (1782) which analysed the chemical content of some local springs and advocated their use for a number of chronic ailments. In 1794 he edited John Whitehurst's <span class="italic">Observations on the Ventilation of Rooms</span>. From 1796 to 1800 Willan published monthly accounts of the weather and the prevailing diseases in London in the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Medical and Physical Journal</span>, which were subsequently collected as <span class="italic">Reports on the Diseases of London</span> (1801). An <span class="italic">Account of the Dreadful Effects of Dram-Drinking</span> (with advice on how to give up the habit) was extracted from the <span class="italic">Reports</span> and published by the Society for Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor in 1803. Willan also produced one religious work&#151;an account of the life of Christ, drawn from the gospels, published in 1782.<br>
<br>From 1810 Willan began to show symptoms of tuberculosis. In 1811 he moved out of London to Craven Hill, although he continued to travel into the city to attend patients. On 10 October 1811 Willan sailed with his family to Madeira. The climate temporarily alleviated his condition, allowing him to continue work on his manuscripts on skin disease. He died on 12 April 1812 at Funchal and was buried there in the English burial-ground.<br>
