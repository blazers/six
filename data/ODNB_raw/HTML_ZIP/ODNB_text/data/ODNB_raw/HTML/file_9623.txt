<span class="headword">Fitzpatrick,  Richard</span>, first Baron Gowran  (<em>c.</em>1662&#150;1727), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, may have been the son or grandson of Andrew Fitzpatrick of Castle Fleming and his wife, Ellice, daughter of Richard Butler, Viscount Mountgarret. He is believed to have been a kinsman of but not, as was formerly thought, the son of John Fitzpatrick of Castletown, Queen's county  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 6.39). Richard Fitzpatrick entered the Royal Navy and was appointed on 14 May 1687 commander of the <i>Richmond</i>. On 24 May 1688 he was made captain of the <i>Assurance</i>, from which in 1689 he was transferred to the <i>Lark</i>, in which he cruised against the French in the North Sea. Having distinguished himself on that station, he was advanced on 11 January 1690 to the command of the <i>St Alban's</i>, a fourth-rate, with which on 18 July he captured off Rame Head a 36-gun French frigate after a four-hour fight.<br>
<br>In February 1691 Fitzpatrick drove on shore two French frigates and helped to cut out fourteen merchantmen from a convoy of twenty-two. In command of the <i>Burford</i> (70 guns) he served under Lord Berkeley in 1696, and in July he was detached to make a descent on the Groix, an island near Belle &Icirc;le off the west coast of Brittany, from which he took 1300 head of cattle, with horses, boats, and small vessels. He was promoted to the command of the <i>Ranelagh</i> (80 guns) on the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, and took part in the duke of Ormond's mismanaged expedition against Cadiz (1702), and in the successful attack on Vigo which followed; but soon after this he retired from the service. In 1696 he had received a grant of the town and lands of Grantstown and elsewhere in Queen's county. He sat as MP for Harristown in the Irish House of Commons between 1703 and 1713, and for Queen's county from 1713 to 1715. On 27 April 1715 he was raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Gowran of Gowran, co. Kilkenny. He took his seat on 12 November, and on 14 November he helped to prepare an address to George I, congratulating him upon his accession. In July 1718 Fitzpatrick married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1744), the second youngest daughter of Sir John Robinson of Farmingwood, Northamptonshire; the couple had two sons, John and Richard. Fitzpatrick died on 9 June 1727 and was buried at Grafton, Underwood, on 21 June.<br>
<br>Fitzpatrick's elder son, John(1719&#150;1758), was promoted to the Irish earldom of Upper Ossory on 5 October 1751. He married Evelyn, daughter of John Leveson-Gower, second Earl Gower, and their children included the politician and soldier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9624/', "Richard Fitzpatrick")</script>.<br>
