<span class="headword">Rodocanachi,  Michael Emmanuel</span>  (1821&#150;1901), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, was born on 14 December 1821 on the Turkish island of Kh&iacute;os, the third of five children of Emmanuel Paul Rodocanachi (1789&#150;1855), merchant, and his wife, Franga (1795&#150;1880), daughter of Theodore Mavrogordato. He was a member of the Vlachou branch of one of the most influential families in the Greek merchant diaspora. Taken by his parents to Marseilles to avoid the turbulence which resulted in the 1822 Turkish massacre, Rodocanachi then moved to London in 1838. Here he combined a successful commercial career with a prominent role in the city's Greek community.<br>
<br>Michael Rodocanachi's emigration to London is believed to have been linked with his family's desire to extend its international trading network. Established in 1830 in Marseilles under the name Rodocanachi Sons, this network at its peak in the mid-1850s encompassed filial branches in Leghorn, London, Odessa, St Petersburg, and New York. The London operation under Michael Rodocanachi was given a fillip by the repeal of the corn laws, which offered great opportunities to merchants with links to such grain-exporting regions as the Black Sea littoral. Rodocanachi secured membership of the Baltic exchange, and also bought three ships to complement his grain-trading activities. He diversified his activities into property and finance. On 18 May 1853 Michael Rodocanachi married in Marseilles, Ariadne Michael (1827&#150;1859), the daughter of Michael Petrocochino, a Greek merchant trading out of that port. The newlyweds returned to London but the marriage was cut short by Ariadne's death, on 15 April 1859. Rodocanachi was left a widower with two sons and he never remarried.<br>
<br>In 1857, as a leading member of the exchange, Rodocanachi became a founding shareholder of the Baltic Company Ltd, which acquired the freehold of South Sea House, the exchange's premises. He set up a number of property companies, most notably the City Offices Company. His most important commercial venture was his participation with A. P. Petrocochino, D. S. Schilizzi, and others, in the establishment in 1862 in London of the Imperial Bank, which had a subscribed capital of &pound;2.25 million. In 1893 this business was acquired by the London Joint Stock Bank Ltd on very favourable terms. When the latter bank was taken over by the London City and Midland Bank (later the Midland Bank) in 1918, Rodocanachi's son Emmanuel Michael became a director of that bank for life.<br>
<br>Rodocanachi was an active member of the Greek Orthodox church in London, playing a leading role in fund-raising for the construction of St Sophia's, the Greek Orthodox cathedral in Bayswater, London. This replaced the church at London Wall in the City, whose location by the late 1870s had become inconvenient to a community now gravitating nearer to London's West End. Rodocanachi was a trustee of the building fund and in the early 1880s was one of St Sophia's three churchwardens. He was also responsible for setting up the cathedral's trust fund in 1888. In 1897 he moved to Worthing for health reasons, building an impressive residence at 19 Heene Road, which he named after the island of his birth, &#145;Chios&#146;. He died at his son's house, 58 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 3 April 1901, and was interred in the Greek Orthodox cemetery at West Norwood.<br>
<br>His elder son, <a name="cosubject_59879"></a><span class="headword">Emmanuel Michael Rodocanachi</span>  (1855&#150;1932), <span class="occ">banker and financier</span>, was born on 11 September 1855 at 3 Gloucester Square, London. Educated at Westminster School and at Trinity College, Oxford, he began his commercial career with Rodocanachi Sons &amp; Co., eventually succeeding his father as its head. He also took over as chairman of the other firms established by his father. To the directorship in the Midland Bank were added directorships of the Bank of Athens and the Royal Automobile Club Buildings Company. However, these trappings of commercial success were somewhat at variance with the lacklustre performance under his stewardship of the family's flagship company, Rodocanachi Sons &amp; Co. At the 1918 general election he unsuccessfully contested Horsham and Worthing, as an independent against the coalition government candidate. Keenly interested in economic matters he championed the need to curb government expenditure. He married in 1888 Alexandra J. Angelasto (1870&#150;1958) and they had a son and three daughters. He died at his home, 66 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 14 February 1932, and was buried in the Greek Orthodox cemetery at West Norwood on 17 February.<br>
