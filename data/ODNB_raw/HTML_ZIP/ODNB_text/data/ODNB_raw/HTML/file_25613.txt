<span class="headword">Sinclair,  George</span>, fourth earl of Caithness  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1527, <em>d.</em> 1582), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second born but eldest surviving son of John Sinclair, third earl of Caithness (<i>d</i>. 1529), and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Sutherland of Duffus. Born before 14 July 1527, his wardship was entrusted at first to Alexander Stewart, bishop of Moray, who died in 1537, and then to James Kirkcaldy of Grange and the courtier Oliver Sinclair. He first sat as a peer in parliament in 1542. In 1544, while the bishop of Caithness was in exile in England, the earl attempted to expand his influence by allying with Donald Mackay, a local chieftain, in order to appropriate some of the landed wealth of the diocese. Caithness took the bishop's castle of Strabister and Mackay took Skibo. When the bishop returned, Caithness and his confederates refused to restore his lands and rents. The earls of Huntly and Sutherland summoned them to appear at Helmsdale where both submitted, but Mackay was imprisoned for a time. On 2 October 1545 Caithness resigned his earldom into the hands of Queen Mary, who granted a charter to his son and heir, John Sinclair, under the usual reservation of a liferent of the earldom to himself. In September 1553 an act was passed resolving a dispute between Caithness and Mackay. Caithness continued to be a volatile influence in the north-east. In July 1555 he refused to convoke his men to appear at the justice ayres summoned by Mary of Guise, the queen regent, during her progress through the north. As a result he was imprisoned, first in Inverness and then in Edinburgh, being released only on payment of a large fine. On 18 December 1556 he was granted a remission for this and many other disorders.<br>
<br>It was later claimed that Caithness, along with other Catholic nobles, sponsored a mission by John Leslie, official of Aberdeen diocese and later bishop of Ross, to the newly widowed Mary, queen of Scots, in 1561 in the hope of persuading her to ally with the conservative faction among the lords, rather than with the earl of Moray and his protestant confederates. The mission was unsuccessful, but Caithness consistently supported the conservative and Catholic cause in the years following the establishment of the Reformation in 1560. His name is not recorded on the sederunt of the Reformation Parliament of August 1560, but Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador, wrote that only the earls of Caithness and Cassillis opposed the abolition of the mass and papal authority and the adoption of a reformed confession of faith at this parliament. Knox claimed that Caithness was present and dissented along with other lords, while Archbishop Hamilton stated that he was absent in order to avoid voting on the issue. Probably he was present but sometimes left the room. In 1563 Caithness was ordered into custody at Edinburgh for the murder of some servants of the Earl Marischal. In the dispute between the earl of Moray and Queen Mary in 1565 Caithness took the queen's side. In February 1566 he willingly accepted Mary's encouragement to attend mass, and he was present in Edinburgh on the night of the murder of her secretary, David Riccio (9 March), although he left the town along with the earl of Atholl and other conservative lords three days after the event. On 17 April he was created hereditary justiciar in Caithness; the appointment was confirmed on 14 February 1567.<br>
<br>Caithness hoped to use this position as a platform to carve out a greater area of secure and independent personal rule for himself in the far north which would render him less vulnerable to his Gordon rivals, the earls of Sutherland and Huntly. In the crises of the last years of Queen Mary's personal rule he remained an ally of the queen. After the murder of Darnley, Caithness acted as foreman of the jury at the sham trial which acquitted the earl of Bothwell of the crime. Caithness protested at the time that no crime should be imputed to the jurors since nobody had appeared to accuse Bothwell of the murder or brought any proof in support of the indictment. However, the members of the Lennox family, who would have pressed the charge, were all intimidated from attending by Bothwell's supporters. Although Caithness supported Bothwell's marriage to Queen Mary, after his &#145;abduction&#146; of the queen, he reluctantly joined the confederate lords in a rebellion intended to free her from Bothwell's control. After the confrontation at Carberry on 15 June 1567, which ended with Bothwell's flight and Mary's imprisonment in Lochleven, Caithness considered his position. Essentially an opportunist, described by a contemporary as &#145;making always fair weather with those in authority&#146;  (Hewitt, 24), he remained aloof from subsequent operations, failing to sign the bonds in support of the queen. He rejoined her before the battle of Langside on 13 May 1568 and after her flight to England remained a staunch member of her party in Scotland, even writing to Queen Elizabeth on Mary's behalf in July 1568. But as the tide turned against the Marian party the earl began to detach himself from his former loyalties, and in September 1571 he consented to the election of the earl of Mar as regent of the kingdom. After Mar's death he attached himself to the earl of Morton until the regent's fortunes began to wane in 1578.<br>
<br>In 1575 Caithness was granted a yearly pension by the bishop of Caithness for help given in the gathering and protection of episcopal revenues. In 1568 he secured the wardship of Alexander Gordon, twelfth earl of Sutherland, a rival to the Sinclairs in the region. Caithness forcibly married Alexander, aged fifteen, to his 32-year-old daughter Barbara, in order, it was alleged, to secure control over the Sutherland territories. His plan was thwarted by Alexander's escape from his father-in-law's custody and his subsequent divorce after a long struggle to regain his patrimony. Caithness was also accused of involvement in the poisoning in July 1567 of Alexander's father, Earl John, and his wife and of thereafter attempting to destroy the charters and deeds of the house of Sutherland during Alexander's wardship. His plans were frustrated since Earl John had transferred the charters and deeds to the custody of the laird of Carnegie. Caithness traced a violent course in his dealings with his own neighbours. In 1570 he launched an attack on the Murrays during which the cathedral at Dornoch was burnt. He imprisoned John, his own eldest son and heir, in the castle of Girnigoe for plotting against him. John remained in captivity for about seven years before dying, it was said, of starvation and neglect in 1575.<br>
<br>Caithness died at Edinburgh on 9 September 1582 and was buried in the Sinclair foundation at Roslin, outside the town. His heart was cased in lead and buried in the Sinclair aisle in the church at Wick. It is related that during a raid on the town by the earl of Sutherland in 1588, one of the earl's troops entered the church and found the casket. He opened it in the hope of finding valuables, but simply scattered the contents to the winds. The earl's impressive monument survives, however. Caithness was married to Elizabeth Graham, daughter of the second earl of Montrose. She was dead by 4 April 1576. They had four sons and five daughters: John, master of Caithness, who died in prison; William of Mey, who died without legitimate heirs; George of Mey; David; Barbara, or Beatrix, who married and was divorced from Alexander, earl of Sutherland; Elizabeth, who married first Alexander Sutherland of Duffus, and second Hugh Mackay of Farr; Margaret, married to William Sutherland of Duffus; Barbara, said to have been married to Alexander Innes of Innes; and Agnes who married, as his second wife, Andrew Hay, eighth earl of Erroll.<br>
