<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hastings,  Somerville</span>  (1878&#150;1967), <span class="occ">surgeon and politician</span>, was born on 4 March 1878 in Boreham Road, Warminster, Wiltshire, the son of Henry George Hastings (1850?&#150;1905), Congregationalist minister, and his wife, Ellen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ward). He was educated at Wycliffe College, and, on a medical scholarship, at University College and the Middlesex Hospital, London, during which he received a number of prizes, including medals in botany, an enduring interest. Hastings's academic and professional qualifications were MB, MRCS, and LRCP (1902); BS (1903); FRCS (1904); and MS (1908). Alongside his lucrative private practice, Hastings had a lifetime association with the Middlesex Hospital, specializing in ear, nose, and throat medicine. On 19 October 1911 he married Bessie Tuke (1881/2&#150;1958), daughter of William Tuke, architect; they had two children.<br>
<br>Hastings was active in labour and medical reform politics before 1914, and by the 1920s he had formulated what were to remain his core beliefs. Hastings's socialized health service was to have a full-time, salaried medical personnel, and hence no private practice; and an integrated hospital system. Free and comprehensive services were to be organized around health centres, with an accompanying shift from curative to preventive medicine. Control was to be by democratically elected local authorities, centrally co-ordinated by the Ministry of Health.<br>
<br>After the First World War Hastings emerged as an important figure on the medical left. He became a leading member of the Labour Party's public health advisory committee; and, in 1923&#150;4 and again in 1929&#150;31, the Labour member of parliament for Reading. In 1930 Hastings helped form the organization with which he is most closely associated, the Socialist Medical Association, which affiliated to the Labour Party in 1931. Hastings was its founding president and he retained the presidency until 1951. He expended considerable energy, particularly in the association's crucial pre-war and wartime period, on socialist medical politics. He was often the association's delegate to the Labour Party conference, and was instrumental in having the party commit itself by 1934 to a national health service. He wrote and lectured extensively on his vision of a socialized medical service, and travelled abroad to study foreign medical systems and meet other socialist doctors. Most significant of all was his election in 1932 to the London county council as member for Mile End. Hastings held this seat until 1946, during which time he served (in 1944&#150;5) as council chairman. Thereafter he was, from 1946 to 1964, an alderman, and he continued to serve on various committees. He was also a member of the London Labour Party's executive committee from 1934 to 1950. Membership of the London county council was Hastings's most successful and important venture into politics. After Labour took control in 1934 he was chairman of its hospital and medical services committee for ten years. As London was the largest provider of hospital beds in the country, this was a great responsibility. His council experience confirmed Hastings's view that medical services should be provided by democratic local bodies.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the influence of Hastings and the Socialist Medical Association increased. He was one of the three original association representatives on the British Medical Association's medical planning commission; and he was chairman of Labour's revived advisory committee on public health, a body charged with formulating proposals for a national health service. It seemed possible that Hastings's vision of a socialized medical service would be realized, given his own and his organization's heightened influence in labour and medical politics.<br>
<br>Hastings was elected member of parliament for Barking at the 1945 general election, a seat he held until his retirement in 1959. He claimed publicly that the post-war Labour government's National Health Service was in large part attributable to the work of the Socialist Medical Association. However, not all that Hastings desired was achieved. The minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, would have little to do with Hastings or the association. Bevan created a centrally controlled system and made concessions to the medical profession over issues such as private practice. Although a commitment was made to develop health centres, this did not happen. Hastings therefore welcomed and defended the National Health Service, but only as a first, imperfect, step towards a socialized medical service. He continued to agitate for his ideal of socialized medicine; to work as an active constituency member of parliament; and to serve on numerous boards and committees. He died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, on 7 July 1967.<br>
<br>Hastings deserves acknowledgement as a pioneer of socialized medicine. But while it is easy to obtain a picture of the public figure, it is harder to see beyond this to the private individual. Hastings was a lifelong Christian (this being central to his political beliefs) and a teetotaller, and seems to have led an unpretentious, possibly somewhat austere, life. Some contemporaries have described him as rather cold, even aloof, with colleagues and patients. He was, however, regarded by others with considerable respect. He was described, on occasions, as shy; but also as enthusiastic in his passions, generous to his friends, and without pomposity. Hastings typifies the professional, altruistic, middle-class Christian socialist of his time.<br>
