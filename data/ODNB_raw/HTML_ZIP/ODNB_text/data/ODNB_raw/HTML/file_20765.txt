<span class="headword">O'Neill,  Brian  mac Phelim</span>, lord of Clandeboye  (<em>d.</em> 1574), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was the son of Phelim O'Neill (Feidhlimidh Bacach &Oacute; N&eacute;ill), lord of Clandeboye between 1529 and his death in 1533. Clandeboye was an extensive lordship in south Antrim and north Down. The O'Neills of Clann Aodh Buidhe had come to dominate the region following the disintegration of the earldom of Ulster from the mid-thirteenth century. By the early sixteenth century the English presence in the earldom had been reduced to a small pocket around Carrickfergus, and enclaves in Lecale and southern Ards. However, Brian's grandfather Hugh or Aodh (<i>d</i>. 1524) was the last great lord of Clandeboye. Following Hugh's death the lordship was undermined by the succession of a series of short-lived lords, including Brian's father. Internecine struggles for power left Clandeboye effectively divided by 1555 between Phelim's sons Brian and Hugh and their cousin Conn.<br>
<br>Brian and his brother travelled to Dublin in May 1556 and promised to serve the English crown &#145;like as by report they have done a long time since&#146;  (<span class="italic">Haliday MSS</span>, 2). The English administration in Dublin decided to formalize the division of Clandeboye as a means of making it more amenable to English influence. However, Brian mac Phelim won to his side William Piers, captain of Carrickfergus Castle, and, to his great benefit, his brother Hugh and cousin Conn were detained in the castle while Brian ruled as lord of all Clandeboye. Brian mac Phelim married twice: first, a daughter of Art Magennis, Viscount Iveagh, who died before 1568; and second Anne, daughter of Brian Carragh MacDonnell, captain of Glenconkoyne, who died with her husband.<br>
<br>In 1565 Piers composed his &#145;Opinion&#146;, advocating the colonization of Ulster east of the River Bann, including Clandeboye. Subsequently, however, he formed a close relationship with Brian mac Phelim O'Neill, based primarily on their common interest in containing the expansion of Scottish power in north Antrim and the ambitions of the O'Neills of Tyrone east of the Bann. O'Neill allowed Piers to exact a levy on part of Clandeboye to supplement the meagre resources allocated to the Carrickfergus garrison by the English crown. In 1570 O'Neill undertook responsibility for victualling the garrison. For his part, Piers helped to bolster O'Neill's authority throughout Clandeboye. He regularly reported Brian's good service and he promoted his suit to have his lordship of Clandeboye formally recognized by Elizabeth, holder of the title to the defunct earldom of Ulster. Brian mac Phelim received a letter of thanks in July 1567 and was subsequently knighted in recognition of his services against the rebellious Se&aacute;n O'Neill, but the queen would not legitimize his lordship because of plans to colonize eastern Ulster to England's benefit.<br>
<br>On 16 November 1571 Sir Thomas Smith, the English privy councillor, received a royal grant of an extensive portion of Clandeboye in Ards and lands adjoining it south of Belfast. Forewarned, perhaps by Piers, O'Neill protested his loyalty and service to the English crown. When the planters arrived on 30 August 1572 he drove them off. They subsequently returned to establish a foothold at Newtownards but their leader, Thomas Smith junior, was killed by some Irishmen who boiled his body and fed it to their dogs. Despite two attempts by Sir Thomas Smith to reinforce the colony it fizzled out.<br>
<br>In August 1573 Walter Devereux, earl of Essex, landed at Carrickfergus. He had received a royal grant of all of the recently created county of Antrim, excepting only Carrickfergus and its immediate environs, with no regard for the rights of Irish landowners like O'Neill of Clandeboye. O'Neill formed an alliance with Turlough Luineach O'Neill, lord of Tyrone, and, together with the Scots in Antrim, succeeded in thwarting Essex's grandiose plantation plans. Essex had mortgaged much of his estate to finance this venture and, as his wealth was dissipated to no effect, he became increasingly frustrated and vicious. He arrested William Piers and sought his execution for allegedly passing on intelligence to Brian O'Neill for use against him. Essex bitterly resented O'Neill for outwitting him, and for dashing his dreams of winning fame and fortune in Ulster. By 13 May 1574 Essex had the Irish lord proclaimed a traitor and put a bounty of &pound;200 on his head.<br>
<br>O'Neill secured a pardon from the crown on 17 June and left his sons in Dublin as pledges for his good faith. He also agreed to assist Essex in fortifying Belfast. He seems to have been assured, wrongly, that it was possible to effect a reconciliation with Essex. Early in November 1574 O'Neill, accompanied by his wife, his brother Rory Oge, and an entourage of about 200 persons, attended a parley with Essex in Belfast. However, after a banquet, English soldiers massacred O'Neill's entourage. O'Neill, his wife, and brother were taken to Dublin. Between 14 and 24 November they were tried for treason, executed, and quartered, notwithstanding the royal pardon and Essex's own guarantees.<br>
<br>Essex died in 1576 and Brian's son Se&aacute;n eventually established a title to Belfast Castle and three-quarters of north Clandeboye, while his uncle Hugh's son Niall held the remaining quarter. Brian mac Phelim's cousin Conn, after many years of detention in Carrickfergus Castle, was established at Castlereagh as chief captain in south Clandeboye. The judicial murder of Brian mac Phelim O'Neill, together with his wife and brother, and the slaughter of his entourage, was long remembered as one of the worst acts of English infamy perpetrated in Ireland. Its significance was magnified by the fact that O'Neill was one of those Irish lords who sought an accommodation with the English crown. His demise suggested that the Irish nobility, however accommodating, were expendable should they dare to resist English ambitions.<br>
