<span class="headword">Wauchope, Sir  John, of Niddrie</span>  (1592/3&#150;1682), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son and heir of Sir Francis Wauchope of Niddrie (<i>d</i>. in or before 1632) and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir James Sandilands of Slamannan. Wauchope was said to have been fourteen in July 1607  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1st ser., 14.50). The Wauchope family originated in the borders and had settled at Niddrie Marischal in Edinburghshire by 1404, when Gilbert Wauchope was granted a charter. The estate was forfeited in 1592 after Archibald Wauchope joined Bothwell's rebellion. In 1609 the royal favourite Sir James Sandilands effected its transfer to Sir Francis Wauchope, who was both Archibald's son and his own son-in-law. The debts incurred in the transaction were such that Sir Francis was obliged to leave his family and join the Scots brigade in the Netherlands.<br>
<br>John Wauchope, &#145;by his frugal way of living, pay'd the 200,000 merks of cautionry&#146;  (Paterson, 29) which had been the price of regaining the family estate, and rebuilt Niddrie House. He succeeded to the family estate at Niddrie in 1632, in August of which year he married Anna, daughter of Sir Andrew Hamilton of Redhouse. They had two sons and two daughters who reached adulthood.<br>
<br>Wauchope was knighted by Charles I on his visit to Edinburgh in 1633. He was a commissioner to parliament in 1639&#150;41 and in 1643 sat on the committee of war. He was appointed a colonel in June 1644 and in July a commissioner to enforce the provisions of the <span class="roman">Coal Act</span>. In furtherance of these appointments he raised a regiment and served under Lord Leven in the siege and storming of Newcastle on 19 October 1644. Within a month he was back in Edinburghshire where he became involved in a dispute over possession of a coal pit from which he was accused of chasing his rival &#145;with a drawin sword and had killed him therewith if he had not hardlie escaped&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 2nd ser., 8.38). The privy council found the accusation of riot not proven by seven votes to three.<br>
<br>Wauchope was a commissioner to parliament and sheriff of Edinburghshire in 1649 and in that year again raised a regiment for service against the English. He advanced money for Charles II's expedition to Scotland and, when Cromwell marched to Scotland in 1650, the English army garrisoned Niddrie from where they stripped the copper from the roof. He sat in Charles II's parliaments at Perth and Stirling between June 1651 and June 1652. He was expelled from his lands by the English and obliged to accept for Edinburghshire the English parliament's &#145;Tender of Union&#146; at Dalkeith.<br>
<br>Wauchope's first wife having died, on 16 June 1652 he married Jean (<i>d</i>. in or after 1692), widow of Sir John Ker of Lochtour and daughter of Sir Thomas Ker of Redden, with whom he had one son. He was fined &pound;2000 under the <span class="roman">Act of Pardon and Grace</span> published by General Monck in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654, but the fine was remitted in 1655 after he acted as a commissioner for the cess.<br>
<br>Wauchope was in London for the coronation of Charles II and in July 1661, at the age of sixty-eight, he joined the privy council of Scotland on which he sat for the following twenty years. He lived to be one of the longest serving members of Charles's government in Scotland, attending meetings into his eighty-ninth year when he was barely able to scratch his signature on the orders in council. He last sat on 20 September 1681, and died at Niddrie the following January. He was buried in Niddrie Chapel. He was succeeded by his son Andrew Wauchope (1633&#150;1711), who converted to Catholicism and sat on the privy council of James VII and II, in consequence of which the chapel at Niddrie was burnt by the Edinburgh mob in 1688. Sir John's second son, John Wauchope, Lord Edmonstone (1633&#150;1709), sat as a lord of session until he was deprived by William III for not taking the test in 1689.<br>
