<span class="headword">Debrett,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1822), <span class="occ">publisher and bookseller</span>, took over John Almon's business at 178 Piccadilly, London, in 1781. Debrett inherited some of Almon's whig patronage, and his shop was reputed to be &#145;much frequented about the middle of the day by fashionable people, and &hellip; used as a lounging place for political and literary conversation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Picture of London</span>, 27), especially by those with whiggish sympathies, while those who supported Pitt would visit the neighbouring shop belonging to John Stockdale. Debrett published many works, among them a new edition of <span class="italic">The Foundling Hospital for Wit</span> (1784), <span class="italic">Asylum for Fugitive Pieces in Prose and Verse</span> (1785&#150;8), the <span class="italic">European Magazine</span> (1782&#150;1801), and <span class="italic">The British Imperial Calendar</span> (1818, 1820&#150;22). During the 1780s he also published a series of pamphlets by John Almon in support of the parliamentary whigs, and in 1797 he published the parliamentary papers. But Debrett is best known for his works on the peerage. The first edition of Debrett's <span class="italic">Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland</span> appeared in 1803. Debrett edited the next fifteen editions (the fifteenth appearing in 1823, after his death). Debrett's <span class="italic">Baronetage of England</span> began in 1808. Both works, usually published in one volume, still flourish, and Debrett's name is used in a wide variety of reference books.<br>
<br>Despite his fame, Debrett was twice declared bankrupt (in 1801 and 1804). His obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> described him as &#145;a kind, good-natured, friendly, man, who experienced the vicissitudes of life with fortitude. He had full opportunity of acquiring a large fortune, but from too much confidence and easiness of temper, he did not turn it to the best account&#146;. Debrett appears to have given up his shop in 1805, but did not retire from publishing until about 1814. He then lived partly on an annuity from his wife, Sophia, which supplemented the money he earned from the <span class="italic">Peerage</span> and the <span class="italic">Baronetage</span>. He died at his lodgings in Upper Gloucester Street, Regent's Park, London, on 15 November 1822, having been ill for some time. He was survived by his wife and four children: John Edward Debrett; Sophia Mirabella, wife of Richard Samuel Butler Sandilands; Maria Amy Debrett; and Henry Symons Debrett.<br>
