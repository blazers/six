<span class="headword">Chisholm,  Archibald Macra</span>  (1824&#150;1897), <span class="occ">army officer and shinty player</span>, was born on 5 July 1824 at Taewig on the banks of the River Glass, in Strathglass, in the parish of Kilmorack, Inverness-shire, the eldest son of Dr Stewart Chisholm (<i>d</i>. 1862), deputy inspector-general of army hospitals, and his wife, Mary Macra of Ardintoul, Kintail, sister of Sir John Macra, colonel of the Cameron Highlanders. His parents were Roman Catholics, and he was educated at the Coll&egrave;ge St Sulpice, Montreal. In 1841 he was ensigned into &#145;Scotia's darling corps&#146;&#151;the Royal Highlanders, the famous Black Watch&#151;and standing 6 feet 2 inches he was the tallest officer in the regiment, as well as the only Roman Catholic among the officers. His first posting was to Malta and he was made a lieutenant by the age of twenty-one. During army leave he travelled widely to Greece and Sicily and later saw service in Bermuda (1848) and Nova Scotia. Indeed, Chisholm claimed that he had played shinty there &#145;with our cousins and relations in Canada, during the winter, on skates, with a splendid field of ice, 300 miles long, 200 miles wide, and the ice at least 10 feet thick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Inverness Courier</span>, 19 Feb 1880).<br>
<br>The Black Watch regiment returned home from overseas in 1852. A year later, on 14 October 1853, in St Andrew's Catholic Cathedral, Glasgow, Captain Chisholm married Maria Frances (<i>b</i>. 1830), only daughter of William Dominic Lynch and his wife, Margaret Farquharson. On war being declared in 1854, he went with the Black Watch to the Crimea. He returned home on promotion in 1855, and retired from the service, then acted for a time as factor for the duchess of Leeds at Applecross. Captain Chisholm and his wife first rented Balblair House in Kirkhill parish, Inverness-shire, but after a few years they moved to Glassburn House (Allt na Glaislig), Cannich, Inverness-shire where they &#145;passed a quiet Highland life, interested themselves in all their dependents, and in the farmers and people generally throughout the Strath&#146;  (Stirton, 19). A white cross was painted on the hillside opposite Glassburn House, so that Captain Chisholm, a devout Catholic, could see it when he woke up. Accompanied by his wife he also led a party of volunteers to Rome in 1868 to protect the pope against the threatened attack of Garibaldi.<br>
<br>Chisholm excelled in all sports, and loved all aspects of the Gaelic language&#151;its song and music, sports, and pastimes. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the game of shinty, and its development in the highlands owed much to his encouragement. In 1879 the famous Strathglass shinty club was formed, with Glassburn, as Chisholm became known, as chief. Chisholm published the first formed set of written rules, regulations, and diagrams for the sport in 1880, and issued a revised edition in 1888. He was elected the first chief of the ruling body of shinty, the Camanachd Association, which was constituted in October 1893; he held the position for four years. He also acted as club-bearer for the Highland Camanachd Club of London. Chisholm was of splendid appearance, a courteous gentleman of humour and great integrity, and he was considered to be the best amateur piper of his time. He was an active and influential member of the Gaelic Society of Inverness: he was involved in its earliest years and played at its annual assembly on several occasions. For thirty years he also judged piping at the Northern Meetings (established 1788). Chisholm died on 19 October 1897 at home at Glassburn House, having suffered a lengthy illness, and was buried four days later in the New Catholic cemetery near the Old Priory of Beauly, Inverness-shire. He was survived by his wife. Chisholm was the subject of a number of poems in Gaelic and English.<br>
