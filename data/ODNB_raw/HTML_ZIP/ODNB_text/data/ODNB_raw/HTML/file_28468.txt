<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  Andrew Barclay</span>, first baronet  (1824&#150;1893), <span class="occ">brewer and benefactor</span>, was born at Auchinflower, Ayrshire, on 15 December 1824, the second son of Peter Walker (1795&#150;1879) of the Fort brewery, Ayr, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1846), eldest daughter of Arthur Carlaw of Ayr. He was educated at Ayr Academy and at the Liverpool Institute. On completion of his education Walker was taken into partnership in the brewing business by his father, who had established a small brewery in Ray Street, near St Paul's Square in Liverpool. The business expanded rapidly and in 1846 a new brewery was opened in Warrington, where the family already had two breweries. In 1877 another brewery was opened in Burton upon Trent to specialize in the brewing of high-quality bitter ales under the title of A. B. Walker &amp; Sons. On the death of his father in 1879 Walker became sole proprietor of the Warrington breweries and in 1890 the firm converted to a limited liability company, &#145;Peter Walker &amp; Son Warrington &amp; Burton Ltd&#146;, with Walker as the first chairman. Walker also acquired a number of colliery properties in Ayrshire and south Wales from which he derived a large income.<br>
<br>Walker entered the Liverpool city council in 1867. He was elected alderman in 1871, served the office of mayor in 1873&#150;4 and 1876&#150;7, and was high sheriff of Lancashire in 1886. At a cost in excess of &pound;50,000 he built the Walker Art Gallery which was opened and presented to the town in September 1877. In 1886 he provided &pound;20,000 for the building of engineering laboratories in connection with the Liverpool University College which was opened in 1889. He also contributed other large sums to charity and art and literature in Liverpool throughout his life. To the village of Gateacre, near Liverpool, he gave a village green and an institute, library, and reading-room. In recognition of his public services he was knighted on 12 December 1877, and created baronet on 12 February 1886. In 1884, for approximately &pound;250,000, he purchased Osmaston Manor in Derbyshire, with furniture, model village, and estate. As a mariner he owned a famous steam yacht called the <i>Cuhona</i> on which he entertained several members of the royal family, including the prince of Wales.<br>
<br>In November 1889 Walker resigned from his position as alderman on the city council because of ill health. In recognition of his service to the city, Liverpool made him its first honorary freeman in January 1890, and in December the same year he was presented with his portrait by W. Q. Orchardson RA.<br>
<br>Walker was twice married. His first wife, whom he married in 1853, was Eliza, daughter of John Reid of Limekilns, Fife; they had six sons and two daughters. She died on 20 March 1882, and on 11 October 1887 he married the Hon. Maude (<i>b</i>. 1861/2), second daughter of Haughton Charles Okeover of Okeover Hall, Staffordshire, whose title derived from her having been a maid of honour to Queen Victoria. Walker died at his residence, Gateacre Grange, Little Woolton, Lancashire, on 27 February 1893, leaving personalty valued at &pound;2,876,781 18<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>., besides much freehold property. He was survived by his second wife and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Peter Carlaw Walker (1854&#150;1915), who also took over control of the family firm and lived at Osmaston.<br>
