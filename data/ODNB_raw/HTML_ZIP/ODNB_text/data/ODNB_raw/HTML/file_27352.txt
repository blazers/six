<span class="headword">Thornton,  Bonnell</span>  (1725&#150;1768), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in February 1725, probably in Maiden Lane, Westminster, but not baptized until 28 September, the son of Rebecca and John Thornton. His father was a successful apothecary who later styled himself &#145;Gent.&#146; and moved to the somewhat grander Chandos Street. In 1736 Thornton was admitted to Westminster School; he became a king's scholar in 1739. Here he met Charles Churchill and William Cowper; his later friends Robert Lloyd and George Colman the elder were also at Westminster. He was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, and matriculated there on 1 June 1743. He took his BA in 1747, his MA in 1750, and the MB in 1754. His father wished him to practise as a doctor. Thornton had however already commenced a literary career while at Oxford. He produced an <span class="italic">Ode on Saint Caecilia's Day, Adapted to the Ancient British Musick</span> (1749), a parody of the odes produced each 22 November, comically designed for hurdy-gurdy, Jew's harp, saltbox, and marrow bone and cleaver. He assisted Christopher Smart on <span class="italic">The Midwife, or, The Old Woman's Magazine</span> (October 1750) and <span class="italic">The Student, or, Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany</span> (1750&#150;51).<br>
<br>In 1751 Thornton was one of the early governors of St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics. In 1752 he was hired to write a paper countering Fielding's the <span class="italic">Covent Garden Journal</span>. Thornton's <span class="italic">Have At You All, or, The Drury-Lane Journal</span> ran for twelve numbers from 16 January to 9 April 1752 and consisted of a close parody of Fielding's style, though it included other targets such as Johnson's <span class="italic">Rambler</span>. On 16 November 1752 he began the <span class="italic">Spring-Garden Journal</span>, another Fielding parody, which ran for four issues. On 14 November he began contributing to John Hawkesworth's <span class="italic">Adventurer</span>, an association which lasted until 3 April 1753; he appears to have written those papers marked &#145;A&#146;.<br>
<br>On Thursday 31 January 1754 Thornton and Colman began <span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span>. It ran for 140 numbers to 30 September 1756, and was jointly written, though there were contributions from Cowper and Lloyd. Colman's son (not a disinterested witness) suggests that Thornton was lazy, or drunk, and occasionally left the efficient Colman to repair his omissions. Johnson thought the periodical's essays on contemporary life &#145;wanted matter&#146;, but Boswell defended its &#145;just views of the surface of life, and &hellip; very sprightly manner&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.420) and the periodical was much reprinted. In 1755 Thornton and Colman produced the two-volume <span class="italic">Poems by Eminent Ladies</span>, a broad-minded anthology of poetry by women from the Restoration onwards, with biographical notes. About this time the [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71305', "Nonsense Club")</script>] began to meet every Thursday to plan burlesques and practical jokes; the main members were Thornton, Colman, Lloyd and Cowper.<br>
<br>Thornton wrote <span class="italic">Idler</span> no. 15 (22 July 1758), a Hogarthian exploration of henpecked tradesmen. In 1760 he published <span class="italic">City Latin</span>, demolishing with assurance John Patterson's published Latin inscriptions for the new bridge at Blackfriars. He and Colman became closely associated with Garrick, whose side they took during the theatre controversies of the period. Robert Lloyd's <span class="italic">The Actor: a Poetical Epistle to Bonnell Thornton</span> (1760) includes much praise of Garrick's style. On 14 March 1761 Thornton, with Colman, Garrick, and other investors, founded the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, a thrice-weekly literary newspaper born from the theatre war and partly designed to manipulate public opinion. Thornton was a substantial contributor and adviser. The paper was successful and prestigious, but a <span class="italic">Yearly Chronicle</span> of pieces from the paper lost money and was discontinued.<br>
<br>On 22 April 1762 a &#145;Grand exhibition of the Society of Sign-Painters&#146; opened at Thornton's rooms in Bow Street. The project of mocking the exhibitions of the Society of Arts and its rival the Society of Artists with a collection of &#145;street art&#146; appears to have been his, though Hogarth retouched some of the signs, which were extracted from various sites in town and country. The exhibition, which ran until 8 June (thus matching the &#145;serious&#146; exhibitions), was much described and catalogued, especially in the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>. The joke was reviewed warmly as a sample of Thornton's humour in the <span class="italic">London Register</span> (April 1762, 345&#150;52).<br>
<br>On 24 May 1763 Boswell called on Thornton and found him &#145;a well-bred, agreable man, lively and odd&#146;. He ascertained that Thornton's father had left him about &pound;15,000. Wilkes, Churchill, and Lloyd arrived and Boswell found himself &#145;just got into the middle of the London Geniuses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's London Journal</span>, 286). Thornton's rooms were a sort of political office during the Wilkes crisis. Thornton tried to help Wilkes through his influence in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, the other paper with which he was closely associated, and offered to indemnify its printer, Henry Sampson Woodfall, against legal expenses. He was kept under surveillance for his association with Wilkes and Churchill, with whom he travelled in the summer of 1763. He revived his burlesque St Cecilia <span class="italic">Ode</span>, using letters, essays, and accounts of rehearsals in the newspapers to publicize it. Wilkes was at the performance at Ranelagh House (10 June 1763), giving a political edge to the robust &#145;Englishness&#146; of the ode. The music was apparently by Thomas Arne, though Charles Burney also claimed to have produced a setting. Johnson &#145;praised its humour and seemed much diverted with it&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.420).<br>
<br>On 3 February 1764 Thornton married Sylvia, the daughter of Colonel John Braithwaite, governor of Cape Coast Castle in Africa. This seems to have cut his political links.<br>
<br>Lloyd, arrested for debt and thrown into the Fleet, was furious that Thornton failed to bail him out (he died in gaol on 15 December 1764). Wilkes found parts of a satire on Thornton among Churchill's papers but suppressed it at Colman's request. Thornton's son Bonnell George was born on 6 January 1765 (Christopher Smart dedicated his <span class="italic">The Parables of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</span> to the child in 1768); his daughter Sylvia was born in July 1766 and another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27361/', "Robert John Thornton")</script>, was born in 1768 after his father's death.<br>
<br>Thornton had announced his intention to translate Plautus into English verse as early as December 1762, publishing specimens in Lloyd's <span class="italic">St James's Magazine</span>. Colman's successful completion of a similar translation of Terence in 1765 finally spurred him to publish and in 1767 two volumes, containing seven plays, were published. Colman, to whom the translation was affectionately dedicated, contributed the translation of <span class="italic">Mercator</span> while Richard Warner translated <span class="italic">Captivi</span> and supplied some of the critical matter. After Thornton's death Warner completed the project in three further volumes (1772 and 1774), using Thornton's partial translations of two further plays. The translation was highly regarded for its purity and elegance, and its ability to replicate the wit of the original.<br>
<br>Thornton's last publication, <span class="italic">The Battle of the Wigs</span>, a Scriblerian satire on a subject similar to that of Samuel Garth's <span class="italic">Dispensary</span>, appeared early in 1768. Colman's son records that as he lay on his deathbed (at his home in Orchard Street, Westminster) Thornton was still full of mischief  (G. Colman, <span class="italic">Random Records</span>, 1830, 1.142&#150;3). He died on 9 May 1768. The <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span> (7&#150;10 May 1768) published a warm tribute to his sensibility and benevolence. He was buried on 15 May at St Margaret's, Westminster; a monument in the east cloister of Westminster Abbey includes a Latin epitaph by Joseph Warton celebrating his sincerity and liveliness as a writer and as a companion.<br>
<br>Thornton made no formal will. On 9 February 1764 he had written two memoranda leaving all his goods to his wife. Small bequests for mourning were made to Colman, Lloyd, and Cowper, alongside bequests to his wife's family and his servants. He asked for such papers as were not business documents to be burnt. The court granted probate to the widow and the Revd Thomas Winstanley  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/940, sig. 260, 1768). A picture of Thornton in the British Museum shows him wearing his own hair, a peculiarity for which he was noted.<br>
