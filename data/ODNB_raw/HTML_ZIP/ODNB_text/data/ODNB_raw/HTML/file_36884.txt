</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whymper,  Edward</span>  (1840&#150;1911), <span class="occ">mountaineer and wood-engraver</span>, was born on 27 April 1840 at Lambeth Terrace, Kennington Road, London, the second of the eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36885/', "Josiah Wood Whymper (1813&#150;1903)")</script>, wood-engraver, and his first wife, Elizabeth Whitworth Claridge (1819&#150;1859). He was educated at Clarendon House School until the age of fourteen, when he was apprenticed as a draughtsman engraver in his father's firm. His diary from 1855 to 1859 records his avid interest in public affairs and his frequent attendance at Baptist chapel and cricket matches at the Oval. After an early desire to go to sea or become an engineer Whymper developed an intense but unfocused ambition: &#145;I had ideas floating in my head that I should one day turn out some great person, be <i>the</i> great person of <i>my</i> day, perhaps Prime Minister, or at least a millionaire&#146;  (Smythe, 50). In 1859 the family moved to Town House, Haslemere, Surrey.<br>
<br>In 1860 the publisher William Longman commissioned Whymper to make illustrations of the Alps, for which he visited Saas Fee, Zermatt, Chamonix, and the Dauphin&eacute;. Whymper later claimed that he had first gone to the Alps &#145;to acquire such a knowledge of snow and ice as might perhaps procure me a post upon some future English Arctic Expedition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>, 6, 1873, 161). In 1861 he climbed Mont Pelvoux and was elected to the Alpine Club. Over the following summers he made a series of brilliant climbs and many first ascents, including the Barre des &Eacute;crins in the Dauphin&eacute;, the Aiguille Verte, and the Matterhorn.<br>
<br>Whymper centred his climbing ambitions on the Matterhorn, and from 1861 to 1865 he made seven attempts from the Italian side, sometimes in partnership with his rivals John Tyndall and Jean-Antoine Carrel, a guide from Val Tournanche. On 14 July 1865 he climbed the Matterhorn from Zermatt with Lord Francis Douglas, brother and heir presumptive to the marquess of Queensberry, Charles Hudson, vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, Douglas Hadow, a former student of Hudson's, Michel Croz, a Chamonix guide, and two Zermatt guides named Peter Taugwalder, a father and son. On the descent Hadow, an inexperienced climber, slipped and fell, knocking over Croz and dragging Hudson and Douglas off their feet. Whymper and the Taugwalders braced themselves and the rope tying them to the others broke, plunging the other four climbers 4000 feet to the glacier below. An inquest determined that the rope that broke was a spare piece of inferior quality, which had been improperly used.<br>
<br>Although Whymper was the subject of much personal criticism, his account of the accident helped to quell an acrimonious debate about mountaineering in 1865 and became the dramatic climax of his <span class="italic">Scrambles amongst the Alps in the Years 1860&#150;69</span> (1871), one of the most popular mountaineering books ever written. &#145;The book is entirely personal, all ego&#146;, Whymper told a friend in 1869. &#145;It will have a hundred illustrations&#151;the best your humble servant knows how to produce, and they will contain enough sensations for half a dozen volumes&#146;  (Smythe, 225). The book is written with simplicity, directness, and verve, and is profusely illustrated with his woodcuts.<br>
<br>Whymper opened an office for his engraving business on the Strand, London, in 1865 and contributed illustrations to numerous books of travel, such as Samuel Manning's <span class="italic">Swiss Pictures Drawn with Pen and Pencil</span> (1866), and to journals, such as the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Leisure Hour</span>, and the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. He also drew many portraits, examples of which appeared in <span class="italic">British Heroes and Worthies</span> (1871). With his father he contributed many engravings to Joseph Wolf's <span class="italic">Wild Animals</span> (1873&#150;4). He eventually took over his father's business, which maintained offices in both Lambeth Road and Ludgate Hill in the 1890s. In the face of competition from cheap photographic reproductions, however, the business closed in 1900.<br>
<br>Whymper occasionally interrupted his work as an engraver to continue his interests in Arctic and mountain exploration. In 1867 and 1872 he explored the interior of Greenland and returned with large collections of fossils and botanical specimens. From 1872 to 1874 he served as vice-president of the Alpine Club, and also in 1872 the king of Italy conferred on him the order of St Maurice and St Lazarus. Prevented by political difficulties from climbing in the Himalayas, however, he travelled in 1879&#150;80 to Ecuador with his former Matterhorn rival J. A. Carrel and the latter's cousin Louis Carrel, to test the physiological effects of low pressure at high altitudes and the phenomenon of &#145;mountain sickness&#146;. They twice climbed Chimborazo (20,498 feet), the highest mountain in Ecuador, and other peaks including Cotopaxi (19,613 feet), an active volcano. Whymper also surveyed the area and collected over 8000 zoological and botanical specimens. Often considered his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">Travels among the Great Andes of the Equator</span> (1891&#150;2) combines a popular account of his ascents with his detailed scientific observations. He also published a pamphlet: <span class="italic">How to Use an Aneroid Barometer</span> (1891). In 1892 Whymper received the patron's medal of the Royal Geographical Society. He also designed a new tent for his Ecuador journey that was widely used by mountaineers for many years.<br>
<br>Whymper returned frequently to the Alps and spent several years in painstaking and thorough research for his guidebooks on Chamonix (1896) and Zermatt (1897), both of which enjoyed considerable commercial success as a result of his skill as a writer and salesman: he travelled literally from hotel to hotel and from bookshop to bookshop through the Alps selling advertising and collecting royalties for the books. From 1896 to 1901 he spent his summers revising his books and his winters lecturing on the Alps and the Andes.<br>
<br>In 1900 Whymper made a lecture tour of the United States and Canada, and from 1901 to 1909 he returned to the Canadian Rockies periodically to promote tourism on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Railway. With his guides he made ascents and identified walking trails near the route of the railway in the Rockies. In 1905, however, he was injured in a train crash in Canada after which he began to experience memory loss, failing eyesight, and fainting spells. Whymper dropped his aitches throughout his life, but only appears to have been worried about this habit between 1905 and 1908, when he asked a nephew to correct it during his lectures.<br>
<br>Whymper was involved in a brief love affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33675/', "Charlotte Hanbury")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33676/', "Hanbury, Elizabeth")</script>] that ended with her death in 1900. On 25 April 1906 he married Edith Mary Lewin, forty-five years his junior, the daughter of W. Lewin of Forest Gate, London. They had one daughter, Ethel, before they were divorced in December 1910.<br>
<br>Although Whymper achieved his early ambition in the ascent of the Matterhorn, the bitter-sweet triumph and personal obloquy he endured after the accident permanently embittered him. An 1865 photograph shows the intense gaze of the powerful and confident climber with arms akimbo in a relaxed and resolute pose. An oil portrait by Lance Calkin, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1894, again depicts Whymper in his climbing gear, but his crossed arms, receding hairline, furrowed brow, downturned lips, granite jaw, and steely eyes darkened by circles from years of insomnia all suggest the forbidding, taciturn, and often morose demeanour for which he was known in his later years.<br>
<br>While on a visit to the Alps Whymper died at Chamonix on 16 September 1911; he was buried in the churchyard of the English church in Chamonix four days later. In 1925 a bronze plaque with a likeness of Whymper was unveiled on the fa&ccedil;ade of the Monte Rosa Hotel in Zermatt.<br>
