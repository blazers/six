<span class="headword">Montgomery,  George</span>  (1569/70&#150;1621), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Meath and Clogher</span>, was the second son of Adam Montgomery, laird of Braidstane, Ayrshire, while his mother was a daughter (whose name is unrecorded) of John Montgomery, laird of Hazlehead. He was born in 1569 or 1570, if one may judge from an inscription on his tomb, which stated that he died at fifty-one years of age in early 1621. His brother Hugh became the laird of Braidstane and first Viscount Montgomery of the Great Ardes, in Ulster. On the eve of the accession of James VI of Scotland to the English throne George Montgomery was the rector of Chedzoy, Somerset. He had married his first wife, Susan Steynings (<i>d</i>. 1614), a member of a local gentry family, in 1597. They were to be survived by a daughter called Jane.<br>
<br>James I had not been in London long when he appointed Montgomery as one of his chaplains. It has been suggested that this promotion was a reward for his communicating news from the English royal court to his brother Adam in the Scottish royal court in Elizabeth's final days. The king also promoted him to the deanery of Norwich, in which he was installed on 7 June 1603 and which he held until his resignation therefrom on 20 September 1614. Montgomery &#145;resided much at court&#146; in the first years of James's reign in England  (<span class="italic">Montgomery Manuscripts</span>, 20). According to later testimony from his daughter, the Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh and some other of his colleagues in Ireland employed Montgomery as their agent at court. It seems to have been at their suggestion that James I appointed him bishop of the Ulster dioceses of Derry, Raphoe, and Clogher on 15 February 1605.<br>
<br>Montgomery was sent to Ireland to survey the condition of the Catholic church in his three dioceses and to make recommendations to the king as to how it might be transformed into a protestant establishment. His work was thorough and systematic. It formed the basis for the creation of the new Church of Ireland in western and central Ulster. Montgomery was zealous in his efforts to recover the church's ancient patrimony from the local Irish nobility and English servitors alike. He had already succeeded in forcing Sir Cahir O'Doherty to recognize his title to certain church lands in Inishowen, co. Donegal, before O'Doherty rebelled in April 1608 and sacked the colonial settlement at Derry. Montgomery's house was looted and his library was destroyed by the rebels. His wife was detained as a hostage for three months by the Irish before being released. O'Doherty's failed rebellion, following the flight of the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell to mainland Europe, prompted James I to embark on the plantation of Ulster.<br>
<br>Montgomery was given a commission to assist in the survey and demarcation of the plantation estates. This put him in a strong position to represent the church's interests in the plantation project. Crucially, he managed to secure the <i>erenagh</i> lands, episcopal lands held by paraclerical tenants, for the Church of Ireland bishops despite attempts to classify them as &#145;monastic&#146; lands forfeited to the crown. By the summer of 1610 the plans for the Ulster plantation were almost finalized. However, Montgomery's insistence on recovering the island of Derry for the church brought him into conflict with the crown, which intended to make Derry the chief British stronghold in Ulster. James I obliged the bishop to resign from Derry and Raphoe, after making a composition with the crown whereby he ceded the church's title to the island of Derry in return for a royal charter confirming his title to the remainder of the church's patrimony in Derry diocese. As a reward for his instrumental role in the establishment of the Church of Ireland in Ulster the king made him bishop of Meath, a diocese in the most Anglicized and prosperous part of Ireland. He was allowed to retain Clogher, an extensive but poor diocese, <i>in commendam</i>.<br>
<br>Montgomery built a new episcopal residence at Ardbraccan, co. Meath, the chief manor of his predecessors in Meath diocese. He re-roofed the local parish church, but it does not appear that he was an overly zealous pastor. He was often absent. The royal visitation of Meath diocese in 1622 implies that the churches there were in far worse order shortly after his death than they had been seven years earlier. He had failed, too, to increase the church's resident, let alone its preaching, ministry.<br>
<br>Montgomery arranged for his daughter to marry Nicholas St Lawrence, Lord Howth and one of the leading noblemen of the pale in Ireland, in 1615. He settled &pound;3000 sterling on her as a marriage portion&#151;a &#145;great burden&#146;, as he was to acknowledge to a brother-in-law. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1639), daughter of Edward Brabazon, baron of Ardee, some time after the death of his first wife. Elizabeth, in turn, remarried after the bishop's death.<br>
<br>According to the late seventeenth-century Montgomery manuscripts Montgomery commended James Ussher to James I, and the king was persuaded by his &#145;black Ireland bishop&#146; that Ussher should succeed him in co. Meath  (<span class="italic">Montgomery Manuscripts</span>, 107). Bishop George Montgomery died in Westminster on 15 January 1621. In accordance with his will his body was sent to Ireland to be interred beside his first wife in the vault he had constructed within the parish church at Ardbraccan, co. Meath.<br>
