<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  Thomas</span>, third earl of Sussex  (1526/7&#150;1583), <span class="occ">lord lieutenant of Ireland and courtier</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22981/', "Henry Radcliffe, second earl of Sussex (d. 1557)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22991/', "Radcliffe, Robert, first earl of Sussex")</script>], and his first wife, Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1534), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13939/', "Thomas Howard, second duke of Norfolk")</script>. From his father's accession to the earldom in 1542, he was styled Lord Fitzwalter until he succeeded to the earldom in 1557. Possibly educated in the household of Bishop Steven Gardiner of Winchester, he was at home in Latin and later acquired Italian and perhaps Spanish. There is no evidence he was educated at Cambridge or was admitted to Gray's Inn as sometimes alleged.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Fitzwalter's public career began with his participation in the French campaign of 1544, during which he was knighted by the king at Boulogne on 30 September. In the last years of Henry VIII's reign he figured in court ceremonial occasions and in the lists, and he was a canopy bearer at Henry's funeral. In 1546 he had attended Gardiner on a mission to Brussels and John Dudley on another to France. Probably in 1545 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1555), daughter of Thomas Wriothesley, a match arranged in 1543.<br>
<br>In the new reign the eclipse of Gardiner may have checked Fitzwalter's advance, although he fought at Pinkie Cleugh, narrowly escaping with his life. In 1549 he was appointed captain of Portsmouth, possibly through his father-in-law's temporary influence. He held this post to 1561 when he handed it over to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22982/', "Henry Radcliffe, the future fourth earl")</script>. In 1549 he was one of the notables accompanying Northampton's French embassy to discuss a possible royal match. In 1553 he sat as MP for Norfolk (the other knight was Robert Dudley). With his father he witnessed Edward VI's will in behalf of Lady Jane; but they were not among the notables assigned by Northumberland to rally support in the counties. Father and son were among the first to join Mary at Framlingham, where the earl took command of her forces. Fitzwalter was rewarded with a land grant worth &pound;50 p.a. During Wyatt's rebellion he was among those fighting the rebels at the gates of London. Almost immediately thereafter he was sent to Brussels with a suite of ten men to inform the emperor on recent events. He went with the strong recommendation of the imperial ambassador, Renard, and was warmly received, being detained by Charles so that he might familiarize himself with the Habsburg court. On his return he was employed jointly with the earl of Bedford in a mission to Spain to secure Philip's ratification of the marriage treaty. Warmly entertained, they preceded Philip in their return to England, reaching Southampton in time to greet him on his arrival.<br>
<br>Fitzwalter, who had been summoned to sit in the Lords, was now appointed gentleman of the privy chamber to Philip, a role in which he essayed to learn Spanish. He became a favourite with the king who not only attended his second marriage, to Frances (1531?&#150;1589) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66355/', "Radcliffe, Frances")</script>], daughter of Sir William Sidney, on 24 April 1555, but participated in the jousts. (His first wife had died in January of that year.) He accumulated posts of dignity, becoming captain of the gentlemen pensioners and chief justice of the forests south of the Trent, and was awarded the honour of the Garter. He also went on a mission to Brussels, probably to urge Philip's return, and he was there again in January 1558 to solicit aid for Calais.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinIreland"></a>Service in Ireland</h2>In 1556 Fitzwalter had received his first appointment to a place of power as governor of Ireland and in February 1557 he succeeded to the earldom of Sussex. He went to Dublin, accompanied by his new brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25520/', "Henry Sidney")</script>, appointed under-treasurer and effectively as second in command. Sidney, and later Sir William Fitzwilliam, would serve as Sussex's <i>alter ego</i>, substituting for the earl in the latter's frequent absences in England, totalling some thirty-five months out of his eight years' term.<br>
<br>Sussex's appointment as governor, the first English earl to have held the post since Surrey in 1520, was a token of a new and widened political horizon which now included Ireland as an area of primary concern to the rulers of England&#151;and a land of opportunity for ambitious Englishmen. In the decades since Surrey's sojourn, English policy had come to focus on new and far-reaching aims&#151;nothing less than the establishment of effective royal supremacy throughout the island. This was to be achieved through the full Anglicization of the ruling classes and the duplication of English legal, social, and economic institutions. The options of military conquest had been ruled out in favour of a carrot-and-stick strategy: persuasion backed by force only under necessity. For the several decades preceding Sussex's arrival, it was the former persuasion which had prevailed. The new deputy came, as he wrote in 1560, aiming at a continuation of existing policy but favouring a shift towards stronger measures designed to speed up the process, and for this purpose the English garrison was doubled to 2000. His was to be a new broom, sweeping away the lax habits and congestion of the past decades, imparting new vigour to the commands of royal authority and exacting obedience of them.<br>
<br>On his arrival the new deputy found urgent problems awaiting his attention. His first move was an expedition to expel Gaelic Scots intruders in Antrim, chiefly MacDonalds, a perennial problem in that corner of the island where they were seen as possible agents of Franco-Scottish intrusion. He then turned his attentions to the garrisons in Laois and Offaly, nuclei of a protected colony of English settlers established by his predecessors. The ungenerous terms which he offered those local inhabitants who were to be allowed to remain led them to revolt under their chiefs, O'More and O'Connor. Sussex crushed the revolt and hanged O'More, but continuing resistance in the bogs and woods made any settlement impossible. Not until 1563 were grants, belatedly and vainly, made to an assortment of English, Gaels, and palesmen. Laois and Offaly remained a running sore.<br>
<br>In 1558 Sussex took six months' leave in England, returning to launch a summer expedition against the Scottish isles which left a trail of desolation but failed to assail the MacDonald base of Islay. On Mary's death he returned to London and served as chief sewer at Elizabeth's coronation. Then in February 1559 he made a desperate plea to the queen to allow him to resign the governorship. He argued among other things that the reduced forces she allowed him prevented his carrying out a programme of strong government. He proposed Henry Sidney as his replacement. But the queen was adamant, and in August 1560 Sussex returned. He was now promoted to the full dignity of lord lieutenant.<br>
<br>Sussex soon had to deal with the greatest of the Gaelic lords, Shane O'Neill of Ulster, younger son of the earl of Tyrone. O'Neill was already pushing his claims to succeed to the title, alleging his half-brother illegitimate. In 1557 Sussex had chastised him, ravaging Armagh and forcing him to recognize his father's authority and his brother's rights. When the father died in 1559, O'Neill pressed his claim. Elizabeth was disposed to grant him the earldom but Sussex, who had taken a great dislike to O'Neill, dissuaded her and won consent to an armed expedition against the recalcitrant chief. In the operation which followed in 1561 the lord lieutenant failed to engage his foe and, provisions dwindling, retired to Dublin. Between 1560 and 1563, after a failed attempt to assassinate O'Neill, Sussex launched further expeditions in which he ravaged Tyrone and reclaimed Loch Foyle, but did not catch his elusive prey. Thereupon the queen sent the recently rehabilitated earl of Kildare, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Dudley towards whom Sussex entertained a deep antipathy, to deal with O'Neill. The latter was invited to court, made his peace, and returned to Ulster under a provisional agreement which soon crumbled. The story then repeated itself. Sussex resumed hostilities in 1562 and 1563 without success and in the end Kildare, helped by the palesman lawyer, Sir Thomas Cusack, signed a treaty which gave Shane O'Neill full recognition as the O'Neill.<br>
<br>Sussex had, of course, to deal with the problems raised by the successive religious changes of these years. Under Edward VI enforcement of the new order had been uneven and had been unsuccessful in building a reformed party in the island. Consequently the Marian reversal was welcomed. It was not even thought necessary to undo the dead letter of the Edwardian legislation until Sussex summoned a parliament in 1557. There the Henrician and Edwardian laws were erased and provision made for re-establishing the old order. Hence when Sussex was commanded in 1559 to undo what he had done two years earlier, he faced a recalcitrant community. He did his best to pack the upper chamber, but it was beyond his power to do the same in the lower. The four-week session which ensued is veiled in utmost obscurity, but the government's bills were enacted; immediate dissolution followed while the governor departed for England in obedience to royal command. Later Irish tradition held that the enactment was achieved in the face of strong opposition by trickery. The houses were told they would not be sitting on the day the bills were pushed through. More recent research seems to show there was no irregularity.<br>
<br>Sussex had little success on other fronts. In Mary's reign he had been criticized by the Geraldine earls and primate Dowdall for his harsh action in Laois and Offaly, and in Armagh. While there were protests to Westminster from the palesmen against heavy taxation and debasement of the coinage, Sussex's position at court was strong enough to fend off his critics.<h2>
<a name="Recall"></a>Recall</h2>Under Elizabeth, Sussex was more vulnerable. When petitions from a group of law students in the pale and later from the pale gentry reached court, they got a hearing thanks to the intercession of Robert Dudley. Then an agent of the pale gentry, William Bermingham, enlarged the charges, alleging corruption and negligence in the army with the wastage of large sums. For a queen obsessed with the need for economy, these were grave matters. A special commissioner, Sir Nicholas Arnold, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Dudley, was dispatched to investigate and his findings led to a further commission of two with a very large remit, including the handling of religion and an alleged plot to poison O'Neill. This was a direct challenge to Sussex's authority. When his attempt to dispatch another army against O'Neill was disallowed and the treaty mentioned above approved, Sussex's humiliation was complete. From December 1563 he was seriously ill; his friends urged his recall on grounds of health and in May 1564 he left Ireland for good.<br>
<br>Sussex had little cause for satisfaction in the record of his administration. Not only had his hostility to O'Neill wrecked the chance of an accommodation with the Ulster chief, but his policy in the pale had aroused the discontent of a community hitherto loyal to the English crown. Pushing aside the local &eacute;lite accustomed to the confidence of the governor and employment in the crown's business, Sussex brought in a retinue of Englishmen, eager to advance their fortunes in this new area of politics. Insulated from local opinion, Sussex went far to arouse the resentment of a community which was the pillar of English authority in the island. They were also offended by the unaccustomed burden of taxation which he levied on the pale in order to support his frequent military campaigns. Another important bloc, the Anglo-Irish earls, was alienated by his hostility to Kildare and Desmond. Lastly, Sussex's forthright, single-minded, and impatient style was ill-suited to the infinite complexities and ambiguities of Irish affairs.<br>
<br>Nevertheless Sussex had learned from experience. In 1562 he presented the queen with a detailed set of recommendations for the governance of Ireland, proposing the establishment of provincial councils, modelled on the council in the marches of Wales and the council of the north, each headed by an English president with local associates and each backed by a small contingent of armed men. The Ulster president was to have increased powers and more armed force. He proposed law codes which would blend Brehon (Gaelic) and common law. Overall there was to be more effort at patient and peaceful persuasion. None of the ideas was individually new but he set forward a coherent, clearly articulated programme, much of which would be adopted by his successor, Sidney. What it revealed about Sussex was a capacity for understanding some of his own errors and in the process advancing a considered plan for long-term policy. In spite of his blunders he had learned something about Ireland. His influence on English policy in Ireland would last well beyond his term of office there.<br>
<br>Sussex's recall was in no small part due to his own failures, but there were powerful forces in the English court working to achieve his downfall. Robert Dudley had backed the rehabilitation of Kildare, had entertained O'Neill on his English visit, and patronized the discontented palesmen. The commissioner sent to investigate complaints, Sir Nicholas Arnold, was his nominee. Dudley's motives seem not to have been personal but wholly political. Seeing the new opportunities for influence and patronage which Ireland offered, he moved to stake out a claim.<h2>
<a name="TheAustrianmatch"></a>The Austrian match</h2>Although Sussex left Ireland under a cloud, he had no difficulty in re-entering the court world. He had always seen the Irish adventure as a short-term enterprise whence, having won a reputation, he could return to the main stage of English politics. By virtue of his rank, his past experience, and his family connection with Norfolk, he found easy readmission to the court political scene. There he quickly identified with the circle clustered around the duke of Norfolk, and soon found a role which satisfied both his public and private concerns&#151;campaigning for Elizabeth's marriage to the Austrian Archduke Charles. He was convinced of the necessity of a royal husband to provide for the succession and stabilize domestic politics. An Austrian match, the best possible, would also stabilize England's international situation by renewing the traditional Burgundian connection without incurring the problems posed by a match with another sovereign.<br>
<br>This position, of course, conflicted with the marital ambitions of Dudley, a man Sussex now cordially detested. In 1560 Sussex had expressed approval of the Austrian match to a disapproving Cecil, but in 1561 and again in 1562 had urged the assembled Garter knights to petition the queen to marry Lord Robert. The latter's attack on his Irish government had altered his view. In any case the personal animosities of the two earls (Dudley was now earl of Leicester) were soon intertwined with the marriage issue. Hostility between them would flare up intermittently until Sussex's death, although it would be an error to see a long-term factional division in the court between their respective partisans. The two would sit together in council and on committees and not infrequently join forces on a particular issue.<br>
<br>When an imperial envoy arrived in London in 1565 Sussex worked hard lobbying him, seeking to convince the Austrian that Elizabeth was serious in her intentions to entice the archduke to a visit to England, but nothing definite was arrived at. Pressure on Elizabeth to marry continued from council, court, and parliament, while the rivalry between Leicester and his opponents convulsed the court. In summer 1565 and again a year later there were open confrontations between the earls; royal intervention was required when Leicester accused Sussex of dealings with the Irish rebel, O'Neill. Sussex on his part was harassing his replacement at Dublin, Henry Sidney, Leicester's brother-in-law and prot&eacute;g&eacute;. A public reconciliation enforced by the queen papered over the quarrel, but in the winter of 1565&#150;6 adherents of the two rivals sported coloured badges, purple for the Norfolk and Sussex followers, yellow for Leicester's; and the courtiers went about armed. The continued pressure on the queen to marry, focused in the 1566 parliament, pushed her to act and in November of that year she appointed Sussex to a mission to Vienna to discuss marriage. Royal vacillation delayed his departure to June 1567. He went still apprehensive as to Elizabeth's intentions, conscious of the strong opposition and royal irresolution. How far could he risk his own credit in the cause? He was accompanied by Lord North, allegedly placed there by the opposition to checkmate him.<br>
<br>The emperor and his brother proved amenable to the match but reserved the latter's right to exercise his own religion. Henry Cobham was dispatched to London with this information. While waiting for the queen's response Sussex worked out a compromise with Charles by which the latter would have a private mass in his own quarters but attend the queen in public religious ceremonial. Cobham's letter was debated by a divided council, Norfolk ill and absent. The queen's reply fudged the issues, but a refusal to make exceptions for the archduke's religion effectively ended negotiations. Sussex, bitterly disappointed, condemned those who used religion as a cloak for their real aims, particularly &#145;the party&#146;&#151;probably North&#151;who, he believed, had persuaded both courts that agreement was impossible. Sussex's persistence in pressing Elizabeth to a decision she was unwilling to make did not halt further employment in her service, but it did identify him as one of the Norfolk circle, a band of nobles conservative in religion. He did in fact go so far as to vote against the bill to secure the bishops' legal authority.<h2>
<a name="Presidentofthenorth"></a>President of the north</h2>Back at court, Sussex directed his energy to the pursuit of office. He aimed first at the presidency of Wales and the marches held by Henry Sidney, now Irish governor. Allegedly the queen promised him the post, but Leicester defeated his efforts and secured his brother-in-law's continuance in office. The queen, however, found Sussex a consolation appointment in the presidency of the council of the north, opportunely vacant. He took up the office in July 1568. Almost immediately he found himself involved in another highly sensitive mission. Mary Stuart had fled to England in May. She sought support for her restoration; the regent Moray adamantly opposed it, alleging her involvement in Darnley's murder. In October Elizabeth appointed a commission to hear both sides. Norfolk was chairman, his colleagues Sussex and the veteran councillor Sir Ralph Sadler. They were to listen to the evidence presented and report what they heard for the queen's future judgment.<br>
<br>Sussex had in 1565 been thought too favourable to the Scottish queen to be sent on a mission during the Darnley marriage crisis. At that time he had bluntly expressed his views on the troubled relations between the queens. Mary should yield her claims to present possession, marry an Englishman, and in return receive recognition of her place in the succession. The commission, having held its hearing and reported, was summoned to London to join the privy council and the other earls in hearing the evidence. Sussex joined in approving Elizabeth's decision not to make a judgment, but to send Mary to Tutbury, where, he wrote, she would be a &#145;nearer guest&#146;. Sussex had already in early October given his own judgment: Mary must at all costs be kept in England; a trial would be unwise for all concerned. She should be persuaded to abdicate on the promise that there would be no trial. If she refused she should then be simply detained; Moray should be backed while Elizabeth became the arbiter of Scottish affairs.<br>
<br>The next chapter of Mary's history touched Sussex sorely. In spring 1569 a scheme was set afoot, backed by a surprisingly wide range of supporters, to marry Norfolk to Mary and to overthrow Secretary Cecil. The latter effort fizzled out, but the marriage was actively pursued. Norfolk's agent approached Sussex for support. The latter dodged a direct answer, pleading his distance from the political scene, expressing surprise at the proposal, and warning the duke against false advisers (Leicester was party to the plot). He did not inform Cecil of the approach. When the plot unravelled, this contact was revealed. It led to a letter from Cecil to Sussex, now lost, the contents of which are clear from the latter's reply. Cecil had expressed belief in Sussex's loyalty but he had also uttered a warning: Sussex must deal plainly with him or not at all. The earl replied defensively, asserting his plain dealing in relationships: &#145;I know no cunning nor will learn one&#146;  (Wright, 1.320&#150;27). Sussex went on to lament Norfolk's fall from grace, wishing he had been present to give better counsel and urging leniency and forbearance towards the duke.<br>
<br>Hard upon the Norfolk marriage affair&#151;triggered by it&#151;came the rising of the northern earls. Sussex's past associations placed him under suspicion. His enemies at court were quick to stoke the fire. His brother Sir Henry wrote anxiously from court, wishing the earl could be present to defend himself. Suspicion grew when Sussex's half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22979/', "Egremont Radcliffe")</script>, joined the rebels. The situation was worsened by the course of events. Sussex had met the council's warning of unrest in the north with optimistic reassurances. When the storm broke, he acted with vigour, but the initial response of the country was sluggish. Complaints came from London about his slowness, and the queen rebuked him for allowing Northumberland's escape. She now sent Sir Henry Sadler, the privy councillor, and her cousin Lord Hunsdon, to assist Sussex. On arrival, both, after preliminary queries, wrote strongly affirmative reports on the president, justifying his slowness to act by the inadequacy of the force at his disposal. Within a couple of weeks, the country rallied to Sussex's call while additional forces came from the south, commanded by Warwick and Clinton. The rising fizzled out before Christmas without bloodshed as the earls fled to Scotland. Sussex's vigorous leadership had in fact counted heavily in rallying a somewhat wavering countryside to the crown's support.<br>
<br>Sussex's position was much improved, although the queen could still complain about the clemency shown the meaner prisoners while the earl, writing grumpily of Warwick and Clinton's intrusion on his authority, could talk of retirement. As late as February 1570 the vice-president and other council members were writing to deny that the earl had pressured them into accepting the Norfolk match. In January Sussex had leave to attend at court, where he defended his actions before the queen and council and received a clean bill of health. He had an interview with the queen about which he wrote to Cecil. She had shown her favour and confidence by continuing him in office, but Sussex complained the world would see this as mere approval of his services, not as evidence of her good affection towards him. She had declared she would deal with him so that the world would know, although nothing specific was mentioned. Then&#151;a broad hint&#151;he listed his personal expenses in the twelve years of service to the crown: leases sold worth &pound;12,700. He had had no benefit other than ordinary fees. The lack of reward for his service had aroused comment elsewhere, Lord Hunsdon, among others, expressing his surprise.<br>
<br>Sussex's services were now required on the border, where he returned in March 1570. The assassination of Moray had thrown Scottish affairs into disarray; civil war raged between the king's party and the Marians; the latter sheltered English fugitives, who spawned border disorder. Sussex had in January prepared a raid into Scotland, but the queen refused to allow it and reduced his forces. However, by March she was convinced of the necessity for action and authorized a campaign which Sussex carried out in later April, ravaging the eastern Borders while Lord Scrope swept through the western. Sussex was convinced the queen must assist the king's party, which was weaker, importuned her to act, and fumed at her indecision. On his own he opened negotiations with regent Morton's supporters and helped restore their morale. The queen finally agreed to send money and lend aid in mid-May. An English force commanded by Sir William Drury drove the Marians back to Glasgow, but a proposed siege of Dumbarton was halted by Elizabeth.<br>
<br>She was now eager to demobilize, but Sussex dragged his feet while negotiating with the Marians for general disarmament. This engaged him in an exchange with Maitland of Lethington on the subject of loyalty. (Maitland had changed sides.) Sussex displayed both learning and intellectual verve in letters well laced with Latin quotations. This won a letter of royal praise which must have warmed his heart. She praised him for a sufficiency of wisdom mixed with good learning &#145;as would over match Maitland, the flower of Scottish wit&#146;. She added, &#145;truly, cousin, we have always judged you wise and we know you sufficient for the place you hold but we have not seen at any time a more absolute proof of your wit and learning&#146;  (Wright, 1.369&#150;70). Elizabeth throughout these operations had expressed approval of his actions and confidence in him. Sussex's intellectual skills did not achieve the pacification he hoped for, and the queen authorized a third raid in August and September. Scotland, although by no means settled, no longer constituted a danger to the Borders and in late December Sussex was back in London.<h2>
<a name="Privycouncillor"></a>Privy councillor</h2>The last trace of suspicion wiped away by his service, Sussex received the public display of royal confidence he longed for with his appointment as privy councillor on 30 December 1570. He remained an absentee president until 1572. In that year Elizabeth appointed him lord chamberlain of the household in succession to Howard of Effingham. Material benefits followed. In 1572 there was a grant of lands in Somerset, part of the Glastonbury Abbey estate. In 1574 he received the honour of Beaulieu in Essex, a cluster of manors, and the mansion of New Hall, a residence of Henry VIII, to which Sussex made extensive alterations. In the same year he had licence to export &pound;2000 worth of woollen cloth free of custom, which he sold for &pound;3200. For the remainder of his career Sussex was a diligent member of the council, a regular attender, and an active participant in the central business of state. He now sat at the same board as Leicester, a colleague not only there, but also very frequently on special committees. There were occasional flare-ups, as in 1581 and again the next year. Although the causes are obscure, the first of the two required Elizabeth's intervention. In 1578 there had also been a row with Lord North, who had disparaged Sussex's handling of his duties as chamberlain. Sussex saw the episode as a deliberate attack by Leicester's followers.<br>
<br>If Sussex had an enemy in Leicester, he had a firm friend in Cecil. The secretary had been a sympathetic supporter as early as Sussex's Irish days, giving helpful advice, warning of critics at court, and playing down his failures. Cecil shared Sussex's views on the Habsburg marriage and the queen of Scots. He stood by Sussex in 1569&#150;70 and must have welcomed a councillor who shared so many of his own goals. In the years which followed they almost always stood together on major issues. How close and personal the relationship was is revealed in two letters from Sussex to the lord treasurer. In 1578 he wrote that he would on all occasions &#145;stick as near to you as your shirt on your back&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 2.224&#150;5). Two years later he declared that he and his wife &#145;love, honour and obey as a father and will do all service to you&#146;  (ibid., 2.326&#150;7).<br>
<br>Sussex's role in council business can to some degree be gauged by his membership on special committees, charged with important and sensitive tasks. Three names recur regularly on such committees: Burghley, Leicester, and Sussex; more variably appear Hatton and Walsingham. In 1576 the trio were to deal with the prince of Orange, in 1578 to receive a special French embassy, in 1581 to negotiate on marriage with Simier, Anjou's agent, or to deal with the Terceira caravel problem in the same year. In the Simier negotiations they reported back to the full council and in turn conveyed council opinion to the queen. These assignments are testimony to Sussex's role as a member of a trio (himself, Burghley, and Leicester) who formed an inner core within the council (joined frequently by Walsingham and Hatton) in whom rested the centre of power in that body.<br>
<br>Two great problems engaged the council's attention in the 1570s, the successive marriage negotiations with France and the gathering crisis in the Low Countries. In the exchanges of 1570&#150;71 over a match with Henry, duke of Anjou, Sussex as a newcomer on the council played a slight role, voting for it along with Burghley. It is just possible that his name had cropped up in the unfolding Ridolfi plot, reawakening old doubts. In the prolonged on-again, off-again negotiations for the hand of Henry's younger brother, Francis, duke of Alen&ccedil;on, Sussex played a significant part. In the first 1572 phase he backed Cecil in supporting the match until the St Bartholomew's day massacre put a stop to proceedings. When in 1576 a league was proposed to include Anjou (as Francis now was), the elector Palatine, and the Huguenots, to force Henri III to accept a toleration edict, Sussex firmly rejected it, doubting the Huguenots could win; more probably they would be utterly ruined. The queen, he argued, could not procure peace by war. She should look at the marriage scheme again. Events foreclosed the proposed league.<br>
<br>Sussex's initial attitude towards the Dutch revolt was shaped by his anxiety to avoid war and he steadily backed proposals for Elizabeth's mediation, but when, for a moment in 1576, the seventeen provinces were united in revolt, he favoured financial aid and even armed intervention. However, he soon returned to his previous views. Then in 1578 news arrived that Anjou was treating for leadership of the state's forces. Sussex's comment on this development was that the queen's case (and England's) would be hard &#145;if either the French possess or the Spanish tyrannise in the Low Countries&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 63/8, no. 13). There must be a balance so that neither Spain nor France should triumph over the other.<br>
<br>Sussex now, with the queen's backing, took the initiative (without Cecil's knowledge), when he contacted the resident French ambassador, Mauvissi&egrave;re, to propose reopening the marriage question. He was convinced that only marriage could divert Anjou's search for a role in the Low Countries on one side or the other. For Sussex the overriding concern was to avoid war with Philip, and that could be done only by joint Anglo-French pressure. Here was the chance to achieve that goal. Anjou's marriage to Elizabeth would cement their co-operation and pressure Philip into accepting a compromise in the Low Countries. Lastly, the earl still had a lingering hope that Elizabeth might yet bear a child and resolve the succession problem.<br>
<br>Sussex, steadfast in this policy, found an ally in Burghley (previously opposed to the marriage) during the prolonged council debate in spring 1579. Temporarily successful, they persuaded Elizabeth to invite Anjou to England. In October both were members of a committee to debate the marriage, but they failed to carry the full council in recommending it. In 1580, when anarchy in France seemed to leave England no option but intervention in the Low Countries, Sussex continued to oppose such a move. In 1582 he served on another committee, ostensibly to revive the match, but actually to seek alliance in lieu of her hand. This ended Sussex's co-operation with Leicester, who favoured the war. He had throughout the 1570s supported a clearly conceived policy, pivoting on his determination to avoid war through a marital alliance with France and joint pressure on Philip. When Sussex died, hopes for peace were fast fading. In failing health in 1582, Sussex died on 9 June 1583 in his house at Bermondsey, where his bowels were buried in the church; his body was interred at Boreham in Essex in the red brick building adjoining the church he had built. A large altar tomb features recumbent figures in memory of the first three earls of Sussex.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>In a public career of nearly forty years Sussex had held office under three monarchs. He had enjoyed highly favourable circumstances in pursuit of that career. Among his colleagues on the council he was one of the few who inherited free entry into the world of high politics. This advantage had opened the way to the Irish viceroyalty and also insured that after a poor record there he could effortlessly re-enter the public arena. A second advantage of great importance was his relationship with Cecil, who supported him even in the Irish years and sustained him in the difficulties of 1569&#150;70. The relationship was, however, as much one of association as dependence. Usually in agreement with Cecil, Sussex did not hesitate to differ. The royal confidence was won more slowly. Only after the testing time of the northern uprising was it fully accorded. Thus, even though he had the advantage of birth, it was merit which won him the trust of those two demanding judges, Elizabeth and Cecil.<br>
<br>What sets Sussex apart from most of his contemporaries was his independence, both in judgement and in action. He had no visible ideological commitment, in spite of his intimacy with a group of noblemen regarded as Catholic sympathizers, and he displayed no confessional bias. He found it easy to contemplate a Catholic consort if that concession guaranteed English security. Void of strong religious commitment, he was insensitive to the protestant outcry against a Catholic husband. This left him free to formulate a wholly pragmatic view of English foreign relations. Sussex's analysis of problems showed him a shrewd diagnostician, but when it came to prescribing remedies he was less perceptive. Solutions for him were straightforward, the alternatives black and white. He was apt to brush aside the nuances, the complexities, the ambiguities surrounding any decision. The queen's hesitation only aroused his impatience. He was curiously indifferent to the religious passions of the age and deaf to the clamours of the anti-papists.<br>
<br>Sussex did not share the driving ambition of most of his fellow councillors. Two prizes he had inherited: title and estate; the latter yielded somewhere between &pound;1000 and &pound;2000 p.a., not a grand figure but a substantial base. Childless, he had no need to provide for his posterity and was content to leave an estate ruinously indebted to the crown. In his early years he sought power, first in Ireland and then in the north, but after accession to the council, he was content to be a participant, saying his say, but eschewing any desire to impose his will or dominate decision making. This left him free to advocate what seemed to him to be best for the realm. This independence meant that he could press on the queen courses of action unpalatable to her, from which the more politic Burghley would shy.<br>
<br>Of Sussex outside his public life there is not much to be said. He patronized a company of players, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, but showed no interest in their productions. He counted no dedications by hopeful authors. His religious views were coolly neutral although he took care to fill the livings in his grant with men of learning and integrity. His personal character, so far as it comes across, is that of a downright man, firm and articulate in his opinions but able to work in a team with fellow politicians, even with the &#145;Gypsy&#146;, Leicester, his life-long foe.<br>
