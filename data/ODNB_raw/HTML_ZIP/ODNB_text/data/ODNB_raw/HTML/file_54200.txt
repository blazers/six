<span class="headword">Turnor,  Philip</span>  (1750/51&#150;1799/1800), <span class="occ">land surveyor and map maker</span>, came from Laleham, Middlesex, and was originally engaged in farming. He first comes to notice in the records of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) for 1778. By this date the HBC committee in London had a tradition of developing strategies and issuing instructions for its operations more than 3000 miles away in Rupert's Land. It had recognized the need to compete effectively in the interior with the more aggressive Montreal-based Canadian fur traders; in particular to build posts far up the rivers from the company's established bay-side forts. But it lacked reliable maps with which to plan. In 1775, of its sixty or so manuscript maps and plans, very few were of the interior. Recognizing the need to produce new and reliable ones, the committee sought the advice of the astronomer William Wales FRS. Wales recommended Philip Turnor's appointment as the first of the company's inland surveyors.<br>
<br>Turnor's first contract with the company, of 6 May 1778, engaged him for &#145;Three Years&#146; at &#145;Fifty Pounds per Year&#146;  (HBC records, A32/3, fol. 27). He was competent in mathematics and surveying and from the beginning his status was fairly high among HBC employees. With a salary more than five times that of a labourer on first contract, he ate at the captain's table on his first voyage to York Fort (now in Manitoba) and with the chief factor on arrival. Wales was paid 5 guineas for having recommended him.<br>
<br>Turnor served four three-year contracts in Rupert's Land, from August 1778 to September 1787 and August 1789 to September 1792. His first duty on reaching York Fort was to survey it, examine the fabric of its buildings, and send a report back to the London committee. Drawn in the month of his arrival, the large-scale plan was the first of at least nine maps and numerous plans he was to make for the company  (HBC records, G1/109). Within a few days of completing it he was sent to Cumberland House (now in Saskatchewan). Thereafter he spent most of his time in the interior: in 1778&#150;9 on the Saskatchewan River, in 1779&#150;87 to the south of James Bay, and in 1789&#150;92 at and beyond Cumberland House. He adapted quickly to travel and subsistence in the lichen woodlands and coniferous forests of which he had no previous experience, snaring birds and hunting small mammals within weeks of arrival and walking, snow-shoeing, and canoeing more than 4000 miles during his first two years. Apart from occasional snow blindness and a winter with rheumatism, he was healthy and strong.<br>
<br>In 1782 Turnor was appointed master at Brunswick House, at the confluence of the Opasatika and Missinaibi rivers. Between then and 1787 he mixed trading for marten, muskrat, and other pelts with occasional surveying and map making. As a master, he implemented instructions, managed the post, supervised employees, traded with Indians, and maintained correspondence, but it was as astronomer, mathematician, surveyor, cartographer, and teacher of these skills that the committee most valued him.<br>
<br>Between 1778 and 1782 Turnor<blockquote>prepared three original maps and several copies. He observed and calculated the astronomical locations of all the HBC's factories and posts, of the significant junctions of the interior waterways, and of important geographical features along the sea coasts, all of which he had visited. (Ruggles, 49)</blockquote>From 1782 to 1787 Turnor devoted less time to such activities but surveyed several of the rivers draining into James Bay, usually doing so on return&#151;downstream&#151;journeys. Between 1789 and 1792 he led an exploring and mapping expedition into the beaver- and marten-rich Athabasca country, in which Canadians had been trading with Indians for nearly a decade but about which the HBC knew almost nothing. His observation of the latitude and longitude of Fort Chipewyan (now in Alberta), when compared with those made on the Pacific coast by Captain James Cook gave Alexander Mackenzie some real comprehension of the extent of the country through which he was to pass in 1793 in the first crossing of the continent by a European.<br>
<br>Turnor returned to England for the last time in October 1792 but soon afterwards the committee decided to pay him &#145;one guinea per week until further orders&#146;  (HBC records, A1/47, fol. 4). Between then and early 1795 he compiled several manuscript maps, of which the last is now considered one of Canada's greatest cartographic treasures. &#145;To the Honourable Governor &hellip; This Map of Hudson's Bay and the Rivers and Lakes Between the Atlantick and Pacifick Oceans&#146;  (HBC records, G2/32) is very large (193 cm &times; 259 cm). It has an exquisite cartouche attributed to Edward Dayes, the London topographical watercolourist  (Turner, 8.584), and at least some of the calligraphy was by one of two artist&#150;engraver brothers Charles and Peltro William Tomkins  (ibid., 31.137). The map is a composite of information available in 1794 from Turnor's own calculations, sketches, and previously completed maps as well as those of others, fitted onto a graticule &#145;he himself had done so much to perfect&#146;  (Ruggles, 54). In 1795 the committee paid him &pound;100 for the map and presented him with the HBC watch he had carried for many years  (HBC records, A1/47, fol. 47). Though the map was never published, the committee gave Aaron Arrowsmith almost immediate access to it and it formed the basis of his &#145;Map exhibiting all the new discoveries in the interior parts of North America&#146; (1795).<br>
<br>Little is known of Turnor's later life. In or about 1794 his address was Prospect Row, Dock Head, Rotherhithe, London, where he taught navigation. John Turnor, captain of an HBC sloop, is said to have been a brother  (Rich, <span class="italic">Hudson's Bay Company</span>, 88&#150;9, 98), though whether he was the John Turner who captained company trans-Atlantic supply ships between 1790 and 1816 is less clear  (Cooke and Holland, 439). Philip Turnor last wrote to the company on 4 December 1799. On 26 March 1800 the London committee read a petition from his widow, Elizabeth, praying for pecuniary assistance. He had presumably married either during his furlough in 1787&#150;9 or after his return to England in 1792.<br>
<br>Turnor's influence on the mapping of Rupert's Land continued after his death as a result of his surprising choice of assistant surveyor for the Athabasca expedition. In 1790, having rejected three men trained in astronomical observation, he selected <a name="cosubject_54201"></a><span class="headword">Peter Fidler</span>  (1769&#150;1822), <span class="occ">surveyor and cartographer</span>, from Bolsover, Derbyshire. Fidler, born on 16 August 1769, was the son of James and Mary Fidler, and had joined the company as a general labourer in the previous year. Reasonably well educated he had sufficient mathematical training to pick up practical astronomy quickly. He was also physically strong, keen to learn, and ambitious. Turnor trained him in surveying, field sketching, and cartography, and encouraged him to live, travel, and communicate with Indians. His wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1826), with whom he had fourteen children, was a Swampy Cree Indian. (Their long-standing union was solemnized on 14 August 1821.) Fidler succeeded Turnor as the company's chief surveyor and between 1790 and 1820 made eighty separate maps and 373 segmented sketch maps, more than any other company cartographer. Although his methods were those of Turnor he developed a distinctive map making procedure that had hitherto been used by company employees only very occasionally. He regularly asked Indians and company colleagues for descriptions and sketches of areas and routes known to them and in this way produced forty-four maps. He retired from the HBC in 1821, but stayed in Rupert's Land and died at Fort Dauphin (Dauphin, Manitoba) on 17 December 1822.<br>
