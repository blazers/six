<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  George</span>  (1755&#150;1817), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, was born on 5 March 1755, the third but second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22498/', "John Ponsonby (1713&#150;1789)")</script>, speaker of the Irish House of Commons (1756&#150;71), and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish (1723&#150;1796), daughter of the third duke of Devonshire. Having received his schooling at Dr Benson's school, Fownes' Court, Dublin, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner on 1 December 1773 but he did not graduate. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn in February 1776 he appeared to have found his true calling, since he entered the office of a special pleader and &#145;read law, a thing seldom done by the generality of students&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hibernian Magazine</span>, 1782, 97&#150;8). Called to the Irish bar in 1780, a year before he married (on 18 May 1781) Lady Mary Butler (1755&#150;1826), the daughter of the earl of Lanesborough, he was admitted to the inner bar two years later.<br>
<br>Ponsonby's early promotion has been attributed to the intervention of the duke of Portland, since he had yet to distinguish himself as an advocate. This is plausible, as his father's decision to leave the direction of the sizeable family political interest to George and to George's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22506/', "William Brabazon Ponsonby")</script>, following his own failure to regain the speaker's chair in 1776, meant that George Ponsonby was someone whom successive lords lieutenant ignored at their peril. He certainly profited personally. First elected to the Irish parliament as representative for the borough of Wicklow in 1777, he was made clerk of the ships' entries, worth &pound;500 p.a., by Lord Carlisle in 1781. Carlisle's successor, the duke of Portland, controversially appointed him to the coveted position of counsel to the revenue commissioners (worth &pound;1400 p.a.). In return Ponsonby stood forward bravely in support of the administration in the House of Commons on 16 April 1782 but, when he realized that the patriots would not compromise their demand for &#145;legislative independence&#146;, he promptly acceded to the weight of public and political opinion. Though he still possessed the reputation of a man who was more interested in field sports than in business Ponsonby shrewdly assured Portland of his attachment on the formation of the Fox&#150;North coalition. The coalition did not bring him further preferment but his courting of Portland demonstrated his independence of his father, who admitted that he &#145;could not manage him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 1.210). Conscious of the expectation of him as an office-holder, and fully aware that to do otherwise would be disadvantageous both personally and politically, Ponsonby supported the administration throughout the mid-1780s. His vote, and the votes of his family interest, could not be assumed, as he demonstrated in 1785, when the commercial propositions were being agitated, but his stand in opposition to parliamentary reform in November 1783, pension reform in 1786, and tithe reform in 1787 was not unappreciated. &#145;He does not&#146;, one Dublin Castle insider acknowledged, &#145;want abilities&#146; but the fact that the administration did not believe him &#145;fit for high promotion&#146; demonstrates that he was not deemed entirely trustworthy  (Johnston and others, 198). Given Ponsonby's known whig sympathies this was a defensible conclusion, and his strong support for an address from the Irish parliament to George, prince of Wales, inviting him to become regent in 1789, indicated that the administration had got him right. It was logical therefore, following the failure to bring a regency into being, his subsequent dismissal as counsel to the revenue, and his founding membership of the Irish Whig Club, that he should embrace the politics of opposition.<br>
<br>Pursuant to his role as an Irish whig MP George Ponsonby took an increasingly liberal political stand in the 1790s. In 1790 he inveighed strongly against the sizeable increase in the pension list authorized by the marquess of Buckingham. His efforts in 1790 and 1791 to make a political issue of the partisan adjudication over the law on the employment of <i>fiats</i> by the chief justice of the king's bench, Lord Clonmell, in the celebrated case of <i>John McGee v. Francis Higgins</i>, elevated him in the public mind into the company of Henry Grattan and John Philpot Curran as one of the leading opposition voices in the House of Commons. Parallel with this his advocacy in a number of high-profile political legal cases&#151;of which that on behalf of the common council of Dublin corporation against the court of aldermen, in their contest over the election of a lord mayor in 1790, was the most celebrated&#151;increased his popular appeal and enhanced his reputation as an advocate of distinction. In practice, like many whigs Ponsonby was more than a little uneasy at the direction of political events in the early 1790s. His remark to Napper Tandy in December 1791 &#145;that any attempt to introduce French systems, and the coalition between Catholic and Dissenter for those purposes, would oblige the opposition to throw themselves into the arms of government, and to press an immediate union with Great Britain&#146; illustrates how perturbed he was by the foundation of the United Irishmen  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 2.238). His observation on the passage of the 1792 relief act, that Catholics should not expect further relief soon, was consonant with this but it is a measure of Ponsonby's capacity to adapt in this fast-changing environment that he was able to argue in 1793 that assertions that Catholics should not be enfranchised were &#145;inconsistent with reason&#146;  (<span class="italic">Parliamentary Register (Ireland)</span>, 8.273). Significantly he introduced a bill for &#145;the more equal representation of the people in parliament&#146; late the same session. The bill did not become law but both he and &#145;the reasonably well-disciplined&#146; Irish whig party  (Malcomson, 202), received a potentially glorious opportunity to shape the political future when he was controversially designated attorney-general in the administration of Earl Fitzwilliam. It was the post for which &#145;he was most peculiarly qualified as well by his professional knowledge and talents, as by his parliamentary eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Carlisle MSS</span>, 705). Had Fitzwilliam remained in office Ponsonby would have played the leading role with Henry Grattan in 1795 in admitting Catholics to parliament, among a range of other reforms aimed at healing the growing political cleavages in Irish society. Instead its dramatic collapse disenchanted him, and his inability in the two sessions that followed to advance plans for Catholic relief and for parliamentary reform prompted him and other Irish whigs to withdraw in protest from the House of Commons in 1797.<br>
<br>Ponsonby did not remain out of politics for long. Though he busied himself defending suspected rebels in the aftermath of the 1798 rising the realization that the government was intent on agitating a legislative union prompted his return to the House of Commons as MP for Galway in 1798 and, until Henry Grattan joined him there in 1800, he was &#145;the chief conductor of opposition&#146; to the measure  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 3.238). His finest moment came on 22 January 1799, when his intervention effectively prevented the advancement of the union that session, but his best efforts were repeatedly repulsed in 1800. Despite his determined opposition to the abolition of the Irish legislature Ponsonby adjusted easily and well to the imperial parliament when he took his seat for co. Wicklow in 1801. Because he was an experienced politician with well-established connections in the whig party hierarchy much was expected of him, and he fulfilled these high expectations by taking an active part in debate on his entry into the house. He did not sustain this level of engagement but his eminence and ability ensured that he achieved his goal of the Irish lord chancellorship on the formation of the Fox&#150;Grenville ministry in 1806.<br>
<br>It cannot be said that Ponsonby made much of a mark in the short time that he held this office, but he did his reputation no harm and before the government fell he was being heralded as potentially &#145;the most effective leader&#146; of the whigs in the House of Commons  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 8.347). Ponsonby, by his own admission, had &#145;really and truly no wish for the situation&#146;; he believed he was &#145;not qualified for it&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Grey</span>, 152) but nobody else was acceptable to the rival Foxite and Grenvillite wings of the party. The Catholic question was one issue upon which they could unite but Ponsonby's enthusiastic endorsement of an extensive state veto on Catholic ecclesiastical appointments in 1808 caused him considerable trouble in Ireland. As the representative for Tavistock (1808&#150;12) and for Peterborough (1812&#150;16) Ponsonby could afford to disregard criticism from this quarter. His lack of fire and his failure to strike a telling blow at the government, arising out of its supposed mismanagement of the war in Spain and other matters, caused some to suggest in 1809 that Lord Henry Petty should take over as leader of the whigs, but Petty's elevation to the Lords caused Ponsonby to withdraw his offer to step aside. Ponsonby resolved to &#145;be a good deal more stout&#146; thereafter but his resort to the line of argument appealed to by the Irish whigs in 1789, during the debates on a regency in December 1810, did not impress  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 10.34). In addition he lacked the &#145;firmness and resolution&#146; demanded of a party leader  (ibid., 141). He continued to perform capably in the Commons and to conduct himself honourably but he was, and remained, a stopgap leader until his death, which occurred on 8 July 1817 at his London home in Curzon Street, eight days after he was seized by paralysis in the chamber of the house. He was buried, appropriately, in Kensington church, since in his later political life he was a visible personification of the union of British and Irish politics that came into being on 1 January 1801.<br>
