<span class="headword">Dunlop,  John, of Gairbraid</span>  (1789&#150;1868), <span class="occ">temperance campaigner</span>, was born in the Dellingburn district of Greenock, Renfrewshire, on 2 August 1789, the eldest of the four children of Alexander Dunlop (1766&#150;1840), of Keppoch, Dunbartonshire, merchant and banker, and his first wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Graham (1769&#150;1795). His youngest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37377/', "William Dunlop")</script>, writer, surgeon, and Canadian pioneer, while his half-brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8272/', "Alexander Colquhoun-Stirling-Murray-Dunlop")</script>, lawyer and Liberal politician. Both sides of his family had roots in the west of Scotland gentry, with the landed estate of Gairbraid, Lanarkshire, to the north of Glasgow, becoming Dunlop's inheritance through his mother's line.<br>
<br>Dunlop's formative years were spent in Greenock, a seaport where his father had shipping interests and in 1802 co-founded the Renfrewshire Banking Company. Alexander Dunlop remarried a year after his wife's death in 1795 and the dislocation to the family may have affected his son's health, as John suffered a prolonged bout of rheumatic fever at the age of seven. He claimed that the illness had initiated him into &#145;the regions of anguish &amp; dolour&#146;, even turning his hair prematurely grey  (<span class="italic">Dunlop Papers</span>, 1.2). Yet although depression dogged Dunlop throughout adult life, his childhood was relatively happy and secure. His father had become respected in Greenock's civic and commercial circles. Holidays were spent at Gairbraid with his well-connected grandparents, who introduced him to local &eacute;lite society. Conversely, up to the age of twelve Dunlop was educated at Greenock day schools, where a range of social backgrounds was represented. This experience, he suggested, fostered the ease that later allowed him to cross class barriers in furthering the temperance cause.<br>
<br>In 1801 Dunlop commenced what was effectively a secondary education by attending classes at Glasgow University. During eight years in the city he lodged at the home of Stevenson Macgill, a Church of Scotland minister and later professor of divinity at the university. Dunlop learned from Macgill's commitment to social outreach, although the scope for activism remained limited while he pursued his studies, ultimately with the aim of practising as a solicitor. After serving a legal apprenticeship in Glasgow, in 1809 he moved briefly to Edinburgh, where he entered a law firm and attended additional university classes. In Edinburgh he met, and married in March 1813, Janet (1791&#150;1861), daughter of Robert Dunmore, of Ballindalloch, merchant and cotton spinner, and his wife, Janet (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Napier). They had nine children, four of whom survived adolescence.<br>
<br>Greenock remained Dunlop's home until 1838. He followed his father's example in local affairs, playing a leading role in founding the town's chamber of commerce in 1813. As his religiosity intensified he also became active in sabbath education, taking a keen interest in the development of Greenock free school. Indeed, from 1815 he kept a private journal that recorded his &#145;spiritual condition and progress (if any) in the divine life&#146; and expressed profound dissatisfaction with his existing lifestyle  (<span class="italic">Dunlop Papers</span>, 1.50). Dunlop's restlessness and introspection were partly triggered by his father's bankruptcy; injudicious investment in the Rothesay Spinning Company had drained Alexander's resources and threatened John's inheritance. The family crisis had been overcome by 1815 and Alexander was eventually restored to solvency by a legacy of &pound;18,000 from a rich uncle. However, the episode made John's outlook more austere, and he was set in the direction that led him to advocate sobriety as the key to moral regeneration.<br>
<br>By the 1820s alcohol consumption was booming in Scotland's industrial centres and the press and philanthropic agencies were emphasizing its corrosive impact on national well-being. As Dunlop told a House of Commons select committee in 1834, his personal epiphany came during a European visit in 1828: &#145;I became satisfied that the superiority of our religious and civil institutions [over the French] was evaded and neutralized by the intemperance of our inhabitants&#146;  (&#145;Select committee on drunkenness&#146;, 511). Already aware of the consciousness-raising work of the American temperance movement, in 1829 Dunlop inaugurated pioneering Scottish societies in Greenock and Maryhill, a developing community near Gairbraid. He began to publish and lecture on the benefits of associational activism, contributing much of his own money to the fledgeling campaign. His energy attracted influential supporters, notably the self-made Glasgow publisher William Collins senior. In 1829 the two men established the Glasgow and West of Scotland Temperance Society, which was soon renamed the Scottish Temperance Society to reflect its expanding sphere of operations.<br>
<br>Buoyed by the movement's success, from 1833 Dunlop devoted himself to working full-time as a temperance propagandist. His financial position was secured in 1836 when the Gairbraid estate and its revenues finally came into his possession. Two years later he left Greenock and settled in London, a more central base for making Britain-wide connections and alliances. He had earlier broken with Collins over conflicting views about the precise definition of &#145;temperance&#146;, although the clash of determined personalities was also a factor in their incompatibility. Dunlop was increasingly attracted to the movement's total-abstention wing, strongly influenced by English nonconformists and altogether more radical than the &#145;moderation&#146; message of the Scots. In the meantime his writing had achieved some recognition, especially his critique of Britain's ingrained drinking customs, <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Artificial and Compulsory Drink Usage</span>, first published in 1833. A mixture of anthropological inquiry, moral homily, and self-help exhortation, the book ran to several editions.<br>
<br>As early as 1830 Dunlop was described as &#145;the Father of Temperance Societies in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Temperance Reformation</span>, 20). His white-bearded, patriarchal appearance helped to consolidate the image, and after leaving Scotland he was known generally as the father of societies across the British Isles. His educated, gentrified background added gravitas to a movement with a large working-class following, and individual organizations often asked him to act as their president or chairman. As Dunlop aged he was regarded as a venerable link with the pioneering days; however, his reluctance to support the instant solution of prohibition marginalized him among the new generation of activists. Dunlop believed that the vital first step was to eradicate bad habits through education, social improvement, and positive example; this would in turn foster a climate favourable to legislative change. His diffidence as a public speaker further muted his impact on a movement noted for charismatic platform performers. Following a family visit his distant cousin, Jane Carlyle, acknowledged his awkwardness: &#145;Pity with so many genuine things to articulate, he should have so defective a gift of articulation!&#146;  (Fielding and Sorensen, 129).<br>
<br>A Liberal in politics, at one point Dunlop was approached by his half-brother, Alexander, to stand for parliament. Nothing came of the suggestion, but from the 1840s Dunlop took up a range of progressive causes, including housing for the poor, sanitary improvement, the shorter working week, and electoral reform. Such interests tied in with his broader aim of creating the appropriate environment for achieving the temperance reformation. He also welcomed women as activists, seeing their involvement in temperance work as evidence of the movement's inclusiveness. Although he returned regularly to Scotland, Dunlop was criticized for being an absentee landlord at Gairbraid, where he apparently did not fulfil promises to improve the estate. However, money was in short supply during his later years and he lived fairly frugally.<br>
<br>From 1859 Dunlop's health started to fail and he withdrew from public life. He died at 17 Priory Road, Kilburn, London, on 12 December 1868, and was buried at Paddington old cemetery. During the nineteenth century his memory was kept alive by temperance campaigners, keen to contrast the British movement's modest beginnings with the phenomenon it later became, and in 1905 a memorial to him was unveiled at Paddington cemetery. The past also legitimized the present, and Dunlop was lauded as the first in a pantheon of enlightened, altruistic heroes. Whatever the complex reality behind his reputation, there can be no doubt that Dunlop's mission to disseminate the advantages of an alternative, alcohol-free culture made him a pivotal figure in the temperance take-off from 1829.<br>
