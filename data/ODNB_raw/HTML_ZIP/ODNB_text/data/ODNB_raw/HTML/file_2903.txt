<span class="headword">Boreman,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1675), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of William Boreman (<i>c</i>.1564&#150;1646) of East Greenwich, a servant in the royal household under Elizabeth, James I, and Charles I, and probably of his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. after 1646). The date and place of his birth are unknown, but he had at least four sisters and three brothers, one of whom, Sir William Boreman (<i>c</i>.1614&#150;1686), was clerk of the greencloth to Charles II. Robert Boreman was educated at Westminster School; he matriculated as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, in Michaelmas 1627. He was elected scholar in 1628, and received the degrees of BA in 1632, MA in 1635, and BD in 1643. In 1633 he was elected fellow of Trinity College, was a tutor 1636&#150;41, and for some time college lecturer in Hebrew. He was ordained priest at Peterborough on 18 February 1638.<br>
<br>Boreman was ejected from his fellowship by the parliamentary visitors, but seems to have remained in the vicinity of Cambridge during the 1650s. Whether he held any living is unknown. At this period he published several polemical tracts on topical issues, defending tithes in <span class="italic">The Country-Mans Catechisme</span> (1652), and the necessity of a university-educated ministry in <span class="italic"><i>Paideia-thriambos</i>: the Triumph of Learning over Ignorance</span> (1653). The latter work had originally been delivered at Swavesey, near Cambridge, where his opponents, said Boreman, yielded to his arguments &#145;with thankfull acknowledgments&#146;  (sig. A4<i>r</i>). Also with political overtones was his warmly eulogistic funeral sermon for the ejected master of Trinity College, Thomas Comber, published as <span class="italic">The Triumph of Faith over Death</span> (1654). <span class="italic">A Mirrour of Mercy and Judgement</span> (1655) recounts the repentance and death of Freeman Sondes, a young man condemned to execution for the murder of his elder brother, to whom Boreman had ministered while on a visit to Kent.<br>
<br>In 1660 Boreman was restored to his fellowship and created DD by royal mandate. On 15 October in that year he was admitted to the rectory of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, a living to which he was apparently again admitted on 31 July 1662. Further tracts and sermons published by Boreman after the Restoration include <span class="italic"><i>Autokatakritos</i>, or, Hypocrisie Unvail'd</span> (1662), an attack on Richard Baxter, whom he notoriously accused of having slain &#145;a man with your own hand in cold blood&#146;  (15). Boreman claimed that his &#145;honest censures&#146; were sincerely intended for Baxter's good, but Baxter, who was pursued by the accusation for many years, attributed the work rather to Boreman's ambition for preferment  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, <span class="italic">Calendar</span>, 2.28, 26).<br>
<br>Preferment did follow, and on 18 November 1663 Boreman was appointed rector of the crown living of St Giles-in-the-Fields, Westminster, which he held until his death, having resigned the rectory of Blisworth. As rector of St Giles he knew Pepys, who heard him give &#145;an account of two papists, women, lately converted&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 8.99); and his parishioners were to include Richard Baxter, and Alice, Duchess Dudley, whose funeral sermon he published as <span class="italic">A Mirrour of Christianity</span> (1669). Although Boreman showed courage in remaining at work in his parish during the plague of 1665, he was not popular with members of his vestry, and in 1670 brought an unsuccessful case against them in the court of exchequer over the right to elect a churchwarden. On 19 December 1667 he was installed as prebendary of Westminster Abbey. He never married but, according to Anthony Wood, &#145;spent his time in celibacy&#146;  (2.55). Robert Boreman died at Greenwich on 15 November 1675 and was buried there on 18 November. The administration of his estate was granted on 20 December 1675 to his brother Sir William Boreman.<br>
