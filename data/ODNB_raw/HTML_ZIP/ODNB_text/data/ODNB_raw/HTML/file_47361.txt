<span class="headword">Rant,  William</span>  (1603/4&#150;1653), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the second of the five sons of William Rant (1564&#150;1627), a physician of Norwich, and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Edward Ward, of Kirby, Norfolk, was born in Norwich, and attended school there for five years under Matthew Stonham. In 1619 Rant and his younger brother, Thomas, matriculated as pensioners at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, William Rant gaining his MB in 1625 and MD in 1630. On his father's death in 1627, he was bequeathed &#145;all my great books of physicke&#146;, and given a special charge &#145;that he be helpful (to the best of his power) to my sonne Edward in the study of physicke&#146;. Edward (<i>d</i>. 1636) was almost certainly the son of a second marriage; his mother was also provided for in the will. As a reward for this service to his half-brother, Rant received &#145;all Avicen with comment in three great volumes&#146; and other especially prized medical books. In addition, he inherited a house in Needham Street, Norwich, and lands outside the city's St Giles's Gate  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/152, sig. 108).<br>
<br>In 1630 Rant moved to London and built a thriving medical practice. He presented himself for examination at the College of Physicians in 1632; was elected a candidate in the college on 30 September 1633; and became a fellow on 30 September 1634. In the same year, Rant and his brother Thomas purchased a pedigree from the College of Arms during the heraldic visitation of London.<br>
<br>Rant soon became an active and highly respected fellow of the College of Physicians. As a second-generation Caius physician, he was more steeped than most in the traditions of academic medicine. He was admired for his elegant library and for his generous benefactions to the college coffers. In October 1639 he delivered the first Goulstonian lecture in morbid anatomy, a lecture endowed by Theodore Goulston's will of 1632. Around 1640 he married Jane Dingley (<i>d</i>. 1656), third daughter of Sir John Dingley, of Wolverton, Hampshire; they had a son, William (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1642), and a daughter, Jane.<br>
<br>Despite having strong royalist sympathies, which led him to contribute financially to Charles I's cause, Rant faithfully attended college meetings in London throughout the civil war years, from 1642 to 1649, and was crucial in the college's functioning. He was a censor on four occasions, in 1640, 1645, 1647, and 1650, and was still active in the college in 1651, when he volunteered to give the anatomy lecture in place of a delinquent Edmund Smith. Some of Rant's prescriptions, dating from 1652 and 1653, were preserved in the Sloane MSS in the British Library.<br>
<br>Rant was seriously ill in 1653 from what was called a &#145;marasmus&#146;, a general weakening or wasting away of the body, a body which, in Rant's case, was already tall and thin by nature. In his last days, he retired to Thorpe Market, in his native county of Norfolk, where he was reunited with his brother Thomas, who had himself withdrawn from London in disaffection with the Commonwealth. Rant died on 15 September 1653, and was buried in the parish church of Thorpe Market. His death was duly noted by the London obituarist Richard Smyth, who managed to confuse him with another college fellow, John Raven. Three years after Rant's death, on 1 February 1656, Thomas Rant presented the College of Physicians with six Arabic books which had been bequeathed to it by his brother.<br>
