<span class="headword">Baseley,  (Cyril) Godfrey</span>  (1904&#150;1997), <span class="occ">radio broadcaster and writer</span>, was born on 2 October 1904 at The Square, Alvechurch, Worcestershire, the second of the three children of Walter Ernest Baseley, master butcher, and his wife, Mary Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Court. His parents were members of the Society of Friends, and he was sent to Quaker boarding-schools, Sibford in Oxfordshire and Bootham in York. More athletic than academic, he left school without passing matriculation examinations, and worked in the family butchery business.<br>
<br>In adult life Baseley professed no formal religion: at his request there was no religious ceremony at his cremation; but when he married his wife, Bessie Hartwright 
    (always known as Betty; <i>b</i>. 1912/13)
  , on 6 August 1934 it was according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Apart from competitive motorcycling, Baseley's main hobby was amateur dramatics: he studied elocution and drama at night school (where he eventually taught), and was soon playing small parts in the professional theatre in Birmingham. From Birmingham too he began to broadcast with increasing regularity from 1929 until 1939 as actor, narrator, and poetry reader.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War, all BBC contracts were cancelled, and so Baseley found work first in civil defence, then in an aircraft factory, and finally with the Ministry of Information. He travelled the midlands with a loudspeaker van, writing and delivering (and at times improvising, at which he excelled) morale-boosting talks on the theme &#145;Dig for victory&#146;.<br>
<br>Baseley's country background and his knowledge of farming and gardening (in which, though, he had no formal training), together with his resonant baritone voice, led to his being engaged on a full-time BBC staff contract. From 1 May 1943 he was attached to the outside broadcasts department in London; but after three months he willingly returned to Birmingham, where, apart from a brief spell in television in London, he was based for the rest of his professional life.<br>
<br>As a BBC staff producer, Baseley commissioned, or wrote, scripts; he engaged performers, whom he directed at the microphone; he learned how to manage BBC budgets, how to work with technical staff, and (sometimes with difficulty) to comply with the strictures of his superiors. He had enormous flair for invention, and energetically defended his suggested programmes. He was formidable in argument, but fair-minded enough to modify apparently fixed views in the face of persuasive reasoning.<br>
<br>Baseley originated many programmes, mainly on farming and the countryside. At a farmers' advisory council meeting to discuss such broadcasts, one Lincolnshire farmer, Henry Burtt, suggested that what was wanted was &#145;a farming Dick Barton&#146; (<span class="italic">Dick Barton</span> being an immensely popular adventure radio serial in short episodes). At what seemed an absurd suggestion most people present laughed. Baseley did not. He developed the idea, and against initial opposition persuaded the BBC to give <span class="italic">The Archers</span>, as it was called, a week's trial from 29 May 1950. Well received when broadcast in the midland region in 1950, it began regular broadcasts on the national Home Service from 1 January 1951, and became one of the BBC's most successful programmes. It won plaudits and prizes and, for some of its participants&#151;but oddly not for Baseley himself&#151;national honours. For more than twenty-one years it became almost an obsession: he believed it to have social significance above mere entertainment.<br>
<br>Fearing that BBC plans in the document <span class="italic">Broadcasting in the Seventies</span> might threaten the programme, Baseley published in 1971 <span class="italic">&#145;The Archers&#146;: a Slice of my Life</span>. Ten of its twelve chapters recounted the origin and growth of the programme and his part in it. In 1972 he was, without warning and for debatable reasons, dismissed by letter. He was to have no further contact with the programme. He turned to lecturing and writing, producing several books on country themes. He made no great fortune but, through an otherwise quiet retirement, his name continued to be linked with <span class="italic">The Archers</span>.<br>
<br>Not always an easy man to work with, Baseley could be overbearing, blunt, and bluff. In private, though, as host, husband, and father, he was genial and surprisingly benign. He relished the fact that he was known by the first syllable of his second name (he never used his first name); and the title &#145;creator&#146; pleased him. On his death certificate he is described as &#145;Broadcaster and Writer. Creator of &#147;The Archers&#148; (retired)&#146;.<br>
<br>Baseley was undeniably the programme's prime mover, advocate, defender, and apologist. Undoubtedly he depended on the contribution of the talented writers, actors, directors, and technicians who worked under his editorial control. Yet without Baseley <span class="italic">The Archers</span> would almost certainly never have existed. He died on 2 February 1997 at the Princess of Wales Community Hospital, Bromsgrove, and his remains were afterwards cremated.<br>
