<span class="headword">Pennethorne, Sir  James</span>  (1801&#150;1871), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 4 June 1801 in Worcester, the third of the seven children of Thomas Pennethorne (1762&#150;1843), hop merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Salt (<i>d</i>. 1849), who ran a school. The architect <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21870/', "John Pennethorne")</script> was his younger brother. He grew up in Worcester, and was educated in Dr Simpson's academy there, but in 1820 he took the place of his elder brother Thomas (1798&#150;1819) as a clerk in the London office of the architect John Nash, whose second wife was his second cousin; the legend that he was an illegitimate son of the prince of Wales (later King George IV) by Mrs Nash cannot be substantiated.<h2>
<a name="Earlytrainingandtravelabroad"></a>Early training and travel abroad</h2>Nash's influence was crucial in shaping Pennethorne's career. It was Nash who arranged for him to be taught drawing by Augustus Charles Pugin in 1821&#150;3, and he was involved in the preparation of the second volume of Pugin's <span class="italic">Specimens of Gothic Architecture</span> (1823). He also attended the Royal Academy Schools, and it was in Nash's magnificent new house at 14 Regent Street that he prepared his first architectural design, for a neo-classical monument to the battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1824 but never constructed. In October 1824 Pennethorne embarked on two years of foreign travel and study, financed by Nash and clearly intended to establish him as his successor. Most of the time was spent in Rome, where he carried out an intensive study of classical and Renaissance buildings, culminating in the preparation of two accomplished but fanciful perspective drawings of the restoration of the Roman forum, the second of which led in April 1826 to his election as a member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He visited and illustrated the Greek temples of southern Italy and Sicily in the summer of 1826, and he also spent some time in Paris in the office of Augustus Pugin's brother-in-law Louis Lafitte before returning to Britain at the end of that year.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandmarriage"></a>Early career and marriage</h2>Pennethorne corresponded regularly with Nash while abroad, and on his return he resumed his position in the older architect's office, becoming his chief assistant in 1828. In this capacity he supervised the last of the metropolitan improvements designed, under an act of parliament of 1826, to link the newly created Regent Street to Trafalgar Square and the Strand: notably Carlton House Terrace, the development of a block of crown property at the western end of the Strand, and the remodelling of St James's Park on picturesque lines. He was involved in the construction, and perhaps also to some extent in the internal design, of Nash's new state rooms at Buckingham Palace, and in 1830, when Nash retired to the Isle of Wight, he took charge of his London office. Here the quantity of work fell off drastically after the death of George IV and Nash's dismissal from his official appointments by the new whig government, and when Pennethorne took over full control in March 1834, a year before Nash's death, little remained beyond repairs and minor building work on the crown estate in London. One of the works in hand was the completion of Park Village West, one of Nash's speculations to the north-east of Regent's Park, and here Pennethorne supervised the building&#151;and may have been involved in the design&#151;of some of the houses. On 8 April 1834 he married Frances (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1865), daughter of Deane John Parker, a Canterbury banker whose elder brother Henry, a tax official&#151;the original &#145;Nosey Parker&#146;, according to family legend&#151;had married Nash's sister-in-law Grace Bradley; the first of their eight children, Deane Parker Pennethorne, was born in 1835. Pennethorne moved out of 14 Regent Street when it was sold by Nash in 1834, and established his office first in Duke Street and then in Bury Street, St James's, before moving to Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, where he was living in 1839.<h2>
<a name="Independentpractice"></a>Independent practice</h2>Pennethorne's independent career got off to a very slow start. His first building, delegated to him by Nash, was Crockford's Bazaar at 10 St James's Street (1831&#150;2; subsequently remodelled), and during the rest of the 1830s he designed only a handful of country houses&#151;notably Swithland Hall, Leicestershire (1834), and the rebuilding of Dillington House, Somerset (<i>c</i>.1837)&#151;and two London churches: Christ Church, Albany Street (1836&#150;7), an austere neo-classical building of some distinction, and Holy Trinity, Gray's Inn Road (1827&#150;8; dem.). But he failed to win any of the competitions he entered, and, despite being recommended by Nash to the commissioners of woods and forests in 1834, he gained no official work until 1839, when he was appointed architect and surveyor to the commissioners for a new phase of metropolitan improvements designed to drive new streets through slum areas in or near the heart of London; the appointment was held jointly with Thomas Chawner, who retired in 1845. The most important of the new streets were New Oxford Street, cutting through the centre of the notorious St Giles Rookery, and Commercial Street, designed to divert traffic to and from the London docks away from the City and through the slums of Whitechapel. Though conceived in a spacious manner which owed much to Nash, they and the two other new streets (Cranbourn Street and Endell Street) were drastically reduced in scale in 1840 as a result of political pressure and financial difficulties, and, as carried out in 1843&#150;7, they made less of an impact on London than Pennethorne, who was solely responsible for their design, had intended. Meanwhile in 1841 he and Chawner were entrusted by the commissioners with the design of Victoria Park, the first park in the East End of London and the first park in any English city to be laid out with public funds for the benefit of the working classes. Here too there were savage cuts in funding before the park was completed in 1847, to Pennethorne's revised but still effective designs of 1845. A similar process occurred at Battersea Park, on the south bank of the River Thames, first designed by Pennethorne in 1845, but revised and reduced in scale in 1853&#150;4 and not completed until 1863. Pennethorne's plans of 1851 for a third park, to be named Albert Park, in north London, never left the drawing board, and in 1855 responsibility for both new streets and parks passed from the government to the newly constituted Metropolitan Board of Works.<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>For most of the 1840s Pennethorne's professional life was taken up with metropolitan improvements and the surveyorship of the crown estate in London, to which he was jointly appointed with Chawner in 1840. He took over as sole surveyor of the estate in 1845 and went on to redesign the Quadrant in Regent Street following the removal of Nash's arcade in 1848 and to lay out the street now called Buckingham Gate to the south of Buckingham Palace in 1853&#150;8; he also supervised the realignment of the approaches to Windsor Castle in 1846&#150;52. His official appointments brought him an office at 7 Whitehall Yard and a steady income which enabled him to settle in some comfort with his growing family at Elms Court, Highgate Hill, and when Chawner retired at the end of 1845 he gave up what remained of his private practice to work full-time for the government. He now began to be employed by successive first commissioners of woods and forests (from 1851 first commissioners of works) to design public and government buildings for which a competition was not deemed necessary, starting in 1846&#150;51 with the Museum of Practical Geology in Piccadilly, a handsome structure (since demolished) with fa&ccedil;ades in the Italian Renaissance manner and an ambitious iron and glass roof lighting the main display area. The massive and austere Public Record Office in Chancery Lane followed in 1851&#150;70, its Gothic exterior hiding a rigorously utilitarian fireproof interior (the west wing was built to the designs of Sir John Taylor in 1891&#150;6), and in 1852&#150;6 Pennethorne designed a new west wing at Somerset House for the Inland Revenue, externally echoing the main building by Sir William Chambers. He also added a new south range, including a lavishly decorated ballroom and supper room, to Buckingham Palace in 1852&#150;6, and in 1854&#150;7 new offices for the duchy of Cornwall were built to his designs at the eastern end of the newly opened Buckingham Gate, facing the palace.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>Pennethorne's later career is littered with the debris of abandoned projects for public buildings in London. In 1853 he was entrusted by the then first commissioner of works, Sir William Molesworth, with the design of a new block of government offices, including a new Foreign Office, on the western side of Whitehall, but in 1855 Molesworth was replaced by Sir Benjamin Hall, who abandoned Pennethorne's plans and announced a competition which eventually led, after many vicissitudes&#151;including the temporary reinstatement of Pennethorne in 1857&#151;to the erection of the present Foreign Office to the designs of Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862&#150;73. Designs for a new War Office in Pall Mall, conceived in 1856, also fell victim to Hall, and a succession of projects for enlarging the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, the first of them dating from 1850, resulted only in the construction in 1860&#150;61 of a new picture gallery which was demolished when the present main staircase was built to Sir John Taylor's designs in 1885. Elaborate designs for the layout of the South Kensington estate owned by the commissioners of the Great Exhibition also remained stillborn, and Pennethorne's only tangible contribution to the development of this district was the erection in 1856 of a temporary and short-lived lecture-room for the South Kensington Museum.<br>
<br>Pennethorne's ill-defined and ambiguous role as government architect was undermined by a series of reforms to the office of works carried out by Sir Benjamin Hall in 1856, and his official career was only rescued after he appealed directly to the Treasury, to which the office was subordinate. But, despite being viciously attacked in Beresford Hope's <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, he was awarded a special gold medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1857 (for the completion of Somerset House), and when Hall stepped down as first commissioner of works after the fall of Palmerston's government in 1858 he recovered something of his former status in the office. Hall's successor, Lord John Manners, employed him to design the staff college at Camberley, Surrey (1859&#150;61), in a plain classical style, and, as a result of a Treasury inquiry in the same year, he was given an annual salary of &pound;1500 for &#145;general services&#146;, in addition to his existing salary of &pound;850 as surveyor to the crown estate and the normal percentage fees for any new buildings he might be asked to design. His last major commissions were the completion of the Public Record Office, the internal remodelling of Marlborough House and the building of a new stable block there for the prince of Wales (1860&#150;63), and, most important, the Senate House for the University of London (1867&#150;70), an impressive and richly decorated classical building erected on ground to the north of Burlington House, acquired by the government on his recommendation in 1854 and for which he made several abortive proposals.<br>
<br>Pennethorne's post as &#145;salaried architect and surveyor&#146; to the government was abolished following a further reorganization of the office of works by Gladstone's first commissioner of works, A. H. Layard, and he retired on 30 June 1870. He was given a royal gold medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1865 and a knighthood in November 1870. His former assistant Arthur Cates, who succeeded him as surveyor to the crown estate in London, called him &#145;[a] man of retired and studious habits, engrossed in the duties of his office, and mixing but little with society&#146;  (Cates, 60). His careful and refined style of classical architecture was not to the taste of the younger generation in the 1870s, and his immediate influence was slight: none of his pupils or assistants made a major impact on the late Victorian architectural world. His career was in some respects a frustrating one, plagued as it was by political interference and perhaps also by deep-seated failure to escape fully from the shadow of his mentor, John Nash. But Pennethorne's long-term legacy was greater than the relatively modest tally of his buildings might suggest. His former detractor, Beresford Hope, told the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1865 that he was responsible &#145;in no small degree [for] the revival of art-conscience on the part of our rulers&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Transactions</span>, 1864&#150;5, 1). He was one of the most accomplished classical architects of his age and, as a designer of new streets and parks, he played a crucial part in the shaping of mid-Victorian London.<br>
<br>Pennethorne moved to Worcester Park House, Long Ditton, Malden, Surrey, in 1865, and it was here that he died, from a heart condition, on 1 September 1871. He was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
