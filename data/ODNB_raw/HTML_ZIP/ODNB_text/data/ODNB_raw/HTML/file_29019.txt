<span class="headword">Wells,  William</span>  (1818&#150;1889), <span class="occ">agriculturist and politician</span>, was born on 15 March 1818, the eldest son of Captain William Wells RN, of Holme, Huntingdonshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22832/', "John Joshua Proby, first earl of Carysfort")</script>. After being educated at Harrow School he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 16 June 1836 and graduated BA (1839) and MA (1842). He then entered the army, holding a commission in the 1st Life Guards.<br>
<br>In 1826 Wells inherited an estate of 8000 acres in the fens. He is chiefly remembered for his efforts as a practical agriculturist to improve and develop this area, and especially for the draining of Whittlesea Mere. This was a shallow sheet of stagnant water, a little more than 1000 acres in extent, surrounded by another 2000 acres of bog and marsh. The drainage of the mere was begun by Wells in 1851. In the following year, as a result of heavy rain, the mere flooded on 12 November. All the water was, however, discharged a second time with the help of an &#145;Appold&#146; centrifugal pump, which Wells was one of the first to utilize for land drainage. By the autumn of 1853 the bed of the mere was under cultivation. The surrounding peatland proved more intractable, however, and it was found necessary to go through a process of warping, or overlaying with fertile soil. This work had hardly begun when Wells contributed his account of the draining operations to the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society</span>, in 1860. On 7 December 1854 Wells married Louisa, daughter of Francis Wemyss-Charteris-Douglas, seventh earl of Wemyss.<br>
<br>Wells also inherited the Redleaf estate in Kent from his great-uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62873/', "William Wells (1768&#150;1847)")</script> in 1847. He rebuilt Holmewood House in 1874 to designs by William Young, who later also altered Gosford for Wells's brother-in-law, the tenth earl of Wemyss, and designed the War Office in Whitehall in 1898. He continued his great-uncle's picture collecting and was a friend of Sir Edwin Landseer, of whom he was a sporting companion. Like his brother-in-law Lord Wemyss he was a champion rifle shot and active in the volunteer movement. He was an original member of the National Rifle Association council (1860) and was a captain of the English eight (1868&#150;77). He had a rifle range at Redleaf and commanded the 23rd (Kent) volunteer rifles based at Penshurst.<br>
<br>The operations at Whittlesey were brought to an end about 1866, after fifteen years of incessant labour. Much of the cultivation of the reclaimed land, and most of that of the two home farms reserved by Wells, was performed by means of steam power. With the object of encouraging the intelligent use of steam for agricultural purposes, Wells offered annual prizes, beginning in 1864, at the meetings of the Peterborough Agricultural Society; these were awarded to the drivers of agricultural portable steam engines, for skill and care in the management of the machines, coupled with a clear record with regard to accidents.<br>
<br>Wells became a member of council of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1861. In December 1862 he was a member of the chemical committee, of which he was elected chairman in 1866. This post he continued to hold up to the time of his death. He was president of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1880, and of the Shire Horse Society in 1885. He represented Beverley in parliament from 1852 to 1857, and Peterborough from 1868 to 1874. He was justice of the peace for Kent and Huntingdonshire, and high sheriff of the latter county in 1876.<br>
<br>Wells died at his London residence, 12 North Audley Street, Grosvenor Square, on 1 May 1889, and was buried at Holme, Huntingdonshire, on 6 May. He had no sons and was succeeded by his brother, Grenville Granville Wells.<br>
