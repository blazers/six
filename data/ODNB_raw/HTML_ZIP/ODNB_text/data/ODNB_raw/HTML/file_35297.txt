<span class="headword">O'Higgins,  Kevin Christopher</span>  (1892&#150;1927), <span class="occ">politician and social reformer</span>, was born on 7 June 1892 in the Dispensary House, Stradbally, Queen's county, fourth son and fourth of the sixteen children of Thomas Francis Higgins (<i>d</i>. 1923), medical officer for the Athy union and county coroner, and his wife, Anne or Annie (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Timothy Daniel Sullivan (poet, patriot, MP, and lord mayor of Dublin), and sister of the wife of Timothy Michael Healy KC, first governor-general of the Irish Free State. His brothers included the medical officer, army officer, and politician in Ireland <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65855/', "Thomas O'Higgins (1889&#150;1953)")</script>. The family home soon became Woodlands, near Stradbally, and that is where Kevin O'Higgins grew up, attending the local convent school, then the Christian Brothers' school, Maryborough, Clongowes Wood College, and St Mary's College, Knockbeg, Carlow. With a view to entering the priesthood he then attended St Patrick's College, Maynooth, but had to move to Carlow seminary, in 1911, for breaking the non-smoking rules. Being further unwilling to accept the restricted seminary lifestyle, he abandoned notions of a vocation. He was briefly apprenticed to Maurice Healy, a Cork solicitor and brother of Timothy, while at the same time resuming his BA studies, in legal and political sciences&#151;this time at University College, Dublin. Uninspired by his subject and increasingly distracted by his practical political activities, he obtained only a pass BA in 1915 and a similar LLB in 1919.<br>
<br>Already O'Higgins had committed himself to the cause of nationalist separatism by joining the Irish Volunteers in 1915, becoming captain of the Stradbally company, Carlow brigade, in 1917, and being imprisoned for five months in 1918 in Mountjoy gaol and Belfast internment camp. In the general election of December 1918 he was elected Sinn F&eacute;in MP for Queen's county. Efficient and forceful, he soon gained recognition in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as it asserted itself as an alternative government at a time also of increasing armed resistance to London rule. He became assistant minister for local government in January 1919, and raised the republican loan in his constituency (a remarkable &pound;10,000). When his minister, W. T. Cosgrave, was arrested in 1920, he became substitute minister, an appointment confirmed by the D&aacute;il that June. In the May 1921 general election he was returned for the Laois&#150;Offaly constituency unopposed, and that August he was again appointed assistant minister for local government.<br>
<br>When peace negotiations were arranged for October 1921 between British and Irish representatives, O'Higgins declined the position of secretary to the Irish delegation in order to marry Bridget Mary (1898&#150;1961), schoolteacher daughter of Andrew Cole, of Drumlish, co. Longford. He approved the settlement, however, and was one of the ablest speakers in its favour in the D&aacute;il, arguing that &#145;it represents such a broad measure of liberty for the Irish people and it acknowledges such a large proportion of its rights, you are not entitled to reject it without being able to show them [the plain people of Ireland] that you have a reasonable prospect of achieving more&#146;  (D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, 45). In January 1922 he became minister for economic affairs in Arthur Griffith's first Free State government and he held a similar position in the provisional government chaired by Michael Collins. In the election of that year he was returned, the second of four deputies, for the same Laois&#150;Offaly constituency, and after the tragic deaths of both Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins that August, he became minister for home affairs and vice-president of the executive council. The home affairs ministry was changed to the ministry of justice in 1924, and to that responsibility he added external affairs in the summer of 1927. After transferring to co. Dublin for the election of 1923 he had headed the poll, on behalf of Cumann na nGaedheal, and this he repeated in the June elections of 1927. He had grown in these few years to be the outstanding political figure of his day, the main prop of the government and its principal international spokesman.<br>
<br>It was to O'Higgins that the task fell of steering through the founding constitution of the state, modified, unacceptably to some, from its original form by the requirements of the 1921 treaty, but still a humane, liberal, and democratic document. He regretted only that those who retained reservations about it would not join in the democratic struggle to build upon it to reach the goal sought by all. His description of the early provisional governments as &#145;eight young men in the City Hall standing amidst the ruins of one administration, with the foundations of another not yet laid, and with wild men screaming through the keyhole&#146;  (White, 84) remains a vivid example of his style. After years of civil strife, and physical and passive resistance to the institutions of the British state, it fell now to him to restore the rule of law and rebuild the state along national lines. For his work he is recognized as the father of the unarmed Garda Siochana, the new national police force established in 1922. It was he who most prominently epitomized the determination of the government during the civil war of 1922&#150;23, at the cost of the life of his father, murdered in retaliation on 11 February 1923. And it was O'Higgins, too, who took the lead in confronting and confounding those mutinous elements in the swollen state army as the government sought to return it to peacetime numbers in 1924. At the Imperial Conference of 1926, perhaps the most significant of such meetings, he had contributed vitally to the debates which were to complete the transformation of an empire of domination into a Commonwealth of partners.<br>
<br>It is as a reformer of the powerful Irish drink trade, with three <span class="roman">Liquor Acts</span> to his credit, and as a visionary for an Ireland reunited by consent, that O'Higgins will also be remembered. Strong, intelligent, of the most rigorous integrity, he strove to banish the evils that had blighted his country and to make of his countrymen proud upholders of the best in the Irish tradition. Shy and private, with a perhaps misleadingly tough exterior, he had a self-deprecating humour that expressed itself even at the most trying of moments. When asked by a British captor how he would like five or six bullets in his head, he is said to have replied that he would not particularly mind the last four or five  (Foxall, 2 June 1963); even at the end, when close to death, when those around tried to offer encouragement, he had whispered &#145;There is no hope. I should be dead by now, only I have always been a bit of a diehard&#146;  (<span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>).<br>
<br>O'Higgins had by then endured many hardships. Despite his good marriage, he had belatedly encountered and fallen in love with Hazel, Lady Lavery, wife of the distinguished painter, to whom he could only regret in his many letters that he had met her too late. He retained the joy in the birth and vitality of his two daughters, Maeve (<i>b</i>. June 1923) and Una (<i>b</i>. January 1927); but in between, his son, Finbarr Gerald, born in November 1924, had lived only twelve days. His hope for his girls was that they would grow up in an Ireland &#145;where all the creases in Irish life will have been ironed out. &hellip; Taxation will be halved, unemployment abolished, and Irish-speaking Orangemen will be boasting about Henry Joy McCracken in a Dublin Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Times</span>, 11 July 1927). That he was cut down in his prime, with so little time given to seek such ends, is one explanation for their slow progress. His death, however, was followed by a stringent <span class="roman">Public Safety Act</span> and an <span class="roman">Electoral Amendment Act</span> that finally forced the main opposition party, Fianna F&aacute;il, to enter D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rather than risk political oblivion, and this did much to secure the democratic political institutions that were the object of his political life.<br>
<br>O'Higgins was assassinated on his way to attend mass at Booterstown, near Dublin, on 10 July 1927. His murder on a Sunday morning, just back from projecting his state's interests at a League of Nations naval conference in Geneva, and having considerately dismissed his escort for the short walk to mass, caused particular revulsion. As he lay dying, he forgave his killers, believing that no more blood should be shed in a country that had lost too many of its sons. (He had perforce signed the death warrant of his own best man, Rory O'Connor, during the civil war.) His death should have been instantaneous, but his strong will helped keep him alive for several hours as, having been carried back to his house, he put his affairs in order and took his leave of family and friends. The following day his remains were removed from his dwelling, Dunamase House, Cross Avenue, Booterstown, to the Mansion House, Dublin, where thousands filed past his coffin, which lay in state until 8 p.m. on Tuesday 12th. His funeral took place in the morning of 13 July after a requiem mass at St Andrew's Church, Westland Row. It was a sad and sombre day of national mourning, a state occasion attended by all leading Irish figures and by foreign and Commonwealth representatives, amid tributes from around the world. The funeral cort&egrave;ge stretched for over 3 miles along thronged and silent streets, with ten lorryloads of flowers behind the family wreaths. O'Higgins was buried in the north-west corner of Glasnevin cemetery, in the division known as St Brigid's, in the same grave as his infant son.<br>
