<span class="headword">Lewis <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brereton]</span>,  Alethea</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Eugenia  de Acton]</span>  (1749&#150;1827), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 19 December 1749, at Acton, near Nantwich, Cheshire, the elder surviving child of the Revd Joseph Brereton (1721&#150;1787), Church of England clergyman, and his first wife, whose first name was also Alethea (1727/8&#150;1752). After her mother's death (when she was a little over two years of age) she was sent to live in Suffolk with her maternal grandfather, John Kilderbee, a linen draper at Framlingham. Her father, who was chaplain and librarian to the fourth earl of Dysart, remarried and had another family; at his death in 1787 he left her 5 guineas, but his younger daughters &pound;100 each.<br>
<br>Alethea attended a day school, and in her teens frequented reading circles and began to write, as a pastime and to earn money. As her works show, she read omnivorously. She introduced her close friend Sarah Elmy to George Crabbe, and the couple married; her own engagement to Crabbe's friend William Springal Levett (1752/3&#150;1774) ended with Levett's death in October 1774. She corresponded with Crabbe for several years under the name of Stella; they resumed writing to each other on Sarah Crabbe's death.<br>
<br>On 19 June 1788 Alethea Brereton married Augustus Fowle Lewis (<i>d</i>. 1819), a surgeon who had served a sentence of transportation. She reputedly met him on a stagecoach, and married him without knowing of his criminal record. He seems, however, to have been a good husband. Two months later they emigrated to Philadelphia; but they stayed in America only about a year. On their return they lived briefly in Lancashire, then settled at Preston Hill, Penkridge, Staffordshire, where Augustus Lewis practised surgery and farmed. In 1794 she published her first novel, <span class="italic">Vicissitudes in Genteel Life</span>. She went on to write five more books of which the attribution is unquestionable, while the authorship of five more remains in dispute.<br>
<br>Two doubtful novels, anonymous like Lewis's first, appeared from the Minerva Press in 1795 and 1797. A later title-page claim links them with other novels which may be hers; but they are not mentioned in her next undoubted work. This was <span class="italic">The Microcosm</span> (1801), &#145;by the author of Vicissitudes in Genteel Life&#146;, published by subscription and dedicated to her local member of parliament. Its critical preface claims the novel form as a vehicle for Christian instruction, and situates the author in a tradition of fiction reaching back through Fielding, Richardson, F&eacute;nelon, and Cervantes to Virgil.<br>
<br>In 1803 Alethea Lewis published with Minerva a moral work entitled <span class="italic">Essays on the Art of being Happy</span>. This launched the pseudonym by which she is often known: Eugenia de Acton, a humorous use of her birthplace. (She enjoyed playing with names: she gave three characters in <span class="italic">Vicissitudes</span> her own baptismal name, maiden name, and surname respectively.) The pseudonym recurs on <span class="italic">A Tale without a Title: Give it what you Please</span> (1804), <span class="italic">The Nuns of the Desert, or, The Woodland Witches</span> (1805), and <span class="italic">The Deserted Daughter</span> (1810).<br>
<br>The alternative claimant of the remaining doubtful works (<span class="italic">Things by their Right Names</span>, 1812, <span class="italic">Rhoda</span>, 1816, and <span class="italic">Isabella</span>, 1823) is Frances Margaretta Jacson, whose authorship was asserted both by her own family and by Maria Edgeworth. (Edgeworth mentions her as author of <span class="italic">Rhoda</span>; title-pages link <span class="italic">Rhoda</span> to the other novels claimed for both Jacson and Lewis.) Similarities of purpose and technique between the two groups are striking, but cannot be regarded as conclusive. Jane Austen's <span class="italic">Emma</span> was compared unfavourably with <span class="italic">Rhoda</span> by several readers at the time.<br>
<br>Whether or not the disputed titles are credited to Alethea Lewis, she is an interesting, even quirky writer. Her central plot lines (suffering virtue eventually rewarded) and her earnest Christian intent are conventional enough; but with these qualities go self-conscious and critical addresses to the reader, displays of erudition, use of incidents from her own life, play with titles and genres, and a vein of the fantastical. Alethea Lewis died in 1827, and was buried on 12 November 1827 in Penkridge, Staffordshire.<br>
