<span class="headword">O'Brien,  James Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1874), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Ossory, Ferns, and Leighlin</span>, born at New Ross, co. Wexford, on 27 September 1792, was the son of Michael Burke O'Brien (<i>d</i>. 1826), a corporation officer with the title of deputy sovereign of New Ross, and Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Kough. His father, who came originally from co. Clare, was descended, although he himself became a protestant, from a Roman Catholic branch of the O'Brien family, which had been deprived of its property by the penal laws. James was educated at the endowed school at New Ross, which was supported by the corporation, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner in November 1810. A portion of the cost of his education was defrayed by the borough of New Ross; in September 1826 he refunded the amount&#151;&pound;116&#151;and was voted the freedom of the borough and a gold box. O'Brien obtained a scholarship at Trinity College in 1813 and graduated BA with gold medal in 1815. He was especially distinguished in mathematics, and in 1820 obtained a fellowship; having taken holy orders, he was created DD in 1831. He was one of the six Dublin University preachers from 1828 to 1842, and became Archbishop King's lecturer in 1833, when the divinity school in the university was thoroughly reorganized.<br>
<br>O'Brien maintained strongly evangelical views throughout his life. He was well read in the works of the reformers and their opponents, and in those of Bishop Butler and the deists. His university sermons of 1829 and 1830 on the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith became, when published in 1833, a standard work. He lectured on &#145;The evidences of religion, with a special reference to sceptical and infidel attempts to invalidate them, and the Socinian controversy&#146;. In 1836 he married Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1906), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21864/', "Edward Pennefather")</script>, lord chief justice of Ireland. They had eight sons and five daughters. O'Brien resigned his fellowship in the same year, and became vicar of Clonderhorka, Raphoe, but moved in 1837 to the vicarage of Arboe, co. Tyrone, which he held until 1841. On 9 November 1841 he was nominated dean of Cork, and instituted on 5 January 1842. On 9 March in the same year he was made bishop of the united dioceses of Ossory, Ferns, and Leighlin.<br>
<br>O'Brien was a daily worshipper in his cathedral. He seldom preached or spoke except at the meetings of the Church Education Society (of which he was an active champion); the society was the Church of Ireland's response to the national schools, of which he was correspondingly critical. Naturally opposed to the Oxford Movement, he did what he could to stem its advance in sermons and writings between 1840 and 1850, singling out Newman for especial disparagement. In 1850 appeared his <span class="italic">Tractarianism: its Present State, and the Only Safeguard Against it</span>. <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> he described as &#145;shifting, evasive, and disingenuous&#146;  (Carroll, 16). To the disestablishment of the Irish church O'Brien opposed a well-sustained resistance, and Archbishop Trench of Dublin acknowledged the value of his advice in the course of the struggle. When disestablishment came, O'Brien helped to reorganize the church, and cautioned his evangelical friends in their efforts to revise the prayer book in accordance with their own principles&#151;for instance, where infant baptism was concerned&#151;fearing &#145;lest, in raising bulwarks against ritualism and popery, the Church itself should be narrowed&#146;  (Warren, 21).<br>
<br>O'Brien's chief work, <span class="italic">An Attempt to Explain the Doctrine of Justification by Faith Only, in Ten Sermons</span> (1833), ran to five editions. His primary and second charges, 1842 and 1845, published in London, and directed in great part against Tractarianism, each went to several editions. In 1833 he attacked Edward Irving's views in <span class="italic">Two Sermons Relating to the Human Nature of our Blessed Lord</span>, which were re-published in 1873 with a <span class="italic">Plea from the Bible and the Bible Alone for the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration</span>. His charge of 1848 (published in 1850) discussed, <i>inter alia</i>, the alliance between church and state.<br>
<br>O'Brien died at 49 Thurloe Square, London, on 12 December 1874, and was buried in the churchyard of St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny, on 19 December. His successor, Dr Robert Gregg, in his primary charge praised O'Brien's &#145;unvarying consistency, calm judgement, and chastened self-restraint&#146;.<br>
