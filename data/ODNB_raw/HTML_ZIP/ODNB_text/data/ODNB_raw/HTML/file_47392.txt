<span class="headword">Dashwood, Sir  Francis</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1658&#150;1724), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the third son of Francis Dashwood (1619&#150;1683), a member of the Saddlers' Company and Turkey merchant, and his wife, Alice (1621&#150;1693/4), daughter of Richard Sleigh of Derbyshire. Francis and his elder brother Samuel (<i>c</i>. 1643&#150;1705) were educated at home before joining their father in his silk business, which they inherited at his death.<br>
<br>Samuel soon rose to power in the City of London, which he represented as MP in 1685&#150;7 and 1690&#150;95. During the 1680s both brothers invested in the Levant, Royal African, and Old East India companies (they held seats on the governing body of the last named company); Samuel was knighted in 1684. Francis was made free of the Vintners' Company in 1680. He married on 13 April 1683 Mary (<i>d</i>. 1694), daughter of John Jennings of Westminster, a marriage which produced a son and two daughters. By the time of the revolution Francis's success in trade had enabled him to accumulate a sizeable fortune, and in 1690 he loaned the government &pound;1000. To Sir Samuel he expressed a wish to obtain a government post, in which he was not successful. He established a residence at Wanstead, Essex, and in 1698 the brothers spent &pound;15,000 on the manor of West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Queen Anne knighted Francis during the feast held for Sir Samuel's inauguration as lord mayor in October 1702.<br>
<br>Dashwood's first involvement in politics came before the general election of 1705, when he was considered as a possible whig candidate for Coventry, standing in partnership with or in place of either of his sons-in-law, Sir Fulwar Skipwith, second baronet, or Sir Orlando Bridgeman. Dashwood, however, imprudently sought to intercede with Lord Brooke, the tory patron, on Skipwith's behalf, and although he then contributed to Bridgeman's electoral expenses, the whigs were defeated at both Coventry and the county polls.<br>
<br>The year 1705 was a turning point in Francis's life. Samuel died, and on 30 May Francis married Mary (1674&#150;1710), daughter of Vere Fane, the fourth earl of Westmorland and lord governor of the Cinque Ports, who brought with her title to the barony of Le Despencer. This union enhanced Dashwood's personal and political standing. It brought him another son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7179/', "Francis Dashwood, eleventh Baron Le Despencer (1708&#150;1781)")</script> and best known as a member of the notorious Hellfire Club, and a daughter, Rachel (<i>d</i>. 1788), who married the politician Sir Robert Austin. In 1706 Dashwood was able to purchase for &pound;15,000 from his nephew George Dashwood, who had inherited it, Sir Samuel's share of the manor of West Wycombe, and having transferred his Wanstead estate to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, he settled his family at West Wycombe. The following year a baronetcy was conferred upon him.<br>
<br>Dashwood finally entered parliament without a contest in 1708 as whig MP for the Cinque Ports town of Winchelsea, where he contributed little beyond voting in 1709 for the naturalization of the &#145;poor Palatines&#146; (German protestants) and in 1710 supporting the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell. He also voted in favour of the merger between the Old and New East India companies. The resulting merger opened up not only the oriental trade, but also that of the West Indies and America, to all English merchants. He had to dig into his purse to hold the contested seat again at the 1710 election, successfully defending accusations of bribery of the electorate. His allegiance wavered at this point, and he was one of those who uncovered the mismanagement of the previous whig government, but he came back into the fold to vote in 1713 against the <span class="roman">French Commerce Bill</span>, which would have affected his trading interests. He did not stand at the election held that year and retired from active political life.<br>
<br>Following the death of his second wife, Dashwood married on 17 June 1712 Mary (<i>d</i>. 1719), the daughter of Major (Charles?) King, who bore him two sons and two daughters. His fourth marriage, on 21 July 1720, to Elizabeth (1666?&#150;1736), daughter of Thomas Windsor, first earl of Plymouth, was childless. About 1720 he bought the manor of Halton in Buckinghamshire, on the improvement of which he spent lavishly, at the same time beautifying his home at West Wycombe. He died at his town house in Hanover Square, Westminster, on 4 November 1724 and was buried at West Wycombe. Despite the expenditure of his latter years, Dashwood's personal estate was valued at over &pound;34,000. The baronetcy passed to his son Francis, then aged fifteen.<br>
