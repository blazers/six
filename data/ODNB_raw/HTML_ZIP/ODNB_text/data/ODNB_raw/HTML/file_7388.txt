</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Deane,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">army and naval officer and regicide</span>, was baptized on 8 July 1610 in the parish church of Guiting Power, a younger son of Edward Deane (<i>d</i>. before 1653) of Temple Guiting, Gloucestershire, and his second wife, Ann Wass (<i>d</i>. 1670). Little is known of his early life. His uncle or great-uncle, Sir Richard Deane, lord mayor of London in 1628&#150;9, was a member of the Skinners' Company, one of the founders of the East India Company, and a member of the Levant, Virginia, and North West Passage companies, and Deane may have begun a mercantile career under his auspices. Though Sir Richard was known as a puritan he gave no help to the merchants who rebelled against impositions during his mayoralty and he received a knighthood from Charles I at the end of his term. There was a Richard Deane at Gray's Inn in 1619&#151;simultaneously with future <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "regicides")</script>&#151;but this was the future general's uncle. Through his mother's family, however, he was related to Cromwell, Hampden, and many future Buckinghamshire parliamentarians. Like George Blake, younger brother of the future general-at-sea, a shipowner called Richard Deane traded out of Plymouth, and had a cargo of deals, ironwork, and timber from G&ouml;teborg, on board the <i>Matthew</i> of Plymouth, enumerated in the Plymouth customs book under the date 25 November 1633. This is probably the same man who in 1637 is mentioned as having bought a French prize at Plymouth and who was probably the future general. (In June 1653 the council of state ordered the import, customs free, of wines, sugar, and tobacco belonging to Major-General Deane, reinforcing the likelihood of a mercantile background.) As both Blake and Deane were trading with northern Europe in timber there is a strong possibility that they were acquainted and that, through George Blake, Deane was already in contact with his brother Robert.<h2>
<a name="Militarycareer16421649"></a>Military career, 1642&#150;1649</h2>On the outbreak of war Deane served in north-west Kent with a group of parliamentarians headed by Captain Willoughby which secured Woolwich Dockyard, capturing seventy-five pieces of ordnance. Willoughby then occupied Gravesend Fort where Deane became a member of the garrison. He was probably at Edgehill on 23 October 1642, possibly at the first battle of Newbury on 27 September 1643. By August 1644 he was comptroller of the ordnance with Essex's army in Cornwall, waiting on and giving advice to his general, who speaks of him as &#145;an honest, judicious, and stout man&#146;. When Essex abruptly quitted the army, leaving it to Major-General Philip Skippon to get out of the difficulty the best way he could, Skippon called a council of war, which rejected his proposal to cut their way through the enemy, and determined rather to treat. The negotiation ended in the army of 6000 men laying down their arms and surrendering their guns, of which there were forty-nine, all of brass. Deane, who seems to have been left by the desertion of his seniors in actual command of the artillery, was one of the twenty officers who formed this council and signed the &#145;attestation&#146; or published report of its proceedings. His involvement in the surrender did him no harm and following parliament's approval for the formation of a siege train for the New Model Army in January 1645 he was again appointed comptroller of the ordnance. He commanded the artillery at Naseby (14 June 1645), where his steady fire broke the force of Rupert's headlong charge. He continued to serve with Fairfax in his conquering march into the west country, and his guns played a particularly important part at the battle of Langport and the capture of Sherborne Castle. At the reduction of Bristol (11 September) his &#145;dexterity, industry, and resolution&#146; were specially commended. He was one of the commissioners to arrange the terms of Ralph Hopton's surrender at Truro (14 March 1646) and afterwards took part in the siege of Oxford, which surrendered, by the king's orders, on 20 June.<br>
<br>On 21 May 1647, at the Temple Church, Deane married Mary, daughter of John Grymesditch of Knottingley in Yorkshire, the witnesses being Colonel Robert Lilburne, afterwards a fellow regicide, and the Leveller Colonel Thomas Rainborowe. Meanwhile, with the end of active fighting, relations between the army and parliament deteriorated. On 28 May 1647 the parliament appointed Cromwell to be lord-general of the forces in Ireland, and Deane to be with him as lieutenant of the artillery. Their scarcely veiled object was to get Cromwell out of the way, and the association of Deane with him suggests that he was now recognized as one of Cromwell's partisans. Cromwell declined the appointment, choosing to remain in England, as did Deane, now promoted to adjutant-general. The quarrel was rapidly coming to a head. On 4 June the control of the king's person was assumed by George Joyce, who brought him to the army. At Newmarket he was waited on by many of the superior officers, Deane among them, who kissed the king's hand. Joyce asserted that what he had done was by Cromwell's order but this Cromwell denied in the most positive and violent manner, and is said on one occasion to have been prevented from doing Joyce &#145;some mischief&#146; only by the interposition of Deane and others  (<span class="italic">Harleian Miscellany</span>, 8.304). Throughout this period Deane was a member of the council of officers and on 23 June 1647 signed the remonstrance of the army to parliament. On 5 July he was one of those nominated to draw up propositions to the king and on 16 July was among the officers negotiating with the agitators, drawn from the soldiery. He was present at the Putney debates, where he took only a small part but was placed on the committee appointed to revise the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> in the light of army resolutions. His stance was that of the less radical element, aligned with Cromwell and Ireton. On the resignation of William Batten in September 1647 Rainborowe was nominated as vice-admiral of the fleet and Deane was immediately given his regiment, much to Rainborowe's annoyance.<br>
<br>When the royalist uprising in 1648 called the army again to the field Deane, in command of a regiment, accompanied Cromwell, first into Wales, where he was actively engaged in the reduction of Pembroke Castle, and afterwards to the north, where in the battle of Preston (17 August) he and Colonel Thomas Pride did good service on the parliamentarian right wing. The army determined to deal with the king. The contribution of Deane's regiment to the remonstrance of the army (20 November 1648) was presumably drawn up by Deane himself, or at any rate in strict accordance with his views; its most important clauses are:<blockquote>That the parliament be desired to take a review of their late declaration and charge against the king, as also to consider his own act in taking the guilt of bloodshed upon himself; and accordingly to proceed against him as an enemy to the kingdom.<br>
<br>That strict inquiry be made after the chief fomenters, actors, and abettors of the late war, especially those who were the chief encouragers and inviters of the Scotch army; and that exemplary justice may be accordingly executed, to the terror of evil-doers and the rejoicing of all honest men.</blockquote>In addition to these, among other matters of detail, was the very practical demand that &#145;speedy supplies should be sent to the army&#146; so as to put an end to &#145;that which is so insufferable for us to take and so intolerable for the people to bear, namely, free quarters&#146;. These demands not being met, the army marched on London, and while Pride was instructed to &#145;purge&#146; the House of Commons, Fairfax wrote (8 December) to the lord mayor and corporation that as the arrears of the assessment due to the army had not been paid as demanded, he had ordered &#145;Colonel Deane and some others to seize the treasuries of Goldsmiths' Hall and Weavers' Hall&#146;. &#145;Two regiments of foot and several troops of horse accordingly took up their quarters in Blackfriars and some at Ludgate and Paul's Church. They likewise secured the treasuries &hellip; and took away from Weavers' Hall above &pound;20,000&#146;  (Rushworth, 2.1356). The proceeding, as Fairfax pointed out to the lord mayor, was the same as &#145;our forces have been ordered to do by the parliament in the several counties of the kingdom where assessments have not been paid&#146;. And in carrying out his orders Deane exercised a stern control over his men; two, newly listed, being found by court-martial guilty of extortion on their own account, were sentenced to &#145;ride the wooden horse for an hour&#146;, and &#145;to run the gantelope through the regiment &hellip; for the example of others who, under colour of being soldiers, care not what knavery they act&#146;  (ibid., 2.1369).<br>
<br>Deane played an active part in the trial and execution of the king in January 1649. On 12 January he was on the committee for planning the king's trial and attended fifteen (or possibly nineteen) of the twenty-three sessions of the high court of justice. On 24 January he was appointed one of the committee to examine the witnesses; on the 27th he stood up in approval of the judgment; on the 29th he was one of the committee of five to consider the time and place of execution; and he was the twenty-first out of the fifty-nine who signed the death warrant. His signature is written in his usual firm, bold hand, and his seal of arms is distinctly impressed, without the least sign of hurry or nervousness [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>].<h2>
<a name="Generalatseaandmajorgeneral16491653"></a>General-at-sea and major-general, 1649&#150;1653</h2>Cromwell had wanted Deane to succeed Batten as vice-admiral in September 1647, and in December 1648 he appears to have discussed with a deeply discontented earl of Warwick the possibility of Deane's replacing him. No action was taken, however, ahead of the first meeting of the council of state on 17 February 1649, and on the 20th it resolved &#145;that the commission making the Earl of Warwick lord high admiral be called in&#146;, and that the command at sea should be given to commissioners. On the 23rd they named Colonel Edward Popham, Colonel Robert Blake, and Deane as the three commissioners &#145;to go to sea this summer, to take the command of the fleet&#146;. This appointment of trusted army officers was unquestionably made chiefly from political motives. In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries military qualifications always took precedence, it being assumed that the commander would take advice on navigational matters from his council of captains.<br>
<br>In the early part of 1649 the generals-at-sea co-operated in forcing Prince Rupert's privateers to leave the channel, but once he was safely cooped up in Kinsale they separated. Deane concentrated on protecting the army dispatched for the reconquest of Ireland. In August he convoyed Cromwell's army from Milford Haven to Dublin. He was then sent back to London with the marquess of Ormond's intercepted correspondence and missed the siege of Drogheda. He was back in time to command the twenty ships which carried food, siege guns, and ammunition for the attack on Wexford. In the later operations the army suffered much from sickness; Deane, writing from Milford Haven on 8 November 1649, reported: &#145;I have, ever since my coming out of Ireland, been troubled with the distemper of that country's disease, which brought me into a fever&#146;. He was still sick on 4 December, when orders were sent to Blake &#145;to go towards Cadiz to seek out Prince Rupert&#146;  (Penn, 1.293).<br>
<br>In 1650 Deane commanded in home waters while Blake and Popham chased Rupert to Portugal. His chief task was to cut off communication between the Netherlands and Scotland but he was unable to prevent Charles II's landing. When Cromwell invaded Scotland, Deane sent a squadron under Rear-Admiral Hall to assist him but he himself only visited Leith briefly on 15 September. During the winter the squadron in the Forth was commanded by Captain Lionel Lane, and Deane did not return until the spring. On 29 March he arrived at Leith, bringing his own regiment and, among other supplies, a number of large flat-bottomed boats for the transport of the troops across the firth. On 6 May he was ordered by Cromwell to take command on shore as major-general of the army, in which capacity he had a prominent part in the operations of the ensuing summer, the pursuit of the Scottish army into England, and the battle of Worcester (3 September 1651).<br>
<br>Deane returned to Scotland as one of eight commissioners appointed to settle civil government and prepare for a union with England in October 1651; from December 1651 he also shared the chief military command in Scotland with Monck and John Lambert. By March 1652 he was left in sole military command, the departure of the other civil commissioners by the end of the following month leaving him effectively to head the civil and financial administration also. He had been working with Lambert to regulate assessments in Scotland since the previous December, and by November 1652 was empowered to authorize all disbursements of revenue in Scotland. He oversaw the implementation of plans formulated by the commissioners, including the establishment of a high court of judicature consisting of four English and three Scottish judges, to replace the abolished Scottish juridical institutions. In June 1652 he was named as one of the commissioners for the regulation of the universities and the ministry. Deane also managed to get the customs duties between England and Scotland at Carlisle and Berwick abolished. As military commander he secured the three remaining royalist garrisons: Brodick Castle on Arran and the Bass Rock, which commanded the navigation of the Forth and the sea approach to Edinburgh, fell in April 1652, while Dunnottar Castle, the &#145;last place in Scotland which displayed the standard of Charles II&#146; and the location of the regalia of Scotland, surrendered to Colonel Thomas Morgan in May  (Firth, xix). In June Deane issued a proclamation to the clan chiefs and inhabitants of the north-west before launching a two-pronged advance intended to subjugate the highlands. He set out for Inveraray where he finally secured from the marquess of Argyll a submission to the English parliament and acceptance of the union in a series of agreements which allowed Argyll to retain much of his standing.<br>
<br>On 26 November 1652 Deane's commission as general-at-sea was ordered to be renewed, as also was Blake's. Popham had died in August of the previous year, and the vacancy was now filled up by the appointment of Monck. The commission was a matter of routine, and there was probably no immediate intention of calling Deane away from Scotland, but on Blake's representation, after the untoward action off Dungeness on 30 November, both Deane and Monck were ordered to join the fleet as soon as possible. Deane received a grant of &pound;400 &#145;for fitting him with necessary accommodation&#146;, and went on board the <i>Triumph</i>, in which Blake already had his flag. Thus closely associated with Blake, he took part in the battle off Portland on 18 February 1653 and in the subsequent pursuit of the Dutch fleet. In this obstinate battle the loss on both sides was very great. As Blake was incapacitated by his wound, the letter of 27 February giving the official account of the battle, though signed by the three generals, was probably written by Deane. He and Monck were now left in command of the fleet, and hoisted their flag on board the <i>Resolution</i>.<br>
<br>To refit and prepare for new battles was the work of the next two months. Deane had arrived from Scotland too late to take part in framing the articles of war (25 December 1652) but a great number of letters written by him about this time testify to the close attention he was paying to all the details which might ensure efficiency. Similarly, proposals for the encouragement of seamen and increases in their wages had been introduced before his return (20 December 1652) but his correspondence in 1653, together with that of his earlier command, shows the watchful care he had for the welfare and interests of those under his orders. &#145;We want&#146;, he wrote on 30 March:<blockquote>an answer to the petition of the officers of the fleet and of the widows of the slain, as we are much importuned by them for some sort of subsistence, and can hardly put them off by telling them it is under consideration.</blockquote>Or again, he wrote that if possible &#145;turning men over from one ship to another should be avoided, for it breedeth trouble and discontent&#146;, but that when necessary they should be paid their wages in money, for &#145;a little bit of paper is soon lost&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 22546, fol. 103). Appeals of this kind were signed sometimes by Deane alone, sometimes by Popham and Deane, sometimes by Blake and Deane, sometimes by Deane and Monck. His signature is, in the same way, equally affixed to many rules and proposals for the better organization of the naval service, then still in a very crude state. Lieutenants are to be capable seamen; none other will be appointed. Inducements must be offered to seamen; they should be entered for continuous service and kept on continuous pay, the same as soldiers (25 March 1653). A surgeon's mate should be borne in ships having complements of 150 men or upwards; the care is too great for one man (30 March 1649). Other letters, referring to proposed changes in the victualling, in the ordnance stores, and to different matters of detail, with an exactness and intelligence widely different from mere routine, suggest previous experience in equipping and manning ships for sea.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1653 Cromwell dissolved the Rump Parliament. Deane probably knew of the impending step, and agreed with it, but the published <span class="italic">Declaration of the Generals at Sea and the Captains under their Command</span> (<i>Resolution</i>, at Spithead, 22 April 1653), in the drawing up of which he had at least a large share, wisely contains no word of approval or disapproval. &#145;We have had&#146;, they say:<blockquote>a very serious consideration of the great changes within this nation &hellip; and we find it set upon our spirits that we are called and entrusted by this nation for the defence of the same against the enemies thereof at sea &hellip; and we are resolved, in the strength of God, unanimously to prosecute the same according to the trust reposed in us.</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>On 30 April the fleet put to sea and, cruising to the northward, was off Aberdeen on 10 May. On the 14th it anchored in Bressa Sound, in Shetland, and after a council sailed again on the 17th. On the 24th the ships were off the mouth of the Scheldt, and they anchored in Solebay on the 31st. They had spent the month vainly looking for the Dutch fleet, but not until the morning of 1 June did they receive any certain intelligence of it. The fleet, increased by successive reinforcements to upwards of a hundred vessels, large and small, immediately put to sea, and sighted the enemy about four o'clock in the afternoon. The next day towards noon the fighting began. As the fleets approached the English appear to have been in three squadrons each in a rough line ahead but the wind dropped and the battle commenced with a cannonade which inflicted great damage on the Dutch. Whether the English intended that to be their final formation is unclear as fleets often turned into a line abreast when they came to close quarters. Later in the day there was heavy fighting which continued until dark, when the two fleets lay by for the night. The battle was renewed the next morning, 3 June; towards afternoon of the second day the Dutch were already retiring when Blake, coming up with a strong reinforcement fresh from the river, completed their rout and put them to the run. The Dutch lost twenty ships sunk or captured, the English none at all. Deane, however, did not live to see this. At the very beginning of the battle a Dutch shot struck him full in the body, cutting it nearly in two. He fell where he stood, and Monck, fearing lest the sailors might be discouraged by the loss, threw a cloak over his mangled remains.<br>
<br>Deane's body was afterwards taken to Greenwich, where it seems to have lain in state, of a sort. The highest honours the government could bestow were granted. A public funeral was ordered. On 24 June the body was taken to Westminster Abbey with great pomp, and buried in the chapel of Henry VII. Deane's widow was granted a pension of &pound;600 a year, secured on estates in Lancashire. Deane left her his property at Hornchurch in Essex and his fee farm rents from the manor of Sydenham and lands at West Court in Ewelme, both in Oxfordshire, but they were burdened with annuities of &pound;25 per annum to his mother and &pound;12 to his sister Jane, whose husband Drue Sparrow had been secretary to Blake and Deane and had been killed standing at their side in the battle of Portland. He was also able to direct that portions of &pound;1000 each should be paid to his two daughters Mary and Hannah, either when they married or reached the age of twenty. On 2 January 1655, being then thirty-two, his widow married Colonel Edward Salmon. After the Restoration Deane's remains were among those ordered to be &#145;taken up and buried in some place of the churchyard adjoining&#146;, but the taking up and reburial were done without either ceremony or solemnity, and it is believed that the remains were thrown promiscuously into a common pit.<br>
<br>A month after Deane's death Cromwell wrote to William Penn, vice-admiral of the fleet, &#145;I often think of our great loss in your General Deane, my near friend&#146;  (Gardiner and Atkinson, 5.266&#150;7). Cromwell had been deeply upset by Deane's death and had gone in person to console his widow. They had worked closely together and shared common political and religious attitudes as well as being distantly related. Deane had been a strong supporter of <span class="italic">The Heads of Proposals</span>, had signed the king's death warrant, and had sided with Cromwell over the Leveller <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> as against the stance of Rainborowe. He shared Cromwell's strong puritan convictions and his desire for religious toleration, though that did not extend to Roman Catholics. He had a strong mystical streak, being described as a Behmenist (or disciple of Jakob Boehme), and both he and his wife had premonitions of his death. She claimed she had seen it in a vision before it was announced to her, while for him it was foreshadowed in the discovery that part of his doublet had been eaten by rats. Even Clarendon recorded that Deane had &#145;the reputation of a bold and excellent officer&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 5.288). For all his talents he comes across as a fixer and an enabler, the ideal second-in-command. Perhaps, though, such an impression may just be the result of his living in the shadow of two such colleagues as Blake and Monck. If the cannon ball had hit Monck instead perhaps Deane would be thought of differently.<br>
