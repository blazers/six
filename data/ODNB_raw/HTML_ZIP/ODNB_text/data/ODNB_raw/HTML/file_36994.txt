<span class="headword">Wolmark,  Alfred Aaron</span>  (1877&#150;1961), <span class="occ">painter and decorative artist</span>, was born in Warsaw, Poland, on 28 December 1877, the eldest child in the family of four sons and one daughter of Levy and Gitel Wolmark. The Wolmarks, like many other central European Jewish families, were forced by continuous persecution to leave Poland; they emigrated to London during the 1880s&#151;1883 has frequently been quoted but a date nearer 1888 seems more likely. The first extant document relating to Wolmark is his naturalization certificate, filled in by his father and sworn by him at the Worship Street police court in the East End of London on 1 January 1894. This document gives the family's residence as 65 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields; Wolmark's forename is given simply as Aaron, and it is probable that he adopted the English name of Alfred at a slightly later date. No record exists of his early education, which would have taken place within the Jewish community both in Warsaw and Spitalfields; clearly his aptitude for drawing was brought to the notice of the authorities, and he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1895, where he studied for three years, winning a silver medal for figure drawing in December 1896.<br>
<br>While at the Royal Academy Schools, Wolmark was befriended by Anna Wilmersdoerffer, and it was through her influence that he received several portrait commissions; the financial assistance of the Wilmersdoerffer family also enabled him to return to Poland in 1903, where he executed several important works based on Jewish historical subjects, such as <span class="italic">Rabbi Ben Ezra</span>, inspired by Browning's poem. These subject paintings are strongly influenced in technique by his studies of Rembrandt, the only artist to whom he had a lifelong devotion, but in his more spontaneous works he was already beginning to lighten his palette. During the next few years his palette continued to lighten, but it was not until he saw the important exhibition &#145;Manet and the Post-Impressionists&#146;, organized by Roger Fry at the Grafton Galleries, London, during the winter of 1910&#150;11, that the full impact of modern French painting was revealed to him.<br>
<br>On 11 July 1911 Wolmark married Bessie Leah Tapper, the daughter of Russo-Polish Jewish parents from the East End. (The couple had two sons and a daughter.) They set off for an extended honeymoon in Concarneau, where Wolmark painted many studies of Breton fisherfolk and harbour life. This series of paintings executed in bright flat areas of heavily applied pigment reduced his subject matter to its simplest form and led on to the geometric still lifes painted immediately after his return to London. He was at the height of his powers during the years from 1911 to 1915; in addition to painting he turned his hand to the decoration of pots, which he covered in strongly coloured aggressively geometric designs. Interior decoration, the theatre, and stained glass also occupied him at this time. His window for St Mary's Church, Slough (1915), was probably the most daring piece of modern glass in England at the time. Even the frames he designed for his paintings did not escape his decorative urge, being not only painted but, at times, covered with geometric collage of patterned wallpapers. His closest associate at this stage was Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, the French sculptor, who had settled in London. The Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Orl&eacute;ans, acquired his portrait of Gaudier-Brzeska in 1957.<br>
<br>Wolmark despised bohemianism, and, although he liked to play the part of an artist, especially when frequenting the Caf&eacute; Royal in London, it was through the elaboration of his dress rather than its disregard that he wished people to be aware of his profession. There is a massive plaster head of Wolmark by Gaudier-Brzeska which captures his air of self-confidence, tinged with arrogance; the floppy bow-tie and flowing hair hint at the subject's dandified appearance. (Bronze casts are in the principal museums in Southampton, Liverpool, and Birmingham.) Passed as medically unfit for military service in 1915, he spent the war years in England. In 1919 he went to New York, where one of his brothers was living, and painted a series of cityscapes; these paintings were shown at the Kevorkian Galleries, New York, in 1920, and mark the last phase of his contribution to avant-garde British painting. During the ensuing decades he felt himself increasingly out of touch with the modern movement, and settled down to paint landscapes and figure subjects in a highly personal, expressionistic manner; he also did some teaching, not in art schools but rather in the manner of the old masters, taking pupils to work in his studio. In 1928 he held an exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery, London, of portrait drawings of well-known contemporaries, including Israel Zangwill (whose complete works he had illustrated for the Globe Publishing Company three years previously), Jerome K. Jerome, Ford Madox Ford, D. Y. Cameron, and G. K. Chesterton. During his life he held many exhibitions in London, New York, and Paris. An exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, London, in 1948 commemorated his seventieth birthday.<br>
<br>Wolmark died on 6 January 1961 at his home, 54 Colet Gardens, West Kensington, London. A memorial exhibition of his work was held at the Ben Uri Art Gallery, London, during September and October of that year; he had been one of the prime movers in the setting up of the Ben Uri Art Society in 1915, which did so much to foster artistic awareness among East End Jewry. Examples of his work are in the Tate collection and the National Portrait Gallery, London.<br>
