<span class="headword">Porter,  John Scott</span>  (1801&#150;1880), <span class="occ">non-subscribing Presbyterian minister and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 31 December 1801 at Newtownlimavady in co. Londonderry, the eldest son of William Porter (1774&#150;1843) and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1809), daughter of John Scott of Cranny near Omagh. William Porter, who was Presbyterian minister in Newtownlimavady (1799&#150;1830) and clerk of the synod of Ulster (1816&#150;30), was one of the founding fathers of the non-subscribing Remonstrant Synod and its first moderator (1830&#150;31), after which he was its clerk until his death.<br>
<br>John Scott Porter was educated locally and in a classical school in Artillery Lane, Londonderry, founded in 1810 by two Presbyterian ministers, George Hay and William Moore. Received as a student for the ministry by the Strabane presbytery, he took his courses in arts and divinity at the Belfast Academical Institution from 1817 until 1825&#151;with an interval (1819&#150;21) spent as tutor in a family in co. Kilkenny. Described by a contemporary as &#145;the ablest student of his time&#146;  (Gordon, <span class="italic">Memorial Addresses</span>, 6), he was licensed by the non-subscribing presbytery of Bangor in October 1825. On 1 January 1826 he was called to the English Presbyterian congregation in Carter Lane, not far from St Paul's Cathedral in London, in succession to John Hoppus, who had been appointed to a professorship of philosophy in University College, London. The theological complexion of the Carter Lane congregation was Arian (essentially anti-trinitarian but holding to a measure of divinity for Christ), and Porter's ministry there brought him into friendly association with the Revd Thomas Belsham, friend and disciple of Joseph Priestley, though Porter never shared their radical unitarianism. Scholar that he was, he shared in running a school at his home, Rosoman House, Islington Green, in north London. A stern pedagogue, he was nicknamed the Lion by his pupils, who included two future lord mayors of London. He also edited an Arian monthly magazine, the <span class="italic">Christian Moderator</span>, in which the orthodox party in the synod of Ulster were derided as &#145;empty skulls&#146;  (<span class="italic">Christian Moderator</span>, June 1826, 50).<br>
<br>Having declined a call to the Second Presbyterian Congregation in Belfast in 1829 Porter accepted one to the First Congregation in September 1831, in succession to William Bruce (1757&#150;1841). He was a colleague of Bruce's son, also named William (1790&#150;1868), whose appointment as professor of Greek in the Belfast Academical Institution in 1821 sparked off the conflict which divided the synod of Ulster in the 1820s and led to the remonstrant schism in 1830. Porter was installed in the Belfast congregation by the presbytery of Antrim on 2 February 1832 and on 8 October 1833 he married Margaret Marshall (1812&#150;1879), daughter of Andrew Marshall MD, of Belfast. Porter quickly became a leading proponent of the Arian, non-subscribing Presbyterian cause in Ulster, &#145;always ready to defend these views when they were assailed, some might think with excessive ardour&#146;  (Gordon, <span class="italic">Memorial Addresses</span>, 6). In 1834 he participated in a public theological debate with Daniel Bagot, later dean of Dromore. The published account of their exchanges, the <span class="italic">Authentic Report of the Discussion on the Unitarian Controversy</span>, went through four editions and Porter received a presentation of nearly &pound;1000 from his admirers.<br>
<br>In 1838 Porter and the Revd Henry Montgomery were appointed as divinity professors in the Belfast Academical Institution for the Association of Irish Non-Subscribing Presbyterians, and in 1847 these chairs were endowed by government with salaries of &pound;150 a year. Porter's subjects were biblical criticism and theology, to which were added Hebrew and Greek in 1851. Porter was as inspiring a teacher as he was an effective preacher and faithful pastor. He played an active role in the literary, educational, musical, and charitable life of Belfast, where he became a familiar and respected figure, tall and handsome, distinguished in his later years by his snow-white hair and beard. For two periods, 1835&#150;6 and 1838&#150;42, he edited the <span class="italic">Bible Christian</span>, a monthly journal of the non-subscribers in reply to the <span class="italic">Orthodox Presbyterian</span>, and he also contributed to the <span class="italic">Irish Unitarian Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">Christian Reformer</span>, and the <span class="italic">Christian Unitarian</span>. His thirty-eight publications were chiefly sermons and polemical pieces but they included contributions to biblical and theological scholarship. His <span class="italic">Twelve Lectures in Illustration and Defence of Unitarianism</span>, published in Belfast in 1841, was republished in London in a second edition in 1853. In his special field of textual criticism his <span class="italic">Principles of textual criticism &hellip; illustrated with plates and facsimiles of biblical documents</span> was published in London in 1848.<br>
<br>Porter supported J. W. Colenso in his higher critical work on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, and accepted that elements in the nativity stories in <span class="roman">Matthew</span> and <span class="roman">Luke</span> were unhistorical. Yet he published a defence of the integrity of the fourth gospel as the authentic gospel of <span class="roman">John</span>. He always maintained his belief in the authority of scripture as divine revelation and of Christ as risen and ascended king and head of the church. In 1862 he led a secession of five congregations from the presbytery of Antrim, of which he had been clerk; this followed the presbytery's rejection of a resolution prohibiting it from licensing or ordaining any person unless satisfied that he believed both in Christ's divine authority and that the scriptures contained divine revelation. Porter acted as clerk of the breakaway presbytery until 1878, and the schism was not healed until 1894. Porter was as much opposed to radical theological reductionism as he was to orthodox Calvinism.<br>
<br>Following the death of his wife, Margaret, on 7 April 1879 Porter fell ill; he died at his home, Lennoxvale, Malone Road, Belfast, on 5 July 1880. A black marble Celtic cross marks his grave in Belfast's borough cemetery, where he was buried on 8 July 1880. His portrait, painted by Ebenezer Crawford, is in the First Presbyterian Church in Belfast, where there is also a memorial tablet. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35579/', "Andrew Marshall Porter")</script>, was master of the rolls in Ireland from 1883 to 1906.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22582"></a><span class="headword">William Porter</span>  (1805&#150;1880)<span class="occ"></span>, younger brother of John Scott Porter, was born at Artikelly near Newtownlimavady on 15 September 1805 and was also educated locally and in the classical school in Artillery Lane in Londonderry. Apprenticed to the iron and timber business of John Classon, brother of his father's second wife, Eliza <i>n&eacute;e</i> Classon (<i>d</i>. 1852), he showed little aptitude for business but was helped to study for the Irish bar by John Classon. Called to the bar in 1831, he practised in the north-east circuit before being appointed in 1839 to the office of attorney-general in the recently established Cape Colony. He owed his appointment by Melbourne's whig government to influential liberal friends who had replaced the old tory establishment as dispensers of patronage. He brought to Cape Colony his &#145;heart-fixed hatred of injustice&#146;  (McCracken, 43) and as attorney-general he insisted on equal justice for all, irrespective of colour or class. He used his <i>ex officio</i> role in the executive and legislative councils and as legal adviser to the government to promote liberal values, and in 1854 drew up a constitution providing for a parliament elected by black and white voters on equal terms.<br>
<br>After retiring as attorney-general in 1865 Porter was elected to parliament and continued to campaign for responsible government and religious freedom, advocating such advanced ideas as the abolition of capital punishment and the provision of higher education for both men and women. Tall and handsome, well-read both in law and in literature, he was an effective orator and wielded considerable influence in the colony and in its parliament. He declined many offers of honours and advancement, including a knighthood and the prime-ministership in the Cape parliament, accepting only a CMG in 1872 before he left the colony. On his retirement as attorney-general his full salary was continued for life, though he devoted the extra income this gave him to endowing a university in Cape Town, of which he became chancellor in 1876.<br>
<br>Porter never married, but had a lifelong relationship with Hugh Lynar, whom he met in Dublin and who accompanied him to Cape Colony where he became his clerk and shared his home&#151;without, apparently, attracting adverse reactions from either Porter's family or from public opinion in the colony. After Lynar's death in 1873 Porter returned to Ireland to live with his brother John Scott in his home in College Square East in the centre of Belfast, and later in Lennoxvale in the suburbs. He died on 13 July 1880 after a brief illness, only eight days after his brother's death, and was buried in the borough cemetery, Belfast, on 16 July. His continuing interest in Cape Colony was reflected in his generous provision from his substantial estate for institutions in the colony, including &pound;20,000 to a reformatory for boys in Cape Town.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22561"></a><span class="headword">Classon Emmett Porter</span>  (1814&#150;1885)<span class="occ"></span>, half-brother of John Scott and William Porter, was born at Artikelly in 1814, the eldest son of the Revd William Porter and his second wife, Eliza Classon (<i>d</i>. 1852), of Dublin. He was educated locally and in Manchester College, at that time in York, from 1828 until 1834. On 3 July 1834 he was ordained and installed by the presbytery of Antrim in the non-subscribing congregation of Larne in co. Antrim, where he remained until his retirement in 1875. He married in 1853 Eliza Ann Wallace, from Omagh, to whom he was distantly related; they had three sons. He was widely respected for his integrity, scholarship, and efforts to improve the quality of life of his local community. He promoted non-sectarian education, and laid the foundations of Larne grammar school. In 1840 he set up a female industrial school to train poor girls in embroidery and knitting skills. He also initiated a local loan fund to lend money at reasonable rates of interest. He disliked public controversy, and avoided it after exchanges with his orthodox Presbyterian neighbour, the Revd H. W. Molyneaux; these were over the <span class="roman">Dissenters' Chapels Act</span> of 1844, which secured unitarians and non-subscribing Presbyterians in the possession of their congregational properties. Porter's contributions to local and church history were numerous, appearing originally in local newspapers. Some collections of his pieces were published, notably <span class="italic">Irish Presbyterian Biographical Sketches</span> in 1883 and <span class="italic">Ulster Biographical Sketches</span> in 1884. A farmer as well as a minister and a major beneficiary of his half-brother William's estate, he retired early to live in Ballygally Castle on the Antrim coast road. He died on 27 May 1885 and was buried three days later in Cairncastle churchyard, where his grave is marked by a handsome Celtic cross. There are substantial collections of his papers and publications in the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and in Larne Public Library.<br>
<br>Two other sons were born to the Revd William Porter and his second wife; the second, James Nixon Porter (1815&#150;1875), became a unitarian minister in Carrickfergus near Larne (1838&#150;62), and in Warrington, Lancashire (1862&#150;72). The youngest son, Francis, followed William Porter to Cape Town, where after a career in business he died on 28 February 1886. A daughter of the Revd William Porter, Mary Ann, married F. D. Finlay, founder of the Belfast Liberal newspaper the <span class="italic">Northern Whig</span>.<br>
