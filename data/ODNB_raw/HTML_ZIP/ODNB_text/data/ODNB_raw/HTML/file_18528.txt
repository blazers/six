<span class="headword">Mell,  Davis</span>  (1604&#150;1662), <span class="occ">violinist and clockmaker</span>, was born on 15 November 1604 at Wilton near Salisbury, where his father, Leonard Mell (<i>d</i>. 1641), was in the employ of William Herbert, third earl of Pembroke. Although not appointed to a place in the court musical establishment until late in 1626, Mell was apparently associated with the violins at least since May of the preceding year (when he received livery for the funeral of James I). He was heavily involved with the inns of court masque <span class="italic">The Triumph of Peace</span> (1634): he not only played with the violin band for the performances but also composed some of the antimasque dances and accompanied the masquers' rehearsals.<br>
<br>When the court music was disbanded in 1642, Mell remained in London earning a living from teaching and playing. Playford listed him in <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span> (1651) among the &#145;excellent and able Masters &hellip; For the Voyce or Viole&#146;. Mell was one of the five musicians employed by Cromwell from <i>c</i>.1654. Early in 1657 these five petitioned Cromwell to re-establish a Musicians' Company as a way of trying to offset the damage to the profession caused by the breakup of court and ecclesiastical musical establishments. Mell walked in Cromwell's funeral procession.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Mell took up his old place in the court violins and was appointed to a place in the private music. In May 1661 (less than a year before his death) he was given joint authority (with George Hudson) over the violins.<br>
<br>All the accounts of Mell's violin playing suggest that he was a fine musician. Lodewijck Huygens recorded in his journal for March 1652 that he played &#145;admirably well&#146;. Four months later, on 1 August, John Evelyn described Mell in his diary as a &#145;rare musician&#146;. Anthony Wood, who heard him in Oxford in March 1658, reported that &#145;The Company did look upon Mr Mell to have a prodigious hand on the violin, and they thought that no person, as all London did, could goe beyond him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 1.242). This group were to revise their notions of Mell's supremacy when, just four months later, they first heard Thomas Baltzar's technical virtuosity. Even then, however, Mell's playing was judged &#145;farr sweeter than Baltsar&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Mell's compositions are well represented in John Playford's publications, especially <span class="italic">Courtly Masquing Ayres</span> (1662), which contains a total of fifty-four dances grouped by key into suites, and <span class="italic">The Division Violin</span> (1684). Oxford, Christ Church, MS 433 is an autograph manuscript containing versions of the violin suites without an accompanying bass line. In comparison with other English violin compositions of the period, at least, they show quite a sophisticated technique.<br>
<br>Presumably because of the precariousness of the music profession during the Commonwealth, Mell developed an alternative career as a clockmaker. The first mention of his horological skills occurs in Samuel Hartlib's &#145;Ephemerides&#146; of 1649:<blockquote>Mr Mell one of the king's Musitians very excellent in his Art and of a very inventive genius. Hee hath made a most admirable Clocke of 50 lb. or more price which should bee sent for a present to some king in the Indies.</blockquote>Mell was admitted as a free brother to the Clockmakers' Company in 1655 and four years later was made an assistant of the company (a status which implied some responsibility for the governance of the guild). According to Aubrey  (<span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, 1696), Mell &#145;made a great name for the goodness of his work&#146;, and the few surviving examples of his work (including one with statuettes of musicians revolving in a little gallery above the clock face) seem to be beautifully made. After the Restoration, when Mell was once again fully occupied as a musician, he apparently abandoned clockmaking. He no longer attended company meetings, and in 1661 his one remaining apprentice was transferred to another maker.<br>
<br>Mell married Alice Comey on 30 April 1635, and their first daughter, Dorothy, was born exactly nine months later (she appears not to have survived beyond infancy). A son, Richard, born in 1637, died at the age of three. But two daughters, Abigail and Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1641), reached adulthood and were named as executors of Mell's will, written in 1662, which provides for a second wife, Ann (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Allen). Mell died on 27 April 1662.<br>
