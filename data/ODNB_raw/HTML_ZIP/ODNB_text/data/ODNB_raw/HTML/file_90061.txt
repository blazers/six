<span class="headword">Sugden, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1918&#150;2003), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 12 September 1918 at 73 Casson Street, Gorton, Manchester, the second child in the family of four sons and one daughter of Arthur Sugden (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1938), a timekeeper at the wagon works of the London and North Western Railway, and his wife, Elizabeth Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wardle, a secretary at a cotton firm. Unable to take up a scholarship at Manchester grammar school because of his mother's illness, he remained at Thomas Street elementary school until he was fourteen, when he took and passed the entrance examination for the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). He started work in 1933 as a junior accounts clerk, while studying accountancy at a day continuation school and at night school. He later qualified as a certified accountant and a chartered secretary.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Sugden joined the Royal Artillery as a private soldier, but was selected for officer training, and ended the war with the rank of major, having worked on mathematical gunnery. On 28 June 1941 he married Elsie Collins (<i>d</i>. 1945), a 24-year-old machinist and daughter of Robert Collins, rubber worker; they had one son. Following her death Sugden married, on 28 October 1946, Agnes Warrender, a 26-year-old widow, and daughter of Francis Grayston, engineer. There was one son from this marriage.<br>
<br>Returning to the accountancy department of the CWS in 1946 as an accountancy assistant, Sugden became manager of the sales and accounts department in 1950, and in 1954 moved into factory management as general manager of the CWS margarine works and lard refinery. After ten successful years at the margarine works, during which the factory became the most profitable in the CWS, in 1964 Sugden was promoted to become general manager of the newly created edible oils and fats group of five factories involved in the manufacture and processing of butter, margarine, lard, and other edible oils and fats.<br>
<br>The CWS had grown out of the North of England Co-operative Society, founded in 1865 to buy goods in bulk and supply the local retail co-operative societies, and had since built its own factories and developed services such as banking and insurance. Owned by the retail societies, which dominated the board of directors, the CWS was a leading member of the Co-operative Union. By the mid-1960s the CWS and the retail societies were in difficulties, facing competition from the large multiples, and, after widespread consultation, radical changes were made in an effort to ensure the survival of the co-operative movement. A new management structure was approved, and in 1967 the society appointed its first chief executive officer, heading three divisions, each under a deputy chief executive officer. Sugden was appointed deputy chief executive officer in charge of the food division, by far the largest. The society launched Operation Facelift at the end of 1968, in an attempt to improve the public image of the Co-op and create a national brand. The Co-op brand name and symbol were introduced, the CWS helped local societies to transform their shops and financed the building of supermarkets, and a large-scale advertising campaign was launched with the slogan &#145;It's all at the Co-op, now&#146;. After further reorganization, in 1971 Sugden was appointed sole deputy chief executive officer, and as such played an important part in bringing about the merger of the Scottish CWS and the CWS in 1973, following the collapse of the Scottish CWS Bank.<br>
<br>In 1974 Sugden became chief executive officer of the CWS, based at its headquarters in Manchester. He carried on with the programme of modernization and rationalization: inefficient CWS factories were closed down and new ones built; small local societies were encouraged to amalgamate into larger regional societies; regional distribution centres, to supply food to the local co-op shops, were developed, and the CWS bought goods for the local co-ops from suppliers other than CWS factories if it could get better value. A new advertising campaign was launched in 1976 with the theme &#145;Your caring sharing Co-op&#146;, reaffirming the principles of the co-operative movement. By the end of the decade, despite the fierce retail price war with the big chains such as Tesco, which hit the profits of many of the smaller shops, the Co-op had managed to maintain its market share, especially in food. Sugden had played a large part in this, even though he was careful to keep a low profile. When he took over in 1974 he said, &#145;I will dominate the CWS management &hellip; But it really will be best if no-one actually thinks I am doing so&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 July 2003), but at the same time he assured members that the CWS was not seeking to control the Co-op movement. He appreciated that the Co-op was owned by its 11 million members and existed for the sake of its members, but he was never able to solve the problem of the relationship between the CWS and the retail societies. The small societies resisted change for fear of losing their independence, and despite the aim of reducing the number of societies to fifty or fewer, there were still over two hundred at the end of the 1970s. They also resented the CWS's domination of national planning, and feared that the CWS was becoming indistinguishable from any other big business, even though in his presidential address to the Annual Co-operative Congress in 1978 Sugden stressed the need to act together as one movement &#145;without destroying those characteristic features which distinguish the consumers' co-operative movement from all other forms of economic activity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of the Annual Co-operative Congress</span>, 1978, 16).<br>
<br>Sugden was also appointed chairman of the Co-op Bank in 1974. The Co-op Bank had developed out of the CWS Bank. The latter had until recently existed mainly for the benefit of the co-operative movement, but in 1971 it had become a separate legal entity, though still owned by the CWS, and it was admitted as a member of the bankers' clearing house in 1974. The first British bank to offer free banking, it was also the only bank to pay interest on current account balances, and because many branches were opened in Co-op shops, it was able to open for longer hours than other banks. It expanded rapidly in the 1970s as a major consumers' bank, attracting large numbers who had never had a bank account before. In 1977 Sugden was invited to serve on the Wilson committee to review the functioning of financial institutions. A member of the working party to consider the setting up of a co-operative development agency, he was appointed a member of its board when it was established in 1978. He was also involved in the international co-operative movement as a board member of Euro-Coop and Inter-Coop: he served as president of Inter-Coop from 1979 to 1980, and he was a member of the central council of the International Co-operative Alliance.<br>
<br>Sugden was knighted in 1978. He took early retirement in 1980 after his wife was attacked and kidnapped from their home, and held to ransom, before managing to escape from the boot of the kidnapper's car. Quiet and courteous, Sugden was a tough and persistent negotiator. A strong believer in the ideals of the co-operative movement, he was determined to modernize the CWS in order that it and the movement would survive. He died on 7 June 2003 at Hope Green Residential Home for the Elderly, London Road, Adlington, Cheshire, of pneumonia and cerebrovascular disease, and was buried at Handforth, Cheshire, on 13 June. He was survived by his wife, Agnes, and one son, Keith, his other son having predeceased him.<br>
