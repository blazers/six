<span class="headword">Bolland, Sir  William</span>  (1772&#150;1840), <span class="occ">lawyer and book collector</span>, was born on 21 August 1772 and baptized at St Olave, Southwark, on 13 September, the eldest son of James Bolland of Southwark, and his wife, Mary. He was educated under Dr Valpy at Reading School where he wrote several prologues and epilogues for the school's annual dramatic performances. He then went to Trinity College, Cambridge, matriculating on 26 September 1789 at the age of seventeen. He graduated BA in 1794, proceeded to his MA in 1797, and won the Seatonian prize for poems on miracles (1797), the Epiphany (1798), and St Paul at Athens (1799). These prize-winning poems were printed separately, as well as being published in the <span class="italic">Seatonian Prize Poems</span> (1808).<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge, Bolland trained as a lawyer, and was called to the bar by the Middle Temple on 24 April 1801. He practised at the Old Bailey with great success, built up a good commercial practice, and was one of the four city pleaders (1804&#150;29). On 1 August 1810 he married his cousin Elizabeth, the third daughter of John Bolland of Clapham, Surrey.<br>
<br>From April 1817 until he was raised to the bench Bolland was recorder of Reading. He was a candidate for the common serjeantcy (or office of circuit judge of the criminal court) of the City of London in 1822, but was defeated by Lord Denman. In November 1829 he was created a baron of the exchequer, resigning in January 1839 on grounds of ill health.<br>
<br>In 1800 Bolland issued an anonymous satire, <span class="italic">The Campaign, to his Royal Highness the Duke of York, Britannia in the Year 1800 to C. J. Fox</span>, which was circulated privately among his friends. Although he did not publish much, he was an enthusiast for early English literature and assembled an impressive library. Called &#145;Hortensius&#146; by his friends, Bolland was remembered for his dinner parties as well as his scholarship. It was at one such party at the Adelphi Terrace that the Roxburghe Club was formed. Its first publication was <span class="italic">Certain bokes of Virgiles Aenaeis turned into English meter. By the right honorable lorde, Henry, earl of Surrey</span>, reprinted in 1814 (though the dedication was signed 17 June 1815), which presented the 1557 translation (held at Dulwich College) of books II and IV of the <span class="italic">Aenaeis</span> to a wider public. Bolland died at Hyde Park Terrace, London, on 14 May 1840. His library, which included some three thousand volumes, was sold for a total of about &pound;3000.<br>
