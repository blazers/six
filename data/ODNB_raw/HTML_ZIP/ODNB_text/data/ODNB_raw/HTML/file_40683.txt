<span class="headword">Moores,  Cecil</span>  (1902&#150;1989), <span class="occ">businessman</span>, was born on 10 August 1902 in Manchester, the fifth child and third son in the family of four sons and four daughters of John William Moores (1871&#150;1919), builder, and his wife, Louisa Fethney (1873&#150;1959). He completed state elementary and secondary education, and in the early 1920s worked in a variety of jobs, which included training as an analytical chemist.<br>
<br>In 1924 Cecil joined his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40918/', "John Moores")</script> in helping to run the Littlewoods Pools business, which the elder brother had already started. By 1932 it was so thriving and successful that John Moores decided to concentrate his attention on diversification and left the core pools business in the safe control of his brother. Cecil Moores's name became synonymous with what was Britain's, indeed probably the world's, largest football pools business. He was also a director of the Littlewoods organization, lending his considerable experience and talents to the progress of the other major businesses in the group, such as chain stores and mail order.<br>
<br>Moores was a loyal Briton, buying the famous Bapton herd of dairy shorthorn cattle in the early 1950s to prevent its being exported to America. Under his direction the herd won many prizes in national competitions and when he eventually came to sell it he imposed a rigid condition that it should stay in Aberdeenshire, to which he had moved it after its acquisition.<br>
<br>Moores's devotion to the work ethic was profound, but he also believed in enjoying life. His philosophy managed to combine both approaches: &#145;it is fun to work hard and to build a business&#146;. His care of his employees embraced both these precepts also: he wanted to give them chances for &#145;fun&#146; as well as for &#145;improvement&#146;. His concern for them and their working conditions provided the company's employees with numerous social benefits long before the welfare state became a reality. This concern was extended to his customers&#151;for example, in 1957 he initiated a &#145;winners' advisory service&#146; to help winners of very large sums to adjust to and cope with a sudden and unexpected fortune. He believed in practical involvement in management and his personal presence was manifest daily throughout the pools company. He arrived before most of the staff and usually did not depart until long after they had gone home.<br>
<br>Moores's drive and organizing ability came to fruition with the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Virtually overnight the pools company was turned into an efficient war production machine, manufacturing and supplying everything from parachutes to Wellington bombers. The speed and efficiency with which a largely female clerical labour force was retrained and applied to these new activities were due in very large measure to the abilities of Cecil Moores. After the war he speedily guided Littlewoods Pools back to its pre-eminent position. He oversaw all the major developments in the pools industry, including, for example, the mechanization of the business, the provision of a nationwide coupon collector service (from 1957), and the use of Australian fixtures during the summer (from 1949). A shrewd man, he was once described as &#145;beady-eyed and on the ball&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Moores was also keenly interested in many sports. As a young man he was an amateur soccer player for Hyde United and later played for the amateur Liverpool side the Azoics. Throughout his life he was a supporter of both Liverpool and Everton football clubs. He was also a horse-racing enthusiast and pursued numerous other sporting activities, including golf, snooker, shooting, and salmon and trout fishing&#151;at all of which he characteristically became proficient. In 1975 he was the driving force behind the formation of the Football Ground Improvement Trust (later the Football Trust), which provided about &pound;40 million a year to help football at all levels.<br>
<br>Cecil Moores was of medium height and stocky build, with straight brown hair and blue eyes. Totally without &#145;side&#146;, he could get on with people from all walks of life. On 11 June 1930 he married Doris May (<i>d</i>. 1988), daughter of Thomas Steel, electrician. They had a daughter and two sons, the elder of whom, Nigel, died as a result of a motor accident in 1977. Moores was a devoted family man. He was also a generous host who enjoyed entertaining his friends and relatives in the house that he loved, which he had bought in Freshfield, Lancashire, before the Second World War. He could also entertain in other circumstances, and it was said of him that he was &#145;the best after-dinner speaker I've ever heard&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Although Moores retired in 1979 as chairman of Littlewoods Pools, in old age he continued, as president of the business, to attend his office daily, maintaining regular contact with the family business. He died on 29 July 1989 while on a fishing holiday at Loch Trool in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, one year after the death of his wife.<br>
