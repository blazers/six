<span class="headword">McAllister,  Anne Hutchison</span>  (1892&#150;1983), <span class="occ">speech therapist and teacher</span>, the daughter of Robert Dempster McAllister, apothecary, and his wife, Anne Hutchison Macnee, was born at Main Street, Biggar, on 29 November 1892. She graduated MA (1917) and BEd (1924) from Glasgow University, and after teaching in a Glasgow school studied phonetics in order to apply its script to the teaching of reading. She became a lecturer in phonetics at Stow College, Glasgow, in 1919, and later at the city's teacher training college at Jordanhill. After being invited by Matthew White, a paediatric surgeon, to investigate and treat the speech problems of children with cleft palates which White had repaired, Anne McAllister in 1929 established a speech clinic attached to Glasgow's Sick Children's Hospital, with helpers recruited from among psychologists, phoneticians, and teachers. By the early 1930s a practical training course had been established, supplemented by lectures on psychology, phonetics, and the anatomy and physiology of the speech organs. The course led to the foundation of the Glasgow School of Speech Therapy in 1935, of which McAllister was principal until her retirement in 1964.<br>
<br>McAllister carried out research on the speech rhythms of over 21,000 Dunbartonshire schoolchildren and found that many were suffering from speech defects; she published her findings in <span class="italic">Clinical Studies in Speech Therapy</span> (1937). Between 1935 and 1940 she broadcast courses on speech training to Scottish schools and in 1938 she published <span class="italic">A Year's Course in Speech Training</span>; this was followed in 1941 by <span class="italic">The Primary Teacher's Guide to Speech Training</span>. During the Second World War McAllister was recruited by John Gaylor, neurologist at the Killearn Hospital, to assist in studying the speech and language problems of servicemen who had suffered head injuries. This led her to start studying neuroanatomy and neurology in order to help her to understand different types of aphasia and dysarthria.<br>
<br>During the course of her work McAllister had come into contact with many other speech therapists and in 1945, with the help of medical specialists and others, she played a key role in the establishment of the College of Speech Therapists, which organized the profession's training, examination, and registration. McAllister was one of the college's twelve founder fellows. She was appointed OBE in 1953.<br>
<br>McAllister was at heart a teacher. Her therapy was a form of remedial education and her interests extended from speech therapy to physical disabilities and learning difficulties. She became national president of the Special Schools Association in 1961. McAllister was extremely shrewd and could be trenchant in her criticism of the indolent and sloppy, but was kindly, firm, and resourceful with her patients. She never married and with regard to spinsterhood she said, &#145;Once you get over the disgrace, it's the best life!&#146; She died at her home, 31 Rowallan Gardens, Glasgow, on 5 April 1983.<br>
