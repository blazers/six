<span class="headword">Rose,  John</span>  (1619&#150;1677), <span class="occ">gardener and nurseryman</span>, was born in Amesbury, Wiltshire, the younger son of Stephen Rose, yeoman farmer. His gardening career may have started at Amesbury House, the property of Sir William Seymour, later second duke of Hertford and second duke of Somerset. The duke's London residence was Essex House, the property of his brother-in-law, Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex, another of Rose's employers, who encouraged him to the extent of sending him to France for the first time, probably early in the 1640s.<br>
<br>This visit proved to be the perfect preparation for importing the influence of French garden design to England, and after the restoration of Charles II in 1660 both Rose and his master were ready to follow some of the examples given in the work of Andr&eacute; Le N&ocirc;tre, particularly at Versailles. On 14 October 1661 Rose was appointed the king's gardener at St James's&#151;that is, the person in charge of establishing a garden between the Mall and the backs of houses in Pall Mall, a garden disturbed about 1709 for the building of Marlborough House and Carlton House. Later Rose also took charge of St James's Park across the Mall. Just before his royal appointment Rose may have been the &#145;Mr Rowse&#146; looking after the gardens at Woburn Abbey from about 1658 to 1661.<br>
<br>In 1666 the first edition of Rose's little book, <span class="italic">The English Vineyard Vindicated</span>, was published, with no indication on its title-page of the contribution to it by John Evelyn, though his identity was revealed in the preface by &#145;Philocepos&#146;, who mentioned Evelyn's recent <span class="italic">Sylva</span>. Evelyn's material came from Rose, for &#145;He reason'd so pertinently upon the Subject (as indeed he does upon all things which concern his hortulan Profession)&#146;, as the preface says  (Rose, 8). Rose dedicated the book to the king, &#145;the Prince of Plants to the Prince of Planters&#146;  (ibid., 4). Although <span class="italic">Vineyard</span> had little effect on the planting of vines in England, it was popular enough to be reprinted four times as an appendix to Evelyn's translation of Nicolas de Bonnefons's <span class="italic">The French Gardiner</span>, in successive editions from 1669 to 1691. Rose used the book to sell vines too, &#145;my self also with so plentiful a Stock of Sets and Plants of all those Sorts which I chiefly recommend, that those who have a desire to Store their Grounds, may receive them of me at very reasonable Rates&#146;  (ibid., 36).<br>
<br>The gardener presenting a pineapple to the king in a painting attributed to Hendrik Danckerts, possibly painted about 1670 (later in the collection at Houghton House), is said to be John Rose, and several copies of this picture&#151;at Ham House and elsewhere&#151;demonstrate an interest in this exotic fruit. Although pineapples from Barbados were first brought to England in 1657 and West Indian ones were given to the king in 1661 and 1668, it is unlikely that the fruit was grown successfully in England until about 1690, at Hampton Court, then in the charge of George London, Rose's pupil, who succeeded him as the royal gardener. London's later partner in the Brompton Park nursery, Henry Wise, was another of Rose's apprentices, whose influence on the design of formal gardens was handed on in this way to the next generation. Though Rose is most often associated with vines and pineapples, he also planted dwarf fruit-trees, especially pears, in the garden at St James's, and earlier in his career he exchanged rare auriculas, anemones, and other flowers with gardeners as eminent as Sir Thomas Hanmer and John Rea.<br>
<br>Rose died on 10 September 1677 and was buried in his parish church of St Martin-in-the-Fields a week later. His wife Mary, daughter of Thomas Chamberlain, died in December 1676 and was buried in the same church. His will, which mentions no immediate family, left bequests for the establishment of schools for boys and girls in Amesbury, where Rose's grammar school survived into the nineteenth century.<br>
