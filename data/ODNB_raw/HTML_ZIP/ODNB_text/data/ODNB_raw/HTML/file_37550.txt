<span class="headword">Hiorne,  Francis</span>  (1744&#150;1789), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was the elder son of William Hiorne (<i>c</i>.1712&#150;1776), mason and architect of Warwick, and his first wife, Mary Duncalfe. William Hiorne and his younger brother David (1715&#150;1758) had established themselves as leading practitioners of their trade in the midland area, and Francis Hiorne succeeded to the family business on the death of his father. By then he was already active as an architect and his subsequent practice, mainly in the midlands but also on occasion further afield, developed immediately; however, his career was cut short by his early death at the age of forty-five and the total number of his executed works was not large.<br>
<br>Hiorne's work in a classical idiom included two buildings of some individuality, the churches of St Anne's, Belfast (1776; dem.), which showed the influence of the baroque St Philip's, Birmingham, and Tardebigge, Worcestershire (1777), with its striking needle spire. But it was as an architect specializing in the Gothic style that he gained a particular reputation. His best-known work, Tetbury church, Gloucestershire (1777&#150;81), is one of the most elegant examples of late eighteenth-century Gothic and was widely admired at the time: the poet William Mason, for example, commented that it gave him &#145;the very highest opinion&#146; of Hiorne's &#145;Gothic taste&#146;. Hiorne's approach to Gothic design appears to have embraced at least the rudiments of scholarship as well as its decorative appeal: his preparations for carrying out work at Arundel Castle, Sussex&#151;a project curtailed by his death&#151;were reported by a correspondent of the antiquary Richard Gough in 1787:<blockquote>At Greystoke Castle I found Mr. Hiorne the gothic architect, whom the Duke of Norfolk had invited there to consult with relative to his intended repairs at Arundel Castle; and we made a party to see Alnwick Castle, etc. in Northumberland, for Mr. Hiorne's information. (Nichols, 423)</blockquote>Hiorne's antiquarian leanings are reflected in his election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1784; and like his father, who had been an alderman of Warwick and served as mayor in 1765&#150;6, he was also a prominent figure in the public life of his home town. He was elected an alderman in October 1773, held office as mayor in 1773&#150;4, 1782&#150;3, and 1787&#150;8, served as treasurer to the corporation from 1781 to 1789, and as the Warwickshire county bridgemaster during the same period. He died in Warwick on 9 December 1789, in his will leaving to his wife, Elizabeth, a newly built house at Beausale, near Warwick.<br>
