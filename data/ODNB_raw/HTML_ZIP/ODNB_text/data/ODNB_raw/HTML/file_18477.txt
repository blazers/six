<span class="headword">Meadows,  John</span>  (1622&#150;1697), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Chattisham, near Ipswich, Suffolk, on 7 April 1622, the second son of Daniel Meadowe (1577&#150;1651) of Chattisham and his wife, Elizabeth Smith of Wickham Market (<i>d</i>. 1678); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18479/', "Sir Philip Meadows (bap. 1626, d. 1718)")</script> the diplomat was his younger brother. On 26 February 1640 he was admitted at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and graduated BA early in 1644. He moved to Christ's College on 23 December that year, taking up one of the fellowships made vacant there by the parliamentary commissioners, and proceeded MA in 1647. Following the death of his father in 1651 Meadows inherited substantial property, including the manor and advowson of Witnesham, and that year he resigned his fellowship.<br>
<br>In 1653 Meadows married Anne, daughter of Roger Rant of Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire, who brought him an estate at Exning, Suffolk. On 26 August that year he settled at Ousden Hall, the home of his patron Humphrey Mosely, where he was provided with a study. Meadows was ordained to the ministry at Ousden on 17 April 1657 by three ministers of the county, William Pickering of Denham, Jonathan Jephcot of Swaffham Prior, and Abraham Wright of Cheveley, and was approved by the commissioners for approbation (or triers) at Whitehall on 7 May 1658. Ejected on 24 August 1662 under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, he was soon forced to vacate the parsonage, recording on 1 October that his wife had gone to live at Ousden Hall. The death of his patron did not result in any abrupt change for Meadows, and John Greene, his successor in the rectory, inducted on 8 August 1663, was friendly (or circumspect) enough to store property for him as late as July 1665. Meadows was joined at Ousden Hall by his mother, who was permitted to stay until her death, aged almost eighty, in 1678. Meadows himself lived there (at a rent of &pound;3 per annum paid from 1665) only until 21 October 1670, when he and Anne went to lodge with a Mr Crane, Anne Meadows died soon afterwards.<br>
<br>By 1672 Meadows had moved to Stowmarket where the sympathetic merchant Thomas Blackerby had his business. There, under the indulgence of that year, he took out licences as a presbyterian teacher, both at his own house and that of Elizabeth Nelson. In 1675 he married Sarah (1654&#150;1688), daughter of Benjamin Fairfax (<i>d</i>. 1708) of Halesworth, Suffolk, and granddaughter and niece of three ejected ministers, Benjamin Fairfax (1592&#150;1676), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9086/', "John Fairfax (1623/4&#150;1700)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9088/', "Nathaniel Fairfax (1637&#150;1690)")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1680 Meadows was prosecuted for nonconformity and bound over by the judges of the sessions. About 1688, perhaps on the death in that year of his wife, Sarah, he moved to Bury St Edmunds, where (it must be supposed) he married his third wife, Hannah Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1707). At Bury he was an occasional conformist and friend of Samuel Bury, the Presbyterian minister. Meadows used part of his considerable wealth to assist less fortunate Independent and Presbyterian ministers. He died at Bury St Edmunds in 1697 and was buried in the churchyard at Stowmarket on 1 March. In his will (proved 7 April 1697) he left property in fourteen Suffolk parishes, including the advowsons of Witnesham and Exning. His second marriage had produced seven children, notably Philip (1679&#150;1752), mayor of Norwich in 1734, and <a name="cosubject_18477"></a><span class="headword">John Meadowes</span>  (1675/6&#150;1757), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, who was born at Stowmarket and attended schools at Stowmarket and at Bury St Edmunds before being admitted, aged eighteen, to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 25 May 1694. Although a scholar between 1694 and 1698, there is no record of his taking a degree. He married Sarah, daughter of Robert Chaplin. Ordained to the Presbyterian church at Needham Market, Suffolk, on 26 August 1702, he served there for the rest of his life. His <span class="italic">The Apostolic Rule of Ordination</span> appeared in 1738. He died on 10 April 1757 and was buried at Barking.<br>
