<span class="headword">Fitzherbert <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smythe; <em>other married name </em>Weld]</span>,  Maria Anne</span>  (1756&#150;1837), <span class="occ">unlawful wife of George IV by a marriage invalid under the Royal Marriages Act of 1772</span>, was born on 26 July 1756, the first of two daughters and four sons of Walter Smythe (<i>d</i>. 1788), former soldier, of Acton Burnell, Shropshire, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1741&#150;1807), daughter of John Errington of Andover, Hampshire. Both the Smythes and the Erringtons were well-established members of England's Roman Catholic &#145;cousinhood&#146;. It is not known where Mrs Fitzherbert was born, but there is a tradition that it was in the Red Room at Tong Castle, Shropshire. She spent her infant years at Brambridge, Hampshire, where her father bought an estate, and where she later endowed a mission house. At about the age of twelve she went to the faubourg St Antoine, Paris, to be educated at an English convent run by Conceptionist nuns. On 16 July 1775 she married Edward Weld (1741&#150;1775), landowner, of Lulworth Castle, Dorset, who died on 23 October 1775; then, three years later, Thomas Fitzherbert (1746&#150;1781), also a landowner, of Swynnerton, Staffordshire, who died at Nice on 7 May 1781, reportedly as the result of an illness contracted during the Gordon riots. From her husbands' estates she received jointures amounting in value to over &pound;2500 per annum, as well as the remainder of the lease of Fitzherbert's London house, and all its contents. Her movements are obscure during the following few years, but she was probably in Brighton in 1782, for during the summer of that year a local artist dedicated four views of the Steyne to her.<h2>
<a name="TheprinceofWales"></a>The prince of Wales</h2>There are several accounts of when and where Mrs Fitzherbert first attracted the attention of George Augustus Frederick, prince of Wales (1762&#150;1830), later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10541/', "George IV")</script>. According to her own account, it was about 1780 near Corney House in Chiswick. She was driving with her husband, when the prince stopped his carriage to look at her. They did not speak, however, and it was not until March 1784, after a chance meeting outside the opera house, that he began his pursuit of her in earnest. The romantic story that they first met on Richmond Hill, and that she was the original &#145;sweet lass&#146; of Richmond Hill of the popular ballad, seems to have originated in Charles Langdale's edition of the &#145;narrative&#146; by William Joseph Stourton, fourteenth Baron Stourton, of Mrs Fitzherbert's life and can be discounted. From the start she provoked an attitude of recklessness in the romantic prince. Finding her unwilling to become his mistress, he eventually offered to marry her. Three acts of parliament stood in his way, however: the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> of 1701, the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1707 (both excluding a prince or princess married to a Catholic from succeeding to the throne), and the <span class="roman">Royal Marriages Act</span> of 1772, and she declined his proposal. On learning that she was about to travel abroad, he stabbed himself in Carlton House on 8 July. He sent his surgeon, Thomas Keate; his groom of the stole, Charles Fitzroy, first Baron Southampton; and two other friends to tell her that he would tear open his bandages unless she came to him. Arriving in company with Georgiana Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire, she then agreed to marry the prince, and he placed a ring upon her finger. It was a decision she immediately regretted. After returning to Devonshire House she signed a memorandum composed by the duchess: &#145;We went there [Carlton House] &amp; she promis'd to marry him at her return [from the continent] but she conceives as well as myself that promises obtain'd in such a manner are entirely void&#146;  (<span class="italic">Georgiana</span>, 87). According to Lord Stourton, Mrs Fitzherbert also wrote to Lord Southampton, &#145;protesting against what had taken place, as not being then a free agent&#146;  (Langdale, 119).<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Mrs Fitzherbert left London for the continent. The prince wrote to her repeatedly while she was abroad, begging her to return, and on several occasions he threatened to join her. In October 1785 she decided to honour her promise after all and return to London. &#145;I have told him I will be his&#146;, she told her confidante Lady Anne Lindsay; &#145;I know I injure him and perhaps destroy for ever my own tranquillity&#146;  (Hibbert, 51). The prince arranged the details of the marriage with Mrs Fitzherbert's uncle Henry Errington. On 3 November he wrote Mrs Fitzherbert an extravagant 42-page letter. She arrived in London early in December. The couple were then married in great secrecy in Mrs Fitzherbert's drawing room in Park Street on the evening of 15 December 1785 by one of the prince's chaplains in ordinary, the Revd Robert Burt, whose debts (of &pound;500) were paid by the prince to release him from the Fleet prison. The marriage was witnessed by one of her brothers, John Smythe, and Henry Errington. Reportedly a friend of Mrs Fitzherbert's, the MP Orlando Bridgeman, stood outside the doors to protect the couple against intruders. Afterwards the prince wrote out the marriage certificate: &#145;We the undersigned do witness that George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales, was married unto Maria Fitzherbert this 15th of December, 1785. John Smythe, Henry Errington, George P., Maria Fitzherbert&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, 1, frontispiece). The couple honeymooned, apparently at a house on Ham Common near Richmond.<h2>
<a name="Theprinceswife"></a>The prince's wife?</h2>Mrs Fitzherbert's arrival back in England and the mysterious circumstances surrounding her relationship with the prince turned her into a figure of controversy. She even helped to fuel a caricature boom. Few people outside her immediate family knew for certain that a marriage had taken place. The couple kept separate establishments, but the prince bought a house for her in Pall Mall, near Carlton House. Her appearances in public with the prince suggested that she had compromised herself. &#145;I know very little of her history, [no] more than that it is agreed on all hands that she is a very ambitious and clever woman,&#146; remarked the actress Sarah Siddons; &#145;it seems everything goes on with the utmost formality; provision made for children, and so on&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals and Correspondence of Thomas Sedgewicke Whalley</span>, 1.419). In February 1786 Horace Walpole reported that &#145;all ranks&#146; talked of the affair  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 33.514). It was also spoken of in court circles on the continent. The ambiguity in her position affected Mrs Fitzherbert's social standing. She was abandoned by her former husbands' families. In July she joined her husband in closing up her London house, as both were heavily in debt. They spent the summer at Brighton, where Mrs Fitzherbert rented a small villa close to the Marine Pavilion. Reportedly, the holiday was not a success. &#145;It is supposed that the place wd have been more frequented if people had not wish'd to avoid an intimate acquaintance with the lady or her lover&#146;, noted the bluestocking Elizabeth Montagu  (<span class="italic">Mrs Montagu</span>, 2.207).<br>
<br>In 1787 the prince pressed his political friends to settle his debts, though at the risk of grave hurt to himself and Mrs Fitzherbert. In the Commons on 20 April 1787 Alderman Nathaniel Newnham gave notice that he intended to introduce a motion on the prince's behalf. Three days later John Rolle hinted that if Newnham did not back down he would bring Mrs Fitzherbert into the discussion. On 30 April Charles James Fox&#151;speaking, so he said, from the &#145;immediate authority&#146; of the prince&#151;described the prince's marriage as nothing more than a &#145;miserable calumny&#146;  (Wilkins, 1.189, 190). He denounced the story of the marriage &#145;in toto, in point of fact as well as law. The fact not only never could have happened legally, but never did happen in any way whatsoever&#146;  (ibid., 1.194). Naturally his speech offended Mrs Fitzherbert. Fox, she later told Sir Philip Francis, had &#145;rolled her in the kennel like a street-walker&#146;; he knew &#145;every word&#146; he had uttered was &#145;a lie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis</span>, 2.452). Distraught, she immediately broke off relations with her husband. Subsequently the prince deputed Richard Brinsley Sheridan to make a mollifying speech in parliament on her behalf, which was notable for its tact and dexterity. It failed to pacify her, however, and it was not until he had made another suicide attempt that she agreed to return to him, although Fox was never forgiven. One happier and unexpected consequence of the drama in parliament was that she was more popular socially than at any time since her marriage. The &#145;knocker of her door was never still during the whole day&#146; following Fox's speech, she later reminisced to Lord Stourton  (Langdale, 123). Some of this support was prompted by the prince. According to Lady Sarah Napier, in June, he actually begged his friends to visit her.<br>
<br>During the Regency crisis of 1788&#150;9, Mrs Fitzherbert's relationship with the prince again exposed her to ridicule and danger. The pamphleteer Philip Withers published a rumour that she was corresponding with the &#145;Gros Abb&eacute;&#146;, one of the half-brothers of Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duke of Orl&eacute;ans, and that she was part of a secret Catholic cabal whose purpose was to subvert the government. Other, less absurd, rumours of infidelity were prompted by her intimacy with Sheridan. In public, at least, the prince distanced himself from Mrs Fitzherbert. &#145;I find it is a measure of the party to say that the Prince, from his amiable character, retains a friendship for Mrs Fitzherbert; but that she has not the least remaining influence; that he is quite tired of her, and in love elsewhere, therefore the public need have no further alarm on her account&#146;, reported Lord Harcourt  (Wilkins, 1.249). The prince sent Sheridan to Rolle in an attempt to forestall any further mention of his marriage in parliament. He failed. On 7 February Rolle moved an amendment to a clause in the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span>, which again alluded to Mrs Fitzherbert. Fox was at Bath on this occasion, but Charles Grey spoke on his behalf. He repeated Fox's declaration that the reports of the marriage were calumnious.<h2>
<a name="Separationandreconciliation"></a>Separation and reconciliation</h2>Mrs Fitzherbert was rarely the sole object of the prince's amorous attentions, in spite of his constant protestations. During the 1790s he embarked on several brief affairs. In 1795 she told the architect George Dance that she had lived the life of a &#145;Galley Slave&#146; for four years  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span> 2.293), though by then they had been parted for six months, so she may have exaggerated her unhappiness. In spring 1794 he had fallen in love with Frances Villiers, countess of Jersey (1753&#150;1821), who had persuaded him to marry his cousin Caroline of Brunswick. Mrs Fitzherbert spent the day of the prince's second wedding, 8 April 1795, at a rented mansion, Marble Hill Hall, near Twickenham in Middlesex. The mansion had once belonged to Henrietta Howard, mistress of George II. Presumably Mrs Fitzherbert was conscious of the irony. The impact upon her of the prince's desertion was profound. She remained affectionate towards him, however, and refused to be provoked into making use of their marriage certificate, which was in her possession, and of the many compromising letters that he had sent her. The prince claimed, probably unjustly, to have been misused in some way, though his sentiments towards her remained warm, and on several occasions during the following few years he made attempts to persuade her to return to him. On 10 January 1796, afraid that he was about to die, he wrote an extraordinary, passionately written will, ignoring Lady Jersey and his German-born wife, and naming Mrs Fitzherbert as practically his sole beneficiary. Both of them, he claimed, had been calumniated by &#145;<i>base, vile &amp; scandalous wretches</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George, Prince of Wales</span>, 3.133). On a later occasion he again threatened suicide. If Mrs Fitzherbert did not return to him, it would, he said, be the only course left to him.<br>
<br>This and similar avowals appear to have softened Mrs Fitzherbert towards the prince and during the summer of 1799 she agreed at least in principle to return to him. Her final determination depended on her church, however, for which reason a messenger was dispatched to Rome. Fortunately for the prince, the Vatican told her that she was the prince's canonical wife and should return to him. By the end of the year they appear to have been on good terms again. On 16 June 1800 they were formally reunited at a public breakfast at her Tilney Street house. &#145;She hardly knew how she could summon resolution to pass that severe ordeal&#146;, she told Lord Stourton, &#145;but she thanked God she had the courage to do so&#146;  (Langdale, 129). He added that the &#145;next eight years were, she said, the happiest of her connection with the Prince. She used to say that they were extremely poor, but as merry as crickets&#146;  (ibid.). From 1801 to 1806 Mrs Fitzherbert was much preoccupied with the fate of Mary (Minney) Seymour, the daughter of Lord Hugh and Lady Horatia Seymour, whom she had virtually adopted. In 1801 Minney's parents died and their executors moved to reclaim the child. The prince put together his own plan for the child's future welfare, and offered assurances that she would be educated as a protestant. The anxiety affected Mrs Fitzherbert's health. She was &#145;so totally wrapped up [in] and devoted&#146; to Minney that she would not bear the pain of losing her, she told the child's uncle Lord Robert Seymour  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Leslie, 126). A lengthy court case began in 1803. The prince took the fight to the House of Lords, and in June 1806 he reached a compromise with the executors under the terms of which Minney would remain with Mrs Fitzherbert, but under the sole guardianship of the child's eldest paternal uncle, Francis Ingram-Seymour-Conway, second marquess of Hertford. This was carried without a division. Thereafter Minney remained with Mrs Fitzherbert until 1825, when she married Colonel George Dawson, the second son of John Dawson, first earl of Portarlington.<h2>
<a name="Finalbreakwiththeprince"></a>Final break with the prince</h2>In the autumn of 1806 the prince embarked on an affair with Lord Hertford's wife, Isabella, and Mrs Fitzherbert's intimacy with the prince once more declined. For a while her status puzzled observers. During the height of his infatuation with Lady Hertford he treated Mrs Fitzherbert contemptuously. At other times he assured her that he still loved her. Eventually Mrs Fitzherbert tired of the prince's repeated declarations. On 18 December 1809 she refused an invitation to join him at the Marine Pavilion, citing the &#145;very great incivilities&#146; she had received there  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Leslie, 133). The final break occurred eighteen months later, in June 1811, over the seating arrangements for a f&ecirc;te at Carlton House. Denied her customary seat at the prince's table, Mrs Fitzherbert preferred not to go at all. Thereafter they saw very little of each other. In 1814 Mrs Fitzherbert wrote to the prince requesting an increase in her income. In 1810 the prince had increased her annuity from &pound;3000 to &pound;6000; in 1820 he raised it again, to &pound;8000, and again in 1830, to &pound;10,000. She spent much of her time during these years at Brighton, where according to John Wilson Croker she was treated like royalty. &#145;They don't quite <i>Highness</i> her in her domestic circle, but they <i>Madam</i> her prodigiously, and stand up longer for her arrival than for ordinary folks, and in short go as near to acknowledging her for <i>Princess</i> as they can, without actually giving her the title&#146;  (<span class="italic">Croker Papers</span>, 1.124). She is supposed to have had some sympathy for the prince's estranged wife, Caroline; during Caroline's &#145;trial&#146; for adultery in 1820, she remained in Paris, fearful that Henry Brougham would subpoena her. She wrote to the prince during his final illness in 1830, but does not appear to have received a reply. Probably he was too ill. During his illness he wore a miniature of Mrs Fitzherbert around his neck. It was buried with him. Subsequently the duke of Wellington and William Charles Keppel, fourth earl of Albemarle, burnt most of her correspondence with the prince. She did, however, reserve some documents to herself, which were deposited at Coutts. Among them were the prince's marriage certificate of 1785 and his will of 1796. Apparently William IV offered to make her a duchess as a recompense for the difficulties she had suffered on his brother's behalf. Mrs Fitzherbert replied that &#145;she had borne through life the name of Mrs Fitzherbert; that she had never disgraced it, and did not wish to change it&#146;  (Langdale, 138). She travelled widely in old age, often for her health, and as late as 1835 paid a visit to Paris. She died at her home, 55 The Steyne, Brighton, on 27 March 1837, and was buried in St John the Baptist's Church, Brighton, on 6 April.<br>
<br>In her late teens and early twenties Mrs Fitzherbert was a short, good-looking woman, smooth-skinned and fat, her hair a mass of golden curls, and &#145;perfectly unaffected and unassuming in her manners&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Mary Frampton</span>, 13). She became obese in later life. The caricaturists emphasized her large Roman nose and ample bosom. Unlike most of the prince's other women friends, she was not a sparkling society figure. Most of her intimate friends appear to have been Catholics. She was shocked at Charles James Fox's marriage to the former courtesan Elizabeth Armitstead and was &#145;all for&#146; Lady Nelson in her battle with Lady Hamilton. Yet she was not malicious. &#145;Poor Creature! I am sorry for [Lady Hamilton] now, for I suppose she is in grief&#146;, she remarked on hearing of Nelson's death  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 71). She was a great card player. In politics, if she had any affiliation at all, she seems to have been a moderate whig, caring little for Devonshire House, but supporting the prince in most of his political undertakings. Her dislike of Fox influenced the prince when he indicated that he would retain Addington in office in the event of a regency in 1801. According to Lord Stourton, the prince asked her for her advice at the time of the unrestricted regency in 1811, and she encouraged him to call on the services of his old whig friends: &#145;Only retain [the whigs], Sir, six weeks in power. If you please, you may find some pretext to dismiss them at the end of that time; but do not break with them without some pretext or other&#146;  (Langdale, 143). Like the prince she was closely identified with the charitable effort on behalf of the French &eacute;migr&eacute;s. She was cautious on the subject of Catholic emancipation. She was a close friend of the prince's brother Frederick, duke of York, with whom she carried on a long and candid correspondence. Few of their letters survive. During her years with the prince she was often in debt&#151;the consequence, she claimed, of the prince's extravagance. The numerous stories that she had a child or children by the prince have not been proved; they remain, however, suggestive. The most plausible candidate is Mary Anne or Marianne Smythe (<i>d</i>. 1859), officially the daughter of her brother John, and who would have been born after the 1800 reconciliation. She married Edward Stafford-Jerningham (1804&#150;1849), son of George Stafford-Jerningham, second Baron Stafford, and had descendants. When urged by Mrs Creevey to write her autobiography Mrs Fitzherbert replied that the details &#145;would break her heart&#146;  (<span class="italic">Creevey Papers</span>, 71). &#145;She said she supposed it would [be written] some time or other, but with thousands of lies; but she would be dead and it would not signify&#146;  (ibid.). For many years after her death Mrs Fitzherbert's marriage to the prince of Wales continued to provoke controversy, and it was not until 1856, with the publication of Charles Langdale's <span class="italic">Memoirs of Mrs Fitzherbert</span> (which contains his brother Lord Stourton's narrative), that a more or less accurate account of that event was published. Later biographers, particularly W. H. Wilkins and Shane Leslie, have added additional anecdotal details to her life. All are to some extent vindications.<br>
