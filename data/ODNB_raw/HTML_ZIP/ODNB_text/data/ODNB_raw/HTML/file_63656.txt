<span class="headword">Bolton,  Theophilus</span>  (1677/8&#150;1744), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Cashel</span>, was born in co. Mayo, Ireland. Nothing is known of his parentage or schooling but by 1695 he was a scholar of Trinity College, Dublin, from where he graduated BA in 1698 and MA in 1701. He was ordained deacon in the diocese of Dublin in 1702 and was priested in the following year. His first known ecclesiastical preferment was to the prebend of Monmahenock in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, in 1707, which he resigned later in the same year for the prebend of Stagonil, and he remained in St Patrick's until 1722, exchanging his prebendal stall in 1714 for that of the chancellor, a position which he held together with the rectory of St Werburgh's, Dublin.<br>
<br>While in St Patrick's Bolton continued his studies in Trinity College; he obtained the degrees of BD and DD in 1716. His growing reputation as a canon lawyer caused antagonism between him and the dean of St Patrick's, Jonathan Swift, who in 1717 wrote that Bolton &#145;has taken every opportunity of opposing me, in the most unkind and unnecessary manner&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.393). However, his abilities were recognized by William King, archbishop of Dublin, who made Bolton his vicar-general in 1721, appointed him precentor of Christ Church Cathedral in 1722, and was instrumental in securing for him the bishopric of Clonfert, for which Bolton was consecrated on 30 September 1722 in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. Unusually for the times, Bolton chose to reside in his diocese and while in Clonfert he seems to have made his peace with Swift, who visited him in 1723: the dean's report that &#145;the Bishop has made, in four months, twelve miles of ditches from his house to the Shannon&#146;  (ibid., 3.173) was the first indication of Bolton as an improver.<br>
<br>Bolton's period in Clonfert, however, was short, for in April 1724 he was translated to Elphin and in January 1730 was appointed archbishop of Cashel, despite the earlier opposition of the primate, Hugh Boulter, who in 1727 had advised that Bolton's translation to Cashel would be against the English interest. Bolton had opposed the government in 1724, when it sought to discover the identity of the author of the <span class="italic">Drapier's Letters</span>, and he was to do so again in 1728, when he organized opposition to a bill to prevent abuse of the parliamentary privilege of immunity from arrest. He was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; and long-time friend of William Conolly, the influential speaker of the Irish House of Commons, who favoured the appointment of Irishmen to Irish offices, and was suspected by Boulter of seeking to establish himself as the head of an Irish interest in parliament. His appointment to Cashel was not due to a lessening of Boulter's suspicion of him but to the happy coincidence of the sees of Dublin and Cashel being vacant at the same time, so allowing Bolton's translation to Cashel in return for the acceptance of the appointment of an Englishman, John Hoadley, to Dublin.<br>
<br>In Cashel, Bolton built a new palace, drained the extensive swamps to the west of the city, provided a public water supply, improved the way to the cathedral, and announced his intention to lay out &pound;1000 in repairing the fabric. However, his most enduring legacy to Cashel was the creation of the library, which still bears his name. Following the death of Archbishop King in 1729 he had acquired about 6000 volumes from King's collection. These, with his own books, formed the nucleus of the library, which he housed in a two-storey building beside his palace. The collection is rich in law and theology, reflecting Bolton's academic background, but, despite his intellectual training and the convenience of a library, he published only a few sermons. By May 1735 his energies seemed exhausted and he wrote to Swift that &#145;a good bishop has nothing more to do than to eat, drink, grow fat, rich and die; which laudable example, I propose for the remainder of my life to follow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 5.173); thereafter little was heard of him. Bolton died on 31 January 1744, aged sixty-six, and was buried in St Werburgh's Church, Dublin, on 2 February. In his will he bequeathed his library for the use of the archbishop of Cashel and the clergy of the diocese for ever.<br>
