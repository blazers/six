<span class="headword">Turges <span class="st"> [Sturges]</span>,  Edmund</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1445), <span class="occ">composer</span>, is of obscure origins. Nothing is known about his parentage or the circumstances of his birth or death; his surviving music is found in manuscript sources of <i>c</i>.1500&#150;1520. In 1469 he was established in the London area and was admitted to membership of the fraternity of St Nicholas, a guild of parish clerks and professional musicians working in the collegiate and parish churches of London and its immediate environs. From this a birth date of about 1445 may be inferred. It is just possible that he may be identified with one Sturges who was a chaplain of the choir of New College, Oxford, during 1507&#150;8. Since he composed secular as well as sacred music, it is equally possible that he spent much or most of his career in the employment of aristocratic families whose records have perished, composing sacred music for the chapel and secular music for entertainment.<br>
<br>Turges is not known to have served in the Chapel Royal, but the texts of two of the four songs attributed to him in the Fayrfax book suggest contact with the royal family. In &#145;Enforce yourselfe as Goddis Knyght&#146; an unnamed king (almost certainly Henry VII) is urged to uphold the rights of the commons against &#145;all mysdone thinges&#146;. The carol &#145;From stormy wyndis and grevous wethir&#146; prays for the protection of &#145;Arthur oure prynce&#146;, perhaps on a sea voyage or other hazardous journey. Composition may have been prompted by the departure of Arthur and Katherine of Aragon for their court at Ludlow as prince and princess of Wales in December 1501. The prayer is, however, for Arthur exclusively, and possibly the &#145;stormy wyndis and grevous wethir&#146; are to be understood metaphorically. This carol was apparently sufficiently admired for John Browne to use melodic material from it in his fine votive antiphon <span class="italic">Stabat iuxta Christi crucem</span>, composed about 1502.<br>
<br>Turges has never enjoyed the reputation of, for example, Robert Fayrfax (<i>d</i>. 1521) or John Taverner (<i>d</i>. 1545); nevertheless, his work is accomplished, and sometimes striking. The five-voice <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> in the Caius choirbook is exceptionally extended and contains passages that are extremely busy rhythmically, even in terms of the florid style of much contemporary English music. The five-voice setting of the Marian antiphon <span class="italic">Gaude flore virginali</span> (in the Eton choirbook) gives unusual prominence to boys' voices; if the composer was indeed ever a chaplain of New College, he may have designed it specifically for its chapel choir, with its many boys and few men. The work contains several phrases that seem to recall melodic material from &#145;From stormy wyndis&#146;. It may have been intended to compliment Prince Arthur if it belongs to the short period between the writing of &#145;From stormy wyndis&#146; and Arthur's death in April 1502, or to commemorate him if it dates, for example, from Turges's possible stay at New College. A four-voice setting of <span class="italic">Gaude flore virginali</span> also exists; this can be sung by men only, as can a three-voice <span class="roman">Kyrie</span> and <span class="roman">Gloria</span> by &#145;Edmund Sturges&#146; in the Ritson manuscript.<br>
<br>Much music by Turges has been lost. The Eton choirbook once contained three four-voice settings of the <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>]. &#145;Turges massys and antems&#146; appeared in partbooks belonging to King's College, Cambridge, in 1529; as six-voice works they must have been among the composer's most ambitious. While it is possible that these were by Edmund Turges (<i>b</i>. 1506), fellow of King's from 1526 to 1535, this is unlikely, not least because the repertory of the partbooks generally suggests composition before the 1520s.<br>
