<span class="headword">Eastry,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1331), <span class="occ">prior of Christ Church, Canterbury</span>, was born to unknown parents, probably in the village of Eastry, Kent, as his name indicates. While still a young man he entered the Benedictine priory of Christ Church, Canterbury. Over the next few years he gained considerable administrative experience, serving first as a member of the household of Archbishop Robert Kilwardby (<i>d</i>. 1279), and later as warden of the priory's Essex manors and as treasurer for two terms. In 1285 he was elected prior after the resignation of the incompetent Thomas of Ringmere, and he remained in charge for the next forty-six years. Finding the priory heavily in debt he drew up a plan for reducing household expenses and delegated a greater measure of control, especially for the collection of arrears, to the monk&#150;wardens of the priory estates.<br>
<br>By the 1290s the priory's financial base was secure enough to enable Eastry to invest in the local land market and, after the expulsion of the Jews, to acquire the former Jewish tenements in the city of Canterbury. But the election of Archbishop Robert Winchelsey (<i>d</i>. 1313), in 1293, and the outbreak of war with France and Scotland in 1294 and 1296 respectively, imposed new strains on the priory's resources. In early 1297 the monks' support of Winchelsey in his struggle with the crown caused them to be temporarily driven out of their house and they had to watch their grain rot in their granary. Eastry, however, reduced expenses, spending scarcely anything on the purchase of land and rents, or rebuilding, and halving the convent's expenditure on wine and grain. Later high grain prices, at a time of excellent harvests, allowed the treasurers to build up a substantial surplus. By the end of 1299 the priory had nearly one year's revenue in hand.<br>
<br>This surplus revenue financed agricultural improvement and extensive rebuilding at both a local and central level. Under Eastry's direction the priory poured substantial sums into increasing the size of sheep flocks and cow herds. In addition, on some manors, the liberal application of marl made possible an extension of the area under wheat. The priory also invested in the construction of new wind-, water-, and fulling mills. The building of sea walls helped to protect its marsh manors from flooding. On the manors themselves new barns, halls, and chapels were erected, and in the house at Canterbury Eastry renovated the choir and chapter house, as well as the prior's own apartments. During the first thirty-seven years of his rule, he was said to have spent no less than &pound;839 on &#145;new works&#146; within the cathedral precincts. In the area of urban investment Eastry exploited opportunities more intensively than anyone before him. He increased the priory's rents within the city of Canterbury by building nine stone shops in the Burgate, and by purchasing other property. He also built fourteen new shops at the priory's London property of Southwark. These achievements are recorded in a magnificent collection of documents&#151;correspondence, registers, a memorandum book, and innumerable local accounts.<br>
<br>Within the convent, Eastry had difficulties keeping the monks within the strict confines of the Benedictine rule. Winchelsey, after his first visitation in 1298, complained that brothers were living too well, wearing silks and rich furs, and eating too much meat. A few years later, he complained that the monks had been given permission to leave the monastery and wandered round the countryside on the pretext of making pilgrimages. In the 1320s Archbishop Walter Reynolds (<i>d</i>. 1327) reiterated these complaints, stressing that the monks should be spending more time in their celebration of divine office. Finally, towards the end of his life, Eastry's authority was challenged by a small group of discontented monks, who sent letters and a list of grievances to both the archbishop and the pope. It is not clear how widespread their support was. In 1317 Eastry publicly cleared himself of charges of abstracting and secreting letters destined for the chapter and for failing to pay a promised pension. In the 1320s the accusations surfaced again, and Eastry sequestered their suspected author, Robert Aledon, for several years. His charges appear to have been totally unfounded.<br>
<br>So far as national affairs were concerned, Eastry attended several royal parliaments and ecclesiastical conventions. During the political unrest of Edward II's reign Eastry sought to restore tranquillity to the realm. He co-operated with Archbishop Reynolds and they wrote to each other constantly. In the years 1325&#150;7 they were greatly concerned about the rumours of a French invasion and the possibility of open strife between Edward II and Queen Isabella. Both prelates were anxious not to antagonize either party, but their pleas for order, at a time of political violence and uncertainty, went unheeded. Nor was Eastry any more successful in maintaining peace at home. In his treatment of others he could be haughty, dictatorial, and overbearing. His tenants at Sandwich were ousted from their houses, and at one point the citizens of Canterbury rose in revolt and threatened to blockade the monks. None the less, he did succeed in maintaining the rights of the convent, and on his death in April 1331 he left the priory a considerable estate of books, vestments, plate, and horses. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral.<br>
