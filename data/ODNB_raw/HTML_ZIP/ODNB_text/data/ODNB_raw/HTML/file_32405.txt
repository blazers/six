<span class="headword">Cholmondeley,  Hugh</span>, third Baron Delamere  (1870&#150;1931), <span class="occ">settler in Kenya and politician</span>, was born in London on 28 April 1870, the only son of Hugh Cholmondeley, second Baron Delamere (1811&#150;1887), and his second wife, Augusta Emily (<i>d</i>. 1911), eldest daughter of Sir George Hamilton Seymour. He was educated partly at Eton College, where he proved difficult to discipline, and partly at a tutorial establishment. His father died when he was seventeen, he thereby inheriting the family estate at Vale Royal, Cheshire. After a brief spell of military service with the Cheshire regiment and the Cheshire yeomanry, Delamere began the organization of big-game shooting expeditions into eastern Africa. At the end of the fifth of these, in 1897, he crossed from northern Somaliland through Ethiopia into the north of the East Africa Protectorate (later Kenya). He was the first Briton to enter the territory from the north, and the beauty and the apparent agricultural possibilities of central Kenya deeply impressed him.<br>
<br>Delamere returned to Vale Royal but revisited the protectorate again in 1899, and in 1902, finding English country life dull, decided to settle and farm in the future Kenya. His decision coincided with the policy of the British commissioner, Sir Charles Eliot, that the economy of the territory would be best developed by white settlement. Agricultural wisdom of the time held that such development must be in large land units and to the new and inexperienced colonial administration it appeared that vast areas of attractive land were unoccupied, with the African peoples incapable of putting them to use.<br>
<br>Delamere was not the founder of white settlement, but that settlement very much bore the mark of his personality. The style of white settlement was his&#151;baronial, pioneering, but exuberant, living life to the full, and frequently to excess, in social behaviour. For such a society Delamere was the natural leader. He had, or was able to raise, funds for agricultural experimentation and he possessed a sharp intellect, quick in debate, and an autocratic and often volcanic temperament which, combined with influential connections in England, powerfully challenged the colonial establishment. Above all he believed that Kenya was destined to be developed as a &#145;white man's country&#146;.<br>
<br>Delamere first purchased, on the 99-year-lease system in place at the time, an estate of 100,000 acres in the Njoro area, with the intention of sheep ranching; this proved a failure, as did his next project, cattle ranching. Wheat proved more successful, but in all three projects Delamere invested heavily in experimentation and only after a decade was he able to extend his activities with further land purchases. Of these the most notable was at Soysambu where he was able to breed merino sheep on a large scale. The numerous uncertainties of African agriculture, and, at the end of his life, the worldwide economic depression, prevented his ever becoming very wealthy. Delamere married first, in July 1899, Lady Florence Cole (1878&#150;1914), fourth daughter of the fourth earl of Eniskillen; they had one son. His first wife died in 1914 and on 28 May 1928 he married Gwladys Helen (<i>d</i>. 1943), daughter of Rupert Evelyn Beckett and the former wife of Sir Charles Markham.<br>
<br>Delamere's political career began in 1903 when he was elected chairman of the first settler farmers association; in 1907 he was nominated to the territory's first legislative council. During the early months of the First World War he acted as an intelligence officer in the border area between the protectorate and German East Africa. The work was both testing and dangerous, Delamere's health suffered, and he had to return to England for recuperation. In 1917, after return to the territory, he was elected to the governor's war council, a body created to co-ordinate the colony's war effort. After the war, elections, on a European men and women franchise, were held for the European settler members of the legislature, Delamere being elected for the Rift Valley constituency in 1920. He retained this seat until his death, though ill health forced a temporary resignation in 1929.<br>
<br>Delamere's political objectives remained constant: the building of a &#145;white man's country&#146;, by reservation of the highlands together with selected urban areas for Europeans, and pressure on the government to ensure, by harsh measures, that the white community could draw on a supply of cheap African labour until such time as a white working class had been established. In the years before 1914 he led the settler opposition to a proposal to settle Jewish refugees and exiles in the territory. In the years immediately after the First World War he championed the settler resistance to the claims of Kenya's Indian community for full equality of citizenship, common roll elected members of the legislature or parity with the number of European members, the ending of segregation, and free immigration. In a charged atmosphere, with militant settlers talking of a coup, Delamere headed a European settler delegation to London. The final settlement, declaring Kenya primarily an African territory, ended Delamere's hopes for a Rhodesian-style white dominion, but nevertheless secured the European settlers in the highlands, giving them such powerful representation in the legislature that the general pattern of colonial rule became that of &#145;government by agreement&#146; (officials and settlers) for the remainder of the 1920s, Delamere becoming a member of the executive council. In these years Delamere's principal political activities became centred on creating a union of the three east African territories, a union to be dominated by the white settlers of Kenya and Tanganyika. Predictably the governments of Uganda and Tanganyika could not accept any such project, though the debate on some form of union was to continue long after Delamere's death in 1931.<br>
<br>As strong a personality as Delamere's inevitably aroused criticism, even among the white settlers, where he was attacked as representing only the large landowners, and also over some of his own land dealings. The secretary of state ordered two inquiries which nevertheless afforded him some defence.<br>
<br>Delamere's career is remarkable as an unusual case of a single individual outside the official colonial hierarchy having so great an impact on the life and style of a colony. His political views and ambitions were of course those of a settler at a time of almost total colonial self-confidence. They should not obscure Delamere's massive and lasting contribution to Kenya's economic development, with experimentation in particular with rust-resisting wheat, support for new flour milling, creamery, and other processing industries, and personal generosity to new settlers opening up land for commercial use. That these assets may have passed later into the hands of others does not belittle his work.<br>
<br>As a man, Delamere suffered from poor health; he arrived at his Njoro estate on a stretcher. Pain from riding accidents and malaria, and damage to his heart from his war service told heavily on him. The last months of his life were clouded by the appointment from London of a new and strong governor, Sir Joseph Byrne, who was not prepared to follow the &#145;government by agreement&#146; policy. Delamere died of angina at Loresho, near Nairobi, on 13 November 1931. He was buried at Soysambu. He had been made KCMG in 1929. Until Kenya's independence, the main thoroughfare of Nairobi was named Delamere Avenue, and a statue of him stood at one end of the avenue. After independence the avenue was renamed and the statue removed.<br>
