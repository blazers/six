<span class="headword">Delderfield,  Ronald Frederick</span>  (1912&#150;1972), <span class="occ">writer and playwright</span>, was born on 12 February 1912 at 37 Waller Road, New Cross, south London, the third of the four children of William James Delderfield (1873&#150;1956), a meat sales manager at Smithfield market and later a Devon newspaper proprietor, and his wife, Alice Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones, the only daughter of a Welsh tea trader, whose family had moved to London from Aberystwyth in the 1850s. In 1918 the Delderfield family moved from south London to 22 Ashburton Avenue in Addiscombe, near Croydon, then a quiet rural suburb on the Kent&#150;Surrey border. When he was eleven Delderfield was briefly enrolled at Selhurst grammar school, Croydon, which he disliked. The suburban world of Addiscombe would later provide the backdrop for Delderfield's first two major novels, <span class="italic">The Dreaming Suburb</span> and <span class="italic">The Avenue Goes to War</span> (1958). In 1923 the volatile James Delderfield inexplicably purchased the <span class="italic">Exmouth Chronicle</span>. The family moved to Devon and Delderfield was sent to complete his education at West Buckland, a nearby boys' boarding-school. This school was to be affectionately portrayed as Bamfylde, at the end of Delderfield's life, in his novel <span class="italic">To Serve them All my Days</span> (1972).<br>
<br>After a course at Fulford's Business School Delderfield, aged seventeen, became editor of his father's newspaper in 1929. Eleven years of journalism taught him his craft as a writer. At the same time, always prolific, he began writing full-length and one-act plays, some of which were staged for short provincial runs. On 14 March 1936 he married May (Marnie) Evans (<i>b</i>. 1905/6), a Manchester laboratory assistant whom he met on holiday in Wales. The couple adopted two children.<br>
<br>Delderfield did five years of peripatetic desk work in the RAF from 1940 because, severely short-sighted, he was deemed unfit for active service. <span class="italic">Worm's Eye View</span>, having been written in 1943, was staged in London in 1945. A comedy about the sufferings of wartime British servicemen at the hands of civilians, it ran in London for over five years until 1951. Of Delderfield's thirty or so published plays only <span class="italic">Worm's Eye View</span> is now remembered.<br>
<br>After the war the Delderfield family returned to Devon. There in 1956 he turned from writing plays to concentrate on novels and non-fiction. A lifelong fascination with Napoleonic times had already led to <span class="italic">Farewell the Tranquil Mind</span> (1950). <span class="italic">Napoleon in Love</span> was published in 1959, and there were several other books on this theme. <span class="italic">Bird's Eye View</span>, the first of four autobiographical works, appeared in 1954. He published a total of twenty-two miscellaneous short volumes of fiction and non-fiction.<br>
<br>But it is for his ambitious multi-volume sagas&#151;straightforward Dickensian or Galsworthian story-telling in which the historical and geographical setting is as vital as the characterization&#151;that Delderfield is best-known. Published from 1966 to 1968, the three-volume <span class="italic">A Horseman Riding By</span> tells the story of a Devon valley, its inhabitants, and its squire during the first two-thirds of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Delderfield's final and finest work, the Swann saga, began with <span class="italic">God is an Englishman</span> (1970), continued with <span class="italic">Theirs was the Kingdom</span> (1971), and ended with the posthumous publication <span class="italic">Give us this Day</span> (1973.) The Swann books tell the story of Adam Swann, who steals a valuable necklace from a dead Indian mutineer in 1857 and uses the capital to start a London-based nationwide haulage business. The narrative sweeps epic-like through all the major events of history as the nineteenth century gives way to the twentieth and the Swann children grow up and move, somewhat implausibly, around the world.<br>
<br>Never athletic, Delderfield was a heavy-set, myopic man who wore thick-lensed spectacles and who smoked heavily. He died from lung cancer at his home, Dove Cottage, Manor Road, Sidmouth, Devon, on 24 June 1972.<br>
<br>A number of Delderfield's novels were serialized for television. <span class="italic">A Horseman Riding By</span> was produced in 1977 and starred Nigel Havers as Paul Craddock. <span class="italic">To Serve them All my Days</span>, dramatized for the BBC by Andrew Davies and broadcast in 1981, featured Frank Middlemass as the headmaster Algy Herries. Delderfield's two-book love story <span class="italic">Diana</span> (1960 and 1962) was also serialized by the BBC in 1984.<br>
<br>Delderfield is remembered and respected as a story-teller rather than as a great novelist: &#145;as a purveyor of quality, classic realistic fiction for popular consumption, R. F. Delderfield has few peers&#146;  (Sternlicht, 134).<br>
