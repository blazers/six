<span class="headword">Maning,  Frederick Edward</span>  (1811/12&#150;1883), <span class="occ">writer and judge in New Zealand</span>, was born on 5 July 1811 or 1812 in Dublin, the eldest of the three sons of Frederick Maning of Johnville, co. Dublin, and his wife, Mary Barrett. Both his parents were from Anglo-Irish protestant families of moderate wealth. In 1824 the family emigrated to Van Diemen's Land, where they farmed for several years before moving to Hobart. However, Maning had no liking for town life, and in 1833 he left Van Diemen's Land to seek adventure and profit among the Maori of Hokianga harbour, an area rich in valuable kauri forest on the north-west coast of New Zealand. It was here that he was to spend most of the rest of his life.<br>
<br>At Hokianga Maning fitted easily into the frontier environment of scattered European establishments surrounded by and dependent on the patronage of powerful Maori tribes. He soon learned Maori and adapted readily to Maori ways necessary for economic survival. At first he ran a small trading establishment at Kohukohu, where he lived a rough, simple, often rather riotous life. According to a local missionary baptism register, he fathered a child to a woman called Harakoi while living there. Nothing else is known of the woman or child.<br>
<br>In 1839 Maning bought a block of land called Onoke at the mouth of the Whirinaki River. This was the territory of the Hikutu hapu (sub-tribe) and Maning soon became an important figure in that community, as the local trader, through his marriage in 1839 to Moengaroa and the birth of four children. He gained some notoriety shortly after moving to Onoke, when the new governor, William Hobson, attacked him in print for attempting to dissuade Hokianga Maori from signing the 1840 treaty of Waitangi.<br>
<br>As colonization increased Maning slowly abandoned his bicultural lifestyle. The northern war of 1844&#150;5 against Hone Heke made him feel less secure about his safety in a potentially hostile Maori world, and after Moengaroa's death in 1847 he began to distance himself from his Hikutu kin. In 1848 he expanded his trading activities, and, although these were initially successful, his eventual retirement from business in the early 1860s was accompanied by financial problems, stemming partly from the reluctance of Maori employees to work off debts.<br>
<br>It was the publication of his two books that brought Maning national attention. Both were initially published under the <i>nom de plume</i> the Pakeha-Maori (a name then applied to Europeans living with Maori tribes). <span class="italic">A History of the War in the North</span> (1862) was written from the supposed point of view of a Maori chief fighting against Hone Heke, and drew on Maning's extensive knowledge of the war and its Maori participants. It was well reviewed, and Maning was persuaded to complete quickly the more ambitious <span class="italic">Old New Zealand</span>. That was published in 1863, to considerable local and British acclaim. Using some of the literary devices of Laurence Sterne, Maning produced a racy, often very funny <i>tour de force</i> of autobiography, description, and discussion of Maori history and customs. Both books were published at the height of the New Zealand wars, and have an underlying theme warning fellow colonists that Maori would never willingly accept European domination. In 1865 Maning gained an appointment as one of the judges on the new Maori land court, set up to begin the task of individualizing title to all remaining Maori land. Until his retirement in 1876 most of his time was spent travelling around the Maori centres of the far north, although he was also brought south at times to help adjudicate several large and controversial land cases.<br>
<br>As he grew older Maning's alienation from all things Maori continued to grow. He resented Maori questioning of his court decisions and was contemptuous of the leaders of the new Maori protest movements emerging in the 1870s. In 1880 he had what seems to have been a nervous breakdown. Imagining among other things that his children and their Hikutu relatives were plotting to kill him, he fled Onoke to Auckland, where the comfort of private lodgings and the novelty of town life brought some contentment. In 1882 he sought treatment for cancer in London, and he died there on 25 July 1883. He was later buried in New Zealand, at the Symonds Street cemetery, Auckland.<br>
<br>For almost fifty years Maning was caught up in the turmoil of New Zealand race relations. However, it is on his brief career as an author that his fame now largely rests. <span class="italic">Old New Zealand</span> in particular has been frequently reprinted or anthologized and has become a classic of New Zealand literature.<br>
