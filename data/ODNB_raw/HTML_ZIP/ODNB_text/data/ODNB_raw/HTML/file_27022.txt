<span class="headword">Taylor,  Christopher</span>  (1614/15&#150;1686), <span class="occ">religious writer and schoolmaster</span>, was born in north Yorkshire, near the Westmorland border, possibly near Skipton, and was probably the son of Thomas Taylor, described as of Ravenstonedale, Westmorland. He matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, aged eighteen, on 22 March 1633 and graduated BA on 28 May 1636. According to John Whiting's <span class="italic">Persecution Exposed</span>, he served as a preaching minister until his conversion to Quakerism in 1652 by George Fox. Another source describes how in 1652 or 1653 William Dewsbury and Christopher's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27084/', "Thomas Taylor")</script> came to him, &#145;a Priest of a Chappell, called Chappell in the Bryers, betwixt Brighouse and Hallifax, who was convinced of the Truth, &amp; bore Testimony to it, and was Instrumental in Settleing a Meeting at Bradford&#146;  (Penney, 291&#150;2). In 1654 he was injured in an assault on his way to a Quaker meeting and between 1654 and 1656 underwent harsh treatment in Appleby gaol. His <span class="italic">The Whirl-Wind of the Lord</span> (1655) was a warning to the north in general and to Westmorland in particular. <span class="italic">A Warning from the Lord to this Nation</span> and <span class="italic">Certain Papers which is the Word of the Lord</span> are undated. In 1659 he was stabbed by a youth whom he had rebuked for vice. On 11 August 1661 he was imprisoned following his arrest at a Friends' meeting.<br>
<br>Taylor ran a school for Friends' children in Hertford, and when Fox opened a Quaker school in Waltham Abbey in Essex in 1668 he took over the headship, perhaps assisted by his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1685). On 1 July 1670 he appeared at the sessions in Chelmsford, charged with teaching school without a licence; in 1674 he was indicted for absence from parish worship. Taylor published <span class="italic">A Faithful and True Witness to the Light of Jesus Christ</span> and <span class="italic">An Epistle to Friends in the Truth</span> in 1675. In 1676, when he was enumerated among the Quaker &#145;First Publishers of Truth&#146; and also listed as of the Quaker meeting at Plaistow in Essex, he issued <span class="italic">The Counterfeit Convert Discovered</span>, as well as his Latin translation of a primer for Quaker children by George Fox and Ellis Hookes, <span class="italic">Institutiones pietatis</span>. In 1678 he was in Bristol. In 1679, the year that he was committed to prison for absence from parish worship, Taylor collaborated in producing a key to Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, <span class="italic">Compendium trium linguarum</span>, which used passages only from the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and not from classical texts, and published an account of a religious ecstasy that had gripped the children of his school, <span class="italic">A Testimony to the Lord's Power</span>. He moved with the school a few miles to Edmonton in Middlesex the same year. <span class="italic">A Testimony for Isaac Pennington and an Epistle of Caution to Friends</span> both followed in 1681, and <span class="italic">Something in Answer to Two Late Malitious Libels</span> in 1682.<br>
<br>Taylor left England for Pennsylvania in 1682, leaving the school in the charge of George Keith. Taylor represented Bucks county in the province's first assembly, was a member of the council of state until his death, registrar-general of the colony, and apparently a source of criticism of Penn. With his wife, a minister, Taylor became an architect of the structures of American Quakerism. He died and was buried in Philadelphia in 1686 and his &#145;Testimony concerning Thomas Taylor&#146;, his brother, was issued in a compilation in 1697.<br>
