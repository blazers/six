<span class="headword">Mason,  George</span>  (1735&#150;1806), <span class="occ">writer and book collector</span>, was baptized on 17 September 1735 at St Alban, Wood Street, London, the second son and fourth child of John Mason (1686&#150;1753/4), a wealthy malt distiller in Deptford, who on 23 February 1728 had married Amelia (<i>c</i>.1698&#150;1782), the illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28377/', "General George Wade (1673&#150;1748)")</script>. Two other children of this marriage, John (<i>b</i>. 1729) and Sarah (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1733), survived into adulthood; three died young.<br>
<br>Mason was admitted to the Middle Temple on 5 June 1752 and matriculated at Oxford from Corpus Christi College on 7 February 1753. By his father's will, proved on 19 January 1754, the distillery business, valued at &pound;15,000, and property in Deptford and Greenwich went to his brother John, who was charged to pay an annuity of &pound;500 p.a. to their mother. She was given a life interest in more valuable property in Hertfordshire, Essex, and Ormonde Street, London, all of which was to descend to George on her death; George also received &pound;8000 and Sarah &pound;5000. Their mother married on 20 November 1755 George Jubb (1718&#150;1787), later the regius professor of Hebrew at Oxford; she died on 4 February 1782, but long before her death (perhaps from the date of her remarriage or his majority a year later) George Mason had part ownership and use of the landed property bequeathed to her. He left Oxford without graduating, was called to the bar from the Inner Temple in 1761, became a manager of the Sun Fire Office in 1770, and lived comfortably at Porter's, Shenley, near St Albans, Hertfordshire, as a country gentleman, landscape gardener, and bibliophile. His anonymously published <span class="italic">Essay on Design in Gardening</span> (1768), intended to supplement the &#145;Unconnected thoughts on gardening&#146; in Shenstone's <span class="italic">Works</span> (vol. 2, 1764), shows familiarity with gardens in many parts of England, but refers to his own practice only in general terms. Its main theoretical concern is to draw a line between desirable contrast and undesirable incongruity.<br>
<br>In 1772 Mason and his mother, as joint owners, sold Porter's to Admiral Richard Howe, then Viscount Howe, and Mason went to live at nearby Aldenham, another of his estates. He became friendly with Howe, of whom he wrote a eulogistic <span class="italic">Life</span> (1803). His knowledge and his library contributed a little to Thomas Warton's <span class="italic">History of English Poetry</span> (1774&#150;81). In 1780 John Mason became insolvent. Funds inherited by their mother for the future benefit of both brothers went to pay his debts, and George, complaining of John's &#145;knavery&#146;  (Nichols, 4.554), was forced to retrench. He relinquished his coach, but continued to live at Aldenham Lodge and remained a keen collector of incunabula. His friend and neighbour, Georgiana, Countess Spencer, wrote in 1786 that Mason &#145;has but one good room in his house but that is a very Curious &amp; Valuable Library of chiefly Greek Latin &amp; Italien books&#146;. Rare early English works also in his collection included Pynson's original edition of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>, two early editions of <span class="italic">Le Morte d'Arthur</span>, and Caxton's <span class="italic">Blanchardyn and Eglantine</span>. A &#145;singular turn&#146; noted by Lady Spencer was that Mason planned &#145;to have a book printed in every year from 1467 to the present time&#146;  (BL, letters to Caroline Howe).<br>
<br>In 1793 &#145;a stroke on the forehead&#146; resulted in visual impairment and a &#145;perpetual debility&#146; in his &#145;tottering knees&#146;, from which Mason suffered for the rest of his life  (Mason, <span class="italic">Earl Howe</span>, 89&#150;90). He sought relief in electrical treatment, seemingly in vain. He also belatedly returned to authorship, evidently in quarrelsome mood. In 1795 he published a revised and greatly enlarged edition of <span class="italic">An Essay on Design in Gardening</span>, in which he now disparaged the gardening theories of Thomas Whately and Uvedale Price. Whately was dead but Price hit back in the second edition of his <span class="italic">Essay on the Picturesque</span> (1796&#150;8), to which Mason responded testily in 1798 with two appendices to his own <span class="italic">Essay</span>.<br>
<br>Mason assisted the antiquary William Herbert (1718&#150;1795) in revising Joseph Ames's <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities</span> (1785&#150;90), and in 1796 he published a creditable edition of Thomas Hoccleve's poems, selected from a manuscript in his possession, now in the Huntington Library. His finical correspondence with Samuel Pegge the younger (1733&#150;1800) about the notes and glossary for this edition is published in Nichols's <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>  (4.561&#150;70). He sold a considerable part of his library in four sales between January 1798 and April 1799, raising about &pound;2500, including &pound;73 10<i>s</i>. for a perfect copy of Dame Juliana Berners's <span class="italic">Boke of Haukyng and Huntyng</span> (1486). Dibdin comments that &#145;it must have been a little heart-breaking for the collector to have seen his beautiful library, the harvest of many a year's hard reaping, melting away piece-meal, like a snow-ball&#146;  (Dibdin, 419n.).<br>
<br>Mason's belligerent <span class="italic">Supplement to Johnson's English Dictionary</span> (1801), intended to rectify Johnson's &#145;palpable errors&#146; and supply his &#145;material omissions&#146;, received a hostile notice in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, to which Mason made a blistering reply in a supplement to his <span class="italic">Review of the Proposals of the Albion Fire Insurance</span> (1806), an attack on a commercial rival, disclaimed by Mason's fellow Sun Fire managers. This incongruous mixture of financier's and lexicographer's controversy was Mason's last publication. In it he implied that he was the author of letters signed &#145;Superior of the Jesuits&#146; which in 1771 &#145;put Junius to silence&#146;. These letters have not been traced; neither has <span class="italic">A British Freeholder's Answer to T. Paine</span>, attributed to Mason in Nichols's <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>  (4.551).<br>
<br>Mason never married. He died of apoplexy at Aldenham Lodge on 4 November 1806. He had settled Aldenham Lodge and other landed property on his brother John's son, Bryant. After other small bequests the residue of his estate went to Mrs Anna Maria Dalby, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carteret (<i>bap</i>. 28 Dec 1764), who, according to Nichols, was Mason's natural daughter. Bryant Mason and his son Frank were drowned on the way back from India in 1809.<br>
