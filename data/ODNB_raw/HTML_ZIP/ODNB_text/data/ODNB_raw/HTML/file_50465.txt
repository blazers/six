<span class="headword">Manners,  Arthur</span>  (1879&#150;1968), <span class="occ">brewer</span>, was born on 8 December 1879 at Stapenhill, Burton upon Trent, one of the nine children of William Posnette Manners (1846&#150;1915), brewer, and his wife, Clara Gothard. William Posnette Manners, son of a local draper, had joined the Burton brewers, Worthington &amp; Co., as an office boy at the age of sixteen. He quickly rose to be the firm's cashier and office manager, was appointed a director on the company's incorporation in 1889, and, following the death of William Henry Worthington (1826&#150;1894) five years later, became managing director and deputy chairman. He rapidly gained control of the company (by 1900 he held no less than 73 per cent of its equity) and under his astute leadership Worthingtons acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. By the outbreak of war, the company had regained much of its earlier standing, steadily eroding the market share of its arch rival Bass, Ratcliff, and Gretton. On Manners's death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (who joined the brewery in 1903) and Ernest. Arthur married and had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Arthur inherited all his father's entrepreneurial drive and ambition. Autocratic in style, he consistently refused to sanction trade unions within the firm. As the architect of the merger in 1927 of Worthingtons with Bass&#151;undertaken to resolve problems of over-capacity&#151;he was to prove more than a match for Colonel Sir John (later Lord) Gretton, the chairman and major shareholder of the larger company. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger (devised by Worthingtons' London advisers) were such that Manners became chairman and joint managing director of Worthingtons, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass; he had obtained a dominant position in both companies and enhanced his own financial status.<br>
<br>The amalgamation, described as &#145;the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry&#146;  (Hawkins, 90), failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by Manners and his family. He received the support of his brother Ernest until the latter's death in 1944 and during the 1930s and 1940s Arthur's three sons, Arthur Geoffrey, William, and Philip, were all appointed directors. After a minor dispute in 1945 which prompted the resignation of Lord Gretton, Manners replaced him as chairman and managing director of Bass.<br>
<br>By the late 1940s the Manners family provided no fewer than four of the company's six directors. However, despite the duplication at board level, the deep-seated rivalry between the firms persisted and there was little attempt to create a coherent entity. James Eadie &amp; Co., acquired in 1933, also maintained considerable autonomy. In the difficult post-war climate, this lack of rationalization was reflected in falling sales. Concern among institutional investors led to the appointment as a director in April 1953 of Sir James Grigg, a distinguished former civil servant and politician. Three months later, Manners retired.<br>
<br>Manners was never deeply involved in public life. He died at his home, Longford Hall, Longford, Derbyshire, on 13 January 1968, leaving an estate worth over &pound;2 million.<br>
