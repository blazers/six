<span class="headword">Bonython,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1580, <em>d.</em> 1647<span class="mult">x</span>54), <span class="occ">soldier and planter in America</span>, was baptized on 8 April 1580 at St Columb Major, Cornwall, a younger son and one of eight children of John Bonython and his wife, Eleanor Myleinton. Nothing else is known of his early life. He married by 1607 Lucretia Leigh, daughter of William Leigh and Phillippa Prest of St Thomas by Launceston, Cornwall. They had two sons and three daughters, of whom one son and two daughters lived to adulthood and married. On 29 February 1630 the Council for New England granted to &#145;Thomas Lewis and Capt. Ric[hard] Bonighton&#146; a substantial tract of land between Cape Elizabeth and Cape Porpoise on the coast of New England  (<span class="italic">York Deeds</span>, 2.110). Lewis had travelled to New England in 1628, and settled there permanently in 1631, but no record of Bonython is found in New England prior to 25 March 1636, when he served as a magistrate at Saco court. Bonython continued to serve in the various governments of the region which became Maine, holding office as councillor under Thomas Gorges in 1639 and 1640, and assistant in 1646. In 1645 he was made colonel-general of the militia in Saco.<br>
<br>Bonython was frequently associated with Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the leading promoter of New England colonization. In 1639 he was appointed to the council established by Gorges for his territory in New England, and in 1641 he attested to the earlier military service of Gorges. Bonython adhered to the Church of England, and opposed developing a New England church government. He died between 14 July 1647, when he was last recorded alive, and 29 June 1654, when his son John acted in his stead. The large tract of land granted to Lewis and Bonython in 1630 was in 1681 divided among the heirs of these two men, including representatives of the three children of Bonython.<br>
