<span class="headword">Atkyns, Sir  Edward</span>  (1587&#150;1669), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Hensington, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire, the son of Richard Atkyns and his wife, Eleanor Marsh. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 5 February 1601 and was called to the bar on 25 January 1614. In 1630 he became a governor of the society and two years later an &#145;autumn reader&#146;. Atkyns was the pivotal figure in a long line of distinguished jurists stretching over four generations. Both his grandfather (Thomas) and his father had been readers of Lincoln's Inn and both had been appointed to minor judicial office under the Tudors. In turn, Edward Atkyns's first marriage, to Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1644), daughter of Sir Thomas Dacres, produced three daughters and two sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/866/', "Sir Robert Atkyns (bap. 1621, d. 1710)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/863/', "Sir Edward Atkyns (1630/31&#150;1698)")</script>, both of whom likewise became readers of Lincoln's Inn and distinguished jurists under the later Stuarts.<br>
<br>Lincoln's Inn was something of a puritan stronghold in the early seventeenth century&#151;its active members included William Prynne and Henry Sherfield&#151;and Atkyns inevitably formed his closest associations within a tightly knit cohort of puritan benchers. Little is known about his early legal career. He appears not to have attracted much notice before 1633, when he appeared as defence counsel during the crown's famous Star Chamber prosecution of William Prynne, stemming from the publication of Prynne's <span class="italic">Histrio-Mastix</span>. Prynne typically left his lawyers little room to make a persuasive defence and Atkyns's contribution was accordingly limited. He was forced to argue simply that Prynne's genuine passion for his subject&#151;&#145;the common resort to stage plays and the great abuse that comes by them&#146;&#151;had led him into careless overstatement. In addition he argued that Prynne's intemperate language and bitter condemnations were often borrowed from other authors and were, in any event, meant to be taken generally rather than applied to any specific individual&#151;an attempt to exonerate Prynne on the charge of libelling the queen. Atkyns assured the court that in his long experience with Prynne as a fellow bencher in Lincoln's Inn he had never known him in his &#145;ordinary discourses&#146; to be either &#145;factious&#146; or &#145;seditious&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.570&#150;71). The court was not convinced but, despite the unfortunate outcome of Prynne's trial, Atkyns's sympathetic support may have led other puritans to seek his help in subsequent confrontations with the crown. In 1640 both Henry Burton and John Bastwick, notorious defendants (together with Prynne) before Star Chamber in 1637, petitioned the Long Parliament for relief and asked that Atkyns be appointed their counsel.<br>
<br>Atkyns's close association with this contingent seems not to have fatally damaged his standing with the crown. Charles I made him serjeant-at-law on 19 May 1640. On the face of it, the promotion seems curious, but in all probability it was offered as a favour to the earl of Salisbury. Atkyns had worked as a legal adviser to the earl from the mid-1620s and they appear to have forged a close patron&#150;client relationship; Atkyns named the earl his official &#145;patron&#146; for the swearing-in ceremonies. At this critical stage, just a fortnight after the abrupt demise of the Short Parliament, Charles I was attempting to solidify political and financial support among key members of his council (and among the aristocracy generally) and this would have been a small price to pay for Salisbury's continuing loyalty.<br>
<br>Though the evidence is entirely circumstantial, it does suggest that from this point Atkyns's career became closely tied to the earl's. Salisbury's decision to lend Charles &pound;10,000 in the late summer of 1640 may, in similar fashion, have led to the issue of a royal patent, on 7 October 1640, appointing Atkyns a baron of the exchequer. In the event the patent never passed the great seal and consequently was never acted upon. While there may have been many reasons for this, it too may have reflected nothing so much as the declining relationship between Salisbury and the king after the unsatisfactory outcome of negotiations with the Scots at Ripon in late October, to which Salisbury had been a party. Increasingly during 1641 Salisbury came to be seen as untrustworthy, as a parliamentary &#145;reformer&#146;, especially after August 1641 when both houses recommended that he be appointed lord treasurer, and anyone associated with him would have suffered accordingly.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of civil war Atkyns chose to stay in London and, because of Salisbury's patronage or because of his own professional (and puritan) credentials, was eventually named in the propositions for the Oxford treaty in February 1643 as a parliamentary candidate for elevation to the court of king's bench. The ultimate failure of the Oxford treaty precluded his appointment but over the next two years Atkyns was busily occupied, together with Salisbury and his two sons, as one of parliament's administrative assistants in Hertfordshire, serving on numerous county committees for the weekly and monthly assessments and for sequestration. He was eventually rewarded in October 1645 when parliament assumed to itself the right to fill vacancies on the common-law bench and appointed Atkyns baron of the exchequer. He would hold the post until the king's death in January 1649. Also in 1645, on 16 September, Atkyns married his second wife, Frances (1604?&#150;1704), daughter of John Berry of Lydd, Kent.<br>
<br>The violence of the revolution seems to have given Atkyns pause, at least temporarily. He initially refused to recognize the authority of the council of state and declined the offer of reappointment under the new government. He resigned his seat on 8 February. However, time and perhaps the influence of the earl of Salisbury, who himself became an enthusiastic convert to the Cromwellian regime, persuaded him to change his mind. By October 1649 he had accepted reappointment, this time to the bench of common pleas. He was subsequently reappointed by Cromwell on 19 January 1654, by Richard Cromwell on 29 September 1658, and despite refusing to take a reimposed engagement, by the returning Rump Parliament on 16 May 1659. Atkyns maintained a relatively high profile during the interregnum. He appears to have gained the confidence of Oliver Cromwell rather quickly and was called upon repeatedly to advise Cromwell and his council on a variety of issues and important cases. It was to Atkyns, for instance, that Cromwell turned for a critique of the nominated assembly's contentious legislation for relief of poor prisoners and creditors (which Cromwell had suspended) and it was Atkyns (together with Baron Thorpe) who drafted the replacement ordinance. He was also asked to deliver his opinion regarding the liability of an alien in the case of the brother of the Portuguese ambassador, who was to be tried in an English court for a murder committed on English soil. Atkyns answered in the affirmative and presided over the ensuing trial. He had already served on the high court of justice for the eastern counties to hear the trial of the Norfolk insurrection (December 1650) and was asked again, in June 1654, to serve as a justice, in the treason trial of John Gerard and others for plotting the assassination of Cromwell. This last assignment provoked Atkyns's only conflict with the Cromwellian regime. Atkyns refused to swear an oath supporting the ordinance which had created the high court the previous January (and therefore asked to be excused from serving) on grounds that the ordinance violated the laws of England to which he had previously bound himself. Specifically, he objected to the notion that these men would be tried for treason without benefit of jury. Precisely why this became &#145;a matter of great weight and concernment&#146; in 1654, when it apparently had not troubled his conscience in 1650 (the ordinances creating the respective high courts of justice were virtually the same in this regard) isn't clear  (<span class="italic">Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum</span>, 2.493, 917&#150;18). However, he was allowed to withdraw and his standing with the regime apparently remained unaffected by the incident.<br>
<br>Atkyns's close association with the republican governments had little appreciable effect on his prospects at the Restoration. Charles II's commitment to appointing qualified judges overrode the political reservations he must have had and Atkyns was created baron of the exchequer and knighted on 23 June 1660. His career during the next eight years was unremarkable. He did take part in the trial of the regicides in October 1660 and served as well, in April 1668, in the trial of Peter Messenger and the apprentices of Moorfields, which resulted in a dramatic broadening of the definition of treason, though the depth of Atkyns's contribution to either proceeding is unclear. He died on 9 October 1669 at Albury Hall, Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>On balance Atkyns seems to have been remarkably successful in negotiating the not inconsiderable hazards of a judicial career at mid-century. Like all of his colleagues on the bench he was inevitably forced to make awkward and troubling political choices, serving as he did the Caroline, revolutionary, and Restoration regimes in turn, but he appears to have done so with sufficient conviction and integrity that his career suffered few negative repercussions and his reputation as &#145;a grave and learned judge&#146; survived down to the nineteenth century.<br>
