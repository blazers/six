<span class="headword">Davies,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1807), <span class="occ">Independent minister and journal editor</span>, is a figure whose parentage and date of birth are unknown, but he was probably born at Llanybydder in Carmarthenshire. A student at the dissenters' academy in Swansea in 1786, he was ordained in 1787. His ministry began with two Independent churches, Capel Sul in Kidwelly and Pen-y-graig, near Carmarthen. In 1790 he moved to Holywell, Flintshire, to be the minister of the Independent church there.<br>
<br>Davies is remembered as the publisher and editor of the most radical Welsh language periodical of the 1790s: <span class="italic">Y Geirgrawn, neu, Drysorfa Gwybodaeth</span> (&#145;The Magazine, or, Treasury of Knowledge&#146;), a fourpenny monthly. Nine numbers were published between February and October 1796. The periodical covered the debate on the <span class="italic">Seren tan gwmmwl</span> (&#145;Star under a Cloud&#146;), a pamphlet written by John Jones in 1795 influenced by Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span> (1791). David Davies participated in the debate and defended the work of John Jones against its detractors. Paineite influence may also be seen in Davies's summary of the causes of the French Revolution. The poetry in the periodical had a distinct Jacobin tone, most notably &#145;Can Rhyddid&#146; (&#145;Poem on Liberty&#146;), a Welsh translation of the &#145;Marseillaise&#146;, which appeared in the May number. In a prefatory note, the author (probably Thomas Evans, Glyn Cothi) claimed that the song had inspired the &#145;invincible&#146; French forces and had wafted to Britain on the wings of a breeze. This was at a time when Britain and France were at war. The <span class="italic">Geirgrawn</span> was a well-produced periodical and there were no indications of financial problems. Its sudden end in late 1796 was almost certainly the result of threats from the authorities.<br>
<br>Davies was forced to leave Holywell for a few months during the winter of 1796&#150;7. His church may also have been perturbed by the political implications of their minister's work. They complained to the Independent Association at Denbigh in 1797 that his ministry had been ineffective for years, and &#145;the hearers are becoming thinner&#146;  (Jenkins, 30). Davies left Holywell in October 1800. His movements are not known between October 1800 and 1802. Some time in 1802 he became a minister at Welshpool. He was there for a short while and in 1803 he moved to the Stoneway church in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, where he ministered and also kept school. He was held in esteem by his congregation, and when he died at Bridgnorth in 1807 he was buried in the walls of his church.<br>
