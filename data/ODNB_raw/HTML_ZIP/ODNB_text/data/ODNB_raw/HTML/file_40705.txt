<span class="headword">Powys,  Theodore Francis</span>  (1875&#150;1953), <span class="occ">novelist and short-story writer</span>, was born on 20 December 1875 at the vicarage, Shirley, Derbyshire, the third child and third son of the eleven children&#151;who included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35598/', "John Cowper Powys (1872&#150;1963)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56994/', "Llewelyn Powys (1884&#150;1939)")</script>&#151;of the Revd Charles Francis Powys (1843&#150;1923), son of the Revd Littleton Charles Powys, rector of Stalbridge, Dorset. Theodore Powys's mother was Mary Cowper Johnson (1849&#150;1914), daughter of the Revd William Cowper Johnson, rector of Yaxham, Norfolk. The &#145;Cowper&#146; derives from the family of poet William Cowper; there was a distant Welsh strain in both sides of the marriage.<br>
<br>Charles Francis Powys became curate of St Peter's Church, Dorchester, Dorset, in 1879, and vicar of Montacute, Somerset, in 1885. Theodore Powys was educated at Hardye's School, Dorchester, and at Sherborne preparatory school, in Dorset, and then at Eaton House School, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, where he met Louis Wilkinson, a son of the master, who became a lifelong friend of the Powyses. After training Powys farmed near Sweffling, Suffolk, from 1895. In 1901 he retired to Studland on the Dorset coast to read and write, and moved inland to Chaldon Herring on the Dorset downs in 1904. On 19 April 1905 he married Violet Rosalie Dodds (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), the eighteen-year-old daughter of a local solicitor. They had two sons and later adopted a daughter.<br>
<br>There are Nietzschean undertones in Powys's early biblical commentaries, of which only <span class="italic">An Interpretation of Genesis</span> (1907) reached publication. Early in the century he turned to fiction, but none of it was published before 1923, although <span class="italic">The Soliloquy of a Hermit</span> (1918) carried an advertisement that a novel, <span class="italic">Mr Tasker's Gods</span> (1925), was forthcoming. Between 1923 and 1932 only one year did not see the issue of at least one title. Many of Powys's stories have never been published.<br>
<br>Powys is best known for the novel <span class="italic">Mr Weston's Good Wine</span> (1927), but <span class="italic">Mark Only</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Unclay</span> (1931) are also outstanding among his longer fictions. The most praised collection of his countless short stories is <span class="italic">Fables</span> (1929). The setting of most of the tales is an elemental Dorset, and the characters are elemental cartoons that interact against that background to convey allegories of the search for everlasting truths. Elaborate allusions drawn from Powys's wide reading play on deliberately down-to-earth village commonplaces in seemingly artless and often cryptic sentences. Much of the dialogue is in dialect. Powys had an eye for the bizarre and was a sardonic humorist. Although he read the freethinking literature of his time, he was never a rationalist and questioned all newfangledness. His personal values never strayed far from the evangelicalism of the rectory, and he was a persistent churchgoer.<br>
<br>Powys was of medium height, and darkish in his farming years, when he had a moustache. Later he was stocky, clean-shaven, and white-haired, his characteristic expression being that of one always ready to be amused. His talk, like his prose, was pithy and quirky. Powys had a stroke in 1937 and in 1940 moved to Mappowder, north Dorset. In 1953 his health worsened, and he died at his home, The Lodge, Mappowder, on 27 November of that year. He was buried in Mappowder churchyard, and was survived by his wife.<br>
