<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pole, Sir  William  de la</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1366), <span class="occ">financier and merchant</span>, was of unknown origins. Later tradition reported that he came from Ravenser, the principal harbour of the Yorkshire peninsula of Holderness, whose exposed position (it was later engulfed by the sea) led Edward I to create in 1293 a safer harbour at Kingston upon Hull (now Hull). But any knowledge of the family has been irreparably diminished by the destruction of its records during the peasants' revolt in 1381.<h2>
<a name="Firstventuresinfinance13171331"></a>First ventures in finance, 1317&#150;1331</h2>At the beginning of his career William was frequently recorded as acting with his brother <a name="cosubject_22457"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard  de la Pole</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1345), who was probably the older of the two. Initially the brothers were chiefly importers of Gascon wine, and from 1317 they were the deputies at Kingston upon Hull of the royal chief butler, purchasing wines for the king. Between 1321 and 1327 Richard was likewise a collector of royal customs there. Between 1321 and 1324 Richard and William were also chamberlains of Kingston upon Hull and financed the building of its walls, essential for protection against the Scots.<br>
<br>The accession of Edward III was followed in February 1327 by the resumption of the Scottish war. As the leading merchants of Kingston upon Hull, Richard and William de la Pole became permanently associated with the central government. In April 1327 Richard became the king's chief butler, a position he held until 1331. In June 1327 the exchequer excused him from accounting because he &#145;is busied about the provisions for the Scottish war&#146;  (Fryde, <span class="italic">William de la Pole</span>, 16). As Edward III's Florentine bankers were in temporary difficulties, in July the two brothers became for the first time major lenders to the crown. When on 29 August the Bardi were unable to pay for foreign mercenaries, William stepped in with a loan of &pound;2001. Between July 1327 and February 1329 the brothers provided &pound;13,482, not much behind the Bardi, who in 1327/8 advanced &pound;15,470. This first Pole venture into high finance netted them interest of 22 per cent. Their ability to compete with the largest Florentine bank was based on a capacity to borrow from other English merchants, who did not wish to lend directly to the king, but trusted the credit of the Pole brothers. In 1354 William admitted in the exchequer that his loans to the crown were financed by borrowing from other people.<br>
<br>The overthrow of the rule of Roger Mortimer in October 1330 did not lead (as T. F. Tout suggested) to the Pole brothers' disgrace. Richard appears among the squires of the royal household on the roll of liveries for Christmas 1330, unlike the partisans of Mortimer who were conspicuous by their absence. On 12 July 1331, however, Richard and William ended their partnership. The indenture of partition of their assets mentions a fortune of over &pound;11,200, equivalent to nearly a third of the royal direct tax imposed on the laity in 1332. In 1333, when English armies were invading Scotland, Richard again became the king's chief butler, and remained in the post until 1338. Married to Joan, whose surname is unknown, he was an alderman of London from 1330 to 1340, and was knighted by Edward III in 1340. In his will, in February 1345, he called himself merely citizen of London. After Richard's death, in August, William was one of his executors. Richard's son and heir, another William, was by then principally a Northamptonshire landowner.<h2>
<a name="Asmoneylenderandwoolmerchant13311337"></a>As moneylender and wool merchant, 1331&#150;1337</h2>The indenture of July 1331 shows that William controlled a major part of the partnership's capital and that loans to magnates and prelates had formed a notable feature of its business. Kingston upon Hull remained William's main base. In May 1331 Edward III changed it into an autonomous borough, and William was its first mayor, serving until 1335. In March 1333, on the death of the town's last royal warden, the brothers inherited all the royal properties there. William's share included the warden's great mansion, which became his residence. He later bought out the share of Richard's heir. In 1388 the revenues from Kingston upon Hull of William's heir, Michael, amounted to &pound;450.<br>
<br>Between 1333 and 1337 William de la Pole made an important contribution to the war against the Scots through loans and provision of armaments and other supplies. This was also the time when he was acquiring much property elsewhere in Yorkshire and in the palatinate of Durham. The purchases in the North Riding included estates in some of the best wool-producing districts, notably in Swaledale. All of his properties in the West and North Ridings, as well as his Durham estates, were aligned on, or near, the great northern road running through Yorkshire and continuing towards the Scottish border. They were so spaced that, on a journey between southern Yorkshire and Durham, Pole's agents could have stayed every night and stored their merchandise on his own lands.<br>
<br>Surviving remnants of Pole's business accounts highlight the reasons for his mercantile success. The commissions paid by him to agents buying wool were twice as large as those paid by other leading merchants. He practised economies of scale. In 1339/40, at Bruges, he hired eight warehouses for wool by disbursing &pound;100, which worked out, in terms of storage per sack, as costing even less than the rates he was paying in Kingston upon Hull, his native town. Pole's accounts were arranged in a uniquely efficient manner, every expense being recorded per unit of merchandise, so that the costs at every stage of a commercial operation could be analysed at a glance.<h2>
<a name="TheDordrechtschemeanditsconsequences13371341"></a>The Dordrecht scheme and its consequences, 1337&#150;1341</h2>The preparations, from 1336, for the war with France, which started openly in May 1337, created vast opportunities for William de la Pole. He probably originated the wool scheme for financing the war and became one of the two heads (together with the Londoner Reginald Conduit) of a wool company formed to run it. The scheme was practicable, if carried out according to plan, but this did not happen. It was ruined by the illicit practices of Pole's associates and by the impatience of the royal envoys in Brabant, where the money was needed to pay for the armies of Edward III's continental allies. The Wool Company, which enjoyed a monopoly of export, a right to purchase wool compulsorily on credit, and control over the revenue from the customs, was expected to ship to Dordrecht in Brabant 30,000 sacks of wool (average yearly exports) and advance &pound;200,000. Its members abused their powers of forcible purchase, thus prejudicing the assembling of the full amount, and smuggled at least 4400 sacks. In December 1337 the company offered to pay the royal envoys a third of what was promised, although if the smuggled wool had been disclosed, they could have offered at least half. The king's envoys then confiscated the whole consignment, precipitating the collapse of the scheme. By February 1338 Edward III had become convinced that Pole was chiefly responsible for this. The failure of the scheme ruined the timetable for financing Edward's two campaigns in the Netherlands (1338&#150;40), and condemned the king to months of penury during his first stay there (July 1338 &#150; February 1340). His allies, deprived of much of the promised money, delayed the invasion of France until it was too late to achieve anything.<br>
<br>Pole could afford to allow the collapse of the Wool Company, but many of his associates were seriously hurt. He started advancing immense loans single-handedly. Between June 1338 and October 1339 the king incurred debts to Pole amounting to &pound;111,156, of which &pound;100,770 were paid abroad. His rewards included the former London mansion of the Bardi in Lombard Street and the foolhardy purchase, for &pound;22,650, of the lordship of Burstwick, comprising much of Pole's native Holderness. This was the most valuable royal estate (about &pound;1000 a year) and Edward III, who only agreed to the sale because his need for money was desperate, never forgave Pole for forcing it upon him. Raised to the military rank of banneret, Pole sat among the peers of banneret rank in the parliament of October 1339, and was the second baron of the exchequer between November 1339 and June 1340.<h2>
<a name="Trialsandtribulations13411354"></a>Trials and tribulations, 1341&#150;1354</h2>Edward III's second expedition to the Netherlands (June&#150;November 1340) was even more disastrous financially. Pole's loans in 1340 were modest, but by November he had recovered 80 per cent of the debts owed to him. These two things together ruined him in the king's eyes. On his return to England on 30 November Edward III arrested officials and financiers deemed responsible for his misfortunes. He seized Burstwick and never returned it to Pole. As the two heads of the Wool Company, Pole and Conduit were tried between April and July 1341. The true charge was effectively a &#145;breach of contract&#146;, but smuggling of wool in 1337 turned it into a criminal prosecution. Confiscation of all possessions was decreed, and Pole was kept imprisoned longer than anyone else. He was released only in May 1342, and the proceedings were quashed, because his financial help was again needed.<br>
<br>Once more Pole showed his power to enlist the support of native and German merchants. In 1343, working entirely behind the scenes, he organized a new English company, which he effectively controlled until 1345. It was entrusted with the royal customs and could, on their security, borrow the vast sums needed by the king. Pole apparently invented a scheme to allow this company to buy up old royal debts at huge discounts. This took advantage, unscrupulously, of the king's partial bankruptcy. It enabled Pole to recover covertly some of the debts still due to him, presumably on less unprofitable terms. Royal debts amounting to at least &pound;84,000 were thus &#145;extinguished&#146; between 1343 and 1355. There were widespread malpractices, including forgeries of royal obligations.<br>
<br>In 1345, fearing that he might be swallowed by the bottomless whirlpool of royal war finance, Pole withdrew from the company he had covertly created. His successors efficiently financed the Cr&eacute;cy campaign and the prolonged but successful siege of Calais (1346&#150;7). The plague epidemic of 1348&#150;9 afterwards ruined these English financiers, but in November 1353 Pole successfully avoided any responsibility for their debts. This attempt to involve him in the bankruptcy of his former associates was part of a renewed royal attack on Pole. There was a growing and widespread reaction against the king's former financiers. Edward III could now afford to be independent of them, as the years 1350&#150;54 witnessed little warfare. The king could again directly exploit the customs, instead of having to pledge them in advance to bankers. The trial of 1341 was revived. The renewal of charges about the smuggling of wool in 1337 threatened Pole with complete ruin. He escaped it only by remitting all outstanding royal debts and renouncing his claims to Burstwick. But he was still allowed to retain a considerable fortune. In January 1366, five months before William's death, his eldest son and heir, Michael, a knight of the prince of Wales, received a personal summons as a parliamentary peer.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandfamilyfortunes"></a>Last years and family fortunes</h2>William de la Pole died on 21 June 1366 and was buried in the Carthusian church of St Michael at Kingston upon Hull, founded by his family. His widow, Katherine, lived in affluence until 1382, with a yearly income of nearly &pound;200. While his second surviving son, Edmund (<i>d</i>. 1419), founded a knightly family, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22452/', "Michael de la Pole")</script>, who in 1375 inherited the valuable East Anglian estates of his wife, Katherine Wingfield, was in 1385 promoted to the earldom of Suffolk. A century later, in 1484, his great-grandson, John de la Pole, earl of Lincoln, seems to have been informally recognized as heir to the throne by his uncle, Richard III. Had the outcome of the battles of Bosworth (1485) or Stoke (1487) been different, he might have become king of England.<br>
<br>William de la Pole's activities as an organizer of English merchant companies left a permanent mark on the English wool trade and royal taxation thereof. The transition from a free trade in wool to one controlled by a monopolistic company of English merchants of the staple, and the perpetuation of a large and lucrative royal tax on exported wool, were all developments connected with Pole's enterprises. Some momentous consequences followed. Wool exports began to decline, the English cloth industries expanded instead, and the makers of English woollen textiles were able to penetrate foreign markets in the Netherlands, Germany, and the Mediterranean.<br>
