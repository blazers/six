<span class="headword">Kerr, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1611), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, is first recorded in 1571 as captain to Adam Gordon of Auchindoun, brother to the fifth earl of Huntly, in one of the recurrent outbreaks of the bitter feud between the Gordon and Forbes families. After Auchindoun was victorious at Crabstane on 20 November, he sent Kerr to take possession of Corgarffe, the stronghold of Black Arthour Forbes in Towy; when Forbes's wife, Margaret, refused to surrender, Auchindoun authorized his captain to fire the building, leading to the deaths of the lady and her daughters. His action understandably gave Kerr a reputation for ruthlessness, preserved in the earliest versions of the ballad &#145;Edom o' Gordon&#146;, in which he appears as &#145;traitour Captaine Care&#146;  (Child, 3.430). In February 1573 Kerr was ordered to appear before Regent Morton as one of Auchindoun's agents, but on the 23rd he was comprehended, with the rank of captain, in the pacification of Perth. His relations with the Morton regime remained uneasy, and he was imprisoned in 1578.<br>
<br>Kerr's luck had improved by February 1583, when he was granted a remission as one of the sixth earl of Huntly's household servants. In the following year he served as a commissioner of parliament for Aberdeen. His increasing influence in local government was confirmed on 11 October 1585, when he held court in Inverness as lieutenant-depute, punishing all &#145;slayris of blak fische&#146; in Loch Ness  (Mackay and Boyd, 1.304). In May 1587 he joined the laird of Fentry and Mr David Maxwell in trying to persuade Chancellor Maitland to allow the eighth Lord Maxwell, recently sentenced to banishment, to remain in Scotland. Kerr also served as Huntly's intelligencer, intriguing with the Kerrs in the borders to obtain measurements for the walls of Berwick, ahead of a proposed attack upon them. Writing in September, William Ker of Ford in Northumberland described Kerr as having &#145;the chefe rule and credit about the Erle Huntlie&#146; and one who stood &#145;in good favour with the Kinge him selfe&#146;  (Bain, 1.270). Thomas Kerr forewarned the earl of two imminent attacks, one by a group of royal councillors (including Maitland) on 1 March 1589, and the other by the master of Glamis on 22 May.<br>
<br>As a burgess of Aberdeen Kerr was less well regarded, being among those complained of in 1591 during a civic dispute over the burgh's black and white friars' crofts. By April 1592 he and his brother James had been assigned to protect the countess of Huntly, the two men being her &#145;kinsmen and such as she greatly trusted&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1589&#150;93</i>, 669). Then in 1594 Kerr reappeared in a military guise, with a reactive strike against the seventh earl of Argyll, who had been authorized by the king to take the Gordon stronghold of Strathbogie; Kerr's stance led to his being declared a traitor, having compounded his offence by refusing to appear before the privy council on 4 November. Kerr subsequently avoided controversy for a while, and on 20 November 1600 he was knighted and promised the isle of St Kilda (Hirtha) in the Western Isles.<br>
<br>Kerr's apparent rehabilitation did not last long, for on 2 June 1601 the council ordered the marquess of Huntly (as the sixth earl had now become) to apprehend him for coining. After receiving a remission alongside his master in April 1603, he served as justiciar for Lewis on 18 July 1605 and was also one of four commissioners of fire and sword ordered to pursue and punish those inhabitants of the northern isles who had refused to surrender their castles and boats to royal officers. In 1610 Kerr received a formal charter for St Kilda, but he was unable to make the grant effective in the face of resistance by the Macleods of Dunvegan. Meanwhile he was still noted as Huntly's factor in the records of the Aberdeen sheriff court, and on 2 October 1610 he served as witness when the marquess transferred his ancestral lands in Berwickshire to the earl of Home. Kerr's personal life remains obscure though he is known to have married one Isobel Buk, mentioned in a sasine of 22 December 1604. He had died by 1 October 1611, when his son John was served as his heir.<br>
