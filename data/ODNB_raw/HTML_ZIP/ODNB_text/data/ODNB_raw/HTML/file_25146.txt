<span class="headword">Sewell, Sir  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1710&#150;1784), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of Thomas Sewell of West Ham, Essex, but nothing else is known of his background or origins. He was admitted a member of the Middle Temple on 6 June 1729 and called to the bar on 24 May 1734. He practised at the chancery bar where he worked hard and acquired &#145;a considerable practice&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 366), apparently receiving numerous briefs from dissenters. He took silk after twenty years' practice, being appointed on 4 April 1754, and was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple on 3 May of the same year. He was appointed Lent reader of his inn in 1762, and treasurer in 1765.<br>
<br>Having established himself in legal practice, Sewell embarked on an unremarkable political career. He unsuccessfully contested Wallingford, encouraged by Henry Pelham, in the general election of 1754, and subsequently sought the duke of Newcastle's nomination at Seaford (June 1755), Dover (April 1756), and Okehampton (October 1758), all without success. On 29 December 1758 he finally procured Newcastle's interest at Harwich, which he represented until the dissolution of March 1761&#151;Newcastle subsequently assigned the seat to John Roberts. In spite of Newcastle's support, Sewell was badly defeated at Exeter in the general election of 1761, but he was returned on the government interest for Winchelsea at a by-election on 4 December 1761. He remained MP for Winchelsea until his defeat in 1768 and did not stand for parliament thereafter. Sewell &#145;made no mark in the House&#146;  (Namier, 422), rarely taking part in debates and confining his infrequent observations mostly to technical points. In December 1761 he was considered for the solicitor-generalship, but in the end Newcastle recommended Fletcher Norton.<br>
<br>Sewell's foray into politics was not at the expense of his legal practice. As a king's counsel he was &#145;in full business&#146;  (Namier, 422) at the chancery bar and reputed to be earning &pound;3000 or &pound;4000 per annum.<br>
<br>Sewell's elevation to the bench was unsolicited and unexpected. Sir Thomas Clarke, master of the rolls, died in November 1764, and Fletcher Norton (then attorney-general) was expected to succeed him. However, the lord chancellor, Robert Henley, first earl of Northington, vetoed the appointment and he and William Murray, Baron Mansfield, offered the mastership of the rolls to Sewell. The offer &#145;surprised every one exceedingly, and I am told no one more than Sewell himself, who had never applied for it, and who had no idea that he was in the contemplation of the Government&#146;  (W. G. Hamilton to John Calcraft, <span class="italic">Correspondence of William Pitt, earl of Chatham</span>, ed. W. S. Taylor and J. H. Pringle, 1838&#150;40, 2.298n.). Despite the considerable drop in salary (the master of the rolls received &pound;2500 a year) Sewell accepted the offer, partly, perhaps, because his very considerable chancery practice was beginning to tax his constitution. He was knighted on 30 November 1764, appointed master of the rolls on 4 December, and sworn of the privy council on 12 December.<br>
<br>Sewell was offered the Irish lord chancellorship in 1767, but he refused the offer and went on to preside over the rolls court for more than nineteen years. Although the master of the rolls was at the time the inferior equity judge, Sewell enjoyed greater influence than might ordinarily have been afforded by his office. During the chancellorship of Henry, second Earl Bathurst, that &#145;obviously inadequate&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 12.314) judge &#145;leaned constantly&#146;  (Campbell, 7.132) on Sewell, whose assistance and influence were nowhere more clearly acknowledged than in <i>Palmer v. Mure</i> (1773). In that case, Lord Bathurst said, &#145;at first I differed in opinion with his Honour [Sewell], but he hath now convinced me &hellip; and I am first to thank him for the great pains he hath taken upon the occasion.&#146; Sewell did not enjoy such a degree of influence over Lord Chancellor Thurlow, but the latter often handed over heavy, important cases to be dealt with by his deputy, thereby once more allowing to Sewell greater influence than he might otherwise have been expected to enjoy.<br>
<br>The eighteenth-century equity judge might not have been expected to encounter many <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i> in the execution of his office, but Sewell was involved in the well-publicized case of <i>Tothill v. Pitt</i> (1766). The elder Pitt was bequeathed a considerable amount of real and personal property by Sir William Pynsent and Sewell, at first instance, applying well established principles, held that the bequest was valid. Six years later his decision was reversed by the lords commissioners of the great seal, the reversal causing a &#145;burst of surprise&#146; and attracting &#145;particular &hellip; censure&#146;  (Campbell, 130). Sewell's ruling was subsequently affirmed by the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Sewell's tenure of the mastership of the rolls was undoubtedly a success. Holdsworth described him as &#145;a very capable judge&#146; and &#145;very experienced&#146;  (Holdsworth, <span class="italic">Eng. law</span>, 12.314, 327), and Campbell considered him &#145;a very eminent Equity judge&#146;  (Campbell, 7.130). Despite their great age, a number of his decisions are still good law, perhaps the greatest testament to judicial ability. Probably the most important of these is his judgment in <i>Fletcher v. Ashburner</i> (1779), still considered the <i>locus classicus</i> of the equitable doctrine of conversion.<br>
<br>Sewell was twice married. His first wife, whom he married at All Hallows, London Wall, on 8 April 1740, was Catherine, daughter of Thomas Heath of Stansted Mountfitchet, sometime MP for Harwich. They had four sons and three daughters, the third of whom, Frances Maria, was the mother of the novelist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16597/', "Matthew Gregory (&#145;Monk&#146;) Lewis")</script>. Catherine Sewell died on 17 January 1769 and on 20 March 1773 Sewell married his second wife Mary Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 16 Nov 1743), daughter of Dr Humphrey Sibthorp (1713?&#150;1797), professor of botany at Oxford, and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25509/', "John Sibthorp")</script>. They had one daughter, who died in infancy.<br>
<br>In his later years on the bench, Sewell suffered a good deal from ill health, perhaps exacerbated by the heavy workload deputed to him by Thurlow. He made numerous offers of resignation, but his terms were always too high to be acceptable. Sewell died in office on 6 March 1784, and was buried in the Rolls Chapel. He was succeeded by Lloyd Kenyon (afterwards lord chief justice and first Baron Kenyon). Sewell died intestate, and his eldest son Thomas Bailey Heath Sewell (<i>d</i>. 1803) succeeded to his estate, including his country residence at Ottershaw Park, Surrey.<br>
