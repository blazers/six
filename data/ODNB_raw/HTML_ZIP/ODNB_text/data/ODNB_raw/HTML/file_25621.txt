<span class="headword">Sinclair,  Henry</span>  (1507/8&#150;1565), <span class="occ">judge and bishop of Ross</span>, was the son of Sir Oliver Sinclair of Roslin, Edinburghshire (<i>d</i>. 1513), and his second wife, Isabella Livingstone, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25635/', "William Sinclair, third earl of Orkney and first earl of Caithness (b. after 1407, d. 1480)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54321/', "Sinclair family (per. 1280&#150;c.1500)")</script>]. Nothing is known of his early life except for his studies at St Andrews, where he matriculated at St Leonard's College in 1524 and determined in 1524&#150;5. As his areas of study were theology, philosophy, and letters, he very probably went on to take a law degree elsewhere and practised law in some way. On 13 November 1537, on the king's instructions, he was sworn in as an ordinary lord of session. In February 1539 he acted as a commissioner of parliament.<br>
<br>Sinclair sat as a spiritual lord and for the next ten years appears in public records merely as holding various benefices. He is possibly the Henry Sinclair found briefly about this time as official of Moray diocese or the treasurer of Brechin diocese of that name. More probably he is the Master Henry Sinclair presented to the parsonage of Polwarth in 1538. In December 1538, when presented by the archbishop to be parson of Glasgow (Glasgow <i>primo</i>, which constituted a cathedral prebend), he was styled cleric of St Andrews diocese. He had been allowed by Rome to remain without taking holy orders for some years, and in April 1539 the king supported his petition for a further respite of seven years and permission to hold three incompatible benefices. There was a legal difficulty over the Glasgow prebend, as a previous incumbent had resigned it in favour of an Italian cardinal who refused to give up his right. The king, for two years and more, insisted to Rome on Sinclair's appointment being accepted. Sinclair resigned the prebend in 1550 but held the liferent until his death.<br>
<br>In February 1541 the king nominated Sinclair to Rome as perpetual commendator of Kilwinning Abbey (the nomination was repeated in December) and on 1 May 1542 bulls for this were issued, but with the incumbent abbot retaining his position and the abbatial revenues. Sinclair was in practical terms his successor. He received a five-year tack (lease) of Kilwinning in 1545 and became commendator in reality on the abbot's death in 1547 or 1548. He was also in 1548 tacksman of Currie church, near Edinburgh. Then, in April 1550, on resigning Kilwinning in exchange for the office of dean in Glasgow diocese, he received a pension for life from Kilwinning revenues.<br>
<br>In August 1550 Sinclair was an envoy to England and Flanders to deal with terms of peace, and in 1554 he is recorded as returning from France, though it is not known how long he had been abroad. Then, perhaps in 1555 and certainly in May 1559, he was one of those empowered to treat with English commissioners over terms of peace.<br>
<br>Having been for some years vice-president of the college of justice, in 1558 Sinclair succeeded Bishop Robert Reid as its president. Then in November that year, following the death of Bishop Panter of Ross, the crown granted to Sinclair the temporalities of the diocese and nominated him to Rome as bishop, but his provision was delayed as Rome at this juncture wanted a guarantee of orthodoxy. Eventually, by bulls of 2 June 1561, he was provided to Ross, with the stipulation that he should resign as dean of Glasgow. After Queen Mary's return to Scotland he sat on the privy council, and he remained in Edinburgh, where the college of justice sat. In 1563 and early 1564 he was involved in arrangements for administering justice throughout the land. Already in September 1562, however, his health was poor, and in July 1563 he went to France for treatment. He travelled through England to France at some point in 1564, was operated on for a kidney stone in September, and died in Paris on 1 or 2 January 1565, in his fifty-eighth year.<br>
<br>A man of distinguished ancestry, Sinclair was related to royal Stewarts and noble Hamiltons, with whom he had property dealings. He also purchased the lands of Stevinstoun, Haddingtonshire, which he granted shortly after, in 1537, to his brother James. To all appearances he made very competent use of church revenues to support himself. As late as 1563, being a lord of session, he remained exempt from the one-third tax on his income from Ross diocese, the Glasgow deanship, and his Kilwinning pension. His career was in the law, with church benefices providing the necessary financial support. In 1549, although a commendator-abbot, he did not attend the provincial church council.<br>
<br>In addition to his many years on the bench, Sinclair made permanent contributions to Scots law. In 1554 he was responsible for introducing improvements in the course of justice, while &#145;Sinclair's practicks&#146;, a compilation of judgments and precedents, proved invaluable (though the credit for this, formerly given to him, is probably due rather to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25624/', "John Sinclair (c.1510&#150;1566)")</script>, whose career closely paralleled his own). Henry Sinclair was also known for his erudition beyond the law, and indeed the remains of his quite outstanding library show the width of his scholarly interests, embracing Renaissance humanism as well as scholastic theology. Alongside printed texts by classical authors including Plutarch, Cicero, and Horace, the collection contained the writings of such contemporary luminaries as Erasmus, Paolo Giovio, and Juan Luis Vives.<br>
<br>There can be little doubt that Sinclair remained a Catholic after the Reformation Parliament of 1560, though he has been described as indifferent in matters of church allegiance. All indications point to this: his support of Catholics, his relations with France, the hostility of Thomas Randolph (English agent in Scotland), the outright condemnations by John Knox. This commitment to Catholicism, however, was combined with his upholding of the law and his outstanding integrity as a senior judge, exemplified in his personal conduct. This explains his advice that laws against Catholic practice had to be observed, his declaring Knox to be innocent of a treasonable act, his refusal in 1562 to meet the Jesuit Nicholas Goudanus on a clandestine mission to Scotland, his supplying bread and wine (in his capacity of life-renter of Glasgow parsonage) for protestant communion. Even Randolph praised his public-spiritedness. A contemporary writer declared that never before had two such honest and erudite men as Henry and John Sinclair come from the same family.<br>
