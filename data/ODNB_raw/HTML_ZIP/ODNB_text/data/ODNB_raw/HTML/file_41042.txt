<span class="headword">Prest,  Thomas Peckett</span>  (1809/10&#150;1859), <span class="occ">writer and playwright</span>, was probably the Thomas Prest who was born on 13 May 1810 and baptized at St Mary's, Marylebone Road, London, the third child and second son of William Prest, blacksmith, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pecket. Having been apprenticed to a printer, he became a compositor and he appears in London in the early 1830s, writing and performing songs for the saloons and singing clubs, and working as a general literary hack for minor publishers of the unstamped press. He edited and largely wrote ephemeral penny periodicals, including <span class="italic">The Weekly Penny Comic Magazine, or, Repertory of Wit and Humour</span> (1832), <span class="italic">The London Singer's Magazine and Reciter's Album</span>, volume 1 (1834?), <span class="italic">The Magazine of Curiosity and Wonder</span> (1835&#150;6), and <span class="italic">Tales of the Drama</span> (1836&#150;7). He also wrote melodramas for the Pavilion Theatre.<br>
<br>Prest's quest for new material drew him to the work of Dickens, and in 1836 Edward Lloyd, then a minor publisher of ephemera, issued Prest's <span class="italic">The Sketch Book</span>, by &#145;Bos&#146; in penny numbers. In April 1837, a year after Dickens (Boz) had begun <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span> (1836&#150;7) in monthly shilling parts, Prest began writing a penny weekly serial, <span class="italic">The Posthumorous Notes of the Pickwick Club, or, The Penny Pickwick</span>, by &#145;Bos&#146; (1837&#150;8). Prest's version freely adapted and expanded Dickens's work for a working-class readership. Aided by spirited woodcuts by the popular cartoonist C. J. Grant, &#145;this disgraceful fabrication&#146;, as G. A. Sala noted, &#145;had an immense sale&#146;  (Sala, 74). At over 850 pages it was considerably longer, and at the time probably sold more copies, than Dickens's original. Prest followed this success with other adaptations, including <span class="italic">Oliver Twiss</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Nickelas Nicklebery</span> (1838), <span class="italic">Pickwick in America!</span> (1839), <span class="italic">A Legend of the Tower of London</span> (1840) by &#145;J. H. Hainsforth&#146; after the novel by W. H. Ainsworth, and a plagiarism of Henry Cockton's <span class="italic">Valentine Vox</span>, <span class="italic">The Adventures of Valentine Vaux</span> by Timothy Portwine (1840).<br>
<br>These penny serials established Edward Lloyd as a popular publisher, and alerted him and his rivals to the potential of cheap fiction written specifically for the rapidly expanding mass urban readership of the time. Lloyd commissioned Prest to write more sensational novels, paying 10<i>s</i>. a number, money which is said to have financed Prest's drinking at his favourite tavern, the White Swan, Salisbury Court, Fleet Street. Prest has been commonly credited with being the author of <span class="italic">Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street</span>, but recent scholarship has revealed that the tale was actually the work of James Malcolm Rymer. Prest's most popular single work, the gypsy romance <span class="italic">Ela the Outcast</span> (1839&#150;40), was followed by over sixty &#145;bloods&#146; written for Lloyd in the 1840s. These showed a remarkable versatility in adapting literary genres&#151;historical fiction after Scott in <span class="italic">The Hebrew Maiden</span> (1840), naval in <span class="italic">Gallant Tom</span> (1840), Gothic in <span class="italic">The Death Grasp</span> (1841), and domestic in <span class="italic">Emily Fitzormond</span> (1841), while a novel like <span class="italic">The Death Ship, or, The Pirate's Bride and the Maniac of the Deep</span> (1846) combines them all. Possibly as a result of ill health his fiction output decreased in the 1850s, and his last major novel was <span class="italic">Grace Walton, or, The Wanderers of the Heath</span> (1857). He continued to write melodramas, notably <span class="italic">The Miser of Shoreditch</span> (the Standard Theatre, 1854) and <span class="italic">Lucy Wentworth</span> (prize-winning play, the City of London Theatre, 1857).<br>
<br>Although not possessing a major creative talent Prest wrote vigorous, stylized prose that popularized penny fiction at the moment when an increasingly literate working-class public were tiring of political and educational reading and looking for entertainment. With his knowledge of popular taste and in particular melodrama he adapted middle-class writing for a popular audience, facilitating a significant stage in the development of literature for the masses. He married, on 7 November 1842 at St Saviour's Church, Southwark, Elizabeth Barbara, daughter of George Moss. His wife died in 1843 and there were no children. He died of phlebitis at his home, 9 George Street, Thornhill Bridge, Islington, London, aged forty-nine, on 5 June 1859 and was buried in St Pancras and Islington cemetery.<br>
