<span class="headword">Thomas <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Haig]</span>,  Sybil Margaret</span>, Viscountess Rhondda  (1857&#150;1941), <span class="occ">suffragette</span>, was born at 52 Norfolk Square, Brighton, on 25 February 1857, the fourth daughter in the family of five daughters and five sons of George Augustus Haig (1820&#150;1906), merchant and landowner, and his wife, Anne Eliza Fell (<i>d</i>. 1894) of Pen Ithon, Radnorshire. Her father was descended from the Haigs of Bemersyde, an ancient Scottish border family, to which Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig also belonged. On 27 June 1882, aged twenty-five, she married, in the billiard room at Pen Ithon, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36470/', "David Alfred Thomas (later created Viscount Rhondda)")</script> of Ysguborwen, Glamorgan (1856&#150;1918), Liberal MP for Merthyr Boroughs (1888&#150;1910), and leading south Wales industrialist. Her husband's political career meant that she spent much time in London but their main home was a large house and estate at Llan-wern, Monmouthshire. The couple had only one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36479/', "Margaret Haig Thomas")</script>, who, as Lady Rhondda, became a prominent businesswoman and Britain's leading equal rights feminist in the inter-war years.<br>
<br>The life of Sybil Thomas was overshadowed by the glittering careers of both her husband and her daughter. Usually depicted as quiet and conventional, this small, attractive woman put conscience before propriety, held firm opinions of her own, and was highly regarded by her contemporaries. Her obituary notice in the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> (12 March 1941) described her as &#145;A woman of strong but pleasing personality&#146; and noted her wide contribution to life in South Wales. In fact she made a significant contribution to the Liberal women's organization in Wales, to the women's suffrage movement, and to the First World War effort, as well as playing a key role in shaping her daughter's career.<br>
<br>In the 1890s Sybil Thomas was president of the Welsh Union of Women's Liberal Associations (established 1891) and during her tenure the union pursued a strongly feminist and pro-suffrage agenda. As a Liberal and the wife of a prominent man, she was associated with the moderate wing of the suffrage movement, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, under the leadership of Millicent Fawcett. The other Haig women, including her sisters Janetta and Lotty and cousin Florence, favoured Mrs Pankhurst's militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU): both Janetta and Florence had been imprisoned for acts of violence. When her daughter, Margaret, announced her intention of joining the suffrage procession to Hyde Park on 21 July 1908, Sybil decided to accompany her on the grounds &#145;(a) she did not think an unmarried girl should walk unchaperoned through the gutter, (b) because she believed in votes for women&#146;  (Mackworth, <span class="italic">My World</span>, 118). Her mixed motives show a nice balance between her adherence to convention and to principle. Thereafter Sybil became more closely associated with the WSPU, entertaining Mrs Pankhurst and holding fund-raising events at Llan-wern. In 1913 she acted as treasurer to Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of the WSPU. In 1914 she deliberately sought imprisonment by holding a public meeting outside the houses of parliament: on her refusal to pay a fine the magistrate sentenced her to one day's imprisonment.<br>
<br>During the First World War Lady Rhondda, as she became after D. A. Thomas's elevation to the peerage in 1916, chaired the women's advisory committee of the National Savings Committee. She gave over part of the house at Llan-wern as a hospital, and she travelled extensively with her husband in carrying out his duties for the government, notably as food controller (1917&#150;18). Following her husband's promotion to a viscountcy in 1918 she became Viscountess Rhondda. She was appointed a dame commander in the Order of the British Empire in 1920 for her wartime services.<br>
<br>Viscountess Rhondda played a key, but largely unacknowledged, role in shaping her daughter's life. It was she who suggested that her husband should take Margaret into his business, a large conglomerate of coal, shipping, and publishing interests, as his private secretary, and it was she who was most supportive of Margaret's suffrage activities. She survived her husband, who died in July 1918, for twenty-three years, for much of which she continued in public and philanthropic work. She died at her home, Llan-wern Park, Newport, Monmouthshire, on 11 March 1941, and was buried at Llan-wern on 14 March.<br>
