<span class="headword">Orme,  William</span>  (1787&#150;1830), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born on 3 February 1787 at Falkirk, Stirlingshire. His parents moved to Edinburgh, and in 1792 he began his education under a schoolmaster named Waugh. On 1 July 1800 he was apprenticed to a wheelwright and turner. He disliked the work, but completed his five years. His father died in October 1803, and about this time he became a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of James Alexander Haldane, whom he had heard preach at the tabernacle on Leith Walk, Edinburgh. In October 1805 he was admitted by Robert Haldane as a student for the ministry under George Cowie in Edinburgh. The usual period of study was two years, but Orme's periods of study, interrupted by a spell of preaching in Fife during 1806, amounted to little more than a year in all.<br>
<br>On 11 March 1807 Orme became pastor of the Congregational Tabernacle at Perth, where he was ordained. About 1808 he was married, but his wife died following childbirth, and he later remarried. In 1809 Robert Haldane adopted Baptist views and evicted Orme's Congregationalists in favour of those in his congregation who became Baptists. Orme refused an offer to move to the Congregational church in Dundee, and spent many years searching for a suitable place of worship. He played a leading part in the development of Scottish Congregationalism as one of the twelve who met in September 1812 to draw up a scheme for a Congregational Union of Scotland, which was formed in 1813, and as one of the founders of the Glasgow Theological Academy in 1814.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1824 Orme moved to the Congregational church at Camberwell Green, Surrey, and soon afterwards was elected foreign secretary of the London Missionary Society. In 1827 he was one of a deputation to MPs known to be sympathetic to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, and he also played an important part in the founding of a college in Gower Street, in 1828, which led to the granting of a charter founding the University of London in 1836.<br>
<br>Orme was a leading biographer of seventeenth-century puritans, and his <span class="italic">The Works of John Owen, with Memoirs of his Life</span> (1820) and <span class="italic">Life and Times of Richard Baxter</span> (1830) were particularly influential. Other works included <span class="italic">A Catechism of the Constitution and Ordinances of the Kingdom of Christ</span> (1817), which was regarded by the Scottish Congregational churches as an authentic statement of their views of church membership, <span class="italic">Remarkable Passages in the Life of William Kiffin</span> (1823), and <span class="italic">Memoirs of John Urquhart</span> (1827). Orme died on 8 May 1830 at his home in Camberwell, and was buried on 17 May at Bunhill Fields. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
