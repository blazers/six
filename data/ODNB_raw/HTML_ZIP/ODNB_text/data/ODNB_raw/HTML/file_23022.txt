<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rainbow <span class="st"> [Rainbowe]</span>,  Edward</span>  (1608&#150;1684), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was born on 20 April 1608 at Blyton in Lindsey, Lincolnshire, son of Thomas Rainbow, the vicar, and his wife, Rebecca, daughter of David Allen, rector of the neighbouring parish of Ludborough. After a short time at school in Gainsborough he was sent in April 1620 to Peterborough to study under John Williams, then one of the prebendaries, and an old friend of his father. When, in 1621, Williams was preferred to the deanery of Westminster and bishopric of Lincoln, Rainbow transferred to Westminster School. In July 1623 Rainbow obtained a scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where his brother was a fellow, but in July 1625, through the family of his godfather Edward Wray of Rycot, he received from Frances, dowager countess of Warwick, a nomination to one of the Wray scholarships founded at Magdalene College, Cambridge, by her father. He graduated BA in 1627 and proceeded MA in 1630; during his time as a student he acquitted himself well when called on by the vice-chancellor to make a speech.<br>
<br>In July 1630 Rainbow accepted the mastership of a school at Kirton in Lindsey, but soon moved with some Cambridge contemporaries to London, settling first in Fuller's Rents, and afterwards at Sion College, so as to make use of the library. He was ordained in April 1632. After an unsuccessful application for the chaplaincy at Lincoln's Inn he was appointed curate at the Savoy Chapel by the minister, Thomas Hastler.<br>
<br>In November 1633 Rainbow was recalled to Cambridge. The master and fellows of Magdalene College elected him to a by-fellowship on Dr Goche's foundation, with a pre-election to the first open fellowship that should fall vacant. Four closed fellowships were to fall vacant before Rainbow joined the foundation. He became a successful tutor; two sons of the earl of Suffolk and two sons of Francis Leke, Baron Deincourt, became his pupils. On 23 September 1634 he preached at Paul's Cross a sermon published as <span class="italic">Labour Forbidden and Commanded</span> (1635). In 1637 he accepted the small vicarage of Childerley, near Cambridge, and became dean of Magdalene. In 1642 he was appointed master in succession to Henry Smyth by the earl of Suffolk, who had promised it to him some years earlier. He proved himself an effective master, putting college registers in order, ably managing finances and increasing student numbers.<br>
<br>The House of Lords granted Rainbow a pass into Holland on 16 May 1645. In 1648 he became rector of Great Easton, Essex, where there is evidence that he used the liturgy from the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, or a close adaptation of it. The preface to his <span class="italic">A Sermon &hellip; Preached at the Interring of the Corps of &hellip; Susanna Countess of Suffolk</span> (1649) was dated from Audley End on 11 September 1649. Ejected from his mastership in 1650 for refusal to swear to the engagement, he told the parliamentary committee for regulating the universities that his objection was on grounds of conscience but that he intended to live peaceably in the Commonwealth.<br>
<br>In 1652 Rainbow married Elizabeth Smyth (<i>d</i>. 1702), daughter of his predecessor at Magdalene, and accepted from the earl of Suffolk the small living of Little Chesterford, Essex. At the presentation of the earl of Warwick, and with the assistance of Lord Broghill, he became rector of Benefield, Northamptonshire, on 23 March 1659. At the Restoration, apparently to his surprise, Rainbow was restored to his mastership at Magdalene, and appointed chaplain to the king. In 1661 he was made dean of Peterborough, but returned to Cambridge on being appointed vice-chancellor in November 1662.<br>
<br>On the translation of Richard Sterne to the archbishopric of York, Rainbow was consecrated bishop of Carlisle on 10 July 1664 in Westminster Abbey by Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon. Having resigned his other preferments he had to borrow money to pay for his consecration, first-fruits, and costs of settlement in the diocese. The ruined state of his palace, Rose Castle, involved him in a heavy outlay on building a new parlour and chapel, and after protracted litigation with his predecessor and Archbishop Sterne, from whom he received &pound;400 in dilapidations, he found much in his diocese that required reform. His visitation articles were published in 1667. Clergy found negligent did not hesitate to defy their bishop publicly, and his outspoken denunciation of immorality appears to have offended some great lady at court, once a friend, who revenged herself by blocking his translation to Lincoln in 1668. He was also rumoured for preferment on Sheldon's death in 1677, but received no offer. That year he published a funeral sermon for Anne, countess of Pembroke.<br>
<br>Rainbow's hospitality and charity were boundless. In years of scarcity, when his own stores were exhausted, he bought barley and distributed it to the poor; sometimes 150 were relieved in one day by the porter at Rose. To the poor at Carlisle and Dalston he made a monthly payment of 30<i>s</i>. He paid for the education of poor boys at Dalston School, and for putting them out as apprentices; he supported poor scholars at the universities; he subscribed generously to the French protestants and to foreign converts.<br>
<br>Rainbow's domestic life was a model of piety: prayers were read four times a day, swearing was banned, and servants were required to live blamelessly. He was an orthodox but moderate Anglican who was sympathetic to nonconformists. His strong eirenicism encouraged friendships with presbyterians such as Francis Tallents, and had enabled him at Cambridge to manage the restoration of ejected fellows without rancour. He was famous as a preacher, and in his later sermons abandoned the ornate rhetoric of his early days for exceptional plainness and perspicuity. He planned a treatise, to be called &#145;Verba Christi&#146;, a collection of Christ's sermons and sayings, but it was never completed.<br>
<br>Rainbow died at home on the morning of 26 March 1684 and was buried at Dalston church on 1 April. The sermon preached at his funeral by his chaplain and chancellor, Thomas Tullie, was published, together with some of his meditations and short poems, in Jonathan Banks's <span class="italic">The Life of &hellip; Edw. Rainbow</span> (1688). Elizabeth Rainbow, who after her husband's death lived mainly at Dalemain with her sister's son Sir Edward Hasell, died in 1702, and was also buried at Dalston.<br>
