<span class="headword">Omond,  George William Thomson</span>  (1846&#150;1929), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 13 September 1846 at Craigentor, Monzie, near Crieff, Perthshire, the only son and second of the five children of John Reid Omond (1804&#150;1892), minister of the Free Church of Scotland in Monzie, and his wife, Margaret Jane Thomson (<i>d</i>. 1887), daughter of William Aird Thomson, minister, of Perth. His parents were both Scottish; his father, the former parish minister of Monzie, &#145;came out&#146; at the Disruption in 1843. He was baptized &#145;George William&#146; in the parish church on 11 October 1846, but it was in accordance with the forms of the Free Church of Scotland that he married Margaret Isabella Alice Wright (<i>c</i>.1849&#150;1932), daughter of James Wright, foreign merchant, on 23 July 1878. They had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>Omond was educated at Edinburgh Academy (1857&#150;64) and at Edinburgh University (1864&#150;8); he graduated MA with a first in classics and a second in philosophy. In his second year he matriculated as &#145;George William Thomson Omond&#146;. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1871 but had no extensive practice, though he was appointed as an advocate-depute in 1885. In 1886 he stood as a Liberal for West Perthshire. He was not elected and instead pursued his career in writing, particularly historical writing, rather than the law or politics, though he continued to designate himself advocate of the Scots bar. His first book, <span class="italic">The Merchant Shipping Acts 1854 to 1876</span> (1877), indicated some early interest in shipping law; but it was his historical interest in the law of the sea, as it affected neutral merchant ships in time of war, which was apparent in two later works, <span class="italic">The Law of the Sea</span> (1916) and <span class="italic">A Documentary History of the Armed Neutralities 1780 and 1800</span> (1919), in which he collaborated with Sir F. Piggott.<br>
<br>Undoubtedly Omond's best-known historical work is <span class="italic">The Lord Advocates of Scotland</span> (2 vols., 1883), which deals with the office of lord advocate and the careers of the holders of it from the fifteenth century to the passing of the <span class="roman">Scottish Reform Act</span> (1832). In part it was overtaken by later studies but it remained a valuable source. <span class="italic">The Lord Advocates of Scotland: Second Series, 1834&#150;1880</span> (1914), less well known and sometimes overlooked, updated the story to 1880. Other contributions to Scottish history are <span class="italic">The Arniston Memoirs &hellip; 1571&#150;1838</span> (1887), an account of the remarkable legal family and dynasty, the Dundases of Arniston; and studies concerning the history of attempts to unite Scotland and England, <span class="italic">Fletcher of Saltoun</span> (1897) and <span class="italic">The Early History of the Scottish Union Question</span> (1897). In the 1890s Omond tried his hand at fiction with three novels which were later forgotten. <span class="italic">The Boers in Europe</span> (1903) was a patriotic piece on continental support for the Boer cause. In 1917 Omond was elected FRHistS. He served on the society's council from 1919 to 1922 and as vice-president from 1922 to 1925.<br>
<br>One of Omond's major interests was the Low Countries and their history, an interest focused principally on Belgium, where Omond lived for a considerable period. This led to a number of publications between 1906 and 1928, including guide books, with some recycled material and illustrated mainly by Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Forestier. Omond also produced a popular history, <span class="italic">Belgium and Luxembourg</span> (1923), and was responsible for the chapter &#145;Belgium, 1830&#150;1839&#146; in the second volume, published in 1923, of the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy</span>, edited by A. W. Ward and G. P. Gooch. He wrote various articles on questions relating to Belgium and for his contributions to Anglo-Belgian relations he was made a chevalier of the order of the Crown (Belgium).<br>
<br>Omond was said to have a kind and genial personality. In the latter part of his life he lived in England, in Essex, Kent, and Surrey. He died on 18 June 1929 at Knaphill, Surrey, survived by his wife.<br>
