<span class="headword">Beilby family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1755&#150;1819), <span class="occ">glass enamellers and engravers</span>, originated with <a name="cosubject_67316"></a><span class="headword">William Beilby</span>  (1740&#150;1819), <span class="occ">glass enameller</span>, born on 9 July 1740 in Durham, the fourth of the seven children of William Beilby (1706&#150;1765), a silversmith, and his wife, Mary Bainbridge (<i>d</i>. 1778). The elder William Beilby established himself as a silversmith in Durham after his marriage in 1733; in 1759, after years of financial problems, he gave up his business and moved to Gateshead. The younger William was admitted in 1751 as king's scholar at Durham grammar school, where he was noted for his interest in the classics. However, owing to the family's persistent financial misfortune he was sent to Birmingham in the same year to begin an apprenticeship as an enameller. There he appears to have lived with his elder brother Richard and was indentured in 1755 to a John Hezeldine. His acquaintance with glass is likely to have begun at this period, in what was then a centre of the British glass industry.<br>
<br>William moved to Gateshead in 1760 to join his family, in particular his brother <a href="#cosubject_1966">Ralph Beilby [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who had set up a workshop at Amen Corner, near Newcastle Cathedral. The following years were crucial in William's technical experiments with firing enamels onto glass goblets. These were carried out at the nearby Closegate flint glasshouses and yielded the first results in rather weak white enamels but, from 1761, also in colour.<br>
<br>The delicately hand-painted glassware of the 1760s shows the development of the artist's skills. In co-operation with Ralph, who had established himself as an expert in heraldry, William produced the masterpieces of his &#145;heraldic phase&#146;, in particular the royal goblets (<i>c</i>.1764; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and Philadelphia Museum of Art). While commissions poured in from aristocratic patrons, he must still have experienced a degree of financial hardship, as he advertised as a drawing-master in 1767; his drawing school continued until 1778. At the time the family was resident at the Forth Gardens, Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>The young artist Thomas Bewick (1753&#150;1828) joined the Beilby workshop as an apprentice in 1767, and his influence may first be discerned in the pastoral scene on the reverse of the flask for Thomas Brown (1769; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The introduction of landscapes, birds, exotic flora, and so on may be regarded as characteristic of William's later style. However, this flask is also the last-known authenticated and dated work by William Beilby. He continued to produce enamelled glassware throughout the 1770s, yet his output appears to have slowed, partly on account of the devastation caused by the 1771 Tyne flood, and partly as a result of his sister's illness. His departure from Newcastle at the end of the 1770s seems to have been motivated both by the break-up of his family after his mother's death in 1778 and by Bewick's being taken into full partnership at the family firm in 1777. There is sufficient evidence of William Beilby in Battersea over the next few years to substantiate the common view of his having set up as a drawing-master. On 12 October 1785 he married Ellen Purton (<i>b</i>. 1765), twenty-five years his junior, the niece of John Falconer, a wealthy City merchant of Scottish descent. About 1788 the couple moved to Fife to live on an estate which Falconer had bought for his niece; nothing is known about their life there.<br>
<br>William Beilby's subsequent move to Hull is equally obscure, especially given his wife's significant inheritance from her uncle's fortune. In 1814 he is recorded as living in English Street. The question of his artistic activities in the years after Newcastle has been contentious, in particular the possibility of glass made in Scotland. Some watercolours survive in private collections in the Hull area, alongside earlier views of Battersea. The Beilbys appear to have had two sons and a daughter, of whom only William Turton Beilby is recorded in Hull in 1822. William Beilby died at home on 8 October 1819; no tombstone or memorial of him survives in Hull.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_1966"></a><span class="headword">Ralph Beilby</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1743, <em>d.</em> 1817), <span class="occ">engraver and businessman</span>, was baptized on 12 August 1743 at St Margaret's, Durham, the third son of William and Mary Beilby. He was educated at Durham grammar school and was then apprenticed to his father. While he started to engrave in silver, he moved on to copper-engraving and seal-cutting upon the return of his brother Richard from Birmingham. Ralph was the driving force behind the family's move to Gateshead after his father's business folded. He set up Beilby &amp; Co. and moved the business to Amen Corner in Newcastle upon Tyne after the trial for forgery of the well-known engraver Jameson had created a vacancy in the city. In addition to acting as the family's business brain, Ralph Beilby acquired considerable expertise in the fields of heraldry and chivalry, which made him the preferred engraver of the northern aristocracy.<br>
<br>Ralph's own artistic work flourished through his collaboration with the historian John Brand, which produced the engraving of Thornton's monument plate for Brand's history of Newcastle and a plan of Newcastle in 1788. Yet he is mostly remembered as Thomas Bewick's master after the latter's entry into the Beilby workshop. Their collaboration produced, among other works, <span class="italic">A General History of Quadrupeds</span>; however, disagreement over the fourth edition of this work led to the dissolution of the enterprise in January 1798.<br>
<br>Ralph Beilby's artistic output became less prolific after his marriage on 3 December 1780 to Ellen Hawthorne (<i>d</i>. 1833). He set up a new business with James Hawthorne, his brother-in-law, which dealt in the production of watch-glasses and clockwork. Their premises were destroyed by fire in 1806 and subsequently rebuilt, and shortly afterwards Ralph Beilby took early retirement. He remained active as a patron of the arts and was a founder member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne. He died on 4 January 1817 and was buried at St Andrew's, Newcastle.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67317"></a><span class="headword">Mary Beilby</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1750, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">glass artist</span>, was baptized on 12 February 1750 at St Nicholas's Church, Durham, the last of the seven children of William and Mary Beilby. She was educated privately at Durham and appears to have joined the family workshop at a very young age. Her contribution is associated principally with William Beilby's work in the 1760s. A considerable number of items have been attributed to her, yet disentangling the Beilby hands is problematic. Many attributions to Mary Beilby seem to be a result of our lack of knowledge about other artists active at the time. Mary's romance with Thomas Bewick after the young artist's entry into the family workshop is related in Bewick's <span class="italic">Memoir</span>. Yet nothing came of it, and in 1774 Mary suffered a paralytic stroke from which she does not appear to have recovered. It is unclear whether she followed her brother to Battersea. At any rate, she joined William and his wife at their estate in Fife, where she died in 1797.<br>
