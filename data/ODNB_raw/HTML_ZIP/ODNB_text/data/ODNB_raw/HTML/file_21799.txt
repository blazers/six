<span class="headword">Pelham,  Thomas</span>, second earl of Chichester  (1756&#150;1826), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Spring Gardens, London, on 28 April 1756, the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21798/', "Thomas Pelham, first earl of Chichester (1728&#150;1805)")</script>, politician, and his wife, Anne Frankland (1734/5&#150;1813), daughter of Frederick Meinhart Frankland. He was educated at Westminster School and at Clare College, Cambridge, and between 1775 and 1778 visited Spain (where he stayed with the ambassador, Lord Grantham), France, Italy, Germany, and Austria.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1780 Pelham was returned unopposed to parliament for Sussex on his family's interest. He sat undisturbed there for the duration of his Commons career. He had joined Brooks's Club four months before his return and became a member of the Whig Club in 1786. Accordingly he voted with the Rockingham whig opposition on economic reform on 26 February 1781, and against the American War of Independence on 12 December 1781, 22 and 27 February 1782, but, conscious of his father's financial dependence on his sinecure and household offices, he sided with the North ministry against the censure motions of 8 and 15 March 1782. On the formation of Lord Rockingham's administration the following month he was appointed surveyor-general of the ordnance under his Sussex neighbour and friend the third duke of Richmond. He remained in office when Lord Shelburne became prime minister after Rockingham's death and was privately critical of Fox for precipitately resigning. In August 1782 he declined the offer of a diplomatic post from Lord Grantham, Fox's successor as foreign secretary. On the formation of the Fox&#150;North coalition in April 1783 he resigned. Four months later he somewhat reluctantly agreed to the request of the duke of Portland, the premier, that he become Irish secretary in the room of the ailing William Windham, who had recommended him as &#145;a man of engaging gentlemanlike manners and pleasant temper&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 33100, fol. 219). He sat for Carrick-on-Shannon in the Irish parliament. On the fall of the coalition in December 1783 he declined Pitt's offer to retain him in his office and resigned in January 1784, although he personally would have preferred a union of parties.<br>
<br>Pelham was an active member of the Foxite opposition to Pitt in the 1784 parliament. His personal charm and even temper won him the friendship of the leaders and his reputation for acuteness and reliability made him a significant figure in the second rank. He was, however, a nervous and lacklustre speaker, even though he moved the Furrukhabad charge against Hastings on 2 March 1787, and played a part in his trial; he was appointed a manager of the impeachment on 14 February 1791.<br>
<br>In June 1791 Pelham visited Paris, but he prudently destroyed the letters to Barnarve and Lafayette requesting guarantees for the safety of the French royal family with which Fox had entrusted him. He was at this point favourably disposed towards the new regime in France and was described by Burke as &#145;a runner to the French revolution&#146;, who was &#145;endeavouring everywhere by various rumours and idle speculations to reconcile the minds of people to it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, 7.30). The formation of the Association of the Friends of the People perturbed him, but he absolved Fox from blame for their excesses and, still deeply suspicious of Pitt and anxious to preserve the unity of the opposition, did not become an alarmist. From July 1792 to August 1793 he travelled in Europe, wintering in Italy with Elizabeth, Lady Webster, later Lady Holland, with whom he had an affair. Although he resisted pressure to go back to England at the turn of the year, when he was tentatively included in a list of Portland whigs, his political views had changed decisively. Dismayed by the violent progress of the revolution, he believed that Fox was taking a dangerous and misguided line, yet remained reluctant to break with him. On his return home he became one of the trustees of Fox's subscription fund, but he was now in political agreement with the Portland whigs, believing that for the moment it was better to support the war against France without taking office. He accordingly declined an offer of a diplomatic mission to Florence in December 1793 and, with Tom Grenville and William Windham, acted as one of the self-styled &#145;virtuous triumvirate&#146; who refused to join the administration. He parted regretfully but amicably from Fox on 20 January 1794 and during the ensuing session worked with Windham to cultivate and encourage &eacute;migr&eacute; leaders. He made little mark in the Commons, being undermined by illness and bouts of depression and self-loathing, partly on account of Lady Webster's continued absence in Italy. He confided to her in the spring of 1794 that while he approved the formal junction of the Portland whigs with the government he was unwilling to take any direct personal part in it. He turned down a ministerial proposal that he should take charge of affairs in the West Indies and resolved not to accept the Irish secretaryship, after having heard rumours that he would be appointed. In September 1794 he went with Windham, who was now the secretary at war, on a brief mission to the duke of York at army headquarters on the continent, but four months later he declined the duke's request to act as his parliamentary spokesman if he became commander-in-chief. Pelham hinted that he contemplated retiring from public life at the next dissolution.<br>
<br>On the recall of the Irish lord lieutenant Lord Fitzwilliam in early 1795, Pelham, however, allowed himself to be bullied by Portland, the home secretary, who made it clear that refusal of office would blight his future prospects, into going to Ireland as chief secretary to Lord Camden. He was duly returned to the Irish parliament for Clogher and spoke against Catholic relief on 4 May 1795, but his health was again poor and he returned to England in the summer of 1795. He was keen to step down and irritated by the government's distribution of revenue patronage to opponents of his family's electoral interest at Seaford. In September 1795 he refused the offer of a diplomatic mission to Vienna. Portland's persistent arm-twisting broke his resistance once again and in February 1796 he returned reluctantly to Dublin. Although he spent long periods in England, he dealt capably with the routine business of Irish administration and remained in Ireland during the difficult year of 1797. He got on well with Camden and became a popular secretary, even with the Irish opposition, but he was never in Pitt's confidence, had little influence on the general direction of Irish policy, and grew increasingly resentful of Portland's condescending and disdainful attitude towards him. When Abercromby, the commander-in-chief, publicly condemned the Irish military in February 1798, Pelham defended them in the Irish Commons, where he now represented Armagh. Soon afterwards he fell seriously and almost mortally ill. On his partial recovery he drafted, but never sent, a reproachful letter to Portland, in which he protested against the British cabinet's disowning of Abercromby's remarks and complained that he had been duped into resuming his office in 1796. He convalesced in England in the summer of 1798, intending to return to Ireland under Lord Cornwallis, but he eventually opted for retirement and was formally replaced by his locum, Lord Castlereagh, in November.<br>
<br>Pelham declined a diplomatic posting to Vienna in May 1799. A year later he was astonished by a report that Pitt believed that he did not want office and enraged by another report that Portland had suggested that he had given up his own pretensions for the sake of his relatives' claims. He made it clear to Pitt that he was still a contender for an office that would be financially beneficial. He mentioned the reversion of Lord Liverpool's Irish sinecure of clerk of the pells, but nothing came of this. When Addington replaced Pitt as prime minister early in 1801 Pelham, not wishing to be estranged from his closest associates, who were about to go out, refused two offers of a cabinet place, the second of which was coupled with a scheme to have him called to the Lords to take the lead there. Informed that the king, who had always had a soft spot for him, wanted him to join the new ministry, he acceded to another approach and anticipated becoming war secretary with the lead in the upper house. Yet Portland allowed Lord Hobart to be appointed instead and tried to persuade Pelham to become president of the Board of Control (of which he was a commissioner from May 1801 until July 1802). He refused this and asked Addington to postpone his elevation. It was eventually arranged that he should replace Portland as home secretary, and in the interim he chaired the secret committee on Irish disaffection, presented its report to the Commons on 13 April and 15 May, and introduced the <span class="roman">Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill</span> on 14 April. Determined to have the Home Office, he rejected Addington's offer of the Russian embassy. On 29 June 1801, six days after his father was created earl of Chichester, Pelham was called to the Lords in his barony of Pelham of Stanmer. He replaced Portland in July 1801 and on 16 July married Lady Mary Henrietta Juliana Osborne (1776&#150;1862), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20876/', "Francis Osborne, fifth duke of Leeds (1751&#150;1799)")</script>, and his first wife, Lady Amelia D'Arcy. They had four sons, the eldest of whom died in childhood, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Pelham's relations with Addington, with whom he clashed over foreign policy, Irish affairs, and patronage, were always strained. He became increasingly isolated in the cabinet and had little personal influence. In March 1802 he registered a protest against signing the definitive treaty of peace, which he was expected to defend in the Lords, in the same terms as the preliminaries, but he did not resign, to avoid upsetting the ministry. By 1803 Addington was eager to remove him from the Home Office, where he was said to be appallingly negligent, and in March Pelham played into his hands by expressing willingness to retire in order to facilitate a junction with Pitt. This did not take place, but in August Addington unscrupulously replaced him with Charles Yorke, and offered the consolation of the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster and the presidency of the Board of Trade, with a seat in the cabinet, together with &#145;some patent office in reversion&#146;. Pelham, who was seriously ill at this time, initially declined active cabinet office and wrote directly to the king asking to be restored to the head of the Sussex militia. Justifiably bitter towards Addington, he detailed his grievances in a further letter to the king on 13 September 1803. Later that month he applied for the duchy of Lancaster for life, to mark the king's approval of his conduct as home secretary and as insurance against dismissal if, as he thought likely, he found himself at odds with his colleagues on Irish policy. The king vetoed this, but it was indicated to Pelham that an alternative provision would be made for him when available, and in November 1803 he took the duchy, outside the cabinet, and &#145;subject &hellip; to the contingencies to which other ofices held during pleasure are liable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Correspondence of George III</span>, 4.134n). Pitt discarded him on his return to power in May 1804, encouraging him to take a diplomatic post, which he declined, or the place of captain of the yeomen of the guard, which he also turned down after hesitating for two days. When he surrendered his seals the king, who was possibly unhinged, and without having consulted Pitt, physically forced the official stick of the captain of the yeomen on him. A distraught Pelham, believing that Pitt had tricked him into what he regarded as a degradation, resigned it almost immediately and in so doing angered the king, who to Pitt condemned his &#145;frequent political tergiversation&#146;  (ibid., 4.204).<br>
<br>On his father's death on 8 January 1805, Pelham succeeded as second earl of Chichester and to the family's Stanmer estate between Brighton and Lewes, where he initiated agricultural improvements. He refused an offer of the government of the Cape from the Grenville ministry in March 1806, but on the formation of Portland's second administration in the following year became joint postmaster-general, at &pound;2500 a year. He retained the office in the ministries of Perceval and Liverpool and was sole postmaster from November 1823 until his death at his London house in Stratton Street on 4 July 1826. Lord Holland described him as &#145;somewhat timeserving&#146;, but &#145;a good-natured and prudent man&#146;  (Holland, 1.112). He was succeeded in the peerage by his eldest surviving son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21791/', "Henry Thomas Pelham (1804&#150;1886)")</script>, the future ecclesiastical commissioner. His other sons were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21794/', "John Thomas Pelham (1811&#150;1894)")</script>, bishop of Norwich, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21787/', "Frederick Thomas Pelham (1808&#150;1861)")</script>, a naval officer.<br>
