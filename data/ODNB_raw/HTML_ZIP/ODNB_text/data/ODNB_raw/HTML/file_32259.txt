<span class="headword">Camm, Sir  Sydney</span>  (1893&#150;1966), <span class="occ">aircraft designer</span>, was born in Windsor on 5 August 1893, the eldest of twelve children of Frederick Camm, journeyman carpenter and joiner, and his wife, Mary Smith. At the Royal Free School at Windsor his interest in aviation was awakened at an early age through the construction of elementary flying models. Soon after he left school Camm became an apprentice woodworker, helped to set up the Windsor Model Aeroplane Club, and became its secretary at the age of nineteen. Stimulated by his efforts, the club rapidly progressed from models to the design and building of a man-carrying glider which flew in December 1912. It was followed by a powered aircraft project, and Camm's leading role in these activities was cut short only by the outbreak of war in 1914.<br>
<br>With his knowledge of practical woodworking and theoretical aerodynamics Camm had no difficulty in joining the Martinsyde aeroplane company at Brooklands. There he remained throughout the war, rising through the practical working levels to first minor and then major design tasks on Martinsyde aircraft. It was during this period that he learned his profession, taking every opportunity to study and write articles about all available types of British and captured enemy aircraft. Thus, when he was elected an associate fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1918, he was able to describe himself as a technical journalist.<br>
<br>After the war, Martinsyde declined from lack of orders and closed in 1921. G. H. Handasyde continued as an independent designer and took on Camm as his assistant, and together they designed an advanced glider. R. P. Raynham, the Martinsyde test pilot, took Camm with him as mechanic when he competed in the first king's cup race in 1922 with a Martinsyde F4.<br>
<br>In the same year Raynham joined the Hawker Engineering Company at Kingston upon Thames and when Camm's work with Handasyde finished, in 1923, he followed his friend into this famous firm, in which he was to work with the greatest distinction for the next forty-three years. He was already an expert in detail design and practical workmanship, and much preoccupied with the aeronautical virtues of simplicity, symmetry, and lightness. He joined as a senior draughtsman; such was his ability that he became chief designer only two years later. At this period aircraft could still be designed and built cheaply and quickly, and Camm was charged with the supervision of the design of a light biplane, the Cygnet. This remarkable little two-seater won many light aircraft competitions in 1925 and 1926, and clearly showed his gifts for imaginative conception, excellence of detail, and careful weight control. Camm was directed, from 1925 onwards, to the development of future military types. He produced two biplane aircraft, the Heron in 1925, which used metal for the main structure, and the Hornbill in 1926, the basic design from which his future bomber and fighter types were developed.<br>
<br>In 1928 the emergence of the Hawker Hart day bomber with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine produced the first characteristically Camm aircraft. It was notable for grace, balance of design, and the complete integration of the engine within the aircraft, contrasting strongly with most contemporary aeroplanes whose engines often appeared to have been added as an afterthought. The Hart was adopted by the Royal Air Force, and with its variants the Hind, Audax, Osprey, and Nimrod was also sold to a large number of foreign air forces, so that finally some 3000 were built. A single-seater redesign of the Hart produced a high performance fighter named the Fury, which was similarly sold all over the world and is widely held to have been the most beautiful biplane ever flown. The Hart and Fury put Hawker back on the map.<br>
<br>The Supermarine and Gloster companies were engaged in producing the monoplanes associated with the Schneider Trophy, but Hawkers had not been drawn in. Camm, and Hawkers, decided, however, that the firm's future lay in the construction of fast fighter aircraft. By 1933 Camm realized that he could go no further with biplane designs, and he began the study of a fighter monoplane to be built round the new Rolls-Royce Merlin. In 1934 the Air Ministry issued specification F. 36/34 for a monoplane eight-gun fighter, and the new Hawker design was thereafter produced to this specification, in close co-operation with the ministry's operational requirements branch. It was named the Hurricane.<br>
<br>This was the first monoplane fighter supplied to the Royal Air Force, 100 m.p.h. faster than anything previously flown, and it went into production under the shadow of impending war. This urgency caused Camm to allow some compromises in design which he would not otherwise have permitted, but the aircraft was fast, manoeuvrable, and sturdy. It was in full production by the outbreak of war in 1939 and formed the major part of the strength of Fighter Command during the battle of Britain, so earning the major credit in the winning of that decisive battle. Hurricanes also fought in Europe, Africa, Burma, and over the oceans, first armed with eight machine-guns, later carrying bombs, rockets, and cannon. Some thousands were supplied to Russia, and a total of some 14,500 were finally built. As for the pilots of Fighter Command, 1940 provided Camm's finest hour. He was made CBE in 1941, prompting the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> to hail him as the man who saved Britain. By the outbreak of war Camm was already well into the design of the Hurricane's successor, the Typhoon. When the Normandy invasion was launched in 1944 Typhoon fighter&#150;bombers were present in large quantities, and Camm, driving himself and his team relentlessly through years of continual and intensive work, was producing the Tempest. This very powerful fighter, derived from the Typhoon and itself the parent of the Sea Fury, achieved the ultimate in the exploitation of propeller-driven monoplanes; indeed, the Tempest and Sea Fury were so fast and robust that they served on until the fifties, well into the jet era.<br>
<br>The advent of the jet engine in 1942 was a powerful stimulant to a designer with Camm's special interests, and before the war was over his team was directed on to studies using the new engine. Others were ahead of him, and owing to the post-war relaxation his new jet-driven design was not needed until 1948, when the navy ordered it for carrier work and named it the Sea Hawk. This too was a successful project for peacetime military sales, 500 being built and supplied to a number of navies. The well-marked line of his design progress was continued with its successor, the Hunter. In this aircraft Camm pushed performance to the limit possible with subsonic aircraft, and once more he brought forth an outstanding machine, carrying all the distinctive marks of his design genius. Two thousand were built and sold, in 1953 it gained the world air speed record, and the Hunter was still in operational service twenty years after its first flight.<br>
<br>Camm's next logical step was to design a supersonic fighter, and this he did in a number of variants, but owing to chance and government policy none were built, a denial which he resented greatly. Instead, he embarked on studies with Bristol Siddeley Engines of a possible combination of a special engine and airframe, which would give the flying characteristics of a high-performance fighter together with the landing and take-off of a helicopter. This concept, VTOL (vertical take-off and landing), permitted a number of different solutions, but the gifted Bristol Siddeley engine designer, Stanley George Hooker, favoured a single engine with vectored thrust, giving the ability to swivel the thrust of the engine downwards under the control of the pilot. Such a system required a completely new control system based on reaction jets, for that phase of flight in which the aircraft had insufficient speed for normal control. It is a proof of Camm's persistent character in design that, though revolutionary in concept, the resulting fighter looked much like the others of its line. However, it added a completely new dimension to military aviation, releasing aircraft from the prepared bases on which they had always been at their most vulnerable and bringing them nearer to the areas where they needed to fight. Such a radical step took much time to evolve, mainly owing to timidity by the customers, and its development exercised him from 1958 until his death.<br>
<br>As an aircraft designer Camm was pre-eminent during the exciting early years of aviation. Circumstances placed him in a position in which, by his undoubted design genius, he made a major contribution to the outcome of one of the great battles of history. He worked so hard for most of his life that, though not without other interests, his history is inseparable from the aircraft projects he fathered and carried through. He was a tall, lean man, of quick speech and mercurial disposition. As his success and prestige grew, the same self-confidence which displayed his signature on each one of his aircraft showed also in a growing intolerance of questioning or opposition. He fiercely resented criticism of any of his projects, and persistent overwork brought this quality at times to the borderline of eccentricity, although his angriest outbursts, after a subsequent period of brooding solitude, might be succeeded by a reasonable assimilation of the criticism into his own opinion. He drove his staff hard, and his opinions of officialdom were more often than not unprintable. However, although not himself a pilot, Camm was always sympathetic to those who had to test and fly his aircraft. In an era when individual design was possible he could be regarded as one of the last of the great individual designers, whose personality and name could never be submerged in any committee or project team.<br>
<br>Camm was elected a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1932, received the society's gold medal in 1958, served as president in 1954&#150;5, and was elected honorary fellow in 1961. From 1951 to 1953 he was chairman of the technical board of the Society of British Aircraft Constructors. He was knighted in 1953. He received a number of foreign professional honours, of which the chief was the Daniel Guggenheim medal, which he received in 1965. He was elected to the board of Hawker Siddeley Aviation in 1935 and served until his death while playing golf at Richmond, Surrey, on 12 March 1966. His home was at Thames Ditton. He was survived by his wife, Hilda Rose Starnes, whom he married in 1915 and who died in 1977, and by one daughter. In 1984, on the occasion of Camm's investment in the International Hall of Aerospace Fame at San Diego, California (where he was then only the seventh Briton to be thus honoured), his daughter spoke of the father she had known: &#145;To the world at large he was a reticent figure, austere and reserved&#151;a perfectionist in his profession. In private he had a well-developed sense of humour and derived great enjoyment from reading Damon Runyon and Evelyn Waugh's novels&#146;  (Fozard, <span class="italic">Aeronautical Journal</span>, 144). His tastes in music were conventional and apart from a passion for golf, he enjoyed the simple pleasures of life.<br>
