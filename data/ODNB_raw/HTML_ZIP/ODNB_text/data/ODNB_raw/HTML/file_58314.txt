<span class="headword">Nursey,  Perry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1771, <em>d.</em> 1840), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was baptized at Stonham Aspal, Suffolk, on 25 June 1771, the second son of John Nursey, a surgeon apothecary, and his wife, Catherine Fairfax (<i>c</i>.1742&#150;1827).<br>
<br>Nursey followed his father's profession as a surgeon, having probably been his apprentice. He entered a practice at Woodbridge in 1794, perhaps not long after which he became surgeon to the workhouse at Melton, close by. In 1795 he eloped to Scotland with Anne Simpson (<i>c</i>.1776&#150;1844), the heir to an estate at Little Bealings, between Ipswich and Woodbridge, and a ward in chancery, and there they married. He gave addresses in London in 1799 and 1801, though he was almost certainly living at Little Bealings by the end of 1799. There, at The Grove, he &#145;laid out the grounds in the best style of ornamental planting&#146;  (Page, 43). In 1814 he published an <span class="italic">Essay on Picturesque Gardening, Planting, and Rural Improvements</span>, in which he related the man-made scene to paintings by seventeenth-century masters of classical landscape, such as Claude. He was credited by J. C. Loudon with having discerned, in or before 1816, a variety of the black poplar (<i>Populus nigra viridis</i>).<br>
<br>In 1832 Nursey was referred to as an architect and landscape gardener. He had sold The Grove in 1826&#150;7 and moved to Foxhall nearby, where he built himself a house; he was living there in 1831. He altered the exterior of Theberton Hall between 1830 and 1834, probably having done the same to The Grove for its new owner. In 1832 he was occupying a friend's house, Foxburrow Hill (now Foxboro Hall), outside Melton. Designated an architect, of Melton, he was declared bankrupt on 31 December 1833; there had already, in 1822, been a passing suggestion of financial insecurity. A forced auction of his art collection was held at Foxburrow on 10&#150;11 April 1834. Advertisements for it in the <span class="italic">Ipswich Journal</span> offered some 350 prints after old masters, gathered with some emphasis on the seventeenth century and on landscape; 100 prints after Thomas Gainsborough; 43 drawings by David Wilkie; 25 pictures with attributions&#151;probably unreliable&#151;to seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painters; finally, 150 paintings and sketches by himself, cried up as &#145;vivid and faithful transcripts&#146; of local scenery  (<span class="italic">Ipswich Journal</span>, 7, 26 March 1834).<br>
<br>According to Dawson Turner, Nursey had an &#145;enthusiastic love for the art [of painting], that I have seldom, if ever, known exceeded&#146;  (Turner, 87). It is, indeed, as an amateur landscape painter that he is still faintly remembered. Much of his work was done in oils, generally on a modest scale; he painted out of doors, and his subjects were frequently topographical. He appears to have had some instruction, probably when young, from Alexander Nasmyth, for whose manner of landscape painting his own sometimes came to be mistaken. None of his work can now be securely identified. Nothing by him is recorded as in a public collection, but several works remain known through reproductive prints. He exhibited some landscapes at the Royal Academy in 1799 and 1801, and another in 1830 with the Norwich Society of Artists, with whom he also exhibited a portrait. At the British Institution in 1815 he exhibited a large picture of an episode in the Peninsular War, based on a drawing by a witness. In London, W. P. Frith derided his landscapes for having a greenness beyond old-masterly sanction. His admirers were, rather, among his country neighbours. The poet Edward Fitzgerald, a poor judge of pictures, owned a number of his works and was indulgently content to find in them a &#145;genuine feeling of Nature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 1.213). Another literary friend and admirer in the district, again no judge, was Bernard Barton. Conferring more credit on Nursey, although not necessarily as a painter, is a reference to him in a letter by John Constable, written from London in 1814 to the elder John Dunthorne. Although concerned with one of his own pictures, Constable's words imply that both he and his correspondent knew Nursey, and that he heeded his opinion. There is no record of their further association, but pictures by Nursey have passed occasionally (and optimistically) as by Constable. A glimpse of Nursey's responsiveness to older masters of landscape is allowed by Thomas Green, who noted in 1821 that he &#145;looked with ecstasy at my Hobbema&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 456).<br>
<br>Nursey's particular relationship was not, however, with any landscapist but with Wilkie, whom he came to know by 1814, possibly through the piano maker William Stodart. In the warmer months of 1816, 1818, 1822, and 1823 Wilkie made short visits to The Grove, where he and Nursey painted. Nursey enjoyed Wilkie's technical experience, also learning through making copies of his pictures. Wilkie, himself diffident about painting landscape, was with little doubt spurred on in the endeavour by Nursey's enthusiasm for it. As well as the drawings by Wilkie already mentioned, Nursey collected prints after his pictures and found local buyers for them. Their easy friendship was shared by their families, and was strengthened by an attachment formed between Nursey's eldest son, Robert, and Wilkie's sister Helen. Robert died in 1824 while staying with Wilkie. In 1825 Wilkie left for three years on the continent, and soon afterwards the Nurseys moved from Little Bealings. These events appear to have dissolved the relationship. Wilkie has left an expressive drawing of Nursey, made in 1823 and now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.<br>
<br>The impression left of Nursey in the country is of a convivial man, esteemed in his neighbourhood, churchgoing and attentive to the poor. He left Suffolk for London after 1834, perhaps after 1837, and died at his home, 3 Broadley Terrace, Marylebone, on 12 January 1840.<br>
<br>Famously, Nursey proclaimed his commitment to art by naming five of his ten children after painters. His youngest son, Claude Lorraine Richard Wilson (1816&#150;1873), taught in schools of art at Leeds, Bradford, Belfast, and Norwich, and was said to have been one of Wilkie's assistants. Nursey's second son, also Perry (1799&#150;1867), became a clergyman, a poet, and a painter of landscapes which are sometimes confused with his father's.<br>
