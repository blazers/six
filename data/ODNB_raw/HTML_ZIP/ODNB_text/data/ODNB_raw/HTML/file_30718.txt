</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benson,  Robert Hugh</span>  (1871&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and writer</span>, was the fourth son and youngest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2139/', "Edward White Benson (1829&#150;1896)")</script> and his wife, Mary Sidgwick (1841&#150;1918), a second cousin. He was born on 18 November 1871 at Wellington College, of which his father was the first headmaster. In 1872 Edward Benson was appointed chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral and moved to Lincoln; in 1877 he became bishop of the new diocese of Truro, and in 1882 archbishop of Canterbury, from which date the Bensons had Lambeth Palace and Addington Court, near Croydon, for their homes. These romantic surroundings ever coloured the imagination of Robert Hugh Benson, and he inherited, and early displayed, a high-strung and dramatically responsive temperament. He was also hopelessly spoiled and indulged as a child. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30712/', "Arthur Christopher Benson")</script>, later master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and also the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30713/', "Edward Frederic Benson")</script>. His sisters were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56097/', "Mary Eleanor Benson")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56291/', "Margaret Benson")</script>.<br>
<br>In 1882 Benson went to a preparatory school at Clevedon, Somerset, and in 1885 gained a scholarship at Eton College, where he stayed until 1889. Not idle, he yet showed no interest in study, nor any remarkable religious sense, but ended by winning the Hervey prize for a poem on Father Damien. At Wren's collegiate establishment, a crammer where he prepared unsuccessfully for a year for the Indian Civil Service, <span class="italic">John Inglesant</span> (1880) by J. H. Shorthouse made a lasting impression on him. In October 1890 he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1893. He was only moderately successful in classics, but he began theology, as he had decided to take holy orders. Wagner, Swedenborgianism, mesmerism, and climbing in the Alps were among his interests.<br>
<br>Prepared for the diaconate by Charles John Vaughan, dean of Llandaff, Benson was ordained deacon in 1894, not without a sharp mental struggle due, seemingly, to a fear of the irrevocable. After a retreat in which Father Basil Maturin, still an Anglican, gave him much spiritual and intellectual help, he was ordained a priest in the Church of England (1895), and until the autumn of 1896 he worked in the Eton mission at Hackney Wick among poor people who loved him more than he liked them. After his father's death in October 1896 he went to Egypt, whence Anglicanism &#145;seemed provincial&#146;. From May 1897 until June 1898 he was curate at Kemsing, near Sevenoaks, but fled, for discipline, to the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield, Yorkshire. Benson's views about the sacraments developed fast, but some lectures by Charles Gore, then superior of the community, unsettled him: he began to see no alternative but authority or scepticism.<br>
<br>In 1903 Benson returned to his home and in September of that year was received into the Roman communion at Woodchester, Gloucestershire. Given his background, he was regarded as &#145;the supreme catch of a convert from the very arms of Canterbury&#146;  (Masters, 206). However, his family felt the conversion made him &#145;smug and insufferably pontifical&#146;  (ibid., 162), however much they continued to love him.<br>
<br>Benson had already written <span class="italic">The Light Invisible</span>, a very popular semi-mystical fiction (1903); in 1904 appeared <span class="italic">By what Authority?</span>, a vivid story of the Elizabethan religious revolution. The months from November 1903 to June 1904 were spent at San Silvestro, Rome, and, after ordination as a Roman Catholic priest in 1904, he returned to England, and at Llandaff House, Cambridge, read theology and wrote <span class="italic">The King's Achievement</span> (1905) on Henry VIII, <span class="italic">The Queen's Tragedy</span> (1906) on Mary Tudor, and <span class="italic">The History of Richard Raynal, Solitary</span> (1906), fiction disguised as history, being an account of a hermit in Henry VI's reign. He migrated in 1905 to the rectory, Cambridge, and there wrote novels of modern life: <span class="italic">The Sentimentalists</span> (1906), <span class="italic">The Conventionalists</span> (1908)&#151;studies of rather abnormal, and also of very average, temperaments; <span class="italic">A Mirror of Shalott</span> (1907), <span class="italic">The Papers of a Pariah</span> (1907)&#151;studies of Roman Catholic ritual as from without; and <span class="italic">The Lord of the World</span> (1907), a sensational description of the coming of Antichrist. Lesser works of this period were <span class="italic">A City Set on an Hill</span> (1904) and <span class="italic">An Alphabet of Saints</span> (1905).<br>
<br>Benson bought and quaintly adorned an old house at Hare Street, Buntingford, Hertfordshire, where he lived from 1908 until his death, carving, embroidering, gardening, entertaining friends, and writing. The books belonging to this period were: <span class="italic">The Necromancers</span> (1909) on spiritualism, <span class="italic">A Winnowing</span> (1910), <span class="italic">None other Gods</span> (1910), <span class="italic">The Coward</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Come Rack, Come Rope</span> (1912), <span class="italic">An Average Man</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Oddsfish</span> (1914) on Charles II, <span class="italic">Initiation</span> (1914), a study of pain, and <span class="italic">Loneliness</span> (1915). He also printed some sermons, <span class="italic">The Religion of the Plain Man</span> (1906), <span class="italic">Christ in the Church</span> (1911), <span class="italic">The Friendship of Christ</span> (1912), and <span class="italic">Paradoxes of Catholicism</span> (1913), four short religious plays, as well as some war prayers and poems.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most unfortunate friendship of Benson's life was with the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37910/', "Frederick Rolfe (Baron Corvo)")</script>. The two proposed to collaborate on a life of Thomas Becket. However, not only did Rolfe prove impossible to work with, but Benson &#145;was advised that it was hardly suitable to have his name coupled on the title-page with a Venetian pimp and procuror of boys&#146;  (Masters, 207). In the event, the life of Becket appeared in 1910 under Benson's name alone. Rolfe is said to have cruelly satirized Benson in <span class="italic">The Desire and Pursuit of the Whole</span> (1934).<br>
<br>Benson was immensely popular as a preacher, although his manner was violent owing to his stammer, and his voice shrill. However, his brother E. F. Benson referred to his &#145;tumultuous eloquence&#146; and to the &#145;flawless, flame-like delivery of his sermons&#146;  (Masters, 207). Benson visited Rome and America more than once, preaching and lecturing, had a vast correspondence, and poured forth press articles on innumerable subjects; but he lacked leisure, patience, and health to deal adequately with his materials. <span class="italic">By what Authority?</span>, at once well documented, vigorous, and tender, and <span class="italic">None other Gods</span>, with strong characterization, varied incident, and many mystical touches, not superadded to but expressed through the normal, were perhaps the best specimens of his two styles of writing. But his astounding vitality was infused into all his books; the charm of his boyish enthusiasm won him a welcome everywhere; his friendships were warm; but they were none too lasting when he lost interest, save within his family where the influence of his mother remained paramount with him. Athirst for experience, he used fully every lesson he had learned, yet his piety remained childlike and his faith fierce. In 1911 he was made private chamberlain to Pius X.<br>
<br>Benson's death was due to pneumonia supervening on false angina, and to the ruin of his nervous system by feverish yet systematic overwork. He died at Bishop's House, 250 Chapel Street, Salford, on 19 October 1914, in the presence of his brother Arthur Christopher Benson, to whom he was devoted. He bequeathed his house in Hare Street to the church as a residence for archbishops of Westminster. A morbid side to Benson's nature was manifest in his will. This gave elaborate instructions for burial in a tomb which could be opened from the inside, in case he was entombed while still alive.<br>
<br>One of the most high profile converts to Roman Catholicism of his day, Benson was a Catholic author of suggestive power. Discussing his conversion, the <span class="italic">Catholic Who's Who</span> noted that few had converted &#145;with so high a sense of responsibility and so entire a devotion of &hellip; time and interests to the service of the Church&#146;.<br>
