<span class="headword">Holden, Sir  Edward Hopkinson</span>, first baronet  (1848&#150;1919), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 11 May 1848 at the Bull's Head, Tottington, Lancashire, the elder son of Henry Holden (1823&#150;1876), calico bleacher, and later beer seller, and his wife, Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hopkinson (1826&#150;1891). He was educated locally at the Wesleyan elementary school in Summerseat, and on leaving school became a clerk in local shops and warehouses. His banking career started in 1866, when he began an apprenticeship at the Bolton branch of the Manchester and County Bank. After seven years he was promoted to a clerkship at the Manchester head office and remained there for another seven years. This seemingly slow progress belied an obviously determined young man, who attended evening classes in political economy, law, and logic at Owens College, Manchester, in a rigorous programme of self-education.<br>
<br>In 1881 Holden answered an advertisement in <span class="italic">The Economist</span> for the post of accountant at the Birmingham and Midland Bank at a salary of &pound;300. Asked about his ambitions at his interview, he is reputed to have said, &#145;I want to be the manager of a big bank.&#146; At that time Midland was still a small Birmingham company with only a scattering of branches in the region. However, the appointment of John Dent Goodman as chairman in 1881 heralded a policy of expansion within the bank, in which Holden was to be deeply involved.<br>
<br>As accountant Holden proved his worth in a managerial role, overseeing bank premises and the recruitment of staff. In 1883 he was on the verge of leaving the bank; its lack of commercial progress did not fit his ambitions. The bank directors retained him by promoting him to secretary, and later in that year Holden jointly supervised the acquisition of the Union Bank of Birmingham. This venture was to be the first of many amalgamations over the next thirty years. The targets selected were usually joint stock banks from the north or the midlands which had strong industrial links. Among those banks which amalgamated with Midland under Holden's firm hand were the Preston Banking Company in 1894, the Leicestershire Banking Company in 1900, and the Yorkshire Banking Company in 1901.<br>
<br>Holden was heavily involved in the process of amalgamation, both in picking suitable banks, and as a negotiator. His rise through the bank (sub-manager in 1887, general manager in 1890, and joint general manager in 1891) mirrored the success of the bank as it became an organization of national importance. In 1891 Midland entered London with its purchase of the Central Bank of London, giving the bank a seat in the London Clearing House for the first time. In 1895 the Midland's directors voted Holden 2000 guineas for his &#145;conspicuous ability in conducting and completing the recent amalgamations&#146;  (HSBC Group Archives, board minutes, 19 Feb 1895). In these negotiations, mostly held in railway hotels up and down the country, Holden was a formidable presence, meticulous in his scrutiny of bad and doubtful debts, and merciless with those bankers whose knowledge of their own balance sheets did not match his own. A director of the City Bank, on joining the board of Midland, stated: &#145;how glad I am to have him on the same side of the table as myself, for I know what it is to have a table between us&#146;  (HSBC Group Archives, report of the general meeting of shareholders, January 1899). This amalgamation with the City Bank in 1898 was the most risky of all Holden's acquisitions&#151;he conducted the negotiations alone, and for the first and last time he had to win over opposition from a section of his directors and shareholders regarding the price to be paid. This amalgamation brought Midland to a prestigious new headquarters in Threadneedle Street, and to its position as the fourth largest clearing bank in the UK.<br>
<br>Promotion to managing director followed later in 1898, and Holden was to hold this position until 1919 at a salary of &pound;5000. In the next ten years he concentrated on centralizing and unifying the structure of the bank; a necessary task, given that it was composed of different provincial businesses, each with its own traditions and methods. Uniformity in accounting was introduced throughout the branches, and all lending decisions were made in London. Holden's diaries show his meticulous attention to detail, even over the minutiae of decisions relating to staff and premises. A series of visits to North America in the early years of the twentieth century inspired him to modernize the bank's office systems&#151;a large internal telephone network was introduced, office machinery was more widely used, and printing and stationery was standardized. During one of these visits, one journalist described him thus: &#145;no dreamer,&#151;he moves quickly, thinks rapidly. Grey moustached and ruddy, he had a pair of decidedly electric eyes. He talks political economy as easily as some men talk horses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Toronto News</span>, 24 Sept 1904).<br>
<br>In the early years of the twentieth century, with the bank strongly placed in its home markets, Holden began to look further afield for new business. He used his American visits as an opportunity to extend the bank's correspondent network, and in 1905 the bank established a foreign exchange department in London, the first of the clearers to take such a step. The bank also became involved in loans and new issues for foreign governments and major international companies. Holden was especially interested in the opportunities in Russia; Midland issued bonds for a Russian railway loan in 1909, and in 1917 opened a branch office in St Petersburg.<br>
<br>Holden became chairman of Midland in 1908. Although less involved in the day to day running of the bank, in amalgamations he continued to select targets and conduct preliminary negotiations. Important amalgamations during these years included the North and South Wales Bank in 1908, the Metropolitan Bank in 1914, and the London Joint Stock Bank in 1918. The last brought the Midland's total deposits to &pound;349 million, making it the largest bank in the world. This amalgamation was opposed by some in the press and in parliament, on the grounds that such mergers would reduce competition between the banks. A parliamentary committee, the Colwyn committee, was appointed to investigate the issue. Holden replied characteristically that Britain should be mindful of the international banking world. If British banks were to compete in a world arena then they would need to be able to match the capitalization and deposits of their rivals. The amalgamation proceeded as planned and the government rejected the committee's proposal to legislate against further amalgamations.<br>
<br>In his role as Midland's chairman, Holden was also a spokesman and leader of the banking community. His annual speeches to his shareholders were used to expound his views on financial policy and were eagerly awaited, both in England and on the other side of the Atlantic. He argued, against the Bank of England, that the clearing banks needed to hold their own gold reserves; he also argued that the country should maintain its own gold-based war chest. These views, backed by Holden's Liberalism and support of free trade, recommended him to Asquith. Holden had been MP for Heywood, Manchester, since 1906, but had kept a low profile, fearing that to seek success in politics would open the bank to criticism. However, in 1910 Asquith recommended him for chancellor of the exchequer. Lloyd George's threat to resign ensured the withdrawal of this recommendation, and later that year Holden did not seek re-election at the polls. Thereafter he remained an informal adviser to the government on financial matters. In the period prior to the outbreak of the First World War he returned to the issue of gold reserves, requesting that a royal commission be appointed to investigate the matter. On the outbreak of war, Holden recommended to Lloyd George the declaration of a moratorium on lending, and was credited with the idea of issuing currency notes. In September 1915 he joined Lord Reading in a special commission to New York to negotiate the stabilization of exchange rates. Following this, he helped to raise the Anglo-French loan of &pound;100 million, for which the United States government agreed to waive collateral.<br>
<br>Holden's influence had helped him to mobilize the support of the clearing banks for the Yorkshire Penny Bank in 1911, when it faced a crisis due to the depreciation of its securities. In 1916 he persuaded the Treasury to join the banks in guaranteeing the Penny Bank's reserves when they faced another crisis. Holden also campaigned for reforms in the Institute of Bankers, and was successful in his attempts to bring increased democracy and a greater range of activities for the ordinary members.<br>
<br>By habit and by inclination, Holden was a hard worker who found it difficult to take holidays. Despite his sometimes autocratic style of management, his staff often found him to be a considerate and forgiving employer. Outside the bank, Holden had few interests. He established a freemasons' lodge in 1902, the Holden Lodge; membership was restricted to the bank's directors and staff. He was an omnivorous reader of books concerning finance, and a keen golfer and cyclist.<br>
<br>Holden married Annie (<i>d</i>. 1905), daughter of William Cassie of Aberdeen, on 6 January 1877; they had known each other since their youth at Summerseat. Their family home was The Grange, at Thorpe, Chertsey, in Surrey, where Holden was a church steward. They had two sons and a daughter. Their elder son, Cassie, continued the family influence in the bank, becoming a director and deputy chairman after a career as a barrister. Holden was created a baronet in 1909, and twice declined a peerage. He died suddenly, on 23 July 1919, at Duff House Sanatorium in Banff, of cerebral thrombosis and heart failure, after a week's illness. His will was sworn at under &pound;100,000, and included an endowment fund for education in the principles and practice of international banking. He was buried in the Wesleyan chapel in Summerseat, Lancashire, with his wife.<br>
