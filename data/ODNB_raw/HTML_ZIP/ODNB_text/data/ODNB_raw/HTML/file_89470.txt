<span class="headword">Young,  Edward Preston</span>  (1913&#150;2003), <span class="occ">designer and submariner</span>, was born on 17 November 1913 in San Fernando, Trinidad, the son of William Young (<i>d</i>. after 1956), general trader. Following the family's move to England, Young attended Highgate School, London. Despite showing little interest in most academic disciplines, he developed a proficiency in English literature and, on leaving school aged seventeen, sought work in the publishing industry. An unsuccessful interview with Stanley Unwin led him to the offices of The Bodley Head, a well-established but financially troubled firm of which the youthful Allen Lane became chairman in 1930. Lane employed him as a junior clerk and, with his interest in typography and design, Young soon became responsible for many of the company's press advertisements.<br>
<br>In 1934 Lane made the decision to establish a series of high-quality but inexpensive paperback titles. Impressed by the colophon used by the German publisher Albatross, he wanted his own imprint to be named after an animal or bird. Various suggestions were considered before Lane's secretary, Joan Coles, suggested a penguin. Lane duly sent Young to London Zoo to sketch the birds. Young's drawing, and the resulting penguin colophon&#151;jaunty, playful, and appealing&#151;came to symbolize a revolution in British reading habits. By reprinting established hardback titles in cheap paperbound editions, Lane's new company, Penguin Books, vastly expanded the audience for quality literature and was recognized, alongside institutions such as the BBC, as an agency for popular education. Penguin, as Young later recalled, &#145;[got] rid of the idea that the only people who wanted cheap editions belonged to a lower order of intelligence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Book Collector</span>, 1952, 210). In his role as the firm's first production manager, Young created a design template that captured Lane's tastes and publishing values. The gaudy pictorial covers of most existing paperbacks were rejected in favour of a plain, stylish aesthetic that carried an aura of modest respectability. Two bands of solid colour at the top and bottom of the cover were separated by a clear white panel on which the author's name and book title were printed in Eric Gill's sans serif font, with the colour schemes of the upper and lower bands corresponding with different genres: orange for fiction, green for crime, dark blue for biography, and cerise for adventure. To emulate their more prestigious hardback equivalents, Young also provided Penguin Books with dustcovers that replicated the cover image. When the <span class="roman">Pelican</span> imprint was created as a format for the firm's original non-fiction in 1937, Young produced a second colophon of a serious-looking bird that projected the educational tone of the works it adorned. It remained in use until a minor redesign was carried out by William Grimmond in 1947.<br>
<br>In July 1939 Young left Penguin for financial reasons and joined another paperback publisher, Reprint Books. However, his tenure in the firm was interrupted by the onset of the Second World War. A keen yachtsman, Young entered the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant and, after receiving training in Sussex, undertook his first patrol in the submarine <i>H28</i> in October 1940. After being transferred to HMS <i>Umpire</i> in July 1941, he narrowly escaped when the boat was accidentally rammed and sunk by a trawler that was escorting a convoy off the Norfolk coast. Young was one of two men who successfully escaped, without equipment, from the conning tower as the submarine lay on the seabed. Twenty-two men were drowned in the disaster.<br>
<br>Following periods of service in the north Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Young was ordered to take the commanding officer's qualifying course in early 1943. Having passed this notoriously challenging programme, he became the first RNVR officer to captain an operational submarine when he took command of HMS <i>P555</i> on 23 March 1943. From June 1943 until the end of hostilities Young commanded the newly built HMS <i>Storm</i> on patrols with the Far Eastern Fleet, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. While at sea he attempted to boost the morale of his men by writing light-hearted news sheets that informed them about destinations and future plans. He was promoted commander on his return to Britain in April 1945, and finished his naval career in a staff post on HMS <i>Cyclops</i> stationed on the Isle of Arran.<br>
<br>On 14 April 1945, at Westminster register office, Young married Diana Lilian Jequier (1916&#150;2003), daughter of George Augustus Graves, restaurateur. The couple had two daughters, and in the year of his marriage Young returned to publishing as the production manager for Pan Books. However, he left a year later to become the director of a new firm&#151;Rupert Hart-Davis&#151;which adopted an image and editorial style that was more akin to the Penguin model he had helped to establish before the war. It was Rupert Hart-Davis who first published Young's best-selling war memoir, <span class="italic">One of our Submarines</span> (1952), which Penguin, in honour of their first production manager, reprinted as its 1000th title in 1954. A modest account written in cheerful and accessible prose, the book was a fitting symbol of the achievements of its author and publisher, and remains in print in the twenty-first century. Following the dissolution of his first marriage, Young married, on 7 July 1956 at St Marylebone register office, Mary Reoch Cressall (1915&#150;2001), the daughter of Thomas Strang, tea merchant.<br>
<br>Over the next decade Young wrote more non-fiction books on a range of topics, including <span class="italic">Forty Years of Motoring</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">Look at Submarines</span> (1964). In 1970 he became managing director of the Rainbird Group before retiring three years later to Domme in the Dordogne, where he and Mary wrote the <span class="italic">Shell Guide to France</span> (1979). In his later years Young returned to England and lived at Rustington, Sussex. He died, at Lobswood House residential home, Littlehampton, on 28 January 2003. He was survived by the two daughters of his first marriage, and his first wife, who died in March of that year. Though less prevalent in Penguin's published output from the 1960s, Young's original banded cover design has continued to exert a significant influence on the company's image and in associated brands. In 2009 a set of postage stamps marking classic British design included Young's Penguin cover for Vita Sackville-West's <span class="italic">The Edwardians</span>.<br>
