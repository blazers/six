<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bannatyne, Sir  William Macleod</span>, Lord Bannatyne  (1744&#150;1833), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 26 January 1744, perhaps in Edinburgh, the son of Roderick Macleod (<i>d</i>. 1784) of Sunbank, writer to the signet, and his first wife, Isabel (<i>fl</i>. 1736&#150;1744), daughter of Hector Bannatyne of Kames. He was admitted as a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 22 January 1765. Through his mother he succeeded to the estate of Kames, in Bute, when he assumed the name Bannatyne, and he was appointed sheriff of Bute in February 1776. Although letters of 1802&#150;3 show that he hoped to marry a Miss Brisbane, this suit was unsuccessful, and he never married.<br>
<br>Bannatyne was one of the political group which gathered around Henry Erskine, a Scottish branch of the opposition whig connection, which hindered his professional ambition in the alarmist 1790s. When he asked his patron, John Stuart, fourth earl of Bute, to try to secure a place on the bench for him in March 1795, Bute reported that Bannatyne's attendance at a dinner held in Edinburgh in honour of Charles James Fox's birthday in January that year had excluded him from consideration. Bannatyne argued strenuously and persistently that his political views were very moderate, and he was eventually allowed to take a gown at the court of session on 16 May 1799 as Lord Bannatyne, after the death of Lord Swinton. He remained courageously loyal to his old allies, however: in January 1796 he voted in support of Henry Erskine in the ballot which deposed Erskine as dean of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh for having presided at a public meeting to oppose government policy. As a judge Bannatyne was generally regarded as impartial, sound, and clear, although a choleric William Adam in 1811 described him as one of a group of judges who were &#145;worse than Faggots in a Muster roll&#146;, from whose incapacity &#145;nothing is to be expected&#146;  (Adam, &#145;Memorandum&#146;). He retired from the court of session in 1823 and was knighted on 22 December 1823, becoming Sir William Macleod Bannatyne. He was father of the Scottish bar when he died in 1833.<br>
<br>Bannatyne's interests and friendships extended from the professional and the political to the literary and the philanthropic. He was associated with Henry Mackenzie, Robert Cullen, William Craig, and others in producing the Edinburgh periodicals <span class="italic">The Mirror</span> (1779) and its successor <span class="italic">The Lounger</span> (1785&#150;7), which arose out of an informal essay club and which were modelled on <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. Bannatyne himself wrote for five issues of <span class="italic">The Mirror</span> (nos. 6, 28, 46, 58, and 76) and two issues of <span class="italic">The Lounger</span> (nos. 13 and 39). The Bannatyne Club, of which he was a founder member, was established in 1823 for the purpose of publishing Scottish antiquarian papers. His colleague Sir Walter Scott edited an account of the life and manuscripts of the poetry collector George Bannatyne (1545&#150;1607/8) for volume 35 and included some of Sir William's own verses as an appendix, which Scott privately described as &#145;sad trash&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 10.495). Reflecting his practical interest in the economy and culture of highland Scotland, Bannatyne was a founder member of the Highland Society of Scotland in 1784. He also maintained a strong personal connection with the highlands through the Macleod family, for whose senior members, such as General Norman Macleod (1754&#150;1801), he sometimes acted as a trustee and legal adviser.<br>
<br>Bannatyne, clubbable, popular, and described by Cockburn as &#145;an honest merry old gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials &hellip; by Henry Cockburn</span>, 133), sacrificed the Kames estate to his enjoyment of Edinburgh culture and society, selling it about 1810 to James Hamilton, writer to the signet. He died on 30 November 1833 at his home, Whiteford House on the Canongate in Edinburgh.<br>
