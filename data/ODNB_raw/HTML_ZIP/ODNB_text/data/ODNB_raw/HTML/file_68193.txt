<span class="headword">Crompton, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1558&#150;1609), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was born in London, the second son of William Crompton (<i>d</i>. in or before 1577), a London mercer who had purchased lands in London, Staffordshire, and Kent, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Thomas Boughton, of Mardyke, in Essex. He may have attended school in Shrewsbury. The family's landed property was left to his elder brother, William, but Thomas received an annuity of &pound;20 which he used to pay his way through Oxford, where he entered St Alban Hall in 1577. Having graduated BA (1579) and MA (1582), his grace for the degree of DCL (1584) was refused on the grounds of &#145;suspected backwardness in religion&#146;. Five years later, admitting that he had earlier not been &#145;so well settled&#146; as he should have been, he was now willing to take the oath of supremacy and to conform to the established church, and was allowed to proceed both BCL and DCL. In the same year, 1589, he married Barbara Hudson of Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Crompton entered Doctors' Commons and over the next twenty years his name figures in a wide range of administrative and judicial records. James I on one occasion said that he was as good a man as Sir Edward Coke. Expert in maritime law, and proficient in languages, he served both Elizabeth and James as advocate for foreign causes in the admiralty court. He accompanied Cecil to France in 1598 and acted for him in cases involving piracy and shipping disputes. Crompton also specialized in ecclesiastical law, and was personally close to Richard Bancroft, bishop of London and later archbishop of Canterbury, to whom he left a small token in his will. He was advocate-general for ecclesiastical causes (1603); attended the Hampton Court conference as &#145;a doctor of the Arches&#146;  (Cardwell, 85); and served as chancellor of the diocese of London and vicar-general, with Sir Edward Stanhope, of the archbishop of Canterbury (1605&#150;9).<br>
<br>In the House of Commons, Crompton sat for Shaftesbury, Dorset (1589), by patronage of the earl of Pembroke; Boroughbridge, Yorkshire, through Cecil (1597); Whitchurch, Hampshire (1601), through episcopacy; and Oxford University (1604&#150;9). In the parliament of 1601 he opposed the bill against pluralities, and he met with a hostile reception when in 1604 he spoke in favour of commissaries' courts, narrowly avoiding censure after revealing that he had consulted with some of the bishops about the proposed legislation against them. In these matters as in others Crompton, like other civil lawyers, was a natural ally of the crown and the church against common lawyers and (in his view) anti-clerical reformers in the House of Commons. He criticized the common lawyers for their use of prohibitions which, he argued, conflicted with their oaths to maintain the liberties of the church: as he saw it, the ecclesiastical courts were being hindered from imposing effective church discipline. Similarly, Crompton prepared a wide-ranging defence of the crown's right to impositions  (BL, Cotton MS, Titus FIV, fols. 242&#150;3). In the controversy over the oath of allegiance he refuted papist claims that the pope had power to depose princes and their subjects the right to take up arms against them as infidels or heretics.<br>
<br>Crompton accumulated enough capital to invest in commerce and purchase lands and manors at Millwich and Cresswell in Staffordshire. He was granted arms in 1595 and was knighted in 1603. He left lands to his sons John, Richard, and Thomas after the death of his wife, 1000 marks for the marriage of his first daughter, 500 marks for the marriage of the second, and &pound;200 to his daughter Barbara. Crompton died in January or February 1609.<br>
