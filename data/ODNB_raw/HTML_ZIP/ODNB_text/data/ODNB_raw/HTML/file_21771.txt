<span class="headword">Peeris,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1520), <span class="occ">chronicler</span>, describes himself in the preamble to his only known work, a verse chronicle of the Percy family, as a clerk and priest who was secretary to Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland. He has been plausibly identified with the William Pyers who in the year 1519&#150;20 was paid 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. by Beverley corporation for coming from Wressle to alter the text of the town's Corpus Christi play; another 7<i>s</i>. were disbursed &#145;to make an agreement with him for transposing&#146; that play  (Goldberg, 154&#150;5). The earl of Northumberland was Beverley's patron, while Wressle, a few miles west of Hull, was one of his principal residences. Both there and at the earl's house at Leconfield there were walls and ceilings decorated with moralizing verses. The fact that Pyers is described in the Beverley records as a poet gives plausibility to suggestions that the same hand was responsible both for the verses and for Peeris's chronicle.<br>
<br>Described by Peeris as a new year's gift for the earl, the chronicle refers to the latter's daughter Margaret as married to Henry Clifford, the son and heir of the tenth Lord Clifford, and must therefore have been composed between Henry's marriage in 1513 and his father's death in 1523. It survives in a number of copies. Probably the earliest is Alnwick Castle, MS 79. Not only is this a roll whose ornamental margins (embellished with medallion busts of all the English kings between William I and a youthful and clean-shaven Henry VIII) suggest that it was prepared for presentation to its dedicatee, but it also differs from other versions in both its beginning and its conclusion. Of those later versions, British Library, Royal MS 18 D.ii, folios 186&#150;95, forms part of a volume which belonged to the fifth earl, whose arms are illuminated on folio 162. Copies also survive in Alnwick Castle, MSS 521 (inexplicably ascribed to William Gamble) and 522, in Yale University, Osborn collection, MS fa. 19, folios 41<i>v</i>&#150;51<i>v</i>, and in Bodleian Library, MS Dodsworth 50, folios 119&#150;128<i>v</i>. The last, which suffers from a lacuna of nineteen stanzas, was published at Newcastle in 1847 in an edition by John Besley, vicar of Long Benton in Northumberland.<br>
<br>Peeris's chronicle is largely composed in seven-line rhyme royal stanzas, occasionally expanded to nine or eleven lines. In this it probably shows the influence of the fifteenth-century Northumbrian chronicler John Hardyng (a copy of whose chronicle was in the possession of the fifth earl, now Bodl. Oxf., MS Selden B. 10). Except in its earliest version, which postulates exploits &#145;in the lande of Perse&#146; as the source of the family's name, Peeris's chronicle traces the fortunes of the Percys from the early tenth century down to the murder of the fourth earl in 1489. Peeris refers to a variety of written sources&#151;deeds, charters, and tombstone inscriptions&#151;as well as chronicles, but his purpose is not so much strictly historical as to celebrate the greatness of the Percy family and urge the fifth earl to maintain it. He takes a particular interest in religious foundations and donations, but is also careful to note royal and aristocratic associations. The sententious conclusion to the first version of the chronicle, urging the earl to &#145;liberalite&#146; as the mean between &#145;prodegalite&#146; and &#145;covetise&#146;, and advising him to &#145;Remember your progeny your excellent riall kyn&#146;, may have been excised from later copies as indiscreet, after debt and family discord brought disaster upon the Percys in the 1530s.<br>
