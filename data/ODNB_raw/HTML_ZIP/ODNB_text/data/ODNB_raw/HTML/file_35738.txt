<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richardson <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Robertson]</span>,  Ethel Florence Lindesay</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Henry Handel Richardson]</span>  (1870&#150;1946), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 3 January 1870 at 1 Blanche Terrace, Fitzroy, Melbourne, Australia. She was the elder daughter of Walter Lindesay Richardson (1825&#150;1879) and Mary Bailey (1835&#150;1896). Her father came from a Dublin protestant family, trained as a doctor in Edinburgh, and went out to the Australian goldfields in Victoria in 1852. Gold-digging and being a squatters' storekeeper proved unsatisfactory, and by 1856 he had established a medical practice in Ballarat. Mary Richardson, an energetic and resourceful woman, had emigrated to Australia from Leicester as a teenager; she and Walter Richardson were married in Ballarat in 1855. Although the future novelist was not born until her parents had been married for fourteen years, their married life, and particularly the career and later devastating illness and death of her father when she was nine years old, provided the material for perhaps her greatest novel, and certainly the one by which she is best known, <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Richard Mahony</span>. This novel was originally published as a trilogy: <span class="italic">Australia felix</span> (1917), <span class="italic">The Way Home</span> (1925), and <span class="italic">Ultima Thule</span> (1929).<br>
<br>As a child Ethel Richardson lived in several small towns, where her mother worked as a postmistress. When she was thirteen she was sent to the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Melbourne. She proved to be a good scholar and an exceptional musician; consequently, in 1888 her mother was persuaded to take her and her younger sister, Lilian, to Europe, so that she could continue her musical studies. Except for a very brief visit in 1912 to check details for <span class="italic">Richard Mahony</span>, she never saw Australia again.<br>
<br>In 1889 Richardson entered the Leipzig conservatory, where she studied for three years, with the intention of becoming a concert pianist. However, her engagement to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61619/', "John George Robertson (1867&#150;1933)")</script>, a brilliant Scottish student of European languages, and her own distaste for public performances brought her studies to an end in 1892. Under Robertson's guidance she read widely in European literature and translated two novels (published under her married name): <span class="italic">Siren Voices: Niels Lyhne</span>, after <span class="italic">Niels Lyhne</span>, by the Danish writer J. P. Jacobsen; and <span class="italic">The Fisher Lass</span>, after <span class="italic">Fiskerjenten</span>, by the Norwegian Bjornstjerne Bjornsen.<br>
<br>Richardson and J. G. Robertson were married in Dublin on 30 December 1895. The early years of their marriage were spent in Strasbourg. Richardson's husband was appointed to a university lectureship and she began, rather hesitantly, to write a novel. They walked, read, listened to endless concerts, and enjoyed European intellectual life. This satisfying pattern came to an end in 1904 when J. G. Robertson, who had published <span class="italic">A History of German Literature</span> in 1902, was invited to become the first professor of German at London University. For Richardson, England and London proved much less congenial than Germany and Strasbourg. She turned inwards, concentrated on writing, and for the rest of her life restricted her company to her husband and a few close friends.<br>
<br>Her first novel, <span class="italic">Maurice Guest</span> (1908), for which she adopted the pseudonym Henry Handel Richardson, is set among music students in Leipzig. Nobody questioned that she was a male writer, and she was thereafter widely known as HHR or even Henry. Her second novel, <span class="italic">The Getting of Wisdom</span> (1910; filmed by Bruce Beresford in 1977), is based on her schooldays in Melbourne. She began work on <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Richard Mahony</span> in 1912, but the First World War delayed publication of the first volume; she eventually achieved fame with the publication of the final volume in 1929. In that year she was awarded the Australian Literary Society's gold medal for <span class="italic">Ultima Thule</span>, and in 1932 was nominated for the Nobel prize for literature.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1933 Richardson struggled to continue writing, but her collection of short stories and the late novel <span class="italic">The Young Cosima</span> (1939) did not match her earlier work. She had moved to a house at Fairlight, near Hastings, in 1934, and here, during the Second World War, she worked on an autobiographical memoir. It was unfinished at the time of her death and published as <span class="italic">Myself when Young</span> in 1948. She died, childless, of cancer of the colon on 20 March 1946, and was cremated at the Golders Green crematorium on 25 March.<br>
<br>Richardson was Australian by birth and British by residence (for the last forty-two years of her life), but her great achievement is to have written two major novels which are rooted in continental European realism. They owe little to English traditions. She was influenced by German philosophy and by Russian, Scandinavian, and French fiction, most notably in <span class="italic">Maurice Guest</span>, a novel which is remarkable for its unblinking treatment of sexual obsession and for its depiction of male homosexuality which is neither effete nor coy. The same sympathetic but intransigent realism is applied to her examination of her restless and obsessive hero in <span class="italic">The Fortunes of Richard Mahony</span>. Even the short novel <span class="italic">The Getting of Wisdom</span> avoids adolescent whimsy; it is witty and caustic about a difficult child.<br>
<br>As a writer Richardson was not linguistically inventive and she lacked the modernist sensibility of many of her contemporaries. But her respect for her characters, her brilliant evocation of their social environments (including her lengthy study of colonial Australia), and her unwavering depiction of the conflict between the hard facts of circumstance and the human yearning for freedom turned her, despite her limitations, into a major novelist.<br>
<br>Richardson was a pale, dark-haired, slightly built woman, who combined energetic enthusiasm for music, tennis, swimming, and walking with a lifelong tendency to withdraw into ill health. Her own view of herself was of a square peg failing to fit into a round hole, but this was a failure that she explored without self-pity. The effect on other people could be daunting, especially since she combined her objectivity with personal shyness. The transition from Germany to England was particularly difficult, since she had no small talk, and ditherers or chatterers would find themselves facing scrutinizing intelligent eyes and silence. However, given the opportunity to explore the unorthodox, she flourished. She had a lifelong sceptic's interest in spiritualism; she loved fast cars; and, as a researching novelist, she enjoyed investigating boxing booths and opium dens.<br>
