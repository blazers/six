<span class="headword">Hague,  Bernard</span>  (1893&#150;1960), <span class="occ">electrical engineer</span>, was born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 7 July 1893, the son of Joseph Hague, a theatrical manager, and his wife, Amy Florence Kitching. He was educated at Eccles grammar school and Rochdale central higher-grade school, and from 1908 until 1910 worked as an apprentice turner and fitter to Carter Brothers, millwrights in Rochdale. In 1911 he became a junior electrical designer with Ferranti, Hollinwood, studying part-time at Rochdale Technical College. He gained an exhibition at the City and Guilds College in London, matriculating in 1912 and entering the second year of the course. Hague gained the degree of BSc in electrical engineering with first-class honours in 1915, and went on to obtain the diploma of Imperial College (1916), the degrees of MSc (1919) and DSc (1927), and fellowship. He worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment as a lecturer until 1919, when he returned to the college as a lecturer. His talents were recognized by George Howe, professor of electrical engineering at the University of Glasgow, and Hague was invited to become a lecturer in the department in 1923. His PhD thesis, &#145;Testing of instrument transformers&#146;, was accepted three years later, and he quickly acquired a reputation as a superb lecturer and a precise and methodical scholar.<br>
<br>In 1929 Hague went as a visiting lecturer to the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, returning to Glasgow the following year to become a senior lecturer. In 1946 he was appointed to the James Watt chair of electrical engineering in succession to his mentor, Howe. He became dean of the faculty of engineering, and served for fifteen years as the president of the Student International Club. Hague was also a member of the council of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, serving as a member of council from 1950 until 1953, and was a founder and director of the Scottish Electrical Training Scheme.<br>
<br>Beyond the confines of his own department and profession Hague made a great impression on the cultural life of the university. An accomplished oboist, he was a mainstay of the university orchestral society, and played in the orchestra. He was a member of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music. His hobbies included working in wood and metal at his home in Hyndland in Glasgow. Latterly he collected and restored musical instruments.<br>
<br>Hague published prolifically in technical journals. His most influential book was <span class="italic">Electromagnetic Problems in Electrical Engineering</span>, published in 1929 and reprinted after the Second World War as <span class="italic">The Principles of Electromagnetism Applied to Electrical Machines</span>. Another well-known textbook, <span class="italic">Alternating Current Bridge Methods</span>, was first published in 1923 and translated into many languages. He continued to revise the text until his death, and a sixth edition, revised by his colleague, Thomas R. Foord, was published in 1971.<br>
<br>Hague married Muriel Thorne Grose, and they had a daughter, Sheila Thorne Hague. Muriel died in January 1960, and he never fully recovered from the sadness of her loss. He died on 29 September 1960 at Glasgow's Western Infirmary. The University of Glasgow's principal, Sir Hector Hetherington, remembered Hague for<blockquote>his expressive face, crowned by the oriflame of his snow white hair, his dress, his handwriting, his craftsman's skill, his love of music and his mastery of his own beloved instrument. He was quiet, even reticent, though easy in conversation, uncontroversial, though firm and clear in judgement, helpful to others, especially to students from overseas, and altogether loyal. (Hetherington, 59)</blockquote>
