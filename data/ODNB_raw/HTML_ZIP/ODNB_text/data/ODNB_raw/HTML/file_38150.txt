<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Woodforde,  James</span>  (1740&#150;1803), <span class="occ">diarist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 16 June 1740 at the parsonage, Ansford, Somerset, the sixth child in the family of four sons (one of whom died in childhood) and three daughters of the Revd Samuel Woodforde (1695&#150;1771), rector of Ansford and vicar of the neighbouring parish of Castle Cary, and his wife, Jane Collins (<i>bap</i>. 1706, <i>d</i>. 1766). She belonged to a family domiciled in that part of Somerset for at least two centuries. The Woodfordes, on the other hand, came originally from Northamptonshire, making the transition from small, open-field farmers to professional men in the seventeenth century; their association with the Anglican church was already three generations old when James was born.<br>
<br>After attending two preparatory schools Woodforde was admitted as a scholar on the foundation of Winchester College in 1752. In his final year, 1758, he was seventh on the roll &#145;ad Oxon&#146; which regulated the transfer to the sister foundation of New College, Oxford. As his place there was not assured, he was provisionally enrolled at another college, Oriel, and his father apparently helped out with a little judicious bribery. On 21 July 1759 he was able to celebrate by writing the first line of a diary: &#145;Made a Scholar of New-College.&#146; In 1763 he was ordained and graduated BA, proceeding MA in 1767, and BD in 1775.<br>
<br>For ten years after graduation Woodforde worked as a curate in Somerset, most of that time assisting his father. He never married but in his thirties was sufficiently attracted by Elizabeth, or Betsy, White, a relative through marriage, to make her a cautiously guarded proposal. When he returned to university in 1773 it was with the intention of claiming the first suitable benefice in the gift of New College to become vacant. But Betsy did not wait for this, and married a man far richer than himself. Woodforde's reaction reveals less sorrow or grief than a sort of irritated pique. &#145;She has behaved to me like a mere Jilt&#146;, he told his diary. Meanwhile he became sub-warden of his college, and a pro-proctor. Late in 1774 he was presented to the living of Weston Longville, Norfolk, a well-endowed preferment worth some &pound;400 a year. In April 1776 he resigned his fellowship and went to live there, residing in the parish for the rest of his life, a quiet existence interrupted only by journeys to see his relatives in the west, on average once every three years. He was a gregarious, hospitable man, and kind-hearted, although his charities represented only an inconsiderable fraction of his income, largely derived from tithe. He seems not to have possessed a markedly religious temperament, and most of his concerns were those he could share with lay people, although his closest friends were fellow clerics.<br>
<br>Woodforde was a very ordinary man. He read little, and his exclusively classical education left only the faintest impression on his mind. His one outstanding characteristic is that he wrote his diary, the work of a lifetime. After the first few weeks he settled down to making an entry each day, and kept this up for forty-three years. The diary was unknown until selections were published by Oxford University Press under the title <span class="italic">The Diary of a Country Parson</span> (5 vols., 1924&#150;31). In this edition Woodforde was made into a semi-comic figure, acquiring a reputation he has never quite lost. Food and drink were given so much editorial prominence that an unwary reader might well be left with the impression that Woodforde produced little more than a chronicle of gluttony. Later work on the diary has shown that its great virtue lies in its value as primary source material for the social and domestic history of its era and, for the general reader, in the incomparably vivid picture of country life and manners. Woodforde's manner of writing&#151;one hesitates to call it a style&#151;is the opposite of the antithetical, heavily Latinized literary prose of its time. It is very plain, simple, and lucid, having more in common with the speech rhythms of its day than with the elaboration of fine writing.<br>
<br>Although Woodforde has much to say about trivial indispositions, he was a healthy man until well past fifty. In 1797 he was afflicted by a more serious disease, possibly a stroke, from the effects of which he never recovered, although he continued to write his diary every day. It ends with an incomplete entry for 17 October 1802, appropriately noting: &#145;Dinner to day rost Beef&#146;  (Winstanley). He died at the parsonage on 1 January 1803 and was buried on 5 January inside Weston Longville church, beneath the chancel.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_68344"></a><span class="headword">Anna Maria <span class="st"> [Nancy]</span> Woodforde</span>  (1757&#150;1830) was born on 8 March 1757 at Alhampton, Ditcheat, Somerset, the eldest child of the diarist's elder brother, Heighes Woodforde (1726&#150;1789), and his wife, Anne Dorville (1734&#150;1799). From 1780 she lived with her uncle and kept house for him. In general they got along very well together. He appreciated her gift for laughter, and even the tones of her voice must have sounded refreshingly different from the Norfolk accent. In the earlier years of her stay her letters home were lyrical about the kindness and generosity of her uncle, and his rescue of her from a poverty-stricken life. But years passed; the suitor she must have dreamed of never appeared, and she drifted into middle age; the relationship soured and her uncle took to calling her &#145;Miss Woodforde&#146; in the diary. She also was a <span class="occ">diarist</span>. In 1792 she acquired a large manuscript volume, and in that year produced a full diary, to demand comparison with that of her uncle. She lived on until her death on 6 January 1830 at her home in High Street, Castle Cary, and was buried on 13 January at Ansford.<br>
