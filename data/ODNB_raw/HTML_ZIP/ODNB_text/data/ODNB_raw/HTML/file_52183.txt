<span class="headword">Holland,  Ralph</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1452), <span class="occ">tailor and alderman of London</span>, was possibly from Newington, Surrey, where he owned property. He had married a woman called Matilda by 1419, when he was already a successful cloth merchant. He owned shops in various parishes in London, and supplied cloth to, among others, Thomas of Lancaster, duke of Clarence (<i>d</i>. 1421). Like other ambitious London tailors involved in the cloth trade he was frequently described as a &#145;draper&#146; and even became a member of the Drapers' Company. Despite this his loyalties clearly lay with the Tailors' Company, of which he became a liveryman in 1415&#150;16 before being chosen master in 1419. He enrolled at least eleven apprentices during his career and made substantial contributions to the funds of the tailors' fraternity, dedicated to St John the Baptist, at a time when it was seeking to enhance its prestige in the City. His political career was controversial from the outset: in October 1426 he spoke out against the mayor who, drawing upon a royal writ of 1315, attempted to restrict participation in the mayoral and shrieval elections to those personally summoned by the mayor and aldermen. Holland declared the ordinance a fabrication, threatened several prominent citizens, and was sent to Ludgate prison. By 1429 he was a common councilman and was elected sheriff by the commonalty the same year, but failed in his first attempt to be elected an alderman. By 1434, when he was appointed one of the auditors of the accounts of London Bridge, he was probably the wealthiest member of his guild: he acquired two substantial houses, Basset's Inn and Pembridge's Inn, as well as other properties in London and Surrey which, in 1436, were assessed as being worth &pound;24 per annum.<br>
<br>In 1435 Holland made the first of several loans to the crown and by October that year had finally been elected an alderman, for Bread Street ward. He subsequently served on several important civil committees. His election coincided with the intensification of the rivalry which existed between the tailors and the drapers, particularly over the right to search shops and stalls for defective cloth, a function normally delegated to guild officials by the mayor. In 1439, following an earlier statute, the tailors acquired a controversial new grant by letter patent, probably with the assistance of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1447), with whom Holland and the tailors had established a strong connection. It was claimed by the drapers that this charter infringed the city's liberties concerning the &#145;search&#146;, and relations were further strained when the tailors claimed the right to scrutinize cloth sold at St Bartholomew's fair at Smithfield. In October 1439 Holland made the first of three bids for the mayoralty, knowing that success would greatly assist the ambitions of the predominantly artisan tailors, now in direct competition with the drapers. Holland was rejected on each occasion, but by 1441 his candidacy had become identified with the interests of a wider constituency of artisans in the capital, concerned at the gradual encroachment upon their rights as freemen by an overwhelmingly mercantile court of aldermen. At the election that October a large crowd of tailors, skinners, and other &#145;handycraftymen&#146; greeted the election of Robert Clopton, a draper, with cries of &#145;nay, not that man but Raulyn Holland!&#146;  (Kingsford, 154&#150;5), and in the ensuing disturbances six tailors and five skinners were arrested and sent to prison.<br>
<br>Over the next three years Holland continued to criticize the ruling oligarchy and leading citizens such as John Paddesley, a former mayor unpopular with the tailors, whom he accused of spending 1000 marks of the city's money on his private concerns. When a peace commission for London was established in 1443 Holland was at the forefront of the opposition to it, using the forum of the court of aldermen to declare it to be a commission &#145;not of peace but of war&#146;  (CLRO, Journal 4, fol. 4<i>v</i>), which would act against the interests of the city's artisans. The dissension came to a head at the election of the chamberlain in September, and a show of force was planned for the mayoral election on 13 October. Holland now rarely attended the court of aldermen and his house was used by the leaders of the artisans for conspiratorial meetings. The subsequent failure of the artisan movement resulted in Holland's own removal from the court of aldermen on 18 May 1444, after the aldermen had heard a lengthy account of his activities as an instigator of the unrest, and the accusations he had levelled at fellow aldermen over the years.<br>
<br>Holland took no further part in city politics and died before 23 October 1452, when the first of his wills was proved. His wife had died before March that year. In June he had received two tenements in Watling Street from the crown in recognition of his services to the present king and Henry V. Holland remembered his craft in his wills, leaving Basset's Inn, Pembridge's Inn, and other properties in London to the Tailors' guild. As well as funding his obit the income was to be used by the master and wardens to increase the amount paid to the almsmen and women of the guild by 1<i>d</i>. per week. He asked to be buried alongside his wife in the church of St Mary Aldermary. In 1454 the executors of that &#145;worshipful and notable man Raulyn Holand&#146;  (Anstey, 1.327) received a letter from Oxford University asking for a bequest for the new divinity schools. His son, also named Ralph, was likewise a tailor and appears to have predeceased him.<br>
