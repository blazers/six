<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Hugh</span>  (1699&#150;1773), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the highland district</span>, son of Alexander Macdonald (<i>fl</i>. 1698&#150;1726) of Morar and his second wife, Mary Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart, was born at Morar on 2 February 1699. In 1714 he entered the highland seminary at Loch Morar, then in 1716 went to Scalan seminary, where he was ordained priest on 18 September 1725. He served at Morar until 1730. On 12 February 1731 he was nominated titular bishop of Diana and vicar apostolic of the newly formed highland district. Having lived at the Scots College, Paris, from July 1730 to September 1731 preparing for his future duties, he received episcopal ordination at Edinburgh on 18 October 1731. His headquarters remained at Morar.<br>
<br>At this time the Jansenist controversy divided the highland clergy deeply but eventually it died away. After Prince Charles Edward arrived in Scotland in July 1745 Bishop Macdonald, having failed to persuade him to return to France, blessed the prince's standard raised at Glenfinnan on 19 August 1745. Macdonald remained hidden in Morar after the defeat at Culloden, until in September 1746 he sailed for France, where he was given a pension for life by the French crown. Although he returned to Scotland in August 1749, he remained mostly outside his district. In July 1755 he was arrested at Edinburgh, and sentenced to perpetual banishment in March 1756, but the sentence was not enforced and he lived quietly in the north of Scotland, mainly in upper Banffshire, outside the highland district, then at Aberchalder, a few miles west of Fort Augustus. In 1758 he visited Paris.<br>
<br>In 1761 Macdonald ordained his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17439/', "John Macdonald (1727&#150;1779)")</script>, as his coadjutor bishop and successor. He died at Aberchalder on 12 March 1773, one of only two men who had played a leading part at Glenfinnan to die peacefully in Scotland, and was buried in Kilfinnan cemetery on Loch Lochy side. Macdonald priests of a certain social rank, including several bishops, were to form a sort of caste and have great influence in the Roman Catholic church in the highlands for the next two centuries.<br>
