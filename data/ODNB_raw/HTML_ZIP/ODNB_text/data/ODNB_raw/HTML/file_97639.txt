<span class="headword">Bedser, Sir  Alec Victor</span>  (1918&#150;2010), <span class="occ">cricketer and businessman</span>, was born on 4 July 1918 at his grandmother's house, 13 Pangbourne Street, Reading, one of twin sons of Arthur Bedser (1890&#150;1978), a bricklayer then serving as an aircraftsman with the RAF, and his wife, Florence Beatrice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Badcock (1893&#150;1989). He and his brother <a name="cosubject_97639"></a><span class="headword">Eric Arthur Bedser</span>  (1918&#150;2006), the elder of the two by ten minutes, from whom he was inseparable, were brought up first in two rooms in an aunt's house on Horsell Common, then at Knaphill, Surrey. Later they helped their father build a house in Woking and resided there together until Eric's death.<br>
<br>A love of physical exertion grew apparent as Alec and Eric Bedser began walking the mile each way to Maybury junior school. Even when they were not in class together at Monument Hill central school, Woking, they would make the same errors. &#145;Our absolute and complete affinity is hard to explain,&#146; Alec would reflect. &#145;But it is true and very real to us&#151;so much so that as long as I can remember we have never been happy apart&#146;  (Hill, 82). They shared a bank account; neither would marry. At fourteen they went to work as clerks in the same solicitor's office in Lincoln's Inn Fields, but the lure of the law did not last. Encouraged by Alan Peach, a former Surrey all-rounder who had opened a cricket school in Woking and would recommend them to the Oval, both bowled medium-fast (just as both had played full-back at football) until they decided it made no sense to duplicate each other so precisely. A coin was tossed, Alec won, and Eric switched to off-spin. Off the field, the only sure way to distinguish them was to spot the scar under the elder twin's chin, acquired while batting. The confusion was increased by the fact that they frequently wore matching outfits.<br>
<br>Signed by Surrey in 1937, Alec and Eric Bedser made their first-class d&eacute;but in the same match, against Oxford University two years later (Eric taking one wicket and Alec none). They joined the RAF at the outbreak of the Second World War. Sent to France with the British expeditionary force, they had a narrow escape when attacked by a German bomber on the Belgian border. Subsequently stranded in France, they were rescued by a Surrey member who drove them most of the way to Dunkirk. They subsequently served (together) in north Africa, Greece, Italy, and Austria.<br>
<br>When play resumed after the war, pranks became a Bedser stock-in-trade. Eric gave speeches in Alec's stead. On one fabled occasion, they even shared an over, to the bewilderment of the renowned Kent and England left-hander Frank Woolley. &#145;Surrey v. England at The Oval in forty-seven&#146;, chuckled Alec, recollecting their coup of deception. &#145;Forty-six&#146;, corrected Eric:<blockquote>Monty [General Montgomery] was there, 18,000 in the ground. Alec bowled three balls then swapped with me at mid-on. I bowled spin but we had similar actions. Woolley didn't realise we were twins. At the end of the over he turned to the keeper and said, &#145;He's got a wonderful change of pace&#146;. (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 5 Jan 1997)</blockquote>Eric Bedser went on to become a dependable all-rounder, and a stalwart of the highly successful Surrey team of the 1950s. Alec Bedser, by contrast, was primarily a bowler, but one of the most successful in cricket history. He, discerned that most poetic of cricket writers, Alan Ross, was a bowler &#145;by metier, as some are locksmiths or boot-makers or violinists&#146;  (Liverman and Liverman, &#145;A profile&#146;). Blessed with massive shoulders and enormous hands, he generated bat-jarring pace from a brief, heavy-footed approach. What hoisted him above his peers was a relentless command of line and length enlivened by sharp inswing and a leg-cutter fiendish enough, at Adelaide in 1947, to confound and bowl Don Bradman for a duck: the Australian, widely regarded as the greatest batsman of the twentieth century, acclaimed it the finest ball he ever faced.<br>
<br>Picked for England's first post-war test in June 1946 after taking 6&#150;14 against a strong MCC eleven followed by half a dozen scalps playing against the Indian tourists, Alec Bedser immediately made himself virtually undroppable, ejecting seven batsmen in the first innings and four in the second, then another eleven in the next test. By the autumn he was taking his first steps on Australian soil, where the tumultuous greeting for the ultimately outclassed MCC tourists kick-started a love affair that would endure for the rest of his days. &#145;When we docked in Fremantle the quayside was packed&#146;, he later recalled. &#145;It was like that everywhere. The teams got on famously. While we were all travelling on the train from Brisbane to Sydney, Bradman came down the corridor to give us a crate of beer&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, 5 Jan 1997). The series, though, began in anger. In the opening test in Brisbane, Bradman had made 28 of his eventual match-winning 187 when Jack Ikin claimed a catch at slip; at the end of the over Walter Hammond, the England captain, cursed his opposite number. In hindsight, felt Bedser, cricket reaped the benefits:<blockquote>The fact that Bradman came over [to England] in 1948 gave the game here the lift it needed. That's why him not being given out in Brisbane was the best thing that could have happened. Not that we made a fuss. I know what Hammond supposedly said, but I never heard it. When you'd had six and a half years' service in France and North Africa, it didn't seem that important. We were just grateful to be there. (ibid.)</blockquote>Bradman, indeed, became a firm friend as well as a regular foe on the field. No other bowler ever took his wicket five matches running, albeit he averaged 91.38 in the thirteen test innings in which he and Bedser faced each other.<br>
<br>Bedser's second Ashes tour saw his stature soar: in a series in which England lost the first four tests before inflicting their first defeat of Australia since 1938, he was essentially a one-man attack, claiming thirty wickets at 16.06 apiece. Two years later, he collected thirty-nine&#151;three times as many as the next most effective contributor&#151;to help his country reclaim the Ashes for the first time since 1933. At Trent Bridge, Lindsey Hassett had made a flawless, untroubled 115 when he fell to a ball that swung in, pitched leg, and clipped off-stump, drawing three equally futile strokes. At Headingley, Bedser overhauled the record held by the Australian spinner Clarrie Grimmett, taking his 217th test wicket; not for ten years would Brian Statham surpass his eventual tally of 236. The burden he bore so uncomplainingly made these feats all the more imperishable: in those two series he bowled the equivalent of 525.1 six-ball overs; the next most by an Englishman was Trevor Bailey's 244.2.<br>
<br>By the time of the Ashes tour of 1954&#150;5 Alec Bedser was thirty-six and, after a chastening first test in Brisbane, when he took one for 131, he contracted shingles only to discover his omission from the next encounter via a team-sheet pinned to a door. He deserved immeasurably better from Len Hutton, the driven but taciturn captain he had served so tirelessly, the leader whose reputation he had made, who said not a word. Thereafter, he watched from the wings as Frank Tyson and Brian Statham, the next, pacier generation, powered England to a resounding triumph. Playing one more test the next summer, he never forgave Hutton's apparent ingratitude.<br>
<br>Meanwhile both Alec and Eric Bedser were fixtures of the remarkable Surrey team who under the captaincy of Stuart Surridge, and with Jim Laker and Tony Lock as team-mates, took the county championship title seven times in succession between 1952 and 1958, and in 1956 became the first English county for forty-three years to beat an Australian touring side. In all first-class cricket Alec Bedser took 1,924 wickets at an average of 20.41 and scored 5,735 runs at an average of 14.51. Eric Bedser took 833 wickets at an average of 24.95 and scored 14,716 runs at an average of 24.00. Alec retired in 1960, and Eric in 1962.<br>
<br>In 1954 the twins, with their friend Jack Fagan, set up a shop selling office equipment in Woking. After opening another outlet in Staines, and acquiring Henry Baker Ltd, in St Bride Street, London, in 1962 they formed a partnership with Ronald Straker as Straker-Bedser, which by the time it was taken over by the Ryman chain in 1977 had 25 shops with 180 employees and an annual turnover of &pound;1.8 million. The twins then became consultants for Brengreen Holdings, a contract cleaning company run by their friend and fellow cricketer David Evans (later a Conservative MP, known for his outspokenness and self-confessed racism).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Alec Bedser remained an influential figure in English cricket. In 1962&#150;3 he was assistant to the duke of Norfolk as manager of the MCC side on tour to Australia; he later managed the MCC tour of 1974&#150;5 and the England tour of 1979&#150;80. He also served as a national selector from 1962 to 1985, chairing the panel from 1968 to 1981, commanding respect but increasingly at odds with global professionalism and the one-day game amid a humbling period for English cricket&#151;one reflected in, and exacerbated by, impatient selection. To his credit was the left-field but highly successful summons for David Steele against Australia in 1975; more rigid, and typical, was the suspension in 1969 of Tom Graveney for participating in a charity game on the rest day of a test. Bedser was also involved in the initial decision to leave Basil D'Oliveira out of the England team due to tour South Africa in 1968, for fear of antagonizing the apartheid government.<br>
<br>The Bedsers usually wintered in Australia, renewing a close friendship with Bradman; Alec made his final trip there alone for the Ashes series of 2006&#150;7, coping better than anticipated, it seemed, with his brother's death on 24 May 2006. Never happier, apparently, than when chiding his successors for what he saw as an aversion to hard work, Alec Bedser came to be regarded as a kindly if inflexible symbol of the old order, an image hardened by his membership of the right-wing Freedom Association, which favoured maintaining sporting ties with apartheid South Africa and was in part funded by the South African government. Appointed OBE in 1964 and CBE in 1982, he was knighted for his services to the game in 1997 during the premiership of John Major, a Surrey member and perennial supporter. He liked to say that he was the first England bowler to have been knighted since Sir Francis Drake. At the time of his death of heart failure at the Nuffield Hospital, Woking, on 4 April 2010 he was England's oldest test cricketer, extolled as the last of the great medium-pacers and, as the packed memorial service in Southwark Cathedral on 12 July 2010 confirmed, the final heroic link to a misty, distant past.<br>
