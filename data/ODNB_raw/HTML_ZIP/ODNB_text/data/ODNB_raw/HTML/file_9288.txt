<span class="headword">Fenner, Sir  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1612), <span class="occ">judge</span>, the son of John Fenner of Crawley, and Elinor Goring, was descended from a well-established Sussex family. After a period at New Inn, he entered the Middle Temple in 1557 and was called to the bar. In 1576 he was made bencher of his inn. He was autumn reader in the same year and in 1577 he was created serjeant-at-law. Alongside his legal career he represented Lewes in the parliament of 1571, and as member for New Shoreham he played an active part in that of 1572. In 1590 he was made a judge of the court of king's bench, and played his part in several state trials, including those of the earl of Essex and the earl of Southampton. He is known to have married and had children. He was knighted in 1603. Age began to take its toll in the early years of the seventeenth century, and in 1608 he was pensioned off from his judicial office. He died on 23 January 1612 at Hayes, Middlesex, the place where he had made his home after moving from Sussex in the mid-1590s, and was buried the following day in the parish church.<br>
<br>Fenner was a capable lawyer, though he was overshadowed by the forceful personalities of his judicial colleagues. He is principally remembered as the defendant in <i>Lord Buckhurst's case</i> (1598), the first case in Sir Edward Coke's <span class="italic">Reports</span>, and as the object of Robert Cecil's barbed remark, &#145;Justice Fenner will never run mad with learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 285). Yet his reputation was defended by Coke himself; and the legal diarist John Manningham records some earthy <i>bons mots</i> which point to a genuine quickness of wit. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he does not seem systematically to have reported cases, though a few notes attributed to him do survive in manuscript.<br>
