<span class="headword">Dudley,  Elizabeth</span>  (1779&#150;1849), <span class="occ">Quaker minister</span>, was born on 1 September 1779 at Suirville Mills, Clonmel, co. Tipperary, Ireland, the eldest of the eight children of Robert Dudley (1732?&#150;1807) and his third wife, Mary (1750&#150;1823), daughter of Joseph and Mary Stokes of Bristol. She was educated at Suir Island School, Clonmel. In 1798 her mother reluctantly accepted medical advice stipulating &#145;a sea voyage and short residence at Bristol Hot-wells&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Mary Dudley</span>, 228) and was accompanied by Elizabeth, her three sisters, and her brother Charles: they remained there until early 1800. Her mother's gift in the vocal ministry had been acknowledged by her Quaker meeting shortly before Elizabeth's birth and in 1802 she accompanied her mother on a religious visit to England.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1807, Mary Dudley moved to London in 1810 with her three surviving daughters. In the following year Southwark monthly meeting acknowledged Elizabeth's gift in the ministry, which &#145;though full of gospel love and human sympathies &hellip; was less tender and winning&#146; than that of her mother, for she &#145;was endowed with a more masculine understanding&#146; and &#145;possessed in a large degree the power of close reasoning, with a clearness of judgment which was seldom at fault&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 328).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Dudley's travels in the ministry were, except for one visit to Ireland in 1845, confined to Britain. She held meetings in many places where there were no Quakers and was broad in her religious sympathies; the evangelical Joseph John Gurney (1788&#150;1847) and Josiah Forster (1782&#150;1870) were frequent correspondents. Nevertheless, when faced with more extreme evangelical views, she could write (probably in 1836): &#145;Mary J. Graham is too strong in her views of election and assurance for my Quakerly expansiveness, and seems to overlook numerous Scripture assertions bearing on universal grace and love&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Elizabeth Dudley</span>, 237). Perhaps her firmest friendship, lasting from 1802 until her death, was with Lucy Alexander (1774&#150;1856), the wife of Thomas Maw of Needham Market from 1804.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Dudley was a not infrequent visitor to Newgate and by 1818 had recorded her conviction that the death penalty was inconsistent with Christian principles and must be abolished. She was clerk to the women's yearly meeting of British Quakers in 1817 and from 1826 to 1834. She was an active member of the morning meeting (the body which acted as a publications committee for British Friends) and she herself prepared the <span class="italic">Life</span> (1825) of her mother. Her sister Charlotte (1786&#150;1825) was also acknowledged a minister in 1825, shortly before she died.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Dudley was deeply affected by her sister Mary's death in 1847. In August 1849, on returning from a visit to Lucy and Thomas Maw, she found cholera raging with great violence in Southwark. On 6 September she became unwell, signs of cholera appeared, and she died shortly after midnight at The Priory, Peckham. Her body was interred in the Quaker burial-ground, Peckham, on 10 September.<br>
