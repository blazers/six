<span class="headword">Hillyard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bingley]</span>,  Blanche</span>  (1863&#150;1946), <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, was born on 3 November 1863 at Stanhope Lodge, Greenford, Middlesex, the daughter of Charles Bentley Bingley, &#145;gentleman&#146;, formerly proprietor of a tailoring business in Great Marlborough Street, London, and his wife, Elizabeth Harrison. In Greenford, on 13 July 1887, she married Commander George Whiteside Hillyard RN (1864&#150;1943), with whom she had a son, Jack, and a daughter, Marjorie.<br>
<br>Blanche Hillyard's remarkable career in competitive tennis spanned three decades. In 1884, aged twenty, as Blanche Bingley, she burst upon the tennis scene when she was among the field of thirteen in the first ladies' singles championship at Wimbledon. After winning two matches, she lost to the eventual champion, Maud Watson, in the semi-final. In 1912, aged forty-eight, after twenty-eight years of first-class tennis playing and six singles titles, she was again a semi-finalist at Wimbledon but lost to Edith Larcombe, who went on to win the title. Her twenty-fourth and last Wimbledon followed the next year, when she went out early on to Ethel Hannam  (Little and Tingay, 9). She first won the Wimbledon championship in 1886, when she defeated Maud Watson, who had repeated as champion in 1885. She won again in 1889 against Helene Rice, in 1894 against Lucy Austin, and in 1897, 1899, and 1900 against Charlotte Cooper. Her only superior in the early days was Lottie Dod, five-time champion and the greatest sportswoman of the age. Between 1885 and 1901, except on the four occasions when she did not compete, she was either Wimbledon champion or runner-up. The fourteen-year span between her first and last Wimbledon titles is the longest in history, while her last title at the age of thirty-six distinguished her as the second oldest women's singles champion up to 1996.<br>
<br>In addition to her Wimbledon successes, Hillyard won an amazing number of other singles, doubles, and mixed doubles championships, including the Irish, Welsh, north of England, south of England (eleven times between 1885 and 1905), London, Cheltenham, Middlesex, Buxton, Exmouth, English covered court, &#145;All England&#146; doubles, mixed doubles, and married couples, Wimbledon non-championship doubles, German, south of France, and Monte Carlo titles. A tireless tennis enthusiast, she continued to play in public long after her skills had waned, rather than allowing protection of her reputation to interfere with a pastime that gave her immense pleasure.<br>
<br>Blanche Hillyard was the first woman player whose standard of performance could be described as formidable. Her style was not particularly varied and like most of her contemporaries, she played a baseline rather than a volleying game; her backhand was defensive and relatively weak, and her overhand serve, although an unusual stroke for women in her day, was not especially strong. What gave her play distinction was a remarkable natural forehand that had topspin and was much more powerful and accurate than those of her contemporaries, her follow-through going so far that the impact of her right hand and wrist badly bruised the upper part of her left arm and shoulder  (Hillyard, 131). Excellent footwork and great agility and speed, along with clever tactics, good judgement, and intense concentration were also major assets, as were her fierce competitiveness, tremendous determination, dogged persistence, and unfailing self-control. Hillyard never knew when she was beaten or what it was to be too tired to play on. By her own description, her most memorable match was the 1889 Wimbledon final against Helene Rice. Rice won the first set 6 games to 4 and led in the second set 5 games to 3 and 40&#150;15 in the ninth game, before Hillyard staged an extraordinary rally to take the set 8 games to 6 and went on to win a well-fought third set 6 to 4  (Chambers, 113&#150;15).<br>
<br>Unlike many sportswomen, Hillyard did not give up serious competition with marriage and motherhood, although she never allowed her love of tennis to interfere with domestic duties and her championship record is marked by breaks that coincided with periods of family building. To a large extent her social life revolved around tennis. Her courtship with George Hillyard was frequently conducted on the tennis court, and both played competitive tennis on their honeymoon. Commander Hillyard, a fine cricketer and tennis player (especially at doubles), also competed at Wimbledon, although with less success than his wife. More than that, he was one of the founders of the Lawn Tennis Association (1888), and from 1907 to 1924, as secretary of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, he was a great power in the tennis world. The Hillyards' estate at Thorpe Satchville, near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, included a private golf course and tennis court and exuded an uninhibited sporting atmosphere. The Hillyards adored dogs and allowed their pack of pocket beagles and other terriers to wander in and out of the house at will. Hunting and tennis parties, including most of the leading tennis players of the day, were common. Indeed, according to Dame Mabel Brookes, the wife of Norman Brookes, the first Australian to win Wimbledon, Thorpe Satchville was &#145;an institution rather than a house&#146;  (Brookes, 72).<br>
<br>Blanche Hillyard was a tall, plain, athletic-looking woman with a bold, clear signature that reflected her definite, businesslike manner on and off the court. A sports all-rounder who was an excellent horse- and huntswoman (she hunted with the Quorn for thirty years) as well as tennis player, she was known for her exceptional sportsmanship and pleasantness to opponents weak and strong: the frowns that characterized her tennis play resulted from concentration rather than annoyance. She was known also for a minor sartorial eccentricity in that she always played in soft white leather gloves, evidently to assure a firm grip on the racket.<br>
<br>As one of the pre-eminent woman tennis players of her age, Hillyard was asked to contribute articles on tennis to various journals and books, including H. W. W. Wilberforce's <span class="italic">Lawn Tennis</span> (1890) and Lady Greville's edition of <span class="italic">The Gentlewoman's Book of Sports</span> (1892). These reveal that, although far from advocating &#145;women's rights&#146;, she believed in dress reform in sport and that participation in sport advanced the position of women. &#145;In tennis&#146;, she wrote, &#145;our sex can compete with a certain amount of equality with the &#147;lords of creation&#148;&#146;, for playing &#145;promotes &hellip; that coolness of head and judgment which we are so often taunted with lacking&#146;  (Mrs G. Hillyard, &#145;Lawn tennis&#146;, <span class="italic">Young Woman</span>, 2, 1893&#150;4, 370).<br>
<br>Blanche Hillyard's full life and &#145;direct approach kept her bravely active, until at a great age and crippled with arthritis, she cried &#147;enough&#148; and passed on&#146;  (Brookes, 73) at her home, Greenford, Mare Hill, Pulborough, Sussex, on 6 August 1946.<br>
