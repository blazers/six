<span class="headword">Shiels <span class="st"> [Shields]</span>,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">compiler</span>, was born in Roxburghshire, Scotland, about the end of the seventeenth century, to humble parents, and went to London as a journeyman printer. He had little formal education but was possessed of &#145;a very acute understanding&#146;  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 2.329) and a retentive memory.<br>
<br>In 1748 Samuel Johnson, to whom Shiels was further recommended by his devout Jacobitism, employed him as one of six amanuenses on his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, along with the Macbean brothers, Stewart, Maitland, and Peyton. Interestingly, given Johnson's well known views on that nation, all but the last named were Scots. At the conclusion of his work on the <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> in 1752 Shiels was commissioned by the publisher Ralph Griffiths to compile <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, to the Time of Dean Swift</span> (5 vols., 1753), the claim to authorship of which was at the time hotly disputed between him and Theophilus Cibber. Although Shiels was certainly the principal compiler of the work, Cibber had been engaged as editor &#145;with power to alter, expunge, or add, as he liked&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 3.30). The two men were quite opposite in character as in politics: Cibber was something of a dilettante, Shiels pernickety and pedantic; the former as staunch a whig as the latter was devout a tory. As well as correcting his style and making judicious additions Cibber felt bound to excise Shiels's tory sentiments wherever he found them surfacing in the text. Shiels, outraged at the mutilation of his copy, was only dissuaded from challenging Cibber to a duel by the intervention of Griffiths. Cibber's name alone duly appeared on the title-page of the first volume (the later volumes generously allowed &#145;and other hands&#146;). Shiels justifiably felt piqued, although Johnson, always well disposed towards his former employee, went too far when he attributed the whole credit of the work to him  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 2.329). The compilation was in fact largely based on Langbaine and Jacobs, with the aid of Coxeter's notes, and did not contain much original matter.<br>
<br>Apart from his compilations Shiels also wrote poetry, in a style much influenced by that of James Thomson. His verses include <span class="italic">Marriage</span> (1747), a didactic poem in blank verse, and <span class="italic">Beauty</span> (printed in 1766 together with James Grainger's <span class="italic">The Sugar Cane</span> and wrongly ascribed to that author), a piece which contains praise of Johnson's <span class="italic">Irene</span> (1749). Above even Dr Johnson, Shiels venerated his countryman Thomson, on whose death in 1748 he published an elegy of some merit, <span class="italic">Musidorus</span>. Shiels was also Thomson's first biographer (in <span class="italic">Lives of the Poets</span>). However, his admiration seems to have been rather more fatuous than discriminating, if Johnson may be believed: &#145;I took down Thomson, and read aloud a large portion of him, and then asked,&#151;Is not this fine? Shiels having expressed the highest admiration. Well, Sir, (said I,) I have omitted every other line&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 3.37).<br>
<br>Shiels died of consumption in May's Buildings, London, on 27 December 1753. Johnson, who had frequently afforded Shiels financial aid during his last illness, provided his epitaph: &#145;his life was virtuous, and his end was pious&#146;  (Johnson, <span class="italic">Poets</span>, 2.329).<br>
