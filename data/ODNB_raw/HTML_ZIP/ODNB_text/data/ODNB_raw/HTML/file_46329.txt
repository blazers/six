<span class="headword">Morgan,  George Campbell</span>  (1863&#150;1945), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, was born on 9 December 1863 at 12 Cutwell Street, Tetbury, Gloucestershire, the second child of George Morgan (1828&#150;1907), unattached minister, and his wife, Elizabeth Fawn Brittan (<i>d</i>. 1911). His father was a Baptist minister before working as an independent preacher. Soon after Morgan's birth the family moved to Roath in south Wales and began attending a Wesleyan Methodist church. At first Morgan was educated at home, but after a family move to Cheltenham he attended Gratton House School in the town. He preached his first sermon in Monmouth Methodist Chapel in 1876, at the age of thirteen.<br>
<br>After an adolescent crisis of faith, Morgan had to abandon plans for a university education in order to earn his own living. A year in a teaching post in the Wesleyan School for Boys in Birmingham was followed in 1883 by three years in a similar post in the Jewish Collegiate School for Boys. Here his interest in Hebrew and the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> was stimulated, and the principal, Lawrence Levy, became a personal friend. His interest in preaching was unabated, and while acting as one of the team of helpers on the occasion of the visit of Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey to Birmingham in 1883 he became convinced of a vocation to preach. When he was made redundant because of the imminent closure of the collegiate school, he applied to the Wesleyan Methodist church as a candidate for ministry, but was rejected. This did not dim his resolve, and he continued with mission preaching in Hull, following the work of the evangelist Gypsy Smith.<br>
<br>Three months after his rejection Morgan married his cousin, Annie (always known as Nancy) Morgan, on 20 August 1888. He soon received a call to minister to the Congregational church in Stone, Staffordshire, where he began a two-year ministry on 18 August 1889. He was ordained on 22 September and the following day received into the Congregational Union as an accredited minister.<br>
<br>There followed three further ministries in England, at Rugeley (1891&#150;3), Westminster Road, Birmingham (1893&#150;7), and New Court, Tollington Park, north London (1897&#150;1901). During these years Morgan began the systematic <span class="roman">Bible</span> lectures which formed an essential part of his ministry, and began his regular visits to the United States. He made a deep impression on D. L. Moody and on many others when he participated in the Northfield summer conference. After Moody's death in 1899 his son, Will Moody, invited Morgan to carry forward the work of the Northfield extension programme. He left London in 1901 and travelled all over the United States engaged in this work for the next three years. Chicago Theological Seminary conferred the degree of DD on him in 1902.<br>
<br>Under repeated pressure to return to his homeland Morgan accepted a call to Westminster Chapel, in central London, in 1904. Despite an initially small congregation in a large building, this proved to be the scene of his greatest work during two outstanding ministries (1904&#150;17 and 1933&#150;43). Here he became known as one of the world's finest expository preachers. A tall, lean, striking figure in the pulpit, with a strong, well-modulated voice, he attracted congregations of more than 1500 to his regular Friday evening <span class="roman">Bible</span> lectures. He did not engage in theological controversy, but throughout his life concentrated on the detailed study and exposition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His great work was preaching, whether in London at the weekends, elsewhere during the week, or at the annual Mundesley <span class="roman">Bible</span> conferences in Norfolk. A staff of assistants carried on the regular activities of the church. For three years, from 1911 until 1914, he also made time to combine his London weekend ministry with the training of future Congregational ministers as president of Cheshunt College, Cambridge (where he was the inspiration behind a new building programme).<br>
<br>Morgan resigned from Westminster Chapel in 1917 and, after short spells of lecturing at the YMCA's Mildmay College and a brief ministry at Highbury Quadrant Church, he returned to the United States in 1919, and remained until 1932. At first he had an itinerant ministry based in Indianapolis and then in Athens, Georgia; there followed work at the Biblical Institute in Los Angeles, ministry at Tabernacle Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, and teaching at Gordon College, Boston.<br>
<br>In 1933 Morgan began his second ministry at Westminster Chapel (at first in collaboration with Hubert Simpson, later with Martyn Lloyd-Jones). His expository preaching continued unabated until his health began to give way in 1943, leading to his resignation. He died at home, 345 St Ermins, Westminster, on 16 May 1945, and was cremated three days later at Golders Green. A memorial service was held in Westminster Chapel on 28 May. He and his wife had four sons (all of whom followed their father into ordained ministry) and three daughters (one of whom died in childhood). Morgan published more than forty books, most of them based on his biblical expositions, which had a wide circulation in the English-speaking world.<br>
