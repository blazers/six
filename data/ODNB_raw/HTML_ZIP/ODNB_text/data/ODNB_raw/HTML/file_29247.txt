<span class="headword">White,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1775, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">author and advertising agent</span>, was baptized on 17 April 1775 in Worcester, the third son of Samuel White of Bewdley, Worcestershire, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willes. He spent &#145;many of the earliest days of [his] youth&#146; &#145;in the Neighbourhood&#146; of the Malvern Hills  (White, fol. 6). On 19 September 1783 he was admitted to Christ's Hospital on the presentation of Thomas Coventry. At school he seemed something of a dandy: Leigh Hunt recalled &#145;admir[ing] his handsome appearance, and unimprovable manner of wearing his new clothes&#146;  (Hunt, 2.122). White left the school on 30 April 1790, but continued at Christ's Hospital, working as a clerk in the treasurer's office. A friendship with Charles Lamb, begun in their student days, now ripened. By the mid-1790s White was Lamb's &#145;most familiar friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</span>, 6.286).<br>
<br>Lamb introduced White to Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> and White, a natural humorist, developed a powerful imaginative identification with Falstaff. He would &#145;talk you nothing but pure <i>Falstaff</i> the long evenings through&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Charles and Mary Lamb</span>, 1.229) and occasionally dressed up as Shakespeare's comic hero. He was even known among his friends as Sir John. This fascination with Falstaff culminated in <span class="italic">Original Letters, &amp;c. of Sir John Falstaff and his Friends &hellip; from Genuine Manuscripts</span> (1796), written with Lamb's assistance. The volume was designed pleasantly to ridicule William Henry Ireland's recent &#145;discovery&#146; (forgery) of Shakespeare's manuscripts, though Lamb later liked to emphasize the purely literary value of the <span class="italic">Letters</span>, deriving, he said, &#145;from the fullness of a young soul, newly kindling at the Shakspearian flame, and bursting to be delivered of a rich exuberance of conceits&#146;  (ibid.). <span class="italic">Letters</span> was not a success on its first publication (there were, however, several posthumous editions) and appears to have been White's only attempt at authorship. In 1800 he founded an advertising agency in Warwick Square which moved to 33 Fleet Street about 1808. This was, arguably, the first such agency to introduce the idea of writing copy for clients' advertisements.<br>
<br>White had romantic ideas about the feasting practised in &#145;Old&#146; England and took over Elizabeth Montagu's role as patron of May day feasts for London's chimney sweepers. He served sausages instead of beef and pudding, acting as head waiter himself: Lamb gives an unforgettable account of these occasions in his essay &#145;The praise of chimney-sweepers&#146;. White married Margaret Faulder (1792&#150;1864), daughter of Robert Faulder, a bookseller, in 1811, and they had six children. He died at his house in Burton Crescent, London, on 13 March 1820, leaving a sizeable fortune, and was buried in Paddington churchyard. Friends remembered him as a man of unmatched good humour and drollness. In 1822 Lamb wrote: &#145;He [White] carried away with him half the fun of the world when he died&#151;of my world at least&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Charles and Mary Lamb</span>, 2.130). White's advertising agency, subsequently R. F. White &amp; Son Ltd, remained in the hands of his family until the death of his great-grandson, Gilbert White, in 1962.<br>
