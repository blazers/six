<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cunningham, Sir  John Henry Dacres</span>  (1885&#150;1962), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 13 April 1885 at Demerara, British Guiana, the son of Henry Hutt Cunningham QC (1851&#150;1897), the stipendiary magistrate in the British colony, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary (1855&#150;1897), the daughter of the Revd John Park. Cunningham was not yet a teenager when he and his younger sister, Barbara, were orphaned as a result of a seafaring accident that claimed the lives of both of their parents. Brought back to England in the wake of this double tragedy, the two children were brought up by their mother's relatives in Ulverston, on the fringes of the Lake District.<br>
<br>John Cunningham's scholastic talents were quickly in evidence at Stubbington House School and shone through his time as a cadet in HMS <i>Britannia</i> (1900&#150;01), where he was regarded as possessing one of the finest intellects seen in the training ship in recent years. Unfortunately, his social skills left much to be desired. Apart from doing nothing to cultivate popularity he was generally seen as being a rather morose, impatient, and disdainful individual who rarely praised anyone and was often withering in his criticism of those whose work did not measure up to the highest standards he set for them. An aloof and introverted figure known for his biting sarcasm, Cunningham made few friends either at school or within the service. But if being a loner discomforted him he showed little sign of it at any stage of his life or during his career. Self-assured to the point of arrogance and immensely hard-working, Cunningham was highly competitive and relished pitting himself against even the most difficult of challenges. A shrewd and complex personality, he managed to gain the respect but not the devotion of his peers and subordinates.<br>
<br>After passing out of <i>Britannia</i> in 1901 he was posted as a midshipman to the cruiser HMS <i>Gibraltar</i>, the flagship on the Cape of Good Hope station, at the time of the South African War. Awarded the queen's medal, Cunningham returned home in 1904 as a sub-lieutenant to take the qualifying examinations for promotion to lieutenant. Achieving a first-class certificate in all five subjects (a so-called &#145;five-oner&#146;), he was promoted in October 1905. Opting to eschew gunnery for the less glamorous field of navigation as his specialization, he duly qualified at the navigation school and was thereafter appointed as assistant navigator in the battleship HMS <i>Illustrious</i>. During the next three years he graduated to the role of navigator of the gunboat <i>Hebe</i>, the cruiser <i>Indefatigable</i> in the West Indies, and the minelayer <i>Iphigenia</i> in home waters. He was little inconvenienced by the rigours of the first-class ship course in 1910 and was rewarded with an instructor's position at the navigation school. In the same year, on 8 March, he married his first cousin Dorothy May (<i>d</i>. 1959), daughter of C. K. Hannay. Cunningham had spent some of his early adolescence in Ulverston with Dorothy after his parents had perished at sea. They were married for forty-nine years and had two sons, John and Richard; John became a fire brigade chief and Richard a lieutenant in the Submarine Service, killed in action on board <i>P33</i> in August 1941.<br>
<br>Cunningham went back to sea in 1911 as navigator in the cruiser <i>Berwick</i> on the West Indies station and in 1915 was transferred to the ill-fated battleship <i>Russell</i> in the Mediterranean. Surviving her sinking by a mine in Maltese waters in April 1916, Cunningham was appointed navigator in the battle cruiser <i>Renown</i>. While serving in the Mediterranean he was promoted commander in 1917, and in the final year of the war became navigator of the <i>Lion</i> in the Grand Fleet. Further preferment came his way when he was appointed to serve as navigator in the newly commissioned battle cruiser <i>Hood</i> in 1920 and as squadron navigator for the entire battle-cruiser squadron commanded at the time by Sir Roger Keyes. He returned ashore in 1922 to serve as commander of the navigation school and followed this a year later by appointment as master of the fleet in the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, the flagship of Admiral Sir John de Robeck. Promoted captain in 1924 he served for a time on the staff of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich before becoming deputy director of plans at Admiralty House. After commanding the cruiser&#150;minelayer <i>Adventure</i> (1928&#150;9), he returned to Whitehall as director of plans (1930&#150;32) at a time of economic crisis for the entire country. Emerging from a torrid period for the Royal Navy, Cunningham was glad to go back to sea and take command of the battleship <i>Resolution</i> while becoming flag captain to Admiral Sir William Fisher, the commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. After being appointed aide-de-camp to the king in 1935 Cunningham reached flag rank in 1936 at the age of fifty-one. Later in the year he was offered the post of assistant chief of naval staff. This brought him into close contact with the influential figure of Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield, the first sea lord. Cunningham's workload increased substantially in 1937 when he assumed responsibility for administering the Fleet Air Arm upon its transfer from the Air Ministry to the Admiralty. His new role initially brought with it a slight change of designation, but the importance of his duties was reflected in the elevation of the office in 1938 to that of fifth sea lord and chief of naval air services with a seat on the Board of Admiralty. He was made MVO in 1924 and CB in 1937.<br>
<br>As Europe began gearing up for war in the early summer of 1939 Cunningham was promoted vice-admiral and was ordered to take command of the 1st cruiser squadron in the Mediterranean, flying his flag in the <i>Devonshire</i>. Shortly after war broke out in September, Cunningham's cruiser squadron returned to reinforce the Home Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Forbes. Assigned to the Norwegian campaign from the outset, Cunningham made the best of a desperately poor job. His finest hour came, ironically, in the wake of the allied defeat when he was asked to lead a mixed force of three cruisers, nine destroyers, and three French transports to the port of Namsos, to the north of Trondheim, in order to evacuate the roughly 5700 allied troops of &#145;Mauriceforce&#146; that had congregated there. Arriving off Namsos during the night of 1 May, Cunningham postponed the evacuation by twenty-four hours in the hope that the beautifully clear weather would deteriorate and help to conceal the mass evacuation. On the evening of 2 May a bank of fog obligingly descended, shrouding the evacuation operation from the German Luftwaffe and allowing the entire &#145;Mauriceforce&#146; to be spirited away from Namsos in a single heroic night's work. Although badly mauled by bombing and strafing the next day, Cunningham's diminished task force returned with its human cargo safely to Scapa Flow a few days later.<br>
<br>Cunningham's next major assignment took him back across the North Sea and well into the Arctic circle to the port of Troms&oslash; on 7 June in order to rescue King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olaf, and other members of the Norwegian royal family, along with government ministers and the country's gold reserve. Under strict instructions not to break radio silence, Cunningham in the <i>Devonshire</i> had picked up his evacuees and was on his return leg to the United Kingdom when his ship received a garbled distress call from the British carrier HMS <i>Glorious</i>&#151;only some 70 miles away&#151;which was being engaged by vastly superior enemy forces. Whether a narrow sense of duty or mere callous self-preservation dictated his total lack of response one will never know, but his inaction effectively left the crew of the <i>Glorious</i> and her two screening destroyers&#151;HMS <i>Acasta</i> and HMS <i>Ardent</i>&#151;to fend for themselves against overwhelming odds. Despite taking the fight courageously to the German battle cruisers <i>Scharnhorst</i> and <i>Gneisenau</i>, the unequal contest was soon over and all three British warships were sunk with the loss of 1519 officers and men. Only forty-six survived their freezing ordeal in the North Sea. In recent years criticism of Cunningham's role in this tragedy has surfaced. Throughout his life Cunningham claimed not to have received any information about the distress call from <i>Glorious</i>. This view was sharply contested in a British television documentary on the subject aired in 1997, featuring a prominent member of the wireless telegraphy staff on board the <i>Devonshire</i> who could remember receiving the message and entering it into the wireless telegraphy log at the time. It is further alleged that Cunningham either personally doctored the ship's log to eliminate any mention of the SOS call or ordered that any evidence of it be struck from the record. Until the Admiralty opens all the files relating to this incident in 2015, and perhaps not even then, this matter will remain unresolved.<br>
<br>Cunningham's burgeoning career prospects were not arrested by this incident, however, and he continued to take on new assignments. He confronted his trickiest task yet in September 1940 when he was appointed joint commander with Major-General N. M. S. Irwin of operation Menace&#151;an effort to land a mixed force of 6670 British and Free French soldiers at Dakar in Senegal in a bid to provide a base for General de Gaulle's Free French movement in west Africa. This expedition turned out to be an ignoble failure, undermined by a lack of secrecy and co-ordination on the one hand and compromised by resolute Vichy French hostility and defensive firepower on the other. Once again Cunningham somehow emerged unscathed from this latest d&eacute;b&acirc;cle and the Admiralty was content to support him in his seemingly unstoppable drive to get to the top of his profession.<br>
<br>Knighted in the new year's honours, Cunningham was recalled to the Admiralty in the early months of 1941 and appointed fourth sea lord and chief of supplies and transport. This proved to be a very demanding administrative position, but Cunningham was ideally suited to deal with the complexities of the job and revelled in the myriad aspects of it. He remained at the helm for more than two years before being sent in June 1943 to the eastern Mediterranean as commander-in-chief, Levant, with the acting rank of admiral. Promotion to admiral followed in August and when the two Mediterranean commands were merged later in the year he was confirmed as the commander-in-chief and assumed the responsibility for all allied warships in the same theatre. Admittedly, by this time the naval situation in the Mediterranean had improved significantly, but there were still important amphibious operations to launch at Anzio and in the south of France, both of which he oversaw.<br>
<br>Cunningham remained in the Mediterranean until he was brought home to relieve Admiral Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope as first sea lord in May 1946. While he could be satisfied that he was the first navigating officer ever to have made it to the pinnacle of his profession, Cunningham was under no illusions about the problems he had inherited from his namesake. Substantial budget cuts and disarmament had already taken place and more of the same were in the pipeline. To make matters worse the sharp divisions that existed within the chiefs of staff committee made Cunningham's task of defending the integrity of the Royal Navy even more complicated. Undermined by personal wrangling and animosity, the committee proved to be utterly ineffectual, both collectively and individually, in resisting the Labour government's radical plans for the armed services over the next two years. Presiding over an almost skeletal navy was not particularly edifying for a person of Cunningham's nature, so when the opportunity to retire from the service presented itself in September 1948 he grasped it with some alacrity. By then he had been made a GCB in 1946, a freeman of the City of London in the following year, and had been promoted to admiral of the fleet in January 1948. He had also received a set of distinguished orders and decorations from France, Greece, Norway, and the United States for his work on their behalf in the recent war. After leaving the navy Cunningham spent the next ten years as chairman of the Iraq Petroleum Company before retiring finally in 1958 at the age of seventy-three. He survived his wife by three years and died in the Middlesex Hospital on 13 December 1962.<br>
<br>Vain and egotistical, as well as being a strict disciplinarian who insisted on precision and hated any slack attitude and inattention to detail from those who worked for him, Cunningham was known to be a formidable character. Astute and experienced in driving both ships and men, there is no doubt that he accomplished much in his life, but the nagging doubt remains as to the soundness of his judgement under all circumstances, particularly at sea.<br>
