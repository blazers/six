<span class="headword">Grant,  James</span>  (1750&#150;1808), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and author</span>, was born on 30 May 1750 at Shewglie, Glen Urquhart, Inverness-shire, the son of the laird of Shewglie. In 1768 he gained, via his uncle Alexander Grant, an appointment in Bengal with the East India Company. He arrived the following year, but, because he did not get a regular position, his early years are difficult to trace in the company's records, which seem at times to confuse him with another James Grant then in Bengal. According to his own account, although not officially employed, he became involved in the Dacca district with collecting the revenue during the great famine that devastated Bengal in 1770. He returned to Great Britain in 1774, but went back to India, where he had a number of relatives; one of these, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11248/', "Charles Grant")</script>, later became a dominant figure in the East India Company in London. He was sent to Masulipatam, in the territory known as the Northern Circars, which had been ceded to the company by the nizam of Hyderabad.<br>
<br>In 1781 Grant was appointed assistant to the company's resident at the nizam's court in Hyderabad, a position that required, according to Grant, getting the nizam to pay the company money that he had promised and convincing him that the British had no sinister designs on his territory  (BL OIOC, Home miscellaneous series, 219.5). In the following year he became the resident, but remained in Masulipatam until his appointment ended in 1784, claiming ill health as an excuse for not going to Hyderabad. He spent his time in gathering information on the revenue system of the Northern Circars and of the neighbouring rulers, arguing that, while he had not been asked to do this, it was essential for the company to know the true value of its possessions. He had gained, he said, &#145;priceless knowledge of political arithmetic&#146; that would become the foundation of a kind of empire that was &#145;perfectly new in the political history of the world&#146;  (Firminger, 2.164, 3.3). He continued his researches on the much larger and more important area of Bengal. These were first sent to the governor-general as a memorandum, part of which was later published in England as <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature of the Zamindery Tenures in the Landed Property of Bengal</span> (1791).<br>
<br>The great question that the British had to answer as they took over rule in Bengal and elsewhere in India was, Grant said, &#145;Who owns the land?&#146; He argued that in India, throughout recorded history, the sovereign was the sole and universal proprietor of the land. Private ownership of land in the European sense was unknown, and the peasants who worked the land paid, either directly to the sovereign or through intermediary officials known as <i>zamindars</i>, a part of the produce as rent for usage. As the central authority declined, these officials claimed to be the actual owners of the land, but were in fact, he insisted, only tax-collectors. His arguments had immediate practical significance, because, if true, the East India Company, which had replaced the Mughal emperor as sovereign, owned the land. Furthermore, he showed through a minute examination of land records that the Bengal territories were capable of providing far more revenue, as they had been under-assessed since the British took over, and, moreover, the <i>zamindars</i> were &#145;ignorant, merciless despots&#146;, who had stolen vast sums that should have gone to the company.<br>
<br>Grant's work was central to the ongoing debate over how Bengal should be governed, what the revenue assessment should be, and how the revenue should be collected. This involved him with the leading figures in the company's administration, including Warren Hastings and Philip Francis. His views were strenuously opposed by John Shore, adviser to the governor-general, Lord Cornwallis, who argued that while Grant had done an astonishing amount of work, it was based on a misreading of the record. In practical terms, what mattered was that the company had neither the personnel nor the knowledge to do without the <i>zamindars</i>. Shore therefore insisted that a revenue settlement should be made with them as <i>de facto</i> owners of the land. Grant's knowledge of the details of revenue collection was recognized by his appointment in 1785 to the office of <i>sheristadar</i>, or keeper of accounts, to prevent fraud on the part of the local accountants. There is not much evidence that he had the administrative skills or the power, despite his vast knowledge, to bring about any real changes. Nevertheless, as a critic of his work has put it, students of the history of Bengal and Bihar must turn to his researches when they undertake &#145;to recover the past history of any given district within these provinces&#146;  (Firminger, 2.xviii). In addition to his study of <i>zamindar</i> tenures Grant also published <span class="italic">A Political Survey of Northern Circars</span> (1784) and historical and comparative analyses of the finances and revenues of Bengal (1786 and 1788).<br>
<br>When under John Shore's influence the office of <i>sheristadar</i> was abolished in 1789, Grant was offered a post as collector, or chief official of a revenue district. This, however, he refused and returned to Scotland. He purchased the Redcastle estate in Ross-shire, styling himself &#145;Grant of Redcastle&#146;. He proposed marriage to Maria Grant, the daughter of his cousin Charles Grant, who had also returned from Bengal a wealthy man, but she refused him, perhaps because she was thirty years younger, but also because James did not share the intense evangelical religious views of her father. Charles Grant had once commented, after James had visited him in Bengal, that, while his knowledge of Indian revenue systems &#145;must set him before all that have yet treated of them&#146;, he was &#145;filled with this world and regardless of another&#146;  (Morris, 83). Maria remained on good terms with him, however, and she was with him when he died, unmarried, on 22 October 1808, at Ruxley Lodge, near Esher in Surrey. His cousin Colonel Alexander Grant inherited Redcastle, but he left legacies to Maria and her sisters.<br>
