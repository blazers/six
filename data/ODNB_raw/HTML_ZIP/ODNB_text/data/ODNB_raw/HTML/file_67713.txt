<span class="headword">Marsin <span class="st"> [Mersin, Mercin]</span>,  M.</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1696&#150;1701), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, is somebody about whose life absolutely nothing is known beyond the very scanty personal information contained in her published works. Internal evidence confirms that she was female, and that during the mid-1690s she travelled some hundred miles to London in order to publish her views. Beyond this, her life is a closed book. She is generally credited with having written a guide to marriage for women in 1683, but it was in the period 1696&#150;1701 that she published the vast majority of her fifteen pamphlets and books, and during which she developed her unique method of biblical exegesis and a powerful critique of male authority in both religion and society as a whole.<br>
<br>Marsin was first encouraged to develop her own analysis of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1696 when, in response to what she perceived as sure signs of the second coming of Christ, she was struck by<blockquote>a fervent longing desire for the coming of the Lord &hellip; whereupon I took to the Lord's direction, resolving to search the scriptures with more diligence than ever I had done; the which I no sooner had performed, but I found the certainty of the coming of the Lord, and that it was very nigh at hand; but still I was to seek how, and in what manner; for I could then no ways make the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> agree. (<span class="italic">Near Approach of Christ's Kingdom</span>, Preface)</blockquote>Her first pamphlet after this conversion experience is dedicated to simply recounting the signs of the second coming as they appeared to her. Earthquakes, comets, and the European wars of the period were all important indicators, and to this extent she conforms to a relatively common form of millenarian thinking at the end of the seventeenth century. But she also points to the &#145;miraculous cure of four women&#146; in the city of London, and to Christ's &#145;working of miracles on women&#146; in general, prefiguring the substantive critique of gender and women's role in Christianity which she was to develop over the next five years.<br>
<br>In the second half of the 1690s Marsin published a series of pamphlets in rapid succession unfolding her method of distinguishing the metaphorical, or &#145;figurative&#146;, elements of the Old and New Testaments from those passages she counts as literal description. Throughout, she sets herself in opposition to a scholastic tradition of biblical scholarship and suggests that the failures of that tradition were essentially the failures of men in general and of patriarchal authority in particular. More than this, she claims that the new insights and growing knowledge of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> which her new method allowed was published through her as a woman precisely because of the previous failure of men to understand God's word and, by extension, their failure to fulfil God's design.<br>
<br>Marsin's last two pamphlets, <span class="italic">Good News to the Good Women</span> and <span class="italic">Two Remarkable Females of Womankind</span>, both published in 1701, contain her most explicit and consistent critique of Christian patriarchy. In <span class="italic">Good News to the Good Women</span> she essentially claims that although Eve acted in ignorance when she succumbed to the blandishments of the serpent in the Garden of Eden, God had visited patriarchy and the pain of childbirth on women as a temporary punishment for Eve's actions. She also suggests that men and women had been equal partners in the Garden of Eden, and that they would be so again after the resurrection; that<blockquote>then the punishment that sin brought into the world will be excluded from all God's people, so as then the husband will not be above the wife nor the wife above the husband &hellip; women will be delivered from that bondage which some has found intolerable. (Marsin, <span class="italic">Good News</span>, 4)</blockquote>More than this, in these two pamphlets of 1701 Marsin expresses a firm belief that she has been appointed by God to publish his word, and that her sex is consistent with a broader pattern of revelation in which women would have a greater part than men. These later pamphlets are largely taken up with a rendition of the roles of women in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> and in the exercise of authority. She makes a great deal of the relationship of the Virgin Mary to the Holy Ghost, and the extent to which men were essentially excluded from the birth and creation of Christ, and were likewise largely responsible for his crucifixion. She also attacks St Paul's interdiction on women as teachers and preachers, and claims that the internal contradictions in St Paul's statements entirely negate his authority in this matter.<br>
<br>By the publication of her final pamphlet, <span class="italic">Two Remarkable Females of Womankind</span>, Marsin had created an essentially female-centred story of biblical history, in which the Virgin Mary and a latter-day prophetess (presumably M. Marsin) are the key figures in the transitions between the various stages of Christian eschatology.<br>
<br>Simply in terms of her statement of a radical adherence to gender equality, Marsin is a unique figure in the history of late seventeenth-century Britain. She is more directly concerned with issues of gender than are the many Quaker prophetesses of the second half of the century, and develops a more sharply focused and coherent analysis of the role of women in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and in Christianity than do any of her radical protestant contemporaries. Several of her pamphlets are dedicated to William III and parliament, and she makes positive reference to the prophetic writings of George Wither, but she gives no clear indication of any sectarian allegiance. While she is clearly a protestant, her views do not conform to any of the plethora of theological positions which characterize British and European protestantism at the end of the seventeenth century. She is a unique figure with a unique theological perspective and methodology, and can only be described as the first and only &#145;Marsinite&#146;.<br>
