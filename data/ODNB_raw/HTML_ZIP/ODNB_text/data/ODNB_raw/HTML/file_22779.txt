<span class="headword">Pricket,  Robert</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1603&#150;1645), <span class="occ">poet</span>, saw some military service in Elizabeth I's reign and afterwards sought a precarious livelihood as a verse-writer and pamphleteer against those holding unorthodox religious and political beliefs. One of his earliest publications, <span class="italic">Times Anotomie</span>, which he describes as a love song on the death of Queen Elizabeth, was published in 1606, three years after the queen's death. In 1603 he printed two panegyrical celebrations of the accession of James I. <span class="italic">A Souldier's Wish unto his Soveraigne Lord King James</span> was entered in the Stationers' register in April; it was dedicated to the privy council in a passage anticipating James's arrival and emphasizing Pricket's own loyalty. Similarly <span class="italic">Unto the most High and Mightie Prince King James. A Poore Subject Sendeth a Souldiours Resolution</span> reiterated these themes before panegyrizing Queen Elizabeth, denouncing the church of Rome, and articulating hopes for sustainable peace and unity. These pledges were made particularly pertinent by Pricket's suspected involvement in the pro-Catholic activities of Philip May, a servant of Lord Hunsdon, for which he was examined on 19 April 1603  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1603</i>, 14/1/31, 33).<br>
<br>In 1604 Pricket secured wider fame by a poetic tribute to the memory of the second earl of Essex, entitled <span class="italic">Honors Fame in Triumph Riding, or, The Life and Death of the Late Honourable Earle of Essex</span> and dedicated to the earls of Southampton and Devonshire and to William, Lord Knollys. Pricket referred with satisfaction to the disgrace of Cobham, Grey, and Ralegh, but the praise he bestowed on Essex&#151;<blockquote>
<div>He doubtles had a sound and faithfull hart.<br>
</div>
<div>To Prince and State, and for the publicke weale,<br>
</div>
<div>The things amisse he alwaies fought to heale.<br>
</div> (stanza 9)</blockquote>&#151;led to his imprisonment by order of the privy council and to the recall of copies of the verse  (<span class="italic">Gawdy MSS</span>). He successfully appealed to Lord Salisbury for release in September 1604 and he sought to atone for his offence in <span class="italic">Times Anotomie, Containing: the Poore Man's Plaint, Britton's Trouble and her Triumph</span>. Dedicated to the privy council, the first part had been written in 1604 and is a bitter attack on Roman Catholicism and contemporary secular abuses.<br>
<br>Pricket's protestant zeal steadily increased. In 1607 he printed both <span class="italic">The Jesuits Miracles, or, New Popish Wonders</span>, a critical account of Jesuit activities in England, culminating in a prayer for stability, and a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Lord Coke his Speech and Charge. With a Discoverie of the Abuses and Corruption of Officers</span>. In the dedication to the latter, signed R. P. and addressed to Coke's father-in-law, Thomas Cecil, earl of Exeter, Pricket described himself as a poor soldier &#145;unseperably Yoakt with leane-fac't povertie&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>), willing, once more, to resume his military career to acquire solvency  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 24.iii, Pricket to the privy council, 1606 or earlier). In a closing request for patronage he represents his text as a verbatim account of a charge given by Coke to the grand jury at Norwich assizes on 4 August 1606: &#145;So exelent as that it worthyly deserves to be continued in perpetuall memorie which being thus prodused to a publique view, I hope it shall unto our publickeweale remaine a worthy persedent&#146;  (sig. A4<i>r</i>). On 12 February, however, one day after the text was released, it was suppressed and, in 1608, in the preface to <span class="italic">La sept part des reports S. Edw. Coke Chivaler</span>, it was repudiated by Coke himself, who condemned its &#145;palpalde mistakings in the very words of art, and the whole context of that rude and ragged stile, wholly dissonant &hellip; from a lawyers dialect&#146; (sig. aV<i>v</i>; <span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.243, Chamberlain to Carleton, 13 Feb 1607).<br>
<br>About the same period Pricket, according to his own account, took holy orders; one &#145;Robert Pricket, A. M.&#146; was curate of St Botolph, Aldgate, in April 1611  (Newcourt, 1.916). He obtained some preferment in Ireland but, exiled by the rising of 1641, and in great distress, he sought refuge in Bath, where in 1645 he wrote <span class="italic">Newes from the King's Bath</span>. Printed at his own expense this work catalogues and criticizes examples of political and religious rebellion. In the dedication of the text Pricket retrospectively examines his life of military campaigning, wrangles with the court of high commission, and forty years in God's ministry with dejected cynicism and frustration:<blockquote>
<div>I am alive as buried in my grave<br>
</div>
<div>With grief I see the wofull misery<br>
</div>
<div>Of honest, poor, dispised poverty.<br>
</div> (p. 3)</blockquote>
