<span class="headword">Stuart,  William</span>  (1755&#150;1822), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born on 15 March 1755, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26716/', "John Stuart, third earl of Bute (1713&#150;1792)")</script>, prime minister, and Mary Wortley Montagu (1718&#150;1794), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19013/', "Edward Wortley Montagu")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19029/', "Lady Mary Wortley Montagu")</script>. His siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64138/', "John Stuart, first marquess of Bute")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26697/', "Sir Charles Stuart (1753&#150;1801)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/42015/', "Lady Louisa Stuart")</script>. He was educated at Winchester College and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1774. Shortly after being ordained in 1779 he was appointed vicar of Luton, Bedfordshire. He was made DD in 1789 and in the same year became a canon of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1793 he was appointed bishop of St David's and in December 1800 he became archbishop of Armagh and primate of all Ireland. On 3 May 1796 at St George's, Hanover Square, he married Sophia Margaret Juliana Penn (<i>d</i>. 1847), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21855/', "Thomas Penn (1702&#150;1775)")</script>, colonial politician, and Lady Juliana Fermor.<br>
<br>Stuart's correspondence with his fellow archbishop and confidant Charles Brodrick of Cashel shows him to have been a stern and somewhat intemperate critic of many of his fellow bishops. He wrote that Bishop Stopford of Cork showed a &#145;total incapacity to attend to the duties of his diocese&#146;  (Brodrick MSS, 3 June 1805), that Bishop Knox of Derry was &#145;the mere echo of the Castle&#146;  (ibid., 10 April 1805), and that William Magee, while doing damage in the episcopal college, could do little as a bishop  (ibid., 29 March 1813). He maintained that the educational interests of the Church of Ireland were endangered, &#145;so ignorant are some of their lordships&#146;  (ibid., 3 Feb 1808), while the English bishops showed little interest in Irish affairs  (ibid., 1 Oct 1805). His strictures against the church's performance in general embraced in particular its neglect of education, for which in large measure he blamed lack of clerical zeal. He criticized the high incidence of non-residence among the clergy, and on unsubstantiated moral grounds objected (unavailingly) to the translation into his province of Bishop George de la Poer Beresford, a member of a family that was highly influential in church and state. Being virtually independent of political patronage, he used his high office to institute reforms, especially through the resources of the board of first fruits. He was a diligent chairman of the Irish board of education inquiry, which issued fourteen important reports between 1809 and 1813. Stuart died of accidental poisoning at his London home at Hill Street, Berkeley Square, on 6 May 1822 and was buried at Luton Park, Bedfordshire.<br>
