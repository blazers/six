<span class="headword">Hinchley,  John William</span>  (1871&#150;1931), <span class="occ">chemical engineer</span>, was born on 21 January 1871 in Grantham, the fourth in the family of nine children of John Hinchley (<i>d</i>. 1913), plough fitter and Methodist lay preacher, and his wife, Eliza Holland (<i>d</i>. 1932), a worker in a lace factory. His education was hampered by lack of money but, following the family's move to Lincoln in 1872, he attended John Holton's school until 1881, when he won a scholarship to Lincoln grammar school. Between school hours he earned money cleaning and mending clocks and watches for a local clockmaker. After leaving school, he became an engineering apprentice with Ruston Proctor &amp; Co. Ltd of Lincoln (1887&#150;90), also attending evening classes at Lincoln School of Science. For one year, 1891&#150;2, he taught science at a boys' school in Eastbourne, Sussex. In 1892 he moved to London and graduated in mining in 1896 at the Royal School of Mines. In 1903 he married Edith Mary, daughter of John Mason, whom he had met while she was at the Royal College of Art.<br>
<br>Graduation was followed by a difficult period in consulting, and Hinchley's appointment as assayist to the royal mint of Bangkok in 1903 was a welcome relief; his wife joined him there in 1904. They returned from Siam in 1907 and Hinchley started consulting again, covering topics as diverse as sherardizing and the manufacture of composition billiard balls. Another consulting activity which lasted until his death concerned the manufacture of pencils, which took him to various parts of Europe.<br>
<br>It was later that Hinchley became a teacher of chemical engineering, starting in 1909 with an evening course of twenty-five lectures and practical work at Battersea Polytechnic. He moved to Imperial College in 1911, was appointed assistant professor of chemical engineering in 1917, and was elevated to the chair in 1926. Hinchley's courses included a practical element: his earliest students learned to erect experimental plant and do pipe fitting. His methods trained men to work well in the chemical industry of the day.<br>
<br>Parallel with his teaching was Hinchley's concern with professional bodies. His work led to the formation in 1919 of the chemical engineering group of the Society of Chemical Industry. This was not enough: he pursued with renewed vigour his ideal of a qualifying body and, following many meetings of kindred enthusiasts, the Institution of Chemical Engineers was incorporated on 21 December 1922 with Hinchley as its first honorary secretary. One who attended these meetings described Hinchley as an enthusiast, &#145;obviously highly strung, quick in thought and rapid in speech, as though his overfilled brain could scarcely get rid of the thoughts and ideas quickly enough&#151;sensitive to a hostile audience but quick to respond to a friendly one&#146;.<br>
<br>Hinchley was a balanced man who never allowed the professor or the scientist to take over his life. His leisure was as full and useful as his working hours. In later life he became a devoted freemason. After a short illness, Hinchley was taken to the Freemasons' Hospital in Chelsea where, following an operation, he died on 13 August 1931; he was cremated at Golders Green crematorium, where his ashes were scattered. He was survived by his wife.<br>
