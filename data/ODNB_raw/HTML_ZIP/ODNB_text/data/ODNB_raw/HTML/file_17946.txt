<span class="headword">Mann,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680?, <em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">theological writer</span>, was born in Tewkesbury and was probably the son of John and Margaret Mann who was baptized in Tewkesbury on 2 January 1680. He was admitted a king's scholar at Eton College in April 1695, aged about fourteen, and proceeded to King's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1700. He was elected fellow, at a very young age, in 1702 and graduated BA in 1704 and MA in 1707. At Cambridge he was a companion of the first marquess of Blandford, which led Francis, second earl of Godolphin, to appoint him private tutor to his son William Godolphin, Viscount Railton, later marquess of Blandford and heir to the Marlborough estates. He later became an assistant master at Eton and then one of the clerks in the secretary's office under Lord Townshend. He travelled in France and Italy; by 1722 he was in Florence with his former pupil Richard Rawlinson and William Bromley, and he remained abroad for several years. On his return he was appointed king's waiter at the custom house and keeper of the standing wardrobe at Windsor.<br>
<br>Through the influence of Lord Godolphin, Mann was elected master of the Charterhouse, London, on 19 August 1737, against the opposition of Dr Conyers Middleton. At his institution he is said to have shocked the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Newton, by professing himself an Arian. This is certainly borne out by the views on Christ's divinity expressed in his <span class="italic">Critical notes on some passages of scripture comparing them with the most ancient versions, and restoring them to their original reading, or true sense</span>, published anonymously in 1747, in which he criticizes the Athanasian creed in contrast to the apostles' creed. His treatise drew an immediate response in <span class="italic">The Scripture Testimonies of the Divinity of Jesus Christ Compared</span> (1747), whose author described Mann as one of &#145;the modern Socinians&#146; and accused him of peddling &#145;learned mischief&#146;. Mann's other work was <span class="italic">Of the True Years of the Birth and of the Death of Christ: Two Chronological Dissertations</span> (1733; Latin version, with additions, 1742 and 1752), which he was prompted to write because of the criticisms of Newton's <span class="italic">Chronology</span>. He was also an antiquary and made copious annotations on his copy of Roger Gale's <span class="italic">Antonini iter</span>, which found its way into Richard Gough's possession.<br>
<br>Mann, who does not appear to have been greatly liked at the Charterhouse, did not leave his mark on either the hospital or the school beyond his own epitaph, which was affixed over the chapel door&#151;perhaps prudently&#151;several years before his death at Bath on 24 November 1753. He was buried in the piazza at the Charterhouse and, apparently unmarried, left his property to his sisters, Mary and Margaret Mann, both of whom were still living in Tewkesbury. He bequeathed several items, including a portrait of the late earl of Wilmington, a governor of the hospital, to the Charterhouse, and to Eton College he left his manuscripts, except those of his own works, and his printed books.<br>
