<span class="headword">Newbolt,  William Charles Edmund</span>  (1844&#150;1930), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and theologian</span>, was born on 14 August 1844 at Somerton, Somerset, the fourth and youngest son of the Revd William Robert Newbolt (1801/2&#150;1857), rector of Somerton, and his wife, Ann Frances Dorrien, daughter of Magens Dorrien Magens, of Hammerwood, East Grinstead. As a small boy Newbolt enjoyed &#145;playing at church&#146;  (Newbolt, 14) in the nursery. He attended Somerton grammar school, then a small preparatory school at Weston-super-Mare. In 1857 he went to Uppingham School, Rutland, where the headmaster, Edward Thring (1821&#150;1887), exerted the first significant spiritual influence on his life. In 1863 he went to Pembroke College, Oxford. There he came under the influence of Edward Pusey, Henry Liddon, and Edward King of Cuddesdon, and adopted their Tractarian principles. Never a distinguished scholar, he graduated with a second class in classical moderations (1865) and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1867): BA (1867), MA (1869). He had a further year reading at Oxford but no professional clergy training.<br>
<br>In 1868 Newbolt was ordained deacon and in 1869 priest and for two years (1868&#150;70) worked as a curate in one of the then foremost Tractarian parishes at Wantage, Berkshire, under its vicar, William John Butler (1818&#150;1894). In 1870 he married Fanny Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1923), fourth daughter of William Weld Wren of 27 Gower Street, London; they had one son and two daughters. On his marriage he was nominated as vicar of Dymock, Gloucestershire, by Frederick Lygon, sixth Earl Beauchamp (1830&#150;1891), high-church layman and Conservative politician, and in 1877 Beauchamp nominated him for the parish of Malvern Link, Worcestershire. In both parishes he applied the principles of parochial management he had learned at Wantage.<br>
<br>At Malvern Link Newbolt was in close touch with Worcester. In 1886 the dean of Worcester, Lord Alwyne Compton (1825&#150;1906), became bishop of Ely, and in 1887 invited Newbolt to succeed Dr Herbert Mortimer Luckock (1833&#150;1909) as principal of Ely Theological College. This was for Newbolt the beginning of the most important work of his life. The theological college had been founded in 1876 by Bishop James Russell Woodford (1820&#150;1885) on the pattern of Samuel Wilberforce's college at Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire, and opened in 1881 with the aim of providing for ordinands a spiritual and professional training in accordance with Tractarian ideals of the priestly life. In 1856 and 1857 Dr Henry Parry Liddon (1829&#150;1890) had published in the periodical <span class="italic">Ecclesiastic and Theologian</span> an essay, &#145;The priest in his inner life&#146;, which suggested the lines along which the devotional life of the clergy should be developed, and it was on these lines that Newbolt worked at Ely. He brought to his task the knowledge of and sympathy with human nature gained by his pastoral work, besides the example of his own strong and disciplined character.<br>
<br>On the death in 1890 of Liddon, Lord Salisbury asked Liddon's brother whom he thought Liddon would have wished to succeed him as canon of St Paul's. The answer was &#145;the Principal of Ely&#146;. In that year Newbolt was installed canon of St Paul's, and he held the canonry until his death. St Paul's then held a great place in the religious life of London and England generally&#151;Newbolt wrote, &#145;there was a glamour about St Paul's at this time&#146;  (Newbolt, p. 171)&#151;with Richard William Church (1815&#150;1890), Henry Scott Holland (1847&#150;1918), and Robert Gregory (1819&#150;1911) notable among the clergy, and Sir John Stainer (1840&#150;1901) the organist. Newbolt entered enthusiastically into the spirit and plans of the chapter; he wished to make the cathedral the central church of London, the spiritual home of the metropolis and the empire, where the Anglican liturgy was perfectly rendered throughout the year.<br>
<br>Newbolt was a fluent and facile, but painstaking, preacher. His sermons were carefully prepared; excellently phrased, and delivered with ease and grace; interesting and fresh, and showed wide reading and generous culture. For many years they reached a wide public through the <span class="italic">Church Times</span>. He made no attempt to grapple with the intellectual and social problems of the time; he was content to commend goodness and faithfulness and the Tractarian piety which he had known all his life. He was an unswerving champion of Tractarian orthodoxy, and of views about the inspiration of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Sunday observance which were considered obsolete.<br>
<br>In 1893 Newbolt founded the St Paul's Lecture Society to provide lectures and retreats for the young men employed and living in the surrounding businesses. Later he also founded the Amen Court Guild which had about 400 members and associates: sixty of its members were killed in the First World War, and are commemorated in the crypt of St Paul's.<br>
<br>Arguably Newbolt's greatest achievement was his work for the spiritual life of the clergy. At St Paul's he continued and developed the ministry he had begun at Ely. Every year he conducted retreats for priests and heard their confessions; he published many books of counsel and admonition containing the meditations which he had given in retreat. <span class="italic">Speculum sacerdotum</span> (1893) was the most characteristic and successful of these. He also edited, with Dr Darwell Stone, the <span class="italic">Oxford Library of Practical Theology</span>. Newbolt's theological standpoint changed very little during his long life, remaining true to the ideals of Butler and Liddon. He was so convinced of the excellence of the religious life implied in the prayer book of 1662 that he felt some hesitation in following recent developments which went beyond what the prayer book enjoined. In his prime he was a leading speaker in convocation, and for some years he was returned at the head of the poll as representative of the London diocese clergy in convocation and the church assembly. In 1921 he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Years that are Past</span>.<br>
<br>His final years were overshadowed by his wife's mental illness during her last thirty years. He died on 12 September 1930 in London.<br>
