<span class="headword">O'Donnell,  Hugh  Balldearg</span> <span class="st"> [Aodh  Bailldearg &Oacute; Domhnaill]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1703/4), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in co. Donegal, Ireland, the son of John (Se&aacute;n) O'Donnell (<i>d</i>. 1655), an Irish officer in the Spanish service, and Catherine O'Rourke. His grandfather was Hugh O'Donnell of Ramelton, grandson of Calvagh, who died the head of the O'Donnells in 1566. The chieftaincy passed in Elizabeth's time to a younger branch in the person of Rory O'Donnell, who was granted the earldom of Tyrconnell, and the evidence would appear to suggest that Hugh Albert, the last titular earl, who died childless in 1642, made Hugh Balldearg his testamentary heir, thus restoring the headship of the clan to the elder line. It is suggested that Balldearg inherited the O'Donnell family papers and that although he was not a descendant of the first earl he was descended from the brothers of Sir Niall Garbh O'Donnell. The name Balldearg, which means &#145;red spot&#146;, is derived from a personal peculiarity found in several members of the family.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of O'Donnell's early life, but by the early 1670s he lived in and owned property in Spain. There he was known as Count O'Donnell and earl of Tyrconnell, though he had no legitimate claim to the titles, and commanded an Irish regiment of horse in the Spanish army with the rank of colonel. In 1689 he was refused leave to go to Ireland, where he wished to serve James II, and in the process recover his Irish title and estates. Instead, he went secretly to Lisbon, where he published a manifesto, and put himself in contact with the French ambassador.<br>
<br>O'Donnell eventually reached Cork in July 1690, four days after the battle of the Boyne, and visited the fugitive king on board ship at Kinsale harbour. After James recommended him to Richard Talbot, the then earl of Tyrconnell, O'Donnell was given a commission to raise 3000&#150;4000 men. By the magic of his name, and with the help of an old prophecy that Ireland should be saved by an O'Donnell with a red spot, he raised fourteen regiments in the north, and sent a memorandum to the French ambassador to the effect that he could easily raise 30,000 if arms and ammunition were provided. According to the earl of Melfort &#145;the very friars and some of the bishops had taken arms to follow him&#146;  (O'Kelly, 469). But despite granting commissions to members of the leading Old Irish families in Ulster and Connaught the regiments under O'Donnell's command were never completely taken into service. Jealousies between the Old English Catholics and Old Irish were rife, as personified in the dispute between Tyrconnell and O'Donnell which prevented the latter from taking an active part in the 1691 campaign. Moreover, Fumeron, the intendant with the French troops and faithful servant of Louis XIV, looked upon Balldearg as a doubtful ally.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with the treatment meted out to him and by the losses at Athlone, Aughrim, and Galway, by mid-1691 O'Donnell had proposed to the Williamite General Godert van Ginckell that he would serve in the Williamite army on condition that he would be granted the earldom of Tyrconnell and &pound;2000 for his expenses. These negotiations were later published, much to O'Donnell's distress, in an August edition of the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span>. By September, after some further feints, he openly joined the Williamites before Sligo with 1000 men. Although Ginckell remained suspicious of Balldearg, he certainly contributed to the fall of the town. On 7 October the two met once again and terms were arranged, but few of O'Donnell's men followed him. A pension of &pound;500 a year was settled on him for life, but an intention to employ him in Ireland was abandoned in deference to the protestant interest.<br>
<br>O'Donnell's appearance at Kensington Palace in London in December 1691 created enormous interest and it was reported that &#145;he is still respected by the Irish, and has the manners and character of a Spaniard, and he will return to Spain if he can&#146;  (Mulloy, 2, no. 1751). In 1693, after recovering from a long illness, he left England for the Spanish Netherlands before moving to Piedmont, where he was given command of a regiment of foot. Balldearg and his regiment were in Catalonia by 1695, but saw little military action. With the treaty of Ryswick in 1697 he moved to the Spanish court, was made a major-general in the Spanish army, and was sent to serve in Flanders. His place of death is unknown but it is believed that O'Donnell died in 1703 or 1704.<br>
<br>Irish writers generally have dealt hardly with O'Donnell's memory, but John O'Donovan wrote in his defence in 1860, and modern writers are more favourable towards him. It is now acknowledged that he was consistent in his loyalties&#151;to his Roman Catholic faith and to Spain.<br>
