<span class="headword">Crew,  Francis Albert Eley <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1886&#150;1973), <span class="occ">animal geneticist</span>, was born on 2 March 1886 at 227 Dudley Port, Tipton, Staffordshire, on the outskirts of Birmingham. His father, Thomas Crew, was a small grocer who later prospered in business. Both his father and his mother, Annie (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Eley), were devout nonconformists. Crew was the third of their five children but the only one to survive beyond infancy. He was educated at the King Edward VI School in Birmingham from 1896 to 1906. From an early age Crew was passionately interested in pets, and he bred bantams very successfully, winning prizes at local shows. Believing a medical qualification to be the gateway to biological research, from 1907 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MB ChB in 1912. In the following year Crew married Helen Campbell Dykes (<i>c</i>.1886&#150;1971), a fellow medical student in Edinburgh. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>During the First World War Crew served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, reaching the rank of major in 1917. After the war he returned to Edinburgh and obtained the post of assistant in the department of natural history, where he taught genetics. His flair for teaching was described by his colleague and close friend Lancelot Hogben:<blockquote>In the lecture theatre he was a spell binder. Handsome, well built, equipped with a mellifluous voice and a ready but rarely uncharitable wit, he had histrionic talent worthy of a Shakespearean actor and&#151;how rare a combination&#151;an irreproachably lucid gift of exposition. (Hogben, 136)</blockquote>In 1920 Crew was appointed as the first director of the Institute of Animal Breeding, then being set up in Edinburgh. Although it was linked to the department of animal breeding, the department existed only in name (and had neither staff, nor accommodation). By persuasive begging he obtained funds for a new building and for the endowment of a new chair, staff, and funds for research. In 1928 he was appointed to the new Buchanan chair of animal genetics.<br>
<br>Under Crew's leadership the institute did pioneering work on sex determination, reproductive physiology, and many aspects of the husbandry and breeding of sheep, cattle, pigs, horses, and poultry, and on the genetics of mice and budgerigars' colours. Crew's own most notable work centred on sex determination and sexual abnormalities such as sex reversal and intersexes in birds and mammals. This work, which was described in his book <span class="italic">Sex Determination</span> (1933), led to an understanding of how secondary sexual characters (such as the feathering of fowls) are determined during development.<br>
<br>The Seventh International Congress of Genetics was held in Edinburgh from 23 to 30 August 1939, when the Second World War was imminent. In the absence of the president-elect, the Russian N. Vavilov, Crew was chosen to be president in his place. This congress was the culmination of Crew's career in genetics.<br>
<br>Crew's influence on genetics was not so much through his own research, but through his infectious enthusiasm which attracted many able biologists to the subject, and through his success in obtaining funds. Crew's successor in the Buchanan chair, C. H. Waddington, described his influence on genetics as &#145;an achievement on a heroic scale&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). During the Second World War, Crew served in the War Office as director of biological research, with the rank of brigadier. He was charged with producing the official <span class="italic">Army Medical History of the War</span>, much of which he wrote himself. It was published between 1953 and 1966 in five volumes. Crew resigned from the Buchanan chair in 1944 and was appointed in 1945 to the chair of public health and social medicine in Edinburgh. During his tenure of this chair he laid the foundations of medical genetics. His book <span class="italic">The Measurement of Public Health</span> (1948) outlines his teaching in the department. After retiring in 1955 he went on missions to Egypt, Burma, and twice to India, teaching and advising on medical genetics. After the last of these journeys, in 1967, he settled at Upton Mill, Framfield, Sussex.<br>
<br>Crew was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1939, and he received many other marks of distinction and honours. In 1972, following the death of his first wife, he married Margaret Whithof-Keus, a medical graduate and friend who had given him much help and support in his later work. Crew died on 26 May 1973.<br>
