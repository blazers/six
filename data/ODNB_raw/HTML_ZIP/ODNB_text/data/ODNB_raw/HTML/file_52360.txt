<span class="headword">Picot</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1071<span class="mult">x</span>5&#150;1092), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was a leading servant of William the Conqueror. Little is known about his background or family: even the chronicler of Barnwell Priory, a house of Augustinian canons that owed its origins to Picot, knew only that he was a Norman and that his wife's name was Hugoline. None the less, <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> and a number of the Conqueror's writs make it clear that Picot prospered mightily under William, primarily because of his position as sheriff of Cambridgeshire. He was made sheriff some time before 1075, possibly as early as 1071, when Hereward the Wake's rebellion, centred on the Isle of Ely, was suppressed.<br>
<br>At the time of the Domesday inquest in 1086, Picot held just over &pound;140 worth of land. Almost all of it was in Cambridgeshire, although he did have some interests in Essex and Suffolk. He seems to have acquired his lands in four ways. First, he came into the holdings of the sheriff of Cambridgeshire of Edward the Confessor's time. Second, he held the land of dozens of English sokemen, and it looks as if he drove lesser men into his lordship, offering them protection in return for considerable rights over their lands. Third, Picot, who was probably in charge of the Conqueror's castle in the borough of Cambridge, ruthlessly exploited the burgesses there. Finally, at an inquest held between 1072 and 1075, he was found holding land that belonged by right to Ely Abbey. As a compromise, the king ordered Picot to retain the land he had taken, but as a tenant of the abbot. A decade later, however, Picot and the abbot were still arguing over rights to Ely's patrimony. In the <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, a history of Ely Abbey compiled in the twelfth century, Picot was remembered as &#145;a hungry lion, a prowling wolf, a crafty fox, a filthy pig, a shameless dog&#146;, who, when told he was stealing land from Ely's patron saint, &AElig;thelthryth, replied, &#145;&AElig;thelthryth? Who is this &AElig;thelthryth of whom you speak?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span>, 211). Picot's predation was not limited to Ely: he was also holding land that had once belonged to Crowland Abbey and he suborned the testimony of local jurors in a famous lawsuit against Gundulf, bishop of Rochester.<br>
<br>During the Conqueror's reign Picot did much to establish himself within local society. He married Hugoline, the daughter of an important Norman neighbour, Robert Gernon. He became the tenant of some of the most important lords in the region&#151;Count Alan of Richmond, Remigius, bishop of Lincoln, Guy de Raimbeaucourt, Peter de Valognes, William fitz Ansculf, and Countess Judith&#151;and two tenants-in-chief, Guy de Raimbeaucourt and Robert Fafiton, also held land from him. Picot, moreover, settled a dozen of his own followers as tenants on his estates, including his son-in-law Ralph de St Germains and his brother Roger. He also built a castle at Bourn, near Ermine Street, some 10 miles west of Cambridge. Probably in 1092 he and his wife founded a house of canons in Cambridge at the church of St Giles, which formed the core of the endowment of Barnwell Priory. The community was made up of six canons, and put under the charge of Geoffrey, a canon from St Mary's, Huntingdon, a foundation of the sheriff Eustace, which perhaps points to another of Picot's friendships.<br>
<br>Picot continued as sheriff under William Rufus, but his son Robert rebelled against Henry I and was disinherited and exiled. The date of Picot's death is unknown; he was probably buried at the church of St Giles, Cambridge. Paine Peverel was given Picot's estates and took over the patronage of his foundation, both of which then descended to the Pecche family.<br>
