<span class="headword">Tooke,  Thomas</span>  (1774&#150;1858), <span class="occ">economist</span>, born at Kronstadt, Russia, on 28 February 1774, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27547/', "William Tooke (bap. 1744, d. 1820)")</script>, then chaplain to the British factory at Kronstadt, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Eyton. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27548/', "William Tooke")</script> was his younger brother. Thomas began working at the age of fifteen in a house of business at St Petersburg, and subsequently became a partner in the London firms of Stephen Thornton &amp; Co. and Astell, Tooke, and Thornton. On 8 September 1802 he married Priscilla (<i>d</i>. 1837), daughter of Charles Combe MD of Bloomsbury, London.<br>
<br>Tooke apparently did not take part in any public discussion of economic questions until 1819, in which year he gave evidence before committees of both houses of parliament on the resumption of cash payments by the Bank of England. He began his career as an economist as a supporter of the principles embodied in the report of the bullion committee of 1810. Those principles, advocated by Ricardo, Horner, Thornton, and Huskisson, were to become the basis of the bullionist position and were later adopted by the currency school. Tooke's approach to monetary issues changed later in his career, and in the 1840s he became a leading figure in the famous banking school.<br>
<br>During the three years which followed the <span class="roman">Resumption Act</span> of 1819 prices of nearly all commodities decreased, and the opinion that the fall in prices was the result of the return to cash payments gained support. Tooke's efforts during his early years as an active economist were devoted to the defence of the resumption and the refutation of the claims that it was responsible for the decline in prices and associated crises. In his first book, published in 1823, <span class="italic">Thoughts and Details on the High and Low Prices of the Last Thirty Years</span>, he presented data to support his point of view. He pursued the argument in his <span class="italic">Considerations on the State of the Currency</span> (1826), which also included an innovative discussion of interest rates, and in his <span class="italic">Letter to Lord Grenville</span> (1829), followed by another letter addressed to Grenville in that year, <span class="italic">On the Currency in Connection with the Corn Trade</span>. His object was to negate &#145;the alleged influence of the bank restriction and resumption in raising or depressing general prices beyond the difference between gold and paper&#146;, and to show that the act of 1819 was practically inoperative so far as any contraction of the currency was concerned. This line of research led to a detailed examination of the causes which might affect prices, and Tooke claimed to establish the conclusion that the variations, both during the period of restriction and after the resumption, were due to &#145;real&#146; causes, directly connected with the commodities themselves, and not to monetary factors.<br>
<br>The same views were maintained in the first two volumes of the <span class="italic">History of Prices</span>, dealing with the period from 1793 to 1837, which were published in 1838. His conclusions as regards that period were that the high prices which, generally speaking, ruled between 1793 and 1814 were due to a relatively large number of unfavourable seasons, coupled with the obstructions to trade which were created by the Napoleonic wars; while the lower range of prices in the subsequent years was attributable to a series of more prolific seasons, the removal of the adverse influences arising out of a state of war, and the consequent improvement in the processes of manufacture and industry.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">History of Prices</span> was completed in six volumes; the third, dealing with the years 1838&#150;9, was published in 1840 and contained already some of the formulations of Tooke's transition into a banking school's position. The fourth volume was published in 1848, and the fifth and sixth, in the compilation of which Tooke was assisted by William Newmarch, in 1857, the year before Tooke's death.<br>
<br>The whole work is an admirable analysis of the financial and commercial history of the period which it covers; and the subject was one with which Tooke was peculiarly well fitted to deal, possessing as he did the rather rare combination of a wide practical knowledge of mercantile affairs with considerable powers of reflection and reasoning. Whatever may be thought of his conclusions, the value of his methods of investigation is beyond dispute.<br>
<br>The chief interest of the later volumes lies in their record of the steps by which Tooke gradually severed himself from the supporters of the currency theory, who may be regarded as the direct heirs of the bullionists of 1810 and 1819. There is a general agreement that Tooke's early publications, before 1840, reflect an approach to monetary issues quite different from that which characterizes his later works. Tooke's 1844 pamphlet, <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Currency Principle</span>, marked a complete departure from the monetary views of his first period. These new views constituted a theoretical declaration of the principles of the banking school. In brief, he now argued that there was no theoretical or empirical basis for the currency school's distinction between banknotes and other means of payment, such as cheques and bills of exchange. Secondly, he argued that the quantity theory of money, which stated that prices were determined by the quantity of the medium in circulation, was wrong. Tooke and the banking school thought that, on the contrary, the quantity of the medium in circulation was determined by prices. Prices, he contended, were determined by the incomes of the consumers.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Resumption Act</span> passed in 1819 was a practical recognition of the instability associated with an inconvertible paper currency. But it did not take long to convince policy makers that the measure was incomplete. The experience of the great crisis of 1825, followed by those of 1836&#150;9, showed that it was not enough to impose on the Bank of England the liability of payment in gold unless there was also security that the bank had the means of discharging the liability. Both in 1825 and in 1839 the danger of another suspension of cash payments was imminent. But while all agreed that the management of the currency, so far as it rested with the bank, was unsatisfactory, there was great difference of opinion as to the remedy which should be applied.<br>
<br>Out of the controversy emerged the act of 1844, the main object of which was to prevent the over-issue of notes and to regulate their quantity so that the volume of the currency should at all times conform in amount to what it would have been under a purely metallic system. Thus, the <span class="roman">Bank Act</span>, which separated the issuing of notes from other banking activities, implemented the currency school's analysis.<br>
<br>Tooke was resolutely opposed to the provisions of the act, holding them to be either superfluous or mischievous. He did not dispute that the affairs of the bank had been mismanaged; but he attributed this less to the system than to want of prudence in administering it. He thought that by some changes in the management of the bank, coupled with the compulsory maintenance of a much larger reserve of bullion, more satisfactory results would be achieved than under the inelastic system prescribed by the act.<br>
<br>The supporters of the &#145;currency theory&#146;, whose principles were adopted by Peel and embodied in the act, were represented by Samuel Jones Loyd, Baron Overstone, Robert Torrens, and George Warde Norman. They contended that banks of issue, by the arbitrary extension of their circulation, could produce a direct effect upon prices, and thus stimulate speculation, with the consequent fluctuations and revulsions of credit; that the mere enactment of convertibility on demand was not a sufficient safeguard against these evils; and that the only adequate remedy was to separate the business of issue from that of banking in such a way that the former should regulate itself automatically, and that the discretion of the directors should be confined to the latter alone.<br>
<br>Tooke, on the other hand, reinforced later on by John Fullarton and James Wilson, maintained from 1844 that a paper currency which was readily convertible on demand must necessarily conform, so far as its permanent value was concerned, to the value of a purely metallic currency; that for this purpose no other regulation was required beyond ready and immediate convertibility; that under these conditions banks had no power of arbitrarily increasing their issues; and that the level of prices was not directly affected by such issues.<br>
<br>Tooke's views on the application of free-trade principles to note-issuing were the last to change during his transition from a &#145;moderate bullionist&#146; to a banking school advocate. Whereas in his early conceptualization he totally rejected the application of <i>laissez-faire</i> to note-issuing, in 1844 he came to the conclusion that, in fact, competition, under certain restrictions, might work.<br>
<br>In Tooke's earlier writings there were many passages inconsistent with his later opinions; and the process of development was very gradual (see J. Fullarton, <span class="italic">On the Regulation of Currencies</span>, 2nd edn, 1845, 18). Overstone also observed before the 1857 select committee on the <span class="roman">Bank Acts</span> that &#145;Mr. Tooke is upon this subject of science very like our great artist Mr. Turner upon the subject of art: he has his later manner as well as his middle manner.&#146;<br>
<br>Tooke was one of the earliest supporters of the free-trade movement, which first assumed a definite form in the petition of the merchants of the City of London presented to the House of Commons by Alexander Baring (later Baron Ashburton) on 8 May 1820. This document, which contains an admirable statement of the principles of free trade, was drawn up by Tooke; and the circumstances which led to its preparation are described in the sixth volume of the <span class="italic">History of Prices</span>. The substantial advances in the direction of free trade made by Lord Liverpool's government, especially after the accession of William Huskisson in 1828, were no doubt largely due to the effect produced by the petition; and it may fairly be claimed for it that it gave the first impulse towards that revision of commercial policy which was the work of the next half-century.<br>
<br>It was to support the principles of the merchants' petition that Tooke, with Ricardo, Malthus, James Mill, and others, founded the Political Economy Club in April 1821. From the beginning he took a prominent part in its discussions, and he continued to attend its meetings until within a few weeks of his death, his last recorded attendance being on 3 December 1857.<br>
<br>Besides giving evidence on economic questions before several parliamentary committees, such as those of 1819 on the resumption of cash payments, of 1821 on agricultural depression and on foreign trade, and of 1832, 1840, 1841, and 1848 on the <span class="roman">Bank Acts</span>, Tooke was the chief commissioner of the children's employment commission and a prominent member of the factories inquiry commission of 1833. He retired from active business on his own account in 1836, but was governor of the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation from 1840 to 1852, and was also chairman of the St Katharine's Dock Company.<br>
<br>Tooke was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in March 1821, and a corresponding member of the Institut de France (Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques) in February 1853. He lived in London at 12 Russell Square, afterwards in Richmond Terrace, and at 31 Spring Gardens, where he died on 26 February 1858. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. His second son survived him, two other sons having predeceased him.<br>
<br>In the year after Tooke's death the Tooke professorship of economic science and statistics at King's College, London, was founded in his memory, the endowment being raised by public subscription.<br>
