<span class="headword">Hooke,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1763), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13689/', "John Hooke (1655&#150;1712)")</script>, serjeant-at-law, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lambert (<i>d</i>. 1736). He was the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13691/', "Nathaniel Hooke")</script>. The younger Nathaniel is thought by the antiquary John Kirk to have studied with Alexander Pope at Twyford School, near Winchester, and formed a lifelong friendship with the poet. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 6 February 1702. Writing to the earl of Oxford on 17 October 1722, Hooke spoke of how &#145;the late epidemical distemper&#146; (that is, interest in the stocks of the South Sea Company) had &#145;seized him&#146;, and that &#145;he was in some measure happy to find himself at that instant just worth nothing&#146;. In the letter Hooke sought employment and also permission to dedicate to Oxford his <span class="italic">Life of F&eacute;nelon</span> (1723), a translation from the French of the work by Andrew Michael Ramsay. The permission was granted, and from 1723 until his death Hooke enjoyed the confidence and patronage of many distinguished men, including Oxford, the earl of Marchmont, Arthur Onslow, speaker in the House of Commons, Pope, the physician George Cheyne, and Dr King, principal of St Mary Hall, Oxford. In 1741 Hooke was recommended by Lord Chesterfield to Sarah, dowager duchess of Marlborough, as someone able to assist her in the publication of her memoirs. The elderly duchess recounted a narrative of her time at court which Hooke wrote up and published in book form in 1742. During the book's compilation Hooke lived with the duchess and the two developed a friendship. As Pope told Lady Marlborough, Hooke's respect for his employer was of &#145;such a degree that I doubt whether he can be Impartial enough to be your Historian&#146;  (Harris, 332). For his work on her memoirs Hooke received &pound;5000 from the duchess. During Hooke's residence with her Lady Marlborough commissioned him to negotiate with Pope for the suppression, in consideration of the payment of &pound;3000, of the character of &#145;Atossa&#146; in his <span class="italic">Epistles</span>. Hooke's Catholicism created tension in his relationship with the resolutely agnostic duchess. Finally, in 1743, Hooke's religious convictions became too irksome and the duchess ended their friendship. Hooke also brought a Roman Catholic ecclesiastic to take Pope's confession on his deathbed, angering Lord Bolingbroke who flew into a great passion on learning what had happened.<br>
<br>Bishop Warburton described Hooke as &#145;a mystic and quietist, and a warm disciple of F&eacute;nelon&#146;, Samuel Johnson observed that he &#145;was a virtuous man, as his history shows&#146;, and Pope suggested that Hooke and Conyers Middleton were the only two contemporary prose writers whose works were worth consulting by an English lexicographer. Other works by Hooke include <span class="italic">The Roman History, from the Building of Rome to the Ruin of the Commonwealth</span> (4 vols., 1738&#150;71), a highly regarded study, reprinted in 1830; <span class="italic">Travels of Cyrus, with a Discourse on Mythology</span> (1739), translated by Hooke in twenty days while at Bath; <span class="italic">Observations</span> (1758), dedicated to Speaker Onslow, and &#145;Six Letters to a Lady of Quality&#146;, first published in <span class="italic">The contrast, or, An antidote against the pernicious principles disseminated in the letters of the late earl of Chesterfield</span> (1791). With his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gore, Hook had three children. At his death at Cookham, Berkshire, on 19 July 1763 he was survived by two sons, Thomas, a Church of England clergyman, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13690/', "Luke Joseph Hooke")</script>. His daughter, Jane Mary, died in April 1793 and was buried at Hedsor churchyard in Buckinghamshire where her father had also been buried thirty years earlier.<br>
