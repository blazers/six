<span class="headword">Lake,  Edward</span>  (1641&#150;1704), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Exeter on 10 November 1641, the son of James Lake (1612/13&#150;1678), rector of St Pancras in that city, later vicar of Veryan, Cornwall (1642&#150;61), and canon of Exeter Cathedral (1660&#150;78). Edward Lake matriculated (as Andrew Lake) from Wadham College, Oxford, on 31 July 1658 as a commoner and was elected a scholar of his college on 23 September 1659, but moved to Cambridge before graduating; however, there is no record of his college or graduation at Cambridge. In his early career he seems to have been connected to the family of John Grenville, first earl of Bath. He was made rector of Norton, Kent, in 1669, a living that he held until 1683.<br>
<br>About 1670 Lake became chaplain and tutor to the princesses Mary and Anne, daughters of James, duke of York. Lake's published diary for 1677&#150;8 gives details of Mary's marriage to William of Orange and of the appointment of William Sancroft as archbishop of Canterbury (an appointment that surprised Lake, given Sancroft's then relatively lowly position as dean of St Paul's). When Princess Anne was taken ill with smallpox, the duke of York forbade Lake from attending her. Lake suspected that this was not to prevent the spread of the disease, but so that Anne's Catholic nurse could exert a greater influence over her. When Lake took his concerns to Henry Compton, bishop of London, the bishop contradicted James's orders and insisted that Lake minister to the princess.<br>
<br>Lake was disappointed in his hope of accompanying Princess Mary to Holland but nevertheless, despite this friction, went on to serve as chaplain to the duke of York in what seems to have been an effective and cordial working relationship, accompanying him to Scotland in 1679 and, while there, interviewing the Cameronian rebels in prison. Lake was appointed a prebendary of Exeter on 13 December 1675 and archdeacon of Exeter on 24 October 1676. That same year he was created DD at Cambridge by royal mandate. On 5 January 1681 he was elected a brother of St Katharine's Hospital (a charitable foundation attached to St Katharine by the Tower), of which he was also a commissary. (He resigned his patent for this last office on 10 November 1698.) On 30 November 1682 he was instituted to the rectory of St Mary-at-Hill, London, to which was annexed in 1700 that of St Andrew Hubbard.<br>
<br>Lake is best known as the author of <span class="italic">Officium eucharisticum</span> (1673), a devotional manual which was designed for his royal pupils but which became very popular and went through more than thirty editions. Later versions of the work featured additions that some felt smacked of Catholicism, but these alterations do not appear to have been the work of the author. He was also a popular preacher, delivering a sermon in 1684 to the lord mayor of London on the political dangers of all types of puritanism. As evidence he related his experience of the covenanter rebels while in Scotland in the service of the duke. Despite his closeness to James II, Lake appears to have had no problems in giving his allegiance to William III in 1689. Indeed, he seems to have been overtly hostile to some nonjurors, Sancroft accusing him of spreading malicious rumours about him in 1690.<br>
<br>With his wife, Margaret (1638&#150;1712), Lake had three daughters who survived him, Mary, Ann, and Frances, who married William Taswell DD on 21 May 1695 at St Mary-at-Hill. Taswell later published a collection of sixteen of Lake's sermons. Lake died on 1 February 1704, probably in the parish of St Mary-at-Hill, and was buried at St Katharine by the Tower, London. The inscription on his monument in the church shows that his friends thought he had been inadequately rewarded for his efforts. An engraved portrait of Lake was made by M. Van der Gucht and is reproduced in some copies of Lake's <span class="italic">Officium eucharisticum</span>.<br>
