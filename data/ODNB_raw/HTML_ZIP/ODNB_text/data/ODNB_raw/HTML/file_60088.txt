<span class="headword">Edwards,  Joseph</span>  (1814&#150;1882), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 5 March 1814 at Ynysgau, Merthyr Tudful, Glamorgan, the son of John Edwards, a stonecutter. Joseph assisted his father in his business, showing exceptional ability from an early age. He had a limited education at local charity schools. At seventeen Joseph sought to widen his horizons by walking through south and west Wales, spending nearly two years in Swansea where he was employed as a mason. At twenty-one, in 1835, he went to London carrying an introduction to the sculptor William Behnes who, after some hesitation, employed him. He stayed with Behnes until 1838, during which time he attended the Royal Academy Schools, winning the silver medal for best model from the antique, and exhibiting for the first time. He entered the studio of Patrick Macdowell while continuing his studies at the Royal Academy, where he won a second silver medal in 1839. By this time he was gaining commissions for portrait busts and memorials in his own right, especially from patrons connected with south Wales. He carved the monument to Henry Charles Somerset, sixth duke of Beaufort, and in 1840 he made a bust of Ivor Bertie Guest, the first of several commissions from Merthyr industrialists.<br>
<br>In 1843 Edwards carved <span class="italic">The Last Dream</span> (exh. RA, 1844, as &#145;Part of a monument at North Othrington church to the late Miss Hutton of Sowber Hill, North Allerton&#146;; North Otterington church, Yorkshire), regarded as his early masterpiece, and John Gibson interested himself in his compatriot's work on a visit to London. Welsh intellectuals became increasingly aware of his career. Edwards was perceived to demonstrate the potential for national progress in Wales, having risen by his own efforts from humble origins to find a place in the English art world. Like Gibson, he was frequently cited in the mid-nineteenth century as an example for the young to follow. In 1855, at the Royal London Eisteddfod, he became the first Welsh artist to have a solo exhibition of his works, and in the 1860s and 1870s he moved among the London Welsh intelligentsia who exercised a strong influence on national development.<br>
<br>Edwards was patronized by notable establishment figures. His marble relief <span class="italic">Religion Consoling Justice</span> (1853; Dingestow, Monmouthshire) formed part of the memorial to Justice Sir John Bernard Bosanquet, and in 1854 and 1856 he was again commissioned by the Beaufort family. In 1859 he met George Virtue, whose magazine, the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, promoted his work, publishing engravings on several occasions. Virtue also made use of a work by Edwards for the headpiece of his <span class="italic">Girls Own Paper</span>. In 1870 the sculptor was commissioned to execute the memorial to the publisher at Walton-on-Thames cemetery.<br>
<br>Edwards was both a meticulous craftsman and painstaking in his artistic conceptions, which were of a mystical though fundamentally Christian nature. His <span class="italic">Religion</span>, exhibited as a plaster at the International Exhibition of 1862, became his only large-scale public sculpture in his native country, erected in marble at Cefncoedycymer cemetery ten years later (a second version is at Highgate cemetery, London). His high seriousness and dedication to art came at the expense of business considerations and he was frequently financially embarrassed. Probably for this reason, in 1846 Edwards began to work for Matthew Noble in a role which, it is clear, far exceeded that of the normal assistant. Among Edwards's papers is a list of some forty major pieces attributed to the English sculptor on which he worked at every stage from conception to completion, including the famous Wellington memorial of 1856 in Manchester. He became known in the art world as Noble's &#145;ghost&#146;, entering his studio at the end of the day to work overnight, and on Sundays. On Noble's death in 1876, Edwards completed his outstanding works, for which he received minimal recompense. In 1881 Thomas Woolner, who took a dim view of Noble's practice, made application on Edwards's behalf for a Turner bequest. The Welsh sculptor was able to benefit from only one payment, since he died, unmarried, on 9 January 1882 at his home, 40 Roberts Street, Hampstead Road, London. He was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
