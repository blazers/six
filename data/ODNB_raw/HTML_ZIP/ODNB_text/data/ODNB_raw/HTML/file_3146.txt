<span class="headword">Boys, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1607, <em>d.</em> 1664), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was baptized at Chillenden parish church, Kent, on 5 April 1607, second of the six children of Edward Boys (<i>d</i>. 1661) of Goodnestone-next-Wingham, Kent, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Edward Saunders of Northbourn in Kent. It does not appear that John Boys attended university. As eldest son he was heir to the estate at Bonnington in Goodnestone, the main seat of his family since at least the mid-fourteenth century. At the age of twenty-one Boys was indicted for the manslaughter in Canterbury of a vagrant, Thomas Alcock, by &#145;a blow on the head with a fire pan&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1629&#150;31</i>, 336) but he was pardoned in November 1630. Three years later, on 8 March 1634, he married Lucy (<i>d</i>. in or before 1650), daughter of John Denne of St Stephen's near Canterbury; they had five daughters.<br>
<br>Before the civil war Boys spent &#145;divers years as a soldier abroad&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 18891, fol. 15), probably in Ireland. He was a captain in the army raised by Charles I against the Scots in 1640; in February 1642 he was at Chester recruiting for the Irish army to oppose the Catholic Confederate rebels and by November, with civil war in England, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the royalist foot regiment of John Savage, second Earl Rivers. In September 1643, in the aftermath of the first battle of Newbury, Boys was appointed governor of nearby Donnington Castle. It had a strong barbican tower but otherwise only a modest curtain wall described by William Camden as &#145;windows on all sides, very lightsome&#146;  (Money, 135). The castle had strategic significance in controlling the London to Bath road and waspositioned between the royalist headquarters at Oxford and the parliamentarians in London; Boys constructed earthworks around it before defending it from two assaults during the summer of 1644. Knighted by Charles I in the days before the second battle of Newbury in October 1644, Boys was made colonel and repulsed a further attack on the castle. During the subsequent winter parliament raised money for a final siege and Boys surrendered Donnington on 1 April 1646 only after John Dalbier's troops blasted it with a 15 inch &#145;mortar-piece&#146;  (Money, 207).<br>
<br>In September 1646 Boys was in the Netherlands but he was back at Bonnington in November. Now basing himself in Kent, he played the leading role in the county uprising of 1648 which followed the attempt of parliament to ban the traditional celebration of Christmas. He was among those framing a country petition in May with its threat of armed resistance, and following the subjugation of Maidstone and Canterbury by parliamentarian forces in June Boys escaped to the Netherlands. Late in July he sailed with Prince Charles for Yarmouth, but plans to raise Norfolk for the king and relieve Colchester came to nothing. A fortnight later Boys attempted to raise Kent at Deal but in the skirmish that ensued he was shot. &#145;The buckle of his hanger gave some stop to the bullet&#146; and he was captured  (<span class="italic">Packets of Letters</span>, 7). Boys escaped with sequestration and made composition of his fines in April 1649. Following the death of his first wife he married Ann Brockman on 12 December 1650 at Newington-next-Hythe, Kent; after her death about 1653 he married Elizabeth, Lady Finch (<i>d</i>. 1672?), daughter of Sir John Fotherby of Barham, Kent, and widow of Sir Nathaniel Finch.<br>
<br>Boys was arrested and imprisoned in the spring of 1651 and again in February 1655 with a few close colleagues on suspicion of planning military insurrection. In 1658 Boys was listed in succession to Rivers as colonel in the Kent royalist army and was supplying money to Charles Stuart in Brussels. By June 1659 it was the opinion of Sir Edward Hyde that Boys was &#145;as fit a person to be Major General &hellip; as any man; and, if I am not deceived, is well beloved generally in the country&#146;  (Newman, 39) and that summer he received a royal commission &#145;to treat with subjects formerly in rebellion&#146; in Kent  (Everitt, 303). In January 1660 with his aged father and others Boys &#145;designed and propounded&#146; a county petition that called for free elections and he was briefly reimprisoned in Dover Castle  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, 26 Jan&#150;2 Feb 1660, 1068); thereafter he was one of those who plied the English Channel carrying correspondence between Edward Montagu, first earl of Sandwich, and Charles.<br>
<br>With the dissolution of the Rump Parliament in February there was a final republican effort to divide opinion in Kent but Boys and others issued a counter-declaration on 20 April on behalf of the gentry &#145;who adhered to the King&#146; which rejected any &#145;revengeful thoughts and actions&#146;  (Everitt, 312&#150;13). The following day Boys dined with Montagu's follower Samuel Pepys along with &#145;some other gentlemen, formerly great Cavaliers&#146;. To Pepys he &#145;seemed a fine man&#146; and they met again at sea in mid-May, Boys on his way back from the Brill and still closely involved in the preparations that culminated two weeks later in the restoration of Charles II  (Pepys, 1.112, 106).<br>
<br>In July 1660 Boys was rewarded with the customership of Dover and in April 1662 he was appointed deputy governor of Duncannon Fort, co. Wexford. He died at Ross, co. Wexford, on 8 October 1664, having been on active service in Ireland during 1663&#150;4, and was buried in Goodnestone church. Boys was survived by his third wife, Elizabeth, and three of his daughters who, in 1666, sold the Bonnington estate to Thomas Brome.<br>
