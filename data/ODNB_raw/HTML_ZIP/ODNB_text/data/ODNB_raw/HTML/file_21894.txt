<span class="headword">Penry,  John</span>  (1562/3&#150;1593), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was born in Brecknockshire, the son of Meredith Penry of Llangamarch. He may have attended the grammar school in Brecon before he entered Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 11 June 1580. He graduated BA in 1584 and then withdrew from his college for just over a year, spending part of this time in Wales. He went back to Cambridge in October 1585, but in the following June migrated to Oxford and took the degree of MA from St Alban Hall in July 1586. Probably already in close contact with the most forward protestants in Oxford, Penry refused to seek ordination in what he considered to be an insufficiently reformed church, though he preached in both universities and also in Northampton, where as early as 1587 Richard Bancroft believed he had become a member of the classis.<br>
<br>Immediately after he had obtained his master's degree Penry turned his attention to the state of the church in his native land, and in 1586 compiled <span class="italic">A treatise containing the aequity of an humble supplication which is to be exhibited unto hir gracious maiesty and this high court of parliament in the behalfe of the countrey of Wales, that some order may be taken for the preaching of the gospell among those people</span>. Having heard that parliament might be dissolved, early in 1587 Penry gained a licence for his tract, had 500 copies printed in Oxford, and brought them hurriedly to London. On 28 February he persuaded Edward Dounlee, the member for Carmarthen, to present <span class="italic">The Aequity</span> to the House of Commons, where it gained the enthusiastic support of the Warwickshire MP, Job Throckmorton. However, Archbishop Whitgift was indignant that parliament should be interfering in matters of religion, and even before the session had ended issued warrants for the seizure of the book and its author. Penry appeared before the high commission in March 1587 on a charge of having published treason and heresy, and was pronounced guilty and imprisoned in the Gatehouse for a month.<br>
<br>Determined not to abandon his mission to rescue his countrymen from their ignorance and blindness, Penry at once set to work on another publication. Since he now stood no chance of procuring an episcopal licence, he needed access to a secret press, and it seems that a Cambridge friend, John Udall, introduced him to the printer Robert Waldegrave, who in April 1588, at his printing house in the Strand, published <span class="italic">An exhortation unto the governours and people of her maiesties countrie of Wales, to labor earnestly to have the preaching of the gospell planted among them</span>. During the course of the year Waldegrave brought out two more editions of this much longer work, which denounced the bishops as soul murderers for their neglect of the people of Wales.<br>
<br>Penry had just taken the stock of his second book from Waldegrave's house when it was raided on 16 April 1588. The printer and his wife removed what type they could salvage to Elizabeth Crane's house in Aldermanbury and then, after Penry had procured a new press, resumed printing at Mrs Crane's country estate at East Molesey. The press was still in Surrey when in August 1588 Waldegrave published <span class="italic">A defence of that which hath bin written in the questions of the ignorant ministerie, and the communicating with them</span>, Penry's interim reply to <span class="italic">A Godly Treatise</span>, a vindication of the clergy of the English church by Robert Some.<br>
<br>At this period Penry seems to have been living intermittently in Northampton, and on 5 September 1588 he married Helen, the daughter of Henry Godly, a minor town official, in All Saints' Church. When Some brought out a rejoinder to <span class="italic">A Defence of that which hath bin Written</span>, Penry embarked on a second reply, but instead of printing this, in October 1588 Waldegrave gave precedence to <span class="italic">The Epistle</span>, the first of the Marprelate tracts.<br>
<br>Although there can be no doubt that by the summer of 1588 he had assumed the management of the secret press, most historians think that Penry took only a minor part, if any part at all, in the writing of the Marprelate tracts, and Leland Carlson has argued persuasively for Job Thockmorton's identification with Martin Marprelate. After the appearance of <span class="italic">The Epistle</span> and the ensuing publicity, Mrs Crane felt unable to shelter the press any longer, and in November Penry negotiated its removal to Sir Richard Knightley's house at Fawsley in Northamptonshire. Early in 1589 it was thought prudent to move the press again, and Knightley arranged for it to go to his kinsman, John Hales, at the White Friars in Coventry. In between Marprelate tracts, Waldegrave published for Penry in February 1589 <span class="italic">A viewe of some part of such publike wants &amp; disorderes as are in the service of God, within her maiesties countrie of Wales, togither with an humble petition, unto this high court of parliament for their speedy redresse</span>.<br>
<br>Increasingly uneasy over Marprelate's levity, Waldegrave left the press in March, sold his type to Throckmorton and withdrew to France, taking with him the manuscript of Penry's most autobiographical tract, <span class="italic">Th' appellation of John Penri, unto the highe court of parliament, from the bad and injurious dealing of th'archb. of Canterb. &amp; other his colleagues of the high commission</span>. Here Penry bewailed yet again &#145;the lamentable misery of soules, wherein my countrymen the inhabitants of Wales live at this present&#146;, before going on to attack &#145;the unjust oppression of Gods church by ungodly and tiranical Lord Bishops&#146;  (Penry, <span class="italic">Th' Appellation</span>, 2, 16). Waldegrave printed <span class="italic">Th' Appellation</span> in La Rochelle in July 1589, returning secretly to England with copies of the work in the autumn.<br>
<br>On Waldegrave's departure Penry hired a new printer, John Hodgkins, and continued his association with the venture, which he next transferred to Wolston Priory at the invitation of Roger Wigston's wife. Government searchers, however, were making it impossible for the press to remain in the midlands, so Hodgkins attempted to move to the north of England, but the press was finally apprehended near Manchester towards the end of August 1589. Penry had not left Wolston when news of the seizure came, and for a time went from one hiding place to another. Then at the beginning of October, provided with money by Throckmorton, he fled to Scotland, where his wife joined him. Waldegrave also sought refuge in Scotland, finding work there as the king's printer.<br>
<br>Hospitably received by the Edinburgh ministers, in <span class="italic">A briefe discovery of the untruthes and slanders (against the true governement of the church of Christ)</span> Penry tried to repay their generosity by defending Scottish presbyterians against the aspersions of disloyalty made by Bancroft in his Paul's Cross sermon of February 1589. Waldegrave published this tract without attribution early in 1590, but when Penry next attempted to clear himself of treasonable activities, in <span class="italic">A treatise wherein is manifestlie proved, that reformation and those that sincerely favor the same, are unjustly charged to be enemies unto hir maiestie and the state</span>, he brought out the work as he normally did, under his own name.<br>
<br>Following protests from the English ambassador about Penry's activities, James VI had him proclaimed an outlaw in the summer of 1590, but apart from a clandestine visit to London at the time of the Hacket conspiracy in July 1591, Penry succeeded in remaining quietly in Scotland for a further two years, involving himself in the far less controversial task of translating a work by Theodore Beza, published as <span class="italic">Propositions and Principles</span> in Edinburgh in 1591. In Scotland he probably also began, but never lived to finish, <span class="italic">The Historie of Corah, Dathan and Abiram</span>, in which he attempted to make a complete separation between allegiance to the crown and membership of the English church. It was published posthumously in Middelburg in 1609.<br>
<br>Until he left England he was a firm believer in the presbyterian form of church government, but Penry, like Robert Browne before him, seems to have changed his opinions after experiencing a presbyterian church at first hand. When in September 1592 he decided to come south to make yet another attempt to procure the conversion of Wales, as soon as he reached London he attached himself to the separatist church of Barrow and Greenwood, then under the leadership of Francis Johnson. Although he accepted no formal office, he certainly preached to the church and drew up petitions for its freedom from arrest and for the release of its members from prison, in addition to composing an answer to <span class="italic">XV Slanderous Articles</span>, which had attacked the separatists.<br>
<br>After several months in flight from the authorities Penry was captured in Stepney on 22 March 1593. Subjected to a series of examinations, he admitted having published <span class="italic">Reformation No Enemie</span> and the <span class="italic">Propositions and Principles</span> while in Scotland. Desperate to prove his innocence of any crime, he next produced a &#145;Declaration of faith and allegiance&#146;, in which he protested his total loyalty to the queen while refusing to associate in public worship with the assemblies of the land. On 6 April Barrow and Greenwood were hanged for treason at Tyburn, and Penry realized that he might well suffer the same fate. On the day Barrow and Greenwood died he composed a farewell letter to his wife, on 10 April another letter to his daughters, and on 14 April one entitled <span class="italic">To the Distressed Faithfull Congregation of Christ in London</span>. His first trial took place in king's bench on 21 May, on a charge of intending to overthrow religion and inciting the queen's subjects to rebellion and insurrection. When the prosecution began using information from private papers taken from him in Scotland, Penry appealed to Burghley against the injustice of the procedure, and the trial was suspended. At a new trial which began on 25 May the prosecution employed <span class="italic">Reformation No Enemie</span> as evidence against him, and he was pronounced guilty of publishing scandalous writings against the church. Although the indictment had made no mention of the Marprelate tracts, the conviction that Penry was Martin Marprelate lay behind his condemnation. On 28 May Penry addressed a final plea to Burghley to procure a pardon from the queen, but Burghley could not help him. Early on 29 May 1593 Whitgift, Sir John Popham, and Sir John Puckering signed the death warrant, and later the same day Penry was hanged at St Thomas-a-Watering in Surrey.<br>
<br>Aged only thirty in 1593, in addition to his young wife Penry left four little daughters, Deliverance, Comfort, Safety, and Sure Hope, the eldest aged four, the youngest only a few weeks old at his death. Deliverance certainly lived to maturity. For a time a member of the household of Francis Johnson, the minister of the exiled separatist church, in May 1611 she married in Amsterdam an English bombazine worker, Samuel Whitaker.<br>
