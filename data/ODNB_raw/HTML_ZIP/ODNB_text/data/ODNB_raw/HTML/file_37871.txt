<span class="headword">Pye,  Edith Mary</span>  (1876&#150;1965), <span class="occ">midwife and international relief organizer</span>, was born on 20 October 1876 in London, the eldest daughter in the family of three daughters and four sons of William Arthur Pye JP, wine merchant, and his wife, Margaret Thompson Kidston, daughter of James Burns Kidston, writer to the signet, of Glasgow. The sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35636/', "Sir David Randall Pye (1886&#150;1960)")</script>, and niece of an eminent surgeon, Edith Pye trained as a nurse (SRN) and midwife (SCM) and by 1907 was superintendent of district nurses in London. In 1908 she joined the Society of Friends.<br>
<br>In December 1914 Edith Pye went to Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne to set up a maternity hospital for women refugees from Rheims in what had been an insane asylum, without hot water or electricity, 15 miles from the fighting line. One thousand babies later, in April 1919, Edith Pye departed, one of very few women to have been made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur.<br>
<br>From March 1921 until October 1922 Edith Pye joined her lifelong friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38518/', "Dr Hilda Clark (1881&#150;1955)")</script>, granddaughter of John Bright, to try to feed all the severely undernourished children under the age of four in Vienna. Together they successfully masterminded the acquisition and distribution of British and American hard currency, with which they bought Croatian fodder to feed the Swiss cows donated to Austria, which in turn provided free milk. Edith Pye privately published Hilda Clark's letters from France, Austria, and the Near East, 1914&#150;24, in a book called <span class="italic">War and its Aftermath</span> (n.d., <i>c</i>.1956), which documents their joint relief operations at that time.<br>
<br>In May 1923 the Quakers sent Edith Pye to report on conditions in the French-occupied Ruhr. She found &#145;a complete absence of civil justice&#146; and the seeds of implacable future enmity. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s her moderate and conciliatory personality worked to mediate between the revolutionary and the gradualist wings of the Women's International League as she served on its international executive. &#145;She was not the sort who enjoyed a scrap&#146;  (private information). In May 1928 the league sent Edith Pye on a three-month goodwill mission to India, Indo-China, and China to study the status of women.<br>
<br>In 1929 Edith Pye became president of the British Midwives' Institute, later called the Royal College of Midwives, a post she occupied for twenty years. It was during her period of office and with her strong encouragement that the chloroform capsule was developed that first enabled midwives to administer pain relief to women in childbirth in their own homes. In July 1932 Edith Pye published an article on this subject entitled &#145;Anaesthetics in labour from the midwife's point of view&#146; in the <span class="italic">Newsletter of the Medical Women's Federation</span>. Between 1934 and 1936 Edith Pye was accorded the honour of being made president of the International Confederation of Midwives.<br>
<br>In addition to this high-profile commitment to midwifery, Edith Pye never ceased her efforts at international rescue work. In 1934 she became vice-chairman of the Friends' Germany emergency committee that she had helped found to succour German and German Jewish refugees from Hitler. During the Spanish Civil War Edith Pye instigated the formation in Geneva of the international commission for the assistance of child refugees in Spain. Between January 1939 and June 1940 she worked on the French&#150;Spanish border to alleviate the wretchedness of the defeated Spanish republicans, only leaving on the last boat to sail for Britain from Bordeaux. Between 1940 and 1945 she worked as honorary secretary to the famine relief committee (chaired by G. K. A. Bell, bishop of Chichester) which tried, via the Red Cross, to send food, vitamins, and medical aid to children in German-occupied Europe, against the wishes of the British Ministry of Economic Warfare. Immediately after the Normandy landings in 1944 Edith Pye toured liberated France with the Friends' relief service to arrange bulk food supplies for the children she found suffering from malnutrition. It was said of her in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>&#151;on the occasion of her seventieth birthday&#151;that her &#145;activities for refugees and humanitarian causes have in their own way been as assiduous as those of the late Eleanor Rathbone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, 10 Oct 1946).<br>
<br>In 1952 Edith Pye and Hilda Clark retired to Street, Somerset. Edith Pye complemented her friend's daring breadth of vision with her own genius for detailed organization. Both women were exceptionally free from egotism, always drawing out the talents of their co-workers and being very willing to delegate authority. Both believed that &#145;there is something that is contagious other than hate&#146;, as Edith Pye said in her Lister lecture to the Quaker Medical Society in 1934. Both women were a credit to what Edith Pye called &#145;the secular arm&#146; of the Society of Friends. Edith Pye died at her home, 4 Overleigh, Street, Somerset, on 16 December 1965 and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground under the same headstone as Hilda Clark.<br>
