<span class="headword">Downe,  John</span>  (1570?&#150;1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Holdsworthy, Devon, the son of John Downe and his wife, Joan, daughter of John Jewel; his uncle, who exerted a strong influence on Downe, was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14810/', "John Jewel")</script>, bishop of Salisbury. Downe was admitted as a pensioner to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 1 July 1586. He proceeded BA in 1590, MA in 1593, and BD in 1600, and was elected a fellow in 1594. In July 1600 he was incorporated at Oxford. He took orders, and was presented by his college to the vicarage of Winsford, Somerset, which he held from 1602 to 1604. In 1604 he was preferred to the living of Instow, in his native county.<br>
<br>Although Downe was a productive and wide-ranging author on issues of Anglican belief and liturgy, it seems that he published nothing during his lifetime and his writings emerged posthumously, under the auspices of his friend George Hakewill, archdeacon of Surrey. Prefixed to <span class="italic">Certain Treatises of the Late Reverend and Learned John Downe</span> (1633) is Hakewill's funeral sermon for Downe, which contains much information about his life. As well as heaping acclamation on his social virtues, in particular his wise and affectionate raising of his family and inexhaustible hospitality, Hakewill dwells long on Downe's erudition, describing him as knowing well the &#145;Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and I think Italian&#146; languages  (<span class="italic">Certain Treatises</span>, 45). In addition, Downe was so deeply versed in theology and patristics that &#145;many, and those not unlearned Divines were content, nay glad to draw water from his well, and to light their candles at his torch&#146;  (ibid., 46). Such, in fact, was his learning in all fields that he was thought extremely unlucky not to have been granted a doctorate, an honour that Hakewill hints he ought to have received.<br>
<br>The ten sermons contained within <span class="italic">Certain Treatises</span> demonstrate Downe to have been an admirable stylist of English. Lucid and elegant, they also show that, despite being renowned for his piety, he was capable of liberal views. Justifying those who gamble &#145;moderately, seasonably, and peacefully&#146;, he concludes &#145;A defence of the lawfulness of lots in gaming&#146; by asking &#145;why should the distemper and irregularity of others prejudice them in the free use of their liberty?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Certain Treatises</span>, 51). His &#145;Prayer to saints and angels neither necessary nor commanded&#146; is a reasoned attack on Catholicism in which he declares &#145;it is now high time to beat down Popery by all meanes&#146;  (ibid., 85).<br>
<br>The diversity of Downe's accomplishments is best illustrated in a second volume, <span class="italic">A Treatise of the True Nature and Definition of Justifying Faith</span> (1635), which contains, as well as several more sermons, some original sacred poems and hymns, translations of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and a verse rendering of Marcus Antonius Muretus's &#145;Institution for children&#146;. A letter from Joseph Hall, bishop of Exeter and Norwich, included in <span class="italic">Certain Treatises</span>  (pp. 55&#150;6) praises his ability in Latin verse, &#145;in which faculty, I dare boldly say, few if any of our age exceed him&#146;. None of this work, unfortunately, appears to have survived.<br>
<br>Downe died, still incumbent of the rectory of Instow, in May 1631. He was buried in the chancel of Instow church, where are also the tombstone of his first wife, Rebecca, who was buried on 6 October 1614, and a monument to John, a son born during his second marriage, to Agnes. Bishop Hall's letter sums up the affection in which Downe was held by his contemporaries: &#145;How much ingenuity, how much learning and worth, how much sweetness of conversation, how much elegance of expression, how much integrity and holiness have we lost in that man?&#146;<br>
