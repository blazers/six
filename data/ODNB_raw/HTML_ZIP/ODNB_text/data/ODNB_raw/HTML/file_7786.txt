<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Domett,  Alfred</span>  (1811&#150;1887), <span class="occ">writer and premier of New Zealand</span>, was born on 20 May 1811 at Camberwell Grove, Camberwell, Surrey, the sixth of the nine children of Nathaniel Domett, a shipowner, and his wife, Elizabeth Curling. He was educated at Stockwell Park House and then St John's College, Cambridge (1829&#150;32), but left university without completing a degree. From 1833 to 1835 he travelled in North America and the West Indies, then returned to read law at the Middle Temple in 1835; he was called to the bar in 1841. He also pursued his literary interests, publishing volumes of poetry in 1833 and 1839. Robert Browning was a family friend.<br>
<br>In April 1842 Domett followed the example of his cousin William Curling, and emigrated to New Zealand on the <i>Sir Charles Forbes</i>. He attained early prominence in the colony through his involvement with the <span class="italic">Nelson Examiner</span> (1843&#150;5), while his petition of November 1845 for the recall of Governor Robert FitzRoy won settler acclaim for its cogent criticism of the humanitarian emphasis in contemporary imperial policies towards the Maori.<br>
<br>Domett's thirty-year career in New Zealand encompassed both political and administrative office. He was appointed by Governor George Grey to the legislative council in 1846, and later served as a provincial councillor for Nelson (1857&#150;63) and as the elected member of the house of representatives for Nelson (November 1855&#150;November 1860) and Nelson City (December 1860&#150;January 1866). He led a short-lived ministry from August 1862 until October 1863, which was notable only for his advocacy of a vigorous policy of military conquest and confiscation during the New Zealand wars. In June 1866 he became a legislative councillor, a political appointment which he held, despite concurrent employment in the public service, until his retirement in 1871.<br>
<br>Domett's administrative contribution in these foundation years was outstanding. An energetic and efficient colonial secretary for New Munster (1848&#150;53), he produced two significant compilations, <span class="italic">Statistics of the Province of New Munster, New Zealand, from 1841 to 1848</span> (1849); and <span class="italic">The Ordinances of New Zealand Passed in the First Ten Sessions of the General Legislative Council, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1841 to <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 1849</span> (1850). In November 1851 he was also gazetted civil secretary to the general government. With the dissolution of crown colony administration, in February 1854 he took up the position of commissioner of crown lands and resident magistrate in the Ahuriri district of Hawke's Bay, and named the streets of Napier to commemorate those countrymen whose military, literary, or scientific achievements he admired. In 1856 he combined political representation with the responsibilities of commissioner of crown lands in Nelson.<br>
<br>A continuing interest in land administration led Domett to retain the portfolio of crown lands during his brief premiership. Political successors acknowledged his expertise by changing the position of secretary of crown lands from a political to a civil service post, with Domett taking up the appointment in January 1864. Over the ensuing eight years the brown-eyed intellectual, whose irritable public manner belied underlying qualities of gentleness and vision, transformed the crown lands office into an efficient regulatory agency for overseeing the implementation of general government land policies. Legislation passed in 1870 to prevent paid politicians from holding civil service positions specifically excluded Domett.<br>
<br>Upon his retirement in 1871, Domett returned to England with his wife, Mary George, a widowed Wellington schoolteacher whom he had married on 3 November 1856. He pursued his literary interests more actively, the epic verse <span class="italic">Ranolf and Amohia: a South-Sea Day-Dream</span>, long derided by critics, being published in London in 1872. His poetic accomplishments were relatively minor and his reputation derives more from his personal associations, particularly his friendship with Browning, than his own verse. A pivotal role in the establishment of the New Zealand parliament's general assembly library was his most enduring literary endeavour.<br>
<br>Domett was created CMG in 1880. He died at his home, 32 St Charles Square, Kensington, London, on 2 November 1887, survived by his wife.<br>
