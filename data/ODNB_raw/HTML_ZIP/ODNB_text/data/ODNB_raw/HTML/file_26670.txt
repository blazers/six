<span class="headword">Strickland,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1419), <span class="occ">bishop of Carlisle</span>, was probably a member of the Westmorland family of Strickland of Sizergh; however, it has also been suggested that he was the son of John Strickland of Great Strickland and his wife, Joan de Vaux. Educated at Oxford University, he was styled clerk by 1362, and <i>magister</i> by 1369. Presumably while still in minor orders he married Alice Warcop, with whom he had a daughter, Margaret, who married first Sir John Derwentwater and second <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71226/', "Sir Robert Lowther")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54528/', "Lowther family")</script>]&#151;the latter was Strickland's principal executor. Recorded as notary public in 1366, by 1368 he was rector of Stapleton in Cumberland, even though he was not ordained to the priesthood until 1381. In the meantime he had entered the service of Bishop Thomas Appleby of Carlisle, on whose behalf he was a mainpernor in 1374, whose proctor he was in parliament in January 1377, and for whom he collected the issues of a clerical subsidy in 1383. He was rewarded by being presented successively to the valuable livings of Rothbury, Northumberland, in 1380 and Horncastle, Lincolnshire, in 1388. He also had connections with the regionally powerful families of Clifford and Percy, acting as a feoffee in the foundation of a Percy chantry in Cockermouth Castle in 1399. Early in 1396 the canons of Carlisle Cathedral elected Strickland their bishop in succession to Appleby, but the election was quashed by the pope. Strickland had come to have lands and interests in and round Penrith, in the south of Cumberland. In 1395 he founded a chantry in St Andrew's Church in that town, and was also responsible for substantial improvements to the town's water supply. In 1399, following a licence to crenellate of two years earlier, he was reported to be &#145;making a fortalice at Penrith on the March of Scotland, for fortifying that town and the whole adjacent country&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1396&#150;9</i>, 480).<br>
<br>Before 8 December 1399, following Thomas Merk's deprivation, Strickland was elected, and on 24 December papally provided, to the see of Carlisle. Henry IV, who had been willing to grant Strickland custody of the temporalities on 18 February, then made difficulties over his installation as a means of putting pressure on the pope to withdraw ecclesiastical immunity from Merk, following the latter's involvement in the conspiracy of January 1400. Nevertheless Strickland was consecrated bishop at Cawood Castle by Archbishop Scrope of York on 15 August 1400, and received full restitution of the temporalities on 15 November. Strickland was occasionally involved in secular affairs. He was appointed a commissioner in 1401 to treat for peace with the Scots, and in 1402 to arrest those declaring Richard II was still alive, while in December 1406 he was one of the bishops who sealed the act entailing the crown on the descendants of Henry IV. He also attended parliament in February 1413. But in spite of the disappearance of his register (extant in 1606 but lost since then), it is clear that he was principally concerned with the administration of his diocese. Much of his activity was conventional in form. But, in a region badly ravaged by war, Strickland attended to the episcopal finances, and reorganized the division of the revenues of St Nicholas's Church, Newcastle, to his own advantage while reducing the vicar's share. No doubt he needed the extra money for building. Tradition ascribed to him the construction of Strickland's Tower at the north-east corner of the inner court of the bishop's palace of Rose Castle, his usual residence, and a major contribution to the rebuilding of Carlisle Cathedral, in progress since a devastating fire in 1292. The tower and north transept, and the canons' stalls in the choir, are attributed to him, an attribution given greater likelihood by the papal indulgence issued in 1410 &#145;for the completion and conservation of the church of Carlisle&#146;  (<span class="italic">CEPR letters</span>, 1404&#150;1415, 220). In his will, dated 25 May 1419, Strickland left 100 marks for masses for his soul, and &pound;10 for distribution to the poor at his funeral. He died on 30 August following, and was buried in Carlisle Cathedral, as he had requested in his will. His obit was still being commemorated there over a century later.<br>
