<span class="headword">Pochin,  Henry Davis</span>  (1824&#150;1895), <span class="occ">manufacturing chemist and industrialist</span>, was born in Wigston, near Leicester, on 25 May 1824, the eldest son of William Pochin (1794?&#150;1850), a Leicestershire farmer, and his second wife. Nothing is known of his early education but at the age of thirteen he spent a short time finishing off his education at the Leicester proprietary school, in which his father had a financial interest. He then entered the chemical and drug trade and was first apprenticed, for five years from 1838, to a Mr Harris of Northampton; he then joined James Woolley in Manchester. After spells in Edinburgh and London he won a certificate of merit in the Pharmaceutical Society's materia medica examination in 1847. In 1848 he rejoined Woolley and, in 1849, with the aid of a loan of &pound;600 from his father, became a partner with Woolley and a Mr Halliday in A. P. Halliday &amp; Co., manufacturing chemists of Salford.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1852 Pochin married Agnes (1825&#150;1908) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56284/', "Pochin, Agnes")</script>], youngest daughter of George Gretton Heap and his wife, Hannah, of Timperley, Cheshire, and the sister of the wife of his late partner, Halliday. Both Pochin and his wife were radicals, having links with John Bright. In 1855 Agnes wrote <span class="italic">The Right of Women to Exercise the Elective Franchise</span>. In 1853 Pochin was elected a member of Salford council; later he was its fifteenth mayor (1866&#150;8). Attempts to enter parliament between 1865 and the early 1870s resulted in failure, however; his only election success, as a Liberal candidate for the county of Stafford in 1868, was subsequently overturned following complaints of intimidation levelled against his agent and supporters during the election.<br>
<br>Following Woolley's death in 1858 Pochin became sole owner of the Salford chemical business, which expanded rapidly, with new branches being opened at Bristol (1863) and Newcastle upon Tyne (1865). The success was linked to Pochin's inventive ability&#151;he patented a process for producing aluminous cake (a substance used in bleaching and papermaking) and, with Edward Hunt, a process for purifying brown rosin used in soap manufacture&#151;and he also provided the financial basis for his involvement, together with a group of associates including David Chadwick (borough treasurer of Salford at the time Pochin became a councillor), in the promotion of several joint-stock companies, mainly in the iron and steel and engineering industries. In this manner Pochin became a director of twenty-two companies, including the Staveley Coal and Iron Company Ltd, John Brown &amp; Co. Ltd, Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co. Ltd, and the Tredegar Coal and Iron Company Ltd. In association with Sir Edward Watkin, Pochin was involved in the rescue of the insolvent Metropolitan Railway Company. He played an important role in its return to prosperity and served as deputy chairman until his death. Pochin was also a director of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway.<br>
<br>In 1870 Pochin, who had previously resided at Broughton Old Hall, Salford, moved to Barn Elms, Surrey, formerly the home of Sir Francis Walsingham. Failure to acquire the estate led him to turn his attention to north Wales, where he acquired a number of properties and subsequently helped to develop the town of Prestatyn as a holiday resort. Among these acquisitions was the Bodnod estate, near Conwy, acquired in 1874 and renamed Bodnant. Pochin took up residence there in 1876, following extensive alterations to both the house and gardens. The well-known landscape gardener Milner assisted with the latter work, though Pochin, a conifer enthusiast, was personally responsible for many changes. It was following additional work by Pochin's daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58228/', "Laura Elizabeth McLaren")</script>, and her son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34777/', "Henry Duncan McLaren")</script>, however, that the gardens at Bodnant acquired their fame.<br>
<br>Pochin, who had been a keen athlete and enjoyed long walks on the Welsh mountains, was an enthusiastic archaeologist and, together with his wife, enjoyed entertaining and intellectual company. In later years he became a justice of the peace, a deputy lieutenant, and the sheriff of Denbighshire. Throughout his life Pochin had suffered from headaches and high blood pressure. In December 1890 he suffered a slight stroke and, though he made a full recovery, following sixteen months of subsequent ill health he died on 28 October 1895 at Bodnant Hall, Eglwys-bach, Denbighshire. He was survived by his wife and two of his six children, Laura Elizabeth and Percival Gerald. With the latter disinherited &#145;for conduct which private papers confirm, fully warranted that decision&#146;  (Milliken, 95&#150;6), Laura, who had married Charles Benjamin Bright McLaren (later first Baron Aberconway), inherited most of her father's property. Pochin was buried in a mausoleum at Bodnant.<br>
