<span class="headword">Lancaster,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1583), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh</span>, was possibly a native of Cumberland. He had graduated BTh by 1536, probably from Oxford University. He was the rector of Offekerque in the pale of Calais from 1536 to 1540.<br>
<br>About 1550 Lancaster published a tract, &#145;The ryght and trew understandynge of the supper of the lord and the use thereof faythfully gathered out of ye holy scriptures&#146;, a copy of which is in the British Library. The book was dedicated to Edward VI but was published under a <i>nom de plume</i> (Johan Turke) as its eucharistic theology was more advanced than that authorized in the first <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. Lancaster's protestantism commended him to Sir James Croft, Edward VI's viceroy in Ireland, and he was nominated to the vacant see of Kildare in April 1550. He was consecrated on 11 July 1550. He was allowed to hold the deanery of Kilkenny <i>in commendam</i> on account of the poverty of Kildare.<br>
<br>Bishop Lancaster was married, although his wife's name is unknown, and on that ground he was deprived of his ecclesiastical offices by a Marian royal commission in 1554. With the accession of Elizabeth to the throne, however, Lancaster was made a royal chaplain. He was granted the rectory of South Hill, Cornwall, and was presented to the treasurership of Salisbury Cathedral by the queen in 1559. He was highly favoured by John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, becoming vicar-general and official principal of Salisbury as well as Jewel's suffragan bishop of Marlborough in 1560&#150;61. He was a member of the lower house of convocation and on 5 February 1563 was in the minority of fifty-eight who approved of the proposed six formulas committing the established church to ultra-protestant doctrine and practices, as against the fifty-nine who opposed the change. In the same year he signed the petition of the lower house of convocation for reform of church discipline. He was admitted as principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 26 February 1565, an office which he held until 1568.<br>
<br>When Sir Henry Sidney became Elizabeth's viceroy in Ireland Thomas Lancaster secured a royal licence in October 1565 to attend upon him and to absent himself from his spiritual duties. He accompanied Deputy Sidney throughout much of his time in Ireland. It was probably on Sidney's recommendation that Elizabeth decided to promote Lancaster as the Church of Ireland archbishop of Armagh and primate in the summer of 1567. Cecil was pleased that the &#145;lusty good priest, Lancaster&#146; was to be promoted  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, Elizabeth, xxi, no. 70). On 28 March 1568 Elizabeth informed the Irish lords justices that she had chosen<blockquote>Thomas Lancaster, one of our ordinary chaplains, heretofore bishop of Kildare in our said realm, and therein for his time served very laudably, and since that time has been very well acquainted in the said part of Ulster, having been lately in company with our said deputy in all his journeys within our said realm, and has preached right faithfully. (ibid., xxiii, no. 86)</blockquote>Because the see of Armagh was left virtually bankrupt by his predecessor, Adam Loftus, Lancaster was allowed to retain the treasurership of Salisbury and the rectories of South Hill and Sherfield, Hampshire, <i>in commendam</i>. He was also granted the archdeaconry of Kells and the rectory of Nobber, Meath diocese, and the prebend of Stagonil, Dublin. Furthermore, Lancaster was loaned &pound;200 by the queen to allow him to become established in Armagh and she secretly made provision to lend him further sums not exceeding &pound;50 if he so required. Archbishop Lancaster was reconsecrated with episcopal orders on 13 June 1568 by Archbishop Loftus of Dublin, Bishop Brady of Meath, and Bishop Daly of Kildare in Christ Church, Dublin. He preached his own consecration sermon on the subject of regeneration.<br>
<br>Elizabeth ordered that Armagh Cathedral and other ruined churches in Ulster be renovated after the devastation wrought by the wars waged by Shane O'Neill, lord of Tyrone. She ordered too that the residence of the archbishop at Armagh be restored, but she secretly intended it to house a provincial council which was to govern the north of Ireland on her behalf. The restoration proceeded slowly, but Elizabeth's provincial council for Ulster was never established. Archbishop Lancaster himself was unable to visit Armagh city in person for fear of his life and was obliged to confine his ministry to those parishes of his archdiocese which were situated in the English pale. It cannot be said that Lancaster's ministry was blessed with much success. The advent of his successor, John Long, was greeted with the hope of a fresh start for the Reformation in Ireland. Archbishop Long himself was of the opinion that there were not forty Irish born Christians in the whole of Ireland, a sorry reflection on Lancaster's fifteen years as primate of the Church of Ireland.<br>
<br>Archbishop Lancaster died at Drogheda in December 1583. He was buried in the vault of Primate Octavian del Palatio in St Peter's Church, Drogheda. Lancaster had intended to found a grammar school by the name of Queen Elizabeth College in Drogheda, and to endow eight exhibitions tenable for scholars at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, but the project failed to materialize as his deathbed will was successfully challenged on the grounds that he was &#145;crazed and sickly&#146; and surfeited with red herring and alcohol when he composed it  (TCD, MS 553). He was survived by a son and two daughters.<br>
