<span class="headword">Posner,  Michael Vivian</span>  (1931&#150;2006), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 25 August 1931 at Queen Charlotte's Hospital, Marylebone Road, London, the son of Jack Posner, millinery manufacturer, and his wife, Lena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buck. Bopth his parents were of Jewish descent. He was originally named Vivian Michael; at what point he reversed the order of his names is unclear. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 40 Mayfair Avenue, Ilford, Essex. The family moved from there to Croydon, where he attended Whitgift School. He won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where after enrolling as a student of modern history he switched to philosophy, politics, and economics. He graduated with first-class honours in 1953. On 7 August the same year he married a fellow student, Rebecca Reynolds (<i>b</i>. 1929), daughter of William Reynolds, a packer at a coal mine. A distinguished scholar, and professor of the Romance languages at the University of Oxford (1978&#150;96), she remained his companion for the rest of his life. They had a daughter and a son.<br>
<br>After graduation Posner worked first as a research officer at the Oxford Institute of Statistics (1953&#150;7) and then briefly in Wesleyan University in the USA (1957&#150;8). He then joined Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he moved to Pembroke College, Cambridge, as a fellow in 1960, relinquishing his fellowship in 1983. Between 1958 and 1979 he also worked in the faculty of economics and politics of Cambridge University, successively as assistant lecturer, lecturer, and reader. He played an important role as secretary of the Cambridge economics faculty for ten years before serving as its chairman in 1974&#150;5. He had the gift of getting the best out of his students with his friendly but firm guidance, and always came forward to help any student suffering from shyness or other difficulties.<br>
<br>Posner's life and work can be seen as a very active intertwining of three passions. First, he was committed to public service in which intelligent policy making in a highly imperfect world restrains unjust outcomes of the working of the market or malfunctioning governance. Second, he followed a Cambridge tradition of applied economics among the pupils of Marshall and Keynes in which theory plays an important but unobtrusive role in reasoned policy advice. In his books on public enterprise, fuel policy, or energy policy, he was careful to set out the possible alternative strategies, depending on changes in assumptions about the real world. His moderation, fair-mindedness, and firm adherence to a concept of public interest won him the loyalty of his co-workers but might have obscured the extent of his achievement in setting out the conceptual elements that would go into policy advice. Finally, he believed that research into real life issues in a world fraught with unexpected changes and uncertainty must accompany teaching of the social sciences in the universities. In his quest for the right mix of evidence and theory to guide policy, he wrote <span class="italic">Italian Public Enterprise</span> (1966, jointly with S. J. Woolf), <span class="italic">Fuel Policy</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">Energy Economics</span> (1981, with Richard Eden and others), as well as editing <span class="italic">Resource Allocation in the Public Sector</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">Demand Management</span> (1978). His advice to the government on matters of energy policy, railway electrification, and macroeconomic management in general was informed by research.<br>
<br>Posner's association with government policy making started in 1966 when he became director of economics at the Ministry of Power. He then served successively as economic adviser and economic consultant to the Treasury (1967&#150;71), energy adviser to the National Economic Development Office (1973&#150;4), economic adviser to the Department of Energy (1974&#150;5), and finally deputy chief economic adviser to the Treasury (1975&#150;6). In between he had a stint as consultant to the International Monetary Fund (1971&#150;2). He was chairman of the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) between 1979 and 1983. In 1985&#150;6 he was economic director of the National Economic Development Office. He was secretary-general of the European Science Foundation from 1986 to 1993. He also served the British Railway Board and the Post Office Board as member. He was appointed CBE in 1983.<br>
<br>As a public servant Posner's crowning achievement was the rescue of the Social Science Research Council from the destructive zeal of Sir Keith Joseph, education minister in the first Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. Joseph was persuaded to choose Lord Rothschild, former chairman of the policy review committee, to report on the future of public funding for social science research, hoping that he would recommend outright abolition of the council. Posner mobilized all his political and intellectual contacts to convince Rothschild that public funding was essential for social science research, and Rothschild's report, submitted in May 1982, endorsed that view. Posner's strategy and hard work helped save the research council, though the word &#145;science&#146;, which offended Joseph's Popperian sensibilities, was expunged, and the council was renamed the Economic and Social Research Council.<br>
<br>In his monographs on fuel policy, public enterprise, and energy policy, and in his proposal of 1972 for a &#145;minimal reform programme&#146; of the world monetary system, Posner provided for alternative scenarios and resulting solutions. But in 1973 the price of oil rose steeply and governments eventually turned to financial and economic liberalization, which conflicted with Posner's views. Even in that era, however, in his work at the European Science Foundation, Posner used his gifts as a leader who listened to others but was firm in his recommendations. At the foundation he emphasized the necessity of forward planning and of retaining the national councils to fund scientific research instead of shifting the entire responsibility to the European Commission.<br>
<br>The qualities of judiciousness and fair-mindedness that had earned Posner the loyalty of his co-workers in the government, the Social Science Research Council, and the European Science Foundation may have deprived him of the credit he deserved for being a pioneer in two interrelated areas of international trade theory: his &#145;International trade and technical change&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Oxford Economic Papers</span> in 1961, contained the germs of the theory of product cycles characterizing trade in manufactures and the signalling of the vastly increased role of intermediate products in global trade flows. In his later work he continued to analyse the effect of technical change on international trade and its policy implications. But he always tried to show that his theory was an outgrowth of received doctrine rather than a break with it. His very modesty in this respect diminished the recognition he deserved in a subject given to shouting of the cheerleaders.<br>
<br>Posner lived latterly at Rushwood, Jack Straw's Lane, Oxford, where he died on 14 February 2006, of heart disease. He was survived by his wife and their two children. A memorial service was held at Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 7 October 2006.<br>
