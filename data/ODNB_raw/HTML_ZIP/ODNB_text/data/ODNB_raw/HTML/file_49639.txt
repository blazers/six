<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fielding,  Alexander Wallace <span class="st"> [Xan]</span></span>  (1918&#150;1991), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and author</span>, was born Alexander Percival Feilman Wallace on 26 November 1918 at Ootacamund, in southern India. His father, Alexander James Wallace&#151;variously described by his son as a major in the Sikhs and as a barrister&#151;and his Irish mother, Mary Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robinson, both died while he was a child. Presumably he was adopted by Percival Wallace Fielding, a company director, whose surname he took. Throughout his life he was known by the diminutive forename Xan. Most of his childhood he spent in France; his stepgrandmother owned the Ch&acirc;teau Fielding, at Nice, which he and his sister long used as their permanent address. From a preparatory school at Harrow he won a classical scholarship to Charterhouse School, but disliked the classics, and sooner than go up to Oxford went to Bonn University in 1937. He moved on to Munich, became involved in anti-Nazi student agitation, and was arrested and run out of Germany by the Gestapo. An attempt to join the International Brigades in Spain also foundered in arrest. From journalism in London he moved eastwards; the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 found him working as a barman in Cyprus.<br>
<br>Fielding spent several months in Athens working on counter-espionage, and was commissioned into the Cyprus regiment in Jerusalem in September 1940; he transferred to the intelligence corps in 1943. After six months as an intelligence officer in the 7th division he moved at the end of 1941 into the Special Operations Executive (SOE), and went by submarine on his first mission into Crete. Lithe and strong, with fluent Greek, he could pass for a Cretan, and made innumerable friends on the island while organizing resistance round Canea. In two long spells, from January to August 1942 and from November 1942 right through to January 1944, he built up&#151;and fought in&#151;substantial guerrilla bands, as well as labouring on German fortifications, of which he took careful note. For his first mission he was appointed to the DSO while still a substantive lieutenant. On his second he succeeded in reconciling the local communist and anti-communist resisters, thus helping to spare Crete some of the civil troubles that tormented much of the rest of Greece. He formed an instant friendship with an SOE colleague, Paddy Leigh Fermor. Both of them relaxed, whenever a chance offered, at a house renamed Tara, in Cairo, with a small group of companions.<br>
<br>Fielding, by now a major, revisited Crete briefly in July 1944, with leave to shoot a fellow officer whom he was able to clear of suspicion, and then moved to the SOE's base at Algiers, from which, ill-codenamed Cath&eacute;drale, he was parachuted into south-eastern France on 9 August to work with Francis Cammaerts (&#145;Roger&#146;), who led all resistance east of the Rh&ocirc;ne. They were both arrested four days later at a chance control near Digne; &#145;Roger&#146; was recognized, and they were saved only by the effrontery and bravery of his courier, Christine Granville [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67777/', "Gizycka, Countess Krystyna")</script>]. Fielding then spent the winter at the SOE's base at Bari, in south-east Italy, and then moved on to Ceylon, intending to operate in Cambodia. The end of the war prevented this; he made a point of visiting the frontier of Tibet before he returned to Europe.<br>
<br>Fielding spent the rest of his life travelling, translating, and writing, delighting many people with his companionship. His wide reading combined with his lively wit, deep voice, and good manners to make him an outstanding talker, once his initial reserve had been penetrated. On 11 July 1953 he married the Hon. Daphne Winifred Louise Thynne, marchioness of Bath (1904&#150;1997), writer, with whom he revisited Crete. She was the elder child and only daughter of George Crespigny Brabazon Vivian, fourth Baron Vivian, and the former wife of Henry Frederick Thynne, sixth marquess of Bath. The marriage ended in divorce in 1978, and on 8 March of the following year Fielding married Agnes (Magouche) Phillips (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), daughter of Commodore John Holmes Magruder, of the US Navy. There were no children of either marriage.<br>
<br>Fielding's <span class="italic">The Stronghold</span> (1953) described the White Mountains in Crete with vivacity and skill; <span class="italic">Hide and Seek</span> (1954) gave more details of his career in the SOE. He also annotated <span class="italic">The Cretan Runner</span> (1955), Leigh Fermor's translation from the Greek of George Psychoundakis. His <span class="italic">Corsair Country</span> (1958) recounted a journey that he made by motor car, with his first wife, along the&#151;then rather inaccessible&#151;Barbary coast of north Africa. He also wrote <span class="italic">The Money Spinner</span> (1977), an account of the casino at Monte Carlo that, as an inveterate gambler, he knew only too well. He translated from French into English a dozen books by Pierre Boulle, one of which was published as <span class="italic">The Bridge on the River Kwai</span> (1954); Chevallier's <span class="italic">Clochemerle-les-Bains</span> (1964); nine novels by Lart&eacute;guy; one by Andr&eacute; Malraux; and several more. When he and his second wife settled in Spain, near Ronda, in Andalusia, he edited the letters exchanged between his neighbour Gerald Brenan and Ralph Partridge, published as <span class="italic">Best of Friends</span> (1986). Four years later he produced a life of one of his Tara companions, Billy McLean: <span class="italic">One Man in his Time</span>. He wrote a short book about the winds, published in an extended German translation as <span class="italic">Das Buch der Winde</span> in 1988 and, in a small limited edition, as <span class="italic">Aeolus Displayed</span> in 1991.<br>
<br>Though suffering from cancer Fielding was able to revisit Crete for the fiftieth anniversary celebrations of the battle of 1941 on the island, where scores of his friends were enchanted to see him. He died in Paris on 19 August 1991, survived by his second wife.<br>
