<span class="headword">Parker,  Albert Edmund</span>, third earl of Morley  (1843&#150;1905), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Kent House, Knightsbridge, London, on 11 June 1843. He was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21296/', "Edmund Parker, second earl of Morley (1810&#150;1864)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21321/', "Parker, John, first earl of Morley (1772&#150;1840)")</script>], and his wife, Harriet Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1897), the only daughter of Montagu Edmund Parker of Whiteway, Devon, and Harriet Newcombe of Starcross, and the widow of William Coryton of Pentillie Castle, Cornwall; Prince Albert was his godfather. He was educated at Eton College, where he subsequently became a fellow and governor, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> and graduated BA in 1865. He succeeded his father in the peerage in 1864 and in 1876 married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1908), daughter of Robert Stayner Holford of Westonbirt and his wife, Mary Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lindsay. They had a daughter and three sons, the eldest, Edmund Robert, succeeding to the title.<br>
<br>In the House of Lords, Morley figured as a polished speaker of Liberal principles. From 1868 to 1874 he was a lord-in-waiting to Queen Victoria during Gladstone's first administration. When Gladstone returned to office in 1880 he became under-secretary for war, serving first under H. C. E. Childers and then under Lord Hartington. He proved an efficient minister, notably in speeches on recruiting and army organization, and he displayed a grasp of affairs during the debates on the occupation of Egypt and the expedition to Khartoum. He left office in 1885.<br>
<br>When the home-rule question arose to divide the Liberal Party, Morley at first followed Gladstone, and from February to April 1886 was first commissioner of public works in Gladstone's third government. On 12 April he resigned, together with Edward Heneage, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, after Gladstone had divulged the scope of his measure. He was elected chairman of committees and deputy speaker of the Lords on 4 April 1889, defeating Balfour of Burleigh, the tory candidate. Morley's pronounced unionism meant this was no real defeat for Salisbury. &#145;My majority&#146;, Morley noted, &#145;was made up of 20 Gladstonians, 44 Liberal Unionists, 30 Conservatives and one bishop.&#146; Morley considerably extended the powers of the chairman, exercising an often decisive influence on the success or failure of private members' legislation. For the guidance of promoters, &#145;a model bill&#146; was annually devised by his standing counsel and himself, and by the beginning of every session the proposed measures, however numerous, had been passed under thorough review. As &#145;&#147;Lord Chairman&#148;&#146;, <span class="italic">The Times</span> concluded, &#145;Lord Morley was an autocrat.&#146;<br>
<br>Attacked by a lingering illness, Morley sent in his temporary resignation in February 1904; his departure was generally regretted. Lord Balfour of Burleigh took his place. On 12 February 1905 he finally resigned and he died fourteen days later, on 26 February 1905, at his home, Saltram, Plympton St Mary; he was buried on 2 March in the parish churchyard.<br>
<br>Morley took an active interest in Devon affairs. He was a chairman of quarter sessions, and vice-chairman of the Devon county council from 1889 to 1901, then chairman from 1901 to 1904. His speeches displayed a wide knowledge of local finance and requirements. In succession to his father and grandfather he involved himself in the Plymouth chamber of commerce, became its president in 1864, and made its annual dinner the occasion for a speech on public affairs. He took pride in the fine collection of pictures at Saltram, and was an enthusiastic gardener.<br>
