<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cohen, Sir  Bernard Nathaniel  Waley-</span>, first baronet  (1914&#150;1991), <span class="occ">public servant and businessman</span>, was born on 29 May 1914 in London, the first son (and twin brother of Hetty) of the three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32481/', "Sir Robert Waley Cohen (1877&#150;1952)")</script>, businessman and government adviser, and his wife, Alice Violet (1882&#150;1935), daughter of Henry Edward Beddington, of Bayswater in London, and Heathside, Newmarket, and his wife, Floretta Marianne. The son of a man who was large in frame and large in personality, a pioneer of industry, and a leading figure in the Anglo-Jewish community, Waley-Cohen (the hyphen was introduced by deed poll in 1950) was groomed from an early age to be of service both to his country and to his co-religionists. His lifetime's achievements were proof that he more than fulfilled his father's expectations and his family's traditional role as a leader of Anglo-Jewry and a prime actor on the financial stage of the City of London.<br>
<br>Although his life was subsequently marked by achievement, the young Waley-Cohen had first to overcome the disappointment of having to give up all thoughts of a career at sea when he was forced to leave the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1930, after only three years, owing to a defect in his eyesight. His sight was to suffer still further when, in 1938, he lost the sight of one eye in a riding accident. A rugged, broad-shouldered young man, Waley-Cohen enjoyed horse-riding, rugby, and mountaineering&#151;he climbed Mont Blanc in 1934. His schooling from 1930 to 1933 was at Clifton College, Bristol, where he was a boarder in Polack's, the Jewish house founded by his great-uncle Lionel Cohen. He then went to Magdalene College, Cambridge, to read modern history. Immediately after leaving Cambridge in 1936, he began his business career for, though &#145;born to a considerable fortune &hellip; he had to make his own way in the City&#146;  (Bermant, 416); he began by joining Lloyd's and within three years was appointed an underwriter.<br>
<br>Commercial activity was disrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War and, unable to serve his country in the armed forces owing to his eye injury, which had also caused him to be discharged by the Honourable Artillery Company, Waley-Cohen turned instead to public service. He became an executive officer attached to the Port of London Emergency Service, a recruiting officer and commander of the Exmoor patrol of the Home Guard, and, between 1940 and 1947, a principal at the Ministry of Fuel and Power alongside Harold Wilson. The end of the war enabled him to combine his commercial, financial, and public-service activities with his love of life in Somerset, where he could supervise his farm on the edge of Exmoor and ride to hounds. From 1953 to 1985 he was chairman of the Devon and Somerset staghounds, subsequently acting as president until his death. His love of hunting led to a number of confrontations with those who opposed blood sports, as well as some acrimonious correspondence in the press.<br>
<br>It was in the post-war years that, still young, Waley-Cohen made his greatest contribution to the City of London, both in his career as a banker&#151;between 1947 and 1954 one of his major roles was as vice-chairman of the Palestine Corporation and the Union Bank of Israel&#151;and as a public servant. At the age of only thirty-five he was appointed a lieutenant for the City of London and alderman for the Portsoken ward. Six years later he was elected to the shrievalty, and in his electoral speech he looked back to his forebear Sir David Salomons, in whose footsteps he was following some 120 years on. Salomons's example was further followed when Waley-Cohen was created KBE in 1957, and in 1960, when he became the seventh Jew and the second youngest individual to be elected lord mayor of the City of London.<br>
<br>It was as lord mayor that Waley-Cohen was truly fulfilled, able to serve the City and his country as best he could, and able to demonstrate, as had members of the cousinhood before him, that he was &#145;a proud Englishman of the Jewish faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 July 1991). On 21 December 1943 he had married Joyce Constance Ina (1920&#150;2013), only daughter and older of the two children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35188/', "Harry Louis Nathan, first Baron Nathan")</script>, and his wife, Eleanor Joan Clara. Waley-Cohen and his vivacious wife made their presence felt at the Mansion House, which was enlivened by the four young Waley-Cohens, Rosalind Alice (<i>b</i>. 1945), Stephen Harry (<i>b</i>. 1946), Robert Bernard (<i>b</i>. 1948), and (Eleanor) Joanna (<i>b</i>. 1952). The charming, articulate lord mayor&#151;Harold Macmillan considered his speech at the traditional Guildhall dinner one of the best he had heard&#151;used his period of office to promote goodwill far beyond the normal lord-mayoral boundaries. During the summer of 1961&#151;a period chosen so as to coincide with the civic recess&#151;he travelled over 30,000 miles to Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East, in order to promote better relations between the City of London and distant lands. An indication of his respect for the ceremony of his position was demonstrated by his taking with him his lord mayor's chain of office and robes of ermine. He was also an active advocate of inter-faith relations between Muslims, Christians, and Jews and, when possible, endeavoured to demonstrate his support in his civic capacity.<br>
<br>Following his period of office as lord mayor, in 1961 Waley-Cohen was made a baronet. Still a young man, he determined to devote himself to good causes and public service. He was appointed commissioner and deputy chairman of the Public Works Loan Commission in 1971 and, in that same year, became chairman of University College, London, of which he had been appointed an honorary fellow in 1963; it was a position he held for nine years. During 1975 he was master of the Clothworkers' Company; among the other causes with which he was closely involved were those of his alma mater, Clifton College, as well as the St Paul's Cathedral Appeal, the College of Arms, and the Marshall Aid Commemorative Commission. The more rural passions were not ignored, however, and Waley-Cohen devoted as much time as was possible to his herds of prize-winning pedigree Devon cattle.<br>
<br>Waley-Cohen was a thickset, bespectacled, physically strong, cigar-loving man, whose looks somewhat belied his affable and compassionate nature. He was a figure in the old-fashioned Anglo-Jewish establishment mould who, though little concerned with religious practice, was dedicated to communal loyalty: loyalty to the section of the Jewish faith which his family had served for well over a century. The nature of the man was revealed by the instructions that appeared in his will regarding his burial. It was to be simple and private, &#145;without any published date, time or place&#146;, and attended only by members of his family and specifically invited friends and colleagues. His modesty and <i>joie de vivre</i> were further underlined by his request that no memorial service be conducted for him, but that two parties be held, one in London and one in Somerset, both on a &#145;generous scale&#146; in order that his friends could be brought together &#145;to remember me and speak of me not in any mournful sense but more in the sense that they have enjoyed my friendship as much as I have enjoyed theirs&#146;  (Waley-Cohen, will, 20 Jan 1980, proved at Bristol).<br>
<br>Waley-Cohen died on 3 July 1991 at his home, Honeymead, Simonsbath, near Minehead, Somerset, of a cerebrovascular accident. He was buried on 5 July 1991 at Willesden Jewish cemetery, Beaconsfield Road, London. He was survived by his wife and four children, and succeeded as baronet by his elder son.<br>
