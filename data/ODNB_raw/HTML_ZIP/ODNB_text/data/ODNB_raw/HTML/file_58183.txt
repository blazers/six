<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stops,  Gervase Frank Ashworth  Jackson-</span>  (1947&#150;1995), <span class="occ">architectural historian</span>, was born on 26 April 1947 at Barratt maternity home, Northampton, the second of four children of Anthony Ashworth Briggs (1914&#150;1986) of Durngate, Northampton, solicitor and afterwards estate agent, and his wife, Jean (<i>b</i>. 1914), an architect, the daughter of Herbert Jackson-Stops of Towcester. His parents were both English and his father changed his name by deed poll to Jackson-Stops in 1948. He was educated at Bilton Grange preparatory school, Warwickshire, then at Harrow School, and in 1965 he won an exhibition to Christ Church, Oxford, where he read modern history, gaining a second in 1968. He was immensely popular and his college tutor described him as &#145;an ornament to the House&#146;.<br>
<br>Jackson-Stops became one of the most brilliant architectural historians of his generation. His fascination for architecture began at an early age. A few miles from his childhood home near Towcester was Easton Neston, Hawksmoor's masterpiece&#151;where as a child Gervase played. A first sighting of that house set him off, and before long he knew all the architectural glories of Northamptonshire. In 1969 he won a Museums Association studentship and worked for three years in different departments of the Victoria and Albert Museum. From there he went, in 1972, to do part-time research for the National Trust. He was paid at first in books, but in no time he was employed full-time as research assistant. The inner core of the National Trust was then still very much a nest of gentlemen and Jackson-Stops was always amused by the term &#145;a modest increment&#146;, which meant he was to have an increase in his salary.<br>
<br>Among Jackson-Stops's earliest duties was revising or rewriting guidebooks. He set new standards of scholarship, and the guidebooks through his inspiration became more complete&#151;seamlessly integrating architecture, family history, and gardening. His writing was always easy on the eye, and the guidebooks are a pleasure to read, being constructed as small detective stories of discovery. He wrote over thirty National Trust guidebooks besides several guides to privately owned properties. Most notable among these is his guide (1978) to Drayton House in Northamptonshire. His thirst for knowledge was insatiable and few things excited him more than a revealing discovery or finding fresh archival evidence. Coupled to this was an effervescent humour, laughter being as much a part of his character as his delight in buildings. He had a rare aptitude for imparting knowledge in an unpedantic manner, and this partly because he took the eighteenth-century approach to enlightenment as his ideal.<br>
<br>Jackson-Stops was short in build with an innocent, querying face that never seemed to have left childhood. The innocence belied a formidable determination. As, too, did his highly idiosyncratic stammer: to get a stuck word out he would click his fingers with increasing rapidity, while any skirting board, chair leg, or commode in striking distance was likely to receive repeated kicks. (Once when in Spain and trying to say &#145;mesa&#146; to the restaurant owner, he had got no further than the click of his fingers when the restaurateur, thinking he had grasped it, said, &#145;Aah, I know, you want the flamenco&#151;I fix.&#146;) The combination of appearance and stammer brought out an immediate sympathy in all but the hardest-hearted.<br>
<br>As well as his guidebooks for the National Trust, Jackson-Stops became one of <span class="italic">Country Life's</span> regular architectural writers. He also made time to produce several books, and memorable among them are: <span class="italic">The English Country House: a Grand Tour</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">The Country House Garden</span> (1987). (A complete bibliography of his writing was published in <span class="italic">Architectural History</span>, 39, 1996.) He was tireless. He would race across the countryside in a car, usually bearing the evidence of his frightening speed, determined to visit as many houses, churches, or monuments in one day as was possible. He saw the past as an intricate and living tapestry where all could be related, and rescued houses that otherwise would almost certainly have been lost: Canons Ashby, Calke Abbey, Chastleton, Kedleston, and at Stowe, the landscaped gardens, to name a few. The National Trust respected his unusual abilities, making him architectural adviser in 1975, and always permitting him complete freedom. Thus he lived and worked by his own itinerary.<br>
<br>Ability and great personal charm made Jackson-Stops the perfect choice to mastermind, as guest curator, the Treasures of Britain exhibition for the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, in 1985. To him fell the delicate task of choosing, and persuading owners to part with, their objects so that the exhibition could explain Britain's wealth of belongings, many still in private hands. The exhibition was a great success and for it he was made OBE in 1986. Accompanying the exhibition was a magnificent catalogue which he edited.<br>
<br>Jackson-Stops's other passion was for the ruin he resurrected and made his home. He bought The Menagerie&#151;a spectacular eighteenth-century eyecatcher in Horton Park, near Northampton&#151;for a trifle in the early 1970s. For the next twenty years he restored and embellished it. A superb craftsman, Christopher Hobbs, repaired the severely damaged rococo saloon, quite possibly one of the finest in Britain. And, as The Menagerie went through a succession of improvements&#151;from the house to the garden to an elaborate grotto&#151;so Jackson-Stops gave parties, often with an opera included, wanting friends to enjoy his own inspired adoration of the civilizing amusements.<br>
<br>Jackson-Stops shared The Menagerie with two great friends. First the writer Simon Blow, who found his ready laughter and high spirits infectious, and latterly with a much younger friend, Ian Kirby, who had recently gained a horticultural diploma from Kew and went on to design the Menagerie garden for him in a style both traditional and inventive. Only the week before he died, frail and wasted but as determined as ever, Jackson-Stops, attired as an admiral, held a maritime party to celebrate the opening of the grotto. He could dress up&#151;or down&#151;in an instant. He once emerged from a naked bathe smothered in seaweed to resemble a sea monster and, on another occasion, he appeared at a fancy-dress ball rouged and bewigged as Dame Barbara Cartland, a stuffed Pekinese called Twee Twee under his arm. &#145;I have arrived,&#146; he announced as he descended the staircase.<br>
<br>It was Jackson-Stops's sheer enthusiasm that made for much of the originality with which he interpreted a house, and he brought new life to historical research. To his last hours architecture delighted him. Dying of an AIDS-related illness in St Bartholomew's Hospital, Smithfield, London, on 2 July 1995, he could see from his bedroom window the stone figure of Justice with her gilded scales that crowns the dome of the Old Bailey. &#145;Look&#151;isn't it wonderful! Quite wonderful!&#146; he would exclaim. From his bed he arranged the music for his memorial service, which was held at All Saints' Church, Northampton, where he had been baptized. A full orchestra with singers performed Haydn's Nelson mass. It was attended by more than 700 people, a testimony to how dearly he was loved and missed. He was buried on private land on 8 July.<br>
