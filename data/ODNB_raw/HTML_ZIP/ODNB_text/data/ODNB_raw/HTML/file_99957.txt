<span class="headword">Jennett,  (William) Bryan</span>  (1926&#150;2008), <span class="occ">neurosurgeon</span>, was born on 1 March 1926 at Finglas, Waldegrave Road, Twickenham, the only son of Robert William Jennett (1884/5&#150;1956), a civil servant of Irish descent in the Ministry of Labour, and his Scottish wife, Jessie Pate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Loudon (1892&#150;1975). Through his mother he was related to at least fifteen medical practitioners. He had two sisters, Jean (<i>b</i>. 1923) and Sheena (<i>b</i>. 1929). He was educated at King's College, Wimbledon, and King George V School, Southport. At Liverpool medical school he was the top graduate of his year, in 1949, and was president of the British Medical Students' Association. He married his classmate Sheila Mary Pope (<i>b</i>. 1926) at Liverpool South register office on 15 September 1950 followed the next day by a service at Liverpool Anglican Cathedral. She was the daughter of Robert Herbert Pope, professional tenor and tea merchant, and went on to have a distinguished career as a respiratory physiologist. They had three sons, Peter, Martin, and John, and a daughter, Hilary.<br>
<br>Jennett's neurosurgical training and his abiding interest in head injuries began when he was house surgeon to Sir Hugh Cairns in Oxford and then, during national service, surgical specialist at the Royal Army Medical Corps hospital in Wheatley. Training posts followed in Cardiff and Manchester. He gained the fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1952, and in 1961 he gave a Hunterian lecture there on post-traumatic epilepsy. A Rockefeller fellowship in 1958/9 with the neurophysiologist Horace Magoun at the University of California, Los Angeles, produced the work on experimental brain compression for which he was awarded an MD by the University of Liverpool in 1960.<br>
<br>In 1963 Jennett was appointed to a combined NHS and university consultant neurosurgical post in the West of Scotland unit at Killearn Hospital and then became the first holder of the chair of neurosurgery at the University of Glasgow, from 1967 to 1991. He found a supportive, multidisciplinary collaborative environment in the Institute of Neurological Sciences, developed by J. Sloan Robertson, and in the university under the leadership of Sir Charles Illingworth. He was able to express his commitment to applying laboratory and clinical research to the care of patients and his philosophy of bringing scientists from other fields to apply their expertise to the solution of neurosurgical problems. The understanding gained in the 1960s and 1970s of relationships between brain blood flow and intracranial pressure changed the practice of neuroanaesthesia and advanced the treatment of patients with acute brain damage. During this time he co-directed with A. Murray Harper the Medical Research Council's cerebral circulation research group.<br>
<br>In the 1970s, in order to support rational decision-making, Jennett's focus turned to assembling information on the prognosis of severe injury. He addressed the social, ethical, and philosophical issues arising in the care of very severely brain damaged people and, in 1972, along with Fred Plum, a leading American neurologist, he first described the &#145;persistent vegetative state&#146; in an article in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. He later contributed influentially to the debate that clarified legal aspects of the management and decisions about limitation of treatment of such people. The Glasgow coma scale, described with Graham Teasdale in 1974, and the Glasgow outcome scale, described with Michael Bond in 1975, established an international common language to assess brain damage, and over the next thirty-five years the papers in which they were presented, again published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, became the two most frequently cited neurosurgical publications. International collaborative studies of prognosis and treatment followed, unique in their scale and continuity, which became the foundation of a critical search for improved treatments. Identification of risk factors for complications after mild injuries led to neurosurgeons under his leadership developing the first national guidelines for head injury care. Meanwhile the outstanding department that he created in Glasgow attracted trainees from many countries whom he inspired and supported enthusiastically and generously throughout their careers. Through them he advanced the academic approach to neurosurgery throughout the world.<br>
<br>Jennett (known to friends and colleagues as &#145;B.J.&#146;) was an outstanding communicator: lucid, rational, and convincing. He wrote almost 300 papers, the last in December 2007, and the clarity of his writing produced several influential books: <span class="italic">Epilepsy after Head Injuries</span> (1962, revised edn, 1975), <span class="italic">Introduction to Neurosurgery</span> (1964, running to five editions by 1994), <span class="italic">Management of Head Injuries</span> (with Graham Teasdale, 1981), <span class="italic">High Technology Medicine: Benefits and Burdens</span> (1984, revised edn, 1986), and <span class="italic">The Vegetative State: Medical Facts, Ethical and Legal Dilemmas</span> (2002). In 1980, in the face of great public controversy and concern caused by a <span class="italic">Panorama</span> documentary questioning the criteria used to establish brain death in potential organ donors, he courageously led a robust, effective defence both of the concept of brain death and of the criteria and codes of practice used to identify it; this proved pivotal in sustaining and then increasing the number of organs available for transplantation.<br>
<br>Between 1981 and 1986 Jennett served as dean of medicine at Glasgow University. His expanding breadth of interest and interactions with economists and policy makers led to his intellect and instinct for rigorous analysis being increasingly applied to issues across medicine and its interface with society. Ahead of his time, these included influential reports on the appropriate use of high-cost technology and the organization, with Barbara Stocking of the King's Fund, of a novel series of consensus conferences on clinical practice. He held many leadership roles in professional and public bodies including presidency of the neurology section of the Royal Society of Medicine (1986&#150;7), the International Society for Technology Assessment in Health Care (1987&#150;9), and Headway, the national head injury patients' group (1988&#150;95). On retirement in 1991 he was appointed CBE and in 1993 he was awarded an honorary DSc by St Andrews University. In September 2007 he was the first recipient of the medal of the Society of British Neurological Surgeons.<br>
<br>Jennett's main recreation after settling in Scotland was sailing, a pastime shared with his wife, Sheila, and all his family. He died at his home, 3/3 Lauderdale Mansions, 47 Novar Drive, Glasgow, on 26 January 2008 from complications of multiple myeloma, diagnosed in 2002. He was survived by his wife and their four children.<br>
