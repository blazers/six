<span class="headword">Hoste,  Dirick</span>  (<em>c.</em>1588&#150;1663), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was born in Middelburg, Netherlands, the son of Jacques Hoste (<i>b</i>. 1545), a merchant, and his wife, Barbara Henricksen. His father and grandfather had fled Oudenarde in Flanders for religious reasons in the wake of the &#145;Wonderyear&#146; of 1566&#151;the failed protestant insurrection in the Netherlands. The family settled in London in 1567, then around 1580 moved to Middelburg in Zeeland, where Dirick and his twin brother, Jacques, were born. By 1607 Dirick had arrived in London and on 12 October 1613, at Austin Friars, he married Jane van Meteren or Desmaistres (1596&#150;1661) , the daughter of the wealthy immigrant London brewer James van Meteren. They lived in Abchurch Lane, near London Bridge. Despite his family's roots in the cloth trade Hoste focused on general overseas trade. In 1615 he became a member of the East India Company, and by 1625 he belonged to a group of Dutch and Flemish merchants who supplied the king of Spain with gunpowder, cordage, and iron for his ports in Africa. His many international trading contacts made it easy for him to operate as a successful banker and financier, and among his customers were the royal physician Sir Th&eacute;odore de Mayerne and the Spanish ambassadors to London. According to John Aubrey, the Spanish customs farmers who financed the Catholic imperial armies in the Netherlands and Germany during the Thirty Years' War kept their cash on deposit with him. Considering Hoste's strong commitment to the Calvinist cause, this is somewhat surprising. From the outset he was an active member of the Dutch Reformed church in London, where he was elected deacon in 1627. A year later he was promoted to the eldership, thus following in the footsteps of his father, who had regularly served the reformed church in Middelburg in this capacity between 1597 and 1605. He was prominently involved in two of the major collections for persecuted Calvinist brethren abroad&#151;in 1630 he was one of four elders responsible for the second English collection for refugee Calvinists from the German palatinate, while in 1643 he was among the four parliamentary commissioners appointed to raise funds for suffering Irish protestants in the Netherlands. In this latter enterprise he was joined by the City radical and colonizer Maurice Thomson, with whom he had already co-operated closely in the mercantile field.<br>
<br>Hoste played a major role within the Dutch Reformed church in London for at least two decades. In 1646 he was chosen, together with the minister Cesar Calandrini, to negotiate with the Independent and Baptist leaders Sidrach Simpson and William Kiffin on behalf of the church. In 1649, on account of his excellent relations with the speaker of the House of Commons, William Lenthal, and the radical London mercer Colonel Edmond Harvey, he was able to help the many weavers within the Dutch community who had come under attack from the Weavers' Company. In addition he found time to publish, in an English translation, <span class="italic">Of Death, a True Description</span> (1629), written by his friend and consistorial colleague Jacob Cool. During the civil war and interregnum, in 1643&#150;5 and again in 1651&#150;2, he lived in Middelburg, where he owned several houses. By 1654, however, he had retired permanently to his country house in Mortlake in Surrey. Of his thirteen children only four survived childhood: Joanna, who married Peter vander Put; James, who married Elizabeth Sleigh; Theodorus, who married Anne Chilcott; and Mary, who married Sir Stephen Langham. Hoste died a wealthy man in Mortlake in March 1663, and was buried there on 24 March.<br>
