<span class="headword">Langdon,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1638), <span class="occ">land surveyor</span>, was certainly practising by 1589 and possibly a year or two earlier. He had a brother, Vallence, who briefly assisted him, a sister, who married Thomas Patchet, and a relative of the same name, who was living in Lambeth in 1638. He was educated at New College, Oxford, and proceeded to the degree of BCL in July 1599, having become MA and studied civil law for three years. He probably learned his surveying skills from the land surveyor Thomas Clerke, to whom he was assistant by 1589, and possibly in 1587, and continued as such until Clerke's death in 1602.<br>
<br>Langdon's career as one of the leading land surveyors and map makers of his time spanned about thirty years, and flourished as landowners were coming to appreciate the value of maps both as tools of estate management and as decorative objects of prestige. Several Oxford colleges were taking greater interest in their estates and their profitable management, and Langdon surveyed land all over England for them. He succeeded his former master as surveyor to the estates of All Souls College, Oxford, and continued in the college's employment until 1605. In 1600&#150;01 he was paid for surveying for New College, in 1602 he mapped the Cambridgeshire estates of Merton College, and in 1607 he surveyed an estate in Leicestershire for Brasenose College. Corpus Christi College employed him too, from 1605 to 1607, in 1609, and from 1615 to 1616; in his third period of working for the college he was assisted by a pupil, Henry Wilcocke. Langdon was employed not only by Oxford colleges but also by private individuals, including Sir Thomas Cecil and Sir John Byron. His last known employment as a surveyor was by the London Charterhouse, whose estates in Cambridgeshire and Wiltshire he surveyed from 1616 to 1618. Langdon's maps, drawn of estates in about fifteen counties, are distinctive and their embellishments with Elizabethan strap-work ornamentation show his skills as an artist and draughtsman.<br>
<br>Langdon had become curate of Tithby, Nottinghamshire, probably in 1603, and remained there for the rest of his life. He married Joan Sharples on 3 February 1606 in Langar, Nottinghamshire. Their daughter Rosamund (<i>d</i>. 1633) married George Darker (<i>d</i>. 1658) at St Peter's Church, Nottingham, on 3 July 1630. By his will, made on 1 March 1638 and proved on 11 October 1638, Langdon left bequests to his wife and granddaughter and his surveying instruments to his son-in-law, who may therefore have been his apprentice or assistant.<br>
