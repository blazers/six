<span class="headword">Lloyd,  David</span>  (1752&#150;1838), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born on 12 May 1752 at Croes Cynon (Croscunnon), Llanbister, Radnorshire, the only son of Thomas Lloyd, a farmer of Trefodig, and his wife, Mary, daughter of David James of Little Croscunnon. Although as a boy he had to work on his father's farm a lot of the time, he received a sporadic education in Latin and mathematics from local schools, as well as teaching himself Greek and developing an appreciation of &#145;Druidical&#146; and Welsh poetry. In 1771 at the age of nineteen he opened a small school in Llanbister. While teaching he prepared himself for holy orders and was ordained priest in 1778. He married Mary (1747&#150;1836), daughter of John Griffiths of Leehall, Llangunllo, Radnorshire, in 1779, and they had one son, John, who died in childhood. Lloyd was curate at Putley, Herefordshire, between 1785 and 1789, before returning to be vicar of Llanbister, one of the largest parishes in Radnorshire, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1792 Lloyd published <span class="italic">The Voyage of Life</span>, a religious poem in nine volumes. A new and enlarged second edition was published in 1812; renamed <span class="italic">Characteristics of Men, Manners and Sentiments, or, The Voyage of Life</span>, it contained an additional (tenth) volume to the original as well as some miscellaneous poems. His other main work was <span class="italic">Horae theologicae, or, A series of essays on subjects interesting and important; embracing physics, morals and theology</span>, published in 1823. The thirty-seven essays, which include such titles as &#145;The authenticity of the scriptures&#146;, &#145;The nature and effects of sin&#146;, and &#145;The fall of our parents and its effects&#146;, are in fact entirely theological, and provide a brief exposition of the faith of the Anglican church, designed for the &#145;improvement in Divine knowledge, and confirmation of faith, in readers of all ranks&#146;  (preface). His only other published works were a sermon, <span class="italic">England's Privileges</span> (1797), and an undated march entitled <span class="italic">The Loyal Cambrian Volunteers</span>. Of the many pieces of his music, the latter was the only one to be published. Lloyd's wife died in 1836 aged eighty-nine, and he died at Llanbister two years later, on 3 March.<br>
