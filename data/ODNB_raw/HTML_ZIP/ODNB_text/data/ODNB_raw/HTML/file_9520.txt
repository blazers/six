<span class="headword">Fitton,  Alexander</span> <span class="st"> [styled Sir Alexander Fitton]</span>, Jacobite Baron Fitton  (<em>d.</em> 1699), <span class="occ">politician and Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was probably born in Dublin, a younger son of William Fitton of Awrice, co. Limerick, and his wife, Eva, daughter of Sir Edward Trevor of Brynkinallt, Denbighshire; he was great-grandson of the Elizabethan adventurer Sir Edward Fitton (1527&#150;1579) of Gawsworth, Cheshire, who founded the Irish branch of the family and grandson of Alexander Fitton, who settled there. William was drawn back to England in 1643 by the prospective inheritance of the ancestral estate in Cheshire, and he brought Alexander with him. It was in the struggle over the Fitton property in Cheshire and Lancashire that Alexander first came to prominence.<br>
<br>Sir Edward Fitton, second baronet (1604&#150;1643), great-grandson of the adventurer, grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9522/', "Sir Edward Fitton (1548/9&#150;1606)")</script>, and head of the Cheshire line, died without leaving a son or living brothers in August 1643. Though Sir Edward had seven sisters, by a settlement of 1641 he left his estate to his Irish relatives, who would perpetuate the Fitton name. In 1649, upon Alexander's marriage to Ann Joliffe (<i>d</i>. 1687) of Coston Hackett, Worcestershire, mortgages encumbering the estate were cleared, and upon the death in January 1655 of Felicia, Lady Fitton, Sir Edward's widow, William and his son took possession of the property, over the strenuous objections of the other heirs. William's decision to send his son to the Inner Temple in 1655 must have been at least in part a result of his concern over his title to the estate. Alexander was eventually called to the bar on 12 May 1662, and needed all his legal skills to defend his inheritance.<br>
<br>Following the Restoration, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10550/', "Charles Gerard, Lord Gerard of Brandon (c.1618&#150;1694)")</script>, son of Sir Edward's eldest sister Penelope, returned from his royalist exile and produced a will dated 16 August 1643, revoking the 1641 settlement. This document gave Gawsworth and all the Fitton lands to Gerard. A series of lawsuits ensued, in which the inheritance was disputed in courts from Cheshire to the House of Lords. The case became a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, and both sides accused the other of forgery. Gerard produced a witness, Abraham Granger, who testified that he forged the 1641 settlement. In November 1662 king's bench declared Fitton's possession illegal and awarded a verdict for Gerard. Despite this defeat Fitton continued to pursue his case, publishing in 1663 <span class="italic">A true narrative of the proceedings in the severall suits in law that have been between the Rt. Hon. Charles Lord Gerard of Brandon and Alexander Fitton, esq.</span> This pamphlet, supposedly published in The Hague, purported to be Granger's confession. In it he claimed that Gerard had forced his testimony with a mixture of threats and the promise of a pension. The pamphlet claimed that Gerard's 1643 will was in fact a forgery. Granger, well known in London as a forger, was hardly a reliable witness for either side, and determining the truth of either claim is difficult. The courts sided with Gerard when his stock at court was high, and later, when the political winds changed, Fitton received gentler treatment.<br>
<br>Overall, however, Fitton suffered most. He lost possession of Gawsworth in 1663; on 9 July in the same year the House of Lords declared the <span class="italic">True Narrative</span> a scandalous libel, fined Fitton &pound;500, and gaoled him until he found sureties for life. Gerard, not long afterward promoted earl of Macclesfield, seems to have held a grudge, for the hapless Alexander remained imprisoned until 1684, by which time Gerard, a close associate of the duke of Monmouth, had lost the king's favour.<br>
<br>James II's accession dramatically reversed Fitton's fortunes. He used his new-found liberty to revive his case against Macclesfield. In this second round of the dispute Fitton hoped for more success. The Lords heard his petition on 23 May 1685, when Macclesfield was in deep disfavour; by September he had fled the country and was outlawed. Fitton, by contrast, became, to the surprise of many, the king's choice for lord chancellor of Ireland. In January 1687 his appointment was announced, and shortly afterward he was knighted. His salary was raised from &pound;1000 to &pound;1500 in April 1687, a boon which closely followed his conversion to Roman Catholicism.<br>
<br>During his short period as lord chancellor, Fitton seems to have served conscientiously, and he was a loyal agent of Lord Deputy Tyrconnell. He opposed the revolution, and on 1 May 1689 James raised him to the peerage as Baron Fitton of Gawsworth&#151;though his new rank was never recognized in England. In 1690 the exiled king named him one of the three lords justices of Ireland. By July 1690 he had joined the court at St Germain and was attainted by parliament. In exile Fitton continued to play a role in James's counsels. In January 1699 the king's will appointed him, along with eight others, to a council which would advise Queen Mary after his death. In England Fitton's lawsuits against Macclesfield foundered upon the rock of his own Jacobitism and the earl's influence with William III; he never regained possession of Gawsworth. He died at St Germain in November 1699.<br>
