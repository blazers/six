<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bentwich,  Norman de Mattos</span>  (1883&#150;1971), <span class="occ">colonial official and exponent of Jewish ideals</span>, was born in London on 28 February 1883, the elder son and second of eleven children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59277/', "Herbert Bentwich (1856&#150;1932)")</script> and his wife, Susannah, daughter of Joseph Solomon, leather merchant, and sister of Solomon J. Solomon, painter. His father, a solicitor, was an active member of the Anglo-Jewish community who brought up his family in the fervent belief that Israel had a continuing religious mission to fulfil, while his mother stressed the universal values of music and art. The Hebrew scholar Solomon Schechter was a great friend of his father. He attended St Paul's School whence he went as major scholar to Trinity College, Cambridge. He read classics, winning the Yorke essay prize twice, and rabbinics under Solomon Schechter. He obtained first classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1903 and 1905). In 1905 he took up law with the Whewell scholarship and was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1908.<br>
<br>In 1912 Bentwich entered the Egyptian ministry of justice as inspector of native courts. In 1915 he joined the British army in Egypt (Camel Transport Corps) and took part in the conquest of Jerusalem, which earned him the rank of lieutenant-colonel, an MC, and appointment as OBE (1918). In 1915 Bentwich married Helen Caroline Franklin (1892&#150;1972) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61364/', "Bentwich, Helen Caroline")</script>], daughter of Arthur Ellis Franklin, banker and company director. There were no children.<br>
<br>In 1918 Bentwich became legal secretary to the British military administration in Palestine and after the establishment of the mandatory government in 1922 he became the country's first attorney-general. Bentwich's wife was the niece of Lady Samuel, wife of the then high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. In Zionist politics Bentwich was moderate, working for Arab&#150;Jewish understanding and a bi-national state. But with the conflict between the two nations steadily intensifying, the government was bound to find a Jewish attorney-general a political embarrassment, however reconciling his personal views might be. In 1929 Bentwich clashed with a subsequent high commissioner, Sir John Chancellor, over plans to prevent the sale of &#145;Arab land&#146; to Jews. Unfortunately, the Colonial Office supported Chancellor. Bentwich was put on paid leave, and then detained in London under the pretext of &#145;giving temporary assistance to the Legal Department of the Colonial Office&#146;  (Shepherd, 113). Bentwich was offered promotion in the service outside Palestine, and, when he declined, was retired from the colonial service in 1931.<br>
<br>In 1932 Bentwich was appointed professor of international relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His inaugural lecture, &#145;Jerusalem, city of peace&#146;, was interrupted by students who opposed his pacifying approach and had to be continued under police protection. The terms of the chair provided that the holder would lecture during only one of the two terms of the year and otherwise be free to work in the field of international relations where he wished. He made full use of these opportunities. Thus, when the Nazi persecutions began, he became one of the foremost fighters for the rescue of the oppressed. He travelled to all countries, pleading with governments and investigating possible places of refuge. He became director both of the League of Nations high commission for refugees from Germany (1933&#150;5) and of the Council for German Jewry.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Bentwich served in the Ministry of Information in London, and for a time in the Air Ministry. He lectured for the government, especially in the United States. In 1943 he went to the Middle East and to Ethiopia where he advised the emperor on the treaties to be concluded with Great Britain. During the following years he was engaged, as chairman of the Anglo-Abyssinian Society, in furthering Ethiopia's claim for the recovery of Eritrea, and attended the Paris conference of 1946 as a member of the Ethiopian delegation. In addition he took up the cause of the Falashas, an Ethiopian tribe who consider themselves Jews, but are not recognized as such by Israel and most Jewish communities.<br>
<br>Bentwich was chairman of the National Peace Council (1944&#150;6) and in the post-war period had a major part in securing restitution and compensation for the victims of Nazi persecutions. In 1951, having reached the statutory age, Bentwich retired as professor at the Hebrew University, and was elected a member and vice-chairman of its board of governors. Work for the university now became his main concern. Since its foundation the Hebrew University had been to him the symbol of Jewish renaissance and of all the causes he served probably this was nearest to his heart. He was president of the London North-Western Reform Synagogue from 1958 until his death.<br>
<br>Bentwich was the author of nearly thirty books on subjects ranging from Judaeo-Greek civilization to international law, refugees, and the rebirth of Israel. These included a major biography of Solomon Schechter. He was awarded honorary doctorates from the universities of Aberdeen (1942), Melbourne (1938), and Jerusalem (1956). He was always ready to help others, indefatigable in the causes he had taken up, and deeply committed to what he considered right. He sometimes wondered whether his life had perhaps lacked a certain &#145;one-pointedness&#146; and had been too much divided between different worlds. But however this may be, all divisions were overcome and reconciled by his gentle personality and his spirit of service.<br>
<br>Between 1919 and 1931 Helen Bentwich had documented the social life of the mandate in letters home. Norman Bentwich quoted these extensively in <span class="italic">Mandate Memories, 1918&#150;1948</span> (1965), and in 1999 the letters themselves were published. Helen Bentwich was active in local government in London in her later career, and served as a Labour councillor. She was chair of the London county council (1956&#150;7) and was appointed CBE in 1965.<br>
<br>Bentwich died in London on 8 April 1971 and according to his wish was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Scopus. Helen Bentwich died in 1972.<br>
