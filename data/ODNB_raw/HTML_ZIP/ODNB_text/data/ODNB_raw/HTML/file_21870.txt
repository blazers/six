<span class="headword">Pennethorne,  John</span>  (1808&#150;1888), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was the youngest of the seven children of Thomas Pennethorne (1762&#150;1843), a hop merchant, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Salt (<i>d</i>. 1849), a schoolmistress. He was born at Worcester on 4 January 1808 and in the late 1820s followed his older brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21869/', "Sir James Pennethorne")</script> into the office of John Nash in London. In 1830 he began a five-year tour of professional study in Europe and Egypt, visiting Paris, Milan, Florence, Venice, Rome, Sicily, Athens, and Thebes, which determined his subsequent career. On his first visit to Athens in 1832 he became interested in the geometrical &#145;refinements&#146; of the temples of the Acropolis, notably the introduction of subtle curvature for the horizontal lines&#151;something alluded to by Vitruvius. While spending the winter of 1833 at Thebes he made careful studies of the mouldings and coloured decorations of the temples and tombs, and came to the conclusion that the colouring and ornamentation of Greek temples, as well as some aspects of their geometry, derived ultimately from Egypt. On returning to Athens in 1834, he renewed his study of the Parthenon, taking wax moulds of the mouldings and ornaments. He returned to England in 1835, but in 1837 he again visited Athens to make more complete observations and measurements of the curved lines of the steps, stylobate and entablature, and the inclination of the columns, of the Parthenon. He finally came to the conclusion that there was no foundation in fact for the conventional belief that the system of design in Greek architecture was absolutely rectilinear. The same conclusion had already been reached by Josef Hoffer, and Hoffer's research was published in C. F. L. F&ouml;rster's <span class="italic">Allgemeine Bauzeitung</span> in 1838  (3.249) quoting measurements of the Parthenon which had been made independently of Pennethorne's investigations by Edward Schaubert, an architect working for the Greek government.<br>
<br>Ill health forced Pennethorne to return to England in 1837, and in 1844 he published, for private circulation, a pamphlet of sixty-four pages, <span class="italic">The elements and mathematical principles of the Greek architects and artists, recovered by an analysis and study of the remaining works of architecture designed and erected in the age of Pericles</span>, in which he drew upon passages in Plato, Aristotle, and Vitruvius, as well as his own discoveries, to set forth a theory of &#145;optical corrections&#146;. His discoveries had already been noticed by W. M. Leake in his <span class="italic">Topography of Athens</span> (1841), and in 1845&#150;7 they were pursued by F. C. Penrose, who in 1851 published his <span class="italic">Investigations of the Principles of Athenian Architecture</span>. The elaborate and exact measurements here given supplied Pennethorne with the mathematical data necessary to work out fully his theory of optical corrections.<br>
<br>In 1851 Pennethorne settled with his unmarried sister Anne at Hamstead, John Nash's farm on the Isle of Wight, and for several years he devoted himself to agriculture. He resumed his studies in 1860, and in 1878 he published, at his own expense, an impressive folio volume, <span class="italic">The geometry and optics of ancient architecture, illustrated by examples from Thebes, Athens, and Rome</span>, with fifty-six plates by John Robinson, a pupil of his brother James. His findings were summarized in a paper on &#145;The connection between ancient art and the ancient geometry, as illustrated by works of the age of Pericles&#146;, published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects</span> (1878&#150;9). His argument was that the Greek architects, having first designed a building so that geometrically its proportions were harmonious, afterwards corrected those dimensions with reference to the visual angle under which it would be seen, and by these methods of work produced a building which optically displayed the same harmony of proportion as characterized the merely geometrical projection. These optical corrections, he believed, contributed greatly to the superiority of Greek architecture over Roman. His conviction that Greek temples were designed to be seen only from certain points of view was challenged in his lifetime and was not accepted by later scholars. But his careful research, embodied in his book of 1878, made an important contribution to the understanding of the architecture of ancient Greece and of the importance of mathematics in determining architectural proportion.<br>
<br>Pennethorne died, unmarried, at Hamstead, Isle of Wight, on 20 January 1888.<br>
