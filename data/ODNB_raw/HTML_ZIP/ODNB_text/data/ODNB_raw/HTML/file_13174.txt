<span class="headword">Haynes <span class="st"> [Heynes]</span>,  Simon</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1552), <span class="occ">clergyman and religious reformer</span>, was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1515/16, MA in 1519, BTh in 1528, and DTh in 1531. He became a fellow of Queens' in 1516, and was president from 27 July 1528 to 1537. He had been ordained in February 1521, and on 28 November 1528 was admitted to the rectory of Barrow, Suffolk. In March 1530 he helped to secure his university's endorsement of Henry VIII's case for a divorce. In 1532&#150;4 he was vice-chancellor.<br>
<br>On 29 January 1535 Haynes was instituted to the vicarage of Stepney, Middlesex (held until 1537). In the same year he was an official anti-papal preacher in Cambridge and from August to December accompanied Christopher Mont on a special embassy to Paris. Haynes was immediately rewarded with the grant of a canonry of Windsor (21 December 1535). On 6 April 1537 the king further nominated him to the deanery of Exeter, vacant and in the crown's gift by the deprivation of Reginald Pole. The conservative chapter objected to Haynes's appointment, and controversy at once arose over its technicalities. He became, as was necessary, first a canon on 21 June, and was elected dean on 16 July. On 27 July he also obtained the rectory of Fulham, Middlesex (held until his death). Quarrels with the Exeter chapter over his rights and emoluments, and about liturgical customs he wished to abolish, were temporarily composed in January 1538. From April to August that year Haynes went (in the unlikely company of the staunchly conservative Edmund Bonner) on a mission to Charles V in Spain, with the hope of dissuading the emperor from attending a general council which might unite Catholic Europe against England. Also in 1538 he acquired the rectory of Newton Ferrers, Devon (which he held until his death). He was also master of St Anthony's Hospital, London.<br>
<br>Haynes had already diagnosed the south-west as &#145;perilous&#146; country and its clergy as unlearned, few of them &#145;well persuaded&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/2, no. 557). Now, as the king's commissioner, he set about preaching reform and destroying images throughout the diocese of Exeter. He made a few converts among the citizens of Exeter itself, but was for the most part, in the words of John Hooker, &#145;marvellous hated and maligned at&#146;  (Whiting, 75). In his cathedral he caused particular outrage by despoiling the tomb of the revered Bishop Edmund Lacy. In April 1539 he became a member of the short-lived council of the west. Throughout the 1530s he drafted reformist schemes: in 1537 at the time of the compiling of the <span class="roman">Bishops' Book</span>, and in 1539 when he noted what he might have said in parliament against the <span class="roman">Six Articles Bill</span>. He also planned to replace the Exeter chapter with a body of preachers, and to make the cathedral more of an academic college with university links. In some ways this anticipated the new cathedral foundations of the 1540s. To one of these, Westminster, Haynes was appointed canon in the foundation charter of 17 December 1540. He was given one of the best houses, and was regularly resident. He was also active at Windsor, and investigation into suspected heresies there in 1543 brought him before the privy council on 15 March. He was committed to the Fleet the following day, and renewed complaints against him from the Exeter chapter were simultaneously investigated. He was released on 5 July without charge, but was reprimanded for &#145;sowing &hellip; many erroniows opinions&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1542&#150;7</i>, 150).<br>
<br>In Edward VI's reign Haynes was increasingly employed: in 1547 as justice of the peace for Devon and visitor of the cathedral and diocese of Exeter, and in Lord Northampton's divorce case, in 1549 as visitor of Oxford University and the colleges of Windsor and Winchester, and in 1549 and 1551 on the heresy commissions. He may have had some hand in the 1549 prayer book; he was certainly sent back to the west in the aftermath of the disorders this provoked. But he was now more often at Westminster, where as treasurer he found economic as well as religious motives for disposing of church ornaments. As soon as clerical marriage was permitted (1549) he took Joan (<i>d</i>. 1587), daughter of Nicholas Wallron, as his wife. Their elder son, Joseph, was born in the following year; for him and his younger brother, Simon, their father mapped out a detailed educational curriculum (for the most part achieved, since they both went to Cambridge). Haynes made his will on 12 July 1552 and was dead by 24 October. He bequeathed lands at and near Mildenhall, Suffolk, which was probably his birthplace. His widow married first William May, dean of St Paul's, who died in 1560, and then Thomas Yale, dean of arches; she died on 12 September 1587.<br>
