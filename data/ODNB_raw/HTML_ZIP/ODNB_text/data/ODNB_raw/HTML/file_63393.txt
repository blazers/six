<span class="headword">Leighton,  Charles Blair</span>  (1823&#150;1855), <span class="occ">artist and printer</span>, was born on 6 March 1823, the son of Stephen Leighton and Helen Blair. From the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a silver-engraver but after serving his seven-year training he opted for a change of career. He had always devoted his spare time to drawing and was evidently gifted as he was accepted as a student at the Royal Academy. From his early twenties, in 1843, until the year before his death he practised as an artist and sent more than twenty paintings to the Royal Academy exhibitions, and several others to the British Institution in 1853 and 1855 from his home in Red Lion Square, Holborn, London. Given his commitment to the human figure and his time spent studying anatomy, his greatest strength was in figure painting and consequently most of the subjects he executed were either portraits or history paintings of literary and biblical subjects, such as <span class="italic">Moses Raising the Brazen Serpent</span> (1843) or <span class="italic">The Assassination of Richard III</span> (1843). Charles Blair Leighton enjoyed modest success as an artist but the most outstanding artist in the family was Edmund Blair Leighton (1853&#150;1922), his son with his wife, Caroline Boosey, daughter of the music publisher Thomas Boosey. Elected to the Institute of Painters in Oil Colours in 1887, he too was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, where he exhibited genre and figure paintings almost annually between 1878 and 1904.<br>
<br>Charles Leighton and his younger brother <a name="cosubject_63393"></a><span class="headword">George Cargill Leighton</span>  (1826&#150;1895) were most prominent as <span class="occ">publishers of colour prints</span>, trading as the Leighton Brothers. George Leighton was born in 1826, and was indentured to the wood-engraver George Baxter (1804&#150;1867) when he was only ten years old. This apprenticeship was to prove especially influential to the young Leighton's career. Not only did Baxter specialize in colour book illustrations but he was a pioneer of colour woodblock print technology. In 1835 he patented a new technique for oil colour printing where the key design was transferred from a single intaglio print and the colour developed by individual woodblocks, inked with an oil colour. As this resulted in highly nuanced &#145;prints of subtle colouring and minute detail&#146;  (Engen, <span class="italic">Wood Engravers</span>, 25) Baxter christened this technique &#145;picture-printing&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1843, after finishing his seven-year indenture, George Leighton joined several other of Baxter's pupils to establish a colour printing company named Gregory, Collins, and Reynolds. They were one of a number of firms to employ Baxter's patented technique under licence. In 1849, after the three partners went their separate ways, George went into partnership with his brother Charles and the firm continued under the name Leighton Brothers, at 19 Lamb's Conduit Street. On 19 April he married Margaret, daughter of Robert Faraday, at St Pancras register office. It was also in this year that Baxter's patent expired. When he filed for its renewal, his former pupil Leighton contested this, stating that he had a right to employ the same technique and that using it under licence was diminishing his livelihood. Even if his motives were entirely self-interested, the fact that Leighton fought this case in court single-handedly and without any legal aid is an indication of his confidence and resolve. He was, however, unsuccessful in his petition and Baxter won the case. Consequently Leighton was no longer able to employ Baxter's methods of printing intaglio plates with woodblocks and, according to Ruari McLean, having to do without this facility &#145;probably helped to ensure his commercial success&#146;  (McLean, 191). In contrast, Leighton Brothers specialized in colour printing from numerous separate colour plates whose careful registration they ensured. Such was the quality of their results that in 1851 they exhibited at the Great Exhibition; they also won a commission to produce colour plates for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>. Moving to premises at 4 Red Lion Square in 1852, over the following years they produced subtle and splendidly coloured plates for a number of volumes where the colour was essential to the success of the book. For example, in 1853, they illustrated <span class="italic">The Poultry Book</span>, a serious work on the breeding of poultry with &#145;vivid portraits&#146;  (ibid., 192) of these birds. They also produced the plates for various other art and illustrated books including George Barnard's <span class="italic">Landscape Painting</span> (1854) and Harriet Martineau's <span class="italic">The English Lakes</span> (1858).<br>
<br>Following Charles Blair Leighton's death on 6 February 1855 at Kingsland, Middlesex, George became a regular printer of colour plates for the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. This was a fortunate move as only two years later Leighton became its publisher until the year before his retirement, in 1884. Of consistently high quality, his coloured plates of flowers, birds, and domestic animals along with the intricate and brightly coloured covers were undoubtedly integral to the success of the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>.<br>
<br>From Stanhope House, a factory in Drury Lane, George Leighton continued to produce art-quality illustrations for a variety of publications including <span class="italic">Gems of English Art</span> (1869). Later in his career he was also associated with a number of attractively illustrated children's books. Indeed, in 1885, when he sold up the business to the lithographers Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son, he passed over the colour woodblocks for Warren and Routledge's <span class="roman">Toy Book</span> series to the wood-engraver Edmund Evans.<br>
<br>George Cargill Leighton died at his home, Fairlight, Shepherd's Hill, in Highgate, Middlesex, on 8 May 1895.<br>
