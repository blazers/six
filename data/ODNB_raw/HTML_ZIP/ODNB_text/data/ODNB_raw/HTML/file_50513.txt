<span class="headword">Laycock,  Samuel</span>  (1826&#150;1893), <span class="occ">dialect poet</span>, was born on 17 January 1826 at Intake Head, Pule Hill, Marsden, Yorkshire, the third of the four children of John Laycock (1791&#150;1861), a hand-loom weaver, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> France (1791&#150;1860). The family worshipped at Buckley Hill Independent Chapel, Marsden, and Laycock's only formal education was at the Sunday school and a few months at the minister's school. He started work, aged nine, in a woollen mill. In 1837 the family moved to Stalybridge, Cheshire, where Laycock worked as a cotton weaver, then as a foreman cut-looker. He married Martha Broadbent (<i>b</i>. 1828), a cotton weaver, on 9 December 1850, but she died two years later, and he remarried on 30 October 1858; his new wife was Hannah Woolley (1837&#150;1863).<br>
<br>Laycock began to write poetry while working in the mill, his first published work being a broadsheet in 1855. The cotton famine (1861&#150;5) left him unemployed and gave him the time and incentive to write while providing a market for his broadsheet poems. Other unemployed cotton workers set them to music and sang in the streets for spare coppers. This success encouraged Laycock to publish two books, <span class="italic">Lancashire Rhymes</span> (1864) and <span class="italic">Lancashire Songs</span> (1866). These poems, recording the everyday life of cotton workers, are his best.<br>
<br>The death of Hannah in 1863 left Laycock with several young children, including John Edward (<i>b</i>. 1859) and Hannah, later Mrs Schofield (1863&#150;1939), and he became unsettled, taking a range of different, unsuccessful, jobs while his already poor health further declined. His fortunes changed with his third marriage in June 1864 to Eliza Pontefract (1836&#150;1917), as she took an important role in supporting the family. Laycock then became the librarian at Stalybridge Mechanics' Institute in 1865, and at Whitworth Institute, Fleetwood, in 1867. After a year the family moved to Blackpool, eventually settling in Foxhall Road where Eliza ran a lodging-house and confectioner's shop while Laycock worked as a photographer (retired by 1881). They had at least two more children, Bertha, later Mrs Bowness (<i>b</i>. 1870) and Arthur (1869&#150;1957) who became a Labour councillor and novelist. Laycock published a collection of poems, <span class="italic">Warblin's fro' an Owd Songster</span>, just before his death from bronchitis on 15 December 1893 at his home, 48 Foxhall Road, Blackpool. He was buried in Layton cemetery, Blackpool, on 18 December. His <span class="italic">Collected Writings</span> was edited by George Milner and published in 1908.<br>
