<span class="headword">Williams,  Charles Eryl  Wynn-</span>  (1903&#150;1979), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 5 March 1903 at Glasfryn, Uplands, Swansea, the elder child of William Williams (1863&#150;1945), a physics teacher and later divisional inspector of schools for north and mid-Wales, and his wife, Mary Ellen, known as Nell (1873&#150;1935), daughter of Robert Wynn, a shopkeeper at Llanrwst. Named Charles Eryl Wynn Williams at birth, he adopted the surname Wynn-Williams while at university and used it consistently thereafter. He was educated at Grove Park School, Wrexham, and from 1920 at the University College of North Wales, Bangor. After graduation in 1923 he remained at Bangor to undertake research work on electrical instrumentation, obtaining the degree of MSc (Wales) in 1924.<br>
<br>With the award of a University of Wales open fellowship Wynn-Williams entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1925 and initially continued his researches on short electric waves at the Cavendish Laboratory under the supervision of Sir Ernest Rutherford; he was awarded the degree of PhD for this work in 1929. His most significant work in this period, however, was in the development of electronic instrumentation for use in radioactivity and nuclear physics. A dedicated wireless enthusiast, in 1926 he employed his skills in valve technique and electronic circuitry to construct a valve based amplifier for the measurement of very small electrical currents. It was quickly realized that such devices could be used to detect and count subatomic particles in the nuclear disintegration experiments then being undertaken by Rutherford and his deputy James Chadwick. Encouraged by Rutherford, Wynn-Williams began to devote his attention to the construction of a reliable valve amplifier and methods of registering and counting particles.<br>
<br>A series of brilliant contributions to the armamentarium of nuclear physics followed. In 1929&#150;30, with H. M. Cave and F. A. B. Ward he designed and constructed a counting device using thyratron valves in conjunction with a mechanical counter. By 1931 a valve amplifier and thyratron based automatic counting system were in regular use in the Cavendish Laboratory, the former playing an important part in James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932 and numerous other experiments. In 1932 Wynn-Williams published details of his thyratron based scale-of-two counter which allowed particles to be counted at much higher rates than previous instruments. His devices opened up new avenues of research in nuclear physics, and were widely copied (often with readily given advice from Wynn-Williams himself) in laboratories in Europe and the United States; they became crucial unifying elements in the hardware of the emergent discipline.<br>
<br>In 1935 Wynn-Williams was appointed assistant lecturer in physics at Imperial College, London. Continuing his work on electronic instrumentation he contributed to the development of nuclear physics at Imperial under G. P. Thomson. On the eve of the Second World War, Wynn-Williams, like many of his contemporaries, was recruited to work on radio direction finding (radar). However, his mastery of valves and circuits and his connections with government and industrial researchers soon drew him into the development of code breaking machines. He was seconded to the government communications headquarters at Bletchley Park, where he and a team of Post Office engineers made fundamental contributions to the development of machines for deciphering Enigma messages and to the Heath Robinson cryptanalytic device, forerunner of the Colossus decoding machine. This equipment proved decisive in the war effort and formed the basis for the development of modern digital electronics and computing.<br>
<br>Returning to Imperial College after the war Wynn-Williams devoted himself largely to the development of undergraduate teaching, where he was an accomplished and much liked instructor. He became lecturer and ultimately reader in physics at Imperial. In 1957 he received the Physical Society's Duddell medal in recognition of his work on the scale-of-two counter. Though he never received official recognition for his wartime work Wynn-Williams always observed the oath of secrecy surrounding it, and retained an interest in codes and puzzles throughout his life.<br>
<br>Liberal in politics and a fluent Welsh speaker, Wynn-Williams married a schoolteacher, Annie Eiluned James (<i>b</i>. 1907/8), on 12 August 1943 in London; they had two sons. He and his wife moved to Wales after his retirement in 1970. He died at his home, Bryn Elmen, Dolybont, Borth, Cardiganshire, on 30 August 1979. Cremation took place at Shrewsbury on 6 September.<br>
