<span class="headword">Baker,  Charles</span>  (1803&#150;1874), <span class="occ">teacher of deaf people</span>, was born on 31 July 1803, the second son of Thomas Baker, headmaster of the Lancasterian School, Severn Street, Birmingham, and his wife, Charlotte Mould. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1113/', "Franklin Baker (1800&#150;1867)")</script>; his younger brothers included Sir Thomas Baker (1810&#150;1886), a solicitor in Manchester, and Alfred Baker (1815&#150;1893), a surgeon in Birmingham. His sister Harriet (1805&#150;1850) was the mother of Edward White Benson, archbishop of Canterbury. While a youth he was for a short time an assistant at the Deaf and Dumb Institution at Edgbaston, near Birmingham, a pioneering provincial school for deaf children. He then tried other employment, but his services were again sought by the committee of the institution in 1826, when a difficulty arose because of the failure of the master, who was a Swiss, to control the pupils. Baker had never contemplated teaching as a profession, but without much thought for the future he entered upon his work. He at once gained the affections of the children and he remained at the institution. Three years later he was invited to help in the establishment, at Doncaster, of a deaf and dumb institution for the county of York. The plan had originated with the Revd William Fenton, rector of Cowthorpe, in company with whom he visited all the large towns of the county, and obtained sufficient support to warrant carrying out the scheme.<br>
<br>Baker then faced a lack of suitable books, for although institutions for the deaf and dumb had existed for forty years, no attempt had been made to provide a suitable course of instruction. He therefore set himself to supply this want. He wrote a graded reading and comprehension course, the <span class="italic">Circle of Knowledge</span>, consisting of consecutive lessons, with accompanying material for teachers, a graded series of books about <span class="roman">Bible</span> characters, events, and history, and many other works of special relevance to the teaching of deaf and deaf mute people. The <span class="italic">Circle of Knowledge</span>, which sold over 400,000 copies, was used in the education of the royal children, and of the grandchildren of King Louis-Philippe, and was widely used in the colonies and in Russia. The first gradation was translated into Chinese by the London Missionary Society, and was used in the schools of China and Japan. Baker produced many textbooks for <span class="roman">Bible</span> classes. He also contributed to the <span class="italic">Penny Cyclop&aelig;dia</span>, the <span class="italic">Journal of Education</span>, the <span class="italic">Polytechnic Journal</span>, and the publications of the Central Society of Education, and translated J. C. Amman's <span class="italic">Dissertatio de loquela</span> (as <span class="italic">Dissertation on Speech</span>, 1873).<br>
<br>Baker was an active worker in connection with the local institutions of Doncaster, and was a member of the committee for the establishment of a free public library for the town. He was held in high regard by teachers of deaf people in England and in America, by whom he was acknowledged to be the leader of the older school of thought, which emphasized written methods of instruction. In June 1870 the Columbian Institution of the Deaf and Dumb conferred on him the degree of doctor of philosophy, an honour which he appreciated, but he never assumed the title. He died at Doncaster on 27 May 1874, leaving a widow, Mary Baker (<i>b</i>. 1805/6), who was matron of the Doncaster institution. His will named five daughters and one son. His old pupils erected a mural tablet to his memory in the institution where he had laboured so long.<br>
