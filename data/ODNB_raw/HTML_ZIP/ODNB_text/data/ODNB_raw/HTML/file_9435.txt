<span class="headword">Finch,  Heneage</span>, first earl of Aylesford  (1648/9&#150;1719), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9433/', "Heneage Finch, first earl of Nottingham (1621&#150;1682)")</script>, and Elizabeth Harvey (<i>d</i>. 1675). He studied at Westminster School and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 18 November 1664, aged fifteen, and then pursued law in the Inner Temple. In 1673 Finch received his call to the bar, on 10 July 1677 was made king's counsel, and in 1678 became a bencher of the Inner Temple. Having established a prosperous practice, he moved into politics, though he failed in his first electoral effort, a parliamentary by-election for Leicester in early 1677. On 16 May 1678 Finch married Elizabeth Banks, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38265/', "Sir John Banks")</script>, a merchant and financier of Aylesford, Kent; they had nine children.<br>
<br>Charles II named Finch his solicitor-general on 13 January 1679 after dismissing Sir Francis Winnington from the post. Late in the following month, with the support of his father (now the lord chancellor), Humphrey Prideaux of Christ Church, and Dr John Fell, bishop of Oxford, the University of Oxford chose Finch as their member of parliament in a keenly contested election. Many thought Finch would become attorney-general after the resignation of Sir William Jones in October 1679, but Finch declined the offer, reportedly acting on his father's advice. Though one observer remarked early in 1680 that Finch &#145;is run high into the popular way&#146;  (Thompson, 1.224), he did not seek a parliamentary seat in late 1679 nor in 1681.<br>
<br>As solicitor Finch assisted Attorney-General Sir Robert Sawyer in many of the leading political prosecutions of the 1680s. He summed up the evidence in the treason trials of William, Lord Russell and Algernon Sidney, insisting that convictions would preserve &#145;the best government in the world, and the best and most unspotted religion &hellip; the greatest liberty, and the greatest security for property that ever was in any nation&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.631). But Burnet condemned Finch's arguments as more full of &#145;vicious eloquence, and of ingenious malice &hellip; than of solid or sincere reasoning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Burnet's History</span>, 2.376). Finch also pleaded the crown's case in the London <i>quo warranto</i> in 1683, and helped to convict Titus Oates of perjury in 1685.<br>
<br>With royal support Finch made an unsuccessful bid for a parliamentary seat at Newport, Isle of Wight, in 1685. Having bought the manor of Albury in Surrey in 1680, he found himself a seat at nearby Guildford, though questions arose about the legitimacy of his election. Finch proved energetic in the Commons, showing his support of the new king by helping to draft a loyal address after the duke of Monmouth's rebellion. Less loyally, he also chaired a committee that prepared an address opposing the appointment of Catholic officers. In April 1686 the king dismissed Finch as solicitor after he refused to pass a warrant for appointing a Catholic to the mastership of an Oxford college. Finch continued his support for the anti-Catholic cause, providing legal advice to prevent the grant of a Cambridge MA to a Benedictine. In 1688 he was one of the counsel who successfully defended the seven bishops, though Sir William Williams, who argued the king's case, tried to undermine Finch in court by his negative reflections on Finch's actions when he served in the same office Williams now held.<br>
<br>After James II fled in December 1688, Finch was consulted by the provisional government about the prevailing legal situation. The University of Oxford again chose Finch for a seat in the convention of 1689&#151;a seat which he retained until ennobled in 1703. Having argued throughout James's reign against the royal dispensing power, Finch now contended that the king's departure had not made the throne vacant. Still feeling bound by his oath of allegiance to James, he recommended a regency rather than the grant of the crown to William and Mary.<br>
<br>Rumours in the early 1690s suggested that Finch might be given the great seal, either as lord keeper, or as a commissioner of the seal in 1692, but this did not happen. In the Commons he frequently spoke against crown interests. In 1696, when parliament approved the new association oath after a plot against William III, Finch apologized for being one of the eighty-nine members who refused to swear it. In 1701, in the debate on the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span>, Finch again showed his discomfort with the revolution of 1688 when he spoke against a clause for abjuring the prince of Wales. Finch also promoted a bill against occasional conformity in early 1703.<br>
<br>Most of Finch's house at Albury was destroyed by fire in 1697, but this loss was made up two years later when he inherited property at Aylesford from his father-in-law. Queen Anne made him Baron Guernsey in 1703; from 1703 until 1708 Finch served on the privy council, returning again to council service in 1711. Despite his long-standing tory ideals, Finch embraced the Hanoverian succession, retained his council seat in 1714, and was created earl of Aylesford and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster soon after the arrival of George I. He died on 22 July 1719 and was buried at Aylesford.<br>
