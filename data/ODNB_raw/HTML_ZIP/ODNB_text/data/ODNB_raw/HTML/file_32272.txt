<span class="headword">Campbell,  (Renton) Stuart</span>  (1908&#150;1966), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in Kensal Rise, London, on 4 June 1908, the third child of John Campbell, a printer's manager from Scotland, and his wife, Florence Harmsworth. He was educated at Lavender Hill School and at Wandsworth Technical Institute Secondary School. Encouraged by his father he quickly embarked on a career in newspapers, starting as a junior reporter on the <span class="italic">Hendon and Finchley Times</span>, from which he went on to the <span class="italic">Woking Gazette</span> and the <span class="italic">Nottingham Guardian</span>. He was still a reporter when in 1933 he moved to the Manchester office of the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> and then, in 1935, to the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> in London. In that year he also married Joan Mary Algernon (<i>d</i>. 1977), of Nottingham, with whom he had one daughter. In 1937 he was appointed assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span> under Hugh Cudlipp. From then on he was a Sunday newspaperman of the watchdog breed.<br>
<br>When Cudlipp joined the forces early in the Second World War, Campbell became editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Pictorial</span>. The paper was already making a name as a campaigner for populist causes, and Campbell developed that reputation. The <span class="italic">Pictorial</span> took up many issues on behalf of soldiers and their families and investigated numerous complaints of profiteering. Campbell trained his reporters in the art of detecting, trapping, and exposing ration dodgers, oppressive landlords, petrol thieves, and other villains of the home front. It was a role he relished as an ardent, although undogmatic, socialist and as a passionate believer in the journalist as crusader. Libel actions were an inevitable hazard and in the course of fighting them Campbell acquired considerable legal agility.<br>
<br>Cudlipp's return to the <span class="italic">Pictorial</span> in 1946 meant that Campbell was an editor without a newspaper. But he was quickly promised the editorship of the <span class="italic">People</span>, a Sunday newspaper owned by Odhams Press. The paper was then edited by Harry Ainsworth, who was soon due to retire. In the meantime Campbell became managing editor, running the paper without interference save for timid occasional grumbles from Ainsworth. The grumbles arose because Campbell systematically removed or transformed editorial features which he regarded as almost criminally soporific and out of date, replacing them with his own brand of sharp, topical, combative reporting and comment. Within two years, having also completely redesigned the <span class="italic">People</span>'s layout and typography, Campbell had a newspaper which, in his view, would appeal to a new post-war generation far more demanding than their parents of entertainment, sensation, and information. He retained one highly successful feature of the old <span class="italic">People</span>, its confession series written by, or ghosted for, the famous and the notorious. But Campbell's confessionals were often those of obscure people, whose experiences somehow reflected the unacknowledged hopes or fears of his readers. He was a master of the telling headline that sold these articles, for example: &#145;I took a lorry ride to shame&#146;, &#145;I was a G.I.'s slave bride&#146;, and &#145;Because my skin is black&#146;.<br>
<br>It was, however, in the investigation and exposure of criminal and social wrongdoing that Campbell put his distinctive stamp on popular journalism. Disclosure has always been the business of newspapers. Campbell went a stage further for he not only printed the results of his reporters' enquiries but he also produced the evidence on which those conclusions were based. Thus when in 1950 the <span class="italic">People</span> disclosed that the Messina brothers were running an empire of prostitution in London his reporter, Duncan Webb, set out the whole course of his investigation, showing how he had traced the women to their various addresses and had established their links with the gang exploiting them. It was a pattern that Campbell followed with equal success in exposures of bribery among footballers, slum landlordism, fake religions, and numerous other social scandals. His techniques were adopted by other newspapers, especially the &#145;quality Sundays&#146;. All of them, like the <span class="italic">People</span> itself, gained in circulation as a result.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">People</span>'s success was also due to its highly personal flavour. It spoke with one voice&#151;Campbell's. He wrote or rewrote a great part of the paper himself. Reporters' and even columnists' copy was often no more to him than raw material for moulding by the master. His immediate assistants caught Campbell's tone, and articles which he did not have time to edit himself came out with his accent. The note was often strident, especially when evil was being denounced. Articles usually carried black and white moral judgements; as a journalist Campbell knew no greys and, as a stern Caledonian by upbringing, he tended to hark back to hellfire. Campbell did not even leave sport to the experts. He often edited sporting features and constantly briefed sports columnists. His own regular contribution to the paper was the &#145;Man o' the people&#146; column, for a time written by Gilbert Harding. In it he and Harding produced miniature expos&eacute;s of the type carried on other pages, often campaigning on behalf of victims of officialdom. Campbell encouraged Harding to start an annual Christmas appeal for charities, which was remarkably successful and remained a feature of the paper that Campbell always cherished.<br>
<br>In 1957 Campbell succeeded Ainsworth as editor. The change meant little. He had been in effective command of the paper for years and remained so until his death. But his elevation did, for the first time in his professional life, give him an uneasy place in the journalists' establishment. From 1961 to 1964 he was a member of the Press Council, whose occasional strictures on his editorial methods he had often scorned. He believed in getting &#145;the story&#146;, even if in the getting he sometimes violated the Press Council canon. But he did come to realize, under his colleagues' influence, the need to improve standards of taste and responsibility in popular newspapers.<br>
<br>Accused more than once as an editor of invasion of privacy, away from his newspaper Campbell was himself a very private man. When he went home to Stella Cottage, near Farnham, where the Stella of Jonathan Swift once lived, he practised family seclusion. Always approachable in office hours by staff and visitors alike, he discouraged callers to his home. Once, when acquaintances were walking around the house in the hope of finding him in, he lay prone on the kitchen floor for half an hour to avoid detection, reading a book. He read, gardened, and fished enthusiastically. But his passion was newspapers. He died at Stella Cottage on 1 February 1966 and was cremated at Aldershot on 7 February.<br>
