<span class="headword">Varley,  Cornelius</span>  (1781&#150;1873), <span class="occ">landscape painter and inventor of optical apparatus</span>, was born on 21 November 1781 at the Blue Post tavern in Mare Street, Hackney, the third of five children of Richard Varley (<i>d</i>. 1791) and his second wife, Hannah Fleetwood, a descendant of General Charles Fleetwood and Oliver Cromwell's daughter Bridget. When Varley was ten years old his father died leaving the family inadequately provided for, and the large house in Hackney was vacated for a dark court opposite St Luke's Hospital in Old Street. Varley's elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28115/', "John Varley (1778&#150;1842)")</script>, became a famous watercolour artist, a profession also taken up by his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28116/', "William Fleetwood Varley (1785&#150;1856)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28115/', "Varley, John (1778&#150;1842)")</script>], and his younger sister, Elizabeth, who married the artist William Mulready in 1803. Two years after his father's death, Cornelius's uncle Samuel Varley, a watchmaker, jeweller, and natural philosopher, took charge of him. Varley later wrote in his autobiography that it was his uncle who opened his eyes to the wonders of science. Cornelius began to make lenses and microscopes and assisted his uncle in his chemical experiments and public lectures when the latter founded the Chemical and Philosophical Society at Hatton House in 1794, one of the forerunners of the Royal Institution. In 1800, however, Samuel Varley gave up his own business and the Hatton House lectures to work for Charles, third Earl Stanhope, and Cornelius Varley determined to become an artist like his elder brother. Instead of undergoing another apprenticeship, he taught himself by sketching from nature in the company of his brother John with whom he lived at Charles Street, Covent Garden. John introduced Cornelius to the influential patron of watercolour artists, Thomas Monro. Through Monro, Varley met George, fifth earl of Essex, who recommended him to his first students.<br>
<br>Within a year of the start of his new career Varley was invited to teach the Bacon Schutz family at Gillingham Hall, Norfolk, and the Rous family at Henham Hall in Suffolk. After spending the winter of 1801&#150;2 in Suffolk he returned to London to teach drawing and perspective. In June 1802 Varley travelled to north Wales with his brother John and Thomas Webster (1772&#150;1844), a young architect who was later to become a prominent member of the Geological Society of London. He returned to Wales in 1803 with the artists Joshua Cristall and William Havell and again on his own in 1805. His sketches from these trips and another to St Albans in 1804 constitute some of his most significant output. Rather than showing a concern for one single impression or the construction of a successfully controlled pictorial space, they concentrate on the detailed observation of different landscape features as they appear at a particular moment rendered in colour on the spot. During and after his lifetime these works were not valued. In a review of the sale of Varley's work at Christies, the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> of 16 July 1875 saw little interest in the sketches, stating that &#145;we have got far beyond such work as his&#146;. In the second half of the twentieth century, however, his work became appreciated for its freshness and its role in pioneering a &#145;naturalistic&#146; mode of landscape depiction. The rediscovery of his drawings in the family's collection in the early 1970s finally opened up a new assessment. Varley's early watercolour drawings, such as <span class="italic">Ross Market Place, Herefordshire</span> (V&amp;A), one of his earliest exhibits, shown in 1805 at the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96320', "Society of Painters in Water Colours (SPWC)")</script> (of which Varley was a founding member), are remarkable for their attention to detail and to changing atmospheric effects.<br>
<br>Yet most of the works Varley exhibited publicly in the first two decades of the century bear poetic titles that indicate their more conventionally idealistic character. He exhibited work at the Royal Academy from 1803, and at the SPWC after its foundation in 1804. Varley did not sell many works in exhibitions, however. In 1809 he published a series of etchings and lithographs entitled <span class="italic">Shipping, barges, fishing boats, and other vessels, commonly met with on the British coasts, rivers and canals</span> which does not seem to have been a great success, and only the first part was published. Although in 1819 the SPWC awarded him one of its first three prizes for the encouragement of the production of important work, Varley's main occupation from 1814 was once again as an optical manufacturer.<br>
<br>In 1809 Varley invented the graphic telescope, a drawing instrument which combined the portability of the camera obscura with the two-way mirror arrangement of William Hyde Wollaston's camera lucida. Its much improved lens system allowed it to be used for objects or views of greatly varying size and distance. Varley patented the graphic telescope in 1811, but found that manufacturers were not able to work to his exacting specifications; this was perhaps a reason why he set up his own workshop. He had, however, never entirely abandoned his scientific interests after leaving his uncle's house. From 1804 until 1844 his name appears on many engraved illustrations in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Society of Arts</span>, and he became a full member of the society in 1814. In 1807 and 1809 he contributed to the emerging science of meteorology by publishing two articles on atmospheric phenomena in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, based on observations collected during his sketching trips to Wales in 1803 and 1805. He also became involved in the City Philosophical Society where he met the scientist Michael Faraday. After Faraday's election as director of the laboratories at the Royal Institution, Varley was invited to lecture there on the graphic telescope in 1826, and again during the 1830s, returning annually between 1838 and 1861.<br>
<br>In 1821 Varley married Elizabeth Livermore Straker, a cousin of Faraday's own future wife. They had three daughters and seven sons, two of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28114/', "Cromwell Fleetwood Varley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54082/', "Frederick Henry Varley")</script>, became eminent as electrical engineers. Through the artist John Linnell's <span class="italic">Journals</span> (vol. 1, FM Cam.) we know that Varley attended the services of the Revd John Martin at the Baptist church at Keppel Street, Bloomsbury, about 1811. He was a member of the Sandemanian sect from 1833 to 1847.<br>
<br>In 1839 Varley co-founded the Royal Microscopic Society and contributed a series of communications to its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>. In contrast to his work as an artist, he achieved recognition during his lifetime for developing optical instruments, receiving two silver medals from the Society of Arts in 1831 and in 1833, as well as an Isis gold medal for improvements in the construction of microscopes in 1841. Varley's distinction as a manufacturer was acknowledged when he and his sons mounted a display at the Great Exhibition in 1851. He was awarded a prize medal for his graphic telescope and its supporting table which by then had come to be widely used by artists such as John Sell Cotman and the land surveyor Thomas Hornor (1785&#150;1844) when, in 1820, the latter drew his great panorama of London from St Paul's Cathedral for the Colosseum in Regent's Park. In 1845 Varley published a <span class="italic">Treatise on Optical Drawing Instruments</span>. He never, however, entirely gave up his work as an artist and continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1859, at Suffolk Street, and four times at the British Institution between 1815 and 1840. Not many pictures produced after 1814 are known to have survived, but the few that are, together with the titles given in the exhibition catalogues, show that the split between composed works bearing poetic titles and detailed topographical studies continued into his later life. A photograph taken of Varley in the studio of the family towards the end of his life shows a small man of stocky build with a white beard, deep-set eyes, and bushy eyebrows. Throughout his life he regularly attended scientific meetings and soir&eacute;es. He was known for his range of knowledge, wide interests, and rapid speech. He died at 19 South Grove West, Stoke Newington, London, on 2 October 1873, at the age of nearly ninety-two years. Examples of his work are to be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum and British Museum, London, Tate Collection, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.<br>
