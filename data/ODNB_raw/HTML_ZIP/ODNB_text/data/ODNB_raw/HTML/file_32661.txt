<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cullis,  Winifred Clara</span>  (1875&#150;1956), <span class="occ">physiologist and educationist</span>, was the younger daughter and the fifth of the six children of Frederick John Cullis (1842&#150;1931), surveyor and civil engineer of the Gloucester Dock Company, and his wife, Louisa, daughter of John Corbett of Coombe Hill. She was born in Stroud Road, South Hamlet, Gloucester, on 2 June 1875. The Cullis family had lived in Gloucestershire for three hundred years, but moved to Birmingham in 1880, as it offered better educational facilities. Winifred, a lively, generous, and considerate child, learned to read so quickly that her elder brother Cuthbert lost half his fee for teaching her. At the King Edward VI High School for Girls she was known for her outstanding academic ability and for her beautiful speaking voice. Extra tuition in science was obtained for Winifred at Mason College, where a demonstrator threatened to leave as he considered that &#145;it was indecent for a girl to study biology&#146;. She entered Newnham College, Cambridge, as Sidgwick scholar in 1896, taking a second in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1899 and 1900), and her MA in 1927. She was elected associate of Newnham College (1919&#150;33) and president of the college roll (1952&#150;5). She obtained the DSc of London in 1908, and the LLD <i>honoris causa</i> was conferred on her by Vassar College, New York, USA (1919), Goucher College, Maryland, USA (1931), and Birmingham University (1955).<br>
<br>Winifred Cullis's most influential teachers were her headmistress, Miss Creak, who believed that children should be given time &#145;to browse, read and think&#146;, J. N. Langley, and F. G. Hopkins. In 1901 she assisted T. G. Brodie in the research laboratory of the Royal College of Surgeons and of the Royal College of Physicians, London, and also taught as a part-time instructor in elementary science in a private school for girls. Later that year she was appointed demonstrator in physiology at the London School of Medicine for Women, Langley having written of her sound qualifications, hard and judicious work, independent thought, accuracy, and skill. Successively she was appointed co-lecturer with Brodie (1903&#150;8); part-time lecturer and head of department (1908); full-time lecturer and head of department, with conferment of title as university reader in physiology (1912); and professor (1919). She was the first woman professor in a British medical school and the second in the country. In 1926 she became the first holder of the Sophia Jex-Blake chair of physiology, retiring as professor emeritus in 1941. When Brodie died (1916), the University of Toronto invited her to be the acting professor of physiology, pending the appointment of a successor. Apart from that year's secondment, she served the School of Medicine for Women throughout her life, even attending an important meeting the day before she died.<br>
<br>Winifred Cullis's original work included investigation of mechanisms of secretion of urine, perfusion of the isolated mammalian heart, and the effects of fatigue on factory workers. Among those with whom she published papers were W. E. Dixon and W. D. Halliburton. Her greatest contributions were to education, the application of science to healthy living, including sport, and the fostering of international goodwill and the emancipation of both sexes through education. She wrote <span class="italic">The Body and its Health</span> with Muriel Bond (1935), and <span class="italic">Your Body and the Way it Works</span> (1949).<br>
<br>Winifred Cullis taught with lucidity, robust humour, enthusiasm, and mastery of the subject. Always nervous beforehand, she sounded at ease whether lecturing to students, broadcasting, or addressing an audience in the Albert Hall. Integrity, warmth, charm, simple but accurate explanations, and the ability to set people at ease, made her a memorable teacher. In 1919 she lectured to troops in Gibraltar and Malta for the Colonial Office, and was appointed OBE, being promoted CBE in 1929. In 1940&#150;41 she travelled thousands of miles, lecturing on wartime Britain in China, Japan, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. From 1941 to 1943 she directed the women's section of the British information services in New York, and in 1944&#150;5 lectured in the Middle East, mainly to the Royal Air Force.<br>
<br>Speaking commitments curtailed Winifred Cullis's research, but extended her influence on national and international affairs. She believed that the essential need in the social system was to see that every person had an opportunity for making use of the capacities that were in them, and that education should give the ability to exercise ingenuity and &#145;determine values in the spiritual and moral life of the community&#146;. In her opinion, teaching the applications of science to responsible daily living should begin at school, because they were keys to health and the prevention of disease. Biology teaching &#145;should not be given to the least busy member of staff&#146;, but to trained teachers, and &#145;it should not end at the waist&#146;. She instituted courses for teachers of physical education and ballet in schools of the London county council. She broadcast on &#145;Health and common sense&#146;, and made educational films as aids, but not substitutes, for teachers.<br>
<br>Winifred Cullis's tact, regard for others, common sense, grasp of essentials, good humour, and wit made her an admirable committee member and chair and a persuasive opponent. Apart from university, medical school, and hospital committees, she served on the clinical management committee of the Institute of Child Psychology, the council of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, the fatigue research board of the Medical Research Council, and the Home Office committee on the two-shift system for women and young persons. Her concerns also embraced the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Trades Union Congress committee on scientific planning of industry, the Central Council of Recreative Physical Training, the King Edward VII Hospital Fund, the BBC Council for Adult Education, and the governing bodies of the Royal Academy of Dancing and Chelsea Polytechnic. She was chairman of the British Film Institute's educational panel, and from 1951 until her death, deputy chairman of the English-Speaking Union. She was also a director of <span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>.<br>
<br>A non-militant feminist, Winifred Cullis was amused by being exiled to galleries of lecture theatres in Cambridge and lecturers who addressed the mixed audience as &#145;Gentlemen&#146;. She overcame prejudice through firmness, good sense, ability, and integrity. She was one of the first women to be elected to the Physiological Society (1915), the first woman elected to the deputy chairmanship of convocation of London University and the only woman delegate from the British Association to attend the silver jubilee celebrations of the Indian Science Association. She was a co-founder of the British Federation of University Women, and the International Federation of University Women, and was president of each from 1925 to 1929 and from 1929 to 1932 respectively. The IFUW now awards Winifred Cullis grants for research.<br>
<br>Winifred Cullis was handsome, well built, and well dressed. Although lacking classical beauty, her features were noble, and her blue eyes were kindly and shrewd. She was serene, warm, and loved life and people. Unfailingly loyal, high-principled, but tolerant, courageous, and apparently tireless, she enjoyed indifferent health and slept little. She read widely and enjoyed the arts and cross stitch. She died on 13 November 1956 at her home, Vincent House, Pembridge Square, London.<br>
