<span class="headword">Stewart,  Anthony</span>  (1773&#150;1846), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was born at Crieff, Perthshire. Nothing is known of his parents, but he received a good education, and was &#145;bred to Landscape under&#146; Alexander Nasmyth of Edinburgh  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 201). His portrait of Nasmyth's wife, Barbara Foulis, is at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He produced many landscapes, sketches, and drawings of Scottish scenery but soon gave up painting landscapes in favour of miniatures.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1793, in St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh, Stewart married Janet Weir of Tron parish, the daughter of Alexander Weir, painter. He practised for a time in Edinburgh, then successfully established himself in London. On 17 June 1794 he was introduced to the landscape painter Joseph Farington by Caleb Whitefoord at the Shakspeare Gallery, London. In 1803 he was again in Edinburgh, living at 1 George Street, North Side, but when he exhibited works at the Royal Academy between 1807 and 1820 he gave his address as &#145;26, Prince's Square, St George's East&#146;, London  (Graves, <span class="italic">RA exhibitors</span>, 260).<br>
<br>Stewart was introduced to the royal family, and painted Princess Charlotte. He also painted miniatures of Queen Victoria as a child (<i>c</i>.1822 and <i>c</i>.1826; Royal Collection, Windsor; numerous copies, variously dated). An engraving by Thomas Woolnoth, after a miniature by Stewart of Princess Victoria &#145;in her ninth year&#146;, was published in 1832. Stewart often used light, clear colours with stippled backgrounds, and his sitters are shown full-face with distinctive bright eyes. He excelled in painting children, and for the last fifteen years of his life devoted himself almost exclusively to them; his portraits of adults were less effective. Among his miniatures still in family collections are four of the Methuen children, including Frederick Henry Paul, later second Baron Methuen of Corsham, and three of the children of Thomas Howard, thirteenth duke of Norfolk, including Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard, later the fourteenth duke (1827). His watercolour-on-ivory portraits of members of the Dalrymple and Fanshawe families are in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. In addition to several miniatures of unknown sitters, mostly children, and the portrait of Nasmyth's wife already mentioned, the Victoria and Albert Museum has a self-portrait miniature of Stewart. His portrait of Euphemia Murray (later Smith) was engraved by Henry Robinson for <span class="italic">The Works of Robert Burns</span> (1843; 2.22).<br>
<br>Stewart died at Crown Hill, Norwood, Surrey, on 20 November 1846, and was buried in Norwood cemetery. He taught his daughters Margaret and Grace to paint miniatures, and their work was considered good. <a name="cosubject_66815"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Seguier</span>  (1794/5&#150;1870)<span class="occ"></span>, the elder daughter, born in Edinburgh, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25044/', "John Seguier (1785&#150;1856)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25045/', "Seguier, William")</script>], a topographical landscape painter, picture restorer, and superintendent of the British Institution. Their son Frederick Peter Seguier (1836&#150;1902) was the author of <span class="italic">A Critical and Commercial Dictionary of the Works of Painters</span> (1870). Margaret Seguier died at Camden Street, London, on 23 April 1870. <a name="cosubject_66816"></a><span class="headword">Grace Campbell Stewart</span>  (1795/6&#150;1863)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Edinburgh, practised miniature painting in London, and exhibited fourteen of her works at the Royal Academy between 1843 and 1856, including individual portraits of three daughters and the son of John Scott, second earl of Eldon. She lived at various addresses in London; in 1856, the last year in which she exhibited at the Royal Academy, she was living at 10 Union Road, Clapham. She died at 35 Manor Street, Clapham, on 15 July 1863.<br>
