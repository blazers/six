<span class="headword">Dodd, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1652&#150;1716), <span class="occ">judge</span>, the son of Ralph Dodd, was from a Cheshire family settled at Little Budworth, but was born in London. He was probably the &#145;Samuel Dod&#146; who entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 11 September 1664. He entered the Inner Temple in 1670, was called to the bar in 1679, and became a bencher in 1700. On 11 March 1686 he married Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1722), daughter and coheir of Sir Robert Croke of Chequers, Buckinghamshire. They had two sons, only one of whom survived his father. Dodd was employed in 1693 and 1700 for the bankers against the government over the long-drawn-out case of the crown's liability for interest on loans made to Charles II. Commercial cases seem to have been something of a speciality, for Dodd was one of the lawyers chosen in 1694 to prepare the by-laws for the Bank of England and he played an important role in matters appertaining to the East India trade. In February 1700 he was counsel for the new company against a bill to incorporate the old company, and counsel for the new company again in June 1700. In October 1701 he acted for the new company in negotiations for uniting the two East India companies. He also appeared as counsel in cases before the House of Lords, such as representing the duchess of Norfolk against the divorce bill promoted by her husband.<br>
<br>In February 1710 Dodd was assigned as counsel for Dr Henry Sacheverell in his impeachment before the Lords. His speech on the first article of the impeachment followed that of Sir Simon Harcourt and was notable only for its length. Once Harcourt had been removed from the defence team following his return to parliament, Dodd usually took the lead in the defence team. However, his part in the trial did not damage his relations with the whigs. Indeed, he reached the apogee of his career shortly after the Hanoverian succession. When Lord Cowper advised George I on the appointment of the judges at the start of his reign he remarked that for the exchequer &#145;Mr Dodd, an ancient practiser of this court, is the fittest person to supply the place of Chief Baron, now void, and I must confess experience is requisite for this post above all others&#146;  (Holmes and Speck, 65). Dodd was knighted on 11 October 1714, appointed a serjeant-at-law on 26 October, his patrons on the latter occasion being lords Wharton and Somers, two of the leading whigs of the day, and created chief baron of the exchequer on 20 November. Dodd died on 14 April 1716 &#145;after a long indisposition, leaving behind him the reputation of a learned and eminent lawyer, and a plentiful fortune to his only son&#146;  (Boyer, 11.505). He was buried in the Temple Church on 20 April. There is a volume of his manuscript reports in the British Library's Hargrave collection; an edition by W. Hamilton Bryson appeared in 2000.<br>
