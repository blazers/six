<span class="headword">Seymour, Lady  Jane</span>  (1541&#150;1561), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset (c.1500&#150;1552)")</script>, lord protector of England in the minority of Edward VI, and thus the niece of Queen Jane Seymour. She was one of the ten children (six daughters, four sons) whom Seymour had with his fiercely protestant second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68053/', "Anne Seymour (c.1510&#150;1587)")</script>, herself a granddaughter of Thomas of Woodstock, youngest son of Edward III. Together with two of her sisters, <a name="cosubject_46921"></a><span class="headword">Lady Margaret Seymour</span>  (<em>b. </em>1540)<span class="occ"></span> and Anne Seymour [<a name="cosubject_46931"></a><span class="headword">Anne Dudley</span>, countess of Warwick  (1538&#150;1587)<span class="occ"></span>], she received a full humanist education, as did their brother Edward. The education of Jane, Anne, and Margaret seems to be directly connected with their father's political life. He was accused of plotting to marry Jane to her first cousin Edward VI, to which her princess-like education gives some credibility. The sisters were tutored by one John Crane, and then by a French humanist and Pl&eacute;iade poet in French and Latin, Nicholas Denisot. Their literary ambitions were known outside the family from an early age: Margaret and Jane wrote an undated letter (1548?) to Edward VI, thanking the young king for his &#145;literary gift&#146;, while a letter from Jane to Bucer and Fagius, in Latin, dated 12 June 1549 (when she was eight), thanks them for sending her and her sister books.<br>
<br>The three Seymour sisters seem to have resembled their near-contemporaries, the four daughters of Anthony Cooke, in being conscious of themselves as a group. Their claim to fame is that they collectively composed a collection of 103 Latin distichs for the tomb of Marguerite de Valois, author and queen of Navarre, edited by Denisot and published in Paris in 1550. Margaret, in the judgement of the French humanists, was the most talented. Their work was most respectfully received: the sisters were hailed with a long ode from Ronsard, while a distinguished list of French humanists contributed congratulatory poems to the volume itself. This reception of the sisters' little book is probably to be connected with the high visibility of their father: Ronsard, in another of his odes, celebrates Somerset as the architect of an Anglo-French peace treaty concluded on 24 March 1550, which left the French in possession of Boulogne. The <span class="italic">Hecatodistichon</span> ran to a second edition, produced in 1551, which shows some interesting differences. Each distich is followed by translations into Greek, Italian, and French, which has the effect of shifting the interest of the collection from the distichs themselves to the translation exercise which they have come to represent. However, the fact that this second edition includes French translations may indicate that the work was attracting genuine interest.<br>
<br>While the sisters were at work on the poem, their father was deposed from the office of lord protector on 14 January 1550. His formal rehabilitation on 10 April of that year was marked by a swiftly arranged marriage between his daughter Anne and John, Lord Lisle, son and heir of his principal enemy, John Dudley, earl of Warwick and duke of Northumberland, on 3 June. The marriage was nearly as brief as the alliance which created it: Lord Lisle was condemned with his father after the fall of Lady Jane Grey, and although Mary spared his life, he died a few days after his release from the Tower in 1554. Meanwhile, Somerset himself had been executed in January 1552. Nothing more is heard of Margaret (who had perhaps died), but Jane became a maid of honour at Mary's court, then at Elizabeth's, and was the prime mover in the disastrous marriage between her brother, Edward Seymour, and Lady Katherine Grey, though she died just before the scandal broke. Jane, in fact, was so entirely responsible for stage-managing the occasion that after her death no single witness to the wedding could be found, and no one knew where to locate the officiating clergyman. This marriage was perceived by Elizabeth as a bid for the succession; it probably was, since the Seymours had Plantagenet blood through their mother, while Lady Katherine was a granddaughter of Mary Tudor, queen of France, and the deeply protestant principles entertained by both sides suggest that the couple had a common interest in reviving the Edwardian religious settlement. Jane died in 1561 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where a monument was erected to her.<br>
<br>Anne, on the other hand, after only a year of widowhood, married a Berkshire gentleman, Sir Edward Unton, in 1555, rusticated at Faringdon, had seven children in ten years, and in 1566 &#145;fell into lunacy&#146;, though according to her son's later testimony, &#145;she enjoyed lucid intervals&#146;. She seems to have kept the title of countess of Warwick from her brief first marriage, since it is the name used in Chamberlaine's funeral sermon for her. She died in 1587, and was buried at Faringdon. No portrait from life is known, but her second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28001/', "Sir Henry Unton")</script>, is remembered by art historians for his memorial portrait (<i>c</i>.1596, National Portrait Gallery): a representation of his mother nursing him in infancy is shown on the bottom right.<br>
