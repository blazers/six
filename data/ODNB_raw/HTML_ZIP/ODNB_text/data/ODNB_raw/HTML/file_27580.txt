<span class="headword">Toup,  Jonathan</span>  (1713&#150;1785), <span class="occ">classical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in December 1713 at St Ives, Cornwall, where he was baptized on 5 January 1714, the only son of Jonathan Toup (<i>d</i>. 1721), curate and lecturer of St Ives, and Prudence (1691&#150;1773), daughter of John Busvargas of St Just, Penwith. His father's family came from Dorset and his grandfather Onesiphorus Toup, rector of Bridport, appears to have lost most of the family property. Following his mother's marriage in September 1723 to John Keigwyn (<i>d</i>. 1761), vicar of Landrake and St Erney, Toup was adopted by his maternal uncle William Busvargas. He was educated at St Ives grammar school and afterwards at the Revd John Gurney's private school at St Merryn. From March 1733 to November 1739 he was a batteler of Exeter College, Oxford, where John Upton (1707&#150;1760) was his tutor throughout. He graduated BA on 14 October 1736 but did not proceed MA until 1756, when he took the degree from Pembroke College, Cambridge. He was ordained deacon on 6 March 1736 and three days later was licensed curate of Philleigh in Cornwall. There he remained until 29 May 1738, when he was licensed as curate of Buryan in the same county, having been ordained priest the previous day. Through his uncle's influence he was presented on 28 July 1750 to the rectory of St Martin by Looe, which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Toup's tenure of a curacy in a remote village gave him ample leisure to pursue his researches. His first publication was devoted to a recondite encyclopaedia containing important information of value for specialists, <span class="italic">Emendationes in Suidam</span> (3 pts, 1760&#150;66), and it established his reputation as a textual critic. The first two parts, dedicated respectively to George Lavington, bishop of Exeter, and Jacob Harris, brought him to the notice of William Warburton, bishop of Gloucester, who recommended him for preferment to Archbishop Secker, Lord Shelburne, and Frederick Keppel, bishop of Exeter. It is said that Warburton asked Keppel whether he had taken care of Toup. &#145;Toup, who is Toup?&#146; replied the bishop. &#145;A poor curate in your diocese&#146;, said Warburton, &#145;but the first Greek scholar in Europe&#146;  (W. Warburton, <span class="italic">Works</span>, new edn, 1811&#150;41, 14.247&#150;8). In return for his support Toup dedicated the third part of the <span class="italic">Emendationes</span> to Warburton. His <span class="italic">Epistola critica</span> (1767), addressed to Warburton, is generally considered as the fourth part of the <span class="italic">Emendationes</span>.<br>
<br>Toup contributed to an edition of Theocritus by Thomas Warton in 1770 and made similar contributions to various other editions issued later in that decade. His best-known work appeared in 1778; it was an edition of Longinus's <span class="italic">On the Sublime</span> and made this outstanding essay of ancient literary criticism far more accessible than it had been hitherto. It was the gift of a copy of this edition that stimulated Richard Porson to take up research in Greek. Toup's scholarship was greatly admired both at home and abroad but his critics claimed that his reputation was marred by a churlish, conceited, and supercilious nature. He praised few classicists other than Bentley, and his intemperate attacks on fellow scholars such as Robert Lowth, Benjamin Kennicott, and Johann Jacob Reiske led the last to describe him as &#145;homo truculentus et maledicus&#146;  (Brink, 93).<br>
<br>Following his mother's death in 1773 Toup inherited the property formerly owned by his stepfather and by his uncle and thus enjoyed a handsome income; at his own death his personal wealth was estimated at over &pound;12,000. Warburton's patronage finally won him further preferment in the church in May 1774, when he was appointed to a prebend at Exeter by Bishop Keppel. Keppel then nominated him to the vicarage of St Merryn, which he held from 29 July 1776 until his death. In the same month he was appointed chaplain to his old friend Bishop Hurd of Lichfield. Toup never married and from 1763 he had shared his house with his half-sister Ann (1730/31&#150;1814), widow of John Blake (<i>d</i>. 1763), and her three daughters, all of whom married into the Nicolas family. His sister Mary had married Charles Worth, an attorney of St Ives, who then married Toup's other half-sister, Prudence (<i>b</i>. 1727). Toup spent his last twenty-five years in St Martin and declined all inducements to move to London or Oxford. From 1780 his mental faculties deteriorated markedly and in his final months he was unable to perform his ministerial duties. He died at St Martin rectory on 19 January 1785 and was buried under the communion table of the church: his eldest half-niece, Phillis Blake, erected a small marble tablet to his memory in the church. His property passed to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20168/', "John Toup Nicolas (1788&#150;1851)")</script>, eldest son of his youngest half-niece, Margaret Blake. His library of classical, historical, and critical works, many of which contained manuscript notes by him, was sold by Leigh and Sotheby between 10 and 13 May 1786. Toup had left his manuscript notes on Polybius to the Clarendon Press in Oxford and Phillis Blake bequeathed the rest of his manuscripts to the Bodleian Library.<br>
