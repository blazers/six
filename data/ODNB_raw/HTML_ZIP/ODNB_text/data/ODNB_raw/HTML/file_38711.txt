<span class="headword">MacCarthy, Sir  (Charles Otto) Desmond</span>  (1877&#150;1952), <span class="occ">literary reviewer and drama critic</span>, was born at Plymouth, Devon, on 20 May 1877, the only child of Charles Desmond MacCarthy (1832/3&#150;1895), bank agent, and Louise Jeanne Wilhelmine de la Chevallerie (1854&#150;1938). His ancestors were English, Irish, and German. He spent his childhood in Leeds, and went on to attend Eton College (1888&#150;94), where he was educated, he said, by the boys, and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where his education was continued by his friends and himself. Elected to the Apostles, he came to know G. M. Trevelyan and R. C. Trevelyan, Roger Fry, Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster, and especially G. E. Moore, whose closest friend he became. Through friendship with younger Apostles and other members of Trinity, such as Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf, and Clive Bell, he became involved with the Bloomsbury group. MacCarthy read history and graduated aegrotat in 1897, started to study philosophy with Moore for a further degree, and after a term at Leipzig University prepared to be a novelist by reading extensively. He was acquainted with Samuel Butler, George Meredith, Leslie Stephen, and Henry James, all of whom influenced his development. On the death of his father in 1895 (his possessive mother survived until 1938) MacCarthy inherited about &pound;150 a year and remained impecunious for most of his career. He began, therefore, in 1903 to write not fiction but reviews. By 1906 he had become the drama critic for the Liberal <span class="italic">Speaker</span>, and recognized the importance of the Vedrenne&#150;Barker productions at the Court Theatre, particularly those of George Bernard Shaw's plays. MacCarthy's reviews, collected in his first book, <span class="italic">The Court Theatre</span> (1907), were, Shaw told him, closer to the mark than those of other critics. MacCarthy applied Moore's ideas in <span class="italic">Principia ethica</span> to the plays, and his criticism is still among the best that has been written of Shaw.<br>
<br>On 29 August 1906 MacCarthy married <a href="#cosubject_38711">Mary Warre-Cornish [<i>see below</i>]</a> and began to edit the <span class="italic">New Quarterly</span>, which a Cambridge friend financed for him; it lasted for three years and published significant work by Butler, Russell, Moore, and Fry. In 1910 MacCarthy became the secretary for Fry's celebrated first post-impressionist exhibition, and the introduction that he wrote for the catalogue became his most widely quoted work. He reviewed intermittently for various periodicals until 1913, when at Shaw's suggestion he was invited by Beatrice and Sidney Webb to become the drama critic for the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. (A lifelong Liberal, MacCarthy wrote most of his work for socialist and then Conservative papers.) During the First World War he served with the Red Cross and then joined naval intelligence. He became literary editor of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> under Clifford Sharp in 1920, and wrote a weekly column signed with the fitting pseudonym Affable Hawk. MacCarthy later described how rude Sharp could be about his exasperating elusiveness: Sharp &#145;would glare and I would despair&#151;but not reform&#146;  (MacCarthy, <span class="italic">Experience</span>, xv). As an editor he helped train many reviewers, including his successors Raymond Mortimer and Cyril Connolly. In 1927 MacCarthy began speaking on books for the BBC and over the next twenty-five years he broadcast hundreds of popular talks. The next year he succeeded Edmund Gosse as the principal reviewer for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. With a readership that reached 500,000, the paper made him the most influential literary journalist of the time. Also in 1928 he started <span class="italic">Life and Letters</span>, a general literary monthly underwritten by another patron. MacCarthy's involvement lasted until 1934, and in the course of his editorship he published work by Butler, Russell, Max Beerbohm, Hilaire Belloc, Thomas Hardy, Aldous Huxley, Virginia Woolf, Clive Bell, and many others.<br>
<br>MacCarthy had a wide literary and social acquaintance, and his charm as a sympathetic conversationalist (rather than a talker, for he was not a monologist) was legendary. But his development continued to be a disappointment to himself and his friends. Leonard Woolf thought the influence of Moore's high standards might have been to blame, and MacCarthy conceded that high standards and indolence had blighted his career. Only by procrastinating, he once explained, could he avoid spending &#145;a preposterous amount of time titivating&#146;  (Cecil and Cecil, 286). After abandoning attempts to write a novel before the war, MacCarthy planned to make a study of John Donne. In the 1920s Byron became his subject, and he gave the unpublished Clark lectures on him in 1929; in the 1930s it was to be a biography of Tolstoy. But the only books MacCarthy produced were collections of journalism. The second, called <span class="italic">Remnants</span>, was published in 1918. A selection of his biographical sketches appeared as <span class="italic">Portraits</span>: volume 1 came out in 1931, but no second volume followed. Subsequent collections of reviews appeared as <span class="italic">Criticism</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Experience</span> (1935), <span class="italic">Drama</span> (1940), and <span class="italic">Shaw</span> (1951). Three posthumous selections reusing some material from earlier books were <span class="italic">Memories</span>, <span class="italic">Humanities</span> (both 1953), and <span class="italic">Theatre</span> (1954). MacCarthy was knighted in 1951 and died in a nursing home in Cambridge of asthma, emphysema, and pneumonia, on 7 June 1952, shortly after receiving an honorary DLitt. He was buried in St Giles's churchyard, Cambridge.<br>
<br>MacCarthy accurately described himself as &#145;an acute and balanced critic who sometimes writes uncommonly well&#146;  (Cecil and Cecil, 292); yet as a weekly reviewer he was forced to serve up unripe thoughts and &#145;translate at once every feeling into intellectual discourse&#146;  (MacCarthy, <span class="italic">Portraits</span>, viii). He was distressed by &#145;an involved limpness&#146; in some of his writing  (MacCarthy, <span class="italic">Experience</span>, xi), and his good friend Virginia Woolf, who, like others, was entranced by his charm, complained of the &#145;damnable tepidity&#146; of his review of <span class="italic">The Waves</span>  (<span class="italic">Diary of Virginia Woolf</span>, 4.56). Something of MacCarthy's charm as well as tepidity is captured in the character of Bernard in that novel. MacCarthy was a traditional, eclectic, somewhat sceptical, rather unoriginal, but very widely read critic. His viewpoint was formed before the First World War and he regarded modernist writing with misgiving. (He confessed to being a backward and reluctant admirer of Woolf.) MacCarthy himself best described his critical theory in the preface to <span class="italic">Criticism</span>, where he argued that &#145;aesthetic taste is only further discrimination upon preferences determined by other causes&#146;. Part of the critic's job was to discuss ideas current both now and in the author's time, he continued, and therefore the reader's psychology was as much the critic's concern as the book being read. Perhaps MacCarthy's deepest literary conviction was that &#145;a work of art whatever its theme must somehow, somewhere, suggest the desirability of life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Drama</span>, 152).<br>

<a name="cosubject_38711"></a><span class="headword">Mary Josepha <span class="st"> [Molly]</span> MacCarthy <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Warre-Cornish]</span></span>, Lady MacCarthy  (1882&#150;1953), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Lynton, Devon, in August 1882, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36752/', "Francis Warre Warre-Cornish (1839&#150;1916)")</script>, vice-provost of Eton, and Blanche Ritchie (1848&#150;1922), novelist, whose eccentric sayings were collected as <span class="italic">Cornishiana</span>. Her marriage to Desmond MacCarthy on 29 August 1906 produced two sons, Michael and Dermod, and a daughter, Rachel (Lady David Cecil). An original, amusing, if diffident and distracted, personality, Molly MacCarthy has been credited with coining the term &#145;Bloomsbury&#146; as applied to her friends; in 1920 she founded Bloomsbury's Memoir Club to encourage Desmond's writing. Her novel <span class="italic">A Pier and a Band</span> (1918) amusingly represents characters resembling herself and her husband. An engaging memoir, <span class="italic">A Nineteenth-Century Childhood</span>, appeared in 1924. She suffered from her husband's feckless gregariousness. Deafness cruelly increased her isolation from his social life, but she continued to write, publishing biographical studies in <span class="italic">Fighting Fitzgerald and other Papers</span> (1930) and <span class="italic">Handicaps: Six Studies</span> (1936), and then a volume of miscellaneous sketches, entitled <span class="italic">Festival, etc.</span> (1936). A sequel to her childhood memoir was never completed. Molly MacCarthy died of heart failure on 28 December 1953 at Garrick's Villa, Hampton, Middlesex.<br>
