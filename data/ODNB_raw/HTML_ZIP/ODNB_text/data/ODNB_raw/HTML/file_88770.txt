<span class="headword">Deniz,  Francisco Antonio <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">guitarist and bandleader</span>, was born at 9 Christina Street, Cardiff, on 31 July 1912, the eldest of three sons of Antoni (or Antonio) Francisco Deniz, formerly Diniz (1878&#150;<i>c</i>.1931), a donkeyman (engine-room sailor), and his wife, Gertrude Blanch (or Blanche), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Boston (1886&#150;1974). His younger brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76164/', "Jos&#233; William (Joe) Deniz (1913&#150;1994)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76442/', "Laurence Richard (Laurie) Deniz (1924&#150;1996)")</script>; a sister died in infancy. Their father was an African from Cape Antonio in the Cape Verde Islands, and their mother, born in Cardiff, was of English and African American descent.<br>
<br>Deniz was born while his father was away at sea and baptized twice as a result. As Frank he was christened at St Mary's Church, Cardiff, under the rites of the Church of England, but when his father came home, he was baptized again as a Roman Catholic with the name Francisco Antonio. He grew up in Cardiff with his half-siblings, Maria Margaret Correa (1907&#150;1978) and Manoel Edward Correa (<i>b</i>. 1909), the children of their mother's first marriage, to Manoel or Manuel Correa, a ship's cook. Correa was a Cape Verdean, too, and thus, like Antoni Deniz, a member of what is believed to have been the first and oldest immigrant community in Cardiff's docks. As a boy Deniz heard African and Caribbean airs, sea shanties, and popular songs. He knew traditional Portuguese music through his father, who played violin, mandolin, and guitar, and learned to play by listening to Portuguese-speaking Cape Verdean Africans at Sunday sessions where his mother played piano.<br>
<br>Deniz attended South Church Street school and on leaving, aged fourteen, sold newspapers in the streets. When the newspaper's photographer hired Deniz to carry his equipment, he experienced a new life, attending race meetings where he observed Cardiff &#145;society&#146;. But his father disapproved and with an eye to the future took his eldest son to sea at fifteen, against his mother's wishes. For three years he worked on tramp ships, sometimes with his father, travelling to India, Malaya, Australia, China, and as far as Vladivostok. When his father was taken ill in Odessa, he was forced to leave him in hospital, where he died. He continued going to sea for nearly ten years, eventually qualifying as a donkeyman, while playing guitar and taking the opportunity to hear music wherever he travelled. In Jacksonville, Florida, he heard African American longshoremen singing work songs and blues, and encountered segregation. In Galveston and Charleston he came across &#145;holy-roller&#146; preachers and in Boston joined a gospel congregation.<br>
<br>Between voyages Deniz stayed in Cardiff. In 1934 he heard and met Louis Armstrong at the Empire Theatre, and the same year started playing music with his brother Joe, and with his future wife, <a href="#cosubject_88770">Clara Wason [<i>see below</i>]</a>; their Blue Hawaiians included another guitarist, Victor Parker. He played also with the dance band of the saxophonist Syd Clements and for a while he, too, played saxophone, mainly because of the limited role then available for stringed rhythm instruments in a band. His experiences in the Americas had shown him that he did not want to strum a banjo or play Hawaiian-style guitar; what inspired him was the single-string work of Teddy Bunn and Eddie Lang, pioneering American jazz guitarists who played clear melodic lines on the instrument.<br>
<br>On 8 August 1936 Deniz married Clara Wason at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Cardiff. Born in Cardiff on 30 September 1911, <a name="cosubject_88770"></a><span class="headword">Clara Ethel (Clare) Deniz <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wason]</span></span>  (1911&#150;2002), <span class="occ">pianist</span>, was the daughter of Frederick Wason (<i>c</i>.1883&#150;1913), a merchant seaman from Barbados, and Bessie Louise Bryant from Somerset, who had some French ancestry. She grew up with her mother in Grangetown, Cardiff, in the home of a Mrs Knight, who came from a mixed-race theatrical family in Bristol, and who was married to a ship's steward from the Caribbean; there Clara learned to play the piano, inspired by Louisa (Louie) Erskine, aunt of the heavyweight boxer Joe Erskine.<br>
<br>After their marriage Frank and Clara Deniz moved to London and immediately found their way into the raffish world of bottle-parties that dominated the capital's nightlife. They joined forces with other British-born musicians of colour, and moved around Soho, taking whatever work they could find. With the guitar yet to come into its own as a dance-band instrument, they often relied on Clara's income, and eventually it was she rather than Frank who (as Clare Deniz) joined an up and coming band when she replaced Yorke de Souza in the &#145;all-black&#146; orchestra of the Guyanese dancer Ken &#145;Snake Hips&#146; Johnson. In 1937 Frank Deniz spent a brief period as Johnson's second guitarist, playing alongside his brother Joe. The intention was to feature Joe on the amplified Hawaiian guitar, then a popular instrument, and another guitarist was needed to carry the rhythm. The birth of the Denizes' first daughter, Lorraine, in 1937, brought about his departure from the band, although he did so with the blessing of its leader. He then returned to the bottle-parties and jam-sessions. He met prominent American musicians including Art Tatum and Fats Waller, but it was not until he joined the Nigerian pianist Fela Sowande at the Florida Club in 1938 and accompanied the American singer Adelaide Hall that he received the exposure warranted by his developing abilities.<br>
<br>In May 1940 Deniz joined the merchant navy, and survived the dive-bombing of his ship. In San Francisco he heard Louis Armstrong again and met his hero, Teddy Bunn, then in Brazil encountered the Afro-Portuguese rhythmic music that would determine his artistic direction. The chance to practise came by playing &#145;Latin&#146; music with Edmundo Ros between voyages. In November 1941 he was among the leading musicians participating in the first recorded public jam session, organized by <span class="italic">Melody Maker</span>, the music trade's weekly newspaper. He played jazz and Latin American music with other bands, but because of his earlier seagoing career, was unable to escape his maritime commitments, despite being torpedoed twice. He continued to broadcast between voyages and joined ENSA to entertain troops with the accordionist Eric Winstone. Leading his own Spirits of Rhythm, named in homage to Teddy Bunn's group of the same name, his guitar playing drew accolades, while Clare also played with the band. Their second daughter, Claire Frances, was born in 1945.<br>
<br>At Rudy Evans's Caribbean Club, where he preceded Lauderic Caton in the house trio, Deniz drew the attention of the music profession's burgeoning modernists. He continued as a featured artist with Winstone, with whose band Clare also played, but although he worked with many jazz notables including the violinist St&eacute;phane Grappelli and at the Caribbean Club, where he returned in 1946, his goal lay elsewhere. To shake off the negative image that was attached&#151;unjustly&#151;to local black artists, he dropped the Americanisms he had adopted as a &#145;jazzman&#146;, and changed his presentation, demeanour, and dress. His fellow guitarist Ivor Mairants helped him initially but his breakthrough came about through the pianist Stanley Black, an admirer of the Deniz brothers who loved Latin American music. When Black became leader of the BBC Dance Orchestra in 1944 he gave Deniz his entr&eacute;e to radio by employing him regularly and introducing him to other leaders and arrangers&#151;and, importantly, contractors and producers, thereby helping to establish him as a session musician.<br>
<br>In 1953, Frank and Clare Deniz were reunited with Fela Sowande when they appeared in the BBC radio series <span class="italic">Club Ebony</span>, where Clare sang in Sowande's choir. The same year, inspired by an encounter with Carmen Miranda's musicians, Frank formed a Latin American band, Hermanos Deniz, which included his brother Joe, and later also their younger brother Laurence. For several years the band held prestigious residencies in London's West End. As the guitar grew in popularity, Deniz began writing and playing with his group for films. He created music for Orson Welles's <span class="italic">Three Cases of Murder</span> (1953) and, with Laurence, co-wrote thirty original pieces for Carol Reed's <span class="italic">Our Man in Havana</span> (1959).<br>
<br>Regarded as one of the leading guitarists of his generation, Deniz was a thoughtful and serious individual for whom respectability was crucial. The example of Ken &#145;Snake Hips&#146; Johnson's success with an &#145;all-black&#146; orchestra inspired him and determined him to organize an equally businesslike band. He did this through excellent musicianship and a capacity to adapt. His uncredited session work ranged from light music to rock 'n' roll but his favourite job came accompanying the American songwriter Hoagy Carmichael. His forte was reproducing the warmth, interplay, and percussive colour of African&#150;Portuguese and African&#150;Spanish rhythms. He continued to organize bands for private functions until 1980 when he and Clare moved to Spain. They worked occasionally in local bars and Frank studied Spanish guitar, but when Clare contracted Parkinson's disease in the 1990s they returned to England where he became her full-time carer. She died in Whitford, Hertfordshire, on 7 December 2002. Frank Deniz died at home, at 12 Amwell Lane, Stanstead Abbots, Hertfordshire, on 17 July 2005; like Clare he was cremated at Harlow crematorium. He was survived by his two daughters, Lorraine and Claire, the latter a successful cellist, known as Clare Deniz.<br>
