<span class="headword">Phillips,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, may have been of Welsh origin but his parents and background are otherwise obscure. Nothing is known of his early years and he is first mentioned in 1661, when he was appointed master gunner of the warship <i>Portsmouth</i>. In 1672, after passing an examination by the master gunner of England, he was appointed a gunner in the Tower of London. In 1673 he served in the navy under Admiral Spragge in the final engagement of the First Anglo-Dutch War. In 1678 he was commissioned ensign in the company of the governor of Portsmouth, George Legge, later Lord Dartmouth, with whom he developed a close professional relationship. He became an expert on bombardment and fortification and was recognized as a military engineer. In 1679&#150;80 he was sent to the Channel Islands to make maps and plans of the bays, probable landing-places and defences, both existing and required. While there he also executed a number of topographical views in watercolour.<br>
<br>In 1683 Phillips sailed with Dartmouth's expedition to destroy the fortifications and mole at Tangier. His drawings of the demolition were later shown to the king as proof of the venture's success. Samuel Pepys, who accompanied the expedition, found Phillips to be a man with views on many topics, including the improvement of navigation skills, the need to study the world's currents, the importance of mathematics in the educational curriculum of children intended for careers at sea, the simplification of the rigging of ships, and the needlessness of discovering the means of calculating longitude, which he believed would only bring about miscarriages at sea. On his return to England in April 1684, he was appointed third engineer of the ordnance in July with salary backdated to September 1683. In the summer of 1684 he was sent to France, where he met Vauban in Luxembourg and viewed the frontier fortifications on the Rhine and the channel ports. He reported to Dartmouth that he had &#145;taken particular observations of all things that can in any way be serviceable to us, especially in the affairs of the artillery&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 1.119&#150;20).<br>
<br>Phillips was next sent to inspect the defences of Portsmouth, where he was to supervise the construction of new works. In August 1684, in response to a request from the duke of Ormond, he was ordered to Ireland to survey the fortifications and harbours, draw exact designs, and advise on necessary repairs. His report, completed in 1685, criticized the condition and effectiveness of existing defences and recommended major improvements at a total cost of &pound;554,000. Phillips's survey was accompanied by meticulous plans of the cities, principal towns, and other strong points. His familiarity with contemporary fortress design is clear from the drawings of citadels and redoubts he recommended to strengthen the fortifications of Dublin and other key strategic locations. He drafted &#145;Rules, orders and directions for regulating the office of ordnance in Ireland&#146;, and with Francis Povey surveyed the ordnance and arms remaining in the king's stores in Ireland and recommended the building and repair of storehouses for their protection. James II referred the matter to the Irish administration in 1686, but the immense expenditure involved ensured that little or nothing was done to implement his proposals. On his return to England in the summer of 1685 the earl of Longford, former master-general of the Irish ordnance, wrote to Dartmouth praising the character and conduct of &#145;Honest Tom Phillips&#146; and regretting his departure  (<span class="italic">Dartmouth MSS</span>, 1.125). During his tour Phillips executed nine delightful &#145;prospects&#146;, or views, of Irish towns and harbours, using pencil, pen and ink, and colourwash. These show the influence of Dutch landscapists then at work in England, and are of considerable artistic merit, as well as providing an invaluable topographical record of Irish towns in the late seventeenth century.<br>
<br>In December 1685 Phillips was appointed second engineer at an annual salary of &pound;250. For the rest of James II's reign he was based at the Board of Ordnance in London, but visited Poole, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Chatham, and Sheerness to inspect and advise on the defences. In 1687 his duties included the erection of a fort on Hounslow Heath for the army's summer exercises. In December of that year he was commissioned captain of the company of miners in Lord Dartmouth's ordnance regiment. In November 1688, writing from Portsmouth, Phillips reported to Dartmouth on the strength of the Dutch fleet which had brought William of Orange to Torbay. Initially he seems to have been unsympathetic to the revolution of 1688, possibly because it brought about the fall from power of his patron, Dartmouth. In 1689, on the pretext that he was owed significant arrears of salary, he refused to go to Ireland with Schomberg, who dismissed him from his company and his post of second engineer. However, in July 1690 he was sent to work on the fortifications of Portsmouth, where his diligence was commended by Queen Mary. In September he sailed as an engineer with Marlborough's expedition to Munster, and attended the sieges of Cork and Kinsale, where his detailed knowledge of the fortifications must have proved invaluable. Plans of these operations retained by Marlborough are believed to be his work. In April 1691 he was restored to office as second engineer. In 1690 his design for a new gun carriage was adopted for all the guns of the ship <i>Royal Sovereign</i>. He also invented a mould to cast large cannon, and shortly before his death sought to establish a company to manufacture ordnance, which he hoped to supply to the crown.<br>
<br>By 1692 Phillips's pay was in arrears, and he was evidently in severe financial difficulty, complaining that he could no longer afford to live in London with his family. In August he was sent with a number of ships to report on possible landing-places on the Channel Islands and to reconnoitre St Malo, the leading base of the French privateers. He returned to England with his report in October. In 1693 he was appointed chief engineer to the train of brass ordnance for sea service. In November he was sent with Commodore Benbow and a naval squadron, which included bomb-vessels and fireships, to destroy St Malo. After a three-day bombardment during which Phillips directed the bomb-vessels, on 19 November he took a 300 ton galliot packed with explosives inshore with the intention of reducing the town to ashes. The vessel grounded before quite reaching the harbour, but damaged hundreds of houses and brought down the sea wall of the port when it exploded. Phillips escaped the scene, but his death within days, aboard Benbow's ship at Guernsey Road in the Channel Islands on 22 November, may have been related to the incident. A week later his body was brought ashore at Portsmouth, where he was buried on 29 November with military honours in the church. Soon afterwards an allowance was paid to his son Thomas to study engineering. His widow, Frances, whom Phillips married at an unknown date, claiming she had five children unprovided for, sought payment of his arrears of pay and a pension out of the Welsh revenue. The British Library, the National Library of Ireland, the Public Record Office, and Worcester College, Oxford, hold collections of his surviving plans and drawings.<br>
