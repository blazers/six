<span class="headword">Robertson,  Margaret Ethel</span>  (1861&#150;1943), <span class="occ">headmistress and educationist</span>, was born on 7 February 1861 at Dawlish, Devon, the third daughter of George Samuel Robertson (1825&#150;1874). She was privately educated before attending Newnham College, Cambridge, where in 1889 she achieved a class one in the medieval and modern languages tripos. She attended the training department of the Ladies' College, Cheltenham, and in 1890 obtained the Cambridge teachers' certificate. She received an excellent apprenticeship as an assistant mistress at Bedford high school from 1890 to 1893, when she was appointed headmistress of Christ's Hospital Girls' School, Hertford.<br>
<br>The &#145;audacious moves to modernise and expand&#146;  (Angus, 23) initiated by Miss Robertson during her twenty-eight years as headmistress of Christ's Hospital Girls' School resulted in extended buildings, including a new chapel consecrated in 1906, increased numbers of pupils, outstanding academic achievements, and changes in the curriculum. When she took office the subjects taught included needlework and cookery, but did not include mathematics, science, or foreign languages other than French. Most girls left between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. She expanded both the staff and the curriculum, and soon achieved examination successes. Pupils began to go on to Cambridge and other universities. She believed that academic subjects in themselves were insufficient for girl's development, and she ensured that the school acquired a games field, a gymnasium, and a swimming bath, though she did not make games compulsory. Pupils' need for free time was respected and she believed in allowing them to develop a sense of responsibility. In order to reinforce respect due to senior pupils, she introduced different uniforms for them and junior pupils, but she abolished curtseying by pupils to staff. Her essay &#145;Resident schools and boarding houses&#146;, published in <span class="italic">Public Schools for Girls</span> (1911), edited by Sara Burstall and Mary Douglas, set out her views and current practice on matters relating to pupils' health and welfare in boarding-schools. Although committed to equal educational opportunities for girls, she still upheld conventionally feminine notions of self-denial and service, believing that the boarding-school should cultivate &#145;the habit of thinking and working for the community and not merely for the self&#146;  (ibid., 228).<br>
<br>When Miss Robertson retired in 1921 Christ's Hospital was recognized as one of the leading girls' schools. From 1913 to 1915 she was president of the Association of Head Mistresses, and during Trinity term 1924 was acting principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford, following the death of Miss Jourdain. She died at her home, 29 Leckford Road, Oxford, on 24 January 1943.<br>
