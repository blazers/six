<span class="headword">Hodgson,  Francis</span>  (1781&#150;1852), <span class="occ">college head and poet</span>, second son of James Hodgson, rector of Humber, Herefordshire, and Jane, daughter of the Revd Richard Coke, was born at Croydon, Surrey, on 16 November 1781. In 1794 he entered Eton College as a pupil of John Keate, and in 1799 he was elected scholar of King's College, Cambridge, where he became acquainted with Thomas Denman, J. H. Merivale, and Henry Drury. He graduated BA in 1804, MA in 1807, and BD in 1840. He obtained a fellowship at King's College in 1802, was private tutor for three years to the sons of Lady Ann Lambton, and in 1806 held a mastership for one year at Eton. He then contemplated the bar as a profession, but, being dissuaded by Denman, turned his attention to literature. During the next ten years he wrote many reviews, verses, translations, and rhyming letters, of which the most important was his translation of Juvenal (1807). He was a frequent contributor in 1811 to the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> and <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> on classical and literary subjects. In 1807 he was appointed to a resident tutorship at King's, which he held until his marriage.<br>
<br>Hodgson became best known for his literary friendship with Byron, dating from 1806, when he contributed to the <span class="italic">Anthologia Graeca</span>, which Byron later eulogized. Byron mediated after Hodgson had seduced the mistress of the Revd Robert Bland, who was one of the editors of the <span class="italic">Anthologia</span> and a master at Harrow School. For his part, Hodgson, alarmed at Byron's religious scepticism, strove to impress upon the poet the truth of Christian teaching during a long correspondence in 1810&#150;11 when Byron was abroad. The death of Hodgson's father in 1810 left him encumbered with debts, which Byron helped him to meet. A gift of &pound;1000 by Byron in 1813 enabled him to marry, on 5 August 1815, Matilda, the daughter of Archdale Wilson Tayler, her mother having at first objected to his suit on the grounds of his lack of means. Frederick and William Tayler were his brothers-in-law. During the separation of Lord and Lady Byron in 1816 Hodgson corresponded with Byron and Mrs Leigh, and made an unsuccessful appeal to Lady Byron. His poetic works in this period included <span class="italic">Lady Jane Grey</span> (1809) and <span class="italic">Leaves of Laurel</span> (1812), and a translation, undertaken with the classical scholar Samuel Butler, of Lucien Bonaparte's poem <span class="italic">Charlemagne</span> (1815).<br>
<br>Hodgson was ordained in 1814, serving a curacy at Bradden, Northamptonshire, in 1815 before being presented in 1816 to the living of Bakewell, Derbyshire. There he enhanced his reputation as an accomplished classical scholar by producing a number of works on Latin versification, specially adapted for use at Eton. He contributed Latin verses to <span class="italic">Arundines Cami</span> (ed. H. Drury, 1841), an influential early anthology. His first wife died, childless, in 1833 and he married, on 3 May 1838, Elizabeth, second daughter of Lord Denman, his Cambridge friend. His whig connections brought him further ecclesiastical preferment: Melbourne had appointed him to the archdeaconry of Derby, in succession to Samuel Butler in 1836, and in 1838 the duke of Devonshire presented him to the living of Edensor, Derbyshire.<br>
<br>Hodgson was nominated by the queen, on Melbourne's recommendation, provost of Eton College in April 1840, the fellows having shown a preference first for Dr Keate and then for John Lonsdale of King's College, London. He graduated BD at Cambridge to qualify himself for the office, which he held in conjunction with the rectory of Cottesford, Oxfordshire. The reputation he had gained in Derbyshire as a conscientious and efficient administrator was maintained at Eton, where it was said that no provost had &#145;more thoroughly realized the duties and responsibilities&#146; attaching to that office  (Lyte, 476). He encouraged the headmaster, E. C. Hawtrey, in carrying through a number of reforms, taking a particular interest in improving the accommodation of the collegers and in the restoration of the chapel. Much of his effectiveness was due to a combination of energy with tact and courtesy. After suffering from influenza, he died at The Lodge, Eton College, on 29 December 1852, leaving a widow and five children. He was buried on 4 January 1853 in the college chapel.<br>
