<span class="headword">Porter,  Josias Leslie</span>  (1823&#150;1889), <span class="occ">missionary and promoter of Irish education</span>, born on 4 October 1823, was the youngest son of William Porter of Carrowan, parish of Burt, co. Donegal, and Margaret, daughter of Andrew Leslie of Drumgowan in the same parish. The father farmed several hundred acres of land. Noted for his great stature and immense bodily strength, he raised, during the Irish rising of 1798, a troop of yeomanry in Burt, and kept a large district in order, services for which he received the thanks of parliament and an honorary commission in the army.<br>
<br>The son, Josias, after being educated privately between 1835 and 1838 by Samuel Craig, Presbyterian minister of Crossroads, co. Londonderry, and afterwards at a school in Londonderry, matriculated in the University of Glasgow in 1839, with a view to entering the ministry of the Irish Presbyterian church. He graduated BA in 1841 and MA in 1842. In November 1842 he proceeded to the University of Edinburgh, where, and afterwards in the New College, he studied theology under Thomas Chalmers. He was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Derry on 20 November 1844, ordained on 25 February 1846, and until 1849 was minister of the Presbyterian congregation of High Bridge, Newcastle upon Tyne. That year he married Margaret Rainey, youngest daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6168/', "Revd Dr Henry Cooke (1788&#150;1868)")</script>, whose biography he wrote (1871); they had several children, two sons and two daughters surviving him.<br>
<br>Later in 1849 Porter was sent to Damascus as a missionary to the Jews by the board of missions of the Irish Presbyterian church. He reached Syria in December 1849, and remained there for ten years. While discharging his duty as a missionary he acquired, by frequent and extensive journeys, an intimate knowledge of Syria and Palestine, which he turned to good literary account. In 1855 he published his first book on the East, <span class="italic">Five Years in Damascus</span> (with his own map, plans, and woodcuts), in which he tells most graphically the story of his life there, and of adventurous journeys to Palmyra, the Hauran, Lebanon, and other places. In 1858 he published his <span class="italic">Handbook for Travellers in Syria and Palestine</span>, in John Murray's series. A second edition, largely rewritten, appeared in 1875, Porter having in the interval revisited the country and made an extensive tour on both sides of the Jordan and along the borderland between Egypt and Sinai. Many of his letters, addressed to the Revd David Hamilton, honorary secretary of the Irish Presbyterian Jewish Mission, were printed in the pages of the <span class="italic">Missionary Herald</span>.<br>
<br>In 1859 Porter returned home on furlough, and in July 1860 he was appointed professor of biblical criticism in the Presbyterian college, Belfast, in succession to Robert Wilson. In 1864 he received the degrees of LLD from Glasgow and DD from Edinburgh. In 1867, on the death of Professor William Gibson (1808&#150;1867), he became secretary of the college faculty at Belfast. Through him Adam Findlater of Dublin in 1878 gave &pound;10,000 for additions to the buildings, and this gift proved the means of raising a further &pound;11,000 for the professorial endowment fund. From the time of his appointment as professor, Porter took a leading part in the work of the church courts, and in 1875 he was elected moderator of the general assembly. During his tenure of this office he initiated a fund which provided manses for many congregations.<br>
<br>In 1878 Porter was appointed by the government as one of the two assistant commissioners of the newly established board of intermediate education for Ireland. He thereupon resigned his professorship, and moved to Dublin to help to organize the new scheme. In 1879 he was nominated president of Queen's College, Belfast. In virtue of his office he became a member of the senate of the newly created Royal University of Ireland, which in 1881 conferred on him the degree of DLitt, and he took a leading part in formulating its plans.<br>
<br>Porter published several works in addition to those mentioned, including <span class="italic">The Pentateuch and the Gospels</span> (1864), <span class="italic">The Giant Cities of Bashan and Syria's Holy Places</span> (1865), and <span class="italic">Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Bethany</span> (1887). He wrote extensively for Smith's <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span>, Kitto's <span class="italic">Pictorial Bible</span>, and the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca sacra</span>. Porter died in the Queen's College, Belfast, on 16 March 1889, and was buried in Malone cemetery, near Belfast. After his death his widow was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;50.<br>
