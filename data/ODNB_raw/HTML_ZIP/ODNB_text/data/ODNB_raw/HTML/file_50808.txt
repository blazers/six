<span class="headword">Barnes, Sir  Denis Charles</span>  (1914&#150;1992), <span class="occ">civil servant and industrial relations expert</span>, was born on 15 December 1914 at 4 Station Road, Openshaw, Manchester, the second son and fifth of six children of Frederick Charles Barnes (<i>c</i>.1870&#150;<i>c</i>.1920), a school attendance officer for the local education committee, and his wife, Martha Lilley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berry (1876&#150;<i>c</i>.1920). His parents were self-educated, avid users of public libraries, and keen to see their children educated. From this lower-middle-class metropolitan background, Barnes attended Plymouth Grove elementary school, Manchester, and won scholarships to Hulme grammar school, Manchester, and Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated with first-class honours in modern history in 1936 and a second-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1937. He went straight from Oxford into the civil service, joining the Ministry of Labour. On 29 April 1938 he married Patricia Abercrombie (<i>b</i>. 1917), a novelist and the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Murray Abercrombie. They met at a party in London. After their marriage they lived in flats in Battersea and then at 170 Gloucester Place, London, acquiring a rural retreat at Serridge Lodge in the Forest of Dean in the 1960s. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Barnes spent his entire career in the home civil service, except for a year touring the USA and two years on secondment to the Foreign Office. He served as private secretary to the minister of labour, George Isaac, in 1945&#150;7, and then progressed steadily within the ministry, becoming deputy secretary in 1963 and succeeding Sir James Dunnett as permanent secretary in 1966. The ministry was renamed the Department of Employment and Productivity in 1968 and the Department of Employment in 1970; Barnes remained permanent secretary until the end of 1973. He was made CB in 1964 and KCB in 1967.<br>
<br>Barnes was not an archetypal civil servant. Though possessing one of the best brains of his generation, he was more of a fixer than a paper-based policy analyst; he was very outward looking, and latterly spent much time offering advice lying on a ministry sofa. He did not treat his headquarters at 8 St James's Square as an ivory tower, instead forging very active personal links with the press (especially the corps of industrial correspondents), with industrial leaders, and with members of the TUC general council, including successive general secretaries. Defeatist and pessimistic about Britain's post-war, post-empire role, in private he would counsel orderly retreat in terms of global influence and industrial clout, and, at times, in the face of trade-union power.<br>
<br>Growing impatient with voluntary negotiation in the early 1960s, Barnes sought to improve workers' protection by a burst of legislation on contracts of employment, redundancy payments, and industrial training. He also favoured the establishment of the Donovan royal commission on trades unions and employers' associations (1965&#150;8). Scarred by the Wilson government's failure to support the attempt of his minister Barbara Castle to implement the Donovan commission's findings by regulating unions' access to industrial action through the white paper <span class="italic">In Place of Strife</span> (1969), Barnes underwent something of a personal U-turn in his views in 1970, concluding that though statutory intervention was logically necessary, both to regulate strikes and to control pay inflation, no British government would see it through.<br>
<br>At his best when keeping his finger on the pulse of major industrial disputes, Barnes used the infamous back door to 8 St James's Square both to listen to and to advise a string of employers and trade-union leaders, and the occasional independent arbitrator. Immensely influential, this talent was widely recognized in Whitehall and he often visited no. 10 to give personal advice to prime ministers Wilson and Heath. Wilson went so far as to describe him as &#145;the best Permanent Secretary in Whitehall&#146;  (B. Castle, <span class="italic">The Castle Diaries, 1964&#150;76</span>, 1990, 215). His influence probably peaked in 1972, which saw the first miners' strike settled by the Wilberforce inquiry and a prolonged search by the Heath administration for a voluntary pact on pay. Barnes viewed a pact as akin to the philosopher's stone and he fell out of favour when in November 1972 the Heath administration changed tack and a statutory pay, prices, and dividend freeze was introduced. As permanent secretary he permitted radical restructuring of his department, creating executive agencies including the Health and Safety Executive, the Training Services Agency (TSA), the Employment Services Agency (ESA), and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS).<br>
<br>In 1973 it was decided that the TSA and the ESA should be overseen by the tripartite Manpower Services Commission, and Barnes became the commission's first chairman, in 1974. Unemployment had reached a post-war peak of 1 million in early 1972. Barnes encouraged large-scale vocational training and job creation schemes, and saw the benchmark&#151;100,000 trainees&#151;achieved. He established a degree of independence from the department, which positioned the commission well for the subsequent development of extensive youth training schemes; these eventually <i>de facto</i> extended the formal period of education and training for most young people in Britain to the age of eighteen. He retired from the Manpower Services Commission in 1976, settling with his wife at Wittersham, Kent. He was president of the Manpower Society from 1976, and a director of Glynwed Ltd and the General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation.<br>
<br>Idiosyncratic, cynical, and sometimes destructively witty, Barnes inspired huge loyalty from the small circle of colleagues he allowed close. As a modern historian he looked back with pleasure at the lasting achievements of the Manpower Services Commission, and with amazement at Margaret Thatcher's changes to the industrial relations landscape he had thought unattainable. Perhaps to keep the dark arts of conciliation veiled, his own book (written with Eileen Reid), <span class="italic">Government and Trade Unions</span> (1980), was bland, uninformative, and pessimistic, and was described at the time by Geoffrey Goodman writing in the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> (3 June 1980) as a Wagnerian account of frustration and failure. As a social reformer Barnes made permanent gains in worker protection and vocational training, but in industrial relations his caution and fear of revolution may have delayed reform. He was christened into the Church of England, but was not a practising member. He died following an allergic reaction to a bee sting at his home, the Old Inn, 30 The Street, Wittersham, Kent, on 6 May 1992, and was buried in Wittersham churchyard about five days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
