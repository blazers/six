<span class="headword">Boyne,  John</span>  (1750s&#150;1810), <span class="occ">watercolour painter and engraver</span>, was born in co. Down, Ireland. His father was originally a joiner by trade, but afterwards held an appointment in the victualling office at Deptford for many years. Boyne was brought to England when about nine years old, and subsequently articled (<i>c</i>.1770) in London to the landscape engraver William Byrne (1743&#150;1805), who is principally known for his antiquarian engravings after Thomas Hearne. After his apprenticeship had ended, he attempted to work independently but, apparently, lack of application and a dissipated lifestyle worked against him. Unsuccessful as an engraver, he embarked on a more congenial career, joining a company of strolling actors near Chelmsford. He appeared in several plays, and assisted in a farce entitled <span class="italic">Christmas</span>. However, soon wearying of life as an actor he returned to London in 1781, and took up a trade of pearl-setting, being employed by a Mr Flower, of Chichester Rents, Chancery Lane. Later he appears as a master in a drawing school, first in Holborn, and then in Gloucester Street, Queen Square, where Thomas Heaphy and James Holmes were his pupils.<br>
<br>Boyne exhibited eighteen pieces, mainly classical, Shakespearian, and biblical subjects, at the Royal Academy between 1788 and 1809, giving his London addresses as 11 Great Turnstile, Lincoln's Inn Fields (1788), 34 Gloucester Street, Queen Square (1791&#150;1801), and from 1802, 43 Penton Place, Pentonville. Boyne died at the last address on 22 June 1810. His most important artistic works were watercolour heads of Shakespearian characters, resembling those of John Hamilton Mortimer, some of which were engraved; other significant works include <span class="italic">Assignation</span>, <span class="italic">A Sketch to the Memory of the Duke of Bedford</span>, <span class="italic">The Muck Worm</span>, and <span class="italic">The Glow Worm</span>. Boyne's best work is probably the large Rowlandson-like watercolour <span class="italic">Meeting of Connoisseurs</span> (V&amp;A), a scene in an artist's studio which includes a self-portrait; it was engraved in stipple by T. Williamson. The British Museum holds <span class="italic">The Quack Doctor</span> and a head of King Lear in black chalk and wash; other examples of Boyne's work are in the Royal Collection at Windsor and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.<br>
