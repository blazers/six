<span class="headword">Felton,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1628), <span class="occ">assassin</span>, was born, perhaps near Sudbury in Suffolk, the son of Thomas Felton (<i>d</i>. 1611&times;14) and his wife, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. in or after 1630), daughter of William Wright, one-time mayor of Durham. He was one of nine children in a family of precarious gentle status, a junior branch of the Feltons of Playford in Suffolk, distantly related to the earl of Arundel. His family circumstances were volatile. Thomas Felton had enjoyed a lucrative career as a pursuivant, hunting down recusants and systematizing procedures for sequestering their estates. In 1602, however, his notorious efforts came to a halt when he lost his post to Sir Henry Spiller. Despite energetic efforts to recover his position by tarring Spiller as soft on recusancy, by June 1611 Thomas Felton was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet, where he died, not long after, a ruined man. In recompense for his services, however, his widow managed to secure a &pound;100 per annum pension from the crown.<br>
<br>Nothing is known of John Felton until the mid-1620s, when he became a professional soldier. His career in arms proved frustrating. He sailed with the ill-fated 1625 expedition to Cadiz, and on his return spent part of 1626 in Ireland as a lieutenant in a company commanded by a Captain Lee. On Lee's death Felton tried and failed to take his place as captain. In May and June 1627 Felton was one of a number of officers who petitioned for a captain's post on the forthcoming expedition to relieve the Huguenots of La Rochelle. But despite his efforts, and help from Sir William Uvedale and Sir William Beecher, Felton failed to secure a post as either captain or lieutenant. In August, however, he was selected to travel with a second wave of troops. Holding the rank of lieutenant&#151;probably in Captain Williams's company under the regimental command of Sir James Ramsey&#151;Felton arrived on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;, outside La Rochelle, late in September. Felton's experiences on the island were traumatic. In its final weeks the expedition was rapidly running out of supplies and ideas. At the end of October the English attempt to storm St Martin's citadel was easily repelled. Felton was undoubtedly present at the disastrous assault and witnessed at first hand the horrific slaughter of English troops during both the attack and the ignominious retreat that ensued.<br>
<br>Felton left R&eacute; in late 1627 with a wounded hand and no promise of promotion, and made his way to London, where his mother, brother Edmond, and widowed sister Elizabeth were living. For about nine months Felton lodged in Fleet Lane in the house of Thomas Foot, a servant to the warder of the Fleet prison. Foot recalled Felton as a taciturn man, an impression seconded by another lodger who remembered him as &#145;melancholy &hellip; much given to reading of books, and of very few words&#146;  (SP 16/118/16). Felton's brother Edmond&#151;who saw little of him in London&#151;thought him in general of a &#145;melancholy disposition&#146;  (SP 16/114/31-I), but it seems clear that his combat experiences had darkened his mood. His sister recalled that, since his return from R&eacute;, Felton had been much troubled &#145;by dreams of fighting&#146;  (SP 16/118/54). Felton was also nursing a personal grievance against the duke of Buckingham, whom he blamed for withholding about &pound;80 in back pay and for twice thwarting his promotion to captain. Felton engaged a scrivener, George Willoughby, to draw up a new series of petitions to various privy councillors pleading for his back pay and promotion, but his efforts failed.<br>
<br>At the scrivener's shop, some time late in June 1628, Felton found Willoughby transcribing a copy of the remonstrance against Buckingham, drawn up earlier that month by the House of Commons. Eventually Felton prevailed upon Willoughby to lend him the document, which he read at The Windmill inn in Shoe Lane. The remonstrance had a profound effect on Felton, convincing him that his personal suffering at Buckingham's hands was part of a much larger story, that of the duke's wicked and treacherous rule over the whole nation. After several weeks brooding on the remonstrance, Felton decided to act. On Monday 18 August 1628 he resolved to kill the duke of Buckingham and &#145;make himself a martyr for his country&#146;  (SP 16/114/20&#150;21). The following day Felton visited the lodgings of his mother and sister to say goodbye. He told his mother that his debts were mounting and that he was going to Portsmouth to ask the duke for his back pay.<br>
<br>On the morning of Saturday 23 August the duke of Buckingham awoke to the good, though inaccurate, news that the French siege of La Rochelle had been lifted. After finishing his breakfast, the duke hurried through the parlour of his lodgings in The Greyhound inn on Portsmouth High Street, intending to take the joyful news to the king, who was staying nearby at Southwick. Amid a crowd of clients and military men, the duke was making his way to the door when he stopped to return the greetings of one of his colonels, Sir Thomas Fryer. Just behind Fryer, nestled in the jostling crowd, was John Felton. As Fryer made his bow to the duke, Felton reached over the colonel's lowered shoulder and plunged a cheap dagger into Buckingham's chest. Muttering an oath, the duke fell to the ground, dead. Chaos ensued, giving Felton a clear chance to escape, but instead he made his way to the inn's kitchen. Soon after, perhaps confused by the yells of &#145;A Frenchman!&#146; which he mistook for his own name, Felton left the kitchen and, drawing his sword, announced to the frantic mob, &#145;I am the one&#146;  (SP 16/114/20&#150;21). He was immediately seized. Stitched inside his hatband were two statements justifying his deed, insisting that, as a soldier and a gentleman, he had chosen to hazard his life for the honour of his God, king, and country.<br>
<br>Felton was interrogated that afternoon in Portsmouth and later taken to the Tower of London. The authorities were convinced that the assassin had not acted alone, and on 26 August the king established a commission to discover by any means, including torture, the identity of Felton's accomplices. Felton himself consistently denied any conspiracy, and after three months of strenuously chasing false leads the authorities reluctantly agreed. On 27 November Felton was convicted in king's bench, after a trial in which Attorney-General Heath branded him a base, atheistical coward and a disgrace to the profession of arms.<br>
<br>Two days later, on 29 November 1628, Felton was hanged at Tyburn. For some weeks, he had been visited by clerics deputed by the authorities to encourage a full and repentant confession. A printed account, seconded by a number of eyewitness reports, suggests that Felton made an edifying end on the scaffold, confessing his crime, acknowledging its wickedness, and praying for forgiveness. A newsletter writer reported that the earl of Arundel attended the execution with a winding sheet for his distant relative's corpse. The winding sheet, however, proved unnecessary. Felton's body was cut down and taken to Portsmouth where it was hung in chains to rot.<br>
<br>Three months earlier, as he was being taken from Portsmouth to London, John Felton had passed through the town of Kingston, where an old woman had called out to him, &#145;God bless thee, little David!&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 390, fol. 437<i>r</i>). Felton had believed that in killing Buckingham he would become the martyr of his country. In the weeks following the assassination, as Felton sat in the Tower under threat of torture, his actions were celebrated across the land. Toasts were drunk in Dover alehouses and Oxford butteries. Copies of Felton's hatband statements were passed from hand to hand. Stories of his words and deeds were exchanged in the streets or scrawled into newsletters. Dozens of poems celebrated his actions, hailing the melancholy, frustrated lieutenant as a patriot hero, God's agent, England's deliverer, another Phineas, another Ehud. Where the duke was effeminate, cowardly, popish, and corrupt, Felton was manly, brave, protestant, and virtuous. One poet declaimed,<blockquote>
<div>Stout Macabee, thy most mighty arm,<br>
</div>
<div>With zeal and justice arm'd, hath in truth won<br>
</div>
<div>The prize of patriot to a British son.<br>
</div> (Fairholt, 70)</blockquote>Poets interpreted the torture inflicted on his body as a mark of his martyr's virtue. Versified accounts of his execution had him unrepentant to the end. And his shameful hanging in chains was refigured as a glorious burial under a heavenly tomb bejewelled with stars, removed from the worms and corruptions of an earthly grave. The vast gulf between the poets who lionized Felton and the authorities who punished him pointedly suggests the gravity of the political crisis of the later 1620s. And the popular celebration of Felton's deed undoubtedly inspired in Charles I a deeper distrust of his subjects, a distrust that pushed him along the road to personal rule.<br>
