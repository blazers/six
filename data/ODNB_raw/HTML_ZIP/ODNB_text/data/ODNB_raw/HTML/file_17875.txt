<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Malet, Sir  Charles Warre</span>, first baronet  (1753&#150;1815), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was the eldest son of Alexander Malet (1704&#150;1775), rector of Combe Florey, Somerset, and Maiden Newton, Dorset, and his wife, Ann, daughter of the Revd Laurence St Lo of Pulham, Dorset. At an early age he entered the service of the East India Company. He filled various posts, including charge of a mission to the Mughal emperor and of the residency at Cambay from 1774 to 1785, where he formed views in favour of expanding British power in India. Malet also developed an unrivalled knowledge of Gujarat and western India more generally, and was dispatched by the government in Calcutta to persuade the Maratha leader Sindhia to accept the appointment of a company resident to the court of the peshwa at Poona, a post which he took up himself in November 1785.<br>
<br>Malet was by now associated with those, such as David Scott, who argued strongly in favour of consolidating and expanding the East India Company's Bombay presidency. He was keen to use the influence and energy of private traders to bolster the company's position in western India, and in 1780 had noted that &#145;Surat Broach and Cambay form the shackles of Gujrat&#146; (Malet's letter-book, 1780; Nightingale, 137). For Malet, trade and British power went hand in hand, and he saw clearly the potential value of India's west coast to the China trade. In 1782 he recorded how a forward policy there<blockquote>opens a new prospect inviting the exercise of our arms, our policy and that great line of liberal justice by which reducing to order a country plundered by a thousand predatory chieftains is as easy to execute, as worthy of attention of a great and generous people, and the more readily to be adopted when consistent with their interest, their honour and perhaps necessary to the reestablishment of their affairs.(22 Feb 1782; Nightingale, 139)</blockquote>The company's constant preoccupation with retrenchment meant that Malet's ideas were not immediately accepted. Nevertheless, he has been credited by Pamela Nightingale with &#145;a new vision &hellip; which influenced [Charles] Cornwallis and his successors as Governor General in Calcutta and Henry Dundas and the Court of Directors in London&#146;  (Nightingale, 137). His work also helped to lay foundations for Richard Wellesley's forward policy after 1798, Malet's imperialism having a clarity of design and loftiness of vision &#145;which Wellesley could not add to&#146;  (ibid., 174). In 1790 his correspondence with Lord Cornwallis was also influential in persuading Dundas against the proposed abolition of the company's Bombay presidency.<br>
<br>Changing circumstances in western India soon validated Malet's arguments for a more assertive policy. In 1789 Tipu Sultan of Mysore attacked Travancore, a company ally. Cornwallis decided to counter by concluding a triple alliance between the company, the nizam of Hyderabad, and the peshwa. Given the mutual antipathy between these two Indian powers, the alliance was something of a coup. Malet was instrumental in bringing it to fruition in June 1790 after difficult negotiations and despite the counter-efforts of Tipu's <i>vakils</i> in Poona. In February 1791 Malet was created a baronet as a reward for achieving the treaty. The alliance removed the initiative from Tipu in the military campaigns of 1790&#150;92, although Mysore was defeated but not destroyed. Malet had observed to Cornwallis in 1790 that, if Tipu was removed, the company would be drawn into &#145;an intricate and almost inextricable labyrinth of controversy and altercation&#146; with the nizam and the Marathas over the settlement of Mysore  (Forrest, 129&#150;30, 193).<br>
<br>Malet was also concerned to counter French intrigue in western and southern India, especially after the outbreak of the revolutionary war in 1793. By now he had a well-established reputation and style. In 1796 Walter Ewer told Dundas that Malet &#145;was fit for the highest station in India &hellip; and he has a good deal of the Asiatick State about him, is very fond of shew and I should imagine may be easily gained with Titles or gaudy honors&#146;  (Nightingale, 137). He remained resident at Poona until 1797, became a member of the council at Bombay, and served for a while as acting governor of the presidency.<br>
<br>Malet retired to Britain in 1798 accompanied by Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1868), daughter of the portrait painter James Wales, whom he had befriended while in India. The couple married on 17 September the following year and had eight sons. Malet retained his interest in India and was instrumental in helping, with the artist Thomas Daniell, in the publication of some of Wales's works, most notably those of the caves at Ellora. In 1801 Malet published an article in <span class="italic">Asiatic Researches</span> on the architectural and historical features of the same caves. He was created a fellow of the Royal Society and fellow of the Society of Arts, and died at Bath on 24 January 1815, when he was described as living at Wilbury House, Wiltshire  (<span class="italic">GM</span>).<br>
<br>Malet was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_17874"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Malet</span>, second baronet  (1800&#150;1886), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, who was born on 23 July 1800 at Hartham Park, Wiltshire, and educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1822. He entered the British diplomatic service in 1824 as an unpaid attach&eacute; and went to St Petersburg. Here he was an eyewitness to the military insurrection that took place on the accession of Tsar Nicholas in 1825. Malet now began his rise through the lower grades of the service, serving next as secretary of legation at Lisbon, under Lord Howden, during the Miguelite War of 1832&#150;4.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1834 Malet married Mary Anne (or Marianne) Dora (1810?&#150;1891), daughter of John Spalding and stepdaughter of Henry, Baron Brougham; the couple had two sons, Henry Charles Eden and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34843/', "Edward Baldwin Malet")</script>. Known as &#145;Brougham's petticoat&#146; at the Foreign Office, Mary was ambitious for Malet's advancement and immediately plotted to get her husband made pr&eacute;cis writer to the foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston. This ploy failed, although Palmerston did make Malet secretary of legation at The Hague, where he remained for almost nine years. He was eventually promoted to secretary of the embassy at Vienna and then British minister at W&uuml;rttemberg. In 1849 he was appointed minister-plenipotentiary to the Germanic confederation at Frankfurt. Here he formed a close friendship with Bismarck during a crucial period in German history which ended with the eclipsing of Austrian influence within the confederation and the emergence of a pre-eminent Prussia. Malet's career failed to progress further and, after the collapse of the confederation, in 1866, he retired and was created KCB. He became a magistrate and deputy lieutenant for Wiltshire, where he lived at Wilbury House. In addition to his diplomatic career, he was author of <span class="italic">Some Account of the System of Fagging at Winchester School</span> (1828), an English translation of Wace's <span class="italic">Roman de Rou</span> (1860), and <span class="italic">The Overthrow of the Germanic Confederation by Prussia</span> (1870). He died on 28 November 1886 at his London house at Queensberry Place, Cromwell Road.<br>
<br>Sir Charles Warre Malet's third son was <a name="cosubject_74787"></a><span class="headword">William Wyndham Malet</span>  (1803&#150;1885), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, who held a curacy in Bristol at the time Canon Sydney Smith secured him the living of Ardeley in Hertfordshire. Malet was instituted in 1843 and remained vicar there until his death. A man of firm opinions and acutely conscious of priestly office, he became something of a local character. The Hertfordshire historian J. E. Cussans recorded that &#145;Malet is one of the best men I ever met, but the manner in which he conducts his services strikes strangers with astonishment. He is an ultra Ritualist &hellip; [wearing] &hellip; all the vestments of a Roman Catholic priest&#146;  (Cussans, 104&#150;5). At other times he wore the costume of a Benedictine monk and, although materially well off, he lived plainly and was generous towards the poor, for whom &#145;the doors of the vicarage are always open&#146;  (ibid.). William Upton's <span class="italic">Survey of Hertfordshire Religions</span> in 1847&#150;8 described Malet as &#145;Decidedly Puseyite&#146;  (Burg, 6). Not all of his parishioners agreed with his advocacy of increased money for poor relief, of higher agricultural wages, cheap coal for the poor, and the shifting of the burden of rates from the occupiers to the owners of the village's smaller cottages. Few country parish priests petitioned parliament and the monarch to the extent that he did. Such activities provoked friction between him and his vestry, which considered his sermons on poor relief as &#145;highly dangerous&#146; and a subject for the bishop's attention. Tension also arose over the management of the church buildings and documents, and with the local squires, the Murrays of Ardeley Bury. Malet married Eliza, daughter of E. J. Esdaile, on 9 March 1837; they had four children. No appreciation was recorded on his death on 12 June 1885 after forty-two years' service to the parish. The interesting memorial window in the church was provided by his family and not through any effort of the vestry. Malet was the author of several works, including <span class="italic">An Errand to South in the Summer of 1862</span> (1863) and <span class="italic">The Olive Leaf: a Pilgrimage to Rome, Jerusalem and Constantinople in 1867</span> (1868).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_17877"></a><span class="headword">George Grenville Malet</span>  (1804&#150;1856), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the fourth son of Sir Charles Warre Malet. He entered the 3rd light cavalry in Bombay in 1822 as a cadet and subsequently rose through the ranks, becoming lieutenant-colonel in 1854. In 1824 he took part in the capture of Godhra, Champaner, and Powanghen in Gujarat; in 1832 he served with Lieutenant-Colonel Jervis in Kathiawar against Sirdar Champoaj, and in 1834 in Gujarat once more against rebels in the Mahi Kantha. In 1839 he became the political superintendent of Mellanee, in Rajputana; he took part in the Anglo-Afghan War in 1842, during which he was wounded, and received a silver medal for his services. The year 1843 saw him serving with Sir Charles Napier at Hyderabad in Sind, and in 1844 he was appointed resident at Khairpur, the court of Mir Ali Murad Khan. In 1845 he accompanied Napier and Meer Ali in an expedition against the Baluchi chiefs. Five years later he became superintendent of the Gwalior contingent of horse.<br>
<br>On 31 March 1851 Malet married Mary Fleming, daughter of Colonel John Taylor; they had one son and three daughters. A keen huntsman (particularly of hogs), Malet narrowly escaped death on 26 January 1837 when his head was trapped in a tiger's mouth at the moment the animal was killed by a fellow hunter. Malet wrote a <span class="italic">History of Sind</span> and translated from the Persian of Muhammad M&#145;a. In 1856 he was in command of the 3rd light cavalry in the war with Persia when he was killed at the capture of Bushehr on 9 December.<br>
<br>Sir Charles Warre Malet's fifth son, <a name="cosubject_17875"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Malet</span>  (1806&#150;1888), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and writer</span>, was educated at Winchester College, Addiscombe College, and the East India College at Haileybury. In 1824 he was appointed to the Bombay civil service and took up his duties in 1826. He began his career as assistant collector and then magistrate at Khandesh. He next became assistant to the resident at Baroda, political agent and resident at Cutch in 1842, and agent in Kathiawar in 1843. In 1846 he was appointed secretary to the Bombay government's political and secret department, and then chief secretary in 1847.<br>
<br>Seven years later he became a member of the Indian legislative council and of the Bombay council, and chief judge of the <i>sadr diwani adalat</i> and <i>sadr faujdari adalat</i> in 1857. During the Indian mutiny Malet initiated the defensive works for Bombay (which won him high praise from the governor). In 1860, the year he retired, he devised a land reclamation scheme for Bombay harbour.<br>
<br>Malet was twice married: first (on 3 September 1846) to Mary Sophia, daughter of Sir John Pollard Willoughby, and secondly (in December 1854) to Annie Louise, daughter of G. Powney Thompson of the East India Company service. These marriages produced two sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>Malet published several works, including <span class="italic">A Metrical Version of the Psalms in English</span> (1863), <span class="italic">The Marriage of Solomon: a Drama</span> (1876), and <span class="italic">The Books of Job, Ecclesiastes and Revelation in English Verse</span> (1883). He was also a keen family historian and compiled, in 1885, <span class="italic">Notices of an English Branch of the Malet Family</span>. He died on 13 September 1888.<br>
