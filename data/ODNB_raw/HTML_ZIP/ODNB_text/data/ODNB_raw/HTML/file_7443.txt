<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Delany,  Patrick</span>  (1685/6&#150;1768), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland dean of Down and writer</span>, was born at Rathkreagh in Queen's county, a younger son of Denis Delany, a small farmer. He was educated at the popular school run by Dalton at Athy in co. Kildare, whence he proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1701. He was elected a scholar of the foundation in 1704. Later Delany paid tribute to the excellent grounding he received there from the then provost, Peter Browne. To Browne he traced his taste in the classics, his style in preaching, and perhaps his concern with charity. He continued beyond his BA (taken in 1706) and MA (1709) to prepare for ordination. In 1709 he was elected to a fellowship of the college. At this stage his political leanings towards the tories assisted his ascent. By 1713 he was a chaplain to the intemperate tory lord chancellor, Sir Constantine Phipps. Delany's toryism proved less helpful after 1714 but his reputation as the foremost tutor in the college and one of the best preachers in Dublin protected him. In 1724 he was appointed professor of oratory and history. The following year Archbishop Hugh Boulter calculated that Delany earned &pound;600 or &pound;700 from his pupils. Boulter, keen to see Delany's influence within the college diminished, refused to allow him to combine a fellowship with the incumbency of a Dublin parish (St John's). However in 1728, backed by Dean Swift and the lord lieutenant, Carteret, he received the chancellorship of Christ Church Cathedral in the capital. Within two years he added the chancellorship of Dublin's second cathedral, St Patrick's. He was also inducted into a college living in co. Fermanagh.<br>
<br>With access to these prominent pulpits Delany was able to consolidate his position as a leading preacher. Concurrently he was active in the cultural and social life of protestant Dublin. Friendly with Swift, even before his formal link with the cathedral of which the latter was dean, Delany turned his hand to verse and periodic journalism as well as to sermons. Later, in 1754, he published a refutation of Lord Orrery's criticisms of Swift. With a colleague from Trinity, Dr Richard Helsham, Delany built a suburban retreat outside Dublin, subsequently renamed Delville. There sociability was consciously (even self-consciously) cultivated. Delany, a byword for hospitality, managed his ample emoluments badly. Difficulties were eased by a timely marriage in 1732 to Margaret Tenison, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barton, the rich widow of a co. Louth landowner. She brought her new husband an annual income of &pound;1600. After her death in 1742 problems over her will involved Delany in protracted litigation, which had not been resolved by the time he died. Earlier his expansive tastes could be indulged not just at Delville but in his Dublin town house in Stafford Street. Each Thursday seven or eight friends would gather. Both the conversation and the restrained refreshment were remembered affectionately. Here he practised those virtues, such as contentment and happiness, that he extolled in print. Integral to his philosophy was an ideal of moderation. Virtue and piety, he firmly believed, were most likely to be found among those &#145;in the middle state&#146;  (P. Delany, <span class="italic">Sixteen Discourses</span>, 1754, 235).<br>
<br>From the 1730s Delany wrote more ambitious works than the slight verses that he had previously published. In 1732 he published an attack on contemporary education, <span class="italic">The Present State of Learning</span>, under an easily penetrated pseudonym. He lamented the neglect of classical literature and contempt for the scriptures among feeble imitators of Newton. He feared that this attitude had affected some clergy who no longer behaved as if they were addressing &#145;corrupt, unruly mortals&#146; but &#145;pure, unbodied intelligences&#146;  (P. Delany, <span class="italic">The Present State of Learning</span>, 1732, 7&#150;8). &#145;Profane scurrility&#146; was instead the favoured mode. At the same time fashionable lay people treated church services as a kind of entertainment. This assault was incorporated into a more comprehensive restatement of the tenets of orthodox Christianity in <span class="italic">Revelation Examined with Candour</span>, which appeared in three volumes between 1732 and 1763. Despite the persisting doubts about his political reliability Delany was invited to preach on state occasions. His sermon in 1738 on the anniversary of Charles I's execution was acclaimed by Swift for its refusal to compromise. Delany urged all Christians to obey the current sovereign and warned that republican ideas &#145;must end, as they are intended, in popery and arbitrary power&#146;  (P. Delany, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd in Christ-Church, Dublin, &hellip; on Monday, January 30, 1737 [8]</span>, 1737 [8], 19). In the same decade he was tempted to examine and attack the practice of polygamy. He analysed both ancient and modern empires to disprove the contention that the habit increased population more rapidly than monogamy; he had been aided in demonstrating this by the demographic calculations of his friend Dr Helsham. He also published a three-volume life of King David (Dublin, 1743), whom he promoted as the exemplar of friendship, an attribute to which he often reverted. Characteristically the study was designed to improve, entertain, and inform.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1743 Delany married, as his second wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Granville (1700&#150;1788), widow of Alexander Pendarves and the elder daughter of Bernard and Mary Granville [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7442/', "Delany, Mary")</script>]; her mother was an artist with wide court and society connections. Thanks to her persistence and connections Delany was advanced in 1744 to the deanery of Down, where (to his wife's chagrin) he stuck. Vacant bishoprics eluded him. The revenues of the deanery were reckoned to be &pound;2300 per annum, however, and Delany's wish to retain his other preferments irritated his superiors. It was part of an attitude to the clerical calling, idealistic in the abstract but personally lax, notably over the question of residence. He spent long periods in England and, as his health worsened in the 1760s, so he contracted his circuit to Dublin and its environs. Yet he publicly espoused a number of causes dear to the interests of the established Church of Ireland. A noted educationist himself, he often adverted to the importance of proper schooling. Good schoolmasters, he contended, were among the most useful members of any society. He reminded the young at Trinity College of the value of early industry. He inveighed against parents who neglected the education of their children or entrusted them to ignorant servants and foreign tutors. He wanted women to be educated so that they were better prepared for becoming faithful friends and amiable companions of their husbands (in the mode&#151;no doubt&#151;of his own wife). He backed the Incorporated Society and its charter schools as helps to the poor. More contentiously he upheld the rights of the clergy to their tithes. At Down he became embroiled in a battle to extract tithes from the local linen weavers; although he contended that only disinterested zeal for the rights of the church motivated him he found himself opposed not just by the weavers but also by the official linen board and powerful landowners.<br>
<br>On entering into the deanery of Down Delany tried to rectify the neglects of his predecessors and planned to visit all the families within the district. He wanted to build new churches and a fitting residence for himself and his successors. In his rented house at Mount Panther, outside Downpatrick, as well as at Delville, he and his wife personified the social virtues that he so frequently recommended. In manner of life, avoiding ostentation, he continued to merit Swift's tribute that he made &#145;no parade&#146; and was &#145;one of the very few within my knowledge on whom a great access of fortune hath made no manner of change&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.104). He continued to combat vicious habits common among the leaders of society; thus duelling, gambling, excess in dress, diet, and drink, cheating, avarice, envy, and pride were all attacked in his publications. On occasion too he voiced something of the patriotism increasing among aggrieved Irish protestants. In a sermon of 1744 he regretted the deluded English policies that had led to constant economic discrimination against Ireland. He insisted that the interests of the protestants of Ireland were inseparable from those of their co-religionists in Great Britain. He wanted this fact to be recognized in more generous treatment of Ireland by the Westminster parliament. Ironically, in view of his own lineage (seemingly of native Irish stock), he insisted that there were not ten notable families in Ireland &#145;who are not originally British&#146;  (P. Delany, <span class="italic">A Sermon Preach'd before the Society Corresponding with the Incorporated Society in Dublin &hellip; March 13<sup>th</sup>, 1743/4</span>, 1744, 15). His voluminous writings, economical and direct in style, convey something of the reasons why he was so esteemed as mentor and preacher.<br>
<br>In a quest for restoratives Delany revisited England, where&#151;at Bath&#151;he died on 6 May 1768. His body was returned to Ireland to be interred at Glasnevin, close to his favourite haunt of Delville.<br>
