<span class="headword">Phipps,  Constantine John</span>, second Baron Mulgrave in the peerage of Ireland and Baron Mulgrave in the peerage of Great Britain  (1744&#150;1792), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born in London on 30 May 1744, the eldest son of Constantine Phipps (<i>bap</i>. 1722, <i>d</i>. 1775) and his wife, Lepell (1723&#150;1780), daughter of John, first Lord Hervey. His father inherited substantial property, including Mulgrave Castle, Yorkshire, from the duke of Buckingham, and in 1766 was created Baron Mulgrave in the Irish peerage during his brother-in-law Lord Bristol's six-month tenure of the lord lieutenancy of Ireland. Phipps attended Eton College from 1755 to 1758, and in January 1759 went to sea with his uncle Captain the Hon. Augustus Hervey. On 17 March 1762, still with Hervey but by this time in the West Indies, he was promoted lieutenant by George Brydges Rodney. Four months later he was wounded in the bold attack which Hervey led on the Morro Castle at Havana. On 24 November 1763 he was promoted commander of the sloop <i>Diligence</i>, and on 20 June 1765 he became captain of the frigate <i>Terpsichore</i>. Next year he visited Newfoundland and Labrador with his old schoolfriend Joseph Banks the botanist. Already known for his scientific interests, Phipps was in 1773 appointed (by the Admiralty board, which included his uncle Augustus) to command the bomb vessels <i>Racehorse</i> and <i>Carcass</i> on an expedition to test the theory that in the open sea the Arctic Ocean might be largely free of ice, and offer a route to the Pacific. It did not, of course, and Phipps barely extricated his ships from the ice, but the expedition nevertheless marks an important stage in the progress from exploration to research, and most of his published report is taken up with detailed appendices on its scientific work.<br>
<br>As MP for Lincoln from 1768 to 1774 Phipps was prominent in opposition, but he was impressed by the experience of working on the Arctic expedition with Lord Sandwich, the first lord of the Admiralty, and in 1775 a political connection was formed between them through the good offices of their mutual friend Banks. In January 1776 Lord Mulgrave (as Phipps had become on his father's death the previous September) was elected to the Huntingdon seat vacated by the death of Sandwich's son, and in December 1777 he joined the Admiralty board. From then until the fall of the North ministry in April 1782 Mulgrave was the Admiralty's principal speaker in the Commons, and one of Sandwich's closest colleagues. &#145;How much I long for your return to town&#146;, Sandwich wrote in January 1779, &#145;and how lamely business goes on in your absence; when anything in which this office is concerned comes to be agitated in Parliament, I really know not what we shall do without your assistance&#146;  (Mulgrave Castle MSS). As a speaker Mulgrave was solid rather than brilliant, but his obvious mastery of his subject seldom failed to convince even a hostile chamber, and he carried a heavy load of parliamentary business. Yet officers were not expected to abandon their sea careers because they sat in the Commons, or at the Admiralty. In 1776 Mulgrave took command of the line-of-battle ship <i>Ardent</i>, followed in the spring of 1778 by the <i>Courageux</i>, in which he distinguished himself at the battle of Ushant in July, and continued to serve throughout the war under Augustus Keppel, Sir Charles Hardy the younger, Sir Francis Geary, Robert Digby, and finally Lord Howe&#151;successive commanders-in-chief of the Channel Fleet, each of whom (excepting the last) took their orders from the board of which he was an active member.<br>
<br>After the resignation of Sir Hugh Palliser in April 1779 Mulgrave was the leading naval member of the board, and Sandwich's principal adviser in all professional matters. The situation was a remarkable one, of which we are particularly well informed because so much of Mulgrave's Admiralty work had to be done by letter while he was at sea, and both he and Sandwich were methodical in keeping their correspondence. As a strategist he was the main architect of the December 1777 plan to abandon the American War of Independence as a sideshow and strike in the West Indies before the French could intervene, which might have changed the course of the war if the ministry had pursued it wholeheartedly. He was deeply involved in managing the crises of 1779 and 1781 when apparently overwhelming Franco-Spanish fleets entered the channel. In June 1781 he was himself named to command a large-scale raid on Flushing, which had to be cancelled at the last minute. By then he was elaborating the bold and perhaps foolhardy strategy which the North ministry adopted, and would have put into effect in 1782 had it not fallen, of moving the main fleet to the Caribbean and leaving only minimal forces to hold the channel and North Sea.<br>
<br>Although ejected from the Admiralty with Sandwich in March 1782, Mulgrave continued to serve at sea until the end of the war. He remained part of Sandwich's party until December 1783, but they differed over Charles James Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span>, and William Pitt was able to win him to the new administration. At the general election in April 1784 he was brought in for a government seat at Newark, and given the lucrative office of joint paymaster-general. In May he was appointed to both the Board of Trade and the Board of Control. He continued a minor but active member of the Pitt administration, and in May 1788, when Lord Chatham became first lord of the Admiralty, Mulgrave was considered for the post of controller of the navy. On 7 July 1790 he was made a peer of Great Britain as Baron Mulgrave, but in the following year he was compelled by ill health to resign his offices. Mulgrave had not married until 20 June 1787, his wife being Anne Elizabeth Cholmley (1769&#150;1788), daughter of the Yorkshire gentleman and former MP Nathaniel Cholmley of Howsham. She died in childbirth the following year, leaving a daughter who was Mulgrave's only heir. He died at Li&egrave;ge on 10 October 1792, when his English barony became extinct, and his Irish title passed to his brother Henry. He was buried at Lythe, Yorkshire, on 29 October.<br>
<br>Mulgrave was not an original thinker; his conventional attitude to the rewards of office and influence caused the reforming Sandwich some embarrassment, and he vainly opposed the introduction of carronades, a new type of gun which played a significant part in the navy's recovery from the worst days of the American war. In his virtues, however, he was typical of Sandwich's naval followers; he was not showy or well known, but a thorough seaman with a deep knowledge of the navy, who built up the finest naval library in England and founded his political position on his professional mastery.<br>
