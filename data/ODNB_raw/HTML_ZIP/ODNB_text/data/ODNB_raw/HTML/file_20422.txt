</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oakeley, Sir  Charles</span>, first baronet  (1751&#150;1826), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, second son of William Oakeley (<i>d</i>. 1803), rector of Forton, Staffordshire, and his wife, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1790), daughter of Sir Patrick Strachan, was born at the rectory, Forton, on 27 February 1751. After attending Shrewsbury School, he obtained, through his father's friend, Lady Clive, a nomination to a writership on the East India Company's Madras establishment. He was appointed in October 1766, and arrived in Madras on 6 June 1767. For five or six years he was assistant to the secretary to the civil department; in January 1773 he was promoted to succeed Mr Goodlad in the secretaryship; and in May 1777 he was given the corresponding post in the military and political department, combined with the offices of judge advocate-general and translator. That year, on 19 October, he married Helena (<i>d</i>. 1839), only daughter of Robert Beatson of Kilrie, Fife, a woman of great energy and artistic talent. Oakeley's superiors noted his diligence, but he was compelled to resign in November 1780 because of ill health.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1781, when Lord Macartney, the governor of Madras, had succeeded in obtaining from the nawab of Arcot an assignment of his revenues to defray the expenses of the war in the Carnatic, a committee, called the committee of assigned revenue, was appointed to superintend the collection of the revenues. Of this committee Oakeley was made president. He began his duties in January 1782. In spite of the hostility of the nawab's servants and subjects, and of the great extent of Haidar Ali's conquests in the territories of the nawab, the board succeeded in raising the Arcot contribution to the war fund from 1&frac14; <i>pagodas</i> to nearly 44 <i>pagodas</i>. Most of this was used to feed the company's army, but a considerable surplus was handed over to the nawab on the conclusion of the war in March 1784. For these services the committee was publicly thanked by the governor-general and the council of Bengal; and even Burke, in his speech &#145;on the Nabob of Arcot's debts&#146; spoke of its services in high terms.<br>
<br>Oakeley's achievements in Arcot led to his appointment in April 1786 by Sir Archibald Campbell to the presidency of the new board of revenue of Madras. Family affairs, however, compelled him to resign early in 1788, and in February 1789 he sailed for Europe on board the <i>Manship</i>. Although he had been twenty-two years in India, he still lacked seniority in membership in the council, so had little expectation of promotion. Pitt and Dundas, however, to whom Campbell had recommended him, pressed him to return, and, the court of directors having in 1789 placed on record its high appreciation of his services, he was in April 1790 appointed to succeed General Medows as governor of Madras, and was also gazetted a baronet on 5 June. It was expected that Medows would be transferred to the governorship of Bengal, and Oakeley was accordingly sworn in as governor. But when the news arrived of the outbreak of fresh hostilities with Tipu Sultan, Medows's transfer was postponed, and Oakeley was placed second in council at Madras. He arrived in Madras on 15 October 1790 and, finding General Medows in the field, assumed, in his absence, charge of the civil administration of Madras, a task made doubly difficult by the great and constant needs of the army, and the extreme financial embarrassment of the company's Madras exchequer. As this was largely due to lack of public confidence in the government, Oakeley, instead of borrowing from Bengal or Europe, proceeded to improve the administration of Madras. He retrenched expenses, enforced a more efficient collection of revenue, and exacted a subsidy of 10 lakhs (Rs 1 million) per annum from the raja of Travancore, on the grounds that the company was defending him against Tipu. But perhaps the measure which most tended to restore public credit was the resumption of cash payments for all army and public obligations, which had previously been made only in the case of the most pressing debts. The only exception which he made was in the case of his own official salary, which remained unpaid until the close of the war, though he had meantime to borrow money at 12 per cent for his own private expenses.<br>
<br>These measures were taken only just in time. On 26 May 1791 Lord Cornwallis, the governor-general, had come south to take charge of the army, but was forced to retire from Seringapatam, destroying his battering train for lack of transport. Heavy requisitions were consequently made on the Madras government for draught cattle, stores, and funds. Fortunately, Oakeley's reforms had enabled the presidency revenue to meet a large portion of the expenses of the war: Cornwallis's needs were promptly and amply met. Oakeley poured into the field of operations money, grain, and cattle. Cornwallis recognized the value of this assistance, and the Bengal presidency benefited greatly by the ability of Madras to bear so large a part of the burden. On the conclusion of the war in March 1792 General Medows left Madras, and Oakeley entered on the full authority of governor. Cornwallis did not, in fact, have a very high opinion of Oakeley's ability to carry out needed reforms in Madras, but he concluded that at least he was the best of the company's servants  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of &hellip; Cornwallis</span>, 2.170).<br>
<br>Oakeley first attacked the question of the company's debt. Accordingly, when the news reached India, in June 1793, of the outbreak of war with France, a fully equipped army was promptly dispatched against Pondicherry, and 5 lakhs of <i>pagodas</i> (about Rs 1,750,000) remitted to Bengal without damaging the government's credit. The Pondicherry expedition was planned and directed by the Madras government, and had in fact been undertaken on Oakeley's own responsibility some weeks in advance of instructions from Britain, and as soon as the news of the outbreak of war arrived overland. It was successfully completed by the fall of Pondicherry in August 1793. On 7 September 1794 Oakeley handed over the government to Lord Hobart. He returned to England, where he received, on 5 August 1795, the thanks of the court of directors for his eminent services. Not the least of these was his revenue work, which, however painful its immediate impact on the peasants, laid the foundation for a modern system of government in the Madras region.<br>
<br>Always much attached to the region in which he had spent his early years, Oakeley settled at The Abbey, Shrewsbury, near his father, who was now rector of Holy Cross, Shrewsbury, and lived there until in 1810 he moved to the bishop's palace, Lichfield. A seat in parliament had been offered him by Sir William Pulteney during his visit to England in 1789, but the offer was declined. Shortly after his final return he was informally sounded as to his willingness to be considered for the governor-generalship; this he also declined. He corresponded with Dundas on Indian affairs from time to time, but for the most part occupied himself with classical studies and with the education of his sons. At the time of the expected invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte, Oakeley commanded a volunteer regiment of foot raised in Shrewsbury.<br>
<br>Although he had served the East India Company in Madras at a time when it was a byword for corruption and oppression, people who knew him after his return to England spoke of his &#145;fervent and unaffected piety&#146; and his generosity in support of local charitable institutions  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 371). Having been acquainted with the educational work in Madras of Dr Andrew Bell, he assisted in the establishment of the National Society's schools on Bell's system in Shrewsbury and Lichfield. He died at his home, the bishop's palace, Lichfield, on 7 September 1826, and was buried privately at Forton. There is a monument to his memory by Chantrey in Lichfield Cathedral.<br>
<br>The Oakeleys had eleven children, ten of whom survived him, including his sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20424/', "Sir Herbert Oakeley")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20423/', "Frederick Oakeley")</script>; a third son, Henry, became a judge of the supreme court, Calcutta, and predeceased his father by a few months, dying on 2 May 1826.<br>
