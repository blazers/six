<span class="headword">Cockburn,  James Pattison</span>  (1779&#150;1847), <span class="occ">army officer and watercolour painter</span>, was born on 18 March 1779 in New York, the son of Colonel John Cockburn and his wife, Mary, daughter of Colonel Sir James Cockburn. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet on 19 March 1793, and passed out, as a second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, on 2 March 1795; his promotions were: first lieutenant (1803), captain (1806), brevet major (1814), lieutenant-colonel (1825), brevet colonel (1837), and major-general (9 November 1846). He served at the capture of the Cape of Good Hope in 1795, in the expedition sent against Manila in 1798 but was recalled when on its passage owing to the threatening situation in the Carnatic, and also at the siege and capture of Copenhagen in 1807. In 1800 he married, at Cape Colony, Elizabeth Johanna Vansittart; they had five sons and two daughters. From November 1822 to June 1823 he visited Lower Canada. On 5 April 1826 he was given command of the Royal Artillery in the Canadas, to which he returned in August 1826; he left in August 1832. He was director of the Royal Laboratory, Woolwich, from 10 October 1838 to 15 November 1846, when he retired with the rank of major-general.<br>
<br>As a cadet Cockburn had been a pupil of Paul Sandby, Royal Academician (who was for many years professor of landscape drawing at the Royal Military Academy), and became an accomplished and prolific artist, whose work was exhibited and engraved. During leave from Malta and Woolwich, where he was stationed after 1815, he made many drawings of continental scenery, which were engraved and published as <span class="italic">Swiss Scenery</span> (1820) with sixty-two plates; <span class="italic">Views of the Valley of Aosta</span> (1822) with twenty-nine plates; <span class="italic">Views to Illustrate the Simplon Route</span> (1822) with fifty plates; and <span class="italic">Views to Illustrate the Mont Cenis Route</span> (1822). These drawings supplied the continental &#145;scenes&#146; for illustrated editions, annuals, and similar works long afterwards. He also executed the landscapes in Professor T. L. Donaldson's <span class="italic">Pompeii Illustrated</span> (1829). He painted Canadian scenes (collections of his work are in Canadian galleries and museums), and in 1831 published anonymously a small &#145;picturesque guide&#146; (with seven plates) to the town of Quebec and its environs. According to Ludwig Spohr, who met Cockburn when travelling, he &#145;made use of a machine, which transmitted the landscape on a reduced scale to the paper&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 309)&#151;presumably a camera lucida.<br>
<br>Cockburn, who had long been in feeble health, died at his residence, at Woolwich Common, Kent, on 18 March 1847.<br>
