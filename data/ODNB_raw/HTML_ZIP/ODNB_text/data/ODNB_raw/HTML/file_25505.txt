<span class="headword">Sibson,  Francis</span>  (1814&#150;1876), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 21 May 1814 at Cross Canonby, Cumberland, the third of the five sons of Francis and Jane Sibson. His family moved to Edinburgh in 1819, where he was baptized at St Peter's Episcopal Church. Aged fourteen he was apprenticed to the surgeon John Lizars. He received his diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh on 21 December 1831. During the cholera epidemics of 1831&#150;2 he worked in cholera wards in Leith, Newhaven, and Edinburgh. Following a brief period in general practice in Cockermouth he continued his medical studies at Guy's Hospital, London, coming under the influence of the physician Thomas Hodgkin.<br>
<br>In 1835 Sibson was appointed resident surgeon and apothecary at Nottingham General Hospital. During his thirteen years at Nottingham he laid the foundations of his subsequent anatomical and clinical research. His 1844 paper, &#145;On changes induced in the situation and structure of the internal organs under varying circumstances of health and disease&#146;, gained him professional repute. His acquaintance with the naturalist Charles Waterton encouraged his interest in the action of narcotics, especially curare, in the treatment of hydrophobia and tetanus. A prolific yet careful writer, he published papers on the mechanics of respiration, the blowhole of the porpoise, the treatment of gout and rheumatism, the use of ether and chloroform in the treatment of neuralgia, and the 1847 typhoid epidemic in Nottingham.<br>
<br>Funded by a testimonial from his supporters in Nottingham, Sibson moved to London in 1848, taking a first in the University of London MB in 1848 and the MD in 1849. He was elected a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1849 and a fellow in 1853. His election as fellow of the Royal Society in 1849 recognized his painstakingly accurate work on the anatomy of the healthy and diseased viscera. Establishing his own practice in Brook Street in 1849 he began a well-attended series of demonstrations in visceral anatomy. He also lectured at Samuel Armstrong Lane's school of anatomy in Grosvenor Place. Four lecturers from Lane's school, including Sibson as physician, were elected to the honorary staff when St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, which Lane had promoted, opened in 1851. Planned as a teaching hospital from its foundation, St Mary's opened its medical school in 1854 with Sibson as lecturer on medicine.<br>
<br>In 1858 Sibson married Sarah Mary Ouvry, younger daughter of Peter Aim&eacute; Ouvry of East Acton. They hospitably hosted regular breakfast parties for his medical firms at their home, where prayers might punctuate a discussion of a post-mortem. A fair, broad-shouldered athletic man of middle height, he was noted for his obsessive punctuality and intolerance of tardiness. An art connoisseur, he collected Wedgwood china and architectural drawings.<br>
<br>An inspirational clinical teacher and accurate diagnostician, Sibson showed little interest in therapeutics, uniformly prescribing tincture of perchloride of iron regardless of his own precise and painstaking diagnosis. His main interests lay in cardiac, renal, and pulmonary disease. His practice of keeping interesting cases of aortic aneurysm on the wards for months brought conflict with the board of governors keen for earlier discharge of patients blocking beds. His enthusiastic lecturing and bedside teaching on ward rounds were backed by the relish which this morbid anatomist showed in autopsies. His cases at St Mary's Hospital provided the raw materials for his 1869 book <span class="italic">Medical anatomy, or, Illustrations of the relative position and movements of the internal organs</span>.<br>
<br>Sibson was a member of the council of the Royal Society, 1872&#150;4, and joint treasurer of the Royal Society Club. He was successively Goulstonian, Croonian, and Lumleian lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians. He was curator of the museum of the Royal College of Physicians and censor in 1874. A member of the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association from 1843, he was initially opposed to its transformation to the British Medical Association but became the latter association's president in 1866, and held the post until 1869. He was elected to the senate of the University of London in 1865 and opposed the admission of women to its degrees as fervently as he led the opposition to a suggestion that St Mary's Hospital medical school admit women medical students in 1869. He was, nevertheless, a supporter of the training of nurses. An active member of the Metropolitan Asylums Board from 1875, he was involved in the planning of isolation hospitals.<br>
<br>Sibson, an ardent mountaineer, died suddenly at the Hotel des Bergues, Geneva, during his annual holiday on 7 September 1876 from an aortic aneurysm, ironically the main focus of his research. He was buried in St Mary's churchyard, Acton, Middlesex.<br>
