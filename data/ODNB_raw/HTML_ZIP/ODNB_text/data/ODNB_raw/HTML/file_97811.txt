<span class="headword">Schofield <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Smith; <em>other married name </em>Matheson]</span>,  Sylvia Anne Terry</span>  (1916&#150;2006), <span class="occ">writer and traveller</span>, was born on 28 May 1916 at 113 Ramsden Road, Balham, London, the elder daughter of William Horace Smith, architect and chartered surveyor, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Terry, a Salvation Army officer. Her father took the name Terry-Smith when his office began sharing a building with the stationer W. H. Smith; she became known as Sylvia Terry-Smith. She left Wimbledon Technical College at the age of sixteen, but took evening classes at Wimbledon School of Art while working as a freelance journalist.<br>
<br>After the outbreak of the Second World War Sylvia Terry-Smith joined the monitoring service of the BBC, where she met Angus Matheson (1912&#150;1962), son of Malcolm Matheson, a minister in the Outer Hebrides. They married at Kingston and Surbiton Presbyterian Church on 19 December 1941, and although the marriage ended in divorce in 1950 she later published all her non-fiction books under the name Sylvia A. Matheson. A monitor at the BBC at the time of their marriage, Angus Matheson went on to become professor of Celtic languages and literatures at the University of Glasgow. After her transfer to the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office, the cover name for the political warfare executive, Sylvia Matheson prepared news reports and wrote propaganda pamphlets to be dropped behind enemy lines. Shortly before the end of the war she went to Florence as a field correspondent attached to the headquarters of General Mark Clark, commander-in-chief of the allied forces in Italy, and in May 1945 she witnessed the unconditional surrender of all the German troops in Italy.<br>
<br>Interested in Asia ever since she was a child, Sylvia Matheson went to India after the war, working as a journalist and advertising copywriter, and in 1946 made her first visit to Baluchistan. After collecting potsherds and beads at a prehistoric site at Nushki, in the Chagai district of Baluchistan, she took her collection to Delhi to Mortimer Wheeler, director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India, and he suggested she take it to London, to the Institute of Archaeology and the British Museum. This led to a year's study of field archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, before she took a job as a copywriter with the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. But she never gave up the idea of going back to Asia, and in 1955 she accepted an invitation from the leader of the prehistoric section of the French archaeological delegation in Afghanistan to join an excavation of a site dating back to 3000 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> at Mundigak, near Kandahar, in Afghanistan. She described her five months in the high, bare, mountainous, desert area in <span class="italic">Time off to Dig</span> (1961), not so much an account of the excavations as a description of her travels, her French colleagues, and the Afghan workers and their families, the meals and parties, and the scorpions, beetles, and ants. As Wheeler wrote in his introduction to the book, &#145;all that the professional archaeologist ignores in his record is here chronicled with shameless gusto&#146;  (<span class="italic">Time off to Dig</span>, 9). She left Mundigak feeling that she had caught a glimpse of the lives of people who had lived there two or three thousand years before the birth of Christ. While still in Afghanistan she was asked by <span class="italic">The Times</span> to report on the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchov to Kabul: as part of the entertainment there was a performance of the ancient game of <i>buzkashi</i>&#151;&#145;dropping the goat&#146;&#151;a game so rough it had been banned in Russia. Involving teams of horsemen armed with whips, and a dead goat, the game is described in great detail in <span class="italic">Time off to Dig</span>.<br>
<br>Before returning to London in December 1955 Sylvia Matheson flew to the recently discovered Sui gas field, the first and largest natural gas field to be developed in Pakistan, in the Bugti tribal area, to prepare a talk for the BBC and a piece for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. There she met, and in 1956 married, Henry Beaumont Schofield (1916&#150;1990), a petroleum engineer in charge of exploiting the gas field for Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. During her five years there, living in the middle of one of the world's hottest deserts, she travelled around Baluchistan accompanied by her personal bodyguard, Mohammed Mondrani of Mut, a famous murderer. As well as chronicling and photographing local tribal customs, she recorded ancient songs, and also songs commemorating recent events such as the discovery of the Sui gas field and the arrival of the company. She described these experiences in <span class="italic">The Tigers of Baluchistan</span> (1967).<br>
<br>Sylvia Schofield and her husband left Baluchistan in 1961, when he was posted to Burma, and after Burma nationalized the oil industry they moved to Assam for a year, before returning to England. During these years she published four <span class="roman">Crime Club</span> novels under the pseudonym Max Mundy (the name of her dog), adventure thrillers featuring a news photographer named Russell Jones. <span class="italic">Death is a Tiger</span> (1960) was based on her experiences in Baluchistan, <span class="italic">Dig for a Corpse</span> (1962) was set in the mountains of central Asia, <span class="italic">Pagan Pagoda</span> (1965) in Burma, and <span class="italic">Death Cries Ol&eacute;</span> (1966) in Spain. From 1967 until 1979 they lived in Iran, leaving at the time of the revolution. She published <span class="italic">Persia: an Archaeological Guide</span> (1972), a guide to sites and excavations from prehistoric times to the end of Seljuk rule, most of which she had visited herself, followed by <span class="italic">Leathercraft in the Lands of Ancient Persia</span> (1978); she also travelled as a lecturer for the cruise company, Swan Hellenic. In 1979 they moved to Abu Dhabi.<br>
<br>Following Henry Schofield's retirement in 1981, he and Sylvia moved to a villa in Javea on the costa blanca in Spain. She continued to lead tours to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, and in 1984 published <span class="italic">Rajasthan, Land of Kings</span>, a big, glossy book about the history, art, handicrafts, costumes, and religion of Rajasthan, lavishly illustrated with photographs by Roloff Beny. At the end of her life she suffered from failing eyesight, and spent her final years in the Finca San Antonio nursing home near Sagra, Benissa, Alicante, Spain. She donated her collection of archaeological items from Baluchistan and Afghanistan to the Soler Blasco Museum in Javea. She died in the Finca San Antonio nursing home on 2 March 2006.<br>
