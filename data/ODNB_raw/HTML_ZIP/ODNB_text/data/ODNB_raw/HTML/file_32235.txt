<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cadogan,  George Henry</span>, fifth Earl Cadogan  (1840&#150;1915), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born at Durham on 9 May 1840. He was the eldest son of Henry Charles Cadogan, the fourth earl (1812&#150;1873), and his wife, Mary Sarah (1808&#150;1873), daughter of Gerald Valerian Wellesley (prebendary of Durham and brother of the first duke of Wellington) and his wife, Emily Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sloane. He was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, and as a young man accompanied the prince of Wales on various tours at home and abroad. At the general election of 1868, as Viscount Chelsea, he stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative for Bury. He was elected for Bath in 1873, but in the same year went to the House of Lords as Earl Cadogan in consequence of his father's death. Disraeli made him under-secretary of state for war in 1875, and under-secretary for the colonies in 1878. During the second Salisbury administration (1886&#150;1892) he was lord privy seal, and responsible for Irish business in the House of Lords. In the session of 1887 he introduced the <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> of that year, and in April he joined the cabinet. At this time he advised Queen Victoria with respect to her domestic affairs. For his political and other services he received the Garter in July 1891.<br>
<br>When the third Salisbury administration was formed (June 1895) Cadogan became lord lieutenant of Ireland with a seat in the cabinet. He was warmly interested in G. W. Balfour's <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1896, and pressed the Treasury until he obtained more liberal terms of purchase for Irish tenants than that department was at first inclined to allow. Afterwards he turned to the subject of Irish education. He appointed commissions to investigate intermediate education (1899) and university education (1901); and he sponsored the act of 1899 which created a new department of agriculture, industries, and technical instruction for Ireland. He dealt quietly but firmly with the demonstrations which were stimulated in Ireland by the South African War. He was accused of weakness by <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1902), which drew an unfavourable and unfair contrast between his views and those of the chief secretary, George Wyndham, who had succeeded Gerald Balfour in 1900. But Cadogan enjoyed the full confidence of Lord Salisbury, by whom he was twice dissuaded from resigning. Though he was in favour of pacifying agrarian discontent by the concessions embodied in the Wyndham <span class="roman">Land Bill</span> of 1902, he consistently urged the cabinet to coerce disaffected areas and to proceed against seditious newspapers. He resigned in July 1902, at the same time as Lord Salisbury, and retired into private life.<br>
<br>Cadogan was one of those peers to gain spectacularly from urban property at the end of the century. In 1880 he owned about 800 acres in London, much of it in Chelsea, where he was lord of the manor. Against the trend, he extended his agricultural holdings, buying the Culford estate in Suffolk for &pound;175,000 in 1890. In conjunction with Lord Iveagh he spent substantial sums on model dwellings for workmen and on other schemes of social betterment. In 1900 he was elected as the first mayor of Chelsea.<br>
<br>He married twice: first, in 1865, Lady Beatrix Jane Craven (1844&#150;1907), daughter of the second earl of Craven and his wife, Emily Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walter; and second in 1911 at Florence his cousin, Countess Ad&egrave;le Palagi, daughter of Count Neri Palagi and his wife, Olivia Georgiana, daughter of Sir George Cadogan, brother of the fourth earl. With his first wife he had seven sons (one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32234/', "Sir Alexander Cadogan")</script> of the Foreign Office) and two daughters. He died at his home, Chelsea House, Cadogan Place, Chelsea, London on 6 March 1915.<br>
