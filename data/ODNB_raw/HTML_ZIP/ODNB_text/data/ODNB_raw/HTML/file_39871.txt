<span class="headword">Booth,  Catherine  Bramwell-</span>  (1883&#150;1987), <span class="occ">Salvation Army officer</span>, was born on 20 July 1883 at Hadley Wood, Middlesex, the eldest in the family of two sons and five daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31969/', "(William) Bramwell Booth (1856&#150;1929)")</script>, Salvation Army general, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63733/', "Florence Eleanor Booth, n&#233;e Soper (1861&#150;1957)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31969/', "Booth, (William) Bramwell")</script>]. Bramwell was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2874/', "Catherine Booth")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31968/', "General William Booth (1829&#150;1912)")</script>, the founder of the Salvation Army, and both he and his wife became Salvation Army leaders. Catherine spent all her childhood at Hadley Wood, which was &#145;so perfect that I have never written about it, as no-one would believe me&#146;. Her mother disapproved of outside influences acting on the tender minds of her children and taught them all herself for two hours every morning.<br>
<br>At the age of eighteen Catherine Booth left her idyllic family life to become a full-time Salvation Army officer, an occupation she never left until her retirement. She added her father's forename to her surname. Following a period of study at the Salvation Army Training College, her first posting, in 1904, was as a captain in Bath. The pay was 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week and the duties, which started at 6 a.m., meant providing some counter-attraction to the pubs and gin houses every night of the week. She then held appointments in a number of important provincial centres, in charge of the Salvation Army's evangelical work, before commencing, in 1907, a period of ten years assisting with the training of women officers at the army's International Training College in Clapton, London. In 1913 she preached in tsarist Russia and in 1917 made headlines when she led a rescue team into the area devastated by the Silvertown munitions factory explosion in West Ham, London, in which sixty people were killed. Later she was involved with relief work in Europe after both world wars. She vacated her post at the International Training College in 1917 to assume responsibility as international secretary for Salvation Army work in Europe, attached to the international headquarters in London. She was subsequently (1926&#150;46) in charge of the movement's social work among women in Great Britain. In 1927 she was appointed a commissioner, concerned with all the Salvation Army's social welfare activities, meeting the needs of all types of people, from orphaned children to the elderly residents of Salvation Army eventide homes. From 1946 she was international secretary for Europe until she retired in 1948.<br>
<br>Catherine Bramwell-Booth was nominated three times for the generalship of the Salvation Army. On each occasion, in 1934, 1939, and 1946, the election resulted in one of the other candidates assuming the mantle of international leader. Possibly it was felt that the movement, at that stage, should not appear to be dependent on the Booth &#145;dynasty&#146;. Certainly Commissioner Catherine, as she became affectionately known, was firmly in the Booth mould of charismatic leadership. Throughout her life she remained true to the evangelical driving force of her parents and grandparents. Everyone confronted by her, from local tradesmen to distinguished national journalists, could expect a fearless cross-examination of their spiritual state and a presentation of the claims of her beloved Jesus Christ. She was a Salvation Army officer who never strayed from her roots and never lost her pioneering zeal. She had a keen analytical mind and a fund of knowledge which made her public addresses dynamic and inspiring, as well as informative.<br>
<br>Catherine Bramwell-Booth wrote several books, her best being a biography of her grandmother, <span class="italic">Catherine Booth: the Story of her Loves</span> (1970). This book brought her public recognition late in life, which resulted in her becoming something of a media personality, with a chirpy, engaging manner. During the last decade of her life she made frequent appearances as a stimulating guest on many radio and television programmes. In 1971 she was appointed CBE. Six years later, at the age of ninety-three, she received the Guild of Professional Toastmasters best speaker award&#151;to her own amusement, because she was a lifelong teetotaller. In 1983 she was honoured with the Salvation Army's order of the Founder. She died, unmarried, at the age of 104 on 4 October 1987 at her home, North Court, in Finchampstead, Berkshire, where she lived with two of her sisters.<br>
