<span class="headword">Pierce <span class="st"> [Peirse]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1621/2&#150;1691), <span class="occ">dean of Salisbury and religious controversialist</span>, was the son of John Pierce, or Peirse, a woollen draper and mayor of Devizes, Wiltshire. A gifted musician, Pierce was appointed chorister of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1633 and attended the grammar school adjoining the college under the care of William White. Pierce matriculated from Magdalen on 7 December 1638, aged sixteen, his father being described as &#145;plebeius&#146;, and in 1639 he became a demy. He graduated BA on 4 December 1641 and became a fellow of Magdalen in 1643, proceeding MA on 21 June 1644. Pierce appears to have been a convinced Calvinist in his younger years, but at Oxford he rejected these views, possibly under the influence of his friend and colleague Henry Hammond. Hammond encouraged Pierce to take orders in 1646, and he was priested by Bishop Skinner in a clandestine ordination held in Trinity College on 24 August (St Bartholomew's day).<h2>
<a name="Pierceversusthepuritans"></a>Pierce versus the puritans</h2>Pierce became and would remain a staunch royalist throughout his life, and this led to his ejection from his fellowship on 15 May 1648 by the parliamentary visitors. He responded to this by producing a satire upon them, entitled <span class="italic">A third and fourth part of Pegasus, taught by Bankes his ghost to dance in the Doricke moode, 1 July 1648</span> and signed Basilius Philomusus. He further demonstrated both his literary talents and his devotion to the crown in his poem <span class="italic">Caroli tou makaritou palingenesia</span> (1649), in which he likened Charles's sufferings to those of Christ. Like other ejected royalist divines, Pierce managed to find employment with sympathetic aristocrats, and he joined the household of Dorothy, countess of Sunderland, at Althorp House in Northamptonshire as tutor to her only son, Robert Spencer, who would later become secretary of state to James II. As Spencer's tutor, Pierce spent periods during the 1650s travelling with his student through France and Italy. In 1656 the countess presented Pierce to the rectory of Brington in Northamptonshire, which he held until 1676.<br>
<br>The 1650s saw Pierce turn his polemical abilities to use in theological controversy, and alongside his Oxford colleagues Hammond and Peter Heylyn he became one of the most forceful apologists for anti-Calvinist theology and episcopal Anglicanism during the period of its suppression. Pierce's Arminianism sparked controversy in 1654 and led him to publish <span class="italic">A Correct Copy of some Notes Concerning God's Decrees, Especially of Reprobation</span> under the initials &#145;T. P.&#146; in 1655. This work generated hostile responses from theological opponents such as Henry Whitfield, William Barlee, and Henry Hickman, and a pamphlet war led to further editions of Pierce's work being published in 1657 and 1658, with a fourth edition in 1671. Pierce further defined his position in <span class="italic">The sinner impleaded in his own court, wherein are represented the great discouragements from sinning which the sinner receiveth from sin itself</span> (1656; 2nd and 3rd editions with additions, 1670). He progressively became embroiled in skirmishes with a growing number of opponents including Edward Bagshawe and Richard Baxter. Partly this was to do with Pierce's determination to tar all brands of anti-episcopal protestantism as seditious and/or atheistic, thus glossing over the nuances of doctrinal subtlety in the interests of polemic. Baxter, who suffered particularly from Pierce's malicious style, characterized him as &#145;a confident man, that had a notable Stile and Words at Will, and a venomous railing Pen and Tongue against the Puritans and Calvinists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, bk 2, p. 280).<br>
<br>Pierce's loyalty was amply rewarded at the Restoration. He became a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king, as well as receiving royal patronage in the form of a canonry at Canterbury on 9 July 1660 and the prebend of Langford Manor in the diocese of Lincoln on 11 September 1660&#151;he was installed on 25 September by proxy. Pierce could not be restored to his fellowship at Magdalen because he had married his wife, Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1696), after being ejected from Oxford (an infant son died in February 1657), but he was made reader in theology and was created DD through the king's letters on 7 August 1660. From these positions of strength, Pierce heralded the Anglican campaign to restore episcopacy, asserting in 1660 that &#145;Until our bishops receive their right though we are glad to have our King, we may rationally fear we shall not hold him&#146;  (Pierce, <span class="italic">England's Season for Reformation of Life</span>, 14). He appeared on the episcopal side at the Worcester House conference in 1660 and had to be discouraged from raising the polemical temperature at the Savoy conference by more level-headed colleagues. He managed to preach a more cautious sermon at the opening of the restored convocation on 8 May 1661.<h2>
<a name="PierceversusMagdalenCollege"></a>Pierce versus Magdalen College</h2>On 9 November 1661 Pierce was elected president of Magdalen. His candidacy was unpopular and had to be forced through with letters from the king. His presidency was an unhappy period for all connected with the college: he was a poor administrator, and his talent for satire and invective did not serve him well in his new post. The period was marked by a series of disputes and appeals and the situations were nearly always compounded by Pierce's arbitrary methods and his frequent recourse to print and manuscript. The most notorious example was his dispute with the troublesome Dr Henry Yerbury, whom Pierce expelled from the college. The irregularities of the expulsion led to the involvement of the college visitor, the bishop of Winchester, George Morley, who overturned Pierce's judgment. Pierce endeavoured to justify his action in <span class="italic">A True Account of the Proceedings, and of the Grounds of the Proceedings</span> (1663) against Yerbury, who promptly vindicated his own conduct in a manuscript defence. Pierce also assisted another fellow, John Dobson, in producing lampooning vindications of his own conduct. Pierce's indulgence in such activities, when set alongside his discourtesy towards Morley in the course of his campaign, earned him a royal rebuke; he was ordered to desist from publishing anything else on the matter.<br>
<br>Pierce's presidency continued to be characterized by discord and conflict until at last in 1671 he expressed a wish to retire. There seem to have been three motives: first, he wanted to leave on health grounds&#151;Oxford's damps had caused both him and his family health problems; second, he wanted to finish his revision and expansion of Hugh Robinson's <span class="italic">Annalium mundi universalium</span> (or &#145;Universal history&#146;, later published in 1677); and he claimed the third to be his affection for the college  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1671&#150;2</i>, 166&#150;7). The manner of Pierce's departure was no less controversial than any other act of his presidency. Unusually, he wished to nominate his successor, and he obtained a royal mandate for Henry Clerke, a man deeply unpopular among the fellowship. When the fellows demurred, Pierce made his own resignation conditional upon their acceptance of Clerke. Pierce resigned on 4 March 1672 and the fellowship reluctantly accepted Clerke. Ugly rumours circulated that Pierce had taken several thousand pounds from Clerke in order to secure the position for him  (<span class="italic">Letters of Humphrey Prideaux</span>, 137).<br>
<br>In spite of Pierce's problems at Oxford during the 1660s, he continued to make an impact on a wider stage, particularly through his sermons. On 16 June 1662 he had been appointed to the lectureship at Carfax. During 1661 and 1662 he also preached many notable sermons in London. Perhaps the most important of these was <span class="italic">The Primitive Rule of Reformation</span>, delivered to the king at Whitehall on 1 February 1663. The sermon, attacking the Roman Catholic church, ran through eight editions in 1663 alone and was translated into several foreign languages. It provoked book-length responses from the English Catholic writers Hugh Cressy and John Sergeant, igniting a long-running controversy. Pepys heard Pierce preach on 8 April 1663, and described him as having &#145;as much of natural eloquence as most men that I ever heard in my life, mixed with so much learning&#146;  (Pepys, 4.98).<h2>
<a name="PierceversusSethWard"></a>Pierce versus Seth Ward</h2>Pierce returned to prominence in the mid-1670s, probably as a consequence of Charles II's return to ruling through those committed to maintaining the Anglican confessional state. At the king's recommendation, Pierce was admitted and installed as dean of Salisbury on 4 May 1675, a position which included extensive and almost quasi-episcopal powers over extensive peculiar jurisdictions. This set the scene for Pierce's most notorious controversy, with the bishop of Salisbury, Seth Ward. The conflict between the bishop and the dean went further than purely personal animosity. In contrast to Pierce, Ward had profited from interregnum expulsions, taking chairs in Oxford from ejected royalists. His career had only prospered during the Restoration period, and there is no doubt that Pierce resented the disparity in their relative fortunes. Although there was little open hostility between the two men until the 1680s, from 1676 Pierce was already collecting materials to demonstrate that the cathedral was a royal free chapel, that the cathedral was directly under the jurisdiction of the king rather than the bishop.<br>
<br>The dispute blew up in October 1682 over the right to distribute prebends. Ward had used his available patronage to assist relatively unqualified nephews to obtain prebends in the cathedral. Pierce, who had failed to obtain a similar post for his son Robert, allowed his work to be used in an attack on Ward by a similarly disappointed clergyman. Ward received an anonymous paper of four articles insinuating that the bishop had usurped the rights of the king, an explosive charge in the wake of the Restoration crisis of 1678&#150;81. Ward rejected Pierce's claims and in the spring of 1683 an ecclesiastical commission found in favour of Ward. This might have been the end of the matter, but Ward then decided to visit the cathedral, a clear declaration of war on Pierce's authority as dean. Pierce complained to the king and to the archbishop of Canterbury, claiming that only the king could undertake such a visitation, but he was overruled. On 16 October 1683 Ward began an acrimonious visitation which included enquiries as to Pierce's ordination and his offices. For an enraged Pierce, Ward's visitation was a recurrence of the inveterate enmity between old Cromwellians and old royalists. Pierce published <span class="italic">A Vindication of the King's Sovereign Right</span> in 1683 anonymously, owning up to his authorship in August 1684 and thus perpetuating the conflict.<br>
<br>For Pierce, James II's accession in 1685 seemed to offer a golden opportunity to reassert his ultra-royalist claims against Ward and he lost no time in composing a loyal address of welcome to a monarch whom he felt would be sympathetic to his local cause. Unfortunately for Pierce, he had miscalculated: James noticed Pierce's subversion of ecclesiastical order rather than his royalism, and in May 1685 the king referred the matter to an unsympathetic Archbishop Sancroft. Pierce's address was investigated by the attorney-general, who produced a hostile report, and Sancroft engineered a metropolitan visitation which took place in July 1686 to draw a line under the matter. The process vindicated Ward's right to visit the cathedral every three years and the dean was forced to apologize to the bishop. The protracted struggle left the cathedral in a state of near anarchy and accelerated Ward's descent into senility. The dean's &#145;black and dismal malice&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 4.251) is often blamed for this turn of events but it seems unfair to attribute all of the blame to Pierce alone. Pierce seems to have had a genuine concern for the welfare of what he saw as his cathedral, as evidenced in his plans to restore the building and his generous donations and bequests to the church.<br>
<br>Pierce died on 28 March 1691 in his house on his patrimonial estate at North Tidworth, a few miles north of Amesbury in Wiltshire. He was buried in the churchyard at Tidworth. Instead of the customary rings or gloves, each mourner received his volume <span class="italic">Death Considr'd as a Door to a Life of Glory, Penn'd for the Comfort of Serious Mourners</span> (1690).<br>
