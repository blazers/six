<span class="headword">Mitchell,  Peter Dennis</span>  (1920&#150;1992), <span class="occ">biochemist</span>, was born on 29 September 1920 at 19 Rustic Avenue, Mitcham, Surrey, the younger son of Christopher Gibbs Mitchell (1889&#150;1951), civil servant, and his wife, Kate Beatrice Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taplin (1892&#150;1974), daughter of William George Taplin of Peckham and his wife, Rosetta. His father was the elder son of Christopher Mitchell, a stonemason and quarry owner who had moved to London towards the end of the nineteenth century, going into partnership in a business importing stone to London. His father's brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31446/', "Sir Godfrey Way Mitchell")</script>, went into his father's business, but after the First World War he acquired and built up the firm of George Wimpey and was chairman from 1930 to 1973. Wimpey shares were passed to the family and Mitchell became one of the beneficiaries, particularly through his mother and his elder brother. His father was a successful civil servant and was made OBE. His mother, who probably had the greater influence on him, was a shy, gentle person, of very independent thought and action, with a strong artistic perceptiveness. Being a rationalist and an atheist, she taught him that he had to accept responsibility for his own destiny and especially for his failings in life.<br>
<br>Mitchell went initially to Streatham grammar school and transferred to Barrow Hedges School after the family moved to Carshalton, Surrey, in 1927. In 1931 he entered Queen's College, Taunton, a school with a Methodist foundation, though from the age of about fifteen he adopted an atheistic philosophy. He failed the Cambridge scholarship exam in 1939, but went to Jesus College on the recommendation of his headmaster at Taunton, C. L. Wiseman, an able mathematician who influenced Mitchell significantly. At Cambridge, Mitchell followed courses for the natural sciences tripos, studying physics, chemistry, physiology, mathematics, and biochemistry in part one (in which he obtained a second class), and specializing in biochemistry for part two (in which he obtained an upper second). After graduating in 1942, he continued in Cambridge, undertaking research with Jim Danielli as his supervisor while also working on aspects of British anti-Lewisite as part of the war effort. Danielli introduced him to David Keilin, the scientist whom he came to love and respect more than any other. It was during this time that he met Jennifer Moyle, also working in the biochemistry department at Cambridge. Moyle worked with Mitchell from about 1948 until her retirement in 1983. Mitchell's thesis for the PhD degree was referred because it was too speculative, Mitchell having incorporated many philosophical elements. The final thesis, on the action of penicillin, was accepted in December 1950. Meanwhile, on 11 December 1944, Mitchell married Eileen Margaret Forbes Rollo (<i>b</i>. 1917/18), a nurse, and daughter of William Forbes Rollo, a civil servant; they had twins, Jeremy and Julia. However, the marriage was not successful and they parted some years later.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Mitchell worked on aspects of the properties of bacterial membranes, especially the transport of phosphate. In 1955 he was persuaded by Michael Swann, then professor of zoology at Edinburgh, to leave Cambridge in order to set up a new chemical biology unit in the zoology department at Edinburgh, where he would be a lecturer (later senior lecturer and ultimately reader) and director of the new unit. Moyle also transferred to Edinburgh and their collaboration continued. Mitchell bought the Old Manse at Carrington, south of Edinburgh, and renovated it for use as his home. His most significant intellectual development during this period was the formulation of ideas about vectorial metabolism. In essence this considered the directional aspect of the chemical processes taking place in cells. With membrane-bound enzymes, it implied that a reaction could be catalysed where the reactants came from one side of the membrane but the products were released on the other, thus bringing about both the reaction and the transfer of a substance across the membrane. Initially Mitchell applied his ideas to reactions such as those in which a phosphate group is added to or removed from a sugar. Mitchell himself considered this theoretical aspect of his work as his most fundamental and important contribution to biology, though he is remembered more for its specific application in the chemiosmotic theory where he considered the addition of a phosphate to the adenine nucleotide ADP, to form ATP as a vectorial process.<br>
<br>The means by which energy is drawn from oxidation of substances in cells and converted to the energy currency, ATP, is known as oxidative phosphorylation. Mitchell proposed his chemiosmotic theory in 1961 and revised it five years later to its final form. He suggested that the respiratory chain, the enzyme system which reduces oxygen to water in all aerobic cells, pumps protons across the membrane, creating both a gradient of protons from one side to the other and an electrical potential. The protons return across the membrane, encouraged by the potential via any route available. The major route is through the ATPase or ATP synthase enzyme driving the addition of a phosphate to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Thus energy from oxidation is initially stored as a proton gradient and membrane potential, which is then used for ATP synthesis. These proposals were not easily accepted by the scientific community. Workers in the field of oxidative phosphorylation were almost all trained chemists and believed that energy from oxidation must initially be stored in a chemical substance, the search for which had occupied many workers for a long period without success. Moreover, Mitchell's proposals appeared with arguments sufficient enough to make them plausible but without any experimental evidence in their support. It was therefore some years before the theory was accepted.<br>
<br>On 1 November 1958 Mitchell married (Patricia) Helen Mary (<i>b</i>. 1924), formerly Robertson. An artist whom he had originally met in Cambridge, she was the daughter of Colonel Raymont Patrick Thomas ffrench, formerly of the Indian army. They brought up two more boys, Jason and Gideon, and enjoyed more than thirty years of a close and happy marriage.<br>
<br>During the early 1960s Mitchell's health deteriorated and he suffered from stomach ulcers. On medical advice he resigned his readership in 1963 and moved to a cottage outside Bodmin in Cornwall. He had earlier been attracted by a dilapidated, Regency-fronted mansion at Glynn, to the south-east of Bodmin, which he bought and with the co-operation of Moyle restored to form a research institute together with a home for his family and flats. The new Glynn Research Institute, which opened for research work in 1965, possessed laboratories, preparation rooms, a library, and ancillary facilities. It was initially staffed by Mitchell, Moyle, and as technician Roy Mitchell (no relation to Peter), together with the company secretary. Research was directed at testing the validity of the chemiosmotic theory. The isolation of Glynn gave Mitchell an ideal environment for his work, and it was compensated by his ability to discuss ideas prodigiously by letter.<br>
<br>In 1966 Mitchell published the first <span class="roman">Grey Book</span> from Glynn, a revised and much fuller version of the theory proposed in the 1961 paper in <span class="italic">Nature</span>. It was the <span class="roman">Grey Book</span> rather than other publications such as a major review in <span class="italic">Biological Reviews</span> (also in 1966) which enabled scientists around the world to begin to understand Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory. The theory itself, however, was still not acceptable to large numbers of workers in the field, a situation which persisted until the mid-1970s. Although the first clear support for the theory came from an American group led by Andre Jagendorf, working on chloroplast photosynthesis, research at Glynn revealed evidence for the theory, the first demonstration that protons were pumped by the respiratory chain being published in 1965. The Glynn group also provided evidence for the involvement of protons in ATP synthesis in the same year.<br>
<br>The question of <i>how</i> the respiratory chain pumped protons across the membrane occupied Mitchell from the outset. The 1966 <span class="roman">Grey Book</span> and its sequel, the second <span class="roman">Grey Book</span> (published in 1968), considered possible mechanisms for linking the process of oxidation-reduction to proton pumping based on the idea of the redox loop. In 1975 Mitchell put forward the &#145;Q-cycle&#146;, a version of his redox loop principle, as a mechanism for the transport of protons by the second of the three energy-conserving complexes of the respiratory chain. This provided not only a much needed, plausible mechanism for proton pumping but also explained hitherto puzzling experimental results obtained with the middle (second) complex of the respiratory chain; it also demonstrated how a single electron passing through the complex might pump two protons across the membrane. Initially the cycle was received with some scepticism, but progressively over the next ten to fifteen years sound evidence was accumulated in its support.<br>
<br>As the 1970s progressed, despite its unorthodox character the correctness of the basic postulates of the chemiosmotic theory was increasingly recognized. In 1974 Mitchell was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1981 he was awarded the society's Copley medal. In 1978 the Nobel committee decided to award Mitchell the prize for chemistry for his work in the field of bioenergetics and particularly the chemiosmotic theory. The ultimate acceptance of his initial proposals convinced Mitchell of the validity of his approach to oxidative phosphorylation. From the outset he had ascribed to the final complex of the respiratory chain, the cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase, only an electron-transporting function, since this complex possessed nothing which Mitchell could identify as a proton carrier. This situation led to a major conflict with a Finnish biochemist, M. Wikstr&ouml;m (and an increasing number of other biochemists worldwide), between 1977 and 1985, which concluded with Mitchell's acceptance of the argument that the oxidase pumped protons. This argument was one of several in which Mitchell engaged, including those on the total number of protons pumped by the respiratory chain, and the mechanism by which protons would drive the synthesis of ATP by the ATPase. Although in many (though not all) of these disputes on detailed aspects of the chemiosmotic theory he ultimately accepted the opposing viewpoint, he maintained his position and the respect of the opposition by virtue of the skill which he used to suggest valid alternative interpretations of the experimental results, thus undermining his opponents' positions. In his later years Mitchell was forced to give increasing amounts of time to fund-raising for the Glynn Research Institute, whose original endowment could no longer support all of its needs. In order to give more time to these activities and to provide a base for the future research of the institute, a new research director, Peter Rich, was appointed.<br>
<br>Mitchell remained an active scientist until his death. In the course of his career he published some 200 scientific papers and essays. His major contribution to biological science was to provide a new framework for bioenergetics, in which the process of energy conservation in oxidation was firmly linked to the transport of molecules across cell membranes. While physiologists developed an understanding of transport processes and while biochemists established the chemical reactions in metabolism, the failure of the two groups to interact inhibited the solution of major biological problems. Mitchell's achievement was to bring transport and metabolism together, providing a single unified conceptual framework, thus benefiting both fields.<br>
<br>Mitchell had considerable charm, which enabled him to communicate his ideas to others and which was also a necessary compensation for an aggressive tendency in argument. He was distinguished in appearance, with dark, wavy, receding hair worn down to his shoulders over much of his life. He also sported a gold earring in his left ear, imitating one of his sons. He had other serious interests. Philosophy, on which he published some essays, had fascinated him since his undergraduate years or earlier, though it was not a subject on which he received tuition at Cambridge. The philosophical system which he developed as the basis for the first rejected thesis was fully consistent with his theoretical approach to biology, and it no doubt influenced the development of most of his theoretical ideas. If Keilin had been the scientist he most admired, then Karl Popper was his other hero. Popper's philosophy greatly interested him.<br>
<br>Partly out of his concerns over inflation (which always threatened the financial security of the institute) Mitchell also became keenly interested in economics. For many years he was a member of a private think-tank, the Economic Research Council. Arising from the many controversies in which he had been engaged, Mitchell was concerned about the process of human communication, and occasionally wrote on this subject. At various times he considered redirecting the work of the Glynn Institute either towards economics or towards the study of human communication. However, friends persuaded him that his greatest contribution would be in the biological sciences, the area which retains his imprint. He died of cancer at Glynn House on 10 April 1992. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
