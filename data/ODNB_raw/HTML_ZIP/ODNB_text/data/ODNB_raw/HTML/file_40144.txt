<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cotton,  (Thomas) Henry</span>  (1907&#150;1987), <span class="occ">golfer</span>, was born on 28 January 1907 at The Croft, Church Hulme, Congleton, Cheshire, the second son in the family of two sons and one daughter of George Cotton, an industrialist, inventor, and Wesleyan lay preacher, and his second wife, Alice le Poidevin, a native of Guernsey. His early childhood was spent in Peckham. He and his brother, Leslie, went to Ivydale Road school, Peckham, and, after their evacuation from London in the First World War, to Reigate grammar school. From there Cotton won a scholarship to Alleyn's School, Dulwich. The war over, George Cotton obtained junior membership for both boys at the Aquarius Golf Club, and both won the club championship before reaching their teens. From the time he left Alleyn's (after irritating the headmaster) to become a golf professional at sixteen, Cotton trod a path of his own. His aloofness lost him popularity with contemporaries, and his strong will brought him into conflict with golf's rulers, but he rarely deviated from his chosen course. His achievements were founded on intense application and self-reliance.<br>
<br>When Cotton entered his profession, the status of golf professional was barely above that of a senior caddy. By personal example Cotton did more than anyone of his time to alter that. He sought the best: silk shirts from Jermyn Street, limousines rather than taxis, and the best restaurants. Though he won three British open championships and many famous victories, his impact on his own profession was his greatest attainment. He was not long content to be the junior of six assistants at Fulwell Golf Club on 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a week. Within a year he had moved to an assistant's post at Rye. There he made friends with Cyril Tolley, a fine amateur golfer, who assisted his next move. At nineteen, Cotton went to Langley Park, the youngest head professional in the history of British golf.<br>
<br>At this point Cotton perceived that to reach the top in golf he must challenge American supremacy. With the blessing of his club, &pound;300, and a first-class ticket on the <i>Aquitania</i>, he joined the 1928&#150;9 winter season in America. A year later he was invited to Argentina to teach and play exhibition matches with a fellow professional. There (Maria) Isabel Estanguet Moss (1902&#150;1982) booked him for fifty lessons. The daughter of Pedro Estanguet, a wealthy landowner, and his wife, Epifania, and married to Enrique Moss, of Argentina's diplomatic service, Toots, as she became universally called, was five years older than Cotton. They formed a close partnership, which transformed both their lives. Eventually, on the annulment in Latvia in June 1939 of her first marriage, they married at a Westminster register office on 11 December 1939. They had no children, though there were two daughters from Isabel's first marriage. Passionately loyal to Cotton's interests, she became, when occasion demanded, his most trenchant critic, as well as a competent golfer herself.<br>
<br>Cotton won three open victories (1934 at Royal St George's, 1937 at Carnoustie, and 1948 at Muirfield). After seven years at Langley Park, he had taken a post at Waterloo, a fashionable club near Brussels. But after his first open win, he was persuaded by the sixth earl of Rosebery to build up the reputation of Ashridge Golf Club. The outbreak of the Second World War interrupted a career at the peak of success. Cotton joined the Royal Air Force, and suffered a regime which aggravated his stomach ulcer. After being medically discharged with the rank of flight lieutenant, he raised &pound;70,000 for the Red Cross and other war charities from 130 matches which he organized. He took appointments first at Coombe Hill and then at Royal Mid-Surrey. From there he won his last open in 1948. That was the apogee of a career in which he had dominated tournament golf for some twenty years. He was also captain of the British Ryder cup team in 1947 and 1953. Though he had minor wins in 1953 and 1954, writing, teaching, and golf architecture became the main outlets for his energies. He wrote several books on golf, as well as designing thirteen golf courses in Britain and ten more abroad.<br>
<br>In 1963 Cotton went to Portugal, and on the Algarve coast created from a swamp the Penina golf course. This became his memorial, and he became virtually squire of the place until the Portuguese revolution of April 1974, during which he was expelled. Profoundly depressed by enforced exile, Cotton was rallied by his wife and they moved for a spell to Sotogrande in Spain. After a two-year interlude they returned to Portugal. There, at Christmas 1982, Toots died, ending half a century's close partnership. In 1987 Cotton entered King Edward VII Hospital, and was there told of his knighthood. He had been appointed MBE in 1946. During his convalescence he died suddenly from a heart attack at Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, Westminster, on 22 December 1987; he was buried at Mexilhoeira Grande in Portugal. He was knighted posthumously in the new year's honours of 1988.<br>
<br>Always an individualist, Cotton taught that golfing excellence demanded infinite pains. He believed in strong hands and could hit a succession of one-handed shots without regripping the club. A severe opponent, he was also an excellent host. Tireless in pursuit of his own goals, he freely shared with a generation of young golfers more insight into the game than any other figure of his time.<br>
