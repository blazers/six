<span class="headword">Charles,  James Henry</span>  (1851&#150;1906), <span class="occ">landscape and genre painter</span>, was born at Warrington, Lancashire, on 5 January 1851. His ancestors, who were French, settled originally at Caernarfon and owned fishing and cargo boats which traded with Anglesey. His father, Richard Charles (1823&#150;1893), was a draughtsman and cabinet-maker who designed the mayor of Caernarfon's chair of office and his mother, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davis, was the daughter of a butcher. Charles accompanied his father to London in 1865, and worked for a time in his father's office and in a lithographer's before registering at Heatherley's School of Art, Chelsea. From there he moved to the Royal Academy Schools in 1872, first exhibiting at the academy with <span class="italic">An Italian Youth in Armour</span> in 1875. Earlier, on 25 January of that same year, he had married Ellen Agnes (1854/5&#150;1909), a milliner, the daughter of William Williams, a dyer. They settled at 15 Halsey Street, Chelsea, and had five sons and seven daughters.<br>
<br>Initially Charles attempted a career as a portrait painter, exhibiting portraits of his father and Victor Cavendish, later ninth duke of Devonshire, in 1876 and 1877 respectively. An important connection was made in 1879 when Charles met John Maddocks, the Bradford mill owner who amassed a large collection of his work and encouraged him to develop a type of rural genre of which <span class="italic">The Knifegrinder</span> (1877; Manchester City Galleries) and <span class="italic">Grandad, She Doesn't Want to Go to School</span> (1883; Warrington Museum and Art Gallery) are typical. During the 1880s Charles established close friendships with the members of the New English Art Club, especially with George Clausen and Henry Herbert La Thangue. He exhibited <span class="italic">Dignity in Distress</span> at its inaugural exhibition in 1886. Although influenced in general terms by the rustic naturalist painter Jules Bastien-Lepage, Charles did not adopt the mannerisms generally associated with his followers. He was nevertheless committed to producing large subject pictures such as <span class="italic">Christening Sunday</span> (1887; Manchester City Galleries).<br>
<br>During the 1880s Charles worked at Thorpacre near Loughborough and South Harting, Petersfield, Sussex, before moving in 1889 to Colnor House, Bosham, Chichester. In this year he won a silver medal at the Universal Exhibition for <span class="italic">The Baptism</span>. In 1892 he worked in Venice and painted pictures such as <span class="italic">The Heat of the Day, Venice</span> (Warrington Museum and Art Gallery). Throughout the early 1890s Charles continued to produce large and impressive academy pieces, one of the last of which, <span class="italic">Signing the Marriage Register</span> (1895; Cartwright Hall, Bradford Museums and Art Galleries), portrays the interior of the church at Bosham, with his wife, Ellen, and two daughters, Nina and Marion, used as models. By this time Charles was producing smaller, more saleable impressionistic landscape studies, often painted directly from the motif, which owe more to Adolphe Monticelli than to Monet or Pissarro. A number of these were purchased by Sir Hugh Lane and later presented to public collections in Dublin and Belfast. During the summers of 1902 and 1904 Charles worked at Montreuil-sur-Mer in northern France producing seascapes and coastal genre pictures. Sadly on a visit to the eisteddfod at Caernarfon in August 1906, where he was to act as a judge, Charles fell ill with appendicitis, underwent an operation, and died on 27 August as a result; he was buried in Fulham cemetery. Tributes immediately flooded in and a memorial exhibition was held at the Leicester Galleries, London, in 1907. For the catalogue of this show George Clausen wrote an admiring introduction in which he referred to Charles's fine sense of colour and his eye for &#145;the harmony and envelopment of a scene&#146;. At the same time T. Martin Wood published an article on Charles in <span class="italic">The Studio</span> praising his &#145;naturalness&#146; and the &#145;sunlit charm&#146; of his art  (Wood, 98).<br>
