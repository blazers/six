His father was executed for high treason on 2 June 1537 for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace. Lumley inherited the family estates around Durham on the death of his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17178/', "John Lumley, fifth Baron Lumley (b. in or before 1492, d. 1545)")</script>, by virtue of a settlement made after his father's attainder. He inherited extensive estates and was the greatest coal owner among the English aristocracy, obtaining a charter of incorporation for Hartlepool, co. Durham, on 3 February 1593 in order to erect a pier for shipping coal to the south. More important, he was also a committed Catholic. On his petition to parliament in 1547 he was restored in blood and created Baron Lumley.<h2>
<a name="Lifeandpoliticalcareer"></a>Life and political career</h2>Lumley's destiny was determined by his marriage, in or before 1550, to Jane (1537&#150;1577) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47846/', "Lumley, Jane")</script>], translator, eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9530/', "Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel (1512&#150;1580)")</script>, and his first wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1542), daughter of Thomas Grey, second marquess of Dorset. Lumley met her brother, Henry Fitzalan, Baron Maltravers (1538&#150;1556), at Cambridge, where they matriculated as fellow-commoners at Queens' College in May 1549. Lumley's manuscript translation of Erasmus, <span class="italic">Institution of a Christian Prince</span> (BL, Royal MS 17 A.xlix) is inscribed to Arundel at the end, &#145;your lordshippes obedient sone, J. Lumley 1550&#146;, suggesting that he was married by that date. The couple had two sons and a daughter, none of whom survived to adulthood. Lumley was created KB on 29 September 1553 and attended Mary I's coronation on 1 October.<br>
<br>The death of Arundel's second wife, Mary, in October 1557 and the deaths of Lady Lumley's siblings during these years increased Lumley's importance; Arundel began to look on him as a son. The Lumleys may have spent the first years of their married life at Lumley's London house in Hart Street near Tower Hill (a house built for the poet Sir Thomas Wyatt) and at Lumley Castle, near Chester-le-Street, co. Durham. However, Arundel's various bereavements led them to move to his new residence, Nonsuch Palace, Surrey. Lumley was keeper of the great park of Nonsuch from 20 August 1559 until his death, a position which carried an annual fee of &pound;4 8<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Both Arundel and he made various alterations to Nonsuch, the most important of which was the creation of extensive gardens.<br>
<br>Lumley became high steward of the University of Oxford on 24 February 1559 on the elevation of Arundel to chancellor. He maintained a relationship with the university throughout his life, donating forty books to the Bodleian Library in 1599. He also gave eighty-seven duplicate books from his own library to the University of Cambridge Library in 1598.<br>
<br>A steady adherent of Arundel's, Lumley was deeply implicated in the Ridolfi Plot of 1571 for the re-establishment of Roman Catholicism and in the marriage negotiations of his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13941/', "Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk (1538&#150;1572)")</script>, to Mary, queen of Scots. His involvement in these intrigues, which went on for a number of years and included telling Guerau de Spes, the Spanish ambassador, in August 1569 that he could raise men, led to incarceration in the Tower of London after September 1571. He was then held at several other locations until released in April 1573. These activities ended any political ambitions he had. It seems likely that Lumley erected the grove of Diana, England's first allegorical garden (an area of inscriptions, sculptures, and tableaux away from the formal privy garden) at Nonsuch as an apology for his involvement in the Ridolfi Plot.<br>
<br>Despite his long imprisonment on Mary's account, Lumley avoided association with the subsequent plots for her escape and accepted nomination as one of the commissioners for her trial. He was present at Fotheringhay Castle, Northamptonshire, and in the court of Star Chamber in October 1586. He sat in judgment on a number of important trials, including those of Henry Grey, duke of Suffolk, in 1554, Dr Rowland Taylor in 1557, and William Davison in 1587. He was also appointed commissioner for settling claims for the coronations of both Elizabeth I (whom he attended on her journey from Hatfield to London at her accession in November 1558) and James I, and for the creation of the knights of the Bath in 1603.<br>
<br>Arundel died at Arundel House, Westminster, on 24 February 1580 and Nonsuch passed to Lumley, along with his father-in-law's huge arrears in debt. The greatest single amount owed was the so-called &#145;Florentine debt&#146;. This was a loan of &pound;11,000 owed to Henry VIII by a group of Florentine merchants. Arundel and Lumley were given responsibility in 1564 for repaying the money, now owed to Elizabeth; they hoped to make money on the deal but were unable to fulfil their promise. Lumley began to negotiate terms for the payment of the debt in 1590 and in 1592 it was agreed that he would give Nonsuch to the queen but remain resident as keeper. He was allowed a lease on the great park and was excused from paying after a few years. Lumley was also the owner of a number of properties in and around Chichester (because of its proximity to his wife's family base at Arundel) and exercised patronage over its parliamentary seat. He sponsored Anthony Watson, rector of Cheam, Surrey, who became bishop of Chichester in 1596, and wrote the most important description of Nonsuch and its gardens. Lumley also had a house at Stanstead, Sussex (which had been the property of his first wife), where it is said that Henry, prince of Wales, visited him in September 1603.<br>
<br>By the time of Lumley's second marriage, in 1582, to Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1617), daughter of John Darcy, second Baron Darcy of Chiche, and his wife, Frances, he was no longer a significant figure at court; he seems to have spent more time at Lumley Castle, where he gradually expressed his interest in ancestry and genealogy through a series of decorative embellishments. There were no children of his second marriage. It is said that James I visited Lumley Castle on his journey south to London in 1603 but, Lumley being absent, he was shown around by Tobie Matthew, bishop of Durham, who lectured him on the baron's long and noble pedigree. The king is supposed to have become bored by this lengthy diatribe and stopped the bishop, saying &#145;oh, mon, gang na futher. I maun digest the knowledge I ha' this day gained, for I didna' ken Adam's ither nam was Lumley&#146;  (Milner, 92).<h2>
<a name="Collectionsandpatronage"></a>Collections and patronage</h2>Lumley was one of the great Elizabethan collector-patrons. His collections, which included books, paintings, and marbles, were catalogued during his lifetime and transcriptions of the manuscripts published during the twentieth century. The significance of these inventories cannot be underestimated&#151;they provide a unique illustration of his particular interests and intellectual pursuits as well as a more general picture of aristocratic taste in Elizabethan England. Unfortunately there is no trace of the gardens at Nonsuch, but this complex project was Lumley's other significant contribution to Elizabethan culture.<br>
<br>Lumley's library was one of the largest in Elizabethan England. It was housed at Nonsuch and contained nearly 3000 books. Remarkably, the majority of the books listed in the catalogue survive in the British Library as they passed from Lumley to Henry, prince of Wales (exactly how this happened is not known), and thence into the Royal Library. The books are inscribed with the original purchaser's name. Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, Arundel, and Lumley's brother-in-law, the Welsh antiquary Humphrey Lloyd (<i>c</i>.1527&#150;1568), all contributed significant numbers of books. However, the vast majority were collected by Lumley himself.<br>
<br>The catalogue is divided by subject and size and is remarkable for the wide range of titles it contains, but the predominance of scientific, medical, and geographical titles should be noted. Lumley's interest in medicine led to his sponsorship of a regular surgery lecture at the Royal College of Physicians between 1582 and 1583. The other significant group of titles, although small in number, is listed at the end under the heading <span class="italic">Musici</span>. These include religious works by the Catholic composer William Byrd, one of which is dedicated to Lumley, as well as one of the earliest sets of madrigals to be seen in England. This was commissioned by Arundel while in Italy in 1566 and 1567 and sent to him by the composer Innocenzo Alberti.<br>
<br>Lumley's collection of paintings, furniture, and stone sculptures is included in the famous illustrated inventory, known as the <span class="roman">Red Velvet Book</span> (because of a later binding), which remains in the possession of Lumley's descendant the earl of Scarbrough. The inventory includes the contents of all of Lumley's residences and was drawn up in 1590 during his financial negotiations with Elizabeth (presumably in order to establish exactly which of the contents were Lumley's). Unfortunately this inventory does not list the continu by location, but another, of Lumley Castle, dated 1609, helps to establish the locations of at least some of the items in 1590.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Red Velvet Book</span> starts with a written account of Lumley Castle, followed by transcripts of various historic deeds and detailed heraldic descriptions. The inventory proper begins with a series of hand-coloured illustrations of sculptures, fountains, and furniture. Notable among the statuary are the free-standing fountains and obelisks, which were situated in the privy garden at Nonsuch. These are remarkable for their classical form and can be related to continental examples. It is possible that Lumley may have known of them through engravings or drawings or perhaps the accounts of Arundel and Lloyd after their journey to Italy. Many of the other objects illustrated were to be found at Lumley Castle, as they can be identified through the description of the castle at the start of the <span class="roman">Red Velvet Book</span>, including marble busts of Henry VIII and his children (presently at Leeds Castle, Kent). Sadly, none of the furniture illustrated in the inventory survives.<br>
<br>The inventory continues with a list of paintings. These are described in more detail than almost any other contemporary inventory, often including the artist's name, and it has been possible to identify the hand of at least one artist using evidence from this inventory. As with Lumley's books, it is still possible to identify some of his paintings as each was painted with the so-called &#145;Lumley cartellino&#146;&#151;a fictive scrap of paper with the sitter's name written on it. The predominance of portraits in the collection has often been noted, and it has been assumed that Lumley's interests lay more with the sitters than the artists. However, the list includes a number of other genres, such as still lifes and religious works.<br>
<br>The grove of Diana at Nonsuch is known only through written accounts, the most detailed (and most florid) being the Latin description written by Watson before 1592. The grove was constructed in order to lead the visitor past a series of sculptures, fountains, and buildings which conveyed a complex allegorical message. This type of garden, using all of the senses and many media, was developed in northern Italy during the late first half of the sixteenth century, particularly at the Medici villas outside Florence. Lumley's inspiration must have come through written and verbal descriptions of these gardens, as the grove of Diana was unlike anything else built in England at the time. It portrayed Elizabeth as Diana, while Lumley is both characterized as Acteon and as the apologetic &#145;smitten fisher&#146;.<br>
<br>Lumley's concern with family ancestry and genealogy was remarkable and it is not surprising that he is often incorrectly described as being a member of the Society of Antiquaries. It is still possible to appreciate this aspect of his personality through an examination of the various tombs (all surviving) that he erected, as well as through his books and building projects. These interests may also reflect his concern to portray himself as a member of the ancient nobility. The first group of tombs, for himself, his wives, and children, is to be found in the Lumley chapel at St Dunstan's, Cheam. They are all illustrated in the <span class="roman">Red Velvet Book</span>. Lumley's own tomb concentrates on genealogy, while that for Jane Lumley is remarkably classical in its decoration and detail. Between 1594 and 1597 he also arranged for the installation of a group of tombs at the church of St Mary and St Cuthbert in Chester-le-Street. These fourteen tombs to his ancestors included real monuments removed from Durham Cathedral, as well as fictive examples that Lumley had made in an appropriately medieval style. In 1596 he erected a tomb to the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth earls of Arundel in the Fitzalan chapel at Arundel Castle. This was deliberately evocative of a medieval chantry chapel, such as that to William Fitzalan, ninth earl of Arundel, opposite, and is yet another example of Lumley's historicizing attitude.<br>
<br>Certain of Lumley's building projects were intentionally historicizing, particularly his alterations to Lumley Castle of the 1580s, which included the addition of rows of heraldic shields in the main courtyard and the erection of the &#145;Lumley horseman&#146; (now at Leeds Castle) in the hall. This polychrome wooden equestrian monument (illustrated in the <span class="roman">Red Velvet Book</span>) represents Edward III in whose time the castle was founded. It relates to the similar monuments and paintings commissioned by various Italian city states (particularly Venice) in honour of foreign warriors, especially the <i>condottieri</i>, like Sir John Hawkwood, and it is possible that Lumley was told of these statues by Arundel and Lloyd on their return from Italy. It was the first statue of its kind to be made in England.<br>
<br>The greatest myth about Lumley is that he travelled to Italy and that this provided him with the inspiration for his collecting and building projects, especially the grove of Diana. Although it is absolutely clear from the documentation that Lumley did not go to Italy, it is easy to understand why historians have made this assumption. Modern research into patterns of patronage and manufacture in Elizabethan England (especially the availability of printed sources and the activities of northern artists and craftsmen) helps to explain how Lumley could have built and collected as he did without leaving England.<h2>
<a name="Deathandburial"></a>Death and burial</h2>Lumley died on 11 April 1609 at his residence in London and was buried at night (presumably with Catholic ritual) in the Lumley chapel at St Dunstan's, Cheam. In 1607 he had entailed the lands and castle of Lumley on <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17181/', "Richard Lumley, first Viscount Lumley of Waterford (bap. 1589, d. 1661x3)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66528/', "Lumley, Elizabeth, Viscountess Lumley of Waterford (c.1578&#150;1658)")</script>]. From him descended the earls of Scarbrough.<br>
