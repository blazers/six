</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kossoff,  David</span>  (1919&#150;2005), <span class="occ">actor and broadcaster</span>, was born on 24 November 1919, at the Mothers' Hospital, Clapton, London, the son of Lewis (Louis) Kossoff, tailor, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shaklovich. At the time of his birth registration his parents, Russian Jewish immigrants, lived at 104 Amhurst Road, Hackney. He was educated at an elementary school in east London and the Northern Polytechnic, London, which he left in 1937. The poverty of his parents, and those he saw around him, made him determined to do something better with his life. He spent a year as a draughtsman, took up interior design, especially of furniture, and was working on aircraft design when he told his appalled parents that he wanted to become an actor, reasoning that this was a good way of meeting attractive women. Years later he joked that his parents were so disturbed about the insecurity of an actor's life that they must have been the only parents of a son of call-up age in Britain who were relieved when the Second World War broke out. In the event he spent the war as a technical illustrator. On 3 October 1940, at Hackney register office, he married Elizabeth Kennedy, a 22-year-old member of the Women's Auxiliary Fire Service, and daughter of Richard McLeod Kennedy, civil engineer.<br>
<br>Kossoff made his d&eacute;but as an actor in 1943; he had joined the left-wing Unity Theatre at the end of the previous year, and at twenty-three played the part of Juan Rojo in <span class="italic">The Spanish Village</span>, a play about the Spanish Civil War. He remained with the Unity Theatre for three years, directing as well as acting in plays that were specially selected to entertain people who had had to spend night after night in air-raid shelters. When the war ended in 1945 he joined the BBC Drama Repertory Company, staying with it for six years. During this time he combined his radio acting with illustrating and designing. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 25 September 1947 he married Marjorie Eileen (otherwise Margaret or Jennie) Hunt, the thirty-year-old daughter of Francis Jenkins, scientific instrument maker, and former wife of John Hunt. They had two sons.<br>
<br>It was his first major West End success, in Peter Ustinov's sometimes surreal play <span class="italic">The Love of Four Colonels</span>, that convinced Kossoff that he could become a full-time actor. At Wyndham's theatre in 1952 he took over the part of the Russian colonel, Alexander Ikonenko, one of four colonels representing the four victorious post-war powers in Berlin&#151;the Russians, the Americans, the British, and the French. Despite his youth Kossoff gave a convincing and much praised performance of a Russian of narrow materialist vision who is incredulous and alarmed when things occur that do not follow his logic. He later again played a Russian&#151;a KGB spy&#151;in the film <span class="italic">The Iron Petticoat</span> (1956), starring Katharine Hepburn and Bob Hope. But although it was in 1953 that he made his film d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">The Good Beginning</span>, it was in Wolf Mankowitz's <span class="italic">The Bespoke Overcoat</span> at the Arts Theatre in 1953 (as in Jack Clayton's 1956 film version), in which he played the sympathetic and philosophizing tailor Morry, and <span class="italic">A Kid for Two Farthings</span> (1955), in which he played the same sort of role and gained a British Academy award, that he established his reputation as a &#145;natural&#146; for playing Jewish men, often elderly and certainly philosophical, benevolent, and sympathetic. In <span class="italic">A Kid for Two Farthings</span> he was the elderly confidant of a boy who believes that his goat with only one remaining horn is really a unicorn.<br>
<br>In the late 1950s Kossoff was best known for playing the vulgar but endearing old scalliwag Alf Larkin in the television series <span class="italic">The Larkins</span> (1958&#150;60 and 1963&#150;4), based on the novels of H. E. Bates. To those who suggested that Alf the amiable oaf did not fully extend Kossoff's powers, the latter was apt to reply, as he did to one journalist:<blockquote>Alf earns ten times as much as Kossoff, mate. He helps Kossoff choose the parts he wants in straight plays and to say &#145;No&#146; to the others. I like Alf. A lot of hard work went into creating him. He's probably the best thing I've ever done. (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 24 March 2005)</blockquote>The fact that his Alf was to record cockney songs on several records and star in a film spin-off, <span class="italic">Inn for Trouble</span> (1960), added to his satisfaction.<br>
<br>In 1961 Kossoff started reading his own idiosyncratic versions of <span class="roman">Bible</span> stories on BBC Home Service's &#145;Lift Up Your Hearts&#146;. They became so popular that before long he had several radio series built around him as biblical raconteur, leading to the publication of pamphlets that in turn led to books, which then featured in television series. In the latter his square beard, heavy spectacles, and thoughtfully furrowed brow became his instantly recognizable trade mark. The stories were his own interpretations of incidents in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, such as Jonah and the whale. Possibly because he would now be dealing with Christian beliefs, and might be thought to be mocking people other than himself, he was less at ease when he moved on from the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> to the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, admitting that he had done so only after numerous requests by the BBC. His play, <span class="italic">Big Night for Shylock</span>, was produced in 1968. His prayer book, <span class="italic">You Have a Minute, Lord?</span> (1977), was more characteristic, a logical extension of his flair for inoffensive humour. One of the texts was &#145;Must a person suffer fools, Lord?&#146;, which addressed the biblical injunction to make time for other people:<blockquote>
<div>But <i>all</i> people, Lord? <i>All?</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>The bigoted, the ignorant, the intolerant,<br>
</div>
<div>the small-minded, the envious, the<br>
</div>
<div>self-centred, the vain, the patronising,<br>
</div>
<div>the phoney, the wicked?<br>
</div>
<div>
<i>Must I, Lord?</i>
<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">You Have a Minute, Lord?</span>, 31&#150;2)</blockquote>Kossoff's other books included <span class="italic">Bible Stories Retold by David Kossoff</span> (1968), <span class="italic">The Book of Witnesses</span> (1971), <span class="italic">The Three Donkeys</span> (1972), <span class="italic">The Voices of Masada</span> (1973), <span class="italic">The Little Book of Sylvanus</span> (1975), <span class="italic">A Town is a World</span> (1979), based on nineteenth-century Russian Jewish folk tales, <span class="italic">Sweet Nutcracker</span> (1985), and <span class="italic">The Old and the New</span> (2002). He wrote many of them, or corrected their proofs, while waiting in his theatre or studio dressing room to make his entry in plays, and claimed that his passion for writing was helped by the fact that he had never had a rejection slip. He was also highly popular in his one-man show based on reflections about religious matters, &#145;As According to Kossoff&#146;, which toured from 1970. Once his show consisted of him in a real restaurant, joining diners at their various tables, talking to them, and ultimately involving them in the act. This particular run was comparatively short.<br>
<br>Kossoff's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72966/', "Paul Kossoff (1950&#150;1976)")</script>, guitarist with the rock group Free, died at the age of twenty-five of a heart attack as the result of drug addiction. Kossoff had abandoned much of his other work to campaign against drugs when his son had had an earlier heart attack and appeared to have successfully given up drugs. When the withdrawal was not after all a success and Paul died Kossoff travelled widely, performing <span class="italic">The Late Great Paul</span> as a memorial to him, taking no money for himself. He could laugh at himself for usually being more financially minded. After he had made many lucrative commercials, he pointed out that <span class="roman">Bible</span> stories didn't pay extraordinarily well, but commercials did&#151;and anyway &#145;it just occurred to me that God might have guided my hand to J. Walter Thompson&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 24 March 2005). He lived latterly at 45 Roe Green Close, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire. His wife predeceased him in 1995 and he died of cancer of the colon at St Christopher's Nursing Home, Drakes Way, Hatfield, on 23 March 2005. He was survived by his son Simon.<br>
