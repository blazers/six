<span class="headword">Higgins,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1544, <em>d.</em> in or before 1620), <span class="occ">poet and linguist</span>, was a student at Christ Church, Oxford (according to Thomas Hearne), though his name does not appear in the university register. From about the age of twenty he began to &#145;learne the tongues&#146;  (Higgins, 130), specializing in French and Latin. He spent two years (probably 1569&#150;70) teaching grammar, after which he began work on a new and thoroughly revised edition of Richard Howlet or Huloet's <span class="italic">Abecedarium</span> (1552), published in 1572 as <span class="italic">Huloets Dictionarie</span>. His next project in the field of languages was an expanded edition of Nicholas Udall's <span class="italic">Flowers, or, Eloquent phrases of the Latine speach, gathered out of the sixe comoedies of Terence</span> (1575), which earned the praise of Thomas Newton in his <span class="italic">Encomia</span> (1589). Higgins also claimed to have: &#145;translated Aldus phrases fraught / With eloquence&#146;  (Higgins, 131), but this work, if published, has not been identified. In 1585 he published another translation, <span class="italic">The Nomenclator, or, Remembrancer of Adrianus Junius</span> (1585). By 1574, when he claimed to be not yet thirty, Higgins was vicar of Winsham, Somerset, where he was still dwelling in 1585 when he wrote the dedication to <span class="italic">The Nomenclator</span>. His last published work was <span class="italic">An Answer to Master William Perkins Concerning Christ's Descension into Hell</span> (1602).<br>
<br>Although less accomplished as a poet than as a linguist, Higgins is today best remembered for his efforts in verse. A commendatory poem prefixed to <span class="italic">Huloets Dictionarie</span> by Thomas Churchyard suggests that by 1572 Higgins was keeping company with poets. In the same year his first published verses appeared, prefixed to John Sadler's translation entitled <span class="italic">The Foure Bookes of Flavius Vegetius Renatus</span>. His most important work, published in 1574, is <span class="italic">The First Parte of the &#145;Mirour for Magistrates&#146;</span>. This was designed as a supplement to William Baldwin's <span class="italic">Myrroure for Magistrates</span> (1559), a compilation of poetic complaints by characters drawn from late medieval English history. Higgins took up Baldwin's hint that the project should be expanded backwards to cover British antiquity from the earliest beginnings. Using as his source the fabulous history of Geoffrey of Monmouth (which he claimed to have once owned in manuscript), Higgins produced sixteen complaints (or &#145;tragedies&#146;) by unfortunate ancient Britons <span class="italic">From the Comming of Brute to the Incarnation of our Saviour and Redemer Jesu Christe</span>. This work includes a few autobiographical stanzas following the tragedy of Mempricius which are the main source of information about Higgins's early career. A second edition followed in 1575, with additional passages and one new complaint. In 1587 Higgins's complaints were published in one volume with the original <span class="italic">Mirror</span>. For this volume Higgins wrote twenty-three new complaints by ancient Britons and Romans, as well as contributing the complaint of Sir Nicholas Burdet to the latter section of the volume.<br>
<br>Higgins has been sharply blamed by Lily Campbell and subsequent critics for violating the integrity of the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> project. It is true that his literary skills were barely adequate to the task he set himself, and he seems not to have fully grasped the original <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s political aims. Intentionally or otherwise, he transformed <span class="italic">The Mirror</span> from a collection of cautionary tales into a dictionary of national (and fervently nationalist) biography. Thus, while he may have diluted the politics of the anthology, he helped ensure its enduring popularity among Elizabethan and later readers. His tragedy of Cordila is thought to have influenced both Shakespeare's <span class="italic">King Lear</span> and the description of the cave of despair in Spenser's <span class="italic">Faerie Queene</span> (book 1, canto 9). The parish records at Winsham show that his successor as vicar took up his position in 1620, indicating that Higgins died in or before that date.<br>
