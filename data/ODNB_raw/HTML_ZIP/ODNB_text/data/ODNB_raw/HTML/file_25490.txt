<span class="headword">Shuttlewood,  John</span>  (1632&#150;1689), <span class="occ">clergyman, ejected minister, and nonconformist tutor</span>, was born on 3 January 1632 at Wymeswold, Leicestershire, the son of William Shuttlewood of Wymeswold. After attending grammar school in Leicester he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1650, and elected a scholar in 1651. He married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1635&#150;1705), daughter of Humphrey Carter of Draycot, Derbyshire, on 26 April 1652. Having been approved by the Wirksworth classis, Shuttlewood was ordained on 26 April 1654 as the minister of Ravenstone, Derbyshire, apparently in the place of Samuel Hacksup. Shuttlewood appears to have held the rectory with the perpetual curacy of Hugglescote in Leicestershire. An English translation of his confession of faith, given originally in Latin, was published in Samuel Palmer's <span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>.<br>
<br>As an intruding minister Shuttlewood was displaced from Ravenstone in 1660 on the return of Hacksup, the sequestrated minister, and presumably ejected from Hugglescote on his refusal to conform in 1662. By 1669 he had retired to Stoke Golding, a parish on the Warwickshire border near Hinckley in Leicestershire. He was an active nonconformist minister and was reported in the 1669 conventicle returns as preaching in eight parishes around Hinckley, Market Harborough, and Lutterworth in south-west Leicestershire, generally with Matthew Clarke, another ejected minister. He was cited in the archdeaconry court for taking part in the burial of Samuel Hall, a nonconformist gentleman, in Sibson church, in defiance of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. Shuttlewood was to be considerably troubled by informers, in particular Charles Gibbons, a quarter-master in the trained bands. In December 1668 thirty or forty horsemen with drawn swords surprised Shuttlewood and many others at a meeting, during the singing of a psalm. Taken before William Street, a county magistrate, Shuttlewood was sent to prison on refusing to promise that he would attend his parish church the following Sunday, despite his never having been charged with being absent from church. He remained in prison until 24 February. Soon after the second <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> came into force Gibbons surprised him and six or seven others at a house in Theddingworth. Although Gibbons would not swear to its being a conventicle, the men were convicted upon notorious evidence, and Shuttlewood was distrained &pound;20 as the preacher. In May 1672 he obtained a licence under Charles II's declaration of indulgence to preach as a presbyterian at his own house in Lubenham, near Market Harborough. Despite the licence Gibbons took him before a justice, who at first refused to act but subsequently issued warrants. In February 1674 Gibbons interrupted another meeting at Shuttlewood's house in Lubenham, and, though appointed to appear before the justices, those present were never summoned but were distrained none the less. Gibbons's death in December 1675, after falling in a ditch and drowning when returning home drunk, removed Shuttlewood's worst tormentor, but he still found it necessary to make frequent moves to avoid arrest and finally moved to Northamptonshire. Edward Pearse, in his <span class="italic">Conformist's Fourth Plea</span> (1683), included details of Shuttlewood's sufferings. In a letter to Richard Baxter, Pearse also provided an account of Shuttlewood's attempts to gather meetings at Little Creaton, where he lived, and Welford, in Northamptonshire, shortly after James II issued in his indulgence in 1687.<br>
<br>Shuttlewood conducted one of the earliest nonconformist academies, preparing candidates for the ministry at Sulby, near Welford, from the late 1670s. Because of the troubled times he only educated &#145;a Few, (and it was but a Few)&#146; students, though they &#145;proved valuable and useful Men&#146; (Calamy, <span class="italic">Funeral Sermon</span>, 34; Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 2.587). There are few details about the academy or Shuttlewood's teaching. His students included Thomas Emlyn, who entered in 1678 and stayed four years, though he briefly left after only a year to enter Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1679 because of his dissatisfaction with Shuttlewood's library, which consisted of &#145;very few books, and them chiefly of one sort&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.vi).<br>
<br>The Shuttlewoods' only son, John Shuttlewood (1667&#150;1737), was minister of Mill Yard Independent meeting, Goodman's Field, London, and his youngest daughter married Thomas Gibbons, tutor at Homerton Academy. Gibbons had a number of Shuttlewood's manuscripts which Palmer used in his <span class="italic">Nonconformist's Memorial</span>. Shuttlewood died at Little Creaton on 17 March 1689 and was buried in the churchyard. His monument inscription recorded that he was &#145;Multum dilectus multum deflendus&#146; (&#145;greatly loved, greatly to be mourned&#146;).<br>
