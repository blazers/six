<span class="headword">Whitehead,  David</span>  (1790&#150;1865), <span class="occ">cotton manufacturer</span>, was born on 11 December 1790 at Meadowhead in the Forest of Rossendale, Lancashire, the fourth of the eight children of John Whitehead (<i>c</i>.1732&#150;1802), a yeoman, and his second wife, Ann (1760&#150;1849), the daughter of Lionel Blakey of Marsden and his second wife, Mary. Whitehead's father, a widower, had six surviving children from his first marriage; seven survived from his second. Both parents converted to Methodism after hearing John Wesley preach in Burnley. On the death of her husband, Ann and her seven children moved to a cottage at Brockclough, where she took up hand-loom weaving.<br>
<br>Whitehead's childhood interest in constructing such devices as miniature water-wheels led him to consider becoming a joiner or a mechanic. His formative years, however, encompassed many different jobs, for, as he admitted, he quickly became bored with a task once he had mastered it. Yet as most jobs were textile oriented, he gained valuable insights into diverse aspects of that industry. During this time he also devoted much attention to improving his education. He was largely self-taught, and his keenness to study often caused his work to suffer; however, he considered education a springboard for later advancement.<br>
<br>Whitehead exercised shrewd calculation in his approach to life, even volunteering for the part-time local militia (<i>c</i>.1808) rather than risking the ballot for full-time service in the regular militia, which could take him anywhere in Britain. His decision minimized time away from home and work, and helped to augment his income. He usually balanced the cost and benefit of any action that he contemplated. With this foresight, coupled with strength of will, firmness of decision, and a certain charm, he courted, and often won, people's generosity.<br>
<br>Although the beginnings of his textile manufacturing business were marked by several false starts, Whitehead learned the value of informal social contacts with potential investors. About 1811 he entered into partnership with his brothers Thomas and Peter to commence cotton manufacturing, while at the same time working as a warper for another employer. There he invented a more efficient method of warping, boosting his production to the envy of fellow workers. In 1817 the brothers invested in an established spinning mill on Balladen Brook, near Rawtenstall, in partnership with William Clegg, whom they later bought out.<br>
<br>About this time Whitehead converted to Wesleyan Methodism. Following a formal though not unromantic courtship, on 7 July 1818 he married Elizabeth, the daughter of Jonathan Wood, a farmer of Dovesyke, West Bradford. Wood, not convinced of the long-term viability of Lancashire's industrial acceleration, insisted that, before marrying Elizabeth, Whitehead should buy a farm as a financial safeguard, which he did. The marriage produced eleven children, nine of whom survived to maturity.<br>
<br>Whitehead's cotton enterprise continued to expand, and in 1822 he purchased land in Rawtenstall to construct Higher Mill. However, the 1826 hand-loom weavers' protest against power-looms saw the Whiteheads' equipment smashed, along with those of other local manufacturers. East Lancashire came under military control, and many mills were supplied with arms and ammunition. Soldiers disguised as civilian workers were posted in Whitehead's mill after the military learned from spies of a plan to burn it down and assassinate him. Although the plot was abandoned, Whitehead stayed silent on possible reasons for his proposed demise. This is curious, as his brothers were not likewise threatened. Grievances generated in the community, along with envy at his success, may have played a part. Perhaps too a certain annoying smug self-righteousness may be attributed to him, though, while strong in his faith, he was no zealot. A letter reveals the ease with which he dovetailed religion and business: &#145;Trade and commerce I still pursue with delight &hellip; I am quite convinced I am in the way providence designed for me&#146;  (Whitehead, Memoir, 139&#150;40).<br>
<br>Whitehead's largest project, the construction of two new cotton mills at Holly Mount, Rawtenstall, began in 1833. He and his brother Peter surveyed the site and designed the buildings. 800 power-looms were envisaged. Houses for the workforce, and a school to educate them and their children, were also constructed. In 1836 Whitehead founded a savings bank for employees and encouraged the Temperance Society (he himself became teetotal). Ever the paternalist, he was &#145;anxious to give the best possible education to the working class, and particularly to our own workpeople&#146;  (Whitehead, Memoir, 150). While young scholars paid for their education, the revenue was placed in a provident trust, deposited in Whitehead's bank, and returned with interest once the child reached the age of twenty-one. William Cooke Taylor commented on such benevolence in 1842. However, while Whitehead highlighted benefits provided for his workforce, he played down advantages to himself. For instance, he saw technological advance as an opportunity for workers to earn more, while simultaneously reducing piece-rates.<br>
<br>A staunch believer in free trade, Whitehead was a vociferous member of the Manchester Anti-Corn Law Association (later the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42282', "Anti-Corn Law League")</script>) with his friend Richard Cobden. While campaigning for the repeal of the laws he even inflicted lectures upon fellow rail travellers. Keen to help the working class &#145;understand their political rights&#146;  (Whitehead, Memoir, 183), he advocated saving to become 40 <i>s</i>. freeholders, thereby qualifying to send representatives to parliament. In 1846 he bluffed his way into the House of Lords to witness the repeal of the corn laws. He established the Rawtenstall branch of the Peace Society (1848), and as a delegate attended the Brussels and Paris peace congresses. In 1851 he was appointed a county magistrate. A commentator of his times, Whitehead was often closely involved in the activities he observed. At once a paternalist yet a radical, he was a humanitarian and advocate of working-class political involvement. By 1855 the Whitehead brothers' business had become unwieldy and was divided between them. At the time of his death, on 28 January 1865, at his home, Holly Mount, Rawtenstall, Whitehead and his sons had built a thriving manufacturing concern in their own right. Whitehead, who was survived by his wife, was buried at Longholme Wesleyan Chapel, Rawtenstall.<br>
