<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McNeillie,  John Kincaid</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ian Niall]</span>  (1916&#150;2002), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 7 November 1916 at Old Kilpatrick, near Dalmuir, Dunbartonshire, the eldest of the four surviving children of Robert McNeillie (1889&#150;1959), then a journeyman engine-fitter and later a foreman, and his wife, Jean Kincaid, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McDougall (1893&#150;1957). A little before the death of his younger sister Ellen (some time after May 1919) John was sent to live with his paternal grandparents, John McNeillie and Elizabeth McGarva, and his aunts at North Clutag, Wigtownshire. By removing their son from Dalmuir John's parents hoped that he would not fall victim to the meningitis epidemic that killed his sister. He spent about five years at North Clutag, during which time he attended Malzie village school before returning to Dalmuir. In 1926 McNeillie's father lost his job and was forced to take work with an engineering firm in Hayes, Middlesex. The family settled in Southall, west of London, where John was educated at Southall county school, with summer holidays spent with his grandparents in North Clutag.<br>
<br>McNeillie left school aged seventeen with the intention of becoming a writer and took a job on the <span class="italic">West Middlesex Gazette</span>. The novelist and journalist Neil Munro was his second cousin and a confiding friend of his maternal grandfather, so there was a precedent within the family. In either 1935 or 1936 he met Sheila Cynthia Hoyles (<i>b</i>. 1920), the daughter of Thomas Hoyles, chauffeur and taxi driver. At the end of their first evening together, he dropped a note down the back of her dress which read: &#145;John McNeillie. One day this name will be famous&#146;  (McNeillie, 2). The couple were married at Southall, Middlesex, on 8 June 1940 and had one daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>In 1936 McNeillie began work on his first novel&#151;and one of his best-known works&#151;<span class="italic">Wigtown Ploughman: Part of his Life</span>, which was published in March 1939. The novel depicts the relentless poverty, depravity, and violence of the rural community in the Machars district of Wigtownshire, told through the early life of the stubborn, hostile, and terrifying Andy Walker. <span class="italic">Wigtown Ploughman</span> provoked strong reactions from reviewers who praised its realism or condemned its amorality, and it gained a much wider audience from serialization in the Glasgow <span class="italic">Sunday Mail</span> from April 1939. This generated a fierce debate on the extent to which real-life social conditions were a cause of the behaviour depicted in the novel, with questions raised in the House of Commons on the poor quality of Wigtownshire housing. McNeillie followed <span class="italic">Wigtown Ploughman</span> with <span class="italic">Glasgow Keelie</span> (1940), the story of another outsider, Jimmie Lunn, who gives up his apprenticeship for gambling and gang violence. Both works were taught as set texts in Scottish secondary schools in the early twentieth-first century.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of war McNeillie attempted to join the RAF but was persuaded by his father to take work at a precision tool engineering firm in north-west London, with the intention that he would then open a new factory at Old Colwyn, near Colwyn Bay in Denbighshire. In 1940 McNeillie and his wife moved to Coed Coch Road, Old Colwyn, where they lived for the next nineteen years and where he combined a writing career with full-time employment in engineering. McNeillie's next book, <span class="italic">No Resting Place</span> (1948), was the first he published under the pseudonym Ian Niall, which he subsequently used for all of his books and journalism. Like <span class="italic">Wigtown Ploughman</span> and <span class="italic">Glasgow Keelie</span>, <span class="italic">No Resting Place</span> is a story of wandering and rebellious people&#151;on this occasion a band of travellers situated in an indeterminate Galloway or Ireland. The novel's violent conclusion, which McNeillie refused to alter, led to its being rejected by his publisher, Putnam, and taken up by Heinemann. Reviewers in Britain and the United States assumed this to be a first novel by a previously unknown writer, Ian Niall, and praised its authenticity, pace, and lack of sentimentality. The book's success resulted in a film version, directed by Paul Rotha and first screened in 1951, which despite favourable reviews did not reach general release.<br>
<br>Since his move to Old Colwyn McNeillie had greatly enjoyed exploring and observing the countryside of north Wales, as he had that around North Clutag. In late 1950 he published <span class="italic">The Poacher's Handbook</span>, which recounted the stories of real-life underdogs, from Wigtownshire and Denbighshire, similar to those who populated his earlier fiction. Selections from the book first appeared in <span class="italic">Country Life</span> (August 1950) and led to McNeillie's long association with the journal as author of the weekly &#145;A countryman's notes&#146; from 1953. <span class="italic">The Poacher's Handbook</span>, with illustrations by the woodcut artist Barbara Greg, was widely and favourably reviewed and remained in print in the early twenty-first century. While continuing to publish fiction&#151;works from this period include <span class="italic">Tune on a Melodeon</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Foxhollow</span> (1949), a barbed comedy of missing persons and neighbourhood spies, and the unpublished &#145;The Wick Burned Low&#146; (1947), his professedly favourite novel&#151;McNeillie now established his reputation as a writer on natural history and rural sports. A keen fly-fisherman, between 1954 and 1956 he edited the monthly journal <span class="italic">Angling</span>, and in 1961 published <span class="italic">Trout from the Hills</span>. In addition to writing for <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, McNeillie also contributed a column of the same name for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, which appeared alongside John Betjeman's &#145;City and suburban&#146; column until 1957. In the 1960s McNeillie wrote two studies of his early life at North Clutag: <span class="italic">A Galloway Childhood</span> (1967, illustrated by Charles Tunnicliffe, whose biography McNeillie wrote in 1980) and <span class="italic">My Childhood</span>, published posthumously in 2004 under his real name. Two later works, <span class="italic">A Galloway Shepherd</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">To Speed the Plough</span> (1977), described the rural life of his grandfather and of modern chemical farming respectively.<br>
<br>McNeillie's work as a storyteller was admirable and ancestral, and his feeling for landscape is equal to that of John Buchan. The harshness of much of his fiction recalls the Ayrshire writer George Douglas Brown, whose 1901 novel, <span class="italic">The House with the Green Shutters</span>, rejected the sentimentality of the kailyard school of Scottish writers. Reviewers of <span class="italic">Wigtown Ploughman</span> also drew parallels with the novels of Lewis Grassic Gibbon and D. H. Lawrence, while McNeillie was himself attracted to the realism of John Steinbeck and (notably for <span class="italic">No Resting Place</span>) the subject matter of the Irish writer J. M. Synge. As Ian Niall, however, he increasingly turned away from realism and came to reject his first novel for its crudity, writing later that &#145;No one who writes about life does life justice by being a realist&#146;  (McNeillie, 46).<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life John McNeillie and his wife moved to a house, Five Acres, at Ashley Green, Buckinghamshire. He died, following a stroke, on 24 June 2002 at Hemel Hempstead Hospital, and was survived by Sheila and their three children. His body was cremated at Amersham crematorium on 1 July and his ashes were scattered&#151;and watered in with Bladnoch whisky&#151;at North Clutag. In 2003 his legacy of more than forty books and two million words of journalism was acknowledged with the opening of the John McNeillie Library in Wigtown, now one of Scotland's leading literary centres.<br>
