<span class="headword">Clayton <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Needham]</span>,  Ellen Creathorne</span>  (1834&#150;1900), <span class="occ">author and artist</span>, was born in Gloucester Terrace, Dublin, on 15 February 1834, the eldest child and only daughter of Benjamin Clayton (1809&#150;1883), an engraver and illustrator, and his wife, Mary Graham (<i>d</i>. 1877). She had two surviving brothers, Albert Victor Clayton and Herbert Benjamin Clayton, both of whom became engravers.<br>
<br>In 1841 the Clayton family moved from Dublin to London. From an early age, Ellen Clayton, in imitation of her father, was &#145;constantly scribbling with pen or with pencil&#146;  (Clayton, 2.325). By the time she was fourteen, her stories were appearing in <span class="italic">Chat</span>, an ephemeral periodical owned by her father. After its demise some three years later, Benjamin Clayton and his associates started a comic weekly, <span class="italic">Punchinello</span>, for which Ellen wrote and drew &#145;humorous (and numerous) designs&#146;  (ibid.) for eighteen months. She also drew illustrations for children's books and wrote several juvenile works.<br>
<br>Her elder brother was now studying art in the British Museum and the National Gallery, and Ellen Clayton, thinking that art would provide a better livelihood than literature, followed his example. In the galleries she met and made friends with other women artists, such as Laura Herford, and in 1859 she was a signatory of the women artists' petition for full admission to the schools of the Royal Academy of Arts. She appears to have abandoned her artistic ambitions when the publishing company Dean &amp; Son asked her to write a series of female biographies for young girls, in monthly parts. &#145;Quite sensible of her own shortcomings&#146; as an artist  (Clayton, 2.326), Clayton relinquished her gallery studies, although she continued to produce watercolours, studies of still life, etchings, and comic drawings.<br>
<br>The biographies of <span class="italic">Notable Women</span>, which began publication in 1859 with a topical and hopelessly adulatory account of the career of Florence Nightingale, proved successful. The lives of the subjects promoted traditional feminine virtues&#151;filial and wifely devotion, piety, purity, and charity. Clayton's firmly protestant opinions were apparent in her next work, <span class="italic">Women of the Reformation</span> (1861), also published by Dean &amp; Son and possibly illustrated, rather ineptly, by Clayton herself. The heroines featured in this derivative and anecdotal work included Anne Boleyn, Anne Askew, Lady Jane Grey, and Anne Hooper. A further series of biographies, <span class="italic">Celebrated Women</span>, was later published by Dean &amp; Son in 1875.<br>
<br>In 1863 Clayton published her most successful novel, <span class="italic">Miss Milly Moss, or, Sunlight and Shade</span>, a coy domestic romance for young girls illustrated by her friend Florence Claxton. This was sufficiently popular to merit republication in 1895 as <span class="italic">A Ministering Angel</span>. The more ambitious <span class="italic">Cruel Fortune</span> (3 vols., 1865) followed: it was a confused, sensationalistic work, which Clayton seems to have found difficult to sell, as publishers found it &#145;painfully morbid&#146;  (Clayton, 2.328). She continued to produce rather unsuccessful fiction: <span class="italic">Playing for Love</span> (1876), the tale of a young widow vacillating between two suitors, met with a very cool reception in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, where the reviewer commented on the lack of &#145;analysis of character, or descriptive writing of any sort&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 29 July 1876, 143).<br>
<br>After finishing <span class="italic">Miss Milly Moss</span>, Ellen Clayton began to research &#145;a work of some importance&#146;  (Clayton, 2.327), <span class="italic">The Queens of Song</span> (2 vols., 1863), a collection of biographical accounts of leading female opera singers from the seventeenth century to the nineteenth. Partly to collect information for this work and partly to &#145;seek relief from a sad and irksome life&#146;  (ibid.), she visited Paris, possibly as a lady's companion; she later recalled bitterly how social engagements had deprived her of the chance to visit the Louvre.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Queens of Song</span> was favourably reviewed, and Clayton was invited to write for <span class="italic">London Society</span>, under the &#145;pleasant editorship&#146; of James Hogg, who became a supportive friend. Simultaneously, she was contributing short stories, essays, and comic drawings to <span class="italic">Judy</span> and other periodicals and magazines. Another novel was published in a weekly journal, and she also wrote several juvenile works, including <span class="italic">Topsy Turvy</span> and <span class="italic">The World Turned Upside Down</span>, both published in 1876. Probably in financial straits, she also painted and designed valentines, calendars, and cards for several commercial houses, including Rimmell of the Strand.<br>
<br>On the strength of <span class="italic">The Queens</span>, Ellen Clayton approached the publisher William Tinsley, for whom she wrote her best-known and most valuable work, <span class="italic">English Female Artists</span> (2 vols., 1876). In the first volume of this work she covered female artists active in England from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth; the second volume dealt with living artists, among whom featured Helen Allingham, Louise Jopling, Anna Blunden, and Lady Butler. A reviewer in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> criticized the work for excessive length, describing it as inflated with unnecessary domestic details and an &#145;infinity of small reflexions&#146; on the merits of each artist. The critic preferred the first volume to the second, arguing that, although neither original nor authoritative, the accounts of past women artists were useful and readable  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 22 July 1876, 119&#150;20). Ironically, the second volume has proved to be the more significant: based on questionnaires completed by the artists, it contains a wealth of biographical information about Clayton's women contemporaries. Nevertheless, the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> critic was not without insight: although a more weighty publication than Elizabeth Ellet's <span class="italic">Women Artists of All Ages and Countries</span> (1859), Clayton's <span class="italic">English Female Artists</span> shared the tendency of Victorian biographies of women artists to concentrate on anecdotes and reminiscences, commenting little on the subjects' artistic development and portraying their lives as uneventful and ultimately feminine. Nevertheless, Clayton did not ignore the difficulties experienced by women artists, including parental opposition, lack of access to formal training, and straitened finances, and she celebrated with <i>&eacute;lan</i> their critical successes.<br>
<br>The more radical aspects of Clayton's biographies were confirmed in her next work for Tinsley, <span class="italic">Female Warriors</span> (2 vols., 1879). A critic in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, although shocked by this robust account of military-minded women from the Amazons to the Maid of Saragossa, commented only half-jokingly that Clayton had &#145;shown conclusively that when women do get into Parliament, we may fairly expect them &hellip; to be ready, in case of emergency, to abandon their legislative functions for the barrack and battlefield&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 1353). On 15 February 1879 she married James Henry Needham (<i>d</i>. 1892), who worked for a legal firm in Woolwich. She appears to have published only a couple of works for young girls after her marriage, which may have provided her with some financial stability.<br>
<br>Ellen Clayton died childless in St Elizabeth's Home at 59 Mortimer Street, London, on 19 July 1900. In his <span class="italic">Random Recollections</span> of the same year, William Tinsley recalled with sympathy that this &#145;good, hard-working little woman&#146; had &#145;dragged out a poor existence&#146;  (Tinsley, 2.335): it is tempting to speculate that Clayton's miserable career as a literary and artistic hack had fuelled her increasingly radical views on women's past and present condition.<br>
