<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collcutt,  Thomas Edward</span>  (1840&#150;1924), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 16 March 1840 in Jericho, Oxford, the son of James Collcutt, servant at St John's College, Oxford, and his wife, Emma, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blake. He was educated at the Oxford diocesan school, Cowley, Oxford. Articled to R. W. Armstrong of London in 1856, he later worked in the office of Mills and Murgatroyd of Manchester, in G. E. Street's office, and in the Brighton town surveyor's office (1867&#150;9), before establishing his own practice in the City of London, initially with H. Woodzell. In 1871 the partnership was placed first in the Blackburn Free Library and Museum competition, a &#145;mildly Gothic&#146; building with &#145;touches in the direction of the Arts and Crafts&#146;  (Pevsner, <span class="italic">North Lancashire</span>, 1969, 64), indicative of Collcutt's way ahead. Exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1873 from 12 Finsbury Place South, by 1875 Collcutt had moved his office to 17 Essex Street, Strand, and was engaged on houses at Mill Hill. He built a house for himself and another for a doctor at Ravenscourt Park, Hammersmith: &#145;inexpensive domestic work marked by intuitive taste and a cultured individuality&#146;  (Adams, 24). Other houses followed, at Sheen and elsewhere. About 1878 he moved to a large, red brick house, again of his own design, at 36 Bloomsbury Square (dem.). The sanitary engineer George Jennings introduced him to terracotta, which he first used in houses for Jennings in Nightingale Lane, Clapham. Collcutt's reputation as a house architect caused him to be invited to design one for the 1878 Paris Exhibition's street of houses. Picturesque and half-timbered, his houses were found comfortable to live in and easy to work. In the 1890s and 1900s he designed additional buildings for Mill Hill School and boarding-houses for Eton College.<br>
<br>It was, however, the success of his powerfully original design in local stone in the Wakefield town hall competition (1877) that put Collcutt in the first rank of English architects. An assiduous competitor, so keen was Collcutt to win at Wakefield that he put in two designs, one in Gothic, the other in the Queen Anne style. Street, the assessor, recognizing that they were by the same hand, placed the Queen Anne design first, and told the promoters &#145;that if they liked to have the other that was first also&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 15, 1907&#150;8, 10). In 1887 Collcutt was successful in a competition of six architects invited to design the Imperial Institute in South Kensington, commemorating Queen Victoria's jubilee. Important commissions multiplied, and in 1890 he was engaged on the English Opera House exterior (1889&#150;93; later the Palace Theatre) at Cambridge Circus for D'Oyly Carte, the Bechstein (later Wigmore) Hall, and the City Bank, Ludgate Hill. Characteristic in all these buildings was his employment of a pale buff terracotta of larger size and more complex modelling than that which Waterhouse made fashionable: Phillips's China and Glass Emporium (later Waring's), 175&#150;181 Oxford Street, was the precursor. Walter Smith was Collcutt's modeller, Doulton his manufacturer. The 1890s were the outstanding period of his work, comprising &#145;the delicacy and minuteness of detail and ornament combined with the largeness and simplicity of form which are the outstanding features of his designs&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 31, 1923&#150;4, 667). In the lavish Lloyd's Registry of Shipping, Fenchurch Street (1900), his use of Portland stone produced broader, bolder features in a baroque version of arts and crafts.<br>
<br>Soon after the erection of the Savoy Hotel, D'Oyly Carte had employed Collcutt on some interiors, followed in 1905 by an extension to the Strand, faced in Doulton's Carrara blocks of creamy matt-glazed terracotta designed to cope with London's sooty climate, an example of Collcutt's care for the practical; he employed him again for the extension on the river front (1910). Collcutt designed furniture as a hobby, and interior design and furniture became an important side of his practice. A notable interior in 1894 was the opulent King's Hall in the Holborn Restaurant (dem.). He also worked for the Peninsular and Oriental Line, designing music saloons for several liners in 1896&#150;7, suites in liners subsequently, pavilions at international exhibitions, and hotels at Algeciras and Colombo (1912). In 1904 Gloucester House, a gabled block of flats in green and white striped faience, broke the skyline on Piccadilly and Park Lane; the John Lewis store, Oxford Street, however, was reckoned a failure.<br>
<br>Collcutt, like his sometime master Street, was ferociously energetic in his daily office work. &#145;Always the most practical of constructors&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 31, 1923&#150;4, 667), he employed an instructor two or three times a week to expound construction to his staff, which included L. Stokes and J. S. Gibson. From 1908 he was in partnership with Stanley Hinge Hamp. &#145;Singularly simple and direct in the statement of his views&#146;, Collcutt &#145;gave a lead and developed a rendering of the movement of the day, characteristic of his own genius &hellip; it was a thoroughly English rendering of the Renaissance&#146;  (ibid., 668). He had, said Beresford Pite, the capacity to design charming buildings &#145;which displayed extraordinary vigour and grip, and that peculiar power to design Gothic works as they really were supposed to be&#146;  (<span class="italic">RIBA Journal</span>, 3rd ser., 15, 1907&#150;8, 11), work that evoked enthusiasm among the younger generation of architects. Marked by successful composition and grouping, his elevations were ruled by contrasting lines of subdivision and by carefully considered ornamentation. Collcutt received the RIBA gold medal in 1902. He was much concerned with professional questions, such as the proper management of competitions (he organized a petition in 1876 in favour of boycotting them unless there were a professional assessor), and he was intensely interested in architectural education. A man of innate modesty, though of strong opinions, he was reluctant to become president of the RIBA in 1906, but he was seen as &#145;a model of integrity&#146;  (ibid., 14, 1906&#150;7, 10), his &#145;wisdom of judgment and sympathy with earnest effort &hellip; [endearing] him to all who knew him&#146;  (ibid., 31, 1923&#150;4, 667). He was re-elected for a second term in 1907. Among the issues he brought forward was the idea of moving the Charing Cross railway terminus to the south bank of the Thames, and constructing a street bridge with arcaded buildings. In 1906 he was one of eight architects invited by the London county council to design fa&ccedil;ades for Kingsway, but finding the conditions unacceptable he withdrew. Anxious to improve London, particularly in terms of housing for the working classes, he urged replacing slums by towers of flats eight or ten storeys high, and published a small book on this theme in 1923.<br>
<br>Collcutt was an impressive figure, bearded, with high forehead and aquiline nose, genial in personality, with many friends. He formed a notable collection of clocks. On 30 April 1868 he married a Londoner, Emily Green or Tagg (1844&#150;1906), and they had two sons and four daughters. At the time of the 1881 census they were supported in Bloomsbury Square by a governess, a cook, and three other young women servants. Later they also lived at West Lodge, Totteridge, Hertfordshire (with stables and coachman's lodge), where Collcutt had built several houses. He died a widower at Grosvenor House Nursing Home, Southampton, on 7 October 1924. After a funeral service four days later he was buried at Totteridge parish church.<br>
