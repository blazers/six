<span class="headword">Pope,  William Burt</span>  (1822&#150;1903), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and theologian</span>, was born at Horton, Nova Scotia, on 19 February 1822, the son of John Pope (1791&#150;1863), Wesleyan missionary, and Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Uglow, who was originally of Stratton, Cornwall. His elder brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35572/', "George Uglow Pope")</script>. After education in England at a village school at Hooe, Devon, and at a secondary school at Saltash, Cornwall, near Plymouth, he spent a year (1837&#150;8) at Bedeque, Prince Edward Island, assisting an uncle, who was a shipbuilder and general merchant. He devoted his leisure to the study of Latin, Greek, French, and German, and was accepted in 1840 by the Cornwall district synod and by the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion as a candidate for the ministry; he entered the Wesleyan Theological Institution at Hoxton, London. There he added Hebrew and Arabic to his stock of languages. In 1842 he began his active ministry at Kingsbridge, Devon, and served for short periods at Liskeard, Jersey, Sandhurst, Dover, and Halifax, and for longer periods in London (City Road), Hull, Manchester, Leeds, and Southport. He married in 1845 Ann Eliza Lethbridge (<i>d</i>. 1894), daughter of a yeoman farmer of Modbury, near Plymouth. Two of their nine children died in early life, leaving four daughters and three sons.<br>
<br>In 1867 Pope succeeded John Hannah the elder as tutor in systematic theology at Didsbury College, Manchester. He received the degree of DD from the Wesleyan University, USA, in 1865 and from the University of Edinburgh in 1877. In 1876 he visited America with James Harrison Rigg as delegate to the general conference of the Methodist Episcopal church at Baltimore. In 1877 he was president of the Wesleyan Methodist conference at Bristol. He resigned his position at Didsbury in 1886. He died, after much suffering from mental depression, on 5 July 1903, at his home, 3 Huddlestone Road, Willesden Green, London, and was buried in Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, London.<br>
<br>Pope's industry was unflagging. He began his day at 4 a.m., and made notable contributions to theological literature, which were deemed authoritative by his own church, and all the while he was actively engaged in the ministry and in teaching. His chief work was the <span class="italic">Compendium of Christian Theology</span> in three volumes (1875; 2nd edn, 1880). His Fernley lecture, &#145;The person of Christ&#146;, delivered in 1871, was translated into German. In 1860 he became editor of the <span class="italic">London Quarterly Review</span>, to which he was already a contributor; his co-editor from 1883 to 1886 was J. H. Rigg. Pope translated from German, in whole or part, three important books for T. and T. Clark's <span class="roman">Theological Library</span>, and he contributed to <span class="roman">Schaff's Popular Commentary</span> expositions of <span class="roman">Ezra</span>, <span class="roman">Nehemiah</span> (1882), and the epistles of <span class="roman">St John</span> (1883).<br>
<br>Pope's massive erudition and sympathy for the mystical tradition in Christianity sometimes combined to produce opaque prose which baffled congregations, students, and readers alike. An early biographer recorded Pope's reaction on reading a section of his own work: &#145;I don't quite know what that means; but the more I think about it, the nearer I come to knowing what I must have meant at the time I wrote it&#146;  (Moss, 87). Contemporaries united in paying tribute to his gentleness and sanctity; he was &#145;the quiet man who walked with God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minutes</span>, 158).<br>
