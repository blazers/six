<span class="headword">Percy,  George</span>  (1580&#150;1632/3), <span class="occ">colonist in America</span>, was the eighth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21938/', "Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland (c.1532&#150;1585)")</script>, and his countess, Katherine Neville (1545/6&#150;1596). He was born at Petworth, Sussex, on 4 September 1580, and was educated at Eton College, Gloucester Hall, Oxford, and the Middle Temple. Georgy Percy was a sickly child, apparently troubled in his youth by epilepsy and other ailments. Current medical thinking held that patients in such cases often prospered in warmer climates. Accordingly he embarked in 1602 on a sea voyage to the West Indies. Little is known about this adventure, but he reappears visiting his brother Sir Richard Percy in Ireland in summer 1603. This early experience of the Americas must surely help to explain why a younger son of a prominent English nobleman is found, five years later, among the band of settlers which established the first enduring English colony in the New World, near the mouth of the James River, in what is today the state of Virginia.<br>
<br>There was another reason. After the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot in November 1605 George's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy (1564&#150;1632)")</script>, the ninth earl, was arrested under suspicion of complicity. Although never shown to have been directly involved, the earl remained a prisoner in the Tower of London for nearly sixteen years, a grievous blow to the fortunes of his family. For a well-travelled younger brother, the prospect of distant horizons and new possibilities must have been welcome. George Percy was almost certainly encouraged in his plans by the earl himself, who collected an impressive geographical library while in the Tower, and retained an abiding interest in exploration.<br>
<br>At first Percy was carried away with the excitement of his new surroundings. The land appeared fertile, and the Virginian Indians seemed friendly. However, his dream rapidly turned sour. The settlers fell out among themselves, supply ships failed to appear, disease and starvation took hold. Treacherous acts on both sides blighted relations with the Native Americans, and a series of horrific slaughters ensued. On one occasion he writes movingly of his unsuccessful attempts to spare the lives of an American Indian &#145;queen&#146; and her children in the face of his men's implacable determination that all should be put to the sword. In 1609, as a senior member of the colony's ruling council, he deputized as its president for six months between the departure of Captain John Smith and the arrival of Sir Thomas Gates, and he did so again for just over one month in 1611. But given the colony's continuing misfortunes and his own recurring ill health he then decided to return home, setting sail for England in April 1612.<br>
<br>Under the terms of a family settlement Percy enjoyed a small annuity derived from rents on lands within the Percy estates in Cumberland and Yorkshire. During his years in America, however, his brother the earl agreed to take this income in return for settling debts which George Percy incurred with London merchants. This was convenient at the time, but the earl was subsequently plagued by opportunists who came to him seeking payment for debts allegedly run up long before. Northumberland's patience with the ostensible creditors eventually wore thin. &#145;This&#146;, he wrote at the foot of one such petition, &#145;I granted not, for I have too many of this nature brought me every day&#146;  (Syon MS X II I, box 21, bundle g).<br>
<br>Percy, as has been noted, kept some form of journal in America. While the original has been lost, extracts were published by Samuel Purchas under the title &#145;Observations gathered out of a discourse of the plantation of the southerne colonie in Virginia by the English&#146;. As it comes down to us, this account breaks off in 1608. In the mid-1620s, however, his former commander John Smith published a self-congratulatory memoir. Percy then wrote his own version of events between 1609 and 1612 to counter Smith's &#145;many untrewthes&#146;. He had sided against Smith in the faction struggles that had engulfed their colony, and his &#145;Trewe relatyon&#146;, which survives in his own hand and remained unpublished for three centuries, is a valuable corrective to Smith's hugely popular book.<br>
<br>Later years are thinly documented. In 1615 he considered joining one Captain Bud on a voyage to the Amazon delta, not least because, as he put it in his letter seeking support from the earl, &#145;my fitts here in England are more often, more longe and more greevous, then I have felt them in other parts neerer the lyne [the equator]&#146;  (Alnwick MSS, letters and papers, vol. 10, fol. 220). Four years later he assumed the role of his family's champion when one Richard Plumleigh slandered the earl's recently deceased countess. He challenged Plumleigh to a duel, and the privy council was forced to compose the quarrel. Thereafter we are left with little more than family tradition, which has it that he commanded a company when war broke out again in the Low Countries in 1627. From the indirect evidence available, he was alive when the ninth earl died in November 1632, but died during the following winter.<br>
<br>In a family of eight brothers only the earl produced a male heir, and the young Lord Percy, later the tenth earl, was made much of by both his father and his numerous uncles, each man seeing the boy as the best hope of restoring their family's fortunes. George Percy named a fort on the Chesapeake Algernon's Fort, in the child's honour, and later dedicated the &#145;Trewe relatyon&#146; to his nephew in very graceful terms.<br>
<br>There is no contemporary evidence to suggest that George Percy ever married. Again, however, family legend credits him with a wife in Virginia. When the genealogist T. C. Banks visited America in the early 1800s he met two brothers Percy&#151;landowners in Virginia&#151;who claimed descent from George. Banks declared that, if what they said was true, they would be &#145;the right male heirs of the earldom of Northumberland of the <i>de novo</i> creation, the ancient one being suspended in the crown&#146;  (Banks, 1.369). The claim was never pursued.<br>
