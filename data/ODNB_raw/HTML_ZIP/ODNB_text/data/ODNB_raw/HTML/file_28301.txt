<span class="headword">Villiers,  John Charles</span>, third earl of Clarendon  (1757&#150;1838), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 14 November 1757, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28302/', "Thomas Villiers, first earl of Clarendon of the second creation (1709&#150;1786)")</script>, diplomatist and politician, and Lady Charlotte Capel (1721&#150;1790), eldest surviving daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4588/', "William Capel, third earl of Essex")</script>, and Jane Hyde. He was educated at Eton College (1766&#150;74) and at St John's College, Cambridge; he graduated MA in 1776 and LLD on 30 April 1838. At Cambridge he met and became friends with William Pitt the younger. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1774 and was called to the bar on 22 June 1779. On 6 February 1782 he was made joint king's counsel in the duchy court of Lancaster by his father, then chancellor of the court.<br>
<br>In January 1784 Villiers was brought into parliament for the pocket borough of Old Sarum by Thomas Pitt, Lord Camelford, at the request of William Pitt. Villiers voted consistently with the administration and was rewarded with several court appointments. He became surveyor of woods south of the Trent on 29 July 1786, and comptroller of the king's household, and was sworn of the privy council on 19 February 1787. In February 1790 he was made a commissioner of the Board of Trade and left his post in the household to accept the sinecure of warden and chief justice in eyre north of the Trent, which brought him an income of &pound;2250 per annum. In the same year he was returned for Dartmouth, which he continued to represent until 1802. He did not make his mark as a debater in parliament but was known as &#145;a mere courtier, famous for telling interminable stories&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries</span>, ed. Jackson, 2.302). The <span class="italic">Rolliad</span> described him as &#145;Villiers, comely with the flaxen hair&#146; and, together with Wraxall, regarded him as &#145;the &#147;Nereus&#148; of Pitt's forces&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Wraxall</span>, 5.112).<br>
<br>On 5 January 1791, at her father's house in Savile Row, Villiers married his first cousin, Maria Eleanor Forbes (1758/9&#150;1844), the younger twin daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9838/', "Admiral John Forbes (1714&#150;1796)")</script> and Lady Mary Capel, daughter of the third earl of Essex. Following the outbreak of war with France, he volunteered to use the income from his sinecure to help raise a regiment of fencible cavalry, to which he was appointed colonel on 14 March 1794. He remained a staunch supporter of Pitt during Addington's administration and was returned on Lady Sutherland's interest for Tain burghs at the general election in 1802. He succeeded as first protonotary of common pleas in the county palatine of Lancaster in 1804, a reversionary sinecure that required him to seek re-election to parliament, which he did, though not without some demur. Pitt's return to office with Addington, which Villiers strongly disapproved of, led him to break formally with Pitt on 10 February 1805 and he gave up his seat in May 1805.<br>
<br>Villiers returned to the Commons as MP for Queenborough in 1807 and, to general astonishment, was chosen by Canning to be envoy to the Portuguese court in 1808. Arriving in Lisbon in November 1808, he did not relish his diplomatic role and asked to be recalled in September 1809, although he did not leave until February 1810. He seems, however, to have established a reasonable relationship with both Wellington and Wellesley and afterwards felt confident to offer advice on policy in the Peninsula. On the death of his elder brother, Thomas, unmarried, on 7 March 1824, Villiers succeeded to the earldom. Thereafter he took little part in political life apart from voting with the whigs in the upper house, and devoted himself to religious and charitable works.<br>
<br>Clarendon died suddenly at his home, Walmer Terrace, Deal, on 22 December 1838, and was buried in Watford on 29 December. He was survived by his wife, who died aged eighty-five at Clarendon House on 18 March 1844. Their only child, Mary Harriet, had died unmarried on 20 January 1835 and so he was succeeded by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28297/', "George William Frederick Villiers")</script> as fourth earl of Clarendon.<br>
