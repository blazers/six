<span class="headword">Dower,  William</span>  (1837&#150;1919), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born in Banchory, south-west of Aberdeen, on 5 November 1837, son of John Dower, a builder, and his wife, Jean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forbes. Like his father, he became a staunch Congregationalist and was apprenticed as a builder, but he attended Aberdeen grammar school and won a bursary to Edinburgh University. There he studied theology and he was ordained in Edinburgh on 28 June 1865. The following month he married Jessie Edward (<i>b</i>. 1838), a childhood friend who like him had strong religious convictions. He had been accepted as a missionary by the London Missionary Society (LMS), and in August 1865 the Dowers sailed for South Africa.<br>
<br>After some weeks in Port Elizabeth they went to Hopedale (later Uniondale), from where William Dower was soon asked to visit the Griqua captain, Adam Kok III (1811&#150;1875), who had requested a missionary. Kok's people, the majority of Khoikhoi origin, had trekked from Griqualand West to what was called Nomansland (later Griqualand East in what became the Transkei) in the mid-1860s. After arranging terms with Kok, Dower, who had by this time learned Dutch, arrived with his family at the Griqua settlement in May 1870. He planned a new town that was given the name Kokstad and assisted the Griqua to move their seat of government there. He became one of Kok's leading confidants at a time (1871) when the first Cape colonial official arrived and announced the &#145;annexation&#146; of the area.<br>
<br>When, in the mid-1870s, the LMS asked Dower to move elsewhere he refused, and his connection with the society ended. After he returned to Kokstad from a visit to Britain in 1878 his salary was paid by the Griqua church. He tried to smooth relations between the new Cape colonial administration and the Griqua, who after Kok's death had gone into an abortive rebellion in 1878 to recover their lost independence. Dower encouraged them to accept individual titles to their land, which impoverished many Griqua, who remained opposed to the colonial administration. He had no sympathy for those Griquas who, under the leadership of Abraham le Fleur, sought to challenge that administration, but in 1889 he did visit Griqualand West and Cape Town in an attempt to recover moneys for some Griqua, without success. By 1891, when he left Kokstad, his relations with the Griqua had become strained, in part because of the time he spent ministering to the white community and because he was increasingly associated by the Griqua with the forces that had lost them their independence and their earlier prosperity.<br>
<br>After he left Kokstad Dower's links with the LMS were restored, and he became one of its directors. He ministered to the coloured congregation at the Union Church in Port Elizabeth until 1912, when he retired to a home he called Banchory at nearby Uitenhage, where he died on 21 December 1919. He had three sons and two daughters; his third son, Edward (<i>d</i>. 1918), became secretary for native affairs after the creation of the Union of South Africa.<br>
<br>Dower helped the Griqua establish themselves in Griqualand East, but then saw a proud community crumble in the face of colonial rule. He is perhaps best known today for <span class="italic">The Early Annals of Kokstad and Griqualand East</span> (1902). Written in his old age, when he was more critical of the Griqua than he had been in the 1870s, his book does not give them sufficient credit for reconstituting their state in a new environment, nor does it sufficiently recognize the adverse consequences for them of the advent of colonialism in the 1870s. His readable account nevertheless remains a valuable source for the early history of the Griqua settlement east of the Drakensberg mountains.<br>
