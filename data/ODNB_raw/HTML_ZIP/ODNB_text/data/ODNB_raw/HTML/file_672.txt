<span class="headword">Young family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1700&#150;1799), <span class="occ">musicians</span>, included two London organists and two generations of professional female singers. In August 1758 Mrs Delany wrote: &#145;the race of Youngs are <i>born</i> songsters and musicians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.503). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30253/', "Anthony Young (bap. 1683, d. 1747)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30283/', "Young, William (d. 1662)")</script>] was a boy chorister at the Chapel Royal and became organist of St Clement Danes in 1707. He contributed songs to the <span class="italic">Monthly Mask of Vocal Music</span> between 1705 and 1709 and published <span class="italic">A Collection of New Songs</span> (1707) and <span class="italic">Suits of Lessons for the Harpsicord or Spinnet</span> (1719). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74841/', "Charles Young (bap. 1686, d. 1758)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30283/', "Young, William")</script>], his brother, was a music teacher, organist of All Hallows Barking from August 1713; Charles's daughters were the singers <a href="#cosubject_672">Cecilia</a>, <a href="#cosubject_65896">Isabella</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_65898">Esther [<i>see below</i>]</a> and his son Charles (<i>d</i>. 1754), a senior clerk in the Treasury, was the father of a second generation of singers, <a href="#cosubject_65900">Isabella</a>, <a href="#cosubject_65902">Elizabeth</a>, and <a href="#cosubject_61855">Mary [<i>see below</i>]</a>. After the younger Charles's death the education of the three girls was taken over by their aunt Cecilia and her husband, the composer Thomas Augustine Arne. The family later believed that Anthony Young, the father of the organists Anthony and Charles, was the composer of the tune of Britain's national anthem.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_672"></a><span class="headword">Cecilia Young <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Arne]</span></span>  (1712&#150;1789), <span class="occ">singer</span>, daughter of the elder Charles Young and his wife, Elizabeth, was baptized at St Andrew's Church, Holborn, on 7 February 1712. At a concert for her benefit at Drury Lane Theatre on 4 March 1730 she was advertised as &#145;a Scholar of Signor GEMINIANI, who never yet sung in publick&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 4 March 1730). That October she appeared in concerts at Bath, where John, first Viscount Perceval, recorded in his diary that her voice was better than any Italian's he had heard &#145;in clearness, loudness and high compass&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 1.105). Her operatic d&eacute;but was in the title role of John Frederick Lampe's <span class="italic">Britannia</span> at the Haymarket Theatre in November 1732, and she sang the heroines in his <span class="italic">Amelia</span> on 18 December 1732 and <span class="italic">Dione</span> on 23 February 1733. She was engaged for the title role in Willem De Fesch's oratorio <span class="italic">Judith</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields on 9 February 1733, but was replaced by Miss Chambers in a delayed premi&egrave;re; the furious composer blamed the postponement on the &#145;Mis-Conduct and pretended Sickness of Cecilia Young&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 16 Feb 1733). Handel chose her for the first performance of his <span class="italic">Deborah</span> (17 March 1733) and she later sang in the premi&egrave;res of his <span class="italic">Ariodante</span> and <span class="italic">Alcina</span> (both 1735), <span class="italic">Alexander's Feast</span> (1736), and <span class="italic">Saul</span> (1739).<br>
<br>Against her father's wishes Cecilia married the Roman Catholic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/674/', "Thomas Augustine Arne (1710&#150;1778)")</script> on 15 March 1737 and converted to Catholicism. Arne wrote delightful music for her in his <span class="italic">Comus</span> (first performed 4 March 1738), including the perennially popular &#145;Sweet Echo&#146;, in <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, performed before Frederick, prince of Wales, at Cliveden in 1740, and in <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span> (1742), in which she was Venus. The Arnes went to Dublin in June 1742 and joined Arne's sister, the actress and singer Susanna Cibber, in benefit concerts. They were in Dublin for the 1742&#150;4 theatre seasons; Cecilia appeared in her husband's stage works and in concerts, although she was ill in October 1742 and again in May 1743, when her physician forbade her to perform &#145;at the Hazard of her Life&#146;  (Greene and Clark, 352). By this time their marriage was under strain: Arne was unfaithful (an illegitimate son, Michael, was born about 1740) and James Pilkington, Arne's apprentice in Dublin, claimed that Mrs Arne was &#145;prodigiously fond of Gin&#146; and that he had seen her &#145;toying on the Bed&#146; with the tenor Thomas Lowe  (Pilkington, 2.256&#150;9). In his draft will of 1770 Arne denied that Cecilia had ever been unfaithful to him, but stated that her &#145;violent and raging passions&#146; rendered her of no use to him or herself as a public singer. Charles Burney, Arne's apprentice from 1744 to 1746, always remembered Mrs Arne's goodness of heart and parental attention to his welfare and believed he had helped to preserve domestic harmony while he lived with them. Although Cecilia sang at Drury Lane and Vauxhall during those two years, she made very few appearances thereafter. In 1748 she went to Dublin without Arne for a season there with her sister and brother-in-law Isabella and John Frederick Lampe.<br>
<br>In autumn 1755 the Arnes returned to Dublin accompanied by Cecilia's young nieces Elizabeth and Mary (Polly) and Arne's pupil Charlotte Brent. Cecilia was ill at first, but then sang in several of Arne's pieces before the marriage broke down completely. Arne went back to London in 1756 with Charlotte Brent (by then almost certainly his mistress) and Elizabeth, abandoning Cecilia in Dublin with the six-year-old Mary. In 1758 Mrs Delany encountered her, &#145;an object of compassion&#146;, teaching singing in the household of a charitable family  (<span class="italic">Autobiography &hellip; Mrs Delany</span>, 3.502). Cecilia was heard in a few concerts in Dublin, but did not resume her singing career after returning to London with Mary in 1762. The Mrs Arne who sang in London between 1766 and 1769 was Michael Arne's wife, Elizabeth. Cecilia lived with Mary and her husband, Fran&ccedil;ois Hippolyte Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon, and performed at their benefit concert in 1774, advertised as &#145;the 1st Time of her singing in public these 20 Years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 16 May 1774). She received an annual allowance of &pound;40 from Arne, rather grudgingly paid. Mrs Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon collected the allowance, taking her daughter Cecilia Maria with her, and it was Arne's fondness for the child which reunited him with his wife for a few months before his death in March 1778. Cecilia remained a pious Catholic until her death at the Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mons' home on 6 October 1789.<br>
<br>Cecilia's sister <a name="cosubject_65896"></a><span class="headword">Isabella Young <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Lampe]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1716?, <em>d.</em> 1795), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was probably the Isabella baptized as the daughter of John and Elizabeth Young at St Lawrence Jewry on 3 January 1716. She sang at Drury Lane in the 1733&#150;4 season, making her stage d&eacute;but as Amphitrite in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 26 Nov 1733). She appeared in concerts before joining the Covent Garden company in the role of Margery, the heroine of John Frederick Lampe's burlesque opera <span class="italic">The Dragon of Wantley</span> on 26 October 1737. The opera, with its delightfully inane libretto by Henry Carey, proved hugely successful and was performed night after night, including 31 January 1738, the day of Isabella's marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15954/', "John Frederick Lampe (1702/3&#150;1751)")</script>. In the sequel, <span class="italic">Margery, or, A Worse Plague than the Dragon</span> (9 December 1738), the heroine falls prey to jealousy, but there is no evidence that the Lampes' marriage was other than happy. They worked together and Isabella took the female lead in all her husband's later stage pieces, among them <span class="italic">The Parting Lovers</span> (1739) and <span class="italic">Pyramus and Thisbe</span> (1745). For the two seasons 1748&#150;50 the Lampes were engaged by Thomas Sheridan at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, and they then moved to Edinburgh. Their arrival was delayed because Isabella had been seriously ill with a fever in Dublin, but it was Lampe who died from fever on 25 July 1751 in Edinburgh, where he had been &#145;settled very much to the satisfaction of the patrons of Music in that city, and of himself&#146;  (Burney, 4.672). Isabella returned to London and Covent Garden, and performed there every season until 1776, although her appearances grew less frequent in the later years. Her son, Charles John Frederick Lampe (<i>d</i>. 1767), succeeded his grandfather as organist at All Hallows Barking in 1758, and his wife, Ann, sang at the pleasure gardens and Sadler's Wells in the 1760s. Isabella lived with her sister Esther, whom she cared for tenderly during a long illness. She died on 5 January 1795.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_65898"></a><span class="headword">Esther Young <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Jones]</span></span>  (1717&#150;1795), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 14 February 1717. She joined her sisters in a benefit concert for their father at Mercers' Hall on 11 February 1736, sang with Isabella in Arne's <span class="italic">Grand Epithalamium</span> at Drury Lane that April, and made her Covent Garden d&eacute;but as the heroine's rival, Mauxalinda, in Lampe's <span class="italic">The Dragon of Wantley</span> in October 1737. She performed in almost every season at Covent Garden until she and her sister Isabella retired in 1776, taking numerous roles in musical afterpieces and pantomimes; she was the company's Lucy in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> from 1746 to 1761. In Handel's oratorio season in 1744 Esther created the contralto roles of Juno and Ino in <span class="italic">Semele</span>. On 8 April 1762 she married Charles Jones, a music-seller, horn player, and flautist, who on his death on 17 March 1780 left everything to his loving wife. She had been seriously ill for some years by December 1785, when the tenor John Beard wrote to the Royal Society of Musicians in support of a pension for her, describing her blameless and amiable character. She survived her sister Isabella by a few months and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 6 June 1795.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_65900"></a><span class="headword">Isabella Young <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Scott]</span></span>  (1740/41?&#150;1791), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was the daughter of Charles Young, the Treasury clerk. A pupil of the bass Gustavus Waltz, she made her first appearance singing with him at a concert for her benefit at the Haymarket Theatre on 18 March 1751. The following year at her benefit she sang and played &#145;one of Mr. Handel's Organ Concertos&#146;  (<span class="italic">General Advertiser</span>, 2 March 1752). Her father died in January 1754, and that spring she appeared in Arne's <span class="italic">Alfred</span>, described in the <span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span> as a thirteen-year-old pupil of Arne, and in his <span class="italic">Rosamond</span> and <span class="italic">Eliza</span>. She joined the Drury Lane company to take the part of Titania in the premi&egrave;re of John Christopher Smith's opera <span class="italic">The Fairies</span> on 3 February 1755 and the following February sang Ariel in Smith's opera <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. She appeared at Drury Lane frequently until 1777 as an entr'acte singer, in musical afterpieces, and in singing roles, such as Ariel in Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>. Handel employed her as his mezzo-soprano soloist in the last five oratorio seasons before his death in 1759 and she performed in <span class="italic">Messiah</span> at the Foundling Hospital on several occasions. She sang at Ranelagh and, being in demand at provincial festivals, at Oxford, Cambridge, Winchester, and Leicester and at the Three Choirs meetings from 1763 to 1765. The <span class="italic">Oxford Journal</span> of 12 April 1766 reported indignantly that she had not been engaged for Handel's <span class="italic">L'allegro</span> because she required &#145;Two and Forty Guineas, for one Night's Attendance&#146;.<br>
<br>On 12 December 1757 Isabella married the Hon. John Scott, younger brother of Henry Scott, fourth earl of Deloraine. She continued to appear on stage as Miss Young until 1769, although she sang as Mrs Scott in oratorios. Her only son, John Scott (baptized on 23 November 1758), became a midshipman in the Royal Navy and was killed in action against the Americans on 9 October 1776. She retired from singing at the end of the 1776&#150;7 season and died at her house in Kennington Lane, Vauxhall, on 17 August 1791. Her husband had died at his chambers in Gray's Inn on 31 December 1788 and in her will she left an annuity to her sister Mary Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon and the bulk of her estate to Mary's daughter Cecilia Maria.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_65902"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Young <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Dorman]</span></span>  (1741?&#150;1773), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was the daughter of Charles Young and was probably younger than her sister Isabella, who began her singing career earlier. Elizabeth was said to be over twenty-one on her marriage in 1762. She went with the Arnes and her young sister Mary to Dublin in autumn 1755 and took minor roles in the season of Arne operas at the Smock Alley Theatre. She seems to have returned to London with Arne in 1756 and that December sang in his <span class="italic">Eliza</span> as First Shepherdess. In a charity benefit performance of <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> at Drury Lane in June 1758 she played Lucy, her first speaking role, billed as &#145;the first Time of her appearing on any Stage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span>, 22 June 1758). She was a member of the Drury Lane company from autumn 1758, appearing as Mrs Dorman after her marriage to the violinist Ridley Dorman on 9 October 1762. In February 1764 George Rush's opera <span class="italic">The Royal Shepherd</span> was premi&egrave;red with Thomas Norris, a falsetto alto, as Agenor. He was badly received and on the second night &#145;Mrs Dormond perform'd in his room, much applauded&#146;  (<span class="italic">London Stage</span>, pt 4, 1042). She created the old maidservant Ursula in Charles Dibdin's highly successful comic opera <span class="italic">The Padlock</span> (3 October 1768) and sang the role well over a hundred times; her last stage appearances were in June 1772. She died in the parish of St Anne's, Soho, on 12 April 1773 and was buried on 19 April at St Paul's, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_61855"></a><span class="headword">Mary <span class="st"> [Polly, Maria]</span> Young <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon]</span></span>  (1749&#150;1799), <span class="occ">singer and composer</span>, was born on 7 July 1749 and baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 23 July 1749, the daughter of Charles and Mary Young. On 29 November 1755 at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, &#145;Miss Polly Young, a Child of Six Years of Age, pleased and astonished the whole Company, having a sweet melodious Voice, accenting her Words with great Propriety, and Singing perfectly in Time and Tune&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>, 2 Dec 1755). This was in Thomas Arne's <span class="italic">Eliza</span>, and she later sang in his <span class="italic">Rosamond</span> and <span class="italic">Alfred</span>. When the Arnes parted, Polly, as Mary was known as a child, remained with her aunt Cecilia in Dublin, and her earnings then and later contributed to Cecilia's support. She sang in concerts, at the theatre, and in the pleasure gardens in Dublin for another six years, before returning with her aunt to London. On 30 September 1762 she made her d&eacute;but at Covent Garden, when the <span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span> commented on the agreeable innocence of her appearance and found her playing on the harpsichord equal to her excellent singing. She remained at Covent Garden as an entr'acte and chorus singer until summer 1764 and then performed with the Italian opera company at the King's Theatre for three seasons. On 10 December 1766, at the age of seventeen, she married the leader of the opera orchestra, the violinist and composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1575/', "Fran&#231;ois Hippolyte Barth&#233;l&#233;mon (1741&#150;1808)")</script>. She appeared with Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon in concerts and oratorios, at Marylebone Gardens (1770, 1773), in a further Italian opera season (1770&#150;71), and in Dublin (1771&#150;2), where Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon presided over concert seasons at the Rotunda. They made a successful tour of Germany, France, and Italy in 1776&#150;7; Mrs Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon sang in her husband's oratorio <span class="italic">Jefte</span> at Florence and Rome and in Italian opera at Leghorn. Their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61854/', "Cecilia Maria Barth&#233;l&#233;mon (1767&#150;1859)")</script>, who performed with her parents at the royal courts of Naples and France, later claimed that her mother refused Marie-Antoinette's offer of a court appointment because of her desire to return to England and her aunt Cecilia.<br>
<br>Maria Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon, as she now called herself, performed in 1780&#150;82 at the Italian Opera in London. The Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mons continued to give concerts together and in 1784 had another summer season at the Dublin Rotunda. On 2 November 1784 a letter from Mrs Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon appeared in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> complaining that, despite her unblemished reputation and the honours she had received in continental courts, she was not engaged by the London managers because they were swayed by influence rather than merit. During Haydn's visits to London in the 1790s the composer became friendly with Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon and visited the family at its house in Kennington Place, Vauxhall. Cecilia Maria remembered singing Handel duets with her mother to Haydn's accompaniment. Between 1776 and 1795 Maria Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mon published a number of her own compositions, including six sonatas for keyboard and violin, a set of English and Italian songs, and a collection of hymns and anthems for the chapels of the Asylum for Female Orphans and the Magdalen Hospital. Their friendship with Jacob Duch&eacute;, the chaplain of the asylum, led to the Barth&eacute;l&eacute;mons' becoming Swedenborgians. Maria died at her home in Vauxhall on 20 September 1799 and was buried on 26 September 1799 at St Martin-in-the-Fields; her coffin was joined to that of her aunt Cecilia by a chain.<br>
