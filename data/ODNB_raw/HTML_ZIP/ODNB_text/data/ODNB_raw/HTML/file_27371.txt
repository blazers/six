<span class="headword">Thoroton,  Robert</span>  (1623&#150;1678), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 4 October 1623 at Morin Hall, Car Colston, Nottinghamshire, the eldest son of Robert Thoroton (1601&#150;1673) and his wife, Anne Chambers of Stapleford (married in St Mary's, Nottingham). His ancestors had long been small landowners in Nottinghamshire and the family owed its name to the hamlet and chapelry of Thoroton, formerly Thurveton, near Newark. Thoroton entered Christ's College, Cambridge, as a sizar, in 1639, graduating BA in 1642&#150;3 and MA in 1646. He married on 27 October 1645, probably at Nottingham, Anne, daughter of Gilbert Boun, serjeant-at-law, recorder of Newark, and MP, raising three daughters. In 1646 he was licensed by the university to practise medicine.<br>
<br>Thoroton settled at Car Colston where he combined medical practice with the occupations of a country gentleman, and although, on his own authority, he met with competent success as a physician, he acknowledged that he was unable &#145;to keep people alive for any length of time&#146;. Consequently, he:<blockquote>charitably attempted, notwithstanding the Difficulty and almost contrariety of the Study, to practice upon the dead, intending thereby to keep all which is or can be left of them, to wit the Shadow of their Names, (better than precious Ointment for the Body,) to preserve their memory, as long as may be in the World. (Thoroton, <span class="italic">Antiquities of Nottinghamshire</span>, preface)</blockquote>Although a staunch royalist, Thoroton apparently took little part in the civil war. He seems to have been among those &#145;gentry of the county&#146; of whom Clarendon said the garrison of Newark, besides its inhabitants, mainly consisted. In writing later of that town, Thoroton referred to the second siege, where in 1644 he saw troops under Prince Rupert relieve the town.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Thoroton became a justice of the peace for his county, and a commissioner of royal aid and subsidy. In the former office, together with his fellow justice and friend Penistone Whalley, he rendered himself notorious by stringent enforcement of the laws concerning conventicles against the Quakers. This retaliation for the imprisonments and confiscations suffered by his relatives and friends during the Commonwealth called forth some abusive pamphlets. He also rebuilt Morin Hall, Car Colston, now the Old Hall, illustrated by the Leicester topographer John Throsby (1740&#150;1803).<br>
<br>Thoroton commenced his <span class="italic">Antiquities of Nottinghamshire</span> in 1667. He first worked on some transcript notes which his father-in-law Gilbert Boun had made from <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. He assisted Sir William Dugdale in his <span class="italic">Visitation of Nottinghamshire, 1662&#150;1664</span>. For his researches he employed paid assistants at considerable expense to himself, delving into family archives, registers (some now lost), estate papers, church monuments, and epitaphs. Like a number of county antiquaries he was little concerned with his own times, or indeed with his own century, but tried to trace the manorial history of each parish back to <span class="roman">Domesday</span>. He showed little interest in Roman remains, while protesting at enclosure and destruction of woods. His notes, made on the back of letters from his patients in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, and Derbyshire, are now in Nottingham Public Library.<br>
<br>The folio volume of Thoroton's <span class="italic">Antiquities</span> was printed in London in 1677, illustrated with engravings by Hollar after Richard Hall and dedicated to Gilbert Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury, and Dugdale, both personal friends. Dugdale wrote to the antiquary Sir Daniel Fleming, &#145;Dr Thoroton's book cost me 16s to 18s. I do esteem the book well worth your buying, though had he gone to the fountain of records it might have been better done&#146;  (1 Sept 1677, <span class="italic">Le Fleming MSS</span>, 139&#150;40). John Throsby published a reprint of <span class="italic">Antiquities</span> with additions, in three volumes (published 1790&#150;96 but dated 1797).<br>
<br>Thoroton erected in 1664 a memorial outside the south aisle of Car Colston church recording the names of his ancestors, which survives at the time of writing, and in 1672 he designed for himself an imposing coffin of carved Mansfield stone. In 1673 Thoroton presented an alms dish to the church, while his wife, Anne, presented a silver flagon engraved with her arms. Thoroton died at Car Colston on 21 November 1678 and on 23 November was buried in the coffin, where his remains rested until 1842. The level of the churchyard by the church door was then lowered, and after re-burial of its contents, the coffin was brought into the church. Thoroton's wife survived him. He left his property to his daughter Anne Sherard, having earlier helped his younger brother to buy Screveton Hall estate, which remained in the family. The Thoroton Society, Nottinghamshire's local history society, is named after him. Sir Frank Stenton said of him:<blockquote>It is perhaps the greatest merit of Thoroton's work that he fully grasped the essential fact that the key to all manorial history lies in the distribution of land recorded in <span class="roman">Domesday</span>, and &hellip; as far as the work of identification is concerned, independent investigation can often do little more than confirm his minuteness and accuracy. (<span class="italic">VCH Nottinghamshire</span>, 1.246)</blockquote>
