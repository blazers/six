<span class="headword">Bishop,  Samuel</span>  (1731&#150;1795), <span class="occ">headmaster and poet</span>, was born in St John Street, London, on 21 September 1731, the eldest son of George Bishop, who came from Hollway, near Cattistock, in Dorset, and Mary, daughter of Samuel Palmer of Southover, near Lewes, in Sussex. He was entered at Merchant Taylors' School, London, on 6 June 1743, where he was a keen and able student. In June 1750 he was elected to St John's College, Oxford, and matriculated in July. Educated under Dr Thomas Fry he was elected a fellow of his college in June 1753, and in the following April he graduated BA. Not long afterwards he was ordained curate of Headley in Surrey, and he lived either in that village or at Oxford until 1758, when he took his MA degree.<br>
<br>On 26 July 1758 Bishop was appointed third under-master of his old school. He served as curate of St Mary Abchurch and then as lecturer of St Christopher-le-Stocks, both in London; he was also chaplain to John Warren, bishop of Bangor. In 1763, at St Augustine with St Faith, Watling Street, he married one of his mother's relatives, Mary, daughter of Joseph Palmer of Old Malling, near Lewes, and they settled in Scots Yard, Bush Lane, London. He rose to the second under-mastership on 11 February 1772, the first under-mastership on 12 August 1778, and was elected headmaster on 22 January 1783. He and his wife and daughter Mary (<i>bap</i>. 1763) moved to Suffolk Lane, next to the school, and he also took a house in Golders Green for the sake of his deteriorating health. He was presented to the rectory of Ditton in Kent, and on 1 March 1789 was rewarded for his long service to the school with the living of St Martin Outwich in London.<br>
<br>Opinions varied on Bishop's success as headmaster. Eulogized by one pupil, Harry Bristow Wilson, in his history of the school, Bishop was portrayed as a mild, affectionate, and inspiring schoolmaster. His memorialist, Thomas Clare, wrote of his desire to avoid any unnecessary severity in maintaining discipline, but another pupil, Charles Matthews, described Bishop and his under-master, John Rose, as &#145;cruel tyrants&#146;  (Farr, 58&#150;9). Matthews related how the boys threatened rebellion following a particularly vicious bout of flogging by Rose, and thereby forced Bishop to end all flogging in the school. Bishop's pupils were certainly not afraid of ridiculing him, for Matthews recorded how a favourite sport was to shoot paper darts into his oversize powdered wig so that it resembled &#145;a fretful porcupine&#146;  (Draper, 112). Bishop, however, was a diligent headmaster and devoted his holidays to school work.<br>
<br>Bishop was a prolific and able poet but published only some of his compositions during his lifetime; they included the anonymous &#145;Ode to the Earl of Lincoln on the Duke of Newcastle's Retirement&#146; (1762), said to have been prompted by the connection of Bishop's future wife's family with the duke, and a collection of Latin and English poems in the <span class="italic">Feriae poeticae</span> (1766). The majority of his poems were published after his death as <span class="italic">Poetical Works of the Rev. Samuel Bishop, A.M.</span> (2 vols., 1796), with a life of the author by Thomas Clare. A second edition was issued in 1800 and a third in 1802. His subjects are primarily domestic and familiar, and testify to a very contented marriage and home life. Southey said of Bishop that &#145;no other poet crowds so many syllables into a verse &hellip; His domestic poems breathe a Dutch spirit&#151;by which I mean a very amiable and happy feeling of domestic duties and enjoyments&#146;  (<span class="italic">Southey's Common-place Book</span>, 4.308&#150;9). He also wrote essays and poems for &#145;The Ladies Club&#146; in the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> and published a sermon on the anniversary of Henry Raine's charity.<br>
<br>Bishop died on 17 November 1795, worn out by physical suffering caused by gout and water on the chest; he was buried at St Martin Outwich. He was survived by his wife, who subsequently married Bishop's memorialist, the Revd Thomas Clare, later vicar of St Bride's, Fleet Street. A volume of Bishop's sermons on practical subjects appeared in 1798.<br>
