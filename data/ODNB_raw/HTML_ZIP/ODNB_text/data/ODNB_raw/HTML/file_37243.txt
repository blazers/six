<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Burdett,  Peter Perez</span>  (1734/5&#150;1793), <span class="occ">cartographer and draughtsman</span>, was probably born in Eastwood, Essex, the only son of William and Elizabeth Burdett. His Christian names derive from his maternal grandfather, Peter Perez, vicar of Eastwood (1697&#150;1748), from whom he inherited a small estate.<br>
<br>Of Burdett's first twenty-five years there is little record. By the early 1760s he lived in Derby and had launched a career as a cartographer. His map of Derbyshire at a scale of one inch to a mile, begun in 1763 and published in 1767, won him the &pound;100 premium offered by the Society of Arts. His many talents in the arts and sciences brought him a wide circle of acquaintances in Derbyshire, especially the painter Joseph Wright, in several of whose paintings he appears, notably in <span class="italic">A Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery</span> (1766) where Burdett is seen sketching. In 1765 Wright painted a fine portrait of Burdett and his first wife, Hannah, which hangs in the N&aacute;rodn&iacute; Galerie, Prague. Wright, who lent him money that he never repaid, continued to consult him on technical matters after he left Derby; Burdett in turn seems to have procured purchasers for some of Wright's pictures, including Washington Shirley, fifth Earl Ferrers, and Catherine the Great.<br>
<br>In 1768 Burdett moved to Liverpool and launched, in his impetuous way, several cartographic and artistic projects. His experiments with printmaking included aquatint, for which his claims to be the inventor are strong: he certainly published, in 1771, the first aquatint in England after a painting by his friend John Hamilton Mortimer, and, ever short of money and frequently in debt, sold the process to Paul Sandby, to whom it is usually credited, for &pound;40. His interest in transferring aquatinted designs to pottery led him in 1771 to approach Josiah Wedgwood, who after considerable interest finally lost patience with the headstrong Burdett, who had hopes of years of lucrative work from his process. Frederick the Great of Prussia and Benjamin Franklin, with whom he corresponded over several years, were equally discouraging; Franklin remarked that the colonies were not yet ready for Burdett. A fine draughtsman and noted expert in perspective, he was the first president of the Liverpool Society of Arts and exhibited in London at the Society of Artists. His ambitious but financially unprofitable venture with George Perry, ironmaster for the Coalbrookdale Company, to publish views of Liverpool by Michael Angelo Rooker, a map (1769), and a history of the town was completed after Burdett withdrew to chase more promising interests, but his drawings of public buildings, engraved by Edward Rooker, appeared in the history, published in 1773.<br>
<br>Burdett's plan to survey Lancashire failed for lack of sufficient subscribers. His map of Cheshire, begun in 1774, must have been completed by assistants, for early in 1775 he entered the service of the margrave of Baden, leaving a wife, whose subsequent fate is unknown, with his considerable debts. He was engaged to conduct the official survey of the margravate, reaching the rank of major. From the school of surveyors and mathematicians he founded grew the Karlsruhe Technical School. On 11 June 1787 Burdett married Friedericke Kottewski. Their daughter Anne married Count Friedrich Nostitz. Burdett died in Karlsruhe on 9 September 1793.<br>
