<span class="headword">Sparke,  Michael</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1586, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was the son of Richard Sparke, husbandman, of Eynsham, Oxfordshire. It seems likely that he had at least a grammar-school education since he could read and write Latin, and made a bequest to an Oxfordshire grammar school in his will. He was apprenticed on 7 June 1603 to the London bookseller Simon Pauley, but was transferred successively to two other stationers, the latter of whom, Bartholomew Downes, freed him on 10 June 1610.<br>
<br>Sparke later described himself as a &#145;wholesaleman&#146; and in 1652 claimed that he had &#145;dealt in <i>Books</i> above 40 yeares for my self&#146;  (Sparke, <span class="italic">Second Beacon</span>, 5). He may have spent some years as a journeyman since his first entry in the Stationers' Company register was in 1617; by his own account he had sold books through the countryside with Pauley and was well acquainted with provincial networks of chapmen, pedlars, and mercuries. From 1617 onwards he was dwelling and working at the sign of the Blue Bible in Green Arbour Court, London, near the Old Bailey. He sold books printed by the university printers at Oxford and Cambridge with whom he had a sustained working relationship. Sparke's brother Thomas and nephew Nathaniel were colonists in Virginia and Bermuda respectively, which may have inspired his interest in publishing works about colonization, including those of Captain John Smith and the first English edition of Mercator's <span class="italic">Atlas</span>. His will indicates that he also exported books to the American colonies.<br>
<br>In later life Sparke denounced Pauley as a papist who sold &#145;<i>Popish Books, Pictures, Beads</i>, and such <i>Trash</i>&#146; in the countryside  (Sparke, <span class="italic">Second Beacon</span>, 6). He also denounced a notorious papist bookbinder and other papists in the trade who had defrauded him. Indeed, Sparke's life and work were characterized by his maniacal devotion to the protestant religion. He later reminisced about visiting Leiden, probably about 1630, to line up books, especially bibles, for importation. In the 1620s he published <span class="italic">Crumms of Comfort</span>, a collection of prayers intended to serve as a daily prayer book, perhaps as an alternative to the official prayer book of the state church. Sparke's little volume proved immensely popular and went into forty-four editions through the early eighteenth century.<br>
<br>From 1626 Sparke was the dedicated publisher of the religious radical William Prynne and, according to Prynne, it was about this time that Sparke's troubles with church and crown regulatory authorities began. He was first in trouble in the aftermath of the parliament of 1626 for publishing Bishop Carleton's book refuting Richard Mountague. Following his arrest in April 1631 for publishing unlicensed books, Sparke was described as having been &#145;within 10 years past several times committed in prison and admonished, and although he promised to submit to his governors as other moderate men do, has as yet been more refractory and offensive than ever&#146;  (Rostenberg, 261). On a number of occasions Prynne and Sparke were in trouble together, notably at the appearance of <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> in 1633 for which both author and publisher were publicly pilloried, Sparke &#145;with a Paper in his Hat&#146;  (Jackson, 256). In addition, Sparke was fined &pound;500 by the Star Chamber and suspended from the livery of the Stationers' Company to which he had been admitted in December 1626. He also published the works of the Revd Henry Burton, another religious radical and associate of Prynne. Sparke was frequently in trouble for selling imported bibles to the detriment of the king's printer, and was still ranting about the monopoly over bibles in <span class="italic">Scintilla</span>, which he wrote and published in 1641. At other times he ran foul of the church, state, and Stationers' Company for printing unlicensed books. He was prosecuted also for having printed at Oxford books registered to other stationers in London.<br>
<br>From 1636 Sparke was in business with one of his sons, Michael, who was freed of the Stationers' Company on 1 March 1641, although their names continued also to appear separately in imprints and the son owned no copyrights. Not much is known of the son except that he died on 17 November 1645, &#145;Wounded by his unnaturall Brother [Philip] causelesly&#146; according to an acrostic ballad memorial  (Vere).<br>
<br>The convening of the Long Parliament in 1641 was something of a turning point for Sparke. His clients and friends, Prynne and Burton, were reprieved and hailed as heroes. Sparke's &pound;500 fine from the <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> case was remitted and he was granted a licence by the committee for printing to publish and republish Prynne's works. Sparke was also called on as an expert witness for the parliamentary government as, for example, in the trial of Archbishop William Laud: the publisher cuts a prominent figure in Hollar's engraving of the trial.<br>
<br>But as with many religious radicals of the period, Sparke became disillusioned with the Long Parliament and its godly revolution. He was also frustrated with his chosen trade. Between 1641 and 1645 he was a leader of a group of &#145;rebel Stationers&#146; who unsuccessfully sought reform in the governance of the company and in particular in the allocation of monopolies and the power the monopolists exercised within the trade. He continued to protest as an individual. In 1652 he upbraided stationers who would print and sell anything for profit, and who had no dedication to the protestant religion. He lamented that &#145;our Reformation is now a Desolation&#146; and that &#145;<i>Poor honest Stationers</i>&#146; could not pay their rents or feed their families  (Sparke, <span class="italic">Second Beacon</span>, 9).<br>
<br>Sparke died in December 1653 in Hampstead, Middlesex, and was buried on the 29th. He left a will indicative of his religious fervour and his moderate success in the book business. Sparke was married twice, and while he left a generous settlement to his second wife, Isabel, he requested to be buried in St Sepulchre's, Holborn, London next to his first wife, Elizabeth, who may have been connected to the Warwickshire gentry. To his &#145;good frend&#146; William Prynne, Sparke bequeathed his &#145;seale ring of gold&#146;. He specified that the livery of the Stationers' Company, along with all women save his daughters and grandchildren, should be excluded from his funeral, and further, that there should be no funeral sermon; his favoured devotional books rather than refreshments were to be distributed to those who attended.<br>
