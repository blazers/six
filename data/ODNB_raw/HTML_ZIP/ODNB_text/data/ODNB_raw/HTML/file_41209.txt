<span class="headword">Fitzmaurice,  Gerald Henry</span>  (1865&#150;1939), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 15 July 1865 in Howth, co. Dublin, the son of Henry Fitzmaurice, commercial agent, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McKenny. His father was a Kerryman from a minor branch of the much wealthier Petty-Fitzmaurice family. His mother came from a Howth family with interests in the public house and hotel business. Fitzmaurice was educated and trained for the priesthood at the French College on Dublin Bay, which was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, but for reasons that are unclear decided not to be a priest. Instead, in January 1888, he entered the open competition for the Levant consular service, passed fourth out of twenty-six candidates, and on 30 June was appointed a student interpreter at Constantinople.<h2>
<a name="Armeniamakingareputation"></a>Armenia: making a reputation</h2>Fitzmaurice was the star pupil of his intake at the Levant service training school at Ortak&ouml;y on the lower Bosphorus, and soon acquired a remarkable knowledge of colloquial Turkish. After graduating (first) and spending over a year in the dragomanate of the British embassy in Constantinople, his first provincial postings were in the eastern extremities of Asiatic Turkey. Now a political consul&#151;reporting on developments and trying to promote what would now be called &#145;good governance&#146;&#151;between 1891 and 1893 he covered for officers on leave at Van, Erzurum, and then Trebizond. In these posts Fitzmaurice, who remained a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life, observed with dismay the increasing troubles of the Armenian Christians. In October 1894 he returned to the embassy as acting third dragoman but was soon bored by the trivial tasks to which he was largely condemned. He was then given the post of vice-consul at the important consulate-general in Smyrna, of which from May until September 1895 he was in charge.<br>
<br>In the winter of 1895&#150;6 massacres of Armenians achieved such a scale that in certain towns, notably Birecik, some seemed to have converted to Islam in order to save their lives; here, too, the church had become a mosque. Attempting to deflect the anger of Europe, the sultan, Abdul Hamid II, in January 1896 invited the British ambassador to nominate someone to join a palace commission of inquiry, and Fitzmaurice was chosen. Such work was not for the faint-hearted, and some embassy colleagues felt that he was being sent to his &#145;certain death&#146;  (Hohler, 11). Nevertheless, he survived unscathed and his conclusions were not surprising: the conversions were obviously forced and a new commission should proceed to Birecik to establish the confidence that reconversions would require. Inevitably, he was chosen to join it.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice judged that the palace had inspired the Armenian massacres, and convinced many to this view who had hitherto given Abdul Hamid the benefit of the doubt. The obvious dangers of his second mission were not reduced when, on the eve of his departure in early June 1896, his descriptions of the massacres were included in a blue book laid before parliament. The embassy was alarmed and repeatedly pressed the palace to provide him with an adequate escort. By early July it was clear that the new commission had made remarkable progress. Fitzmaurice secretly persuaded the forced converts to declare themselves once more Christians, and the church in Birecik was returned to Christianity. Shortly afterwards his fellow commissioners reluctantly agreed to accompany him to the neighbouring villages and thence to Urfa, where the process of reconversion was repeated.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice was warmly praised for his efforts on the Birecik commission, which established his reputation both in the embassy and the Foreign Office as someone who had special insight into the workings of the Ottoman empire and could also deal successfully with its officials in the most difficult circumstances; his skill as a raconteur added to his popularity. In June 1897 he was made CMG. Though formally only third dragoman (he had been given the substantive rank in January), everyone regarded him as second, and in 1900 he would have been made chief dragoman had the incumbent, Adam Block, succeeded in his application for another post. There was mutual antipathy between Block and Fitzmaurice, for whom the drudgery of juniors' work in the dragomanate added to his unhappiness, and he now sought escape. Accordingly, Sir Nicholas O'Conor, who had been ambassador since 1898, soothed him with release to provincial posts for short periods and then with another special mission.<h2>
<a name="TheAdenYemenfrontier"></a>The Aden&#150;Yemen frontier</h2>There had periodically been friction along the vague frontier between the Ottoman <i>vilayet</i> of Yemen and the Aden protectorate (then part of British India), and by late 1902 the Anglo-Turkish commission appointed a year earlier to demarcate it had made no progress. At this dangerous point Fitzmaurice was sent to stiffen the commission's British component, his instructions from O'Conor being to produce peacefully a quick settlement that would nevertheless preserve the British position, that is perform a diplomatic miracle. In the event it was not until April 1905, largely as a result of Fitzmaurice's untiring efforts (aided by his rapidly improving Arabic) that the frontier was finally delimited. Unfortunately, in the process he had initially upset the peevish O'Conor by agreeing with the Indian government on the need for a credible threat of force; had nevertheless had furious rows with the politically unsubtle Aden resident, General Maitland; and, living for the whole time under canvas until Perim Island was reached, had suffered from bouts of fever that permanently damaged his health. No one was pleased with the time taken and costs involved in the Aden affair. In consequence, though on returning to London on long leave in July 1905 Fitzmaurice found that he had been made CB, he did not get the Indian honour to which he also believed himself entitled. Worse still, he had been passed over for chief dragoman on Block's departure in 1903; O'Conor could not afford to release him from the Aden frontier at that juncture and had not been straight with him about it. He was still third dragoman, and at the beginning of 1906 returned to his &#145;Byzantine dungheap&#146; nourishing a burning hatred of his chief.<h2>
<a name="Chiefdragomanatlast"></a>Chief dragoman at last</h2>In August 1905 Fitzmaurice had been given the paltry consolation of a consular commission, and in July 1906 he finally became <i>de jure</i> as well as <i>de facto</i> second dragoman when Hugo Marinitch retired. It was, however, in the position of tutor and friend to the embassy's younger secretaries and honorary attach&eacute;s, among them Percy Loraine, Mark Sykes, Aubrey Herbert, and above all George Lloyd, that Fitzmaurice&#151;who never married&#151;found more valuable consolations. By now in his early forties, he was short in build but had a large head and a strong, bony face with a hooked nose, deep-set blue eyes, and a fashionably drooping moustache. Perhaps his most striking feature, however, was his red hair. In his native Ireland this would have been called foxy and it is probably in part for this reason, in part because of the reputation for stealth and cunning of the fox (in Turkish <i>tilki</i>), that Fitzmaurice always referred to the private fraternity and outlook he shared with his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;s as &#145;tilkidom&#146;. They were his <i>yavri tilkis</i> (young foxes); Fitzmaurice was the <i>bash tilki</i> (chief fox).<br>
<br>In October 1907 O'Conor finally made Fitzmaurice chief dragoman, and in the following May he was given the local rank of first secretary in the diplomatic service. This inaugurated the long period in which he dominated the outlook of the British embassy in Constantinople, the more so because the ambassador died in the following March and Sir Gerard Lowther, who arrived to replace him shortly after the Young Turks' revolution in July 1908, proved a particularly good pupil.<h2>
<a name="Oldregimethoughnotreactionary"></a>Old regime though not reactionary</h2>Like the Foreign Office, Fitzmaurice welcomed the eclipse of Abdul Hamid and the German influence linked to him, but it was not long before he was adopting a critical tone towards the Young Turks' Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). The &#145;children&#146;, as he routinely called them in his private letters, were too chauvinistic, too clumsy, and too secretive in their style of government. Controlled, he believed, by freemasons and Russophobic Jews, they were in the process of throwing out the Old Turks' baby (including the caliphate) with the Hamidian bathwater. Older, wiser, and more moderate heads were needed to lead the revolution and Britain should not commit itself too closely to the CUP.<br>
<br>Lowther was easily persuaded to Fitzmaurice's view and when the committee ousted the veteran, pro-English grand vizier, Kiamil Pasha, the embassy gave discreet encouragement to the counter-revolution of April 1909. This failed and Fitzmaurice was accused by CUP supporters in London and Constantinople of being not just a reactionary schemer but one whose poor judgement had thrown away the great opportunity to replace German with British influence in Turkey. In reply he denied that the embassy had taken sides, maintaining in any case that he was just old regime rather than reactionary, though the subtlety of this distinction was lost on most of his hearers. As to encouraging Germany's comeback, this was exaggerated: recent events had simply brought to the surface the strong German leaven in the army.<br>
<br>With the stout support of Lowther and influential friends like William Tyrrell and George Lloyd, Fitzmaurice weathered this crisis, though from now on he was a marked man as far the CUP was concerned. This was obvious in London and the foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey, began to think that perhaps he was becoming more of a liability than an asset. It was as well, therefore, that he was permitted to start a long leave in June 1911 and then sent on another special mission.<h2>
<a name="TroubleshootinginTripoli"></a>Troubleshooting in Tripoli</h2>Early in December 1911 Fitzmaurice was sent as acting consul-general to the Ottoman <i>vilayet</i> of Tripoli, which had been invaded by Italy in September and where the anti-Italian attitude of the consul-general, Justin Alvarez, was causing embarrassment to the Foreign Office. Britain could not condone Italy's unashamed land-grab, but at the same time did not wish to cement its participation in the triple alliance by seeming to condemn it. Fitzmaurice's task was difficult because Alvarez was his senior in the Levant service and they were old acquaintances; it was some time, therefore, before he could be persuaded to go. Meanwhile Fitzmaurice smoothed things over with the Italians, while sending the Foreign Office some sardonic despatches on their slow military progress. He returned to Constantinople in July 1912, only to be confronted in October with the outbreak of the First Balkan War.<h2>
<a name="RetreatfromConstantinople"></a>Retreat from Constantinople</h2>Fitzmaurice, who was an admirer of the Bulgarians and hoped to see Turkey driven out of Europe altogether, relished the initial victories of the Balkan League and in early November expected to have to accompany the Turkish government in fleeing Constantinople before its advancing armies. Instead the Turks managed to hold out on the Chatalja lines and he found himself instead successfully facilitating the direct talks between Turkey and the Balkan League that he hoped would ratify the new balance of power. This was his last major contribution to Ottoman affairs because in January 1913 a particularly ruthless version of CUP government came to power and a discreet campaign for his recall began. Moreover in the summer Lowther was recalled, and in October replaced by Sir Louis Mallet, who was more sympathetic to the German as well as CUP point of view. Though at first Mallet found Fitzmaurice indispensable, by February 1914 a combination of CUP pressure and worsening health finally forced his retreat from Constantinople, to which he never returned.<h2>
<a name="Politicalwarfare"></a>Political warfare</h2>With the outbreak of war between Britain and Germany, which Fitzmaurice had always predicted, and Turkey's decision for the central powers, which he had always feared, Fitzmaurice's stock in London had recovered&#151;and with it his health. He was now employed on the work for which he had special talent, political warfare.<br>
<br>Fitzmaurice was an early supporter of the idea of an Arab revolt and in December 1914 supported Sir Henry McMahon in discussions on this in Paris. Early in the following year he was loaned to naval intelligence, whose director, Captain Reginald Hall, was an ardent admirer, and ordered to the Balkans with two fellow agents. Their task: to orchestrate the overthrow of the Turkish government and thus the peaceful passage of the Dardanelles by the Anglo-French fleet. At this point Lord Fisher, the first sea lord, believed Fitzmaurice to be &#145;the most important person in the Eastern Theatre of the War&#146;  (W. R. Hall's autobiography, CAC Cam.). Hall's scheme foundered on the promise of Constantinople to Russia and Churchill's misplaced belief in naval success, so the focus of Fitzmaurice's Balkan mission shifted. With the local rank of first secretary at the legation in Sofia, he was instructed by Grey either to enlist Bulgaria to the entente or at least keep it neutral. For this purpose Fitzmaurice, now living in real danger of assassination by German agents, was authorized to spend up to &pound;2.5 million. This was another hopeless task and at Lemnos in April Fitzmaurice failed to persuade the British commanders to postpone further operations at the Dardanelles until the Bulgarians could be brought in; it was clear that they wanted not cash bribes but firm guarantees of territory, in the competition to provide which Britain, to Fitzmaurice's disgust, could not compete with Germany. He left Sofia in October 1915, shortly before Britain declared war on Bulgaria.<br>
<br>In November 1915 the Foreign Office's loan of Fitzmaurice to naval intelligence was formalized but there remained a feeling in Whitehall that his talents were wasted in Admiralty Old Building and numerous schemes were devised to bring him back into action. For various reasons, however, he became a nearly man: nearly the negotiator in Switzerland of the formal abdication of the Egyptian khedive (1916); nearly a further recruit to the Arab Bureau in Cairo (later in 1916); nearly consul-general in Moscow following the Bolshevik revolution (1918); and nearly political adviser to General Bridges in Bulgaria (later in 1918). What he did do&#151;prompted not just by the <i>realpolitik</i> of the time but by a long-held attachment to secular Zionism&#151;was to help his old friend Sir Mark Sykes prepare the ground for the Balfour declaration of November 1917, and then to scupper the idea of a separate peace between Britain and Turkey.<br>
<br>At the time of the armistice between Britain and Turkey in October 1918 Fitzmaurice was still formally chief dragoman. However, the Turks had dropped a strong hint that it would be unfortunate if he returned to Constantinople, which probably confirmed a decision already taken. In 1919 he was transferred from the Admiralty to the Foreign Office's news and political intelligence department. In the following year this was being run down and neither of the other jobs offered to him was suitable. With his health impaired and anxious no longer to block the promotion of his friend, Andrew Ryan, the second dragoman, on 1 January 1921 he retired. He had received no further honours since 1905, though those ranking with him in the Levant service had either been knighted already or would be before long. He was only fifty-five years old.<br>
<br>In retirement Fitzmaurice remained discreet about his career and refused to write his memoirs. He devoted much time to working for boys' clubs and seamen's homes in the East End of London, living in &#145;cheerless private hotels&#146;  (Bullard, 64), though finding warm friendship and a good audience for his stories on Sunday afternoons in the Pimlico home of the Irish Nationalist MP John Pius Boland. He died as the result of cerebral thrombosis and arteriosclerosis at 29 Devonshire Street, Marylebone, London, on 23 March 1939 and was buried at Kensal Green.<br>
<br>Gerald Fitzmaurice was a classic example of what Wicquefort called a &#145;minister of the second order&#146;, a man who did the kind of thing with which ambassadors could not risk personal involvement. Fitzmaurice had unconquerable fear neither of political nor physical risk, and had strong political views (he was an ardent believer in tariff reform and saw no tension between moderate Irish nationalism and British imperialism). The result was that the British embassy in Turkey, weakly led for most of his time and used too much as a training school for the diplomatic aristocracy, had good reason to be grateful to him. So, too, did many British companies, not to mention, of course, thousands of Armenians and, ironically enough, Jews&#151;and even many Turks. Naturally he was guilty of misjudgements, and seems to have come to believe too much in his own propaganda about the conspiracy of Jewish freemasons behind the Young Turks. Nevertheless, he remained, as was often said of him, a remarkable man: clear-headed, ruthless, persuasive, and full of energy, a Lenin of diplomacy. The &eacute;lite Levant service produced numerous outstanding men. Fitzmaurice of Constantinople, as it came to know him, or the Wizard of Stamboul, as he sometimes jokingly described himself, was probably the greatest.<br>
