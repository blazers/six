<span class="headword">Dorion, Sir  Antoine-Aim&eacute;</span>  (1818&#150;1891), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Canada</span>, was born on 17 January 1818 at St Anne-de-la-P&eacute;rade, Lower Canada, the second of the ten children of Pierre-Antoine Dorion, a merchant descended from Pierre Dorion, who had emigrated from the Basses-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es of France in 1684, and his wife, Genevi&egrave;ve Bureau. Antoine-Aim&eacute; was brought up in a liberal and nationalist home. His father sat in the assembly as a supporter of <i>patriote</i> causes: Louis-Joseph Papineau was a visitor to his home. Although his father later lost his fortune, Dorion, like his male peers in the Lower-Canadian bourgeoisie, received a classical education. After attending the S&eacute;minaire de Nicolet (1830&#150;37) he studied law under C&ocirc;me-S&eacute;raphin Cherrier (1838&#150;42), and was called to the bar in 1842. On 12 August 1848 in Montreal he married Iphig&eacute;nie, the daughter of Dr Jean-Baptiste Trestler, with whom he had one son and three daughters.<br>
<br>While politics were Dorion's first love he did practise law in Montreal with Cherrier and headed the Montreal bar in 1861&#150;2 and 1873&#150;5. Active in politics by the late 1840s, he was identified as a moderate Liberal among the opponents of the dominant conservatism of Louis-Hyppolyte LaFontaine and George-&Eacute;tienne Cartier. By the early 1850s he had succeeded Louis-Joseph Papineau and was leader of the <i>rouge</i> party. Dorion was always perceived as a moderate and played a prominent role in founding the <i>rouge</i> newspaper <span class="italic">Le Pays</span>. He favoured universal suffrage, free, universal education, and an end to the corruption endemic in Canadian politics. A strong defender of private property and trade reciprocity with the United States, he supported economic development through the construction of canals and railways. Much of Dorion's energies were devoted to the issue of anti-clericalism in his party and the role of the Roman Catholic church in politics. A practising Catholic and a moderate on the issue of church-held seigneurial lands, he eventually distanced himself from the increasingly anti-clerical Institut Canadien, of which his brother Jean-Baptiste-&Eacute;ric was a founder and president (1850&#150;51). In 1854 he was elected for Montreal in the legislative assembly, a victory he owed in large measure to English-speaking voters. His signing of the annexation manifesto (1849) calling for annexation to the United States had brought him contact with liberal members of the Anglophone community. Indeed, his ties with English-speaking liberals led to nationalist charges that he was not strong enough in his defence of the French language.<br>
<br>In August 1858 Dorion joined George Brown in a short-lived administration. After being defeated by George-&Eacute;tienne Cartier in the elections of 1861 he came back into the assembly in 1862 and became provincial secretary in the administration of John Sandfield Macdonald and Louis-Victor Sicotte. He remained in the cabinet less than a year, resigning over hostility to expansion of the Grand Trunk Railway. Although he was back in the government two months later, the government lasted less than a year, being defeated in March 1864. Dorion was not then a part of the &#145;Great Coalition&#146; which shepherded the union of British North America.<br>
<br>Although he had earlier supported the idea of a federation of Upper and Lower Canada, Dorion opposed the <span class="roman">Quebec Resolutions</span>, which he described as &#145;the most illiberal constitution ever heard of in any country where constitutional government prevails&#146;  (cited in Young, 81). He was particularly concerned with provincial autonomy and the future of the French-Canadian minority in the proposed confederation of British North America.<br>
<br>Dorion's brother Jean-Baptiste-&Eacute;ric Dorion (1826&#150;1866), the <i>enfant terrible</i> of Lower Canadian politics and editor of <span class="italic">L'Avenir</span>, was an even more outspoken opponent of confederation, fearing that, in the long term, it would destroy French Canada, and was much stronger in his nationalism and his opposition to seigneurial tenure. Although another brother, Abb&eacute; Hercule Dorion, was a missionary, Jean-Baptiste-&Eacute;ric was known for his passionate anti-clericalism.<br>
<br>In the post-confederation years, Antoine-Aim&eacute; Dorion played an important role in the transformation of the Liberal Party in Quebec into a moderate party acceptable to Catholic authorities. He also served as minister of justice of Canada for a short period (November 1873&#150;May 1874) in the government of Alexander Mackenzie and was appointed a knight bachelor in 1877. Happy to leave politics, he accepted nomination in 1874 as chief justice of the court of queen's bench for Quebec, a position he held until, following a stroke, he died, on 31 May 1891, at his home on Sherbrooke Street, Montreal.<br>
