<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Heywood,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>1496/7, <em>d.</em> in or after 1578), <span class="occ">playwright and epigrammatist</span>, is thought to be the son of William Heywood, a lawyer of Coventry who acted as a temporary coroner there in 1505&#150;6. His mother's name and family are not known, but his father's association with the Rastell family at Coventry was important later in John's life. It is known that John had three brothers: William (<i>d</i>. 1568), a yeoman of Stock in Essex, was his elder; and Richard (1509&#150;1570) entered Lincoln's Inn in 1534 and died prosperous, bearing arms. The third was Thomas, an Augustinian friar pensioned at the dissolution from St Osyth's monastery in Essex, who was arrested in April 1574 &#145;for saying masse&#146;; the long-standing suggestion that Thomas was executed on 14 June  (Reed) has subsequently been challenged on the grounds that a letter from the privy council (dated August 1574) lists the friar as still alive and apparently in prison  (Flynn).<br>
<br>Most of John Heywood's early years remain obscure, though Anthony Wood claims that he found his studies at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, rather uncongenial. He must in youth have acquired musical skills: one unsupported tradition holds that he was a chorister. The first positive references to him at the court of Henry VIII call him a singer: as such he was granted six quarterly payments of &pound;5 between Michaelmas 1519 and Christmas 1520, making an annual salary of &pound;20. By 1525, when the quarterly payment rose to &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., he was designated a &#145;player of the virginals&#146;, and this remained his denomination for many years afterwards in court documents. An annual pension of &pound;10 was set up in November 1528, and though the records are not continuous he received this at least until 1551. As the 1528 warrant indicates that he was &#145;discharged from the King's court&#146;, this pension probably marked a change of status, perhaps a release from regular employment. From then on it is apparent that his activities diversified considerably from the profession of musical performer; it is not clear that he had ever composed music, though some of his lyrics have survived.<br>
<br>By the time this pension was set up Heywood was approximately thirty, his family connections had developed considerably, and there are signs of prosperity and a social status which could hardly have resulted solely from his musical duties, whatever they may have comprised. When Sir Thomas More became a privy councillor in 1518 he already had a connection with Heywood, and the latter's initial steps at court may have stemmed from his patronage and growing influence in the early 1520s. In any case there was already a closer family tie, as John Rastell had married More's sister Elizabeth (probably before 1504), and Heywood himself married the Rastells' daughter Joan (<i>d</i>. before 1574) at some point before 1523. It was in that year that Heywood became a freeman of the city of London in the Stationers' Company, the common council having received a letter from the king in support. Meanwhile John Rastell had been gaining royal favour on his own behalf: a man of many parts, he had worked at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, and created a pageant in Cheapside for the visit of the emperor Charles V in 1522. This dramatic interest, together with his status as a stationer&#151;his activity in the printing business went back at least as far as 1512&#151;were doubtless of value to his son-in-law. Rastell built a house with a stage in Finsbury Fields in 1524, and at some point after 1526 he printed <span class="italic">Gentleness and Nobility</span>, a play of his own composition, which may have contained a contribution by Heywood. Most of what survives of Heywood's work as a dramatist apparently dates from the next few years.<br>
<br>The marriage of Joan Rastell and John Heywood produced at least four children. Both <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13180/', "Ellis Heywood (1529&#150;1578)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13182/', "Jasper Heywood (1535&#150;1598)")</script> had successful academic careers at Oxford before becoming Jesuit priests in exile. Jasper was especially distinguished in the field of drama, publishing translations of two plays by Seneca; Ellis was gifted in languages. Joan Heywood married Christopher Stubbe; John and his wife conveyed property in Tottenham to them in 1542, possibly as a marriage settlement. Elizabeth Heywood married John Donne, a successful London ironmonger, and gave birth to the poet John Donne (1572&#150;1631). Like their children John and Joan remained lifelong Catholics, and this loyalty played a large part in Heywood's subsequent fortunes, and in his literary output. He managed to survive political and religious turmoil in Tudor court circles, occasionally being paid for specific musical and dramatic entertainments, until he and his wife went into exile to Brabant in 1564. There are very few personal writings to indicate what Heywood felt about these changes, but it seems clear from subsequent events that the crisis of Henry VIII's heretical break with Rome over his divorce caused Heywood much concern, and that his personal loyalty to Princess Mary was publicly rewarded when she became queen. Through these years he must have been anxious over the fates of his immediate family: the imprisonment and execution of More, his wife's uncle (1535); the death of John Rastell, her father, imprisoned as a protestant heretic (1536); and the exile of her Catholic brother William Rastell (1508&#150;1565) in the reign of Edward VI. During this time Heywood acquired land and property in Middlesex, Essex, and Kent, and achieved a higher social status. In 1530 he became a common measurer of the Mercers' Company in the city of London. At new year 1533 he received a royal gift of a gilt cup.<br>
<br>Heywood's political and religious interests during the remainder of the reign of Henry VIII may be judged by two elements: his activities as a playwright up to 1534 and his indictment for treason in 1544. The canon and dating of the plays have been objects of much conjecture. Besides the possible contribution to <span class="italic">Gentleness and Nobility</span> six complete plays are attributed to him. Of these &#145;Witty and Witless&#146; remained in a manuscript, not in Heywood's hand, with his name at the end. <span class="italic">The Play of the Wether</span> (1533) and <span class="italic">A Play of Love</span> (1534) were both printed by William Rastell (son of John Rastell) and named Heywood on the title-page. <span class="italic">Four PP</span> was similarly named, but the first extant edition is by Thomas Middleton (<i>c</i>.1544). William Rastell also printed <span class="italic">Johan Johan</span> (a translation and adaptation of <span class="italic">La farce du past&eacute;</span>) and <span class="italic">The Pardoner and the Friar</span> in 1533, both anonymous. Dates of composition remain conjectural, and there is no positive evidence about if and when performances took place, though a stage direction in &#145;Witty&#146; mentions the expected presence of the king. There is little doubt that Heywood was actively engaged in performance later on, and the probability remains high that he was similarly involved in these years of tension surrounding the controversy over protestantism and the king's divorce.<br>
<br>The comic style of the plays, with their persistent interest in the clash of different points of view, has led to their being characterized as debates rather than as true drama, but recent criticism and performances have shown that there is much that is visual in them and that they frequently contain structures and situations which gain enormously by being physically enacted on a stage. The cunning blend of characters of different types, together with the versatile and resourceful dialogue are important features in performance. There is also a tendency to include extensive passages of dramatic narrative at key points in the plays, such as Vice's tale of the mocker mocked in <span class="italic">Love</span>, and these provide an opportunity for performance skills including movement and the imitation of dialogue by the narrators. Although the subject matter is often centred on apparently trivial comic topics like the appropriateness of the weather, or whether a witty or a witless man has more pleasure in life, there are underlying issues which come close to the heart of major contemporary controversy. Heywood avoids the morality play structure popular in many interludes, but consistently engages with his subject matter in such a way that Catholic doctrine is upheld. Though he is often satirical about some practices like the exploitation by pardoners (following Chaucer verbatim in some passages) his main objectives seem to be to see the world so as to vindicate his Catholic beliefs, albeit sustained and tempered by a humanism which probably goes back to Erasmus, via the early work and opinions of Sir Thomas More. In real life he was well known for his jesting and his witty inventiveness, as witnessed by his biographer Pitseus, even in the form of a deathbed quip; his treatment of doctrinally serious matters in the plays is always coloured by the same predisposition. Sometimes the jokes seem dangerously near the mark, as when the devil, attired for tennis in his shirt, seems to suggest the king himself in <span class="italic">Four PP</span>, but this boldness in invention may have been found allowable and indeed valuable in life at court and on stage.<br>
<br>While a purely allegorical interpretation of Heywood's work has not been found to be consistent, there are internal grounds for believing that the characterization of Jupiter in <span class="italic">Wether</span> is based upon Henry VIII, and when one considers the probable date of composition early in 1533, it seems that the argument about the weather may really be directed at the religious controversy surrounding Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn in January. As Jupiter is enjoined to judge the weather from his own authority, so Henry is covertly urged to rise above the factions surrounding him and leave religion where it was. From Heywood's viewpoint at this time the shift to protestantism was not necessarily inevitable. Perhaps the comic tone of this statement of Heywood's concern is also to be associated with an attempt to mollify the growing storm, for More had resigned the chancellorship and his opposition to change was now revealed in a series of trenchant polemics.<br>
<br>For the rest of the 1530s Cromwell was in power, and Heywood's objections were apparently muted, except for his loyalty to Princess Mary, to whom he wrote &#145;A Song in Praise of a Lady&#146; (1534, printed in <span class="italic">Tottel's Songes and Sonnettes</span>, 1557). After Cromwell's fall in 1540, however, Heywood took a public step which might well have been disastrous. With John More he became involved in a conspiracy to discredit Cranmer. As a result he was attainted, lost a good deal of his property, and must for some time have been in mortal danger. He was pardoned, and had to make a public recantation at Paul's Cross on 6 July 1544 of what were now regarded as heretical views regarding the royal supremacy.<br>
<br>Perhaps as some kind of peace offering a few months later Heywood wrote a play for Cranmer, &#145;The Parts of Man&#146;, some lines of which are preserved in the autobiography of his pupil, Thomas Whythorne. Heywood was concerned with entertainments at court on a number of other occasions. Cromwell paid him for a &#145;Masque of King Arthur's Knights&#146;, which was performed twice in February 1539. For Princess Elizabeth he and Sebastian Westcott presented a play using the children of St Paul's in February 1552. In the following year his &#145;play of children&#146; had to be postponed from Shrovetide to Easter on account of the failing health of King Edward. In August 1559, after Elizabeth's accession, there was another performance of a play using children at Nonsuch, but by then, as will be seen, the political climate was beginning to turn against him.<br>
<br>Probably Heywood's best years were spent under Queen Mary. At her coronation in 1553 Stow records that Heywood was in St Paul's Churchyard where he &#145;sat in a pageant under a vine and made to her an oration in Latin and in English&#146;. In this same year he received a gift of &pound;50 from the queen. Some witty exchanges with Mary personally are recorded by William Camden and Ben Jonson. On her marriage to King Philip of Spain the following year he wrote a ballad beginning &#145;The eagle's bird hath spread his wings&#146; in celebration. In 1555 his pension was increased to &pound;50 per annum. Just before Mary's death this was cancelled and replaced by a grant of the manor of Bulmer, near Malton in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>A number of literary activities were now coming to fruition. Heywood's allegorical poem <span class="italic">The Spider and the Flie</span> was printed by Thomas Powell in 1556. Apparently it had been started some years before, and as Mary was a central figure in this political and religious fiction, Heywood must have judged that this was a good moment to finish it. He has an authorial presence in this poem, reflected in a number of pictures in the original text showing him observing events. The frontispiece provides us with a full-length portrait of him in academic address, showing that he was a tall man.<br>
<br>Apart from a handful of lyrics, Heywood was also hard at work on his proverbs and epigrams. Beginning with <span class="italic">A Dialogue Containing the Number in Effect of All the Proverbs in the English Tongue</span> in 1546, he built up a series of epigrams on proverbs in hundreds over editions in 1549, 1555, 1556, 1560, and 1561, culminating in his <span class="italic">Works</span> of 1562 (the plays were not included). Though perhaps not containing all the known English proverbs, the collection, estimated at over 1260, was indeed the largest to have appeared. It derived from many sources, including Erasmus's <span class="italic">Adages</span> (1508), but there is a sense that Heywood's sensitive ear for demotic speech played a significant part. The <span class="italic">Works</span> were well enough liked to be reprinted in 1566, 1576, 1587, and 1598.<br>
<br>At the beginning of Elizabeth's reign Heywood was prosperous and for a time he seems to have maintained some status in court entertainment, but the commission set up to enforce the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> against Catholics in 1564 precipitated a crisis for Heywood and his circle. He fled to Brabant on 20 July, leaving his interests in the care of his son-in-law, John Donne. Early in the 1570s commissions were set up enquiring into the possessions of exiles, and the transference of money must have been interrupted. Heywood, a widower, &#145;being now 78 years of age &hellip; a poor, honest, quiet old man&#146;, wrote to Burleigh from Mechelen on 18 April 1575 asking for help with the arrears  (Reed, 237&#150;8). Ellis Heywood had taken up a position at the English College in Antwerp, and John joined him there in 1576. The final crisis came two years later when the college was sacked. John and Ellis fled to Catholic Louvain, where Ellis died on 2 October 1578. John followed shortly afterwards, jesting to the last. His wit, which the protestant John Bale had acknowledged in his <span class="italic">Summarium</span> long before in 1548, was subsequently celebrated by Gabriel Harvey, William Webbe, George Puttenham, John Harington, Camden, and Jonson. His contribution to English comedy has proved to be inimitable.<br>
