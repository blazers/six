<span class="headword">Lemberg <span class="st"> [Limberg, Limburg]</span>,  Tideman</span>  (<em>c.</em>1310&#150;1386), <span class="occ">merchant and banker</span>, came of a family which had migrated to the Westphalian town of Dortmund, in north-west Germany, during the thirteenth century, and there joined the influential guild of shoemakers and tanners. Nothing is known of his youth and apprenticeship, but there is evidence for his taking an active part in the trade with England from 1339&#151;not surprisingly, since Hanseatic merchants from Dortmund had been playing an important part in the English wool trade from about 1275. Between 1340 and 1350 Lemberg was one of Edward III's leading bankers. In order to finance his wars in France the king badly needed larger sums of money than could be raised from the crown's regular income, through direct taxation or by additional wool subsidies granted by parliament, while his former Florentine bankers, the Bardi and Peruzzi, had collapsed in 1340 and so were no longer at his disposal. During the 1340s, at first along with his Westphalian compatriots Johann vom Walde, Johann Klepping, and others, and afterwards in company with English merchants like Walter Chiriton and Gilbert Wendlinburgh, Lemberg negotiated five substantial loans, for a total of more than &pound;100,000, on the king's behalf. It is difficult to analyse the structure of these transactions in detail, because new loans might be agreed before the earlier ones had been repaid; methods of repayment might be altered while a loan was still outstanding, and it is seldom possible to tell which payments were made for which loans. Repayments of the king's debts were made from customs on exported wool; the lenders might be given licences to export specified quantities of wool, wool-fells, and hides, or granted customs reductions or even exemptions, or customs revenues might be in part transferred to the king's creditors, or placed in pawn to them. These transactions were so organized that the loans were made on the continent, where the king needed the money, while repayments were made in England, so that the German merchants then had at their disposal the money they needed for buying wool. And at the same time dangerous and costly shipments of money could be avoided.<br>
<br>Lemberg won Edward III's particular favour in 1343, when he made two loans, of nearly 50,000 florins (&pound;8850), to redeem the royal crowns and other jewels which in 1339 had been given in pledge to Archbishop Baldwin of Trier and certain citizens of Cologne respectively. The king's German creditors, headed by Lemberg, consequently came to be temporarily possessed both of the entire customs revenue from wool shipped out of all the English ports from Bristol to Newcastle, and of one part of the revenues of the cocket seals. The extent of their profits cannot be calculated exactly, but they were clearly substantial. Lemberg's commercial activities, too, benefited considerably from the confidence that Edward III placed in him, which in 1347 gave him the opportunity to secure for all Hanseatic merchants a limited exemption from customs duties.<br>
<br>After that year Lemberg no longer confined his activities to trading in wool. In 1347 he farmed the coinage dues from all the Cornish tin mines (at 40<i>s</i>. per hundredweight), and secured for three years the entire revenue from the stannaries of Devon and Cornwall. At this time Lemberg, who already owned a house in London, seems to have intended to settle permanently in England, and may even have aimed at becoming a country gentleman, since in 1348 he purchased estates in several counties. But when the final settlement of the large sums due to him was being organized at the exchequer in the spring of 1352, numerous irregularities came to light. It became increasingly difficult for Lemberg to prove the legitimacy either of his demands or of the payments he had already received. He was accused of embezzlement, of illegal dealings in royal bonds, and of dishonest use of tin scales, and several actions were brought against him. In 1352 his tin supplies were confiscated in compensation for irregular receipts from the customs, and he was even temporarily arrested. Lemberg was able to negotiate a settlement with the king and with his English creditors, but he was obliged to leave England. He sold his estates to the sons of William de la Pole (<i>d</i>. 1366) and moved to Cologne.<br>
<br>In 1359, however, Lemberg returned to England. He farmed the lead and copper mines at Alston Moor, Cumberland, and acquired the right to exploit them as he pleased, having negotiated an agreement with the crown under which the latter took 15 per cent of the profits. A debt of 5000 marks at the exchequer was pardoned by the king, to whom Lemberg once more became a lender, this time of 1000 marks. In return he and his partners received customs reductions at Boston. However in 1363 he finally left England. At first he moved to his native town of Dortmund, but strained relations with its leading families made it impossible for him to remain there, and so in 1367 he once more settled in Cologne, where he was active in the wine trade and as a financier. He gave generous support to the Carthusian monastery of St Barbara, and in his will remembered other religious houses and collegiate churches in Cologne, among them the Augustinian friary, where he was laid to rest following his death in Cologne on 29 July 1386.<br>
