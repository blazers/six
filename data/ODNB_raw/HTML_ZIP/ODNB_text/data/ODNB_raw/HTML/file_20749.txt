<span class="headword">&Oacute; Maoilchonaire <span class="st"> [O' Maelchonaire]</span>,  Fearfeasa</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1630&#150;1646), <span class="occ">antiquary and poet</span>, was born some time in the late sixteenth century in Cluain Ploc&aacute;in (Cluain Bolc&aacute;in) or Ballymulconry, in the parish of Kiltrustan, co. Roscommon, the chief place of the U&iacute; Mhaoilchonaire family. He was the son of Lochlann &Oacute; Maoilchonaire, a member of the younger branch of a family which from antiquity had been hereditary bards and chroniclers to the kings of Connaught. Almost nothing is known of his career beyond his collaboration between 1630 and 1633 with M&iacute;ch&aacute;el &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh OFM, C&uacute;coigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Duibhgenn&aacute;in, and C&uacute;coigcr&iacute;che &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh on a series of major historical enterprises, including a compilation of the genealogies of the kings and saints of Ireland, an edition of an eleventh-century pseudo-historical account of the successive prehistoric invasions of Ireland known as <span class="italic">Leabhar gabh&aacute;la</span>, and, above all, a history of Ireland from the creation up to their own time traditionally known as the annals of the four masters. The last work constitutes the largest single collection of annalistic material relating to Ireland. Because it is largely a copy of older manuscript material no longer extant, it now preserves a unique record of events over considerable spans of time. &Oacute; Maoilchonaire collaborated with M&iacute;ch&aacute;el &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh and the other chroniclers on the first part only of this multi-volume work, covering events to 1333, the transcription of which was completed in 1632 in the Franciscan convent of Drowes or Bundrowes on Donegal Bay, co. Donegal. He states that he checked the old manuscripts of the martyrology of Gorm&aacute;n, of which a transcript had been made by Brother M&iacute;ch&aacute;el. It is now the only copy remaining of this liturgical calendar. Since &Oacute; Maoilchonaire was descended from a family of hereditary antiquaries it is very likely that he not only gave his services as scribe and chronicler but also contributed some source material to the enterprise, including a &#145;Book of Cluain Ploc&aacute;in&#146;, referred to in a number of sources. Moreover, his name appears three times after &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh's in the dedications and prefaces to the works mentioned above, which preceded the compilation of the annals, indicating his importance to the scholarly enterprise, but in third place in the dedicatory preface to the annals. His handwriting has not yet been identified in the original manuscripts.<br>
<br>When Tuileagna &Oacute; Maoilchonaire, also a Franciscan author and a kinsman of Fearfeasa &Oacute; Maoilchonaire, tried over a number of years, between 1638 and 1646, to prevent publication of the works compiled by &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh and his collaborators, Fearfeasa was the chief respondent, since &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh was dead. He appeared before a provincial chapter of Irish Franciscans at Multyfarnam in August 1641, where the decision went against Tuileagna. The latter's persistence finally elicited two responses from Fearfeasa in Irish, the first in an open letter entitled &#145;To the reader&#151;a reply&#146;  (printed in Walsh's edition of the <span class="italic">Genealogiae</span>, 6.150&#150;53), the second a long reply in verse entitled &#145;Beag t&aacute;irthear [do]n tagra mbaoith&#146; (&#145;Foolish debate achieves nothing&#146;; Mhag Craith, no. 39). Both were penned in 1646, and nothing further is heard of Fearfeasa after that date. The annals and other compilations were not published until the nineteenth century, not because of Tuileagna's objections, but because of the extreme poverty of the Louvain community. Notwithstanding his long association with the Franciscan order and this enterprise, Fearfeasa &Oacute; Maoilchonaire was a layman. His son Peadar was poet to the &Oacute; Rodaighe family of co. Leitrim, specifically to Tadhg &Oacute; Rodaighe. About six poems by him are extant.<br>
<br>The &Oacute; Maoilchonaire family was one of the most distinguished learned families in Ireland, supplying a long line of important poets, chroniclers, and ecclesiastics. O'Reilly's <span class="italic">Catalogue of Irish Writers</span> lists fourteen poets of that name from 1310 onwards. Fearfeasa's kinsman Flaithr&iacute; &Oacute; Maoilchonaire (Florence Conry, as he is more usually known), archbishop of Tuam, in 1607 founded St Anthony's College, Louvain, where M&iacute;ch&aacute;el &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh and his collaborators sought to publish their work. Muirghes mac P&aacute;id&iacute;n &Oacute; Maoilchonaire copied the <span class="roman">Book of Fenagh</span> from an earlier exemplar for the &Oacute; Rodaighe family, under whose patronage Fearfeasa's son Peadar later worked. It is written in both prose and verse and purports to be a statement of the dues owing to the high king of Ireland from his sub-kings and of his reciprocal duties to them. The name &Oacute; Maoilchonaire is of frequent occurrence in the fiants. In particular, a fiant of Elizabeth I in 1585 names a &#145;Ferfesse O Mulconry of same&#146; (that is of Clonpluckane, or Ballymulconry, co. Roscommon), who must have been a kinsman of Fearfeasa. A poem attributed to &#145;Ferfesa mac Lochlainn U&iacute; Mhaoilchonaire&#146; written in honour of Calvach Rua &Oacute; Domhnaill of Connaught and entitled &#145;Mo chean do chuairt a Chalbhaigh&#146;, now preserved in an eighteenth-century manuscript in the National Library of Ireland, is almost certainly Fearfeasa's. Nothing further is known of him beyond these scraps of biography. Because of the appalling events brought on by the rising of 1641 and its aftermath, the earliest copies of the four masters' works survived for many years on the continent and were only brought back to Ireland in the nineteenth century and published. &Oacute; Maoilchonaire's works are preserved in manuscripts in the libraries of the Royal Irish Academy and Trinity College, Dublin, in the Franciscan library at Killiney, the Biblioth&egrave;que Royale, Brussels, and the National Library of Ireland.<br>
