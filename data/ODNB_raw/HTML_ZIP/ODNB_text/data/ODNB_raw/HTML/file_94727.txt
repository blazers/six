<span class="headword">Moir,  John William</span>  (1851&#150;1940), <span class="occ">trader in Africa</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 26 January 1851 and baptized there on 16 March 1851, the son of John Moir, a prominent Edinburgh physician, and his wife, Margaret Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maitland. His brother <a name="cosubject_96916"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Lewis Maitland Moir</span>  (1852&#150;1939), <span class="occ">trader in Africa</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 20 February 1852 and baptized there on 8 April 1852. After attending school and some university classes in Edinburgh the brothers embarked on commercial careers. Evangelical Christians, brought up in the Free Church of Scotland, they were inspired not only by the death of David Livingstone but also by the American crusaders Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey. Their first contact with Africa came when they were recruited in 1877 to work on William Mackinnon's ill-fated scheme to build a road from Dar es Salaam to Lake Tanganyika. In the following year they transferred their attention to the alternative, river route into central Africa, becoming the founding managers of the Livingstonia Central Africa Company, known from 1881 as the African Lakes Company, and from 1894 as the African Lakes Corporation. The company was sponsored by a group of Glasgow businessmen to provide logistical support to the Livingstonia Mission of the Free Church of Scotland, which had put a steamer, the <i>Ilala</i>, on Lake Nyasa in 1875. The company was intended to run steamers on the Zambezi and Shire rivers, and on lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika, and to put into practice Livingstone's idea that the slave trade could best be combated by a combination of &#145;commerce and Christianity&#146;.<br>
<br>In the early years the Moir brothers struggled against numerous obstacles to get the business up and running. These included shortages of capital and staff, endemic malaria and other diseases, Portuguese obstruction, the difficulty of access from the ocean to the Zambezi, and an underpowered river steamer, the <i>Lady Nyassa</i>. They succeeded, nevertheless, in establishing a base for themselves at Mandala (John Moir's African name and the name by which the company was commonly known) near the Blantyre mission in the Shire highlands, and in developing a viable route into the interior of east-central Africa. In spite of initial difficulties they succeeded in founding a business that made a distinctly Scottish contribution to the &#145;scramble for Africa&#146; and that survived into the twenty-first century.<br>
<br>As explorers the Moir brothers undertook some of the first expeditions into parts of what later became northern Malawi and eastern Zambia. Among their achievements was the transport of the parts of the steamer, the <i>Good News</i>, over 1000 miles to Lake Tanganyika on behalf of the London Missionary Society. This was facilitated by the development in the mid-1880s of the Stevenson Road (named after James Stevenson, a chemical manufacturer and the company's chairman) from the north end of Lake Nyasa to the south end of Lake Tanganyika&#151;though this was in reality more of a trail than a road. After more than a decade of struggle they had by the early 1890s established a transport system, using both the <i>Ilala</i> and the <i>Good News</i>, which was, until the building of railways in the early decades of the twentieth century, the main route for missionaries, traders, and officials, into the African lakes region.<br>
<br>The economics of trade and transport made it almost impossible for the Moir brothers to put into practice Livingstone's theory that legitimate commerce&#151;the buying of crops from peasant producers&#151;would stop the slave trade, though they did buy oil seeds on the lower Shire and began the cultivation of coffee in the Shire highlands. They found that ivory was still the only commodity that would bear the cost of freight to the coast and to Europe. They were soon drawn into elephant hunting and ivory trading at the north end of Lake Nyasa. An apparently amicable ivory-trading relationship with an Arab or Swahili trader, Mlozi, at Karonga, turned sour in 1887 when he and his allies sought to drive out the local Ngonde people, who had been encouraged to seek, and had been promised, protection by the company. This was the cause of the &#145;Arab War&#146;, which dragged on until 1889 and ended in stalemate. It attracted an immense amount of publicity and was a major contributor to the popular demand for British intervention in the region. Among those who participated in the war was the young Captain Frederick Lugard, later to become Britain's most famous African proconsul. The Moirs were both wounded in this conflict, and Frederick Moir's right arm was permanently damaged.<br>
<br>While Frederick Moir participated in the Berlin conference of 1884&#150;5 John Moir organized petitions to Queen Victoria from African chiefs. These were intended to demonstrate &#145;effective occupation&#146; and to provide backing for British claims to areas that were also claimed by Portugal and Germany. The line of the Stevenson Road became in 1890 the boundary between the British and German spheres of influence (and later marked the boundary between Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania). John Moir was also actively involved, with Vice-Consul John Buchanan, in seeking to stop Portuguese expansion into the Shire highlands in 1889&#150;90, resulting in Lord Salisbury's ultimatum to Portugal of January 1890.<br>
<br>Between 1889 and 1893 there were negotiations for the amalgamation of the then relatively well-known African Lakes Company with the initially unknown British South Africa Company, and discussion of the extension of the joint company's charter to cover Nyasaland. There was, however, a fundamental incompatibility between the ethical bases of the two companies. Harry Johnston, then an ally of Cecil Rhodes, and the first commissioner in British Central Africa, blamed John Moir for driving a wedge between the two sides and launched vitriolic attacks on him, his brother, and their company. The difficult relationship between the two companies culminated in 1892&#150;3 in litigation and separation, but the &#145;the reign of the Moirs&#146; was already over. There is no doubt that they deserved some of the brickbats that came their way. The explorer Joseph Thomson, for example, provided this assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in a letter to Rhodes in 1891.<blockquote>Two more interesting or remarkable men it would be difficult to find. The very beau-ideal of commercial and philanthropic pioneers in wild country they have slaved and suffered with an unselfish enthusiastic devotion. But it is only as pioneers that they have shone; as managers of a going concern requiring unusual business capacities and breadth of view they have signally failed. They could lay splendid foundations but they could not build upon them and however hard it may seem it was necessary for them to leave that to other hands and brains. (Macmillan, 348)</blockquote>John Moir married, in Edinburgh on 2 May 1882, (Helen) Elizabeth Tod (<i>b</i>. 1851/2), daughter of Henry Tod, writer to the signet; they had one son and one daughter. Frederick Moir married, in Partick, on 10 April 1885, Jane Fordyce Beith (<i>b</i>. 1857), daughter of Gilbert Beith, merchant and later Liberal MP for Glasgow Central and for Inverness Burghs. John Moir left Africa in March 1890, expecting to return as a manager of the amalgamated company, and Frederick Moir left in June 1891 with similar expectations. Frederick Moir did not return to Africa, but became secretary of the company in Glasgow, remaining involved with it as a director, or chairman, until his death. In spite of Joseph Thomson's strictures, he succeeded in overseeing the company's emergence as a successful, and more or less conventional, transport, trading, and planting business with an extensive network of stores in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, as well as rubber, tea, and tobacco plantations. He revisited Africa only once, in 1921, and was the author of a successful memoir, <span class="italic">After Livingstone</span> (1923). John Moir returned to Nyasaland (then British Central Africa) in 1893 and became a pioneer tea planter, founding the Lauderdale estate in the Mlanje district. A stern critic of Harry Johnston's aggressive and militaristic approach to the occupation of the country, he retired to Edinburgh in 1900 and devoted much of his time to beekeeping; he claimed in his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry to have built up the best collection of books on bees in the British empire. He never lost his interest in Africa&#151;indeed, not long before his death he entertained to tea a medical student from Nyasaland, Hastings Kamuzu Banda. He had by then received belated recognition for his pioneering work through an invitation to attend the coronation of George VI as a representative of Nyasaland, and appointment as CMG in 1937. Frederick Moir died of heart failure at 16 Kensington Gate, Glasgow, on 2 November 1939, having been predeceased by his wife. John Moir died, also of heart failure, at 15 Polwarth Grove, Edinburgh, on 13 March 1940; he was survived by his wife.<br>
