<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maude,  Angus Edmund Upton</span>, Baron Maude of Stratford upon Avon  (1912&#150;1993), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born on 8 September 1912 at 44 Temple Fortune Lane, Hendon, Middlesex, the only child of Alan Hamer Maude (1885&#150;1979), journalist and army officer, and his wife, Dorothy Maude Upton, only daughter of Frederic Upton, civil servant. The Maudes were an old-established family of Yorkshire gentry and included several notable bankers and naval officers; one of Maude's forebears was an officer in Cromwell's army at Marston Moor, and another was a godson of William IV. Maude's father was a sub-editor on <span class="italic">The Times</span> and later a colonel in the Royal Army Service Corps, serving with great distinction in the First World War.<br>
<br>Like his father, Maude was educated at Rugby School (where he was a classical scholar) and at Oriel College, Oxford, where he served on the committees of both the Union Society and the Conservative Association and from where he graduated with a second-class degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1933. He then joined his father's profession, working on <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1933&#150;4) and then the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> (1934&#150;9) as a financial journalist. Commissioned as a Territorial Army officer four months before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he saw action in north Africa but was captured in January 1942 and spent the rest of the conflict as a prisoner of war. Although shy, he helped to organize theatrical activities. On 2 January 1946 he married Barbara Elizabeth Earnshaw (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of John Earnshaw Sutcliffe, artist, of Bushey, Hertfordshire. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>After the war Maude found an outlet for his restless intelligence at an independent think-tank, Political and Economic Planning, where he served as a deputy director. It was an unusual posting for a man who was later associated with the anti-statist wing of the Conservative Party; the group's work suggested an active (if not directive) role for government. But the job seemed to fit Maude for a post-war Conservative Party which had accepted a more interventionist state than had existed previously. In 1949 he was chosen as the Conservative candidate for South Ealing, and in the same year his researches bore fruit in his most popular book, <span class="italic">The English Middle Classes</span>, a perceptive account of social change which he wrote with Roy Lewis. This collaboration also produced <span class="italic">Professional People</span> (1952).<br>
<br>Maude was returned at the general election of 1950 with a comfortable majority. As a prospective candidate he had met another young Conservative intellectual, Cuthbert (&#145;Cub&#146;) Alport, and they had discussed forming a ginger group if they both won their seats. This was the first suggestion of what became the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95399', "One Nation group")</script>&#151;formed with seven other MPs including Edward Heath, Iain Macleod, Enoch Powell, and Robert Carr. Maude played a key role in co-ordinating the work on the group's first (eponymous) pamphlet, which was widely touted as a distinctive Conservative approach to the social services at a time of economic stringency. Maude was also heavily involved in the group's next production, <span class="italic">Change is our Ally</span> (1954), which indicated a more sceptical view of the state. By the time the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, membership of One Nation was already seen as a likely passport to ministerial office. But Maude and Powell were repeatedly overlooked, suggesting that the Conservative whips had already noted them as mercurial characters. Neither was prepared to suffer fools. In Maude's case the failure to secure a footing was particularly significant, since in addition to his One Nation work he served as director of his party's educational wing, the Conservative Political Centre, for four years after 1951. He was also an effective Commons speaker, if not quite up to the standard set by his friends Macleod and Powell. His main handicap seems to have been an inability to court influential allies; his son later described him as &#145;the world's worst networker&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>By 1956 Maude was a disappointed man. A member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92384', "Suez group")</script>, he resigned the Conservative whip in May 1957 and sat for a year as an independent Conservative, in protest against British policy towards Cyprus. The fact that Maude, who had always concentrated on domestic policy, should choose to associate with his party's imperialist wing revealed how disillusioned he had become. In 1958 he took this emotion to its logical conclusion, resigning his seat (much to the embarrassment of Harold Macmillan's government) and accepting the post of editor at the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>. Nevertheless the Australian exile lasted only three years. Before his departure friends warned him that he would be disappointed if he expected to enjoy full editorial independence, and so it proved. But he enjoyed Australia, where he also hosted an important televised discussion programme. In 1961 he was back in England, actively searching for a seat. Fortunately for him, in October 1961 Iain Macleod became chairman of the party, and by November 1962 Maude had been chosen to fight a by-election in a safe Conservative seat, South Dorset. Ironically, another old acquaintance thwarted his comeback. Viscount Hinchingbroke, whose elevation to the Lords had created the vacancy, was a fellow Suez rebel, but unlike Maude he could no longer support a Conservative leadership which was anxious to join the Common Market. Hinchingbroke threw his weight behind an independent Conservative, Sir Piers Debenham, who won 5000 votes; Maude was defeated by a narrow margin. During the by-election campaign Maude's abrasive personality attracted unfavourable press attention, and even he thought that his career was at an end. But in August 1963 he was allowed another attempt, at Stratford upon Avon, which had been represented by the disgraced minister John Profumo. Maude won the seat with a greatly reduced majority, but this was a creditable performance, since the Macmillan government was more than 10 per cent behind Labour in the national opinion polls.<br>
<br>After the Conservatives fell from power in 1964 there were signs that Maude was willing to play a more orthodox role within his party. When Enoch Powell stood for the leadership in July 1965 Maude voted for Reginald Maudling. Earlier Alec Home had appointed Maude opposition spokesman on aviation. It was some surprise when the new leader, Edward Heath, kept him on in this role; after all, Heath had been chief whip during the Suez crisis. A falling-out could be predicted, and it came remarkably quickly. In January 1966 <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> published an article by Maude, entitled &#145;Winter of tory discontent&#146;. The author, now spokesman on colonial affairs, warned that his party risked being regarded as an &#145;irrelevance&#146;, and attacked the timidity of its policy proposals. Since Maude lacked a parliamentary following, Heath could dismiss him without fearing the consequences; if the decision made the party look disunited, the errant minister had created this impression already. To underline his political innocence, he was genuinely puzzled by the furious reaction of the leadership.<br>
<br>Since Maude's oft-frustrated hopes of preferment were unlikely to be satisfied while Heath was leader, his decision to fight the general election in 1970 testified to his addiction to parliamentary life. He also continued to write intelligent articles, and in 1969 produced <span class="italic">The Common Problem</span>, a substantial volume which proved him a rigorous and original thinker. Combined with more tact&#151;and, perhaps, a less forbidding aspect&#151;these qualities should have secured high office. Instead, he seemed to be competing with Powell for the role of chief prophet without honour; <span class="italic">The Common Problem</span> has remained an unjustly neglected work of political thinking. By contrast, Maude's contribution to the <span class="italic">Black Papers</span>, which challenged current educational theory, was well publicized; but it did nothing to endear him to a party leadership unwilling to oppose the introduction of comprehensive schools. He also joined Powell in voting against the <span class="roman">Race Relations Bill</span> (1968). During the Heath government he was an occasional rebel, particularly over EEC membership (although he avoided a serious clash with his constituency party by abstaining, rather than voting against the British application). His main influence was exerted through a critical and widely read <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> column. Although he had passed his sixtieth birthday by the time of the general election of February 1974, he stood again. But only the prospect of a radical change in the party's direction can have induced him to seek election in the second 1974 contest, held in October.<br>
<br>When Thatcher contested Heath's leadership in January 1975, Maude was an enthusiastic supporter, and he drafted the impressive statement of principles published under her name in the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> just before the election. When Thatcher won the leadership on the second ballot Maude was appointed chairman of the Conservative Research Department. In theory it was an apposite choice; Maude could be relied upon to uphold the &#145;Thatcherite&#146; line in an institution which the new leadership deeply distrusted. As usual with Maude, there was an element of irony in the appointment because Powell, whose brilliance had helped to make the reputation of the research department in the late 1940s, had by this time joined the Ulster Unionists&#151;an act of self-immolation which surpassed even the gestures of his old friend. Maude did make a significant contribution, but morale in the research department was low throughout his chairmanship, and his precise role was difficult to define since Sir Keith Joseph had been given overall charge of policy research. Maude's main achievement was to help with the drafting of <span class="italic">The Right Approach</span> (1976), which cleverly steered a middle course to paper over the divisions between Conservative &#145;wets&#146; and &#145;dries&#146;.<br>
<br>When the Conservatives won the general election in 1979 Maude was made paymaster-general, with a seat in the cabinet and membership of the privy council. It had been a tortuous career path, but at last it seemed that Maude had reached a destination suited to his talents. But he would have preferred a departmental post, preferably in education, and it was his ill fortune to be given responsibility for government policy at a time when there was no cheering news to impart. At the end of Thatcher's first year in power ministers had to admit that they had failed to meet expectations, but in the search for scapegoats Maude was always likely to be vulnerable. In January 1981 he stood down from the cabinet. Thatcher later claimed that this was at his own request, but he was most reluctant to leave. He remained on good terms with the prime minister, who awarded him a knighthood. Before the next election he was appointed chairman of a government committee on questions of policy, but this was his last official appointment. He left the Commons at the 1983 election, and was made a life peer, as Baron Maude of Stratford upon Avon, shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>Maude remained an active member of the Lords for many years, able at last to lend consistent support to the policies of his own party. He also had the satisfaction of seeing his son Francis rise within the ranks, becoming financial secretary to the Treasury in 1990, although his final years were touched by tragedy when his other son, Charles, died from an AIDS-related illness. Maude himself was already unwell. He died peacefully of old age and haemochromatosis at the Foscote Hospital, Banbury, on 9 November 1993 and was buried at South Newington, Oxfordshire. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, his son Francis, and his two daughters.<br>
<br>The leading theme of Maude's life was that of talent unfulfilled. Too self-willed to reach the top in politics, he could have achieved lasting fame as a writer but seemingly lacked sufficient application. There was some satisfaction in the success of his party, which at the time of his death seemed destined for many more years in power. But he was ill suited to the role of unthinking loyalist, and had he written a follow-up to <span class="italic">The Common Problem</span> his idiosyncratic ideas might have helped to inject much needed intellectual excitement into his party.<br>
