<span class="headword">Walters,  Catherine</span> <span class="st"> [<em>nicknamed </em>Skittles; <em>known as </em>Mrs Baillie]</span>  (1839&#150;1920), <span class="occ">courtesan</span>, was born on 13 June 1839 at 1 Henderson Street, Toxteth, Liverpool, the third of the five children of Edward Walters (<i>d</i>. 1864), a customs employee, and his wife, Mary Ann Fowler. She was baptized as a Roman Catholic. Three attributes saved Catherine from the fate of most girls growing up in dockside Liverpool: her exceptional beauty, her practical nature, and her riding skills, acquired while working in a livery stable. Cheerfully amoral, she became, at the age of sixteen, the mistress of George, Lord Fitzwilliam, master of the Fitzwilliam hounds. He set her up in London and, on finally parting from her, made her a generous settlement. It was perhaps under his guidance that she developed her passion for hunting: in later years she was to ride regularly with the Quorn.<br>
<br>Small and slender, with grey-blue eyes and chestnut-coloured hair, Catherine Walters never looked like a whore; she dressed with an unexpected decorousness. But there was nothing decorous about her talk: she was effervescent, outspoken, bawdy. Her naturalness was one of her chief attractions. Unlike so many prostitutes, she remained affectionate and sympathetic. &#145;She was the only whore in history to retain her heart intact,&#146; wrote the journalist Henry Labouchere  (Blyth, xii).<br>
<br>It was as one of the celebrated &#145;horse-breakers&#146; who paraded in Hyde Park that Catherine Walters first attracted wide public attention. She particularly drew the young <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32331/', "Spencer Cavendish, Lord Hartington")</script>, eldest son of the seventh duke of Devonshire. By 1859 she had become his mistress and was installed in a house in Mayfair, with an annual allowance. By that time she was known as Skittles, possibly a reference to the fact that in youth she had earned a few pence by setting up the skittles in some local bowling alley. Once, when Lord Hartington was accompanying that tireless practical joker the prince of Wales on an official visit to Coventry, the mayor drew Hartington's attention to the town's bowling alley, explaining that the prince had asked especially for its inclusion in their tour in tribute to Hartington's love of skittles.<br>
<br>When her relationship with Lord Hartington cooled, Catherine Walters moved to France. Here she quickly established herself as one of that select band of <i>grandes cocottes</i> who were such a feature of Second Empire Paris. Among her many admirers was the young poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31938/', "Wilfrid Scawen Blunt (1840&#150;1922)")</script>, who fell deeply in love with her and with whom she remained on good terms for the rest of her life. She was the inspiration for his narrative poem &#145;Esther&#146;.<br>
<br>By the fall of the Second Empire in 1870, Catherine Walters was back in England, dividing her time between hunting and entertaining a varied circle of men. Her Sunday afternoon tea parties were famous. Among her guests were W. E. Gladstone (though there is nothing in Gladstone's diaries to substantiate this) who was fascinated by prostitutes but with whom her relationship seems to have been platonic; and Albert Edward, prince of Wales [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32975/', "Edward VII")</script>], with whom it apparently was not. Even after their liaison had ended, the prince paid her an allowance and, whenever she was ill, sent his own doctor to attend to her. His letters to her were so confidential that once, when she was thought to be dying, he had his private secretary collect and destroy over three hundred of them.<br>
<br>In 1872 Catherine Walters moved to 15 South Street, Park Lane, London, where she lived for the rest of her life. By the mid-1880s she was calling herself Mrs Baillie, but it seems unlikely that she actually married Alexander Horatio Baillie. Close friends of her sunset years were the faithful Blunt and the Hon. Gerald de Saumarez, whom she had first met when he was a schoolboy and to whom she bequeathed the bulk of her estate. Crippled by arthritis, she died at 15 South Street, of a cerebral haemorrhage, on 5 August 1920. Blunt arranged for her to be buried in the churchyard of the Franciscan monastery in Crawley, Sussex.<br>
