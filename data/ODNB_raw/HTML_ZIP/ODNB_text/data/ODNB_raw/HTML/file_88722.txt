<span class="headword">Broom, Sir  Ivor Gordon</span>  (1920&#150;2003), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 2 June 1920 at 41 Lansdowne Road, Cardiff, the only child of Alfred Godfrey Broom, district manager for the Prudential Assurance Company and a Baptist preacher, and his wife, Janet Rodger, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. He was educated at west Monmouth grammar school and Pontypridd county school, and successfully passed the civil service examination. On leaving school, aged seventeen, he worked as an Inland Revenue tax officer, first in Banbury and then in Ipswich. A position in the civil service was, at that time, considered a &#145;job for life&#146;, but six months after the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 Broom made what was to prove a permanent career move, by enlisting in the Royal Air Force.<br>
<br>Following flying training at RAF Cranfield during the height of the battle of Britain, Broom was posted to 114 squadron in 1941. 114 squadron was equipped with Blenheim twin-engine bombers. Blenheims were an unpopular aeroplane among aircrews, on account of their high loss rate. However, the ever optimistic Broom was unperturbed. He flew with the squadron on daylight raids over the channel and French and Dutch coasts. His leadership ability was quickly noted and in the late summer of 1941 he led a detachment of Blenheims to Malta. There he and his crew were &#145;hijacked&#146; by Air Vice-Marshal Hugh Pughe Lloyd to reinforce the beleaguered 107 squadron, which had suffered a phenomenally high number of losses. Broom was immediately launched into maritime strike operations, and confirmed Lloyd's faith in his skill. Lloyd made Broom a pilot officer, telling him to move his stuff into the officers' mess and the paper work would be sorted later. Broom's leadership and courage in Malta were recognized with the award of the DFC in January 1942.<br>
<br>Broom returned to Britain in February 1942 and was &#145;rested&#146; from operational flying by undertaking a tour as an instructor on Mosquitoes. It was at 1655 Mosquito training unit that he met the navigator Flight Lieutenant Tommy Broom, with whom he established a successful partnership, becoming known as the Flying Brooms. (They had an emblem of crossed broomsticks painted on the nose of their aircraft.) They were soon posted to 517 squadron, where Ivor was awarded a bar to his DFC and Tommy a DFC for their successful mine-laying operation over the Dortmund&#150;Ems canal on the night of 9&#150;10 August 1944. By now a wing commander, Broom saw out the Second World War in Europe in command of 163 squadron, although not before his characteristic determination saw him awarded a second bar to his DFC for bombing a railway tunnel near Kaiserslautern, Germany, in January 1945 with 128 squadron. He had meanwhile, on 25 July 1942, married Jessie Irene (Jess) Cooper, a nineteen-year-old shop assistant from Ipswich, and daughter of William Joseph Cooper, merchant. They had two sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Broom's first post-war posting to 28 squadron in Singapore was something of a surprise&#151;the squadron was equipped with Spitfires, an aircraft that he had never flown before but quickly set about mastering. He returned from Singapore in 1948 and attended staff college. On passing out he re-formed 57 squadron, equipped with English Electric Canberra jet bombers. Following a tour of the Middle East with 57 squadron he worked for a period at the Air Ministry and then for two years at the RAF Flying College, Manby. At Manby he became involved in what was to be one of his career highlights, piloting a Canberra, <i>Aries IV</i>, non-stop from Ottawa to London on 28 June 1955. At an average speed of 496.8 m.p.h. the flight set a new transatlantic air speed record, for which Broom was awarded an Air Force Cross in 1956.<br>
<br>In 1956 Broom took charge of the Bomber Command development unit at RAF Wittering, a job that he regarded as one of his most fulfilling. This was followed by further desk appointments at the Air Ministry until October 1962, when he was appointed station commander at RAF Bruggen, Germany. Back home after two years he once again found himself working at the Air Ministry, as director of organization (establishments), and received promotion to air commodore. The latter years of his RAF career saw two prestigious appointments, first as commandant of Central Flying School (1968&#150;70), where he suffered a serious flying accident while piloting one of the Red Arrows' Gnat aircraft, and second as air officer commanding 11 (fighter) group, Strike Command, which saw him qualify as a pilot on Lightning and Phantom aircraft. His final RAF appointments were as deputy controller (1972&#150;4) then controller (1974&#150;7) of National Air Traffic Services, the latter appointment carrying with it membership of the board of the Civil Aviation Authority. He was appointed CBE in 1969, CB in 1972, and KCB in 1975.<br>
<br>Broom retired from the RAF in 1977, with the rank of air marshal. In retirement he was as active as ever, becoming a popular and enthusiastic supporter of many veterans' associations, including the RAF Association (of which he was vice-president from 1981), the Pathfinder Association (of which he was president in 1990&#150;93), and the Blenheim Society (of which he was president from 1990). He also worked part-time as an international aerospace consultant, and was chairman of Gatwick Handling Ltd (1982&#150;93) and Farnborough Aerospace Development Corporation (1985&#150;92). A keen golfer, he was president of Moor Park Golf Club (1992&#150;7). Described by his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituarist as &#145;a great RAF party man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Jan 2003), he was also a committed Christian and teetotaller, noted for his wit and good humour. He died of prostate cancer at the Peace Hospice, Watford, Hertfordshire, near his home in Loudwater, Rickmansworth, on 24 January 2003. He was survived by his wife and their three children.<br>
