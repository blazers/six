<span class="headword">Law,  Samuel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1772&#150;1783), <span class="occ">poet and weaver</span>, is of unknown origins. The title-page to his single publication, <span class="italic">A domestic winter-piece: a poem, exhibiting a full view of the author's dwelling place in the winter-season. In two parts. Interspersed with a great variety of entertaining reflections</span> (1772), tells that the author lived in the village of Barewise, near Todmorden, Yorkshire, near the border with Lancashire. Archival records held in Halifax of contracts to enter into a cotton manufacturing business indicate that later on Law may also have lived in Toad Carr and then in Hundersfield, and that he supplemented his work as a weaver with work as a clog maker.<br>
<br>In the preface to his poem Law claims to have been illiterate until the age of twenty-one, and to have suffered many &#145;grievous calamities&#146; in the years subsequent. Like many other eighteenth-century labouring-class poets, Law published his poem by subscription. In the autobiographical preface to <span class="italic">A Domestic Winter-Piece</span>, Law appeals to his readers' charity, reminding them that he undertook the composition of his poem without thought of publication, and dedicated himself to his studies only in hours stolen from sleep. He claims to have sought solace in poetical musings while at his loom to distract himself from the torments of the winter season. The overtly pious and self-deprecating tone of the poem and its prefatory material suggest that Law was a humble man with no great literary aspirations. None the less the poem is directly modelled upon James Thomson's <span class="italic">Seasons</span>, and Law attempts many of the same poetic techniques, including similar panoramic sweeps and eagle's eye views of his native region. The numerous classical allusions (particularly in the first part of the poem), all of which are carefully documented by the author's footnotes, contradict Law's claim to a total lack of poetic education. The poem perhaps outdoes Thomson's in its vivid presentation of the ghastly horrors caused by the winter weather and approaches an almost Gothic representation of the sublime horror inspired by the season. In his preface Law explains that he chose to describe his native region because:<blockquote>It is more like a dreadful wilderness of stony promontories, and direful sinking vales, where roaring lions, savage bears, ravenous wolves, hissing snakes, and horrid birds of prey resort, than an inheritance from any of the human race. And the singularity whereof, was the very first motive that induced me to write a poetical essay on Winter; giving a display of Nature's face, even as it, in this strange, sequestered, solitary desert, appears, when terrible storms and tempests roar, and binding frosts intensely freeze.</blockquote>The second part of the poem relies upon biblical rather than classical allusions and focuses particularly on the figure of Wisdom as a source of solace to poets and other rural dwellers enduring the hardships of the season.The religious themes of the poem and Law's emphasis on the morally beneficial effects of his self-improvement, as well as the absence of historical records pertaining to baptism or marriage for Law, would indicate that he may have been Methodist. His work is significant in so far as it bespeaks the variety of poetic production by labouring-class poets. The poem's direct relationship to Thomson's masterpiece reveals not only Thomson's widespread and enduring popularity throughout the eighteenth century but also the self-conscious erudition of labouring-class writers.<br>
