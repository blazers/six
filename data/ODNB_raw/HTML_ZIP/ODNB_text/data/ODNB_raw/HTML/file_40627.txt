<span class="headword">Cavendish,  Henry</span>, second duke of Newcastle upon Tyne  (1630&#150;1691), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 24 June 1630, the fourth but second surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4946/', "William Cavendish, first duke of Newcastle upon Tyne (bap. 1593, d. 1676)")</script>, and his first wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1643), daughter of William Bassett of Blore, Staffordshire, and widow of Henry Howard. He was educated at home, and the principles that were to govern his life were instilled at an early age by his father. Before the battle of Marston Moor in 1644, Newcastle refused to send Lord Henry and his elder brother Charles Cavendish, Viscount Mansfield (1620&#150;1659), to safety, for they &#145;should show their loyalty and duty to his Majesty in venturing their lives as well as himself&#146;  (Cavendish, 93). Lord Henry went into exile with his father, but returned in the autumn of 1647 to assist in the recovery of the family's estates. Over the next decade this was his main concern, but he was only able to make a financial contribution following the conclusion in May 1653 of the settlement on his marriage to Frances (1629/30&#150;1695), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22231/', "William Pierrepont (1607/8&#150;1678)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth Harris. On the death of his elder brother in June 1659, he became Viscount Mansfield, and from March 1665 was styled earl of Ogle.<br>
<br>Before the elections for the Convention Parliament, Mansfield belatedly approached the earl of Clare, but finding him already committed to candidates for Nottinghamshire, sought a Derbyshire seat. His first election was declared void because of a trick in returning the writs. He arrived at a second poll to defend himself against any attacks by Anabaptists and was successfully returned. Elected the following year for Northumberland to the Cavalier Parliament, his most notable contributions were to defend the first charter to enfranchise Newark and to introduce a bill for the enfranchisement of Durham. Master of the robes at the coronation, he served from May 1660 until his resignation in March 1663, when he was appointed gentleman of the king's bedchamber, a post he retained until the end of the reign. Listed by his friend Danby among the court's supporters in the Commons, he became, as earl of Ogle and then, after the death of his father in December 1676, duke of Newcastle, a strong opponent of exclusion. In the Lords he argued &#145;it was not fitting to bee debated it is to Alter the succession&#146;  (Beer, 34).<br>
<br>It was as joint lieutenant (1670&#150;77) and lieutenant of Northumberland (1677&#150;88), as well as governor of Berwick (1675&#150;86) and lieutenant of Nottinghamshire (1677&#150;88), that Newcastle gave effective service to the crown. In Northumberland he attempted to govern by correspondence and the aid of the local &eacute;lites. In Nottinghamshire, where he had previously served as a deputy lieutenant and which he claimed was the &#145;most factious&#146; county in the kingdom  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>February&#150;December 1685</i>, 105), Newcastle took an active role. After the defeat of his candidate (his brother-in-law Gervase Pierrepont) at the Nottinghamshire election in September 1679 it was not until the summer of 1681 that Newcastle began to promote petitions supporting the king's policies. He became the patron of the Nottingham townsmen who supported the surrender of its charter and their link with the crown. After the defeat of a determined opposition led by the Nottinghamshire whigs, the first elections under the new charter in September 1682 led to riots. Newcastle, by now recorder, was ordered to reside at the castle and to collect evidence to be used against the rioters and their whig supporters. He used news of the Rye House plot to attack the leading Nottinghamshire whigs and to search their houses. He attended the poll at the contested Nottingham parliamentary election of 1685, when for the first time tories were successful as they were in all the Nottinghamshire constituencies.<br>
<br>Reappointed by James II to his lieutenancies in 1685, Newcastle resolved to be loyal, even though he was concerned at the pace of the king's policies in favour of Roman Catholics. Rebuked for the slow return of answers to the three questions posed to lieutenants in February 1686, he sent his resignation with the replies. Pleas to his loyalty persuaded him to resume his duties and when in October 1686 he was appointed lieutenant of the three ridings of Yorkshire, the duke was in effect responsible for the security of the north-east. In September 1688 he was ordered to raise a regiment to secure Newcastle upon Tyne. After the prince of Orange landed at Torbay, Newcastle considered his regiment unnecessary, but his request to be &#145;employed where there is action&#146; was refused  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 348). The support of the militias was essential, and Newcastle believed that the Yorkshire militia would accept a declaration of loyalty to James. When on 19 November he found a petition in favour of a freely elected parliament in circulation he refused to be affronted or overruled by deputies he had appointed, and to show his displeasure left York. He failed&#151;though asked by Reresby, the governor of York&#151;to dismiss the militias and this gave Danby an opportunity to take control. Danby and the earl of Devonshire, who seized Nottingham, had falsely assured Newcastle of their loyalty. When Newcastle decided to take action the militias ignored his orders and he became a prisoner at Welbeck. James accepted that Newcastle's loyalty had left him isolated, and that without troops it was impossible &#145;to dissipate&#146; the rebels. The duke's failure to take decisive action at York was censured and has been seen as a confirmation of his weak, often petulant, character, while his previously effective service has been ignored. In defeat Newcastle insisted he would &#145;always be loyall to the king, firm to his religion and act always according to lawe&#146;: consequently, he refused the oaths of allegiance to William and Mary and to hold office under them (ibid., 350; <span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 545).<br>
<br>Meanwhile Newcastle, whose thoughts were concentrated &#145;upon making his family great&#146;, had been dealt a sudden grievous blow when, on 1 November 1680, his only son, Henry Cavendish, Lord Ogle (<i>b</i>. 1663), died  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters of Sir George Savile</span>, 244). The finding of suitable husbands and dowries for his five daughters had become a major concern. It was the cause of disputes and a separation from his wife who &#145;had had soe great a share of government in that family that she expected that everything should goe as she pleased&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, 437, 472). Sir John Reresby, who acted as an intermediary in a failed marriage negotiation, had an angry dispute with Newcastle, whom he considered was of an &#145;unsteady fickle humour&#146; in these matters  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>). The provision of dowries made a substantial contribution to Newcastle's debts, which at his death exceeded &pound;72,000  (U. Nott. L., PW I 655). He died at Welbeck on 26 July 1691, and was buried on 12 August at Bolsover. In his will of 26 May that year he tried to preserve the family name and estate. His estates were left to Lady Margaret Cavendish, his third surviving and favourite daughter, who had married in February 1690 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13556/', "John Holles, fourth earl of Clare (1662&#150;1711)")</script>. The conditions were that the son or daughter of the marriage must, in honour of the first duke of Newcastle, retain the name of Cavendish, and the estate must pass undivided. The earl of Clare was to take the liabilities of the estate. Attempts made by his brothers-in-law the earls of Thanet and Montague to invalidate the will on the grounds that Newcastle was insane when it was made failed. Newcastle's wife survived her husband, and died in London on 23 September 1695.<br>
