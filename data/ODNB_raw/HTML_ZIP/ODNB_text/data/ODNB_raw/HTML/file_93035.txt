<span class="headword">Terraine,  John Alfred</span>  (1921&#150;2003), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 15 January 1921 at 128 Stondon Park, Forest Hill, Lewisham, London, the son of Charles William Terraine, woollen goods salesman and wartime army officer, and his wife, Eveline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holmes. He was educated at Stamford School and Keble College, Oxford, matriculating in 1939. As a wartime undergraduate Jack Terraine (later in life he reverted to John) was known as a poet and had pronounced left-wing sympathies&#151;a rather different persona from that of his later life. He suffered much ill health during this time and left Oxford in 1943 without taking a degree. He twice volunteered for military service, but on both occasions was rejected on grounds of his ill health. Instead he joined the BBC, at first as a recorded programmes assistant. On 27 November 1945 he married Joyce Elizabeth Waite, the 24-year-old daughter of Harold Dudden Waite, electrical engineer. They had one daughter, Carola. At the BBC Terraine was Pacific and southern African programme organizer for ten years from 1953, then from 1963 to 1964 associate producer and chief scriptwriter of the BBC series <span class="italic">The Great War</span>, widely recognized as a landmark in presenting history on television, and the fruit of Terraine's by now well-established interest in the First World War. In 1964 he left the BBC to become a freelance historian.<br>
<br>By the late 1950s, after much reading and thinking, Terraine had become dissatisfied with the simplistic but dominant view that the First World War was futile and British generalship incompetent. His campaign against these beliefs led to his becoming one of the most controversial and influential British military historians of the century. Terraine's thesis (first enunciated in book form in <span class="italic">Mons: the Retreat to Victory</span>, 1960) flew in the face of much received wisdom. He argued that the conditions on the western front meant that there could be no short cuts to victory. Industrialized warfare, the strength of the German army, and the lack of flanks to turn made an attritional strategy inevitable. The British army laboured under a number of handicaps. They were the junior partners in a coalition dominated by the French; the army of 1914 was small, focused on colonial warfare, and ill equipped; and a mass army had to be created and trained while participating in large-scale offensives. Yet in 1918 this army, under Haig's command, took the lead in defeating the Germans. In Terraine's view the attritional campaigns of 1916&#150;17, which wore down the German army, made this victory possible. Terraine had no doubt that Haig was a &#145;great captain&#146;. He pursued this basic theme, with variations, in more than half a dozen books and numerous articles, for more than thirty years. His most important book was <span class="italic">Douglas Haig: the Educated Soldier</span> (1963), a robust, well-argued, and (in contrast to some of his later writings) moderately phrased defence of the senior British commander on the western front. Other key texts included <span class="italic">The Road to Passchendaele</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">The Smoke and the Fire</span> (1980).<br>
<br>In spite of many challenges Terraine's thesis was never satisfactorily rebutted in his own lifetime. Many younger historians willingly acknowledged Terraine's influence on their thinking, and a modified version of his thesis underpinned the ideas of an increasingly influential revisionist school of military historians. However, there was general agreement among military historians that Terraine had claimed too much for the generalship of Douglas Haig. Terraine's importance lay also in the fact that he set out his ideas in popular and widely read books and articles and in television scripts, rather than in the obscurity of the monograph and seminar room, ensuring that in the field of public history there was an alternative to the dominant &#145;lions led by donkeys&#146; view of the First World War epitomized by Joan Littlewood's play <span class="italic">Oh What a Lovely War</span> and Alan Clark's book <span class="italic">The Donkeys</span>. His role as founder president of the Western Front Association (1980&#150;97), an organization with thousands of members, further spread his influence.<br>
<br>Inevitably Terraine's books on the First World War overshadowed the rest of his literary output, but he also wrote books on subjects as diverse as the battle of Trafalgar and Lord Mountbatten, and his articles ranged wider still. Many readers considered his work on the RAF in the Second World War, <span class="italic">The Right of the Line</span> (1985), to be his finest book. He also continued his distinguished broadcasting career. He was a skilled scriptwriter who understood both radio and television. Among other series and programmes he was scriptwriter of <span class="italic">The Life and Times of Lord Mountbatten</span> (Rediffusion/Thames TV, 1966&#150;8) and <span class="italic">The Mighty Continent</span> (BBC, 1974&#150;5), an acclaimed television history of twentieth-century Europe. For the former he interviewed Mountbatten many times, and was struck by his &#145;curious mix of boastfulness and diffidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>).<br>
<br>Terraine was sensitive to unfriendly reviews and personal criticism but he doggedly stuck to what he believed to be true, despite the unfashionable nature of his cause, and the hostility he aroused. He was essentially an outsider, never part of the military history establishment, although in 1986 he became an honorary fellow of Keble College, Oxford. His long association with the Royal United Services Institute, of which he was a council member (1976&#150;84), and whose Chesney gold medal he received in 1982, was in some respects a substitute. He rather uneasily straddled the divide between &#145;academic&#146; and &#145;popular&#146; history, although in the last decades of his life he was touched by the admiration of a younger generation of academic historians. He could appear prickly and dogmatic in public, but he was a kind man with many friends. In <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> he listed his recreation as &#145;convivial and congenial conversation&#146;. Often this took place in a pub. He and his wife, Joyce, separated in the late 1960s, but in later years he found a devoted partner in Katherine Rose (Kathy) Stevenson, who helped him organize the Western Front Association, and who nursed him through a long illness. He died on 28 December 2003 at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, Westminster, of pneumonia. He was survived by Kathy Stevenson and by his daughter, Carola, also a historian. He had been a keen birdwatcher, and his ashes were scattered at Pagham harbour nature reserve.<br>
