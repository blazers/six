<span class="headword">Pickering, Sir  Gilbert</span>, first baronet, appointed Lord Pickering under the protectorate  (1611&#150;1668), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 10 March 1611, the eldest son of Sir John Pickering of Titchmarsh, Northamptonshire (<i>d</i>. 1628), and his wife, Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1661), daughter of Sir Erasmus Dryden. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22210/', "John Pickering (d. 1645)")</script> was a younger brother. Gilbert Pickering was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, at Easter 1625 and graduated BA in 1629; he entered Gray's Inn in November 1629. On 15 May 1638 he married Elizabeth Montague, or Mountagu (<i>d</i>. 1679), daughter of Sir Sidney Montague, master of requests; there were eight sons and four daughters of the marriage. He was made a baronet of Nova Scotia that June, and sat in the Short and Long parliaments for the county Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Supporting parliament in 1642 Pickering joined the Northamptonshire committee, raised a regiment, and was involved in levying the assessment, but was most active on the committee for sequestration and was later remembered as &#145;a sequester and a committee man&#146;. A Northamptonshire clergyman later called him &#145;first a Presbyterian, then an Independent, then a Brownist, and afterwards an Anabaptist; a most fiery, furious, implacable man; was the principal agent in casting out most of the learned clergy&#146;  (Walker). A friend and ally of Cromwell, he helped to negotiate the surrender of Bristol but took little part in the post-war crises. He was not excluded at Pride's Purge, and was appointed a regicide judge but attended only two sittings of the court and did not sign Charles's death warrant. He also refused to sign the engagement in February 1649, and was unable to take up a seat on the council of state as a result, though he sat on all subsequent councils.<br>
<br>One of the parliamentary delegation to greet Cromwell on his return from his victory at Worcester in 1651, Pickering was a teller in favour of the abolition of tithes, helped to revive debate on the propagation of the gospel, and to set up the Hale commission on law reform, and was chosen to supervise the government tapestry factory at Mortlake. His increasing pretensions are indicated by his lease of a prime site in Whitehall in 1650 to erect his London residence, Pickering House. He took no part in the fall of the Rump but was soon approached for advice on its replacement and was re-elected to the Nominated Parliament for Northamptonshire. Generally moderate he voted against immediate abolition of tithes but favoured banning Christmas. One of the committee to negotiate with the Dutch ambassadors, on 27 July he joined the council of state's committee for foreign affairs. Popular enough in parliament to take second place to Cromwell in its elections to the council on 1 November, he subsequently joined Lambert's group planning the assembly's early dissolution and put his name to the successful motion requesting its closure.<br>
<br>Pickering was a natural choice to join Cromwell's protectorate council of state, on which he took a leading role. He helped to frame the ordinance to establish the triers and ejectors, but opposed prosecuting recusants for their &#145;bare opinion&#146;. Regarding Quakers &#145;as infectious as the plague&#146;, he none the less refused to be vindictive to James Nayler and warned parliament &#145;I hope there is none here but desires [his] repentance rather than his ruin.&#146; He again took a role in foreign affairs, supporting an alliance with France in order to succour the Huguenots and halt French aid to the royalists. As an opponent of a Spanish alliance he was chosen on 4 April 1654 for the committee to negotiate with their ambassador, Cardenas, but was also told to deliver to the French the unpalatable request for the surrender of Dunkirk as part of the terms for an alliance. After the peace treaty with France he was spoken of as a possible ambassador but was not appointed, possibly as too sympathetic. Significantly, on 28 January 1656 he was chosen to help negotiate with Sweden despite preferring an alliance with their commercially more useful Dutch rivals. For whatever reason he took no part in the subsequent talks. He was also on the council for trade (12 July 1655) and a multitude of council committees, including those for the plantations.<br>
<br>Pickering was elected to the 1656 parliament for Northamptonshire after blatant intimidation of the assembled freeholders on Kettering Heath by Major-General Boteler, and was summoned to the upper house in December 1657. His most visible role was in the ceremonial office of lord chamberlain, to which he was appointed on 12 August 1655 but was mainly active from October 1657. Jeered at by a republican as &#145;so finical, spruce, and like an old courtier&#146;, he gave employment to his nephew, the poet John Dryden, and organized accommodation for visiting ambassadors and the imprisoned Nayler. In attendance at Cromwell's death and his son and successor Richard's proclamation, he walked immediately before the hearse at the state funeral on 23 November 1658. He supported the army officers rather than most of his civilian colleagues against Richard Cromwell. With the fall of the protectorate Pickering rejoined the restored Rump Parliament. When, within months, it was in turn expelled by the army he was, in October 1659, appointed to the committee of safety established by the military.<br>
<br>Opposing the Restoration, Pickering was originally marked for exclusion from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>. However, as recorded by Pepys, he used the influence of his brother-in-law Edward Montague, commander of the fleet, whom he had assisted under Cromwell, to secure his pardon. Banned from office for life Pickering retired to Northamptonshire, but he was still obstinate enough to resist forcibly the return of the former royalist incumbent, Henry Deane, to the parish of Titchmarsh. Deane accused him of having demolished part of the vicarage for obstructing his view and seizing tithes; Lady Pickering refused Deane his keys. Subsequently, &#145;with an Amazonian courage&#146;, she induced her servants to break into the vicarage. Pickering escaped any punishment, and died at Titchmarsh at Michaelmas 1668 after what Pepys described as a &#145;long lethargy&#146;. He was buried on 17 October in Titchmarsh church, where his son Sir John Pickering erected a monument in 1698. A capable administrator, passionate in religion and high-handed in local affairs, his integrity was commended by Cromwell as &#145;honest Pickering&#146;  (O. Cromwell to O. St John, 1 Sept 1648, quoted in O. Cromwell <span class="italic">Writings and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</span>, ed. W. C. Abbott, 1937, 2.645).<br>
