<span class="headword">Wilkins,  David</span>  (1685&#150;1745), <span class="occ">Coptic scholar</span>, was born of Prussian parentage in Memel, Lithuania, on 11 June 1685. His original name was Wilke, which he Latinized as Wilkius and Anglicized into Wilkins. Little is known about his education in Germany (probably in Berlin) or how he acquired his knowledge of ancient and Semitic languages, which was extensive rather than profound. He referred to the antiquarian Ezechiel Spanheim, the elector of Brandenburg's ambassador in England from 1701 to 1710, as his former teacher  (Wilkins, 92). By 1707 Wilkins was studying at the Bodleian Library in Oxford and had encountered a group of clerical protectors in London. In 1709, engaged in preparing a history of the patriarchs of Alexandria (which remained in manuscript) and the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Coptic (Bohairic) <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, the <span class="italic">Novum Testamentum Aegyptium</span> (1716), he left for the continent. He called on scholars, examined manuscripts in Vienna, Rome, and Paris, and stopped in Amsterdam in 1714 to see to the publication of his first works&#151;an edition of the Aramaic paraphrasis of the books of <span class="roman">Chronicles</span> and an Armenian version of the apocryphal third epistle to the <span class="roman">Corinthians</span> (1715)&#151;and of John Chamberlayne's polyglot edition of the Lord's prayer, to which he contributed.<br>
<br>By then Wilkins was a well-known figure in the republic of letters, acquainted with the French orientalist in Berlin, Mathurin Veyssi&egrave;re de Lacroze, and in correspondence with numerous European intellectuals who shared his interest in languages and the early church. In England his reception was mixed. Oxford refused him an MA (23 May 1712), but he was created DD at Cambridge in October 1717, and in 1724 was appointed lord almoner's reader of Arabic, a post he resigned in 1729. He was elected FSA on 13 January 1720.<br>
<br>Like one of his first patrons, John Ernest Grabe, another Prussian immigrant, Wilkins converted to Anglicanism. His main patron was William Wake, archbishop of Canterbury. After employing him for some years as an amanuensis, Wake made him librarian at Lambeth Palace in 1715, and gave him the Kentish rectories of Mongeham Parva (30 April 1716) and Great Chart (12 September 1719). Wilkins resigned them both on obtaining the rectories of Hadleigh and Monks Eleigh in Suffolk in November 1719, and the place of joint commissary of the archiepiscopal deanery of Bocking in Essex. On 21 November 1719 he became Wake's domestic chaplain. He acquired the twelfth prebend in the church of Canterbury on 26 January 1721 and on 19 December 1724 the archdeaconry of Suffolk.<br>
<br>Wilkins was an industrious scholar. In the three years he spent as librarian at Lambeth he made important contributions to the cataloguing of manuscripts. In 1721 he edited the Anglo-Saxon laws, in 1725&#150;6 the complete works of John Selden, and in 1731 the Coptic <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>. His main work was his <span class="italic">Concilia Magnae Britanniae et Hiberniae</span>, an account of British church councils from 446 to 1717 (4 vols., 1737).<br>
<br>The quality of Wilkins's output was uneven. He was primarily a copyist and a compiler, often lacking thoroughness and discrimination. His edition of Selden is careless, but credit must be given to his diligence in assembling unpublished material. Despite his assurance to Lacroze that he read Coptic as easily as Latin  (<span class="italic">Thesaurus epistolicus Lacrozianus</span>, 1.376), his Bohairic <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, as Lacroze himself observed  (ibid., 3.97, 154&#150;61), betrays an inadequate familiarity with the language and suffers from an arbitrary use of different manuscripts with no indication which they are. His <span class="italic">Concilia</span> was indebted to Henry Spelman and Thomas Tanner, and still more to Wake. It can be criticized for the mistakes in Anglo-Saxon, the use of inferior manuscripts, and the treatment of chronology, but remains a formidable achievement and has provided the basis for much later work.<br>
<br>Wilkins had many detractors&#151;John Gagnier, the professor of Arabic at Oxford, who deplored his incompetence in Arabic and Hebrew  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.50, 11.296), Edward Harley, who described him as &#145;a very great scoundrel&#146;  (Yoewell, 420), and the cantankerous Thomas Hearne, who, as librarian at the Bodleian, had watched him turn from a young man &#145;of a civil, Courteous and modest behaviour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.108) into &#145;a vain ambitious man, of little judgement, tho' great industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 11.115), ready to &#145;do anything in the World for a little Money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 7.283). Wilkins's pomposity emerges from his portrait and his correspondence, and suspicions of his mercenary nature were strengthened by his marriage on 15 November 1725 to Margaret (<i>c</i>.1692&#150;1750), the half-witted eldest daughter of Thomas, fifth Lord Fairfax, of Leeds Castle, Kent, with a dowry of &pound;4000. Yet there was another side to Wilkins. He had loyal friends, and behaved generously to the son of Bishop Tanner, whose offer of &pound;50 for copying out his father's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Britannica</span> he refused to accept before the book was published. Wilkins had no children. He died of gout at Hadleigh on 6 September 1745, leaving his wife as his sole heir. He was buried in the chancel of Hadleigh church.<br>
