</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Owen,  Robert</span>  (1771&#150;1858), <span class="occ">socialist and philanthropist</span>, was born on 14 May 1771 at Newtown, Montgomeryshire, the son of Robert Owen (1741&#150;1804), a saddler and ironmonger as well as the local postmaster, and his wife, Anne Williams (<i>c</i>.1735&#150;1803), a farmer's daughter. He was the youngest, but one, of seven children, and his childhood seems to have been a happy one. Intellectually precocious, he devoured a book per day, including novels, histories, and travel books, and became the schoolmaster's assistant. As a producer of pious sermons, he was known as &#145;the little parson&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 4.54). At the age of ten, however, as he later claimed in his somewhat teleological autobiography, <span class="italic">The Life of Robert Owen</span>, he underwent a religious crisis, concluding that &#145;there must be something fundamentally wrong in all religions, as they had been taught up to that period&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 4.54). Religious scepticism was to become a dominant theme in his later life.<br>
<br>Anxious to leave home, Owen was permitted in 1781 to become apprenticed to James McGuffog, a cloth merchant in Stamford, Lincolnshire, who specialized in well-to-do ladies' wear. Having learned much about fabric and the trade, in 1784 Owen joined a London retailer, working twelve hours daily for &pound;25 p.a., and then moved to a similar position at &pound;40 p.a. under John Satterfield in Manchester. Here Owen soon became curious about the new machinery being applied to cotton spinning. Borrowing &pound;100 from his brother William, he entered into a partnership with a machine-maker named Jones constructing &#145;mules&#146; for making thread, and soon the firm of Jones and Owen had forty employees. When he was bought out in 1789&#150;90, his old master, McGuffog, offered him half the profits in his shop. Owen chose instead in April 1792&#151;not in 1790, as the <span class="italic">Life</span> states  (<span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.32)&#151;to manage a mill with 500 employees owned by Peter Drinkwater, who had first applied the Boulton and Watt engine to cotton spinning in Manchester. Despite his inexperience, Owen applied himself rigorously, spending six weeks studying the factory, and proposing many refinements to the manufacturing process. Soon the quality of his thread was renowned.<h2>
<a name="NewLanark"></a>New Lanark</h2>It was at this time that Owen, who as yet had few political opinions to speak of (though he signed a loyalist address with other Manchester manufacturers in 1795, during the war with France), became concerned with the moral and physical condition of his workforce. He began to apply the principle which was to dominate most of his life, the environmentalist dogma that character was derived from &#145;circumstances&#146; rather than created by the will. This did not at this stage inhibit his success as it was later to do. He accepted a partnership with Drinkwater's sons, but then characteristically renounced it, without complaint, in order to allow Drinkwater's son-in-law, the manufacturer Samuel Oldknow, greater control in the firm. He joined the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society on 1 November 1793, and here met philanthropically inclined physicians like Samuel Bardsley. Here, too, he read at least two papers, now lost: &#145;On the origin of opinions with a view to the improvement of the social virtues&#146; and &#145;Thoughts on the connection between universal happiness and practical mechanics&#146;. Shy and sensitive among strangers, speaking a kind of Welsh English, Owen here began to acquire social grace.<br>
<br>On a business visit to Glasgow, Owen met Ann Caroline Dale (1779&#150;1831), the daughter of a prominent cotton spinner, David Dale (1739&#150;1806), who had started as a Paisley weaver, and in 1785 with Richard Arkwright had built a mill at New Lanark south of Glasgow. Owen first visited the site on 15 June 1798, and was impressed both with its delightful location and with Dale's pioneering efforts to improve his labourers' working and living conditions. He married Caroline Dale on 30 September 1799 at Dale's palatial house on Charlotte Street, Glasgow. In the same year Owen acquired the New Lanark mills with several partners for &pound;60,000, and he moved there on 1 January 1800 to take the post of manager of the New Lanark Twist Company, with a ninth share in the profits. When Dale died in 1806, Owen formed a new partnership (another would follow in 1810, following resistance to his experiments) which returned him about 40 per cent of the profits, averaging 12&frac12; per cent p.a. Eventually he was to share in approximately &pound;300,000 from the mill. He had tremendous drive and energy, was adept at handling both his partners and business associates, and was scrupulously honest in his dealings. Skilled as both manager and entrepreneur, he typified the early self-made capitalists of the era.<br>
<br>Owen evidently set out to make New Lanark an experiment in philanthropic management from the outset. He was not yet a &#145;socialist&#146; (the term was not coined until the mid-1820s) and advocated neither profit-sharing nor the elimination of &#145;competition&#146; at the mills. Instead, he sought to reduce both vice and punishment while improving living and working conditions, expecting in return an increase in output from the workforce.<h2>
<a name="Philanthropicmanagement"></a>Philanthropic management</h2>Despite initial resistance from his workers and continuing suspicion from his partners, especially from the pious Quaker philanthropist William Allen, Owen was remarkably successful in all these areas. Some 1800 people were employed at the mill, including about 500 pauper children sent by various parishes. Their working day was reduced by Owen in 1816 from eleven and three-quarter hours to ten and three-quarter hours. Shoddy and expensive goods in the company store were replaced with better ones at wholesale prices. Owen aimed to reduce living costs still further with plans (never realized) to introduce communal cooking and eating arrangements. His efforts at infant education&#151;of which he is rightly regarded as among the founders&#151;culminated in the opening of the Institute for the Formation of Character in 1816, where dancing, singing, and other lessons were taught. At the institute Owen, who taught military tactics himself, sought in particular to exclude punishment from education, to make learning interesting to young minds, and to encourage children to believe their own happiness to be dependent on that of others. In the workplace he installed &#145;silent monitors&#146;&#151;multi-coloured blocks of wood which rotated above each labourer's workplace; the different coloured sides reflected the achievements of each worker, from black denoting poor performance to white denoting excellence. Employees with illegitimate children were fined. Pilfering and absenteeism were reduced. One-sixtieth of wages was set aside for sickness, injury, and old age. In the village surrounding the factory, groups of houses were organized as &#145;neighbourhood divisions&#146;, of which heads of households annually chose a &#145;principal&#146;. These elected twelve &#145;jurors&#146; to sit monthly for one year, hearing and judging cases respecting the internal order of the community.<br>
<br>All resistance to these schemes was finally broken when, in 1806, Owen continued to pay full wages during an American cotton embargo. By 1816 New Lanark, often termed &#145;the happy valley&#146;, was renowned throughout Europe, and was deluged with visitors (over 20,000 between 1815 and 1825) curious to see how Owen had combined high profits with philanthropy. Owen, however, could not rest satisfied, and moreover met increasing resistance from his partners. In 1813, avoiding a hostile take-over effort on their part, Owen secretly raised enough capital to outbid his partners at a public auction of New Lanark. Now he formed a new partnership composed of the Baptist physician and philanthropist Joseph Fox, a former fishmonger and future lord mayor of London, Michael Gibbs, William Allen, two other Quakers, Joseph Foster and John Walker, and the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, for whom it was a rare profitable venture. Owen found Allen's objections to his own views on religion irksome, as they clearly had a bearing on the educational ideas he first presented in <span class="italic">A New View of Society, or, Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character</span> (1813&#150;14). Here, in what remains his best-known work, Owen demanded a system of national education to prevent idleness, poverty, and crime among the &#145;lower orders&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, vol. 1), and recommended restricting &#145;gin shops and pot houses&#146;, the state lottery and gambling, as well as penal reform, ending the monopolistic position of the Church of England, and collecting statistics on the value and demand for labour throughout the country. Owen denied proposing &#145;that the British government should now give direct employment to all its working population&#146;. Instead, education should lead the poor &#145;to find employment sufficient to support themselves, except in cases of great sudden depression in the demand for, and consequent depreciation in the value of, labour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.97). To ensure the primacy of private enterprise, public labour on roads, docks, and shipbuilding would be paid less than the average local wage. There was nothing socialistic in these proposals, and it is hardly the case, as Leslie Stephen erroneously assumed  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), that Owen's &#145;essential views&#146; were encapsulated here.<br>
<br>Instead Owen attracted widespread support from philanthropists and even, despite his growing reputation for anti-clericalism, from church officials. His ideas might have been swallowed up in the plethora of poor-law reform proposals of the immediate post-war period. But Owen possessed the supreme confidence of the self-made man. Animated by opposition, especially when his early efforts to pass a factory reform bill faltered, his views became more extreme. Between 1813 and 1818 Owen made about fifty visits to the philosophical anarchist and religious sceptic William Godwin, whose <span class="italic">Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</span> (1793) had caused a great stir during the revolutionary debates a generation earlier, and who shared Owen's environmentalist faith in the principles of &#145;necessity&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Solvingnationalpoverty"></a>Solving national poverty</h2>From 1814 Owen had a relatively free hand to pursue his ideals at New Lanark. But his eye was already on the growing problem of national poverty. In 1816 Owen announced that &#145;the chief object&#146; of his existence would be to make &#145;universal&#146; the results of his experiments with the character of the labouring classes. Crucially, he now also insisted that the new manufacturing process be &#145;gradually diminished&#146;, and that Britain aim for greater self-sufficiency in food  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.126). In <span class="italic">Observations on the Effects of the Manufacturing System</span> (1815) he identified for the first time: &#145;immediate pecuniary gain, to which on the great scale every other [principle] is made to give way&#146; as the &#145;governing principle of trade, manufactures, and commerce&#146;. &#145;Buying cheap and selling dear&#146;, and the &#145;spirit of competition&#146;, which had made Owen rich, were now vilified as the moral cause of the excesses of industrialization. The factory system, moreover, bred &#145;a new character in its inhabitants &hellip; formed upon a principle quite unfavourable to individual or general happiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.112&#150;13). Machinery should be introduced &#145;only in aid of, and not in competition with, human labour&#146;, in order to reduce the hours of work required to secure a decent living  (ibid., 1.154). But technical innovation, as Owen later stressed, was possible &#145;in every department&#146;, so that each community might have &#145;a full supply of the best machinery&#146;  (Owen, <span class="italic">The Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race</span>, 1849, 45). (This contradicts David Ricardo's charge that Owen opposed all machinery, which was obviously calculated to bracket him with the Luddites.)<br>
<br>The experiment at New Lanark was to be the germ from which would spring model industrial townships to combat both the growing immorality fostered by industry as well as the more immediately pressing issues of unemployment and hunger. Moreover, Owen was persuaded increasingly that labour, rather than capital, essentially created wealth. In these communities, therefore, economic justice could also be attained. Moreover, not only the poor, but &#145;every class in society&#146; who wished to join would soon be able to escape &#145;intemperance, disease, and suffering&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.219). These &#145;villages of union&#146; of 500 to 1500 people united by &#145;mutual and combined interest&#146; would be situated in the countryside, but would have some machinery of their own (shown steaming away in the background in early illustrations). Thus they could be largely self-sufficient. Ideally, he thought, communities should be constructed in the form of a large quadrangle, with public buildings in the centre. Persons of a particular political or religious persuasion might want to associate with others of their kind, and Owen designed a table showing 140 combinations of such views. Each community could start with as little as &pound;60,000, which the government would, he hoped, provide, though if private capital were necessary a 5 per cent return was thought likely.<h2>
<a name="Owenassocialist"></a>Owen as socialist</h2>The year 1817 was the turning point in the conversion of Owen the philanthropic &#145;prince of the cotton-spinners&#146; to Owen the socialist. Much of his time was now spent in London attempting, with the assistance of the elder Sir Robert Peel, himself a cotton lord, to get a bill regulating the employment of children approved by a select committee of parliament. This sought to prohibit employment before the age of ten; to reduce hours of labour to ten and a half per day (in 1818, he proposed ten hours); and to require a minimal education to begin work. These regulations he wished to apply to all manufactories. Owen met the committee five times, first embarking on a tour of the factory districts with his eldest son. Conditions were worse than he had feared. As many as a quarter of the children he saw suffered from work-related injuries or deformities, which were well documented by some of the physicians Owen had first met at the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. His first substantial economic tract, <span class="italic">Observations on the Cotton Trade and on the Late Duties on the Importation of Cotton Wool</span> (1803), had argued against new duties on raw cotton imports passed by parliament, holding that these would undermine Britain's advantage over growing foreign competition. But Owen, outraged, now declared, &#145;perish the cotton trade, perish even the political superiority of our country (if it depend on the cotton trade), rather than they shall be upheld by the sacrifice of everything valuable in life by those who are the means of supporting them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.105&#150;6). Most of Owen's fellow manufacturers disagreed strenuously with any restriction beyond the twelve hours per day limit for workhouse apprentices established by Peel's 1802 act. When another parliamentary select committee met to consider poor-law reform, it refused to his deep disappointment even to take his evidence. Increasingly frustrated, Owen suspected that the clergy were at the root of opposition to his plan.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1817 Owen bombarded the newspapers with letters about his proposals, and bought thousands of copies when they printed his appeals, spending some &pound;4000 in two months and on one occasion delaying the departure of the London mail coaches by twenty minutes. His ideas about how to solve the problem of poverty had clearly shifted quite dramatically. In July he discussed &#145;the principle of united labour and expenditure&#146; as applied to a &#145;community of mutual and combined interests&#146;, which by implication included a community of goods. Still, he claimed that communities might produce only &#145;to the amount of their own immediate wants; and constituted as they will be, they can have no motives to produce an unnecessary surplus&#146;. In the long run, however, when the &#145;true interests&#146; of society were clarified, they would be permitted &#145;gradually to supersede the others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.160&#150;65).<br>
<br>Owen's determination to publicize these conclusions to the entire nation reached a peak in two remarkable public meetings in 1817. On 14 August he addressed an audience of many hundreds at the City of London tavern. Prominent members of the clergy and government were present, as well as political economists and many of the leaders of London plebeian radicalism. The radicals attended chiefly to assail what they saw as a paternalistic plot to &#145;turn the country into a workhouse&#146; or &#145;pauper barracks&#146; and &#145;rear up a community of slaves&#146; (in the words of Robert Wedderburn, himself the son of a slave; <span class="italic">Black Dwarf</span>, 20 Aug 1817, 469). Owen's plans omitted any demand for parliamentary reform and reduced taxation. Rumours abounded that the government was manipulating him in order to deflect working-class attention from political reform, and that Owen himself actually wished, as W. T. Sherwin had suggested in the spring, to deprive the working classes of their political rights. At the 14 August meeting, the radical leader Henry Hunt thus moved to amend Owen's proposals so as to portray excessive taxation as the root of pauperism. The whig political economists present also desired to see Owen defeated, since he was increasingly reputed to oppose both free trade and machinery. (Ricardo was later to state that he was &#145;completely at war with Mr. Owen&#146;; <span class="italic">Wooler's British Gazette</span>, 19 Dec 1819, 412.) Their representative, Major Robert Torrens (1780&#150;1864), thus complained at length that Malthus's population doctrines had long since invalidated all but the harshest regimes of poor relief. At the second meeting, on 21 August, Owen insisted against his radical critics that lowering taxes would only add those who lived from public spending to the ranks of the unemployed. Instead, he sought to persuade them that increasing mechanization was a far more fundamental source of distress. Most astonishingly, however, Owen for a few minutes then rounded on all teachers of religion as having made man &#145;a weak, imbecile animal; a furious bigot and fanatic; or a miserable hypocrite&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.207). His audience, Owen later recalled, was &#145;thunderstruck&#146;  (ibid., vol. 4, 216). A few clergymen hissed. But &#145;the loudest cheers&#146; then erupted in praise of what <span class="italic">The Observer</span> politely described as Owen's condemnation of the &#145;vices of existing religious establishments&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 24 Aug 1817, 4). None the less this support was insufficient to win over his audience, and Owen's proposals were dismissed as impracticable at the end of the meeting &#145;by a great majority&#146; present, on a vote introduced by the London radical Robert Waithman.<h2>
<a name="Thevalueoflabour"></a>The value of labour</h2>In 1817 Owen began to speak the language of the millennium, and to cast himself in the role of a prophet both of a secular apocalypse, &#145;the crisis&#146;, and, in his mind's eye, of the &#145;new moral world&#146; or &#145;millennial world&#146; which would succeed it, where laws, commerce, religion, war, and self-interest would disappear. He had already suggested in 1813, but now began loudly to proclaim, closely following Paul's letter to the <span class="roman">Corinthians</span>, that charity was the core of all religion, and the highest good any individual could attain. Owen's object, thus, was no longer solely &#145;the relief of the poor&#146;, but now, far more importantly, &#145;the emancipation of mankind&#146;. Unfortunately his reputation in respectable circles was greatly damaged by the events of August 1817. Clerics aimed broadsides at him, and in a new edition of Malthus's <span class="italic">Essay on Population</span>, first published in 1798, he became a key target, supplanting Godwin and Condorcet.<br>
<br>Yet Owen still continued to court the famous and influential. Stopping at the post-war congress of the great powers at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, he distributed a pamphlet written for the occasion to many European leaders (failing, however, to press one into the hands of the tsar, who had no pocket large enough for the bulky octavo, and dismissed Owen so gruffly that he did not try again). At dinner, he sat next to Metternich's associate Friedrich Gentz, who complained, in response to Owen's remonstrances, that &#145;we do not want the mass to become wealthy and independent of us. How could we govern them if they were?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 4.238). Much of the period 1818&#150;20 he spent in London, chiefly at the house of John Walker at 49 Bedford Square, meeting, among others, his principal patron, the duke of Kent, father of the future Queen Victoria, who chaired meetings in 1819 of a newly formed society to further his plans, but then died suddenly in 1820.<br>
<br>At the invitation of a group of Lanarkshire notables, Owen in 1820 also composed one of his most important works, the <span class="italic">Report to the County of Lanark</span> (1821). Partly in reaction to a great commercial crisis in 1819, this suggested that in order to avoid fluctuations in the money supply as well as the payment of unjust wages, labour notes representing hours of work might become a superior form of exchange medium. Here Owen first proclaimed at length his belief that labour was the foundation of all value, a principle of immense importance to later socialist thought. The <span class="italic">Report</span> also offered a novel account of the relationship between money and the expansion and contraction of the market. Previously Owen had argued that mechanization at a time of reduced demand depressed wages in many industries. Now, denying the market's ability to find a natural equilibrium, Owen stressed the under-consumptionist aspects of productive capacity, and the failure to find &#145;a market, or means of exchange, co-extensive with the means of production&#146;. The use of gold and silver created &#145;a mere artificial standard&#146; of value which &#145;retarded the general improvement of society&#146; because it was too dependent on the value and supply of metals. Hence after the gold standard had been reintroduced amid fierce debate in 1819, the resulting deflation and depression had &#145;plunged the country into poverty, discontent, and danger&#146;. The <span class="italic">Report</span> also first explicitly stated Owen's intention of beginning upon &#145;the principle of united labour, expenditure, and property, and equal privileges&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.289&#150;90, 305). For this reason, in particular, it is sometimes regarded as marking the origins of modern socialism. Owen explicitly condemned the &#145;principle of individual interest&#146;, or the idea:<blockquote>that man can provide better for himself, and more advantageously for the public, when left to his own individual exertions, opposed to and in competition with his fellows, than when aided by any social arrangement which shall unite his interests individually and generally with society.</blockquote>The existing divisions within society, he asserted, were &#145;the most anti-social, impolitic, and irrational, that can be devised&#146;. Against Adam Smith, Owen particularly insisted that further specialization within production would only harm the working classes. Private interests were &#145;placed perpetually at variance with the public good; and in every nation men are purposely trained from infancy to suppose that their well-being is incompatible with the progress and prosperity of other nations&#146;. The new system, however, would combine &#145;extensive mental and manual powers in the individuals of the working classes [and] a complete identity of private and public interest&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Works</span>, 1.308&#150;9).<br>
<br>In May 1822 Owen formed the British and Foreign Philanthropic Society to raise funds for a community, but soon discovered that many of its illustrious members (who included MPs, generals, and bankers) had more limited aims in mind. He journeyed to Ireland in 1822&#150;3 to examine conditions there, speaking for three hours in Dublin to a large meeting which included the lord mayor and several nobles. At this time, his emphasis was somewhat more upon the agricultural basis of communities (as elsewhere pastoral imagery occasionally loomed large in Owenism).<h2>
<a name="NewHarmony"></a>New Harmony</h2>In the second half of the 1820s Owen's energies focused on the prospect of building a community in America. In 1825 he purchased from a Pietist German &eacute;migr&eacute; sect, the Rappites, a ready-built township set on 20,000 acres at New Harmony in southern Indiana. Unfortunately the establishment soon became an enormous drain on his resources. In a short time Owen spent about &pound;40,000, or four-fifths of his New Lanark fortune (his interest in the mills was finally sold in 1828), in a fruitless effort to organize the disparate group of 800 radicals, freethinkers, backwoodsmen, and scientists who had no desire to be &#145;governed&#146; like mill hands. In early 1825 he addressed the president, senate, and supreme court at the house of representatives in Washington, DC.<br>
<br>New Harmony was briefly the most vibrant and sophisticated cultural outpost on the American frontier. But centrifugal tendencies tore at the community from the beginning, and by late 1827 the experiment was in the final stages of dissolution, with its half-dozen projected imitators elsewhere following close behind. In 1828 the opportunity arose of securing a very substantial land grant from the Mexican government to settle the Texan frontier with the United States. Owen first paused at Cincinnati for an eight-day public debate about religion to an audience of a thousand. Then he sailed to Vera Cruz via Jamaica, but failed ultimately to secure a grant of land.<br>
<br>On his return to Britain, Owen found that a consumer co-operative society indebted to his ideas had been started in Edinburgh by an inspired tanner named Abram Combe (1785&#150;1827), who had also begun plans for a community modelled on Owen's ideals, at Orbiston, south of Glasgow. By 1830, moreover, some 300 co-operative societies had sprung up across the country. Owen found his ideas developed by economists like William Thompson (1775&#150;1833) and John Gray (1799&#150;1883). Cast once again into relative obscurity when he began to lecture in London in 1830, Owen found that his secularism was the main appeal to his small audiences. In 1830&#150;32 he continued to oppose radical political reform, as insufficient to meet the economic evils of society. By 1832&#150;3, however, he had emerged as the leader of several &#145;labour exchanges&#146;, notably at Gray's Inn Road, London, and at Birmingham, where artisans could exchange goods directly without the intercession of middlemen. The culmination of his efforts in the early 1830s came with the formation of the first attempt to create a general union of all trades, the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union, which Owen helped to lead in 1833&#150;4, with the chief aim of achieving the eight-hour working day.<h2>
<a name="TheRationalSociety"></a>The Rational Society</h2>With the collapse of the union, however, ended Owen's always reluctant involvement with large-scale working-class organizations. In 1835, beginning what is usually termed the &#145;sectarian&#146; phase of the Owenite movement, he formed the Association of All Classes of All Nations, later renamed the Universal Community Society of Rational Religionists, or Rational Society for short. As a propaganda machine the association was remarkably effective: by 1839, the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> observed, Owen's antipathy to competition was seemingly &#145;the actual creed of a great portion of the working classes&#146;  (see <span class="italic">New Moral World</span>, 20 April 1839, 404). By 1840 the Rational Society boasted over 60 branches of self-styled &#145;socialists&#146; concentrated in the manufacturing districts, with perhaps 50,000 flocking to weekly lectures, among them the young German merchant Friedrich Engels, who first was instructed in the tenets of socialist political economy by the Manchester lecturer John Watts. The society's regular paper, the <span class="italic">New Moral World</span>, ran for nearly eleven years (1834&#150;45), and achieved a circulation of about 40,000 weekly at its peak (<i>c</i>.1839&#150;1841). In this period Owen composed his most extensive work, <span class="italic">The Book of the New Moral World</span> (7 pts, 1836&#150;44). Intellectual stature was lent to the movement by writers like Charles Bray and John Minter Morgan. The prime minister, Lord Melbourne, even presented Owen to the queen in 1839.<h2>
<a name="Queenwood"></a>Queenwood</h2>As &#145;Rational Social Father&#146; of his new organization, which was intended to bear some resemblance to a dissenting sect despite his earlier dismissal of the idea, Owen retained virtually complete control over its activities until late 1844. Of the considerable sums raised by the branches, much&#151;at least &pound;22,000 in 1839&#150;40 alone&#151;went towards constructing local &#145;halls of science&#146; where members attended lectures and held soir&eacute;es. In the meantime, however, the Rational Society had acquired land in Hampshire, erected buildings, and in late 1839 commenced a new community called Queenwood on a 533-acre site designed for 700 members. Owen's own vision of its creation as a symbol of his ideas also became steadily more grandiose and impractical. Much of the money collected for the community was spent on constructing, in 1842, an impressively large building with lavish fittings. Especially noteworthy was a model kitchen with a conveyor to carry food and dishes to and from the dining room which, its architect exulted, rivalled the amenities of any London hotel. This would have been a great achievement had Owen been a hotelier. Owen's defence was that the community was intended to be the standard for a superior socialist future where all would enjoy privileges the wealthy monopolized at present, nay even more, for all apartments were eventually to have central heating and cooling, hot and cold water, and artificial light. Its main building thus ought to be superior to any palace. By 1844, after over &pound;40,000 had been spent, Queenwood bankrupted the society.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Organized Owenism now ground to a halt. The branches broke up, with some emigrating <i>en masse</i> to the United States. Owen himself returned to America several times over the next few years. Although he failed in 1845 to address the senate again, he bombarded the government with addresses. In 1846 he helped (having met many of the principal negotiators in Mexico nearly twenty years earlier) to ease tensions between Britain and the USA over a border dispute in Oregon, crossing the Atlantic four times in fewer than six months in the effort. In 1848 Owen spent four months in revolutionary France to popularize his views, placarding the walls of Paris with broadsheets. The last decade of his life was dominated by his conversion to spiritualism in 1853. He died at the Bear's Head Hotel in Newtown on 17 November 1858, and was buried with his parents, next to, appropriately, the abandoned church of St Mary's, Newtown.<br>
<br>Robert Owen was survived by three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21028/', "Robert Dale Owen (1801&#150;1877)")</script>, David Dale Owen (1807&#150;1860), a prominent geologist, and Richard Owen (1810&#150;1890), also a geologist. His other children were William Dale Owen (1802&#150;1842), who became a merchant and bank director; Anne Caroline Owen (1805&#150;1830), who remained in Scotland and never married; Jane Dale Owen (1805&#150;1890), who married a civil engineer, Robert Fauntleroy, and settled at New Harmony; and Mary Owen (1810&#150;1832).<br>
<br>Physically, Owen was of athletic build, of middling height, with brown hair, later white and, in the later 1850s, accompanied by a full white beard (a specimen cutting of which is preserved in the Goldsmiths' Library, University of London). His boyish looks were preserved long in life. A benevolent demeanour, with kindly eyes and compelling smile, were often recorded by contemporaries.<h2>
<a name="ThereputationofRobertOwen"></a>The reputation of Robert Owen</h2>Though he was recognized as one of the greatest philanthropists of his day, Robert Owen was marginalized after the decline of Queenwood. Communitarian socialism was disregarded during the prosperous years from 1850 to 1875, and, overshadowed by the revolutionary Marxian socialism of the 1880s and later, never again became a serious alternative socialist vision. None the less Owen's reputation revived considerably between 1880 and 1900. Leading Marxists like William Morris and H. M. Hyndman (who referred to Owen in many of his works) acknowledged his seminal role in founding British socialism  (for example, Hyndman, <span class="italic">The Evolution of Revolution</span>, 1920, 270), and praised him as the &#145;noble and unselfish&#146; producer of &#145;some of the most luminous thoughts on political economy ever met on paper&#146;  (Hyndman, <span class="italic">The Historical Basis of Socialism in England</span>, 1883, 198, 85) and the originator of labour laws. This influence was also acknowledged by ideological enemies like W. H. Mallock  (for example, <span class="italic">The Limits of Pure Democracy</span>, 1918, 207&#150;10). Practically, Owen's impact was most substantial upon the theory of the growing co-operative movement. Following J. S. Mill's conversion to co-operation in the <span class="italic">Principles of Political Economy</span> (3rd edn, 1852), many Liberals acknowledged Owen's role in their foundation; Henry Fawcett, for instance, both doubted that the failure of Queenwood had greatly undermined the popularity of Owen's principles, and noted that many subsequent co-operatives had been managed by former Owenites  (Fawcett, <span class="italic">Essays and Lectures on Political and Social Subjects</span>, 1872, 11&#150;12). Despite their distaste for his secularism, Christian socialists also took up some of his views of the poor.<br>
<br>Owen's biographers all underestimated the importance and vitality of the Owenite movement of 1836&#150;45, which was first examined at length in J. F. C. Harrison's <span class="italic">Robert Owen and the Owenites</span> (1969). The claim is occasionally still heard that Owen was principally a &#145;scientific manager&#146;, but this view requires treating Owen's experiments at the New Lanark mills (now largely reconstructed) in isolation from his later life. More persuasively, it was argued already in Owen's lifetime  (first by William Hazlitt, in <span class="italic">Political Essays</span>, 1816, 97&#150;104) that Owen was a man of &#145;one idea&#146;, New Lanark, and his role in it. But the idea that character was formed by the environment and not the will&#151;perhaps the core assumption of the Enlightenment&#151;was in fact a fundamental one for modern thought, and was developed by Owen in many ways, though contemporaries found its endless repetition tedious. Owen's complete works comprise at least 160 titles, many of which are brief addresses. He also edited and contributed to many periodicals (a relatively complete bibliography is given in J. F. C. Harrison's <span class="italic">Robert Owen</span> (1969)).<br>
