<span class="headword">Pilcher, Sir  John Arthur</span>  (1912&#150;1990), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 16 May 1912 in Quetta, India, the only child of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur John Pilcher and his wife, Edith Blair. Both his parents shared a tradition of service in the Indian subcontinent in both the military and scholarly spheres, dating back to the eighteenth century. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Clare College, Cambridge. In 1932 he gained a second class (division I) in part one of the modern and medieval languages tripos and in 1935 a third class in part two. His formal studies were supplemented by travel in Europe.<br>
<br>In 1936 Pilcher was accepted as a student interpreter in the Japan consular service and was sent to Japan to learn the language. After one year in the embassy in Tokyo he went to study in the old capital of Kyoto, a city he grew to love. He lived for two years in the temple of Sokokuji and developed an appreciation of Japanese Buddhism. He also learned to speak the Kyoto dialect and got to know Kanjiro Kawai and other potters and artists.<br>
<br>In 1939 Pilcher was transferred to Tsingtao (Qingdao), a consular post in Japanese-occupied China. While there he was received into the Roman Catholic church. He returned to London in 1941 and worked mainly on Japanese affairs in the Ministry of Information and the Foreign Office. In 1942 he married Delia Margaret, daughter of Patrick Kirwan Taylor, a retired army officer who had been wounded in the First World War. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1948 Pilcher was appointed first secretary (information) in the British embassy in Rome. He was sorry to return to London in 1951 on promotion to counsellor. He became head of the Japan and Pacific department of the Foreign Office, where he saw through the ratification of the peace treaty, the Korean war, and the rather difficult period in Anglo-Japanese relations which followed the peace treaty. In 1954 he was appointed counsellor in Madrid and in 1959 received his first ambassadorial appointment in Manila, in the Philippines.<br>
<br>Pilcher returned to London in 1963 to become assistant under-secretary in charge of information and cultural work. In 1965 he was appointed ambassador to Austria, which proved to be a very happy posting. In addition to his knowledge and understanding of European culture he was an enthusiastic student of the Austro-German musical tradition. An accomplished pianist, he delighted in chamber music and accompanying singers and instrumentalists. In 1966 he was awarded the Austrian Grand Cross (gold) decoration of honour.<br>
<br>Pilcher was promoted to become ambassador in Tokyo in 1967. Having kept in touch with many of his pre-war Japanese friends, he was able to entertain widely on his return to Tokyo. He was assiduous in his contacts with the Japanese imperial family and accompanied the Showa emperor on the first Japanese state visit to London in 1971. On this occasion he was awarded the first class of the Japanese order of the Rising Sun. His period in Japan coincided with the successful British week in Tokyo in 1969, attended by Princess Margaret, and the Expo in Osaka in 1970, visited by the prince of Wales. Pilcher retired in 1972.<br>
<br>He had been brought up in the old school of diplomacy where the first priority was to cultivate influential people in the country to which an ambassador was accredited. He did this very well. He was also a knowledgeable and wise observer, his dispatches being well written and to the point. He disliked having to be a tough negotiator and protector of narrow British interests and also found modern commercial diplomacy rather distasteful. However, he invariably supported fully his staff in their endeavours to promote British exports and threw himself enthusiastically into the task of educating hard-headed British businessmen about the realities of modern Japan, recognizing that for this purpose they needed a modicum of understanding of Japanese culture and history.<br>
<br>Pilcher was an accomplished raconteur and wit. He had a fund of stories, many with a Rabelaisian twist, and could keep an audience enthralled for a long time. He was a short, tubby man, with a round, partly bald, head and a twinkle in his eyes. He was appointed CMG (1957), KCMG (1966), and GCMG (1973). In his retirement he became a director of the Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust (1973&#150;82), chairman of the Brazil Fund (1975&#150;82) and of the Fleming Japan Fund (1976&#150;85), and adviser on Far Eastern affairs to Robert Fleming &amp; Co. (1973&#150;85). Of great interest to him personally were his membership of the Museums and Galleries Commission (1973&#150;83) and of the committee of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (1974&#150;82), which he represented on the council of the National Trust. He was also president of the Institute of Linguists (1982&#150;4) and served twice (a total of six years) as chairman of the council of the Japan Society in Britain. He died on 10 February 1990 in Barnes, London, after a protracted illness. He was survived by his wife.<br>
