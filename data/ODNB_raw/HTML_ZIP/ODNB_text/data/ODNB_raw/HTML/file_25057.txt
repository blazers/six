<span class="headword">Seller,  Abednego</span>  (1646/7&#150;1705), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, was the son of Richard Seller, of Plymouth. He matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford, on 26 April 1662, aged fifteen. He did not take a degree, possibly because of poverty, but was ordained deacon on 11 March 1665 by Bishop Seth Ward of Exeter. He married Mary Persons on 2 December 1668 at Abbotsham, near Bideford, Devon. On 22 December 1672 he was ordained priest by Bishop Anthony Sparrow in Exeter Cathedral.<br>
<br>Seller's first publication appears to have been <span class="italic">An Infallible Way to Contentment</span> (1679). On 29 March 1682 he was installed as rector of Combeinteignhead, Devon, following presentation by Thomas Grey, earl of Stamford. While in that post he wrote <span class="italic">The Devout Communicant</span>. Published in 1686, it had reached its sixth edition by 1695 and it proved his most successful practical work, being republished with additions in 1704 as <span class="italic">The Good Man's Preparation for Receiving of the Blessed Sacrament</span>. Several other tracts of an anti-papist character followed. At this time Seller was also helping William Cave with his <span class="italic">Historia literaria</span> (1688). On 8 September 1686 Seller was installed vicar of St Charles, Plymouth. He did not appear at the bishop's visitation on 20 August 1689, but he still suffered deprivation for his failure to take the oaths to William and Mary.<br>
<br>Seller's response to the dilemma faced by the Church of England following the revolution of 1688 was to publish <span class="italic">The History of Passive Obedience</span> (1689). This argued against taking the oaths to the new monarchs, and brought forth refutations from divines such as Edward Stillingfleet. It was followed by <span class="italic">How far the clergy and other members of the Church of England ought to communicate with the non-swearing bishops</span> (1690), published anonymously, in which Seller's answer was an emphatic assertion that obedience was still owed to the nonjuring bishops, who had been deprived both schismatically and unlawfully. George Smalridge, the future bishop, wrote in November 1696 that &#145;Seller had the reputation of a scholar, though not of a good man, before he was a non-juror&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 3.253). In that year Seller had published <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Palmyra</span>. In January 1700 Narcissus Luttrell reported that a fire in Red Lion Square had burnt down Mr Knightley's house where Seller's library &#145;with a great number of choice and scarce manuscripts were consumed&#146;  (Luttrell, 4.605).<br>
<br>Seller was resident in St Andrew's, Holborn, Middlesex, when he wrote his will on 9 July 1704. He left his manuscript of William of Malmesbury's &#145;De gestis pontificum&#146; to the Bodleian Library; his Byzantine histories to Lincoln College; and a manuscript written by Lord Herbert to John Woodward, professor of physic at Gresham College. His other main concern was the maintenance and education of his two younger grandchildren, the daughters of his deceased daughter Margaret Bowen. The eldest granddaughter was to be placed with her uncle, Matthew Bowen. His wife received &pound;20. In a codicil of 9 March 1705 he ordered &#145;all my papers, sermons, adversaria and manuscripts (except such manuscripts as are fairly transcribed from other copies) to be privately burnt&#146;. His executors proved his will on 9 July 1705, and by the end of the month the manuscript promised to the Bodleian had arrived in Oxford. In October Thomas Hearne noted that a catalogue had revealed that Seller had owned &#145;a vast number&#146; of books and almost 200 coins  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.53&#150;4).<br>
