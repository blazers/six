<span class="headword">York,  Thomas  of</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1220, <em>d.</em> before 1269), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar and theologian</span>, of unknown parentage, had entered the Franciscan order in England by 1245, when Adam Marsh (<i>d</i>. 1259), a leading English Franciscan, requested the loan of a philosophy text in York's keeping. York was probably then resident at the London convent and studying arts, but must have been sent to Oxford before 1249. While studying theology at Oxford he joined for a time the household of Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln (<i>d</i>. 1253), probably through the good offices of Adam Marsh, who described York as &#145;active, discreet, full of goodwill and devoted to the cure of souls&#146;  (Brewer, 1.115). He was appointed lector at the Oxford Franciscan convent, but in 1253 a dispute arose at his presentation to incept as a doctor of theology, the opponents of the friars challenging his eligibility, as he had not been a master of arts. Through the firm and persuasive advocacy of Marsh he was eventually permitted to incept, but the case provoked the university to decree that in future no scholar who had not ruled in arts could proceed to a degree in theology: a statute that would engender recurrent disputes between the friars and the university. York's confr&egrave;re Roger Bacon (<i>d</i>. 1294) was probably referring to him when he wrote scornfully of a colleague who had presumed to teach philosophy without having read it; his critics ignored his fruitful study of arts, evident in his <span class="italic">Sapientiale</span>, at the London Franciscan convent. About 1256&#150;7 he was lector at the Cambridge convent. Bonaventure's reference in 1269 to his defence of the friars implies that York was dead by then.<br>
<br>York's defence of the mendicant friars' claims, <span class="italic">Manus quae contra omnipotentem</span>, was written <i>c</i>.1253&#150;6; and his sermon, &#145;Christ's passion&#146; (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS B.15.38), is probably contemporaneous with it. His major and unpublished work, the <span class="italic">Sapientiale</span> (Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, MS Conv. sopp. A.6.437), is a digest of the principal theological issues under debate in Oxford in the early 1250s, and was probably compiled from his university lectures and disputations. He proposed independent solutions to the current problems of generation and becoming, individuation, universals, the nature of the soul, and immaterial intelligences, which were influenced but not dominated by Grosseteste's ideas. In general he attempted a series of solutions to specific questions without displaying an overall metaphysical coherence, and the work's chief contribution was to bring into consideration the ideas of recently translated Arab and Jewish philosophers, especially Averroes and Moses Maimonides. It was soon overtaken by the profounder and better known works of Bonaventure, Albert the Great (Albertus Magnus), and Aquinas.<br>
