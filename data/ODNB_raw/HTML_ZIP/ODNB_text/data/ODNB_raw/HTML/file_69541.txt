<span class="headword">Hollis,  (James) Martin</span>  (1938&#150;1998), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born on 14 March 1938 in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London, the son of (Hugh) Marcus Noel [Mark] Hollis, an advertising agent and later a member of the Foreign Office, and his wife Ruth Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Colthurst. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31248/', "(Maurice) Christopher Hollis (1902&#150;1977)")</script>, author and politician, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31249/', "Sir Roger Henry Hollis (1905&#150;1973)")</script>, director-general of MI5, were his uncles. He won a scholarship to Winchester College, and did his national service in the Royal Artillery before going up to New College, Oxford, on a classics scholarship. At Oxford he read philosophy, politics, and economics, and was inspired by the teaching of A. J. Ayer, Wykeham professor of logic and a fellow of New College. He graduated with a second-class degree in 1961. After spending two years in the United States on a Harkness fellowship, studying sociology at Harvard University (where he first came across W. V. O. Quine and John Rawls, two philosophers who greatly influenced his work) and the University of California at Berkeley, he joined the Foreign Office, having come top in the entrance examination. Although still working at the Foreign Office until 1966, he found the life of a civil servant unstimulating, and was also a college lecturer in philosophy at New College from 1964 to 1965, and at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1965 to 1967. On 18 September 1965 he married Patricia Lesley (<i>b</i>. 1941), a historian and later a Labour politician, daughter of (Harry) Lesley George Wells, a civil servant. She was leader of Norwich city council from 1983 to 1988, and was created Baroness Hollis of Heigham in 1990. They had two sons, Simon (<i>b</i>. 1969) and Matthew (<i>b</i>. 1971).<br>
<br>In 1967 Martin and Patricia Hollis were both appointed to lectureships at the new University of East Anglia in Norwich, and he remained there for the rest of his career: he was promoted to senior lecturer in 1972, and in 1981 became professor of philosophy. He also served as dean of the school of economic and social studies from 1983 to 1986, and while pro-vice-chancellor (1992&#150;5) he had to administer the change from the traditional three-term academic year to a two-semester system on the American model. A brilliant lecturer, he held visiting lectureships and professorships in universities in North America and Germany, and taught at the philosophy summer school near Guangzhou, in China. He loved philosophical debate, and founded the East Anglia Philosophy Triangle, which held regular informal meetings in Norwich, Cambridge, and Colchester.<br>
<br>Hollis's main field of interest was the philosophy of social science, and central to his thought was a concern with the nature of rationality. He sought to broaden the notion of instrumental rationality, prevalent in economics, to include not just the means chosen but the ends sought. This enriched notion of &#145;expressive rationality&#146; embraced moral as well as intellectual virtues while remaining compatible with economics. He saw this approach as counter-acting the individualism of economic theory and as accommodating values of social co-operation and mutual trust. Also, by including goals and values within the framework of reason, he hoped that this notion of rationality would help to oppose any form of epistemological or cultural relativism. Much of his published work in philosophy consisted of explorations of the nature of rational choice in various academic disciplines, including anthropology, politics, economics, and history. <span class="italic">Rational Economic Man: a Philosophical Critique of Neo-Classical Economics</span> (1975, written with Edward J. Nell), was followed by <span class="italic">Models of Man: Philosophical Thoughts on Social Action</span> (1977), in which he dealt with the philosophy of sociology, and <span class="italic">The Cunning of Reason</span> (1988). With Steve Smith he examined the philosophy of international relations in <span class="italic">Explaining and Understanding International Relations</span> (1990). In his last book, <span class="italic">Trust within Reason</span>, published posthumously in 1998, he looked at moral and political philosophy. He also wrote two widely used textbooks, <span class="italic">An Invitation to Philosophy</span> (1985) and <span class="italic">The Philosophy of Social Science: an Introduction</span> (1994). He edited several collections of essays, including <span class="italic">Philosophy and Economic Theory</span> (1979) with Frank Hahn; <span class="italic">Rationality and Relativism</span> (1982) with Steven Lukes; and <span class="italic">Reason in Action: Essays in the Philosophy of Social Science</span> (1996); and wrote over ninety articles and reviews. A member of the editorial boards of <span class="italic">Cambridge Studies in Philosophy</span> from 1978 and the <span class="italic">Journal of Applied Philosophy</span> from 1984, he edited the Anglo-German philosophical journal <span class="italic">Ratio</span> from 1980 to 1987. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1990, and served on the council and as chairman of the philosophy section.<br>
<br>A JP in Norwich for ten years, Hollis also helped his wife in her political career on Norwich city council. He was a very strong chess player, often using chess to illustrate his philosophical points, and he also enjoyed playing bridge. For many years he set brain-teasers for the <span class="italic">New Scientist</span>, some of which were published as <span class="italic">Tantalisers</span> (1970). During the final months of his life, when he was suffering from a brain tumour and was confined to a wheelchair, he continued to take part in meetings and seminars. He died on 27 February 1998 at his home, 30 Park Lane, Norwich, and was survived by his wife and their two sons. The first of a series of Martin Hollis memorial lectures at the University of East Anglia was delivered on 5 May 1998.<br>
