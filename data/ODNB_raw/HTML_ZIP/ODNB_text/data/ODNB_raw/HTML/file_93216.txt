<span class="headword">Monck <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Middleton]</span>, Sir  Charles Miles Lambert</span>, sixth baronet  (1779&#150;1867), <span class="occ">architect, landscape designer, and politician</span>, was born in Golden Square, London, on 7 April 1779, the third but only surviving son of Sir William Middleton, fifth baronet (1738&#150;1795), army officer and politician, of Belsay, Northumberland, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1794), daughter of Lawrence Monck, landowner, of Caenby, Lincolnshire. He attended Rugby School from 1787 to 1794, after which he was taught at Caenby by a private tutor who encouraged his enthusiasm for Greek and Latin authors. He inherited the Belsay estate on his father's death in 1795. He never went to university. In 1798 he inherited Caenby from his maternal grandfather (who had in turn assembled the estate by inheritance through his wife, coheir of the Tournay family, and by purchase from his brother-in-law). His inheritance was disputed, and Middleton became a ward in chancery, but was confirmed as receiver of his own estates by the lord chancellor in 1798. He acceded to a request in Lawrence Monck's will by taking the surname of Monck by royal licence in 1799.<h2>
<a name="BelsayHallandgarden"></a>Belsay Hall and garden</h2>Despite the change of name, Sir Charles Monck found his Middleton inheritance in Northumberland more attractive than Caenby. An early indication of this was his appointment as sheriff of Northumberland for 1801&#150;2, and another his first marriage, on 11 September 1804 at Doncaster, to his first cousin Louisa Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1824), second daughter of Sir George Cooke, seventh baronet, and his wife, Frances Jory, daughter of Sir John Lambert Middleton, fourth baronet. The couple departed for a lengthy honeymoon in Greece, not returning for nearly two years: &#145;his honeymoon was &hellip; not only to be with his wife but with Greek architecture&#146;  (Watkin, 67). Monck was obsessed with the ancient world, reportedly never travelling anywhere without a copy of Horace, and his residence in Athens bore fruit not only in a son, Charles Atticus (1805&#150;1856), but also in friendships with the archaeologist William Gell and the architect William Wilkins, and first-hand experience of classical Greek architecture, which Monck resolved to manifest on his Northumberland estate. On his return to Belsay he began building a new house inspired by the Theseion, or temple of Theseus, in Athens. He was responsible for the design, though one architectural drawing for the hall of the new house was by Gell, very similar but not identical to that built. From about 1811 Monck was almost certainly assisted by John Dobson. The digging of the foundations began in August 1807, masonry began to be raised in 1809, and construction and decoration continued until 1830. Monck and his family did not move in until Christmas day 1817, when only the entrance hall and one bedroom above were completed. In order to extract sandstone to build the house, the village of Belsay was demolished, one house and a fragment of the seventeenth-century presbyterian chapel being allowed to survive as ruins, and the site turned into a quarry; a new village of Belsay was erected on the main Newcastle to Jedburgh turnpike road, which ran past the estate. The old castle of Belsay, a short distance from the new house, was abandoned, and the name of Belsay Castle transferred to the Grecian building, though it was also known as Belsay Hall.<br>
<br>Monck's &#145;new mansion&#146;  (Hussey, <span class="italic">English Country Houses</span>, 83) was perhaps the most consistent of those country houses of the period that derive their proportions from classical practice. The house was a complete square, with wholly plain fronts apart from the fluted columns at the entrance and the pilasters; the roof was low-pitched so as to be invisible from ground level. Monck's rationalism was expressed in his insistence that the proportional ratios of the design were calculated to three decimal places, forcing masons to abandon their conventional measurements in eighths of an inch. Monck devised a setting for the house that placed his temple as a focus of human order in a landscape that was less cultivated and more suggestive of chaos and decay the further it was from the house. While the immediate environs of the hall were landscaped by Monck in the tradition of Capability Brown and Humphry Repton, the rocky hillside opposite the hall to the south was forested with exotic conifers, Scots pine, and native hardwoods. The quarry excavated on the old site of Belsay village was turned into a canyon garden of the picturesque, inspired by the paintings of Salvator Rosa (1615&#150;1673) and Claude Lorrain (<i>c</i>.1600&#150;1682). Grottoes were divided by arches made to appear as if they had occurred naturally; planting was initially limited, to allow native ferns to establish themselves. The precedent of incorporating a quarry from which the stone for a house had been extracted into a picturesque garden would be followed by later country-house builders. Monck's plan to extend Belsay Lough was abandoned in the face of outrage from his neighbours&#151;an engineer had shown that a valve designed by Monck to regulate the amount of water in the lake could create a wave likely to damage property for several miles down the Blyth valley&#151;but a smaller lake than originally envisaged was placed to the south of the hall.<h2>
<a name="Independentwhig"></a>Independent whig</h2>The new house and landscape at Belsay expressed Monck's belief that a rationalist age would confirm the right of the independent country gentleman to rule. This was a doctrine he carried into politics. In 1805 he had been sounded out as a possible successor to Charles Grey as MP for Northumberland, should Grey inherit his father's peerage. Monck had agreed on the understanding that he would withdraw if there was a contest, as he could not afford the expense; and also that he would not regularly align himself with any party, but &#145;as the representative of a free body of people&#146;  (Monck to Grey, 26 April 1808, Fisher, &#145;Monck&#146;, 610) had to adopt whatever line seemed most correct to his judgement both in the abstract and in the interests of his constituents. Monck did not succeed Grey when he went to the House of Lords in 1807. He may at this point have been more interested in the House of Lords, as during 1809 he attempted unsuccessfully to prove the Middleton family tradition that, having been forfeited by Sir Gilbert Middleton in the fourteenth century, Belsay had returned to them by the marriage of Sir John Middleton to the daughter of John, Baron Stryvelyn; if true Monck could have claimed the Stryvelyn peerage as sole heir general, but later research has shown the connection to Stryvelyn to have been through a niece by marriage. He was elected to the Commons in April 1812 when Hugh, Earl Percy, heir to the duke of Northumberland, was called to the Lords. He retained the seat at the general elections of 1812 and 1818, without contests. In practice he normally voted with the opposition whigs throughout his period in the Commons, and was elected to Brooks's in June 1812. He voted with the government on occasion, for example against Henry Brougham's motion that Britain support the Spanish liberals; this was consistent with an outlook that, although in favour of the elimination of the parliamentary representation of decayed boroughs, was hostile to extension of the suffrage to those with little or no property. His favourite issues included the independence of the Ionian Islands, and he made motions relevant to that cause in 1816 and 1819. Thomas Creevey thought him a &#145;free spoken and honest politician&#146;  (Halcrow, &#145;Election campaigns&#146;, 107) but Monck's finances were stretched by the expenses of entertaining electors and supporting local events, and with the duke of Northumberland planning to introduce a candidate for the first time in eight years at the 1820 election, Monck chose not to fight that contest.<h2>
<a name="Countrygentleman"></a>Country gentleman</h2>While an MP Monck had maintained his other interests, designing Linden Hall, near Longhorsley, Northumberland, for his friend Charles William Bigge, in 1812&#150;13. He also experimented in horticulture: in 1817 he published <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Pruning of Fruit Trees</span>, and his method for transporting the buds of fruit trees, developed with Thomas Andrew Knight, was outlined in a paper by Knight in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Horticultural Society</span> in 1822. He was interested in agricultural improvement, but his wish that his tenants grow peas to avoid clover failure was strongly resisted by them. He also painted: a portrait of the queen of the Sandwich Islands and her attendant Boki, made in June 1824, survives.<br>
<br>Monck's wife died on 5 December 1824; as well as Charles Atticus, they had four daughters, only one of whom, Julia (1808&#150;1846), survived to adulthood, and a second son, William (1809&#150;1845). Monck made a visit to Italy in 1830&#150;31, where he probably saw the buildings that inspired his row of arcaded houses in Belsay village. On 26 July 1831 he married Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet (1783&#150;1864), daughter of Charles Bennet, fourth earl of Tankerville, at his new brother-in-law's house in Grosvenor Square, London; there were no children of the marriage. In 1832, having long campaigned for parliamentary reform, he declared that he would stand for election to the reformed Commons for the new southern division of Northumberland, but he withdrew when his criticism of the <span class="roman">Reform Act's</span> attack on nomination boroughs proved out of step with the expanded electorate.<br>
<br>In order to provide his second wife with an income Monck had had to mortgage part of his estate. Throughout his life Monck had been reliant on mortgages to raise money for his building projects, for the rounding out of his estates in Northumberland and Lincolnshire, and to maintain his income at a level appropriate for the independent country gentleman he wished to be. In 1819 Sydney Smith remarked that he had heard from Monck &#145;that rents begin to be paid again in Northumberland; I thought the practice had been lost altogether&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Memoir of the Reverend Sydney Smith</span>, 1855, 174). Other ways of raising income included a lease of his property at Allensford, Northumberland, for lead mining, from at least 1822. Monck was also an active breeder and racer of horses. He began investing in horses early in his career, but gained most success on the turf from the late 1830s onwards.<h2>
<a name="Laterlifeandreputation"></a>Later life and reputation</h2>Monck's politics in later life have been described as &#145;an idiosyncratic, independent Toryism&#146;  (Fisher, &#145;Monck&#146;, 612), and he maintained a long friendship with the Canningite tory politician Thomas Wallace; but in practice he always seems to have considered himself aligned with the whig party. His whiggishness remained of a classical sort, with an exalted place for the independent man of established property. In 1850 he gained national notoriety for successfully preventing a judge passing from one courtroom to another at Newcastle through a room used by the justices of the peace on the grounds that assize judges attended county courts as guests of the local magistracy, whose property Monck thought the courts were, and as such a meeting of &#145;the Queen's justices&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newcastle Daily Courant</span>) would have its independence violated by the room in which it met being treated as a passageway. At the 1852 election he wrote to his tenants in the North Lincolnshire constituency to emphasize that &#145;Nothing is more agreeable to the Constitution, and to all ancient usages of the Kingdom, or more advantageous to true liberty&#146;  (Olney, 35) than that he&#151;as a landlord and in a position analogous to the monarch&#151;should direct them to vote for his chosen candidate, the free-trade whig Sir Montague Cholmeley; even if they disagreed with him, he directed the tenants to vote as a bloc in order to protect the political unity of the estate. In 1858 he published <span class="italic">A Letter to the People on Reform of Parliament and the House of Lords</span>, a response to continued pressure for reform of the House of Commons and the attempt of Lord Palmerston to make Sir James Parke a life peer in 1856, and to the ascendance of a new school of constitutional historians who rejected Monck's old whig belief that the Commons and the Lords attained their ideal form soon after the Norman conquest. Monck argued that representation in both houses should be closely tied to property, envisaging a Lords where peerages were no longer limited to heirs male but to heirs general inheriting united estates sufficient to maintain their independence from the ministry. He saw the political realm as divided into five estates under the crown: the armed forces, from whom all future new peers should be drawn; the clergy; the lawyers; engineers, scientists, and inventors; and independent country gentlemen resident on their own estates.<br>
<br>By the 1850s Monck's political creed might have seemed remote from the mainstream, but he retained respect in the architectural field. The inaugural address of his former assistant John Dobson as president of the Northern Architectural Association in 1859 hailed his &#145;enterprise, and cultivated taste&#146;  (&#145;Northern Architectural Association&#146;, 404) in bringing the Grecian style of architecture to the north of England, setting a trend that provided work for a new generation of architects in the northern counties, and training masons at Belsay in techniques that established the reputation of Northumberland masons across England. Monck's racehorses also enjoyed a further period of good performances in the late 1850s, crowned with the victory of Gamester at the St Leger in 1859. He retired from horse breeding in 1860, selling his stock at York races for 3595 guineas.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>Monck's second wife died on 27 February 1864, and he died unexpectedly at Belsay Castle, Northumberland, in the early hours of 20 July 1867, after he &#145;rang his bell and called for his butler, stating that he was dying&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 July 1867). He had survived all his children, and was succeeded by his grandson, the eldest son of Charles Atticus Monck, Arthur Edward (1838&#150;1932). The seventh baronet sold Caenby and the other Lincolnshire properties in 1871, and changed his surname to Middleton in 1876. He introduced new plants into the garden at Belsay, following late nineteenth-century fashions, and built a new wing onto the old castle. The twentieth century saw the house attacked by dry rot, partly through the unforeseen effects of Monck's experimental central heating system, which was based on steam being fed into cavities in the walls; the Middletons moved out in 1962, and Belsay Hall (as Monck's house was by then known), the old castle, and the garden were placed in the guardianship of the Department of the Environment, responsibility passing in 1985 to English Heritage, which embarked on a programme of restoration and opened the site to the public.<br>
<br>Monck was a man of several convictions, but it was his faith in the marriage of Greek architectural principles and the picturesque as the best way of justifying the ascendancy of the gentry in English political life that proved the most enduring, though not as practical politics. Through Dobson, he influenced several decades of public and private architecture in Newcastle upon Tyne and north-east England. That his principal achievement, Belsay Hall and garden, is in the protection of a government agency established by a parliament elected by universal suffrage and containing life peers, regarded by Monck as twin evils that threatened the social and political order he sought to enhance, is an irony that might have perplexed him.<br>
