<span class="headword">Rodney,  Donald Gladstone</span>  (1961&#150;1998), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 18 May 1961 at Hallam Hospital, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, the youngest child of Harold George Rodney (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1995), labourer, and his wife, Iris Imogene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jackson. His parents were first-generation immigrants from Jamaica. Brought up in Smethwick, he completed a foundation course at Bournville School of Art, Birmingham, before studying for his degree in fine art at Trent Polytechnic, Nottingham (1981&#150;5). There he met Keith Piper, a black artist one year his senior, and through him Eddie Chambers, art critic and curator. Until that point he had specialized in wax-flower paintings, but under the influence of Piper and Chambers his subject matter changed to slavery, violence, and the black experience: &#145;I suddenly became aware of what I wanted to say and who I wanted to say it to. I no longer had to use the language given to me by western art traditions&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 11 March 1998). In 1982&#150;3 his collages and paintings were on display in &#145;The Pan-Afrikan Connection&#146; exhibition at Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham, the King Street Gallery in Bristol, and the Africa Centre in London. This was the BLK art group's first touring exhibition, curated by Chambers. He also exhibited in &#145;The BLK Art Group&#146; show in 1983&#150;4, which was the group's second touring exhibition held at the Herbert Art Gallery in Coventry, Battersea Arts Centre in London, and again at the Africa Centre.<br>
<br>When Rodney left Trent Polytechnic to study for his MA degree at the Slade School of Fine Art (1985&#150;7), he continued to create images that focused on black history. In 1986 he held a solo exhibition, &#145;The Atrocity Exhibition and Other Empire Stories&#146;, at the Black Art Gallery, London, and in the same year his work was also on display in the &#145;Young, Black and Here&#146; exhibition at the People's Gallery, London. Both these galleries were funded by the Greater London council when it was promoting black arts and anti-racism in London.<br>
<br>In the mid-1980s Rodney stopped making collages and paintings. His work went through several changes, and he experimented with different materials and new forms of presentation. In 1987 he collaborated with Isaac Julien in making the film <span class="italic">The Devil's Feast</span>. This was a homoerotic film that looked at black identity and food. In the same year Rodney participated in many exhibitions. He exhibited his work <span class="italic">E=mc<sup>2</sup></span> (a metaphor for the workings of twentieth-century capitalism) in &#145;Depicting History for Today&#146; at the Mappin Art Gallery in Sheffield. He was also in the group show with Keith Piper entitled &#145;Piper and Rodney: Adventures Close to Home&#146; at the Pentonville Gallery in London. In 1990 he made <span class="italic">Black Men Public Enemy</span> (Arts Council of England) from light boxes and duratran prints. The work was meant to contribute to debates about painting and multimedia in art history; its subject matter was the violence inflicted on black people.<br>
<br>From birth Rodney suffered from sickle-cell anaemia and in the mid-1980s spent long periods in hospital. He started to produce work about the illness that acted as a metaphor about the social order, economics, and other political concerns. In 1990 he was invited to participate in the &#145;TSWA Four Cities Project&#146;, a temporary public arts exhibition organized in Plymouth, Glasgow, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Berwick upon Tweed. He worked at The Battery in Mount Edgcumbe Country Park, Plymouth, and produced a work that pumped fake blood around the coat of arms belonging to Sir John Hawkins, the Elizabethan buccaneer and slave trader. In 1994 this work was shown in &#145;Truth Dare, Double Dare&#146; at the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, a collaborative exhibition with the artist Rose Finn-Kelcey. Rodney's last exhibition before his death was &#145;9 Night in Eldorado&#146; at the South London Gallery in October 1997. In this exhibition was a small piece of work made of skin taken from his body during one of his numerous operations. The work was a tiny house entitled <span class="italic">My Mother, my Father, my Sister and my Brother</span>, also known as <span class="italic">In the House of my Father</span> (Tate). Rodney himself was unable to attend the exhibition, and his place was taken by an &#145;autonomous&#146; wheelchair, modified by the school of computing at the University of Plymouth to perform a repeated sequence of circles, spirals, and figures of eight.<br>
<br>Rodney&#151;described by one obituarist as &#145;one of the most outstanding British artists of his generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 11 March 1998)&#151;died of sickle-cell anaemia and pulmonary emboli at King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London, on 4 March 1998; he was survived by his partner since the mid-1980s, Diane Symons. After his death she and a group of friends brought to completion his last project, <span class="italic">Autoicon</span>, an internet- and CD-ROM-based work designed to enable users to engage in simulated dialogue (derived from interviews with Rodney), and to affect an auto-generative montage-machine which creates images in the spirit of Rodney's own art.<br>
