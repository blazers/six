<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cardew,  Michael Ambrose</span>  (1901&#150;1983), <span class="occ">potter</span>, was born on 26 May 1901 at Wimbledon, Surrey, the third son and fourth child in the family of five sons and one daughter of Arthur Cardew, a civil servant, and his wife, Alexandra Rhoda, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34342/', "George William Kitchin")</script>, dean of Winchester and of Durham. He was educated at King's College School, Wimbledon, and in 1919 obtained a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford. He obtained a second class in classical honour moderations (1921) and a third class in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1923).<br>
<br>From childhood Cardew was surrounded by ceramics, which filled his parents' houses in Wimbledon and at Saunton, north Devon. It was the rural pottery made by Edwin Beer Fishley to which he was deeply attracted and he used to visit him at Fremington. When Fishley died in 1911, Cardew felt a sense of deprivation from which came the realization that if pots of the generous warm nature of Fishley's were to be obtained, he would have to make them himself. In the summer of 1921 he persuaded Fishley's grandson to give him lessons in throwing. Few though these were, they confirmed Cardew's love for the craft and precipitated a crisis in his academic work. He was faced with the ultimatum: either to give up potting or to surrender his scholarship. As he had long wanted to study philosophy, Cardew reluctantly agreed to put potting aside. The study of Plato and Aristotle, and the discipline of the school, left their mark. To his innate mental qualities&#151;an alertness and ability to master and express his thoughts in clear and vigorous language&#151;Cardew added a knowledge of method, and &#145;how to be capable of going on learning&#146;.<br>
<br>In January 1923 he went to St Ives to meet Bernard Leach and Shoji Hamada. Leach has described how &#145;he strode in, nose and brow straight, handsome as a young Greek god, eyes flashing blue, hair waving gold, and within an hour announced that this was where he wanted to work&#146;. In July he was back. Leach found that his first and best pupil &#145;possessed a sense of form, the potter's prime gift&#146;. Here he also met Katharine Pleydell-Bouverie, Norah Braden, Tsuranosuke Matsubayashi, and William Staite Murray.<br>
<br>In 1926 Cardew decided that he must be self-supporting and that he wanted to make slipware rather than the stoneware produced by Leach. Through S. Gordon Russell he found the disused pottery at Greet, near Winchcombe in Gloucestershire. Two years later he had confidence in his powers as a thrower, held his first exhibition in London, and was making a monthly average of 350 golden-brown pots. They were cheap and made to be used. The total value of what he made in 1928 was &pound;293 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. He was producing the most genuine lead-glazed slipware since the eighteenth century. In 1931 he was awarded the Kokuga prize at the National Artists' Society's annual exhibition in Japan. The section for craftsmen had been established in 1928. Cardew showed a large wide dish, a milk pan, with a combed pattern which demonstrated his fluency in slip trailing. It was filled with sushi after it won the main prize.<br>
<br>Cardew always lived simply, with few material comforts. He loved the music of Handel and Mozart, which he played on clarinet and recorder. In 1933 he married Mary-Ellen (Mariel), the daughter of Baron Russell, journalist and contributor to <span class="italic">Printer's Ink</span>. They had three sons: Seth, who followed his father as a potter; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67850/', "(Brian) Cornelius McDonough Cardew (1936&#150;1981)")</script>, composer; and Ennis, accountant. In 1939 they bought the inn at Wenford Bridge at St Breward in Cornwall, and converted it into a pottery. It remained their home despite long periods of absence and separation. In 1946 he sold the pottery at Winchcombe to Ray Finch, who continued to work there with Sidney Tustin as assistant.<br>
<br>Cardew was appointed pottery instructor at Achimota College in the Gold Coast in 1942 with responsibility for the tileworks at Alajo. Here he began to make stoneware. The years between 1942 and 1945 were not only demanding&#151;they were also unsuccessful to a degree which has subsequently been considered disastrous. Dicon Nance, who worked with him, has maintained that Cardew made endless technical mistakes and that he disregarded practical advice. On the closure of the factory, Cardew decided to move up the River Volta to open a pottery at V&uuml;me Dugam&eacute;. Here again he was less than successful because of poor raw materials, disasters in the kilns, and ill health. He still produced pots &#145;among the most beautiful to come from the hands of any modern potter&#146; aided by Clement Kofi Athey  (G. Wingfield-Digby, <span class="italic">The Work of the Modern Potter in England</span>, 1952).<br>
<br>Cardew returned to Wenford Bridge in 1948. Two years later he was appointed pottery officer for the Nigerian government. He travelled extensively and learned Hausa. From 1952 until 1965 at Abuja, as pottery officer for the department of commerce and industries, he at last achieved success, encouraging such potters as Ladi Kwali, and himself absorbing an understanding of the techniques and decoration of the indigenous culture. He used the incised native styles on stoneware bowls, casseroles, jars, jugs, stools, and teapots, because, as at Winchcombe, his pots were always intended for use.<br>
<br>Cardew retired to Wenford Bridge in 1965, the year in which he was appointed MBE (CBE followed in 1981). He also received an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Art in 1982. His hard apprenticeship in Ghana, together with his capacity for continuing to learn, bore fruit in his book <span class="italic">Pioneer Pottery</span> (1969). In addition to scientific analyses, this contains the essence of Cardew's experience and thought, showing him to have been a philosopher as well as a potter. This aspect of his thought was revealed in 1976 when he wrote:<blockquote>Ethics is about our duties to our neighbour but aesthetics is about our duty to all the things and creatures of the world we belong to. Our aesthetic conscience is therefore just as tender and just as imperious as the ethical conscience.</blockquote>Cardew's thoughts were invariably challenging and well expressed, not least in his autobiography <span class="italic">A Pioneer Potter</span> (1988), which he had wished to call &#145;A potter's progress&#146;. It encapsulates his career, his trenchant views, and his clarity in expressing them. That it leaves a number of questions unanswered, questions he might have answered but for his suffering a stroke, may be regretted but for those who wish to read between the lines, inferences can be drawn. Cardew had gifts as a teacher which found expression in the tours and demonstrations which he gave in the USA, Canada, and Australia. While he never taught in a formal sense, he taught many by example. Until his death, in Truro on 11 February 1983, he retained the energy and force of character which found expression in his pots.<br>
<br>A recent account of Cardew remarks that he was &#145;the exemplary maker of our time. His life as a potter made him alternately fiercely miserable and supremely happy. He asked himself hard questions and drove himself to the limits both physically and spiritually&#146;  (Harrod, 401). The film <span class="italic">Mud and Water Man</span> (1973) portrayed him &#145;as an essentially tragic figure, half angry, half humorous, caught between cultures, a man out of time and place&#146;  (ibid., 464), and yet at Wenford Bridge, at the end of his life, he was at home and showed himself to be a remarkable combination of his education and his skills, ever articulate, persuasive, one of the great potters of the twentieth century and one whose work has been reassessed and much appreciated since his death. In his autobiography, those who did not know him will meet the honest, invincible, unbroken Cardew. Examples of his pots can be seen in the collections of the University of Wales at Aberystwyth; the Surrey Institute of Art and Design, University College, Farnham; the City Museum and Art Gallery at Stoke-on-Trent; and the York City Art Gallery. He is also represented in the national collections, at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the university museums at Oxford and Cambridge.<br>
