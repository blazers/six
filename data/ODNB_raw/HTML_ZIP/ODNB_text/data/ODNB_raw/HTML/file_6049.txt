<span class="headword">Comyn,  Walter</span>, earl of Menteith  (<em>d.</em> 1258), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the second known son by his first marriage of William Comyn who, in right of his second wife, Marjory, became earl of Buchan <i>c</i>.1212 and who died in 1233. Walter had three brothers&#151;Richard, the eldest (<i>d</i>. 1244&times;9), David (married Isabel de Valognes, lady of East Kilbride), and William, a clerk&#151;and one sister, Jean (married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75448/', "William of Ross, second earl of Ross")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54308/', "Ross family (per. c.1215&#150;c.1415)")</script>]). By his father's second marriage, Walter had three half-brothers&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6042/', "Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1289)")</script>, who married Elizabeth de Quincy, William, and Fergus&#151;and three half-sisters&#151;Idonea (married Gilbert de la Hay), Agnes (married Philip Meldrum), and Elizabeth (married William, earl of Mar). Walter Comyn became earl of Menteith on his marriage to Isabella, daughter and heir of Maurice, earl of Menteith, between 30 June 1233 and 9 January 1234. The support of such a large family network was to be a key factor in Earl Walter's political influence between 1235 and 1258.<br>
<br>Walter Comyn's first appearance on record was as witness to two royal charters (between 1211 and 1214) of William the Lion (<i>r</i>. 1165&#150;1214) to Arbroath Abbey. It is a testimony to the political influence of his father, who was justiciar of Scotia <i>c</i>.1205&#150;<i>c</i>.1233 and sheriff of Forfar <i>c</i>.1195&#150;<i>c</i>.1212, that Walter Comyn appeared regularly at the royal court in the later years of William the Lion and throughout the reign of Alexander II (<i>r</i>. 1214&#150;49). By 1221 Comyn not only attended Alexander II on his marriage at York to Joan, sister of King Henry III, but was also one of twelve Scottish noblemen who swore on the Scottish king's behalf to observe the terms of the marriage settlement agreed with the king of England. From 1220 to 1229 Walter Comyn appeared with increasing regularity and prominence in the witness lists of Alexander II's charters. His elder brother Richard, who was still alive in 1244, had received the family estates in north and east Scotland, and devoted himself to these. But between 1229 and 1234 Walter came into possession of the lordship of Badenoch (the highland region based upon Strath Spey), given to him by Alexander II, perhaps as a reward for his father William Comyn's success in quelling the rebellion of Gillescop MacWilliam in Moray in 1229&#150;30. It is clear that Alexander saw the Comyns, in the persons of William and Walter, as playing a key role in reinforcing royal authority in the north, through their possession of Badenoch; the lordship included Lochaber, and occupied a strategic position dominating the principal passes from the north and west highlands into the Tay basin. Following the death of William Comyn in 1233, his son Walter assumed the leadership of the Badenoch (now the senior) branch of the family. His status received an additional boost by January 1234 when he became earl of Menteith on his marriage to Isabella of Menteith. In 1235 Earl Walter's trusted role as crown agent in the north was extended to the south-west, when he was given responsibility for bringing Galloway to order after Alexander II had defeated rebels there. Comyn's role as premier magnate in Scotland was shown at York in 1237 when he alone took a formal oath on the king of Scotland's soul to observe the treaty (the treaty of York) which Alexander II had entered into with Henry III.<br>
<br>Earl Walter was the dominant force in Scottish politics from 1237 to his death in 1258. In 1242 he and his family took action against members of the Bisset family, accused of murdering Patrick, earl of Atholl, an ally of the Comyns. His dominance was seen to be a threat by both Alexander II and Henry III in 1244, when Henry marched north with an army, forced a treaty of friendship from the Scottish king, and received a bond of good behaviour from Earl Walter as one of the leaders of two well-defined groups of Scottish magnates which had emerged by that time. Earl Walter and other Scottish nobles were accused of fortifying castles on the borders. Comyn himself strengthened the castle at Tarset in Northumberland, while Nicholas de Soulis and either Aymer or John Maxwell built castles at Hermitage (Liddesdale) and Caerlaverock (Nithsdale). Earl Walter was also suspected of harbouring the exiled Geoffrey de Marisco, whose son William had plotted to murder Henry III in 1238. Thus in 1244 Earl Walter and his following (forty-one names in all) had to swear that they were neither linked with attacks on the English king's lands in Ireland, nor had given shelter to the English king's enemies. The promotion of Alan Durward (<i>d</i>. 1275) as justiciar of Scotia in 1244, and therefore as head of government, was aimed at curtailing Earl Walter's political power. The nature of the earl's following, however&#151;a tightly knit family group, strong in numbers and influence, based on the three main branches of the Comyn family (the Badenoch, Buchan, and Kilbride lines) and their connections&#151;ensured that Earl Walter was not eclipsed after 1244.<br>
<br>This became apparent in the minority crisis following Alexander II's death in 1249. Earl Walter successfully thwarted Alan Durward's attempt to formalize his position as head of government during the minority. He emerged once again as the dominant Scottish magnate and it was through a joint Comyn and clergy invitation that Henry III intervened in Scottish political affairs in 1251&#151;an intervention sealed by the marriage of Henry III's daughter, Margaret, to the young Alexander III (<i>r</i>. 1249&#150;86) at York&#151;replacing the Durward-led government by a Comyn-dominated one. Earl Walter, perhaps surprisingly, did not become the justiciar of Scotia, the most important government office, but he ensured that his leading supporters were in all the key positions; Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan, became the justiciar. The years 1251 to 1255 saw Walter Comyn's government successfully deny Henry III's attempts to influence affairs in Scotland through his two appointed guardians to the young Scottish king and queen, Robert de Ros (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1270) and John de Balliol. Henry III intervened again in 1255, supporting Alan Durward's counter-coup, and replacing Comyn leadership with a council of fifteen which would serve for seven years. Alan Durward, who became justiciar of Scotia, was prominent in the new government. His fear of Earl Walter's continuing power in 1255 was obvious in his attempts to discredit the Comyns and reduce their influence by renewing his claim to the earldom of Mar. Comyn and his party refused to put their names to the document setting up the 1255 council, and having failed to convince Henry III that he should intervene once more on their behalf, they kidnapped the young king at Kinross in 1257 and thus regained control of government. For once lacking general support within Scotland, Earl Walter tried to bolster his position by allying his supporters, largely restricted to the Comyn family itself, with Llywelyn of Wales and his supporters in 1258. The cautious terms of the treaty indicated Earl Walter's reluctance to act unconstitutionally and against the wishes of the Scottish king. But it was also significant that Henry III was no longer in a position to intervene, as he was beset at home by opposition from the baronial reform movement, and in fact ceased to control the English government after 12 June. Indeed, without external interference compromise was soon reached, when in September 1258 a new council of ten was agreed upon in Scotland. This included four Comyn supporters headed by Walter Comyn, and four Durward supporters.<br>
<br>Walter Comyn was still the leading political figure in Scotland when he died in late October or early November 1258, apparently as a result of a fall from his horse. Messengers came to Henry III at St Albans on 22 November specially to report his death. Matthew Paris described him as &#145;the most powerful earl in Scotland&#146;  (Paris, <span class="italic">Chron</span>., 5.724). In Scotland, even the largely anti-Comyn chronicler, John Fordun, described him as a &#145;man of foresight and shrewdness in council&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronica gentis Scottorum</span>, 2.289). To the Comyn party, fear of loss of power was reflected in Walter Comyn's nephew and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6044/', "John Comyn")</script>, seizing (but holding for a short time only) the earldom of Menteith from Walter's widow and her new husband, Sir John Russell, an English knight, amid accusations that Walter Comyn had been poisoned. A visible witness to Earl Walter's importance was his foundation <i>c</i>.1238 of the Augustinian priory of Inchmahome, set on the largest of three islands in the Lake of Menteith, close to a probable chief residence on the adjacent island of Inchtalla. Patronage was also given to Scone and Arbroath abbeys.<br>
<br>Earl Walter's significance in a critical period of Scottish history prompted a number of extreme views about his role. To the influential but monarchocentric fourteenth- and fifteenth-century chroniclers John Fordun and Walter Bower, Walter Comyn was the unprincipled leader of an over-mighty faction, threatening the monarchy itself. Yet Comyn had been a key royal agent in the north (1229 onwards) and in the south west (1235). His leadership of the Scottish political community was, except in 1257&#150;8, largely with the support of the Scottish nobility and church. Alternatively Walter Comyn has been portrayed as the leader of a &#145;native&#146; party. Yet, though he restricted the influence of the guardians appointed by Henry III between 1251 and 1255, he did not pursue nationalistic policies. He recognized, like his opponents in Scotland, the political necessity of Henry III's support during the minority crisis of Alexander III.<br>
