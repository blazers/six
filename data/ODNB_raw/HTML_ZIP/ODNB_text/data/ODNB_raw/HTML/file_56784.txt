<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lascelles,  Frank William Thomas Charles Christian Culpeper</span>  (1875&#150;1934), <span class="occ">pageant master</span>, was born in Sibford Gower, Oxfordshire, on 30 July 1875, the youngest of the three children of Edward Thomas Stevens (1832&#150;1898), vicar of Holy Trinity, Sibford Gower, from 1874 until his death, and his wife, Isabella Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper (1833/4&#150;1907). His name at birth was Frank William Thomas Charles Stevens. The home atmosphere was cultivated and literary: his father, who had run a school in Islington, London, and written school textbooks before studying at Oxford in his late thirties in preparation for the church, was an admirer of Ruskin and Emerson; his mother, a &#145;Botticelli-like&#146; beauty  (Darnley, 239), had taught at the Islington school. The sculptor Alfred Stevens was a relative. Frank was brought up with stories of medieval artists and saints, with recitations, drawing, and &#145;dressing-up&#146;. His early enthusiasms were for Burne-Jones, Morris, Rossetti, Shelley, and Swinburne.<br>
<br>Stevens was educated at the village school in Sibford Gower and then privately. Admitted to Keble College, Oxford, in 1895 to study English literature, and tutored by Ernest de Selincourt, he left without a degree. A heart affliction and a serious eye complaint interrupted his studies; when he took his finals in 1899, he &#145;knew enough for a third class but broke down during the examinations&#146;  (Keble College archives). Meanwhile the undergraduate journalists of <span class="italic">Isis</span> (19 Feb 1898) declared him an &#145;Idol&#146; as a leading light of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, who took a prominent role in his first term, and proceeded to a &#145;tremendous success&#146; as Romeo.<br>
<br>Stevens moved to London where he became an actor. During the years 1904 to 1906 he performed in the famous company of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, playing Laertes, Nero, and Octavius Caesar, although he was said to have been unhappy on stage. At about this time he took the surname Lascelles, and subsequently assumed additional forenames, though no deed poll has been located for the changes.<br>
<br>Tree introduced into his Shakespearean productions pageant-like scenes of historical events and staged imperial celebrations. Lascelles was soon to become famous for his work as a specialist producer, a &#145;pageant master&#146;; between 1907 and 1932 he produced twenty-two pageants. With the Oxford historian Charles Oman, Lascelles had attended the ambitious pageant at Warwick of 1906 staged by Louis Napoleon Parker. The new vogue for pageants was claimed as a revival of a didactic pictorial and theatrical art as old in England as the book; historical events were now impressed on the mind by drama and spectacle, and used to foster a civic and national sense. Directed by Lascelles, who became known as &#145;the man who staged the Empire&#146;, they were also to become compelling imperial celebrations and propaganda.<br>
<br>The Oxford Historical Pageant of summer 1907, Lascelles's first project, engaged his romantic, picturesque idealism, his &#145;magnetic persuasiveness&#146;  (Darnley, 5), and his celebrated patience and tact. The story of the city and university, from the coming of St Frideswide, was presented in three-hour performances of fifteen scenes (with a &#145;masque of mediaeval learning&#146; as interlude) and was performed on Christ Church Meadow. Lascelles was told that university people would not dress up in costume and that the town and gown would not work together, but with the support of Oman and Francis Madan an impressive number of academics joined the committee, and it was a great success. Among the &#145;dramatic authors&#146; were Oman himself, Robert Bridges, Laurence Housman, Laurence Binyon, Stanley Weyman, and Professor Walter Raleigh. Charles Ricketts was a designer, and Hubert Parry and Beerbohm Tree advised on the music and spectacle. Several hundred horses took part, in addition to the 3000 performers, and there was a colourful antiquarian flourish of armour, heraldry, ecclesiastical vestments, and academic robes.<br>
<br>In Canada the following year Lascelles excited patriotism and imperial loyalty with the Quebec Tercentenary Pageant of July 1908, held on the Plains of Abraham, attended by the prince of Wales. The celebrations had been planned by Lord Grey, governor-general of Canada, as an occasion to reinforce Anglo-French amity, and Lascelles staged a pageant which brought together British and French Canadians. The historical scenes, planned by the dominion archivist, Arthur Doughty, carefully balanced the different periods of French and British rule, and military victories and defeats. They were directed by Lascelles, who organized some 4000 performers, and secured the co-operation of French-speaking Catholics of Quebec. He also recruited Iroquois, and they afterwards made him a chieftain with the title Tehonikonraka (&#145;man of infinite resources&#146;). In July 1909 he returned to English themes, when he was master of the Bath Historical Pageant.<br>
<br>Lascelles's success in orchestrating the Quebec pageant led to his appointment by the Cape Town city council as master of the historical pageant planned as part of the celebrations to mark the opening of the first parliament of the newly created Union of South Africa in 1910. The pageant, which depicted scenes from South African history, took place over several days in late October and early November 1910, and was attended by the duke of Connaught as representative of the British crown. As in Quebec, two settler traditions, British and Afrikaner, had to be reconciled. Nearly 5000 performers were drawn from Cape Town's residents. Other groups participating included bushmen, Hottentots, and Portuguese grandees; the Basuto made Lascelles a chieftain, with the name Rakalelo (&#145;the father of wonderful thoughts&#146;). At the conclusion, civic tributes were paid to Lascelles's work.<br>
<br>Since late 1907 Lascelles had been planning a pageant of London, though it was repeatedly postponed (in 1910 on account of the death of Edward VII). Instead it formed part of the Festival of Empire, Imperial Exhibition, and Pageant of London, held at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, in 1911 as part of the ceremonies accompanying the coronation of George V. The events were organized by a council chaired by Lord Plymouth, with Lascelles being appointed master of the Festival of Empire and of the Pageant of London. The festival opened on 12 May, and the first performance of the pageant was on 8 June 1911. The latter, which was in four parts, performed on separate days, celebrated the &#145;magnificence, glory and honour of the Empire and the Mother Country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Festival of Empire: Imperial Exhibition and Pageant of London</span>, 1911), and was said to be Lascelles's own &#145;crowning triumph&#146;. He persuaded over thirty London boroughs as well as corporate bodies to become involved and to sponsor individual scenes, whose performers were drawn from those boroughs. They rehearsed twice a week for six months beforehand. Forty &#145;striking scenes of the Empire City&#146; were performed in the English Landscape Garden of the Crystal Palace, by 15,000 costumed volunteers, including titled folk and &#145;artisans&#146;; Penge supplied &#145;hundreds of picturesquely-clad early Britons&#146; to present Roman London, with the Emperor Carausius in a chariot  (<span class="italic">Pageant of London Programme</span>, 2), while Wimbledon and Merton supplied uniformed warriors for the scene depicting the battle of Bosworth Field. The speeches were hardly audible during the performances, but Lascelles, praised by his friend Frank Brangwyn for his sense of colour, was admired for his painterly &#145;colour massing&#146; and &#145;fluid and evanescent&#146; movements  (Darnley, 83). Fifteen state coaches were used. In a climactic &#145;Masque of Empire&#146; Britannia proved her right to her vast empire, whose representatives appeared &#145;in vast procession to lay their riches at her feet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pageant of London Programme</span>, 2). Performances of a selection of the scenes continued until the end of August 1911.<br>
<br>Immediately afterwards Lascelles accepted an invitation to stage a pageant in Calcutta to mark the royal visit to India, and sailed for India in September 1911. Famous for its colossal scale and colourful spectacle, the pageant was held on the Maidan, Calcutta, on 5 January 1912. Originally planned as a succession of scenes from Indian history, the pageant instead took the form of two traditional processions, Muslim and Hindu, and was organized by Lascelles and the orientalist Denison Ross. It involved a cast of 300,000, with massed troops, horsemen in chain armour, a war dance, elephant processions, caparisoned horses, oxen-drawn carts, and palanquins.<br>
<br>Lascelles's successes as a pageant master enabled him to establish himself at Sibford Gower, where he declared himself lord of the manor. He designed a second new &#145;manor house&#146; in the village in 1915, adding a tower, a great hall, thatched roofs, and gardens to an existing barn and cottages. Here he entertained his many celebrated and interesting friends at house parties and directed alfresco Shakespeare productions with the local community; Ivor Novello reputedly composed &#145;Keep the Home Fires Burning&#146; while on a visit. He did much to beautify the village, paying for a hall and embellishing Holy Trinity with First World War memorial doors, a memorial with a marble bust of his mother, and a bronze angel on the family tomb. His activities during the war years are unclear, though he visited Toronto in 1916 to stage for the Empire Club an abbreviated production of Hardy's <span class="italic">The Dynasts</span>.<br>
<br>Lascelles returned to pageant direction in 1923, when he was responsible for the Harrow historical pageant. He was master of the Bristol Pageant, entitled &#145;The Cradle of the Empire&#146;, which opened in May 1924. In that month he was called in at short notice by William Lunn, a junior minister in Ramsay MacDonald's Labour administration, as pageant master-in-chief to replace ineffectual producers at the government-sponsored British Empire Exhibition. Within weeks he had enrolled 15,000 performers for the opening in Wembley stadium on 25 July 1924. Although less ambitious than at Sydenham, the empire pageant at Wembley colourfully presented the &#145;noble episodes&#146; of the history of the empire and the dominions, to &#145;light the torches of the future at the glowing heart of the past&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Pageant of Empire, Souvenir Volume</span>, 1924). There were historical texts by Charles Oman, an Indian episode designed by Denison Ross, scenery and decorative souvenir programmes by Brangwyn, lyrics written by Alfred Noyes, and music composed by Edward Elgar. Elizabethans were said to &#145;scamper in a dazzle of blue and yellow and red&#146;, and &#145;turbaned orientals stippled the dusk with countless specks of white&#146;  (ibid.). When the pageant concluded its season in August 1924, Lascelles was carried shoulder-high by Maori warriors and acclaimed with laurel wreaths.<br>
<br>Lascelles next mastered a series of provincial historical pageants, among them Carlisle (1928); Stoke-on-Trent (1930) for the Wedgwood bicentenary celebrations; Rochester (1931), with Canterbury pilgrims, Charles Dickens, and an assault on the castle; Bradford (1931); the charter celebrations of Barking (1931); and the counties of Leicester (1932), Essex (1932), and Kent (1932).<br>
<br>Lascelles was also a sculptor, whose portrait busts included Edward, prince of Wales, the duke of Connaught, Earl Grey, and the Aga Khan III.<br>
<br>An effusive commemorative volume of 1932, edited by the eighth earl of Darnley, praised Lascelles's contribution to &#145;the civic, patriotic, and imperial sense of the many peoples who have been inspired by his art and personality&#146;, saying that to hundreds of thousands throughout the British empire he brought joy, uplifting the race &#145;artistically, mentally, and spiritually&#146;  (Darnley, ix). It contained a collection of tributes from British and colonial politicians, civic dignitaries in places where he had organized pageants, collaborators, friends, and, lastly, his manservant, Ewart Bodfish.<br>
<br>Lascelles was unmarried. His end was pitiful, dying on 23 May 1934 at 10 Clifton Place, Brighton, in poverty and sickness, after ten weeks at the boarding-house. His family told the press that his ill health had involved him in considerable losses, in spite of the properties he owned in Sibford Gower; he had been unable to attend to his financial affairs, and had given away more than he could afford. He had asked Frank Brangwyn to administer his estate to fund a &#145;school of nations&#146; for children from all over the world to promote world peace and understanding, but his net estate proved small, and his intended benefaction was not feasible.<br>
