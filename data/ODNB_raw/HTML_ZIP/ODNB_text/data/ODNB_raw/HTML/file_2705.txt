<span class="headword">Blower,  Samuel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Loughborough, Leicestershire. Little is known of his background and family, but Blower later in life used to boast that he and his fellow nonconformist minister John Howe were both born in the same town and had attended the same school, by which he probably meant Winwick grammar school in Lancashire. He matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 20 February 1649, graduating BA in 1652 and MA in 1654, and being incorporated at Cambridge in 1656. He was a fellow of Magdalen from 1652 to 1660 and its senior dean of arts in 1658&#150;9. On 8 April 1657 he was admitted by the committee for plundered ministers lecturer at Woodstock, Oxfordshire, and later that year, on 29 September, was appointed an assistant to the Oxfordshire triers.<br>
<br>In 1660 Blower was ejected both from his fellowship at Magdalen, on the grounds of slight nonconformity, and his lectureship at Woodstock. He found a place as chaplain to Samuel Dunch of North Baddesley, Hampshire, who in 1667 left him &pound;20 per annum for life, for his &#145;great paines for the spirituall good of both me and my Family&#146;  (Cliffe, 48). In 1672 Blower was licensed as a congregationalist preacher at Sudbury in Suffolk, where he seems to have had family connections, but finally settled at Northampton in 1674 or early 1675 after an invitation to serve as pastor to the presbyterian Castle Hill congregation. In 1692 he was one of those ministers who condemned the evangelizing activities of the Northamptonshire Independent pastor Richard Davis with its echoes of an earlier, more radical phase of dissent. In 1689 Blower is also found serving a congregation at Coventry. In 1694 he retired from his ministry at Northampton and moved to Abingdon.<br>
<br>Blower's will, made at Abingdon on 16 June 1699, reveals the existence of a wife, Elizabeth, but does not mention any children. He held property at Eynsham, some of which had been conveyed to him through their marriage settlement, and elsewhere in Oxfordshire. A cousin was to preserve his books, writings, and papers &#145;except some English authors which his wife desires to have for her own use&#146;  (Gasquoin and others, 90). Blower died in 1701 and was buried on 13 October at St Helen's Church, Abingdon. Edmund Calamy had a good opinion of him, describing him as &#145;of a meek temper, peaceable principles, and a godly life&#146;, one who was &#145;very desirable as a friend; for he was free and communicative, candid in the last degree, of a very sympathising spirit&#146;. Calamy recorded that &#145;scripture revelation in scripture language&#146; was a favourite subject for his discourses and that &#145;he affected not a pompous way of preaching&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 2.717). Blower's only published work was a funeral sermon for Mrs Elizabeth Tub on <span class="roman">Psalm 18:</span> 46 (1697).<br>
