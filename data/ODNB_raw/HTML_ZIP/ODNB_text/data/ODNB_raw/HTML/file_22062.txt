<span class="headword">Pettie,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1893), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 17 March 1839, the eldest of the three sons and two daughters of Alexander Pettie, a prosperous shopkeeper, and his wife, Alison Frier. At the age of thirteen he moved with his family to East Linton, East Lothian, and it was here that he began to show artistic promise by making copies of reproductions of paintings with household paints from his father's shop. On 16 October 1855 he enrolled at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh, where he studied for five years under Robert Scott Lauder. Among his contemporaries were William Quiller Orchardson, William MacTaggart, and George Paul Chalmers, all of whom later became distinguished painters.<br>
<br>An ambitious and conscientious student, Pettie began exhibiting at the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh, in 1858, and two years later had his first picture accepted by the Royal Academy in London. Among his early successes were numerous interpretations of incidents from the novels of Sir Walter Scott, including <span class="italic">Scene from &#145;The Monastery&#146;</span> (1859), as well as historical subjects, such as <span class="italic">The Prison Pet</span> (1859; priv. coll.). His gift for visual narrative was recognized by the publishers Blackie &amp; Son, who commissioned him to produce illustrations for their devotional part-work <span class="italic">Family Worship</span> (1862&#150;3). Commercial assignments of this kind were to provide a lucrative source of income in the early stage of Pettie's career, and throughout the 1860s he regularly contributed illustrations to several other popular periodicals, among them <span class="italic">Good Words</span> and the <span class="italic">Sunday Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>The financial security provided by his work as an illustrator enabled Pettie to move to London in 1862. Here he shared lodgings at 62 Stanley Street, Pimlico, with his former student colleague Orchardson, with whom he moved in 1863 to 37 Fitzroy Square (a house later occupied by Ford Madox Brown). On 24 August 1865 he married Elizabeth Ann Bossom, the sister-in-law of the Scottish painter C. E. Johnson, and lived with her in Regent's Park before moving to St John's Wood Road in 1869. They had three sons, Graham, Ralph, and Norman, and a daughter, Alison, who later married the Scottish composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34695/', "Hamish MacCunn")</script>. In 1882 the family finally settled in The Lothians, a house in Fitzjohn's Avenue designed for Pettie by his friend the architect William Wallace.<br>
<br>On his arrival in London, Pettie quickly established himself as the leader of a group of expatriate Scottish painters, whose work was distinguished by the vividness of its narrative content and the brilliance of its visual style. Pettie himself was strongly influenced by the earlier work of Sir David Wilkie, from whom he developed an interest in physical gesture and facial expression. Much of his subject matter was historical, with the turbulent events of the English civil war and the Jacobite rising providing his principal source material. His approach to the representation of history was not, however, a rigorously academic one, and in most cases the scenes he depicted were intended merely to embody the &#145;spirit and romance of history&#146;  (Hardie, 1908, 76) rather than illustrate documented historical occurrences. Typical examples of such historical fictions are <span class="italic">The Drumhead Court-Martial</span> (1862; Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust), <span class="italic">Treason</span> (1867; Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust), and <span class="italic">The Vigil</span> (1884; Tate collection). In many cases the narrative is focused on a single dramatic moment, as in <span class="italic">The Disgrace of Cardinal Wolsey</span> (1869; Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust), a psychologically charged study of political humiliation, or <span class="italic">The Sally</span> (1870; Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust), in which suspense is created by the skilful massing of a group of soldiers huddled behind a castle door. Apart from the clarity and force of his narrative technique, Pettie's great strength as a painter lay in his ability to evoke the atmosphere of a historical period through the effective use of costume and background accessories. He was also a fine colourist, and in many of his mature paintings the composition is organized around a dominant figure, or group of figures, dressed in brilliantly coloured costumes. Examples of this tendency are <span class="italic">Ho! Ho! Old Noll</span> (1874; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum) and <span class="italic">The Chieftain's Candlesticks</span> (1886; Forbes Magazine Collection, New York).<br>
<br>Towards the end of his career Pettie began to concentrate on studies of social manners, with works such as <span class="italic">Two Strings to her Bow</span> (1887; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum) and <span class="italic">The World Went Very Well Then</span> (1890; Dundee City Art Gallery) typifying his fondness for idealizing the day-to-day life of rural communities. It is significant, however, that these are almost invariably set in the Regency period, rather than Pettie's own day, despite his frequent use of friends and relatives as models. His reluctance to engage with contemporary history extended to his portraits, many of which present the sitter in period costume or in the manner of earlier artists such as Rembrandt. In his portrait of the novelist William Black, for example, the subject is depicted as <span class="italic">A Knight of the Seventeenth Century</span> (1877; Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum).<br>
<br>One of the most critically and commercially successful artists of his day, Pettie became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1866 and a Royal Academician eight years later. He himself attributed his success to an almost superhuman capacity for hard work, and there is little doubt that his lifelong dedication to painting left little time for other pursuits. As a student his principal leisure activity was participating in the meetings of an informal sketching club, a practice which he continued after his arrival in London. Similarly, his involvement with the National Volunteer Association in Edinburgh in 1859, and his consequent role in the establishment of the Artists' company of the City artillery volunteers, may be seen as an extension of the passion for military matters which inspired much of his creative output. Towards the end of 1892 he began to suffer from an abscess of the ear, and on 10 January 1893 he was found unconscious on his studio floor. The abscess was later removed, but he failed to recover and died at 47 Eversfield Place, Hastings, on 21 February. He was buried in Paddington cemetery six days later.<br>
