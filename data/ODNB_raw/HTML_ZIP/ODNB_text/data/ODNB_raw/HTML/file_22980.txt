<span class="headword">Radcliffe, Sir  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1593, <em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized in Thornhill on 21 April 1593, the son of Nicholas Radcliffe (<i>d</i>. 1599) of Overthorpe in the parish of Thornhill, Yorkshire, and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1628), eldest daughter and coheir of Robert Marsh of Darton, Yorkshire, and widow of John Baylie of Honley in the same county. In 1607 he attended Mr Hunt's school at Oldham, where he proved himself a good scholar; in November 1609 he matriculated at University College, Oxford, and graduated BA on 24 May 1612. Earlier in the year, on 5 February, he entered Gray's Inn, where he was called to the bar in 1618. About this time he contracted what proved a brief first marriage to a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9438/', "John Finch, later Baron Finch")</script>.<h2>
<a name="EarlyassociationwithWentworth16181633"></a>Early association with Wentworth, 1618&#150;1633</h2>Radcliffe's early career appears to have been successful, but his prospects were improved by his association with Sir Thomas Wentworth, later earl of Strafford. He was introduced to Wentworth at Christmas 1618 by his former tutor, Charles Greenwood, who had accompanied Wentworth on his tour of France. During the next few years Radcliffe acted as counsel for Wentworth and his sister on a number of matters, and by 1629 he was also handling work for Wentworth's father-in-law, John Holles, earl of Clare. Together with Greenwood (later replaced by Christopher Wandesford), Richard Marris, Wentworth's steward, and Peter Man, his solicitor, Radcliffe oversaw the management of Wentworth's estate from the early 1620s onwards. His second wife, Anne (1600/01&#150;1659), eldest daughter of Sir Francis Trappes of Harrogate and of Nidd, both in Yorkshire, whom he married on 21 February 1622, was Wentworth's first cousin.<br>
<br>By the mid-1620s Radcliffe's practice kept him in London for at least the law terms, and he was in the capital in 1627 during the early period of the forced loan. By April he had decided to refuse, and he was imprisoned in the Marshalsea on the orders of the privy council on 24 April. He answered his wife's concerns with assurances of &#145;exceeding good company, pleasant and sweet walkes, and every kind usage, beyond expectation in a prison&#146;, and explained his resolve not to follow the example of two fellow prisoners who had attracted derision by subsequently conforming  (Whitaker, 107, 148). In June he was joined by Wentworth, and together they were moved to Dartford, Kent, in late July. Radcliffe spent the next few months in confinement, apart from a brief trip to London on the dowager countess of Leicester's business. He appears to have announced his freedom a little prematurely, which prompted Wandesford to warn Wentworth not to do likewise. Radcliffe's correspondence with his wife shows him to have sat in the 1628 parliament, but his name is not listed in the register.<br>
<br>Wentworth's promotion to the offices of president of the council of the north and later lord deputy of Ireland brought benefits for Radcliffe. In December 1628 he informed his wife that Wentworth aimed to secure him the office of king's attorney at York, and he was certainly in office by the summer of 1629. He was not immediately added to the commission of the peace, nor was he placed on the northern commission for compounding with recusants, despite the close connection between that commission and the council of the north. In November 1632, however, he was preferred to the office of one of the king's council learned in the law; that year he also became a bencher of his inn.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinIreland16331640"></a>Service in Ireland, 1633&#150;1640</h2>In January 1633 Radcliffe preceded Wentworth to Ireland on &#145;special service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Ire.</span>, <i>1625&#150;32</i>, 675), armed with the king's directions that the lords justices Richard Boyle, earl of Cork, and Adam, Viscount Loftus, support him in his work. Wentworth's first dispatch to Secretary Sir John Coke of 3 August 1633 reported on Radcliffe's work in the case against the bishop of Kilfenora, and ended with the request that Radcliffe be sworn of the council, &#145;ther being many of them allready at this Bord allmost beneath him as farr in estate as they are in Partes and understanding&#146;  (Strafford papers, 5/10). The king granted the request immediately and Radcliffe was knighted by the lord deputy on 1 November of that year. In October 1632, in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Wentworth, Cork had suggested Radcliffe for the mastership of the rolls, an office that was filled instead by Christopher Wandesford. Unlike Wandesford, Radcliffe was not given a key office in Ireland, although suitable posts did become vacant: in 1636 the post of attorney-general went to another member of Wentworth's team of Yorkshiremen, Richard Osbaldeston, also a bencher of Gray's Inn. Wentworth seems to have preferred to employ Radcliffe in a more flexible manner, ensuring that he was well rewarded for his efforts by his membership of the Irish customs farm from 1632. In 1636&#150;7, following Wentworth's reorganization of the farm, Radcliffe's eighth part of the profits earned him &pound;2800. The king had also granted him &pound;500 per annum in compensation for the loss of his legal practice. His income enabled him to invest in land in the Connaught plantation, and he also acquired property in co. Wicklow.<br>
<br>It has been noted that &#145;None of his servants in Ireland was more important to Wentworth, or more trusted, than Sir George Radcliffe, his legal expert, whose ingenious legal trickery was vital in enabling the crown to regain the political initiative in Ireland&#146;  (Merritt, 140). He worked on a very broad range of business, including legal work, the customs farm&#151;of which he controlled the accounts&#151;and church affairs, on which he advised Archbishop William Laud and Bishop John Bramhall. In addition he handled the private landed and commercial interests of Wentworth's friends and political allies. Radcliffe made several visits to England to further and protect the lord deputy's concerns, and he accompanied Wentworth in the summer of 1636 when he was added to the commissions of the peace for all three ridings of Yorkshire. In the parliament of 1634 he sat for the city of Armagh, following Cork's refusal to place him in a seat under his control, and he was an active government member. It was Radcliffe who informed the council of Sir Piers Crosby's opposition to a government bill, prompting his removal from the board. In 1639 Radcliffe and Wandesford both contributed &pound;500 towards the king's war effort against the Scots. In the Irish parliament of 1640 he was knight of the shire for Sligo, his son Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1623?) sitting for the borough, but he travelled to England in June to attend his patron, now earl of Strafford, who was seriously ill. Staying until August, he stood surety with Francis Cottington, Lord Cottington, chancellor of the exchequer, and another individual, possibly Wentworth, for the cost of the pepper cargo. His service earned him the lord deputy's praise, but it also ensured that he would be implicated in the charge of high treason brought against Strafford.<h2>
<a name="Imprisonmentandexile"></a>Imprisonment and exile</h2>On 13 November the English House of Commons resolved that Radcliffe's membership of the Irish parliament did not protect him against a possible charge of high treason, and he was ordered to appear before the house. On 9 December 1640 he was committed to the gatehouse and articles of impeachment against him were read in the Commons and presented to the Lords at the end of that month. On 27 February 1641 the Irish House of Commons began impeachment proceedings against Radcliffe, Bramhall, Lord Chancellor Richard Bolton, and Lord Chief Justice Gerard Lowther, all potential witnesses in Strafford's defence. Radcliffe was not brought to trial in either country, but during the trial of Strafford in March 1641 he was alleged to have threatened MPs Sir John Clotworthy and Nicholas Barnewall following their opposition to the government. His role in the prosecution of Sir Piers Crosby was raised, and Crosby and Lord Baltinglass presented petitions against him. When Strafford pointed out that he had not been in Ireland when the alleged intimidation of Barnewall took place, Pym observed that &#145;the Spirit of my lord of Strafford could move in Sir George Radcliffe, whensoever it was spoken&#146;  (Rushworth, 112). The earl of Clarendon noted that the purpose of the impeachment of Radcliffe was to render him incapable of giving evidence on Strafford's behalf and he was barred from assisting Strafford in preparing his response to the Irish remonstrance. On the king's order, however, a copy of the Irish remonstrance was sent to Radcliffe in January 1641 and later that month his answer was delivered to Strafford, &#145;who sent his Majesty word that he had perused it and did avow and would humbly abide by it&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1640&#150;41</i>, 433).<br>
<br>In his last letter to Strafford, Radcliffe promised his faithful service to the earl's family, and in July 1641 he was acknowledged by the earl's brother, Sir George Wentworth, as the only person in England acquainted with Strafford's estate business. In 1641&#150;2 correspondence passed between Radcliffe and Strafford's heir, William Wentworth, Lord Raby, later second earl; later on Radcliffe wrote to William telling him of his intention to write a life of Strafford, and sending him a plan of the work  (Radcliffe, <span class="italic">Earl of Strafforde's Letters</span>, 2.429&#150;36). He appears to have drafted further sections that can be read in Cooper's edition of the earl's early correspondence (Wentworth, 319&#150;26), and these two pieces provide important information on some aspects of Strafford's private life, and on the origins and nature of Radcliffe's relationship with the earl. It was, no doubt, a source of much regret to Radcliffe that by the 1650s, if not before, the second earl appears to have lost interest in him.<br>
<br>Radcliffe was released from prison in June 1642 but his whereabouts during the rest of that year are not known. In 1643 he joined the king at Oxford, and was created a doctor of law by the university in October. His correspondence with James Butler, marquess of Ormond, in 1643&#150;4 shows him still to have been handling some Irish matters. He was refused a pardon by parliament in both the Uxbridge and the Newcastle propositions, and following the surrender of Oxford he took charge of James, duke of York. Lacking an order from the king, he chose not to take the duke abroad but handed him over to the earl of Northumberland. From 1647 onwards he lived mainly in France. In June 1648 he sailed with Edward Hyde and Cottington to join the prince of Wales's fleet, but their ship was captured by an Ostend corsair, who robbed Radcliffe and a member of the Wandesford family of money and jewellery. Having reached Paris, Radcliffe attached himself to the duke of York, alleging the instruction of the late king. In October 1650, according to Clarendon, he encouraged James to visit the duke of Lorraine in Brussels and then to travel to The Hague, both against the wishes of Queen Henrietta Maria. While in Brussels Radcliffe took control of the duke's household, and upon hearing rumours of Charles II's death, allegedly began to direct the duke's affairs as though he were now king. He seems to have regained Charles II's favour to some extent in 1654 following his key role in preventing the attempted conversion of the duke of Gloucester to the Roman Catholic faith. This incident, however, added to the queen's hostility towards him.<br>
<br>By early 1655 Radcliffe was very weary of his situation, complaining to Secretary Sir Edward Nicholas that the duke of York no longer consulted him and that the queen continued to speak ill of him: he was, he claimed, &#145;an eysore to some and useless to all&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 2.265). His letters to his wife, written the following year and intercepted by John Thurloe, contain similar sentiments. By this time he appears to have had difficulty in paying for much-needed new clothes, although he refused his wife's offer of money. In September 1656 he left Paris and joined the exiled court in the Low Countries. He died at Flushing on 22 May 1657 and was buried there three days later. According to an intelligence report &#145;all the cavaliers were at his burial, except the chancellor and two more that was at Bruges. They are generally sorry for him; for they say he was the best counsellor their master had&#146;  (Thurloe, 6.325), a comment that does not fully reflect the general view of Radcliffe held by some of his fellow exiles. Clarendon portrayed him as &#145;a man very capable of business; and if the prosperity of his former fortunes had not raised in him some fumes of vanity and self-conceitedness, very fit to be advised with, being of a nature constant and sincere&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of &hellip; Clarendon</span>, 1.244). Christopher Hatton, Lord Hatton, sent Nicholas a similarly mixed assessment, claiming that Radcliffe's &#145;vanity in blabbing and feare to offend heere is able to spoile all his honest endeavors&#146;; Nicholas himself described Radcliffe as &#145;a very busy and meddling person and none of the most secret or the most discreet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 1.292; 2.134). It is perhaps not surprising that Radcliffe was not on good terms with Hyde, whom he no doubt regarded as partly responsible for the destruction of the council of the north. His bitter relationship with Henry Jermyn, Lord Jermyn, was also caused at least in part by old animosities between Strafford and the queen's circle. With Ormond, however, he seems to have remained on very good terms. Radcliffe was survived by his second wife, who died &#145;aged fifty-eight&#146; on 13 May 1659, and was buried in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey. Their son Thomas held a seat on the Irish council and died unmarried and childless in Dublin in 1679.<br>
