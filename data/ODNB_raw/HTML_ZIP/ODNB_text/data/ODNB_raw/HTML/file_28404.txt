<span class="headword">Wait,  Daniel Guildford</span>  (1789&#150;1850), <span class="occ">Hebrew scholar</span>, was born in Bristol on 5 November 1789, the eldest son of Daniel Wait (<i>d</i>. 1813), a banker who was mayor of Bristol in 1805 and founder of the Bristol Docks Company, and his wife, Mary. He matriculated from University College, Oxford, in 1809 but left in 1811; he was subsequently admitted in 1813 at St John's College, Cambridge, where he held the status of a fellow-commoner and graduated LLB in 1819 and LLD in 1824. He appears to have become a close friend of the organist Samuel Wesley (1766&#150;1837) in Cambridge. While an undergraduate he married, on 10 February 1814, Priscilla Morgan Thorne, daughter of George Thorne, one of his father's banking partners; they had at least two children. He was ordained as curate in Pucklechurch, near Bristol, and on 12 March 1819 became rector of Blagdon in Somerset. Following the death of his first wife he married, on 15 December 1819, Eliza Wylde (<i>d</i>. 1864), with whom he had numerous children.<br>
<br>Wait's first scholarly contribution was his <span class="italic">Defence of a Critique of the Hebrew Word Nachash</span> (1811), in which he defended the conclusion that Eve was deceived by a serpent and not by an ape, as Adam Clarke had suggested in the <span class="italic">Classical, Biblical, and Oriental Journal</span>. His most important work, however, was <span class="italic">Jewish, Oriental, and Classical Antiquities</span>, which appeared in 1823. He also translated the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> from the German of Leonard Van Hug into English, though his translation was superseded by that of Moses Stuart in 1836. Wait was essentially a comparatist, comparing Jewish scriptures with the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and looking at the influence of Hebrew texts on non-Christian philosophers. In addition he published sermons and psalms, and edited <span class="italic">Repertorium Theologicum</span> (1829), of which only one edition was printed. He periodically resided at his Cambridge college, and in 1825 he was appointed to catalogue the oriental manuscripts in Cambridge University Library, but he appears never to have embarked upon the task.<br>
<br>Wait's tenure as rector of Blagdon was controversial. His sermon preached at the first service held at the new church there, in April 1823, alluded to schism in the parish. A greater problem was his growing indebtedness, the causes of which remain uncertain: the charitable explanation was that his absorption in Hebrew texts caused him to neglect his financial affairs, though the scale of his debts (reckoned in 1832 to be &pound;8000) pointed to more than oversight. In 1829 the proceeds of Blagdon rectory (valued at &pound;500 a year) were sequestered by one of his creditors, and a curate was appointed to undertake his duties. Wait was imprisoned in Fleet debtors prison in 1832, but was discharged early in 1833 under the <span class="roman">Act for Relief of Insolvent Debtors</span>. His claims for assistance from the Royal Literary Fund, in March and June 1834, were rejected on grounds of bad character; he then complained of calumnies spread about him. Caught between the conflicting demands of Wait's creditors and their liability for poor rates and taxes for the rectory as well as the arrears of salary due to the curate, the parishioners and tithe payers of Blagdon petitioned the House of Lords in 1835 to inquire into the case. George Law, the bishop of Bath and Wells, regretted that he was legally powerless to intervene and, as to Wait, &#145;would say nothing, because he could say nothing good of him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 April 1835).<br>
<br>Wait died of heart disease at the rectory, Blagdon, on 30 September 1850 and was buried under the chancel of the parish church, where there is a memorial inscription. His widow survived him, along with eight of their children, six of whom were dependants; the Royal Literary Fund awarded her &pound;50.<br>
