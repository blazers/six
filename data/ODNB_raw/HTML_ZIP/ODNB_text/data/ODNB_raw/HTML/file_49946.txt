<span class="headword">Rose, Sir  Alec Richard</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">yachtsman</span>, was born on 13 July 1908 at 4 Kings Terrace, Lansdown Road, Canterbury, the son of Ambrose Rose, a laundry engineer, and his wife, Louisa Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holness. He was educated at Simon Langton School, Canterbury. After leaving school at the age of fifteen he wanted to become a deckhand, but he was rejected as too small, partly a result of being delicate as a child. When he was twenty he went to Canada, where he spent three years working on farms before returning to assist his father, who had become a haulage contractor. On Easter Monday (28 March) 1932 he married (Hannah) Barbara Kathleen Baldwin, a bookkeeper, and the daughter of George Arthur Baldwin. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In the Second World War, Rose fulfilled his youthful ambition to go to sea by joining the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and, as a lieutenant engineer, saw service escorting Atlantic convoys and on landing craft during the Normandy invasion. He was invalided out in 1945. His first marriage having ended in divorce in 1959, on 21 May 1960 he married Dorothy Mabel Walker, another bookkeeper, and the daughter of Frederick William Walker, a builder. By this time he had retired from the nurseryman's business that he had established after the war, and in 1961 he and his wife, Dorothy, opened a greengrocer's shop in Southsea.<br>
<br>Rose first took up recreational sailing in 1959 at the time of his marital breakdown, and bought a lifeboat, which he spent several years converting. At the time of his second marriage in 1960 he was actually living on board the vessel, <i>Neptune's Daughter</i>, in Ramsgate harbour. He and Dorothy honeymooned on the boat in a choppy Bay of Biscay. Sailing soon became more serious, and it culminated in his single-handed circumnavigation of the globe in 1967&#150;8. Although many of the sailing fraternity believe that his greatest seafaring achievement was the thirty-six-day crossing which brought him fourth place in the 1964 <span class="italic">Observer</span> single-handed transatlantic race, the public acclaimed him for his round-the-world voyage. He was not the first, nor the fastest, but his feat, by an ordinary man in an elderly boat, captured the public imagination.<br>
<br>Rose bought his Indian-built, 36 foot ketch the <i>Lively Lady</i> in 1963 for &pound;250. At the time of his circumnavigation the boat was thirty years old, not custom-designed by naval architects, and was 20 feet shorter than Francis Chichester's <i>Gipsy Moth IV</i>. A shoestring sailor, he was unsponsored&#151;indeed he did not seek sponsorship&#151;and paid for everything himself. He considered the voyage a private affair, designed to satisfy his own ambition and provide a chance to see his second son's family in Melbourne. He had intended to set off before Chichester in 1966, but on the second night out his boat was hit by a freighter in the channel; then, after repairs, it fell away from the harbour wall at low tide and was severely damaged again. Thus his circumnavigation did not start until 16 July 1967. 354 days later, shortly before his sixtieth birthday, more than 250,000 spectators saw him land at Portsmouth, where he was greeted with the news of a knighthood. The 28,500 mile voyage, during which for five months he did not sight land, had been dramatic at times. He faced a succession of gales, nearly lost a mast in the Antarctic, and was rendered unconscious by fumes when repairing a leaking exhaust.<br>
<br>When asked about the thrill of sailing alone, Rose said, when his boat rode over the great curling waves coming straight at him, &#145;My heart warms. My blood tingles and I feel a great happiness welling up in me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 14 Jan 1991). Shy and quietly spoken, he was a man of courage, perseverance, endurance, and, by all accounts, modesty. He was self-effacing and laconic: his entry under the category recreations in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> reads &#145;sailing (inc. circumnavigation of the world)&#146;. <i>Lively Lady</i> was presented to the Maritime Trust and became a showpiece at the Liverpool Maritime Museum. Rose sold his Southsea shop in 1971 and retired to Havant where he sailed for fun around the Solent. In 1969 he launched the national membership scheme of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, for whom he remained a tireless fund-raiser, and in 1975 he was awarded a life governorship. He died of heart disease on 11 January 1991 at the Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, survived by his wife, Dorothy, and the four children of his first marriage.<br>
