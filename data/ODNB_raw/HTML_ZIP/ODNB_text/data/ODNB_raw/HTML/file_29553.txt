<span class="headword">Williams,  Thomas</span>  (1760&#150;1844), <span class="occ">hymn writer</span>, son of Richard and Margaret Williams, was born at Trerhedyn, in the parish of Pendeulwyn, Glamorgan. At a very early age he joined the Calvinistic Methodist society which met in the district. On 10 July 1790 he married Jane Morgan of Brewis, and thereupon settled as a farmer, in easy circumstances, at Fonmon in south Glamorgan.<br>
<br>The controversy which led to the expulsion of Peter Williams from the Methodist body on charges of heresy was keenly waged in the society to which Thomas Williams belonged, and about 1792 he and others who sympathized with the expelled divine formed a separate church, unconnected with any other religious body, at Aberthaw, not far from Fonmon. On 3 June 1798 this congregation formally appointed him as its pastor. Williams's first published work was a (Welsh) elegy upon Peter Williams (1796). In 1806, when Williams moved to Flemingston, his congregation built in the parish of Llantwit Major a chapel which became known as Bethesda'r Fro (&#145;Bethesda of the vale&#146;), and in 1814 church and pastor were received into the Congregational denomination. W. J. Gruffydd's short story &#145;Bethesda'r Fro&#146; (1940) imagines Thomas Williams having, in 1820, a premonition of the quiet village becoming an industrial centre.<br>
<br>In 1812 Williams published a small volume of hymns entitled <span class="italic">Llais y durtur yn y wlad</span>; this was reissued, with large additions, in 1824 as <span class="italic">Dyfroedd Bethesda</span> (&#145;Waters of Bethesda&#146;), and a third edition, with the same title, followed in 1841. <span class="italic">Perl mewn adfyd</span> (1814) was also a collection of hymns. Some of Williams's best-known hymns are &#145;Y g&#373;r ar ffynnon Jacob&#146; (&#145;The man by Jacob's fountain&#146;), &#145;O'th flaen, o Dduw, 'rwy'n dyfod&#146; (&#145;Oh God, I come before thee&#146;), and &#145;Adenydd fel c'lomen pe cawn&#146; (&#145;Had I but the wings of a dove&#146;). Elegies written by Williams, and published in pamphlet form in 1817, 1828, and 1830, are extant, and his elegy on John Williams of St Athans is notable. Contemporaries spoke of his handsome presence, his emotional temperament, and the influence which his career and social standing gave him among the nonconformists of south Glamorgan. After the death of his wife on 24 October 1827 Williams in his depression gave up the ministry. He died at Flemingston on 23 November 1844.<br>
<br>Williams's poetical works were published in one volume at Hafod in 1882. His fame rests upon his hymns, many of which are still in high favour among Welsh congregations. As Thomas Parry has observed, Williams's hymns evolved from the emotionalism of the Methodist revival  (Parry, 319). They are of some literary importance because they show an ease with free metre which was little in evidence in secular poetry until the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
