<span class="headword">Kellas,  Alexander Mitchell</span>  (1868&#150;1921), <span class="occ">chemist and mountaineer</span>, was born on 21 June 1868 at 28 Regent Quay, Aberdeen, the son of James Fowler Kellas, secretary to the local marine board, and his wife, Mary Boyd, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mitchell. He was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and then attended Aberdeen University, Heriot-Watt College in Edinburgh, and Heidelberg University, where he gained a PhD. He was for a period assistant to Sir William Ramsay at University College and taught chemistry to medical students at the Middlesex Hospital. Kellas was keenly interested in chemistry and even more enthusiastic for mountaineering. The two interests combined to make him pre-eminent for a time in the field of high-altitude physiology. He was able to combine research at low pressure in the laboratory with practical studies at altitude in the Himalayas.<br>
<br>Kellas had a great love for wild mountain places. He was not given to technical climbing but was supremely interested in mountain geography and exploration, in the course of which he reached numerous unclimbed Himalayan summits. He began mountaineering in the Cairngorms while a student at Aberdeen University. During the next few years he came to know most of the highlands and at the same period climbed in Switzerland.<br>
<br>In his late thirties Kellas made his first visit to the Himalayas. He made six expeditions to Sikkim from 1907 to 1920. He did a phenomenal amount of climbing and yet very little is known about him because he was of a retiring nature and wrote so little of his remarkable, if not unique, achievements. Unusual in that he generally climbed without European companions, he was accompanied by an ever loyal group of local porters whom he trained in the basic alpine skills. He possessed phenomenal energy and tenacity: during one season in 1910 he made ten first ascents above 20,000 feet, including Sentinel Peak (21,292 feet), Pauhunri (23,375 feet), and Chomoyummo (22,400 feet). In 1909 he had twice attempted to climb Pauhunri, getting within 200 feet of the top. The summit was obviously important enough for him to return in the following year in order eventually to reach it.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Kellas channelled all his energies into high-altitude research and the effect of diminished atmospheric pressure on human physiology, a subject of great importance to the Air Ministry. Several papers were published in the <span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>, including &#145;A consideration of the possibility of ascending the loftier Himalaya&#146;, which concluded that &#145;a man in first-rate training, acclimatized to maximum possible altitude, could make the ascent of Mount Everest without adventitious aids, provided that the physical difficulties above 25,000 feet are not prohibitive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Geographical Journal</span>, 49, January 1917). Seventy years later this observation became reality, with Messner and Habeler making the first ascent of Everest without &#145;canned&#146; oxygen.<br>
<br>In 1919 Kellas suffered a breakdown in health from overwork, resigned his lectureship in London, and returned to Aberdeen. To the surprise of his friends he recovered the following year and set out again for the Himalayas to carry out more experiments at altitude on himself and his high-altitude porters (or &#145;coolies&#146; as they were termed at the time). He reached a height of 23,622 feet on Kamet. Although he reached Mead's Col, he could not persuade his porters to pitch camp in the intense cold. After several months in the Garhwal he travelled over to Sikkim, where in November 1920 he climbed north of the Kang La to obtain photographs of the peaks north of Everest that were then unknown.<br>
<br>Amazingly Kellas returned to the Kang La region in April 1921 and climbed a higher peak to see more of Everest's north side. He then climbed Narsingh (19,110 feet) before turning his attention to working out a way through the icefall on Kabru. He had time to reach only 21,000 feet. He returned to Darjeeling just one week before he was to join the first expedition to Mount Everest, led by Charles Kenneth Howard-Bury.<br>
<br>Kellas was chosen to be a member of the climbing team of four. This may seem surprising considering he was fifty-three. The Everest committee had few reservations, despite his age, because he had far more experience of high-altitude climbing than any contemporary. No other climber had such a grasp of the mysteries of the effects of rarefied air upon humans. He had alone built up a good rapport with the Sherpa Bhotias hill men and, by emphasizing the importance of adequate training and of treating them with respect, had shown their value to any mountaineering enterprise.<br>
<br>After only a week of rest from his attempts to see more of the Everest region and his prolonged work on Kabru, Kellas had no time to recuperate properly for the rigours of the Tibetan plateau. He went down with dysentery and had to be carried on a stretcher. Just before Kampa Dzong the accumulated strain of his spring climbing, the biting cold of the plateau, and rampant dysentery overtaxed his heart. He died, on 5 June 1921, among his faithful porters, as he had insisted his countrymen went on ahead. &#145;The old gentleman (such he seemed) was obliged to retire a number of times en route and could not bear to be seen in this distress&#146; as Mallory, appalled at the situation, wrote at the time  (Unsworth, 37).<br>
<br>Kellas was buried on a hillside to the south of Kampa Dzong in sight of the peaks of Sikkim, where he had made so many first ascents. From the same place the summit of Everest was visible 100 miles to the west. Howard-Bury concluded, &#145;He lies, therefore, within sight of his greatest feats in climbing and within view of the mountains that he had longed for so many years to approach&#151;a fitting resting place for a great mountaineer&#146;  (Howard-Bury, 54).<br>
