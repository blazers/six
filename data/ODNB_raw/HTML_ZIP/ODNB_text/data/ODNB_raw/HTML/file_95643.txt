<span class="headword">Burt,  William Mathew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1725&#150;1781), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born at Elim in Jamaica, the first of fourteen children of Colonel William Pym Burt (<i>d</i>. 1750), a planter in Nevis, and subsequently chief justice and treasurer of St Kitts, and his second wife, Louisa, only daughter of Sir William Mathew, captain general and governor of the Leeward Islands, and his wife, Katherine Remee, <i>n&eacute;e</i> van Leembutt, who was a maid of honour to Mary II. He was the great-grandson of William Burt, who left England in 1635 and became deputy governor of Nevis in 1685.<br>
<br>Burt's early years were spent in St Kitts, where he was a member of the council from 1745 to 1755. He was well thought of, and in 1751 the St Kitts assembly resolved <i>nemine contradicente</i> that:<blockquote>it is the opinion of this House that the Honourable William Mathew Burt Esq, President of His Majesty's Council in this island, &hellip; did execute this command with great justice, prudence, diligence and integrity to the general satisfaction of all the people of this island and has constantly behaved as a person qualified and fitting for such command. (minutes of the St Kitts assembly meeting, 25 Feb 1751, TNA: PRO, CO 241/6, section 12, p. 19)</blockquote>Some members of the assembly were not completely happy with this eulogy, and at the next meeting it was decided to add the words &#145;with great loyalty and zeal for His Majesty's service&#146;  (minutes of the St Kitts assembly meeting, 4 March 1751, ibid. section 13, p. 3).<br>
<br>With the islanders' praises ringing in his ears Burt moved to England and acquired a country estate at Maiden Earley, near Reading. In reply to an enquiry from the secretary to the lords commissioners for trade and plantations he wrote from Bond Street with some asperity &#145;tis not my intention to return for some years to St Christophers. I am perfectly satisfied with the propriety of this determination&#146;  (Burt to the lords commissioners, 26 July 1755, TNA: PRO, CO 152/28, bundle Bb62, p. 149). The lords commissioners consequently decided to replace him on the St Kitts council with someone else. On 29 August 1754, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, he married Sarah (1727&#150;1781), the daughter of Colonel John Foster of Jamaica. They had three children: Elizabeth, Louisa, and Charles Pym.<br>
<br>When the Seven Years' War broke out, Burt was consulted by the British cabinet and was involved in planning the British expedition that attacked first Martinique and then Guadeloupe in 1759, eventually capturing the latter, where Burt was sent as crown agent. He returned to England, and was elected MP for Great Marlow in 1761. His first speech in the Commons was described by James Harris as &#145;dull as far as could be heard&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1754&#150;90</span>, 164), and he was later accused by Harris of rambling &#145;from Africa to America&#146;  (ibid.). In 1768 he contested Great Marlow again and was badly defeated. By then he was a wealthy man, owning a town house in London as well as his manor at Maiden Earley and property in St Kitts. He also owned land on Prince Edward Island.<br>
<br>In 1776 Burt was appointed captain-general, governor, and commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands. With a liking for military matters, he devoted much of his energy to warlike preparations and, when the long-expected war with France started, he found good opportunity for indulging his taste. Dominica was captured by the French in September 1778, and St Kitts was thought to be their next objective. Burt took energetic steps to prepare the defence of the island but he was frequently at odds with the house of assembly. With the aid of slaves from government supporters and his own money he built storehouses, roofed Charles Fort, built carriages for the serviceable cannon, and bought ammunition and provisions that he stored at Brimstone Hill. When the expected attack did not take place and the time came for paying for the stores, the house of assembly refused to foot the bill.<br>
<br>Burt was thanked by the king for his services and promised a peerage but died suddenly at Antigua on 27 January 1781 between four and five o'clock in the morning, apparently in a state of delirium. He was buried on the island. There were rumours that he had been poisoned. He had by then become very unpopular and was said to have been something of a martinet, with an irascible temper. In January 1782, a year after his death, the long-expected attack on St Kitts came. Brimstone Hill was inadequately prepared and, after a gallant but fruitless defence, surrendered. The British flag was lowered, and the fleur-de-lis waved for a while over St Kitts.<br>
<br>Fifty years after Burt's death his grandson, William Mathew Hansard, petitioned the king, on the grounds that the bills for fortifying Brimstone Hill and supplying it with provisions and ammunition, estimated at &pound;7,381 19<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>., had fallen entirely on Burt and had never been repaid, and that this had ruined Burt's descendants. But the British government, in the form of Viscount Goderich, turned a deaf ear.<br>
