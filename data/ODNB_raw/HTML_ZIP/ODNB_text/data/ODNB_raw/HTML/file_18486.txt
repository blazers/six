<span class="headword">O'Meara <span class="st"> [Meara]</span>,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1681), <span class="occ">physician</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18485/', "Dermot O'Meara (fl. c.1614&#150;1642)")</script>, physician to the earls of Ormond, was born in Ormond, co. Tipperary, Ireland. Educated at Oxford and abroad Edmund became MD of Rheims (1636); he may have been a member of the Dublin Fraternity of Physicians established in 1654, a forerunner of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, but the roll for the period in question is incomplete. He was elected honorary fellow of the College of Physicians, London (1664). He was medical adviser to the earl of Clanricarde. Like his father, Edmund O'Meara had a talent for Latin verses: he exchanged epigrams with Rinnucini, the papal nuncio, and wrote epitaphs for two archbishops of Tuam. The Cromwellian plantation obliged him to leave Ireland and practise medicine in London; he moved later to Bath and Bristol. After the Restoration he initiated a petition for the return of his confiscated estates in co. Wicklow. Prospects for a successful decision seemed favourable provided he could prove good title to the lands, and that these had not been given to adventurers or soldiers. Contrary to his expectations his claim was dismissed on 28 February 1663 by the commissioners of settlement. Leave to appeal was granted, and it is believed by Patrick Logan that the second petition was successful.<br>
<br>O'Meara's <span class="italic">Examen diatribae Thomae Willisy</span> (1665), dedicated to Sir Kenelm Digby, was reprinted in Amsterdam (1666). Additional to its attack on Willis's <span class="italic">De febribus</span> it contains &#145;medicae rariores&#146;, descriptions of nineteen unusual cases which he had seen in Bristol, and includes a reprint of his father's <span class="italic">Pathologia haereditaria generalis</span>, the first medical book printed in Dublin (1619). The engraved frontispiece of Edmund's <span class="italic">Examen</span> displays a glow-worm in sunlight and a motto, &#145;Useless in the light&#146;; below, the same little creature is seen &#145;shining in the dark&#146;. The polemic against Willis evoked the displeasure of Richard Lower, an Oxford physiologist, who responded so quickly with <span class="italic">Vindicatio diatribae Willisii</span> (1665) that Kenneth Dewhurst, its translator, suggested that Lower, prone to mood swings, may have been then in a hypomanic state. Later, in his <span class="italic">Tractatus corde</span>, Lower, still incensed, referred to ignoramuses who obstructed scientific progress with inept criticisms, among whom he included &#145;Meara quidam Hybernus&#146;. The motivation of O'Meara's attack on Willis is unclear, but may represent the disturbed feelings of a traditionalist who followed doctrines advocated by Galen. His animadversions were supported by his fellow-countryman Conlis Cassin MD, whose book bore a title which may be translated: &#145;Willis badly vindicated, or an Oxford doctor found out in untruthfulness and ignorance&#146;.<br>
<br>O'Meara returned to Dublin in 1666 and was in demand as a consultant. The association between the O'Mearas and the Butlers of Ormond was re-established in 1674 when Edmund was called as second opinion in an illness of James, duke of Ormond. He expressed the opinion that diet and exercise alone would be insufficient&#151;bleeding in early spring was an absolute necessity, and mineral waters might be taken in either England or Ireland. He also advised that the patient be given &#145;the spleen broth used by my Lady of Thurles by Dr. Fennell's direction&#146;  (Logan, 315). He believed that the underlying disorder emanated from the spleen, and was unlikely to be fully relieved in one season.<br>
<br>O'Meara died in Dublin in 1681, survived by his wife, Cathleen, his daughter, Martha, and three sons&#151;William, who was also a physician and prefixed Latin verses to the 1666 edition of his father's <span class="italic">Examen</span>; Edmund, a Jesuit; and Francis. The latter, who was the second son, was named a burgess in James II's charter of 1687 to the town of Wicklow, and was granted a commission of horse in Tyrconnel's regiment in the same year. He was sheriff of co. Wicklow in 1688, and was killed at the battle of the Boyne, being then a major, on 1 July 1690.<br>
