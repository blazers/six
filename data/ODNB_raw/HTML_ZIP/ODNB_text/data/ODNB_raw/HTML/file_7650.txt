<span class="headword">Dillingham,  Theophilus</span>  (1613&#150;1678), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born on 18 October 1613 at Over Deane, Bedfordshire, the elder son of Thomas Dillingham (<i>d</i>. 1647), rector of that parish. He was educated at the school at Over Deane and then matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 13 September 1629. From that college he graduated BA in 1634 and proceeded MA in 1637. The following year he moved to Sidney Sussex College as a fellow, taking his BD there in 1644.<br>
<br>In 1654 Dillingham was elected master of Clare and proceeded DD from that college the following year. At the Restoration he was ejected from the mastership, but the successful claimant, Thomas Paske (<i>d</i>. 1662), who had been master from 1620 to 1645, became his father-in-law on 30 March 1661 on Dillingham's marriage to Elisabeth Paske at St Edward's, Cambridge. With the assent of the fellows Paske resigned his mastership to Dillingham. His popularity within the university both before and after the Restoration is evident in the fact that he served as vice-chancellor in 1655&#150;6, 1656&#150;7, and 1662. Evidently, too, he was not out of favour with the restored regime, since he became prebendary of Ulleskelf, in the church of York, on 29 January 1661 (a position he again owed to the fact that his father-in-law resigned in his favour) and archdeacon of Bedford on 3 September 1667, as well as retaining the rectory of Offord Cluny, Huntingdonshire (to which he was appointed in 1654), until 1678.<br>
<br>Dillingham died at Cambridge on 22 November 1678 and was buried at St Edward's Church, Cambridge. He was survived by his wife, three sons (Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1722), John, and Theophilus), and three daughters (Elizabeth, Dorothy, and Ann).<br>
