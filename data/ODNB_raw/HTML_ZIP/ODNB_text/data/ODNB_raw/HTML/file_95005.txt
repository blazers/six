<span class="headword">Tennyson,  (Frederick) Penrose <span class="st"> [Pen]</span></span>  (1912&#150;1941), <span class="occ">film director</span>, was born at 22 Carlyle Square, London, on 26 August 1912, the eldest of three sons of Sir Charles Bruce Locker Tennyson (1879&#150;1977), barrister and legal adviser to the Colonial Office, and his wife, Ivy Gladys, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pretious (1880&#150;1958). On his father's side he was a great-grandson of two poets: the poet laureate Alfred Tennyson, and Frederick Locker-Lampson. His father, who became secretary to the recently formed Federation of British Industries and then from 1928 to 1948 company secretary of the Dunlop Rubber Company, was knighted in 1945 for his efforts to improve industrial design as chairman of the Board of Trade utility furniture committee. His mother, who had been brought up by the positivists Frederic and Ethel Harrison, became secretary to Emily Hobhouse during her campaigning against the Boer War. She succeeded Emily's brother Leonard Hobhouse as salaried secretary to the Free Trade Union until her marriage in 1909, and as an active member of the Women's Anti-Suffrage League helped to edit the <span class="italic">Anti-Suffrage Review</span>. In 1918 she was awarded the OBE for her war work in charge of women workers employed by the Ministry of Munitions.<br>
<br>Penrose Tennyson, usually known as Pen, was educated at Scaitcliffe preparatory school and then Eton College, from where he won an exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford. He spent six months in Switzerland improving his French and widening his reading before taking up residence at the university in October 1931. He read history but, distracted by a love affair and having failed his first examination, he decided&#151;in spite of the support he had from the college dean, the renowned &#145;Sligger&#146; Urquhart&#151;to leave and find employment. He was aided by his mother, who persuaded C. M. Woolf, manager of the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation, to take him on. In May 1932 he began work at the Lime Grove Studios. There he quickly impressed the producer Michael Balcon, who did much to advance his career.<br>
<br>Tennyson made two short travelogues, on Sandwich and York, and was assistant director to Alfred Hitchcock on five films, including <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">The 39 Steps</span> (1935), in the latter of which he was the &#145;double&#146; for Madeleine Carroll &#145;in a blonde wig and a dress&#146;  (Balcon, &#145;Sub-Lieutenant F. Penrose Tennyson&#146;, 194). Loaned out to another company, as the assistant director on <span class="italic">Farewell Again</span> (1937), he sailed to Aden and Egypt with a camera crew to take &#145;atmosphere&#146; shots. When financial difficulties beset Gaumont-British he moved with Balcon to join MGM's project to make films in Britain. This enabled him to widen his experience as assistant director of <span class="italic">The Citadel</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">A Yank at Oxford</span> (1938). When Balcon took the position of studio head at Ealing Studios, Tennyson again went with him. Both were to have the opportunity to make what they regarded as indigenously British films.<br>
<br>Slightly built and tousle-haired, Tennyson found time for the traditional upper-class recreations of fox-hunting, shooting, and sailing. He combined this with a nonconformity that led him to become supportive of the Soviet Union and sympathetic to the unprivileged sections of society. He was one of the earliest members of the Association of Cine-Technicians after its formation in 1933 and acted as the secretary of the Gaumont-British Studio branch.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1938 Tennyson began directing his first film, a boxing drama, <span class="italic">There Ain't No Justice</span>, based on a recently published novel by James Curtis (the pseudonym of Geoffrey Maiden). Modestly financed and set in London's East End, it was part-scripted by Tennyson (as were his two later films). On its release in the summer of 1939 it was not given a West End showing, nor was it much discussed by film critics. On 19 October 1939 he married, at Caxton Hall, London. His wife was the actress (Margery) Nova Pilbeam (1919&#150;205), the daughter of Arnold William Pilbeam, theatre manager. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>To achieve a naturalistic effect in <span class="italic">There Ain't No Justice</span>, Tennyson had avoided better-known actors and recruited extras from the Cockney neighbourhoods he sought to evoke. In his next film, <span class="italic">The Proud Valley</span>, the leading man was the American actor and singer Paul Robeson. Tennyson had to place him in the context of a Welsh village affected by the closure of its coalmine. The storyline of the film, devised by the socialist theatre director Herbert P. J. Marshall and the latter's wife, Fredda Brilliant, had proposed an epic of working-class life, showing the hardships and solidarities of miners who reopen their mine to operate it as a workers' co-operative. Four authors contributed to the final script. As well as Tennyson, the film's associate producer, Sergei Nolbandov, was credited as an author along with two novelists, Louis Golding and Jack Jones; the latter was also drafted in to play the part of one of the miners, Ned Thomas.<br>
<br>Filming began in August 1939. Within a couple of weeks the war broke out and several of the production team were called up. Tennyson had to find replacements and modify the script. The reopening of the mine became a joint effort of the workers and the owners. Symbolically both Robeson's character, David Goliath, and the mining engineer sent by the owners to survey the pit sacrifice their lives to save others. As old divisions are superseded by the national interest Ned Thomas declares &#145;to hell with Hitler!&#146; and in the final scene the villagers cheer as wagons of coal, now vital in helping to win the war, are brought to the surface. On its release in March 1940 critical opinion was divided, but in a longer perspective <span class="italic">The Proud Valley</span> has been termed &#145;the first in the Ealing cycle of war-effort films&#146;  (Barr, 20). Its combination of documentary realism, propaganda, humour, and ordinary people dealing with extraordinary situations anticipated, for example, <span class="italic">The Foreman Went to France</span> (1942), <span class="italic">The Bells Go Down</span> (1943), and <span class="italic">San Demetrio London</span> (1943).<br>
<br>Similar characteristics mark Tennyson's third film, <span class="italic">Convoy</span>. As well as a morale-raising story of a British cruiser escorting merchant ships across the Atlantic, Tennyson's script included a romantic triangle about two officers, played by Clive Brook and John Clements, involved with the same woman (Judy Campbell). Clements's caddish character redeems himself by giving his life for his ship and country. After its opening in July 1940 <span class="italic">Convoy</span> became one of the most successful British films of that year  (Barr, 22). As well as making a good profit it was generally well received by the critics. A naval adviser assisted with the technical details, and facilities were provided for Tennyson to be on board HMS <i>Valorous</i> as it sailed in convoy from Scotland down the east coast. His script gave those below decks &#145;a raw vitality which contrasts favourably with the stiff formalities of the upper deck&#146;  (Murphy, 24).<br>
<br>For several years Tennyson had been a member of the Royal Naval Supplementary Reserve. He could, to make another film, have sought exemption from war service, but decided not to do so, and in June 1940 he began six weeks of training before he was posted, as third officer, to an anti-submarine trawler. Later that year the Admiralty appointed him to head its instructional film unit based at Portsmouth. His first film was a short piece of propaganda intended for American armament workers. By the summer of 1941 he was making a film that required location work at Scapa Flow. On 7 July 1941 he began a journey back to London, the first leg of which involved a flight to Rosyth. The small Fleet Air Arm plane in which he was travelling crashed into a mountainside, killing all passengers and crew. His remains were buried in the naval plot of Dunfermline (Douglas Bank) cemetery. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the Fields on 24 July. In 1950 his widow married a BBC journalist, Alexander Whyte.<br>
<br>Pen's brother (Charles) Julian Tennyson (1915&#150;1945), author of <span class="italic">Suffolk Scene: a Book of Description and Adventure</span> (1939), which was widely praised for its evocation of that county, was commissioned in the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry and was killed during the Burma campaign. The youngest brother, (Beryl) Hallam Augustine Tennyson (1920&#150;2005), refused to take a combatant role in the Second World War, but joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit. Hallam's homosexuality placed him outside the conventional attitudes of the time. He wrote about it with great frankness in his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Haunted Mind</span> (1984), in which he also expressed the admiration he had for his father and the dislike of his mother. From 1955 to 1979 he worked at the BBC, becoming assistant head of radio drama. His death from knife wounds at his flat in Highgate remained an unsolved crime.<br>
