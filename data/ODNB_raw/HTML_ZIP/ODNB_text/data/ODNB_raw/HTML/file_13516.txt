<span class="headword">Holland,  Charles</span>  (1768&#150;1849), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of Thomas Holland of Chiswick, was a nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13515/', "Charles Holland (1733&#150;1769)")</script>, also an actor. After playing for some time in the provinces he appeared at Drury Lane on 31 October 1796, as Marcellus in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. He remained at this theatre until the season of 1819&#150;20, but gained few opportunities and failed to improve his position. Some notice was taken of his opening performance, however, and his Trueman in George Lillo's <span class="italic">The London Merchant</span>, when he supported Sarah Siddons as Millwood, earned him praise. During the illness of Charles Kemble he performed Alonzo in Sheridan's <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, in which piece he was the original Centinel (May 1799). He also attempted John Palmer's character of Sydenham in <span class="italic">The Wheel of Fortune</span> by R. Cumberland, and gradually began to make a name for himself. While at Drury Lane he took many subordinate parts in minor dramas, as well as roles such as Cassio in <span class="italic">Othello</span> and the Dauphin in <span class="italic">King John</span>. In June 1809, as Steinfort in Benjamin Thompson's <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, he made his first appearance at the Haymarket. He went with the Drury Lane company in its move to the Lyceum, and on the opening of the new theatre, on 10 October 1812, was Horatio to R. W. Elliston's Hamlet. Holland supported Edmund Kean in many plays: he was York to the latter's Richard II, the original Mendizabel to his Manuel in Maturin's play <span class="italic">Manuel</span> (1817), and Buckingham to his Richard III (1819). He was the Earl of Angus in <span class="italic">Flodden Field</span>, an adaptation of <span class="italic">Marmion</span>, and Cedric in an adaptation of <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>. In April 1820 he played Gloucester to Kean's Lear, repeating the character on several succeeding nights. Holland was an educated and graceful actor, but his nervousness interfered with his success. He died on 5 December 1849 at St Peter's Cottage, Hammersmith. His sister Elizabeth married Joseph Constantine Carpue.<br>
