<span class="headword">Meritt <span class="st"> [Maetzker]</span>,  Paul John</span>  (1843/4&#150;1895), <span class="occ">playwright and theatre manager</span>, was born in Kiev, Russia. His father, originally from Prague, was a naturalized Briton and sometime private secretary to Sir Edward Earle Gascoyne Bulwer. Although formally his surname remained Maetzker, Paul Meritt always used the Anglicized version. On his father's death in 1854, his Yorkshire-born mother, whose maiden name was Elissens, sent him to school in Leeds, where he was known as Russian Jack. There his juvenile melodrama (&#145;Roderick the Ruthless&#146;), written in 1859&#150;60, earned him a flogging for misuse of school paper. In 1861 he made his acting d&eacute;but at the Theatre Royal in Hull, initially as Wilford in <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> by George Colman the younger, but his main employment was as an office clerk in Leeds and, from 1868, in London. Meritt began writing professionally about 1870 and between 1871 and 1874 was a mainstay author at the Grecian Theatre, where his early sensational melodramas (&#145;works strung together almost at haphazard to please an east-end audience&#146;; Archer, 227) included <span class="italic">Sid, or, The Family Legend</span> (first performed in Doncaster in 1870), <span class="italic">Glin Gath</span>, and the farce <span class="italic">Chopsticks and Spikins</span>.<br>
<br>Meritt could write forceful melodramatic dialogue; but none of his pieces had pretensions to literary quality, an aspiration which he tended to disparage. Probably his greatest success was <span class="italic">The New Babylon</span> (Manchester, 1878; Duke's, 1879), which became the talk of London and ran for 361 performances. It astounded audiences by the verisimilitude, diversity, and brilliance of its settings and effects: a ship collision in mid-Atlantic; representations of Cremorne Gardens, Goodwood racecourse, and the Thames Embankment; and a night scene at the notorious slum of Seven Dials. Equally ingenious and almost as exhilarating was <span class="italic">The World</span> (1880; with Augustus Harris), which drew on familiar plot-lines such as insurance fraud and thwarted family inheritance, set against an especially thrilling shipboard explosion, a nerve-tingling rescue from a raft (which <span class="italic">The Theatre</span> suggested was worthy to &#145;be recorded in the famous annals of melodrama&#146;; p. 176), and the fatal precipitation of the villain down a hotel lift-shaft. Another collaboration with Harris, <span class="italic">Youth</span> (1881), was notable for the authenticity of its rendering of the convict-yard at Portsmouth gaol, which Meritt had previously visited to absorb the atmosphere.<br>
<br>During the early 1880s Meritt partnered George Conquest at the Surrey Theatre, which led to several jointly written plays and equal sharing of the profits. Indeed, most of Meritt's forty-odd pieces were collaborations, if not with Conquest or Harris, then with Tom Taylor, Henry Spry, or Henry Pettitt. As there was also money to be made from novels based on popular plays, Meritt recruited a Surrey colleague, the actor W. Howell Poole, who dabbled a little in fiction, to produce a novelistic version of <span class="italic">The New Babylon</span>. It was published jointly in 1882, but Meritt, having contributed little beyond the basic framework, received only a one-third royalty. He later quarrelled with Poole over &#145;Hidden Millions&#146;, a prose version of his earlier play <span class="italic">Glin Gath</span>, published under Meritt's sole name in <span class="italic">Pictorial World</span> (Christmas 1882). As principal author, Poole claimed a &pound;200 royalty rather than the &pound;45 Meritt actually paid; but after a two-day court hearing in 1885, irreconcilable conflicts in evidence emerged, preventing the jury from agreeing on a verdict. Meritt's last exposure on the London stage was the revival of <span class="italic">The World</span> (1894), which ran for fifty performances. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, it had aged well for a fourteen-year-old play and, as a spectacular, episodic melodrama, was still &#145;a striking work of its class&#146;  (26 Feb 1894).<br>
<br>A large-framed man, well-built, and bespectacled, with a rather chubby appearance, Meritt possessed, in William Archer's opinion, powers of invention which could have fitted him &#145;for better things&#146;  (Archer, 231). But within his range he enjoyed real success and made enough money to indulge his passion of collecting theatrical portraiture. A member of the Savage Club and the Dramatic Authors' Society, he knew the theatre intimately and was a friend of leading figures such as Arthur Pinero and Henry Irving. Actively involved in the production of his plays, he attended the majority of first nights personally. About a quarter of his dramatic output was published, all in Lacy's <span class="italic">Acting Edition</span>. Meritt died on 7 July 1895 at his home, The Hollies, Pembroke Square, Kensington, London, and was buried on the 11th in Brompton cemetery in London. He was survived by his wife, Annie.<br>
