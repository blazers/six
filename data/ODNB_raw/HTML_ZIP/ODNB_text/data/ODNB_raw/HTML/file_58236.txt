<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Benn, Sir  John Williams</span>, first baronet  (1850&#150;1922), <span class="occ">publisher and politician</span>, was born at Hyde, Cheshire, on 13 November 1850, the eldest child of the Revd Julius Benn (1826&#150;1883), Congregational minister, and his wife, Ann Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1890). The family settled in Stepney in the East End of London when Benn was nine and he attended a small private school there before beginning work, at the age of eleven, as an office boy. At seventeen he moved to a wholesale furniture house. He was attending an art school at night, and in 1868 became a junior draughtsman for the firm, and then quickly chief designer. He was made a junior partner in 1873. On 1 July 1874 he married Elizabeth 
    (Lily; <i>d</i>. 1928)
  , the youngest daughter of John Pickstone, of Silver Hill, Hyde. They had two daughters and four sons.<br>
<br>In 1880 Benn resigned his partnership and launched his own furniture design journal, the <span class="italic">Cabinet Maker</span>. Although forming the foundation of what was to become a thriving publishing firm, the journal struggled early on, and to support it Benn, a natural performer, began a successful part-time career providing illustrated lecture entertainments at various clubs and halls.<br>
<br>In 1889, in the first London county council (LCC) election, Benn stood for East Finsbury. In his election address he called for municipal control of gas and water supply, of liquor licences, and of markets; he supported council housing, the abolition of the privileges of the city corporation, and a fairer local taxation system. He assured his electorate that &#145;if elected, I shall be found among the party of progress&#146;  (East Finchley election address, 1889, National Liberal Club Collection, Bristol University Library). He was easily elected, and remained on the council until his death. Benn has been described as a &#145;classic radical&#146;  (Thane, 246). By 1893 Beatrice Webb could identify him as one of the inner group of Progressives &#145;who direct the parliamentary and political policy of the County Council&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Beatrice Webb, 2: 1892&#150;1905</span>, ed. N. Mackenzie and J. Mackenzie, 1983, 34). His major target was &eacute;litism and corruption in local government, particularly within the City of London. He fought for the reform and public ownership of London's tramways and other utilities through much of his long period of LCC membership. He concerned himself above all with the tramways, successfully advocating the electrification of the system, and less successfully the large-scale construction of subways at busy junctions (the underpass which carries road traffic from Waterloo Bridge to Kingsway survives as a memorial to Benn's ambitions).<br>
<br>Benn was adopted as the Liberal parliamentary candidate for the St George-in-the-East and Wapping constituency at the 1892 general election. He campaigned for social reform, often recalling the work of his father as a missionary in the area. He said that he aspired &#145;to the honour of being the member for the back streets&#146;  (Higgins, 27), and was elected with a comfortable majority but lost the seat in the 1895 election by just four votes. The 1895 campaign became extremely bitter, after personal attacks were made on Benn and, as &#145;restraint and calculation were never strong points in his vivacious character&#146;  (Gardiner, 190), he responded in kind. In counter-suits of electoral malpractice following the election, he lost, and was banned from being a candidate in St George's for seven years. He stood unsuccessfully for Deptford in 1897 and Bermondsey in 1900. At a by-election in 1904 he won the seat of Devonport, which he held until January 1910. That December he unsuccessfully contested Clapham.<br>
<br>Benn was chairman of the LCC in 1904&#150;5 and leader of the Progressives on the council from 1907 to 1918. In his last years, as the only remaining original member, Benn was widely known as the &#145;Father&#146; of the council  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 April 1922). He was knighted in 1906 and made a baronet in 1914. Benn was tall and distinguished in his looks and was said to have a &#145;breathless interest in life&#146;  (Gardiner, 473). He was a man of great passion and enormous vitality, often extremely impulsive. He died on 10 April 1922 at his home, Stone Wall, Limpsfield, Surrey. He was buried at Limpsfield church on 13 April. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30704/', "Ernest John Pickstone Benn (1875&#150;1954)")</script>, politician, succeeded to the baronetcy. Another of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30705/', "William Wedgwood Benn (1877&#150;1960)")</script>, was created Viscount Stansgate and was the father of Anthony Wedgwood Benn (<i>b</i>. 1925), politician.<br>
