<span class="headword">Collier,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">Baptist preacher</span>, may have been the yeoman farmer of that name from Witney, in Surrey, prosecuted in 1634 for withholding tithes. Nothing is certainly known of his birth or early life.<h2>
<a name="Amastersectary"></a>&#145;A master sectary&#146;</h2>Collier was reported to have acted as a teacher of a church at York, whose origins are obscure, though elements of the earl of Manchester's army, arriving before the city in June 1644 at the onset of the famous siege, were already said to have been infected by &#145;either Anabaptisme or Antinomianisme, or both&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.185). During that winter, or perhaps the next, several were rebaptized by immersion in the River Ouse, and when the future Quakers William and Anne Dewsberry were married at York, probably in 1646, Anne was already a member of a Baptist congregation there. This church may very well have been that taught by Collier.<br>
<br>But Collier had left before then and was far from York, active as a travelling lay preacher. Though proof is lacking, the pattern of Collier's itinerary is consistent with attachment to the army. He was in correspondence with John Sims, arrested in May 1646 at Middlezoy, a village near Taunton where the army had camped after the battle of Langport on 10 July 1645. And he was reported to have been expelled from Guernsey for &#145;turbulent behaviour&#146;, possibly among the troops besieging Castle Cornet. Released from prison in Portsmouth, he toured through Dorset, Hampshire, and Sussex, and, having preached at Guildford at the end of May 1646, made his way to London. Letters passed between him, local adherents, and other evangelists. To Thomas Edwards he appeared as &#145;a master sectarie, a man of great power among them, and hath Emissaries under him, whom he sends abroad&#146;  (Edwards, 3.41). At least at Taunton, Collier seems to have been able to found, or at least help sustain, a functioning organization, though it is not known how long this or other possible fruits of his early evangelism survived. But as orthodox ministers grimly surveyed the trail of theological destruction in the wake of the preacher&#151;&#145;the first that sowed the seeds of Anabaptism, Anti-sabbatarianism and some Arminianism &hellip; in these parts&#146;&#151;they were forced to concede that &#145;doubtless it was strong poison he gave them that wrought so strongly at first&#146;  (ibid., 3.29).<br>
<br>The hostility of the presbyterians was wholly reciprocated. In <span class="italic">Certaine Queries, or, Points now in Controvercy</span>, which George Thomason picked up on 24 July 1645, Collier called upon parliament to &#145;dismiss that assembly of learned men who are now called together for to consult about matters of religion&#146;, since he knew &#145;no rule in the Book of God for such an assembly&#146;  (Collier, <span class="italic">Certaine Queries</span>, 27). Also during 1645, in his <span class="italic">Three Great Quaeries</span>, Collier took issue with the Arminianism later attributed to him. In terms of predestination, he opposed the Arminians, while defending a heavily qualified doctrine of general redemption. In most points, he remained a high-Calvinist, but one whose theology of free grace tended, in the early years, to undermine the role in salvation of obedience to the law. This strongly spiritualistic and antinomian tendency was widespread among the radical army chaplains, and it alarmed the orthodox at least as much as did Arminianism itself. Men such as Robert Baillie felt justified in lumping the two together because of the licence they seemed to offer to saints who jibbed at church discipline. In works of the later 1640s, indeed, Collier stressed the spiritual aspects of religion to the point of denying significance to formal ordinances. Later, he acknowledged having held these views, now seen as errors, in order to repudiate them decisively.<h2>
<a name="Politicalpreacher"></a>Political preacher</h2>The earliest definite evidence of Collier's formal employment in the army is the payment to him of &pound;31 13<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. in May 1650, for duties undertaken not earlier than August 1647, as chaplain to Colonel Twistleton's New Model regiment of horse. In the autumn of 1647 he was accustomed to speak with &#145;both opportunity and freeness&#146; at the army headquarters at Putney, and there delivered, on 29 September, the sermon later published as <span class="italic">A Discovery of the New Creation</span>. This address incorporated much of the Leveller programme, and breathed reforming zeal and millenarian expectancy. Christ's kingdom would soon be established: &#145;nations shall become the nations of Christ and the government shall be in the hands of the saints&#146;; &#145;tyrannical and oppressing laws and courts of justice&#146; and other grievances would be taken away  (Collier, <span class="italic">Discovery</span>, 32, 35). At the Whitehall debates in December 1648, he opposed Ireton's defence of magistratical powers to punish in religious matters, because this was to claim for the state &#145;power from God, and not from the Agreement of the people&#146;  (Firth, 2.125). Collier, however, did not join the Levellers in protesting against the political solution imposed by the army generals in the winter of 1648&#150;9. He issued a pamphlet which defended the execution of the king and attacked the corruption and betrayals of parliament, but urged that in settling a peace, &#145;those who are saved spiritually know best what is good for the nations temporal well being&#146;  (Collier, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 6). The army generals were identified and defended as having set about the necessary task of destroying enemies whom readers would have understood to include the Levellers.<br>
<br>In the early 1650s, Collier was active in Somerset and also seems to have retained some relation with the army. Accounts of a sermon at Axbridge in 1651 reported him to be living at Westbury. At a dispute at Wiveliscombe on 4 May 1652, he appeared, according to a hostile witness, &#145;guarded as it were with some soldiers, and a great company of his furious disciples&#146;, engaging an army captain as a moderator in the debate  (Fullwood, sig. C2<i>r</i>). Collier continued to demand a radical separation between the spheres of religion and the state. In 1652 he asked rhetorically of the commissioners for the propagation of the gospel &#145;whether a State-maintenance for the Ministery of Christ, be agreeable to any Rule in the Gospel?&#146;  (Collier, <span class="italic">Font-Guard</span>, sig. P1<i>v</i>).<h2>
<a name="Westcountryleader"></a>West country leader</h2>But there was also pressure upon Collier and other Baptist leaders to deal with disorderly practices in their churches and with the influence upon them of seeking, ranting, and now quaking, which tended towards the subversion of external authorities, of church, and scripture. Baptist associations were founded partly in order to help establish and police &#145;orderly walking&#146; in the face of these challenges. Collier helped build one such organization, aligned with the Particular Baptist churches of London, in the west country. He reported to the several churches from its first general meeting at Wells on 8&#150;9 November 1653, and from many subsequent gatherings. This body was welcomed by the Baptists it sought to organize. But the proposal to ordain Collier as a &#145;messenger&#146; empowered to spread the word outside the already constituted congregations of the association aroused dissension, and even after the ceremony, at Bridgwater in May 1654, a minority remained unhappy. Ordination merely legitimated Collier's existing practice, and he acquired through it no new powers or any titles, such as general superintendent. But the absence for many years of any such formal qualification may indicate the attachment of local Baptists to informal practices favouring lay initiative. The new concern for order was reflected in other ways. Collier attacked the Quakers as Levellers, writing angrily against those who undermined the gospel &#145;under pretence of holiness and light within&#146; and &#145;their pernicious ways in stirring up to despise dominion and to speak evil of dignities and government&#146;  (White, <span class="italic">Association Records of Particular Baptists</span>, 90).<br>
<br>Yet Collier did not play the unambiguously restraining role of men such as William Kiffin: more than other Calvinistic leaders, he continued to stress the active role of ordinary church members, and especially the development of their gifts in prophesying. This originated in the mid-1640s, and drew from the millenarian mood among the saints of the new model, which Collier had both shared and helped to strengthen. Dampened for a time, perhaps, by the more prosaic routines of rural life, his hopes were never quite extinguished. In 1652 he asked &#145;Whether it be not the duty of the Magistrate to permit the <i>Jews</i>, whose Conversion is promised, and we pretend to expect it, to live peaceably amongst us?&#146;  (Collier, <span class="italic">Font-Guard</span>, sig. P2<i>r</i>). During the rule of the first Rump Parliament and the early protectorate, the saints experienced as a double affront to their great expectations the fortune hunters who clustered round the centres of power. Febrile high politics helped rekindle the flames of millennial anticipation, both in organized circles of the Fifth Monarchists and among others, such as Thomas Collier, who did not adopt that name.<br>
<br>Collier and they, however, confronted a widening gap between the prospect of Christ's imminent rule on earth and the apathy of so many, even among the churches, to the message of its prophets. And thus, letters signed by Collier, Captain Nathaniel Strange, and others strained to urge upon the congregated saints of the western counties the need for fervent prayer, so that God would<blockquote>guide those who wait for Zion's redemption &hellip; searching after and hastening unto the fulfilling of all the glorious promises and prophesies which relate to the downfall of all that rise up against the work of Christ in both themselves and in the earth. (White, <span class="italic">Association Records of Particular Baptists</span>, 81)</blockquote>It may not be thought surprising that some interpreted such injunctions as a call to arms. In 1658 at Dorchester, a meeting was held between Baptist representatives (millenarian and moderate) and others who expected, and hoped to hasten by military force, the coming of the fifth monarchy. Government spies reported the presence of Kiffin, who sought to restrain the participants from uniting in violent activism. Thomas Collier presided over at least one of the sessions. His political role is not certainly known, but his opposition in 1657 to the open insurrectionism of Tillinghast may suggest that he sided with the moderates.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>After the Restoration, Collier continued his activities in the Baptist cause in at least two counties. He was reported to be teaching at Axbridge, Somerset, in 1669, and was licensed there in 1672 as a Baptist preacher, at the house of Edward Woollcot, an associate in the town in 1651. In 1672 he was also licensed as a teacher at North Bradley, Wiltshire, where there was soon a clash with the London leaders. Collier's dogmatics continued to arouse their hostility. During the 1650s he had moved towards a more orthodox Calvinism, though his &#145;Somerset confession&#146; still differed in points of detail from that issued in 1646 by the seven London Particular Baptist churches and expounded by Benjamin Cox. Thirty years later Collier published a synopsis of his views on election, general redemption, and Christology, which ranged him against Cox's son Nehemiah. Finding Collier's views heterodox, the London leaders persuaded the young Cox to write a refutation, <span class="italic">Vindiciae veritatis</span> (1677), and in October 1676 themselves descended on North Bradley &#145;to settle some disorder&#146; arising from his &#145;unsound doctrine or new notions&#146;  (Hayden, 185).<br>
<br>But in response to all this, and to a new and very orthodox Calvinist second London confession of faith (1677), the unrepentant Collier published his own, appending to it a critique of the official version, which was endorsed by the Western Association in 1691: it seems his personal prestige in Somerset was undiminished by the Londoners' campaign. Certainly his antipathy to official positions deepened. Collier's last work, <span class="italic">A Doctrinal Discourse of Self Denial</span> (1691), attacked those who &#145;teach the people, a justifying, saving faith without works&#146;  (Collier, <span class="italic">Doctrinal Discourse</span>, 70&#150;71). In its strict demands upon the saints, the book stood opposed to the incipient libertarianism of its author's youth. But these were sides of a single coin: his continuing rejection of outright determinism as a source of self-satisfaction and falsity in faith. And thus, in a reignited radicalism of almost half a century's vintage, Collier raged against the ethos of Williamite England:<blockquote>self it is that rules, in city and country, self profit and advantage it is, that manageth all callings &hellip; self honour, self pride and self will it is that is the cause of most of the wars and blood in the world;</blockquote>and this spirit ruled &#145;not only in the profane but in professors too&#146;  (ibid., 36). Thomas Collier died before the publication of his last book. John Collier, who was perhaps a relation, informs us in his preface that the author delivered his manuscript &#145;but a day or two before he died&#146;.<br>
