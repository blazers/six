<span class="headword">Carver <span class="st"> [Carvor]</span>,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Robert Arnot]</span>  (<em>b. </em>1487/8, <em>d.</em> in or after 1568), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born between 25 March 1487 and 24 March 1488, possibly in Aberdeen. He is of uncertain parentage and upbringing, but a maternal uncle, Andrew Gray, was a chantry chaplain of St Nicholas's Church, Aberdeen; Andrew's parents, Robert and Ellen Gray, were thus the composer's maternal grandparents, and he may have been the son of a Robert Carver and Marjorie Gray of Aberdeen. Ample opportunity for a musical education was available in this city, through a choristership at the cathedral church, the chapel of St Mary's College, or the parish church of St Nicholas.<br>
<br>At about the age of fourteen Carver entered the noviciate at the Augustinian abbey of Scone, and he took his vows as a canon of the house in his sixteenth year. The key to understanding the next stage of his career is provided by the manner in which he chose to use in musical contexts the pseudonym Arnot. It appears that he took this name in recognition of patronage conferred by David Arnot, a trusted servant of James IV, who for some years after 1501 acted with the abbot of Scone to endow and found the royal collegiate church (sometimes called Chapel Royal) of St Mary and St Michael located within Stirling Castle. Established by 1503 for a dean and six dignitaries, and for ten other canons, ten minor canons, and six boy choristers all to be skilled in music and to form the choir, this immediately became the foremost institution in Scotland for the performance of divine service enhanced with elaborate polyphonic music. In 1508 Arnot was appointed its dean, and it seems likely that his particular service to Carver consisted of his persuading his colleague the abbot of Scone (an institution offering the composer no local scope for the exercise of his talents) to permit the young musician to accept appointment as a member of the Stirling choir. No documentation yet discovered fully substantiates this hypothesis; nevertheless, perhaps no choir in the kingdom other than that at Stirling could have tackled the monumental demands made by some of Carver's music, and such an act of patronage amply explains Carver's adopting the name of Arnot in gratitude.<br>
<br>Probably the composer is to be identified with the Robert Arnat who on 15 July 1543 was collated to a full canonry and prebend of the Stirling chapel; it seems likely that this promotion was conferred as due recognition for some thirty-five years' work at the college, and also as a sinecure source of income serving as a pension in his retirement. He returned to Scone Abbey, where he was at perfect liberty to continue composing and where his signature occurs frequently on a series of documents beginning in 1544. The community persisted even after the destruction of the abbey buildings in 1559, and Carver may well have remained in a form of religious life until his decease.<br>
<br>A single manuscript apparently originating at the Stirling royal chapel now serves as the sole surviving repository of Carver's attributed works, which extend to five masses (two dated) and two votive antiphons. The mass <span class="italic">Dum sacrum mysterium</span> (1508&#150;13), for ten voices, was conceived on a gigantic scale; its cantus firmus honours St Michael, and probably it was begun when Carver (putatively) joined the Stirling chapel, dedicated to this saint, in 1508. Later works include the only extant mass composed by a Briton on the continental cantus firmus <span class="italic">L'homme arm&eacute;</span>, a votive antiphon, <span class="italic">O bone Jesu</span>, for the remarkable number of nineteen voices, masses for six and five voices, and finally&#151;dated 1546&#151;a mass, <span class="italic">Pater creator omnium</span>. Between the earliest and latest works Carver travelled from a somewhat overblown engagement of the English late fifteenth-century style of ornamental, rhapsodic, and non-imitative polyphony to more concentrated forms of contrapuntal writing, admitting imitation and other points of structural integration, and examples of chordal orientation. He was capable of creating passages of considerable sonic beauty, and his vocal lines are never less than finely spun. His early achievement was commonly beset by a tendency to overwrite and by a somewhat stunted sense of harmonic structure and progression capable of generating rather graceless periods of static monotony. His finest compositions, especially the five-voice mass, overcame these debilities to yield work of high accomplishment. Advanced in years, Carver is presumed to have died soon after his latest documented appearance in 1568.<br>
