<span class="headword">John fitz Geoffrey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1206&#150;1258), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland and baronial leader</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9626/', "Geoffrey fitz Peter, fourth earl of Essex")</script>, justiciar of England (<i>d</i>. 1213), and his second wife, Aveline, daughter of Roger de Clare, earl of Hertford, and widow of William de Munchensi. In 1227 John fitz Geoffrey gave the king 300 marks to have seisin of the lands that had descended to him by right of inheritance from his father. Geoffrey fitz Peter had intended these to be extensive, for King John had granted to him and his heirs from his marriage with Aveline the castle and honour of Berkhamsted. This grant, however, never came to fruition, and Berkhamsted, after Geoffrey's death, remained in the hands of the king. Thus, with the earldom of Essex passing to the descendants of Geoffrey's first marriage, John had to make do with such manors as Aylesbury and Steeple Claydon in Buckinghamshire, Exning in Suffolk, and Cherhill and Winterslow in Wiltshire, the last the only part of the honour of Berkhamsted that he obtained. John was a substantial magnate but, in terms of land held in hereditary right, not one of the first rank. Probably this situation, and the example of his father, who had risen in the king's service from humble origins to the earldom of Essex, was the spur to his long career in the royal administration.<br>
<br>John began that career as sheriff of Yorkshire between 1234 and 1236. Then, in 1237, at the request of a parliament that conceded the king taxation, he was added to the king's council along with William (IV) de Warenne, earl of Surrey, and William de Ferrers, earl of Derby. If this elevation to the highest level reflected John's standing with his fellow magnates, in the ensuing years he gained and retained the confidence of the king. From 1237 until 1245 he seems to have acted as one of the stewards of the king's household, a post that he combined with the sheriffdom of Gloucestershire (1238&#150;46) and more briefly with the office of chief justice of the southern forests (1241&#150;2) and the seneschalship of Gascony (1243). He was thus well fitted for his long period in office as justiciar of Ireland (1245&#150;56), where he had private interests through the dower of his wife, Isabel (daughter of Hugh Bigod, earl of Norfolk), who was the widow of Gilbert de Lacy of co. Meath. In 1254 Ireland was made part of the endowment of Edward, the king's son, and John fitz Geoffrey, between 1254 and 1258, became the prince's leading councillor. He also retained his place on the council of the king. His rewards from the latter, over his long career, had included the manors of Whaddon, Buckinghamshire, and Ringwood, Hampshire, the wardship of the land and heirs of Theobald Butler in Ireland (for which he paid 3000 marks), and &#145;for his immense and laudable service&#146; the whole cantred of the Isles in Thomond.<br>
<br>In the political crisis of 1258, however, John fitz Geoffrey was one of the king's chief opponents. Indeed, a later chronicle, the Westminster <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span>, named him and Simon de Montfort as the ringleaders of the revolution. Certainly he was one of the seven magnates whose confederation in April 1258 began the process of reform. He was then one of the twelve chosen by the barons to reform the realm, and one of the council of fifteen imposed on the king by the provisions of Oxford. On 23 July 1258 he went with Roger (III) Bigod, earl of Norfolk, and Simon de Montfort to demand that the Londoners accept &#145;whatever the barons should provide for the utility and foundation of the realm&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cronica maiorum et vicecomitum Londiniarum</span>, 38&#150;9). John's sudden death on 23 November 1258 thus deprived the new regime of one of its bastions. The Westminster <span class="italic">Flores</span> ascribed John's conduct to resentment at being removed from the justiciarship of Ireland. Like other leading magnates he was also provoked by the behaviour of the king's Poitevin half-brothers. His place in Edward's councils was threatened by their growing influence over the prince. In addition, he was engaged in a fierce dispute over the advowson of one of his manors&#151;Shere in Surrey&#151;with the youngest of the brothers, Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke and bishop-elect of Winchester. This reached a climax on 1 April 1258 when Valence's men attacked John's at Shere and killed one of them. When John demanded justice, the king refused to hear him. This episode helped spur the revolutionary action taken against the king at the Westminster parliament which opened a week later. Indignation at John's treatment spread the more easily because his brothers-in-law were Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk, and Hugh Bigod, who was later appointed justiciar by the provisions of Oxford. Both were his colleagues among the seven original confederate magnates.<br>
<br>John fitz Geoffrey was evidently a man of considerable parts, respected both by his fellow magnates and by the king. Indeed, despite his role in the revolution of 1258, when Henry III heard of John's death he ordered a solemn mass to be celebrated for his soul and donated a cloth of gold to cover his coffin. John was succeeded by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38272/', "John fitz John")</script>, who became a leading supporter of Simon de Montfort.<br>
