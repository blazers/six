<span class="headword">Moir,  James</span>  (1806&#150;1880), <span class="occ">tea merchant, Chartist, and local politician</span>, was born in Stenhousemuir, Stirlingshire, on 18 May 1806, the son of Benjamin Moir, an ironfounder, and Janet Burgess. Nothing is known of his schooling, but he went to work with James Wallace, a tea merchant in the Gallowgate of Glasgow. Early in the 1820s he opened his own retail and wholesale tea business at 179 Gallowgate, a business that he retained until shortly before his death. He may have been part of his father's second family since he had at least one brother, or more probably half-brother, Benjamin, born in 1781 or 1783, and a younger sister, Janet, who was not born until 1815. Benjamin, a labourer, was one of those sentenced to death for high treason for his part in the radical uprising which ended at Bonnymuir in April 1820. The sentence was commuted to transportation for life and he was still in Australia in 1849. Intriguingly, judging from two letters from Benjamin in James Moir's few remaining papers, in all these years James never wrote to Benjamin.<br>
<br>James Moir became active in the Glasgow Political Union during the parliamentary reform agitation of 1831&#150;2. He also campaigned for local government reform, and in 1835 made his first unsuccessful bid for membership of the Glasgow town council. He was one of the founders of the movement for the <span class="roman">People's Charter</span> in Glasgow at the end of 1837. In the debates within the Universal Suffrage Association he held out strongly for the focus being exclusively on the six points and resisted efforts to link it to the campaign for repeal of the corn laws. At the end of 1838 Moir's name went forward as a Chartist candidate for the town council, but he withdrew before the poll. In a hostile press he was lampooned as &#145;wild Rory O'More&#146;. He was the Glasgow delegate to the Chartist convention in 1839 and, although his contribution to debates seems to have been quite slight, he was a useful chairman and helped canvass signatures for the Chartist petition with a tour of Devon. Moir never ruled out the possibility of the use of physical force should the petition be rejected, but he argued that any actions had to be co-ordinated across the country.<br>
<br>After the break-up of the convention Scottish Chartists established their own universal suffrage central committee of which Moir became chairman. In the debates within Chartism he generally remained loyal to Feargus O'Connor, rejecting William Lovett's so-called &#145;new move&#146; in 1841 as &#145;a new utopian humbug&#146;, and he kept clear of the Complete Suffrage Association with its call for a union between the middle and working classes. Chartist churches were an important part of the movement in Scotland, but Moir does not seem to have participated in them, and he parted company with those of his colleagues who were most active in the churches. He also differed from O'Connor on the issue of getting involved in local government politics. In 1843 he stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Glasgow police commission, but was elected in the following year. On 2 February 1846 he married Martha Roxburgh McGavin (1808&#150;1876), daughter of Robert McGavin, a mildly radical councillor, and later that year he stood, again unsuccessfully, for the town council. He did, however, achieve success in 1848 when, in the second ward, he defeated the lord provost and MP Alexander Hastie, claiming to represent the city's east end against the expanding middle-class suburbs in the west. He continued these struggles in the 1860s with a campaign to ensure that the city's west end park was open to all as a public right of way.<br>
<br>On Glasgow's town council Moir concerned himself particularly with police and sanitary matters (he brought about the introduction of public urinals to the city in the 1860s), but he retained his interest in wider political issues, supporting the north in the American Civil War and espousing the cause of the Peace Society. He was influential in Liberal Party circles and became president of the Scottish National Reform League in 1867, campaigning for a further extension of the franchise. He pulled out of the town council election of 1865 when it was clear that he was likely to be defeated, but was returned in 1868, after a campaign to prevent encroachments on Glasgow Green. In 1871 he was elected unopposed for the fourth ward and raised to the magistrates' bench as a bailie. He was now very comfortably off, some of the radicalism had mellowed, and he was caricatured as &#145;Rory O'Bore&#146; who had &#145;flourished, waxed fat, laughed and grew rich&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Bailie</span>, 4, 13 Nov 1872). A slight pomposity had entered the tone of his speeches and much was made of his &#145;dignity and decorum&#146;. In 1874, having opposed demands for a &#145;permissive bill&#146; to enable local areas to prohibit the sale of alcohol, he was defeated by a temperance advocate. In 1875, however, he was returned unopposed for the tenth ward and he retained that seat until his death.<br>
<br>Moir and his wife had had three children, but they all died in infancy and his wife predeceased him in April 1876. In his later years he lived with his sister, Janet, at 1 Broomhill Avenue in Partick. He bequeathed his extensive collection of books and pamphlets to the city's Mitchell Library together with the residue of his estate. The library received an endowment of &pound;11,460 and he is commemorated in the city's Moir Hall. He died at 1 Broomhill Avenue of the effects of an abscess on 1 December 1880 and was buried in Sighthill cemetery, Glasgow.<br>
