<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Austin,  Robert Sargent</span>  (1895&#150;1973), <span class="occ">engraver and watercolour painter</span>, was born on 23 June 1895 at 14 Magazine Square, Leicester, the eldest of the three children of Robert Austin, a cabinet-maker, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. Encouraged by his father, after leaving Lansdowne Road school he attended Leicester Municipal School of Art. From there in 1914 he went to the Royal College of Art, but his studies were interrupted by war service. He returned to the college in 1919, under Sir Frank Short, and won the Rome scholarship for engraving in 1922. For three years he lived in Italy, where he met the writer Ada May Harrison (<i>d</i>. 1958). They were married in 1924 and collaborated on various illustrated books. They had three children: Robert (<i>b</i>. 1927), Clare (<i>b</i>. 1929), and Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1931). After settling in Chiswick, Middlesex, Austin held his first exhibition of prints and took up a teaching post at the Royal College of Art, where his principled approach was an influence on many. He became professor of engraving in 1946. Austin was a quiet, good-looking man. When attending the Royal College he wore a semi-stiff white collar, a silk tie (always Italian), and a trilby hat, its angle carefully adjusted. His personal reserve was balanced by a marvellous sense of humour. When he retired in 1955 the college had changed, and his perfect technique and remarkable draughtsmanship had become unfashionable. In the 1960s he was president of the Royal Watercolour Society and the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, where his influence continued.<br>
<br>The state of the art market needs to be borne in mind when assessing Austin's work, which until 1930 consisted mainly of prints; in the 1920s print-making was popular and it made sense to specialize. In 1927 his drawings sold for between 10 and 20 guineas and his engravings for 3 to 8 guineas each. Following the collapse of the print market in 1929 he made fewer engravings, and after 1940 his important works were drawings and watercolours, which he exhibited annually at the Royal Academy or the Royal Watercolour Society. With the exception of those in the Imperial War Museum, London, Austin's drawings are less well known than the engravings, which museums collected more consistently. Many landscapes resulted from visits to Norfolk, where he had a holiday cottage. He also produced flower and figure pieces and strong, perceptive portraits in chalks, for example that of F. R. Leavis (National Portrait Gallery, London).<br>
<br>The inflated 1920s print market favoured the spontaneous and mobile line of etching, but Austin soon developed an austere, linear style that called for the clear incised line of the engraver's burin, a tool demanding exceptional skill. He made his reputation with figure and animal subjects in the manner of the early masters of engraving, for example, the monumental <span class="italic">Puppet Master</span> (1926). He styled his monogram, &#145;R.S.A&#146;, on that of the early German engraver Schongauer. Other influences include the Pre-Raphaelites (his <span class="italic">Summer Night</span>, 1935, was inspired by a Millais illustration to Tennyson), and his strong design sense is partly a response to the cropped compositions of William Nicholson's woodcuts. The engravings of the 1930s are the finest of all his works, their subjects isolated on the plate and fixed in space by a perfection of design. <span class="italic">Mask</span> (1933) is a restrained and telling self-portrait, juxtaposing the life mask of Austin made by the sculptor James Woodford with a sprig of laurel, and recalling his days in Rome. Austin died on 18 September 1973 in Burnham Overy, Staithe, Norfolk, and was buried in Chiswick churchyard.<br>
