<span class="headword">Elliott,  George Henry</span>  (1882&#150;1962), <span class="occ">black-face minstrel and music-hall entertainer</span>, was born on 3 November 1882 at the George and Dragon inn, Blackwater Street, Rochdale, Lancashire. His publican father, Henry, was locally well known as a pianist, while his mother, Alice (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Gray), was an actress and accomplished contralto vocalist. From the age of three Elliott's childhood was spent in North America, to where his parents emigrated. He first appeared on stage at the age of five as a &#145;child soprano&#146; and from then on continuously secured a number of theatrical parts culminating in the title-role of Frances Hodgson Burnett's <span class="italic">Little Lord Fauntleroy</span>, with which he toured Canada and the northern and southern United States. He continued a touring life with Primrose and West's minstrels, whom he joined at the age of nine as a singer and dancer. It was with this troupe that he consolidated his early stagecraft, as well as first appearing in black-face, and it was with this abundant early training that he returned to England with his family in 1894. He started in the smaller provincial halls favoured by a largely working-class clientele, and for three years in the early 1900s worked with Harry Reynolds's minstrels at such seaside resorts as Rhyl and Colwyn Bay. With Reynolds's troupe, as well as delivering his &#145;coon&#146; speciality, he sang ballads and comic and eccentric songs with equal facility, performed in sketches, burlesques, and acrobatic stunts, and with another member of the troupe worked up a musical double act in which he played several instruments.<br>
<br>Elliott made his London d&eacute;but on 10 March 1902 at Sadler's Wells Theatre, and later that year was engaged at Gatti's, Westminster Bridge Road, earning &pound;4 for the week. Big-time success came quickly after this, with his first West End engagement at the Oxford Music-Hall in October 1903, and it was then that he earned his theatrical nickname, the Chocolate-Coloured Coon. He remained in demand for the rest of his long career, on record and radio as well as on stage, though he was at the height of his powers in the first three decades of the twentieth century. He topped the bill for the first time at the Parthenon Music-Hall in Liverpool. Towards the end of the First World War, and during the subsequent armistice period, he appeared as the star of a concert party organized by the RAF. With his infectious gaiety and ability to win over an audience, regardless of the size of venue, he made a considerable impression on those he entertained. After the death of Eugene Stratton in 1918, Elliott assumed Stratton's sentimental &#145;coon singer&#146; mantle and revived many of the Leslie Stuart songs that Stratton had popularized (including &#145;Lily of Laguna&#146; and &#145;Little Dolly Daydream&#146;), though he always meticulously acknowledged Stratton as their original singer and offered them as his personal tribute to the Dandy Coloured Coon (Stratton's own sobriquet). He did not possess the same authority of stage presence as Stratton, who was said to be able effortlessly to fill the stage with a sudden pose, and his rendition of Stratton's songs was not quite as assured, especially in his later years. None the less, Elliott was a memorable performer in his own right, having a light, tenor voice of &#145;flute-like clarity&#146;  (Midwinter, 105). His intense mode of singing was full of heartfelt conviction. Harry Reynolds's evaluation of him as Britain's &#145;leading coon exponent&#146; and &#145;always a fine and conscientious artiste&#146;  (Reynolds, 238), rarely disappointing his public, is echoed in many reviews and memoirs. He assimilated ragtime material into his minstrelized routine, and also built up his own repertoire of material, written by divers hands. This included such favourites as &#145;I want to go to Idaho&#146;, &#145;Hello, Susie Green&#146;, &#145;The Honeysuckle and the Bee&#146;, &#145;If the man in the moon were a coon&#146;, &#145;Sue, Sue, Sue&#146;, &#145;I've had my fortune told&#146;, &#145;In Arizona&#146;, &#145;My Southern Maid&#146;, &#145;I'se a-waitin' for yer, Josie&#146;, and &#145;Rastus Brown&#146;. He was known most of all for &#145;I used to sigh for the silv'ry moon&#146;, which he first performed at the Hackney Empire in 1908&#151;he named his home in Saltdean, Sussex, Silvery Moon in tribute to its success. Elliott had a distinctive stage persona, always being a dapper, even snappy, dresser, appearing with aplomb in white linen suit and trilby to offset his minstrel make-up, and was adept at soft-shoe dancing, using this part of his act as a form of break between verses, or a way of suavely rounding off vocal performances. He appeared twice before royalty, first at the Alhambra in a royal variety performance on 12 February 1925 and second on 1 November 1948, when in a command performance at the London Palladium he combined with six other old music-hall performers in Don Ross's show, <span class="italic">Thanks for the Memory</span>, which had earlier enjoyed a very successful national tour.<br>
<br>Elliott married twice, first to Emily Hayes, singer, and then, on 28 July 1943, to Florence May Street, herself a variety artist. He had one son, Anthony. Elliott continued to give occasional performances throughout the early 1950s, coming on stage with his second wife, whom he addressed minstrel-style as his Lindy Lou. He made his farewell tour of the remaining halls in 1955. Elliott's act was developed in the long tail-end of the black-face tradition, and by the end of his life his whole m&eacute;tier had become rather archaic, not to say racially offensive; yet at the peak of his career he achieved as much success as Gracie Fields and Norman Evans, both also born in Rochdale, and was regarded by many as a consummate practitioner of the early twentieth-century variety stage. He died of a heart attack in a Hove nursing home at 14 New Church Road on 19 November 1962, shortly after his eightieth birthday.<br>
