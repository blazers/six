<span class="headword">Dickenson,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1717, <em>d.</em> 1751), <span class="occ">grocer</span>, was baptized in the parish of St Mary's, Stafford, in November 1717, the younger of two sons of Thomas and Elizabeth Dickenson. Little is known of his early life, but in May 1741 Dickenson became a freeman of Worcester having been apprenticed to grocer Timothy Edwards, probably for the usual seven years. In the March of that year he was elected to the annual office of overseer of the poor for the parish of St Nicholas, where he was churchwarden in 1743 and 1744, attending parish meetings there until 1751.<br>
<br>On 9 August 1748 Dickenson married Jane Bearcroft of Evesham, who had been left &pound;600 by her father, with &pound;200 to come after her mother's death. According to a certificate signed in 1764, the Dickensons' daughter Frances was christened on 5 March 1750; strangely, despite the rector's claim that it was a &#145;true copy of the Register Book of the Parish of St Nicholas&#146;  (Worcester Borough RO, Bearcroft deeds 3964/25), there is no corresponding entry in the actual book.<br>
<br>Dickenson left detailed records of his Foregate Street shop: the bought ledger, 1744&#150;51, contains names and addresses of his suppliers; his account book, 1740&#150;49, shows method and dates of payment; while in his daybooks for the years 1740&#150;51 Dickenson recorded 252 named customers. Approximately half the customer entries include their occupation, address, method of payment, and details of their purchases. Some, perhaps as many as 18 per cent, were themselves retailers. Just over half his customers came from Worcester, but he also supplied people from Droitwich, Evesham, and Bromyard, and as far afield as Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton, Stafford, and Bridgnorth.<br>
<br>Dickenson had a good number of middle-class customers, among whom were apothecaries, clergy, and attorneys. There were also skilled craftspeople, including several who would rank quite high within the hierarchy of working people, such as a tailor and a mantua maker. Their systems of payment varied considerably: cash, credit, bills or notes for other goods or services, or a combination of these methods. Some, such as a gardener, paid for goods by &#145;work done&#146;, others paid in kind; the carpenter settled his account with a pig!<br>
<br>Dickenson mainly obtained his basic supplies from thirty-three Bristol firms, including sugar imported from the colonies, soap, and flour. More sophisticated produce came from twenty-one London companies: candied fruit and ginger, tea, Turkey coffee, &#145;pistache nutts&#146;, Durham mustard. Gloucester supplied snuff and twine; starch, hardware, and hops came from Worcester, clay pipes from Broseley, and anchovies from Chester. Many of his suppliers were on or near the transport system of the River Severn or its coastal links; goods from London combined River Thames shipping with road haulage. Best-selling items were tea, followed closely by sugar and sugar products. Dickenson stocked such ready-made goods as several varieties of biscuit, including &#145;Savoy biscakes&#146;, and a range of confectionery&#151;orange chips, round drops, barley sugar, and Bristol chocolates. He also sold alcohol, some hardwares, and tobacco. His wares clearly define him as a grocer in the mid-eighteenth-century interpretation of that term; unlike the mercers, he had little in the way of cloth, clothes, haberdashery, or apothecary wares.<br>
<br>The account books Dickenson kept are of special interest, being those of a young man just setting up in the retail trade. They illustrate the eighteenth-century system of delayed payment of bills by both customer and retailer; Dickenson generally paid his smaller suppliers within four weeks, but larger companies had to wait for several months. He allowed customer discounts for cash and short-term credit, yet his daybooks indicate an income of only two or three sales per day and the expected extended credit must have made considerable demands on the finances of a new shopkeeper.<br>
<br>Dickenson was buried in Worcester on 23 August 1751; his wife had died twelve days earlier. Although Dickenson was probably not regarded as an influential man by his contemporaries, his up-to-date selection of goods and the range of his suppliers were doubtless important in helping to promote in Worcester and its environs the rapid expansion of wares in the mid-1700s. Dickenson's records are helpful in illuminating an area which suffers from a paucity of documentary evidence&#151;that of the eighteenth-century county-town retailer, his wares, and his customers.<br>
