<span class="headword">David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1137<span class="mult">x</span>9), <span class="occ">bishop of Bangor</span>, is usually identified with David the Scot, the celebrated scholar who wrote an account of the emperor Henry V's Italian expedition of 1111. If this is right, then David was the scholar described in the anonymous <span class="italic">Kaiserchronik</span> later used by Ekkehard of Aura, according to which David Scotigena had become a master at the cathedral school of W&uuml;rzburg, at the shrine of St Kilian, the Irish apostle of Franconia, some time before 1110. The Irish connections of W&uuml;rzburg remained strong in these years, and Abbot Tritheim of W&uuml;rzburg, writing at the end of the fifteenth century in part on the basis of sources now lost, describes David as a kinsman of the Irish-born Macarius. Much earlier Orderic Vitalis seems explicit in calling him Irish, and at the beginning of the twelfth century, in German sources at least, &#145;Scot&#146; most usually meant Irish too.<br>
<br>In 1110 David came to the attention of Henry V, who foresaw the need for learning as well as arms in his forthcoming expedition into Italy, and made him his chaplain. He joined other scholars with the imperial army in its march on Rome, which ended in 1111 with the dramatic surrender of Pope Paschal II over investitures and Henry's imperial coronation. At the emperor's command David wrote an account of the expedition in three books, composed in a style so easy that it differed little from common speech, adapted to the use of laymen or other less learned readers. The work is lost, but some extracts from the text and the documents it included were used by William of Malmesbury in his <span class="italic">Gesta regum</span>, and it is also said to be a source by the <span class="italic">Kaiserchronik</span>, and, much later, by Johannes Aventinus (working in the years 1519&#150;21). Orderic too seems to have known the work, of which he speaks only generally, though favourably. Malmesbury disapproved sharply of its partisan character, rebuking David for his defence of lay investiture and for his comparison of the emperor's capture of the pope to Jacob's forcible extortion of a blessing from the angel, yet he excused the fault of a good man by his purpose in writing a panegyric, not a history.<br>
<br>Nothing more is heard of David until the beginning of 1120, when Gruffudd ap Cynan, prince of Gwynedd, and &#145;all the clergy and people of Wales&#146; elected one David as bishop of Bangor. Bangor had long been vacant, formally since the Breton Bishop Hervey, installed there with Norman support in 1092, had been translated to the new see of Ely in 1109. In fact, however, Hervey had fled his impoverished and unruly diocese after the murder of his brother and several of his men many years earlier. The Welsh sent their bishop-elect to Archbishop Ralph of Canterbury for consecration; the letter he brought was respectful, though it included a threat to seek a bishop from Ireland, or some other barbarous region, if the archbishop refused to act. Ralph entertained David for a time while he instructed him in some matters of divine learning, before consecrating him bishop at Westminster on 4 April 1120 with the consent of King Henry and the assistance of bishops Roger of Salisbury, Richard of London, and Robert of Lincoln, all leading royal servants, and Urban of Llandaff. The new bishop dutifully professed his obedience to Canterbury. Only the strictly contemporary testimony of William of Malmesbury identifies the new bishop as the scholar of W&uuml;rzburg. The European sources say nothing of David's Welsh bishopric and the other English sources know nothing of his earlier career (and the late derivative annals of Worcester call him a Welshman), but on such a point William's authority cannot be lightly set aside. Although Bangor was a surprising destination for a celebrated scholar, the event is not inexplicable; Prince Gruffudd himself had a Norse Irish mother and had spent much of his youth in Ireland, while the emperor was already moving towards a settlement of his dispute with the papacy. In the world of papal&#150;imperial relations which developed after 1112 so relentless an imperial partisan may have become an embarrassment.<br>
<br>Little is known of David's career as bishop. He appears to have taken up his duties at once, for his consent is asserted for the translation of the body of St Dyfrig and the teeth of St Elgar from Bardsey to the new cathedral at Llandaff on 7 May 1120. After that he can be seen from time to time in England: he was at Lambeth twice in 1121 and at Lambeth and Canterbury in 1125. Later that year the king and Giovanni da Crema, the papal legate, drew up an abortive scheme to settle the primacy dispute between Canterbury and York by ceding the dioceses of Bangor, St Asaph, and Chester to York in exchange for a profession of obedience; David's view of the matter is unknown. In May 1127 he attended Archbishop William of Canterbury's legatine council at Westminster with his brother bishops of St David's and Llandaff, but after that he is not recorded in England again. He is last heard of in Wales with his archdeacon at the deathbed of Prince Gruffudd in 1137. His successor, Maurice (or Meurig), had been elected before 3 December 1139, so David may have died a little earlier. It is striking that Maurice at first refused to swear fealty to King Stephen, on the grounds that his predecessor's archdeacon had forbidden him to do so. Perhaps, particularly after the great Welsh rising of 1136, David too had come to support a greater measure of Welsh independence. However, Tritheim asserts that he became a monk of St James of W&uuml;rzburg (the &#145;Schottenkloster&#146; or Irish monastery) where his kinsman Macarius became first abbot in 1138. If the two Davids are indeed one, and Tritheim rightly understood his source, then David retired to W&uuml;rzburg shortly after the death of his prince and the date of his death is unknown.<br>
<br>Besides his book on Henry V's Italian expedition, the earlier English bibliographers claimed that he wrote some further works, and Tritheim listed a quite different set. None of these survives, and none of the attributions suggested by more recent scholars has been widely accepted. At almost every point David's career is uncertain or disputable, and only his history seems to have enjoyed any substantial renown.<br>
