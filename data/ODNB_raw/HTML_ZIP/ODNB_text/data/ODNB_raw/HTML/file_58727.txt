<span class="headword">Ganguly <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Basu]</span>, Kadambini</span>  (<em>c.</em>1862&#150;1923), <span class="occ">physician and political activist</span>, was born in Bhagalpur, a town in eastern India (now in the state of Bihar) where her father, Brajakishore Basu, was headmaster of a school. He was an active member of the reformist Brahmo Samaj, a religious movement based on the philosophy of the <span class="italic">Upanishads</span> and influenced by Sikhism, Islam, and Unitarianism, which stressed intellectual freedom and women's rights. There is no information on Kadambini's mother or siblings, though her mother's brother, Monomohan Ghose, a barrister, was instrumental in persuading Brajakishore to send Kadambini to the progressive Banga Mahila Vidyalaya, the closest approximation to a girls' boarding-school in Calcutta. Monomohan and other Brahmos, including Dwarakanath Ganguly (1844&#150;1898), who was later to marry Kadambini, were the founders of this unique school and continued to be very active in the running of the institution. In 1878 Dwarakanath had to expend considerable energy and time in getting permission for Kadambini to sit for the entrance examination to the University of Calcutta, after she had passed a preliminary test. As there were no girls' colleges at that time the Bethune School in Calcutta added special classes in 1879, and in 1882 Kadambini and Chandramukhi Basu became the first women graduates of the University of Calcutta. Due to the proscriptions of female seclusion it soon became essential to introduce training for women in nursing and medicine; while the missionaries were the first to enrol, these professions started recruiting Indian women by the 1880s. After her graduation Kadambini decided to study medicine at the University of Calcutta, where a BA degree was adequate for admission to the course. Despite an official commitment to expand medical education among women the authorities granted her a place grudgingly: clearly, those in charge of women's education were not unaffected by the prejudices against its dissemination.<br>
<br>On 12 June 1883, shortly after entering medical college, Kadambini married Dwarakanath, by now a 39-year-old widower with six adult children. Dwarakanath had been her teacher, and clearly the two had become very close during Kadambini's later school years. The marriage caused a stir even among the reformist Brahmo Samaj; while there is no information on family responses, Dwarakanath's close friends and associates apparently disapproved and refused to attend the marriage ceremony. The leading women's journal <span class="italic">Bamabodhini Patrika</span>, which usually carried information on Brahmo Samaj marriages, made no mention of this interesting match and it is possible that Dwarakanath was viewed as having taken advantage of the emotions of a young woman assigned to his charge. By all accounts the marriage was an extremely successful one, and Dwarakanath fully supported Kadambini's further education and professional career.<br>
<br>In 1886 Kadambini passed in all the written papers of the final medical examination but failed in an essential component of the practicals; deliberate bias against her for being a woman was suspected. Instead of an MB degree she was awarded that of a GBMC (graduate of Bengal medical college), which enabled her to practise. In 1885 the Dufferin Fund (later known as the National Association for Supplying Female Medical Aid to the Women of India) was set up; the fund was the first systematic attempt at institutionalizing Western medicine and its use among Indian women. Clearly Kadambini was quick to take advantage of the facilities being made available for Indian women in the field of medicine and in 1888 was appointed a doctor at the Lady Dufferin Medical College on a monthly salary of Rs300. Kadambini soon had a flourishing practice and among her patients were women of the Nepalese royal family; the queen mother loaded her with gifts, which included a pony. In no time pony rides became popular with her two children and stepgrandchildren, to whom Kadambini was a remote and busy figure, different from all the other women they knew. Kadambini's clinic-cum-study held many mysteries for them, including a human skeleton. As she commuted between patients in a horse-drawn carriage she occupied herself with the ubiquitous feminine occupation of the times&#151;making fine lace, for which she gained some reputation.<br>
<br>Soon after the establishment of the Indian National Congress in 1885, Dwarakanath Ganguly began agitating for women's representation at the annual sessions and the 1889 Bombay session had a delegation of six women including Kadambini. The following year, at the Congress session at Calcutta, she delivered the vote of thanks in English, becoming the first Indian woman to speak at such occasions. Not unexpectedly, orthodox Hindus viewed Kadambini's career with deep misgivings. Fearing that their own women might emulate her, a section of conservatives launched a slander campaign, and in 1891 <span class="italic">Bangabasi</span>, a journal of the traditionalists, accused Kadambini of being a whore. Dwarakanath and other eminent Brahmos committed to women's emancipation launched a counter-offensive in the columns of a Brahmo publication, the <span class="italic">Indian Messenger</span>, where articles strongly criticized those who felt that the &#145;maintenance of female virtue is incompatible with their social liberty&#146;  (Kopf, 126). Dwarakanath was vindicated when the editor of the <span class="italic">Bangabasi</span>, Mohesh Chandra Pal, was fined Rs100 and sentenced to six months' imprisonment.<br>
<br>In 1892 Kadambini went to the United Kingdom for higher medical education and was made LRCP (Edin.), LRFPS (Glasgow), and DFPS (Dublin); at a time when women of her own class had barely started coming out in mixed company Kadambini's sojourn abroad further marked her out as an exceptional woman, intelligent, tenacious, and self-confident. During her long widowhood (Dwarakanath died on 27 June 1898), Kadambini continued to combine wider community activities with her professional life. At the beginning of the twentieth century she became the president of the Indian branch of the Transvaal Indian Association, established by Henry Pollack, a co-worker of M. K. Gandhi. A year before her death Kadambini became a member of a commission to enquire into the working conditions of women workers in Bihar and Orissa. Though little is known about her later years, family sources reported Kadambini's tireless commitment to her profession and to the cause of women in fast changing times. She died on 3 October 1923.<br>
