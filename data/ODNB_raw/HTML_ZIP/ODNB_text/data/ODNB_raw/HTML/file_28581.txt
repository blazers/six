<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wallop, Sir  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1492, <em>d.</em> 1551), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, was the eldest of three sons and a daughter of Stephen Wallop (<i>b</i>. in or after 1473, <i>d</i>. 1526/7), administrator, and his wife, Ashley (<i>d</i>. in or after 1515), only daughter of Hugh Ashley of Wimborne St Giles, Dorset, and his wife, Elizabeth. His younger brother Giles was born in 1491 or 1492. The Wallops were substantial members of the Hampshire gentry, having acquired the estate of Farleigh Wallop near Basingstoke through marriage early in the fifteenth century.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducationto1524"></a>Early years and education, to 1524</h2>Little is known about Wallop's education but it must have been reasonably thorough because throughout his life he displayed an aptitude for languages (including French and Spanish, and possibly German and Italian, though not Latin). The celebrated humanist Juan Luis Vives described how Wallop knew &#145;the customs and tongues of many men&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, no. 6795). He had two brothers, Giles (<i>b</i>. 1491/2, <i>d</i>. in or after 1530), a priest and notable scholar, and Sir Oliver Wallop (<i>c</i>.1502&#150;1566), and a sister, Margaret (<i>fl</i>. 1502&#150;1542), who married Thomas Barnaby. His uncles Richard Wallop (1455/6&#150;1503) and Sir Robert Wallop (1472/3&#150;1535) were regularly appointed sheriff of Hampshire between 1501 and 1524.<br>
<br>Sir Robert Wallop may have provided Wallop with an income as feoffee of his manor in Basing, Hampshire, in the last years of Henry VII's reign but it was insufficient to provide for his needs and, with little expectation of inheriting, he pursued a military career and was constantly on the lookout for preferment. He began this career principally serving in Henry VIII's navy and reputedly participated in Sir Edward Poyning's successful expedition to the Low Countries in 1511, the year in which his father was included in the Hampshire commission of array with Sir Robert Wallop. His military proficiency must already have been evident and he was promoted captain by 1512 and knighted in 1512 or 1513. He was joint captain with Sir John Wyseman of the <i>Henry Grace &agrave; Dieu</i> from April 1513. Wallop went on the reckless but chivalrous expedition to Brest of Sir Edward Howard, the lord admiral. He led a series of harsh raids on French coastal communities while commanding a succession of mid-size vessels during Henry's campaign in France in 1513&#150;14 and had joint command of a large squadron with Wyseman under Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey, in May 1514. He was also made one of the king's spears and continued to serve under Surrey during the summer. He revenged the French attack on the Sussex coast in autumn 1515 by retaliating effectively in a series of devastating raids on Normandy, despite inadequate manpower. At some point after September 1513 Wallop married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1516), daughter of Sir Oliver St John of Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire, and his wife, Elizabeth, and widow of Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare. She was a cousin of Henry VII and, although this made the match more prestigious, it is uncertain whether or not she regained control of her substantial dower lands or these passed to her son by her first marriage. She must have been considerably older than Wallop, suggesting he hoped her a rich widow. The marriage was short-lived and childless, with Lady Wallop dying on 28 June 1516. Wallop also participated in court life and his combination of martial skill, intelligence, learning, and prudence probably recommended him to the young Henry VIII, who began to employ him as a diplomat. His first mission, in August 1515, was to Margaret of Savoy, regent of the Low Countries.<br>
<br>Wallop led an itinerant life, spending the majority of his career serving abroad, and had an insatiable curiosity for foreign places. He served Manuel, king of Portugal, against the Muslims from 1516 to 1518, being sufficiently wealthy to fight at his own expense, an indication that he was not a mercenary but a volunteer. He probably lived off the booty he took, fighting near Tangier in Morocco, and was made a knight of the order of Christ. Wallop continued to favour the Portuguese on his return home. He was among the pensioners appointed in September 1518 to entertain the French embassy, meaning he was an active courtier rather than a supernumerary. He served in Ireland under Surrey, lord lieutenant between 1520 and 1522. Surrey had a high opinion of Wallop, appointing him vice-treasurer of Ireland, describing him to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in August 1520 as a &#145;man right mete to do the kynges grace gode service in his warrys &hellip; diligent and with goode will woll take payne in &hellip; thynges as from tyme to tyme you commande hym to do&#146;, and using him to bring money and supplies and to convey important news  (TNA: PRO, SP 60/1/14, fol. 43<i>r</i>). He was integral to Surrey's more aggressive policy as a negotiator in England on his behalf and asked the king in early 1521 for 300 cavalry and 500 infantry. He benefited from service and held the office of bailiff and receiver, then constable, of the lordship of Trim, co. Meath, from 1522 to 1524. He used this revenue to support Giles Wallop's education at the University of Louvain in the early 1520s and had an almost paternal relationship with his younger brother.<h2>
<a name="ServiceasadiplomatandatCalais15241535"></a>Service as a diplomat and at Calais, 1524&#150;1535</h2>Wallop was appointed marshal of the rearward during the war with France in 1522&#150;3 because of his expertise at leading raids, recently honed in the desultory fighting in Ireland, and in conducting sieges. He participated in the raid on Brittany and was among the first to storm Morlaix in July 1522, after which he garrisoned St Omer with 1000 men. He was then based in the Calais pale, from where he led devastating attacks on the French. He was vital to the taking of Montdidier and other French towns. Wallop was rewarded for his good service with appointment as high marshal of Calais on 31 March 1524. He defeated the French near St Omer in May but was subsequently forced to retire in the face of superior numbers. He lived at court or at one of his uncle's properties whenever he was in England and cultivated his Hampshire connections. For example, Sir John Paulet appointed him feoffee to uses on 2 January 1525.<br>
<br>Wallop was used increasingly as a diplomat from 1526, as were other men with military backgrounds, such as Poynings and Sir Richard Jerningham. The &#145;soldier diplomat&#146; was useful because he was regarded as tough, methodical, and honourable  (Potter, 104). Promotion to gentleman of the privy chamber in 1526 enhanced his status by giving Wallop additional prestige as an intimate of the king. He was sent with a large amount of money as special ambassador to Hungary in September 1526 in response to the Ottoman invasion. This mission was very important because of the prestige Henry could gain by saving Christendom from the Muslims and Wallop was chosen because of his military expertise. Wallop received an audience with Margaret of Savoy on 16 September. Then, after spending time in Cologne, Brussels, Mainz, and Augsburg, he received an audience with Ferdinand, king of the Romans, at Prague on 5 February 1527. Ferdinand discussed the situation in detail and, among other things, gave Wallop two large gilt cups, but subsequently proved unwilling to permit him to go to Hungary to speak with his rival Jan Zapolya, <i>voivode</i> of Transylvania. Wallop received an audience with Sigismund I, king of Poland, at Breslau in Silesia in early May at which they discussed the danger of Lutheranism. He was the first English ambassador to Poland. Wallop intended to return to Hungary in June and even considered going to Istanbul. He was at Vienna in July and probably returned to England the following month due to lack of funds.<br>
<br>Wallop continued to acquire offices and rewards. He was named, with Sir Richard Page, surveyor and receiver of the subsidies on kerseys in London and Southampton on 17 March 1528 with a joint salary of &pound;100. He was special ambassador to France between February and May and received an audience with Fran&ccedil;ois I at Poissy on 28 February. The French were keen that Wallop should not discover their intentions regarding relations with Charles V and had a very high opinion of his abilities, despite regarding him as pro-imperialist. The French ambassador in England, Jean du Bellay, bishop of Bayonne, commented that Sir John Russell was likely to replace Wallop and would be &#145;better than any other whose name is not Wallop&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 4/3, appendix, 190). Wallop returned to Calais in June. His father died at some point during 1526 or 1527 but he inherited little.<br>
<br>Wallop became keeper of the lordship and park of Ditton, Buckinghamshire, on 6 April 1529, making him responsible for running the estate and for raising tenants in time of war or insurrection. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1552), daughter of Sir Clement Harleston of South Ockendon, Essex, at Windsor Castle on 8 June 1530. She must have been considerably younger than him and had been in service to Anne Boleyn, continuing as a member of her circle after the marriage. Wallop was promoted to lieutenant of Calais on 23 June at a salary of &pound;56 10<i>s</i>. per annum. However, his pay was often in arrears and he got into debt. He had forty-nine soldiers under him but his charge, the castle overlooking the harbour, was woefully outdated and the weakest part in the Calais pale. Wallop was now the second most senior officer in the garrison after the deputy and was a member of the council, though he did not attend council meetings frequently. He was at Calais during the extensive repairs carried out in September and October 1531. Lady Wallop handled aspects of their finances, including receiving wages from the exchequer. Wallop was in an awkward position because he did not support Henry's attempts to divorce Katherine of Aragon. There were conflicting family loyalties over the divorce because Lady Wallop continued as a member of the Boleyn circle until at least 1532, but by December 1535 she was described as Katherine's &#145;creatura&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 9, no. 970). Despite this, Wallop was selected to be ambassador in France, although Surrey (now third duke of Norfolk) felt &#145;that such a charge was not altogether suitable for him, being more a man of war than of counsel&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 5, no. 1109). He was resident ambassador with a salary of &pound;486 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from 11 September 1532 to mid-March 1537.<br>
<br>Wallop arrived at the French court by 1 January 1533 and immediately became involved in delicate but intense negotiations in an attempt to gain Fran&ccedil;ois's support for the divorce. He returned to Calais at some point before July and nearly drowned at Newneham Bridge, perhaps as a result of deficiencies in the maintenance of the network of sluices there. With Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and Sir Francis Bryan he was present at the interview between Fran&ccedil;ois and Clement VII at Marseilles on 11 October. They were under strict instructions not to present themselves to the pope. Despite the tense circumstances, Bryan was convivial company. Wallop probably spent the first half of 1534 in England or at Calais but returned to the French court by October. He lived in a succession of inns and lodging houses. In 1534&#150;5 he skilfully negotiated a defensive league with Fran&ccedil;ois against Charles, whose reaction to the Henrician Reformation was a source of great anxiety, and then changed tactics by re-establishing good relations with the emperor when the situation eased. Henry had become disillusioned with the French alliance. Wallop also tried to persuade Philip Melanchthon to go to England in July 1535, in the hope that the reformer would support the Henrician Reformation. Thomas Cromwell, the king's secretary, instructed him to justify the executions of John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, to Fran&ccedil;ois. Cromwell and he may have been at odds as a consequence of Wolsey's fall but they briefly settled their differences. Other delicate tasks Wallop carried out included renegotiating the French pension and informing Fran&ccedil;ois, not without delight, of Anne's fall in May 1536. He spent time hawking during the summer. Wallop remained with the French court between October 1535 and March 1537. He was initially unimpressed by James V's reticent character when he met him in November 1536, telling the deputy of Calais, Arthur Plantagenet, sixth Viscount Lisle, that if it were not for the talkative nature of the Scottish king's prospective bride, Madeleine de Valois, &#145;the house should be very quiet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lisle Letters</span>, 3.524). His reports are valuable as observations of general developments in France and he played one party off against the other with some dexterity and <i>&eacute;lan</i>.<h2>
<a name="Hampshiregentlemanandgarrisoncommander15351547"></a>Hampshire gentleman and garrison commander, 1535&#150;1547</h2>Sir Robert Wallop died on 16 June 1535 and Sir John Wallop, his eldest nephew, inherited most of his property. Wallop lobbied hard for his recall from France because, as Henry put it, he had &#145;ever right honestly referred yourself as by your sundry lettres it apperethe to Returne hither into our Realme aswel to visyte and see us as to loke uppon suche youre inheritannce as sethens your departure hathe descended and fallen unto youe&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 25114, fol. 241<i>r</i>). Despite his frequent absences, Wallop tried to keep an eye on local developments. His client, John Coke, was registrar of Winchester and was involved in an ongoing and ultimately successful quarrel with the protestant John Palmes in the 1530s. Yet Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, could provide another protestant, Robert Vaws, with the living of Over Wallop, despite strong opposition from Wallop and the Hampshire clergy. Wallop was JP for Hampshire from 1538 to 1551. On 3 March 1539 he appointed his cousin John Cooke as one of his feoffees to uses. Cooke was receiver and surveyor of Wallop's lands by 1551. Before August 1545 Sir John and Oliver Wallop contracted with the lord chancellor, Thomas Wriothesley, Baron Wriothesley of Titchfield, for a marriage between <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28580/', "Henry Wallop (c.1531&#150;1599)")</script> and Anne Wriothesley. Wallop was one of the six gentlemen of the privy chamber who supported the canopy at the christening of Edward, prince of Wales, on 15 October 1537 and his wife attended the funeral of Jane Seymour on 12 November. He was granted the extensive lands of the dissolved monastery of Barlinch, Somerset, on 29 May 1538, including the manors of Brompton Ralph, Bury, and Warleigh, all in Somerset, and Morebath in Devon. Consequently, he spent part of the autumn in Somerset and was considered as a potential candidate as sheriff of Devon for 1538&#150;9. Wealth brought status. The schoolmaster Leonard Cox sought his literary patronage but Wallop was not supportive. Wallop did have one of his servants taught to play the viol, though. He returned to Calais in March 1539 because of renewed fears of war with France and from May was involved in the troubles there over religion through close association with William Sandys, first Baron Sandys and captain of Gu&icirc;nes, and with Lisle. They opposed the local protestants and used this against Cromwell. According to Sir George Carew, they &#145;shoyth them selwys unwyllyng that the word of god shold prosper &amp; go forward amongst us&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/151, fol. 226<i>r</i>). This divided the council and the junior officers.<br>
<br>Wallop and his wife were close friends of Lord and Lady Lisle, their relationship being reinforced by vicinage, both men being leading Hampshire landowners. He was on good terms with Sir Richard Grenville, high marshal, Sir Thomas Palmer, high porter, and the other senior officers at Calais. The letters between them provide a vivid picture of life in their circle at Calais and reveal Wallop's dry sense of humour. He wrote regularly to Lisle when away, even going into detail about the situation in France normally reserved for the king. On 18 December 1536 he wrote to congratulate Lisle on his impending fatherhood and expressed the hope that his own marriage would produce children, especially if his wife and he could &#145;return once quietly to the Castle&#146;. He bought Lady Lisle some special water at Avignon for the later stages of her pregnancy that, among other things, he assured her husband &#145;when a woman's breasts be long, it raiseth them higher and rounder, which peradventure shall be good for some of your neighbours&#146;. However, he hoped Lisle would not misconstrue his meaning by taking his comment to be derogatory towards his wife's appearance and pointed out that her figure was fine and she &#145;needeth not&#146; such cosmetic aid  (<span class="italic">Lisle Letters</span>, 3.571&#150;2). Wallop had no children.<br>
<br>Wallop was resident ambassador in France again from 2 February 1540 to March 1541, with an annual salary of &pound;730, and was instructed to sever ties between Fran&ccedil;ois and Charles and build close relations with Marguerite of Navarre. His secretary, Nicholas Alexander, was involved closely in these negotiations. Norfolk and Wallop received an audience with Fran&ccedil;ois in the king's bedchamber at Abbeville on 23 February 1540. The French king was on good terms with Wallop, who was uncertain about Franco-imperial relations. However, Wallop's work was done for him when Charles baulked at handing Milan over in April. He was appointed a commissioner of oyer and terminer, despite his absence, in June. Wallop was involved in the complex negotiations with the French over the Cowswade, within the Calais pale, between October 1540 and February 1541. Henry used tension over this to renegotiate his French pension.<br>
<br>Wallop was caught up in the religious faction of the early 1540s that was a consequence of Cromwell's fall. His Catholicism was well known and Henry became suspicious of him after hearing allegations of treason in June 1540. He was appointed captain of Gu&icirc;nes, the only modernized fortification in the Calais pale, in December but was recalled from France and examined in March 1541, as was Alexander. However, Henry handled the situation with care and despite seizing his papers and trying to elicit information through subterfuge, he permitted Wallop to speak openly in his defence to the privy council. Wallop was accused of conducting treasonable correspondence with Richard Pate and, realizing his safest course was to admit his guilt, he did so and submitted to the king's mercy. He was pardoned on 21 March and was restored as captain of Gu&icirc;nes in April, his appointment being confirmed on 7 July 1543, when he was also named commander of English forces in France. Wallop commanded a company of 100 cavalry and oversaw new engineering work at Calais in summer 1542. He frequently received instructions from the privy council on how to conduct his various duties, including provisioning the garrison and keeping &#145;a good eye unto the Pale, &amp;c&#146; and dealt carefully but effectively with numerous local matters that might impair the efficiency of his men, like the conduct of one soldier, Anthony Hutchinson, who spoke &#145;certeyne lewde and unsemely worddes&#146; while drunk  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1542&#150;7</i>, 54, 87). To try to prevent this behaviour from recurring he appointed Thomas Audley of St Ives, Huntingdon, provost marshal in August. Wallop used his diplomatic nature to good effect by coming to an accommodation in autumn 1542 with the local French commander, Oudart de Biez, marshal of France, that made their duties easier. This was part of a wider Anglo-French <i>rapprochement</i> in 1542&#150;3. Biez and he became good friends. They hunted in Gu&icirc;nes Forest together, sent each other gifts of venison, and their families dined with one another when the opportunity arose. Biez used these meetings to try to learn more about the modernization taking place at Calais, but Wallop had &#145;to muche practised a brode for a Frencheman / to pike [pick] any thinge owte of me&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/171, fol. 8<i>v</i>). Wallop advanced the military careers of promising young gentlemen, including that of James Wilford of Hartridge, Kent, whose aptitude for siege engineering and with ordnance he found striking when they met in June 1542.<br>
<br>Henry allied with Charles in February 1543. Wallop provided a detailed plan on how to conduct the campaign and was made captain-general of an army of between 5000 and 6000 men and sent to Calais to assist in the defence of the Low Countries in June. He invaded the Boulonnais in July, destroying fortifications and harbours and devastating the countryside. He then participated in the siege of Landrecies from September to November, during which he became ill. The emperor praised him for his professionalism and he retired with his men as the campaigning season drew to a close in November. Henry was so satisfied with Wallop's performance of his duties that he agreed to his nomination to the Order of the Garter on 24 December 1543. Wallop was installed on 18 May 1544, with the king providing him with the ceremonial robes from his own wardrobe. He was busy during the invasion of France in 1544 and maintained a large force at Gu&icirc;nes. In January 1545 he argued with the lieutenant of Hammes Castle, William Grey, thirteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, and despite attempts at mediation, their disagreement rumbled on into the autumn. Grey of Wilton was a difficult man to get on with. The privy council thanked Wallop for his bravery in June. In June 1546 he was placed on the second commission to determine the boundaries of the Boulonnais and was appointed to the third commission in March 1547.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears15471551"></a>Last years, 1547&#150;1551</h2>Wallop promptly ingratiated himself with the new regime, writing to Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset and lord protector to Edward VI, from Calais on 23 February 1547 and asking to &#145;remayne in suche aucthorytie and permynence at guisnes as I and other captenes have done&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 68/13, fol. 94<i>r</i>). He continued as captain of Gu&icirc;nes, being placed in command of the defence of English territory in France, and was reappointed JP for Hampshire in May, although he was removed from the privy chamber. Wriothesley (now first earl of Southampton) retained him as keeper of his newly acquired manor and park of Dogmersfield, Hampshire, in July. This friendship with the disgraced former lord chancellor did Wallop no harm and reflected their shared Catholicism. Wallop was involved in the defence of the outlying forts of Boulogne and Calais against the French in 1548&#150;9 and Russell (now Baron Russell), wrote to the lord admiral, Thomas Seymour, Baron Seymour of Sudeley, on 13 August 1548, describing how during one of the frequent skirmishes and, despite his age, Wallop &#145;findinge the lyke entertaynement abowte his parties [parts], made owte and slewe of those whiche came to seke playe, xij or xiiij: and put the rest to flight&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/4/44, M fol. 87<i>v</i>). Wallop was at court in early 1550 and retained the confidence of John Dudley, earl of Warwick, in the aftermath of the October coup against Somerset. Warwick wrote to the privy council on 1 February 1550 and, among others, asked them to commend him to &#145;myne olde acquayntance Sir John Wallop&#146;, to whom he intended to write on his return to court  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula E. iv, fol. 206<i>r</i>). Wallop was considered a reliable military client and, oddly, identified as a member of Warwick's protestant party. This was a surprising but adroit shift in loyalties for the old soldier and was probably based on Warwick's genuine admiration for Wallop, whom he knew through his late stepfather, Lisle. Wallop was a commissioner for settling the boundary of English territory in France. He was rewarded too, receiving an annuity of &pound;20 for life in June 1551.<br>
<br>Wallop made his last will on 22 May 1551. Even at the end he struck a neat balance between service and faith. The opening formula declared Edward to be &#145;supreme hed of the churche of England and Irelande&#146;, yet Wallop, using the traditional Catholic phrasing, commended his soul to God, while &#145;humbly desyring our Lady saynt Marie the virgyn mother of our lorde Jesus Christ / and all the holy company in heaven to be mediators and Intercessors for me&#146;. Testament to the strength of his marriage was his decision to appoint Lady Wallop his sole executor; she was to receive the revenue from part of his estates and his household goods during her life, and he remembered fondly, when leaving a bequest to Sir Edward Wotton, that it was &#145;my gilt cupp with a cover whiche I and my wief dyd use to drynke caudels in&#146;. Among others, he left bequests to Somerset, Warwick, his steward John Smale, and another cousin, Cooke, sergeant of the king's hart hounds. He left half a year's wages to his servants and provided an annuity for Alexander, now captain of Newneham Bridge, of &pound;6 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. He also petitioned the privy council &#145;to Remytt my said debt or parte therof&#146; (which amounted to &pound;138 9<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. in 1546), since it had been accrued through royal service, and to pay his wages until 17 October  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/34, sig. 24). Sir Oliver Wallop was his heir male and stood to inherit one of the largest estates in Hampshire. Sir John Wallop died at Gu&icirc;nes on 13 July, of the sweating sickness, a particularly virulent disease to which, peculiarly, the fittest were most susceptible, and was buried there after a substantial funeral ceremony, probably in the churchyard (having provided &pound;5 towards the church's restoration). His body was subsequently removed and reburied in the parish church at Farleigh Wallop. Henry Machyn's assessment epitomized the opinion of many of his contemporaries: &#145;gentyll sir John &hellip; was a nobull captayne as ever was&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Diary of Henry Machyn, Citizen and Merchant-Taylor of London, from 1550&#150;1563</span>, ed. J. G. Nichols, <span class="italic">Camden Miscellany</span>, 1st ser., 42, CS, 1848, 8). Wallop was the epitome of the Tudor gentleman, a brilliant naval officer and soldier (who kept abreast of changing tactics and military technology), long remembered for his skill as a commander, his professionalism, and his ferocity as a foe, a fine diplomat, and an able royal servant. His wife survived him and retired to South Ockendon but was in failing health by March 1552 and died shortly after.<br>
