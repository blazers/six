<span class="headword">Ramsey,  (Mary) Dorothea Whiting</span>  (1904&#150;1989), <span class="occ">social worker</span>, was born on 10 January 1904 in Kensington, London, the only child of Robert William Ramsey, solicitor, and his wife, Anna Whiting Brown, of Clarendon Road, in the Notting Hill area of London. Of well-to-do parents, she was educated at St Paul's Girls' School, London, and at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she obtained third classes in both parts of the classical tripos (1926 and 1928). She then taught Greek and Latin in London until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. It was as a voluntary worker with the Bristol Council of Social Service in the war emergency bureau that she became alerted to the social problems of elderly people, and, henceforward, her career concentrated on that area.<br>
<br>In 1941 Dorothea Ramsey helped to form the Bristol Old People's Welfare Committee and became its secretary. Just as wartime threw into vivid perspective the needs of deprived children when they were evacuated, so was the distress of many old people made more apparent. Dorothea Ramsey was one of the first to stress the value of residential care for older people, especially compared with the isolation of living, often in a feeble condition, at home or floundering in the large dormitories of the workhouse or the chronic sick wards of the former poor-law and other hospitals. She was to the fore in establishing, in 1942, the West Town House residential care home in Bristol, a small, model facility, only the second of its kind in the country.<br>
<br>Returning to London, in 1943 Dorothea Ramsey became a member of the advisory case subcommittee of social service, a body dealing with old people in distress and the mobilization of people likely to care for them. This had been set up not least as a consequence of the bombing, involving both injury and homelessness. This small-scale agency received 2000 requests for help each year, and was much pressed to find adequate residential and allied amenities for its needy elderly clients. As early as 1940 the National Council of Social Service, aware of the manifest difficulties of many older people, had convened a group of representatives of the major voluntary and statutory providers. Out of this initiative grew the National Old People's Welfare Committee, its remit the campaigning for and provision of decent social services for impoverished and sick old people. Soon it was to abandon its lengthy title, redolent of 1940s officialdom, in favour of the more user-friendly Age Concern.<br>
<br>Dorothea Ramsey became secretary of this new charity in 1945, and she fought hard and vigorously to improve conditions for its elderly clientele. During her seven-year secretaryship&#151;she resigned in 1952&#151;the number of groups grew rapidly from eight regional or county and eighty local committees to sixty-two regional or county and 831 local committees. Given her experience, it is not surprising that she concentrated on residential care, persuading both local old people's welfare groups and local authorities to build and sustain homes. She urged the value of professional training, successfully pressed for chiropody services, and sought for older people a reasonable degree of dignity and independence. Because of the work of men and women like Dorothea Ramsey during the post-war decades, a less negative attitude towards ageing began to develop. She was one of the first to take a more personal and less paternalist stand on social provision, insisting&#151;at a time when welfare was granted grudgingly in rather chilling vein&#151;that the criterion should be &#145;what you would like in similar circumstances&#146;. Her pioneering work led to recognition overseas, particularly in the USA, which she toured with a Smith&#151;Mundt scholarship in 1952.<br>
<br>On retirement to the Lake District, Dorothea Ramsey devoted herself to what had been a lifelong affection for music&#151;she had studied the flute under Gustav Holst as a girl&#151;and she applied her considerable administrative skills to the furtherance of orchestral and choral activity in Cumberland. She also played in and became chairman of the Cumberland Symphony Orchestra. Severe eye problems, arthritis, and diabetes constrained her life over thirty years, but she bore these handicaps with admirable fortitude. She was dark, of medium height, with intelligent, bright looks, and penetrating eyes. A woman of committed conscience, if somewhat shy, she never married. In retirement she lived with a friend, Frances M. Birkett. She had lived latterly at High Rigg Grange, Borrowdale, near Keswick, Cumberland, and died in Keswick on 27 September 1989.<br>
