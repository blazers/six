<span class="headword">May, Sir  Humphrey</span>  (1572/3&#150;1630), <span class="occ">politician and administrator</span>, was the fourth son of Richard May (<i>d</i>. in or before 1592), citizen and merchant tailor of London and of Mayfield, Sussex, and his wife, Mary Hillersden, possibly daughter of Andrew Hillersdon of Memland, Devon. Humphrey's father was probably the Richard May in receipt of foreign intelligence as secretary to the merchants in September 1586. Humphrey May matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 25 October 1588 aged fifteen. After graduating BA on 3 March 1592 he studied at the Middle Temple later that year. By February 1604 he was at court and had been appointed groom of the privy chamber.<br>
<br>May was MP for Bere Alston, Devon, from 1605 to 1610, and on 26 November 1607 he was granted the clerkship of the council for the court of Star Chamber, in reversion after William Mill and Sir Francis Bacon. Before 23 May 1611 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1615), sister of Sir William Uvedale of Wickham Market, Suffolk: on that date May and his wife were granted a pension of 16<i>s</i>. a day. A pension of 200 marks a year followed on 5 August, and on 10 December a grant of the clerkship of the signet, in reversion after Robert Kirkham. May was knighted in January 1613 at Newmarket and represented Westminster in the 1614 parliament. John Cusack complained of May's influence on 11 November 1615: &#145;Sir Hum. May can make any suit or suitor, be they ever so honest, disliked by the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1611&#150;18</i>, 327).<br>
<br>In May 1615 Jane May died in giving birth to a son, Richard, and on 3 February 1616 Sir Humphrey married again at St Mary's, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. His second wife was Judith (<i>bap</i>. 1598, <i>d</i>. 1661), daughter of Sir William Poley (1562&#150;1629), of Boxted, Suffolk, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of Sir Robert Jermyn of Rushbrooke, Suffolk. Their youngest son was the renowned courtier <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18418/', "Baptist May")</script>.<br>
<br>In January 1618 May was appointed surveyor of the court of wards. His next objective, the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster, was said to have forty-three suitors. By 6 March May had provoked the duke of Buckingham's displeasure by promising the reversion of his surveyorship to both Benjamin Rudyerd and Mr Packer to secure their support. May applied for the duke's favour, but offended him by also approaching William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. Through the mediation of Pembroke and Lucy Russell, countess of Bedford, May eventually received the appointment, securing Buckingham's agreement only after he offered the lease of the duchy house in London to the duke's mother and his post in Star Chamber to the duke's brother. May himself was also made to grovel that losing Buckingham's favour was a &#145;matter of extreme grief and discontentment&#146;  (Lockyer, 39). He was MP for Lancaster in the parliament of 1621&#150;2. He represented Leicester in 1624 and 1625, praising the former parliament on 11 March 1624 for their &#145;clear and plain dealing&#146;  (Cogswell, 194). On 10 May 1624 May's testimony was used in the impeachment of Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex. May was among his debtors, and his participation signified that the court had deserted Cranfield.<br>
<br>By 1624 May owned the manor and abbey of Carrow, Norfolk, in which county he accumulated church patronage. He also reportedly bought the manor of Froyle, Hampshire. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 6 March 1625 and became a privy councillor on 28 March. Later that year he was returned for Lancaster again, and in early July endeavoured to prevent the royal decision to demand tonnage and poundage in the absence of a parliamentary grant: &#145;Sir Humphry May, then Chancelor of the Dutchie, who, having travaild with much industrie in that service, but in vaine, &hellip; importund to a new attempt &amp; triall for staie or diversion of that worke&#146;  (Thompson, 177). Having failed to persuade Buckingham himself, May sent Sir John Eliot to remonstrate with him. Nevertheless, in the House of Commons he strenuously defended Buckingham's foreign policy and urged parliament to vote the king money so they could not be blamed for future failures. He also argued against the committal of Richard Mountague for his controversial book <span class="italic">Appello Caesarem</span>. He represented Leicester again in the parliaments of 1626 and 1628&#150;9. By May 1626 he probably maintained hopes of a barony. On 15 September 1626 he was appointed a commissioner for the sale of the king's lands and by January 1627 he was a commissioner for the forced loan. On 20 March that year Lady Hericke claimed he was &#145;a great favourite with the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1627&#150;8</i>, 120).<br>
<br>On 7 October 1627, with Buckingham's forces on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; in a rapidly deteriorating position, May reassured the duke of the continued favour of the king and privy council, but emphasized difficulties in supplying him, entreating him not to attempt too much:<blockquote>It is easy for us to set down on paper ships, and money, and arms, and victual, and men, but to congest these materials together, especially in such a penury of money, requires more time than the necessity of your affairs will permit. (Gardiner, 6.191)</blockquote>Buckingham's campaign ended in disaster but in the parliament of 1628 May asked the House of Commons to forgive and forget, urging MPs:<blockquote>you cannot resolve too soone for the kinge, neyther can you indeede give enough. But lett our harts joyne. Let forrane states knowe wee are united. Wee have here in towne six embassadors and they every day aske after us. (C. Russell, <span class="italic">Unrevolutionary England, 1603&#150;1642</span>, 1990, 47)</blockquote>On 3 June Sir John Eliot argued that the French war had led to the sacrifice of the Palatinate and that the whole policy of the government looked pro-Spanish. When May interjected, &#145;If he goes on I hope that I may myself go out&#146;, the members cried, &#145;Begone! begone!&#146;  (Gardiner, 6.299). On 11 July 1628 May was named a commissioner for compounding with recusants in the northern counties, whose forfeitures were to maintain six warships to guard the east coast.<br>
<br>May defended the government on the tonnage and poundage issue on 19 February 1629, orating that he had never heard until now that an MP &#145;should have his goods privileged against the king&#146; and that &#145;God forbid that the king's commands should be put for delinquency. When that is done his crown is at stake&#146;  (Gardiner, 7.61&#150;3). During the ensuing debates over whether the House of Commons had the right to adjourn itself, on 2 March 1629 the speaker, Sir John Finch, was held down in his chair. May was among the privy councillors who rushed to assist him, but was overpowered. After the dissolution in April 1629 May resigned his chancellorship and was appointed vice-chamberlain. On 27 January 1630 he was also appointed commissioner for fining gentlemen that had not presented themselves for knighthood at Charles I's coronation.<br>
<br>Often placed in the awkward position of having to defend the government's unimpressive record, May was &#145;a man of some ability and of a very conciliatory disposition&#146;  (Gardiner, 5.319). He was a significant royal agent in nearly all the schemes that later came to characterize &#145;Thorough&#146;. May held the reversion of the mastership of the rolls, but did not live to enjoy it. He died at his house in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Middlesex, on 9 June 1630. Rowland Woodward wrote: &#145;Sir Humphrey May died last night. The common speech has been that he was mad; none of his friends for a great while were suffered to speak with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1629&#150;31</i>, 287). He was buried on 11 June 1630 on the north side of the chapel of kings in Westminster Abbey.<br>
