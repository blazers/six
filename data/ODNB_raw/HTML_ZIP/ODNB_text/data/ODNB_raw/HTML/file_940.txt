<span class="headword">Aylward,  Theodore</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1731, <em>d.</em> 1801), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was baptized on 25 July 1731 at St Peter's, Chichester, the son of Henry Aylward, gentleman, and his wife, Ann. Of his education nothing is known, though when young he seems to have sung at Drury Lane Theatre; he later composed music for productions at Drury Lane, including <span class="italic">Harlequin's Invasion</span>, <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span> (both 1759), and <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1763). He became a member of the Royal Society of Musicians on 3 July 1763 and was elected by a unanimous vote into the Madrigal Society on 15 November 1769. About 1760 he became organist of Oxford Chapel, London, and on 21 May 1762 was also appointed to St Lawrence Jewry. He resigned from Oxford Chapel in 1768 following his appointment to St Michael Cornhill on 29 April. On 5 June 1771 he was appointed professor of music at Gresham College. Aylward was an assistant director at the Handel commemorations of 1784, 1790, and 1791. He became a member of the Chichester Catch Club on 2 November 1787 and a founder member of the Glee Club (London) on 22 December of the same year. On 19 April 1781 he resigned from St Michael Cornhill in order to &#145;reside out of town&#146;  (Dawe, 75). In July 1787 he established his principal residence in South Street, Chichester, &#145;for the second time&#146;  (<span class="italic">John Marsh Journals</span>, 404). His London residence from at least 1782 was 9 Great Square, Gray's Inn. On 10 May 1788 Aylward was appointed organist of St George's Chapel, Windsor, whereupon he moved to a house in the castle. He was also private organist to Queen Charlotte, and taught at a school in Queen Square, London. On 19 and 21 November 1791 he took the accumulated degrees of BMus and DMus at Oxford, submitting the anthem &#145;I will cry unto God&#146;. He is not believed to have married, but had a daughter by one Susan Small. He died on 27 February 1801 in either Windsor or London and was buried on 5 March in St George's Chapel. At his death his properties included a collection of musical instruments, which were sold to finance bequests of at least &pound;2000. Aylward published a few songs and glees, a set of lessons for the harpsichord (op. 1, 1784), and six string quartets (op. 4, 1795?). Incomplete manuscript copies of two morning services and five anthems survive at St George's Chapel. Described as a &#145;stout Dutch-built man&#146;  (W. Ayrton, Royal College of Music, London, MS 2170), he was said by W. L. Bowles to have had &#145;considerable literary attainments&#146;  (G. Grove, <span class="italic">A Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, 1879). But Edward Taylor thought him &#145;not a musician by spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Grove</span>).<br>
