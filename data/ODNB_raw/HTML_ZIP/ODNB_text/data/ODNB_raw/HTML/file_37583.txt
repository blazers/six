<span class="headword">Hunt,  Henry George Bonavia</span>  (1847&#150;1917), <span class="occ">founder of Trinity College of Music, London</span>, was born on 30 June 1847 in Valletta, Malta, the eldest surviving son of William Hunt, former private secretary to the bishop of Jerusalem, and his second wife, Marietta Bonavia, the daughter of a Maltese doctor of Italian extraction. He was educated at King's College School, London, and studied law at the Temple in the early 1870s. On 15 August 1870 he married Louisa Madeline, the daughter of Eugene Carless, a chemical manufacturer, of Stratford. They had two sons and two daughters. On becoming choirmaster at South Hackney parish church in 1872, Hunt gathered the support of leading organists and choirmasters in London and set up an independent institution to provide better training for church musicians known as the Church Choral Society and College of Church Music.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Hunt was studying music in his spare time. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1872 and graduated BMus in 1876. He extended the aims of the College of Church Music, and in 1875 incorporated it for the purpose &#145;by special licence under Act of Parliament&#146; as Trinity College, London. He was warden from 1872 to 1892. To equip future students to sit for degrees in music made newly available at London University after 1879, he now arranged an &#145;arts&#146; class at the college to prepare candidates for matriculation, while broadening the music curriculum to conform with the university's new syllabuses. Then in 1879 he sought affiliation with the University of Durham; but objections by the Royal Academy and Royal College of Music prevented his developing stronger links with either university.<br>
<br>Hunt was ordained at Winchester in 1878. Following curacies at Esher in Surrey, St Philip's in Regent Street (1882&#150;3), and St James's, Piccadilly (1884&#150;7), he became minister of St Paul's, Kilburn, in 1887 and vicar in 1897. In all these appointments he was popular both as preacher and pastor, and became well known as a choirmaster. At St James's, Piccadilly, William Ewart Gladstone was often in the congregation, and suggested a royal chaplaincy, but by then Hunt had taken up the Kilburn appointment. He kept up his musical activities, and in 1887 graduated DMus (Trinity College, Dublin).<br>
<br>Energetic and many-sided, Hunt edited or sub-edited several popular magazines and journals, including <span class="italic">The Quiver</span> (1865&#150;1905) and <span class="italic">Cassell's Magazine</span> (1874&#150;96), besides founding and, until 1876, editing a children's paper, <span class="italic">Little Folks</span>. He also composed a little, and his works include a motet, <span class="italic">The Blessed Dead</span>, and a <span class="roman">Magnificat</span> and <span class="roman">Nunc dimittis</span> in B[flat]. Between 1900 and 1906 he was lecturer in music history at London University, and his <span class="italic">Concise History of Music</span> (1878) was much used; it reached a nineteenth edition in 1915. In addition, he was chairman of Willesden school board from 1899 to 1902, and was the founder and first warden of Kilburn grammar school (1897&#150;1904). On his induction as vicar of the parish church of St John the Evangelist, Burgess Hill, Sussex, in 1905, Hunt resigned his remaining London appointments. He died of heart failure under anaesthetic during a routine operation on 27 September 1917 in Hove.<br>
