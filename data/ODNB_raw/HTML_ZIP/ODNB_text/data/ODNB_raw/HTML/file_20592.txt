<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  David</span>, styled sixth earl of Airlie  (1725&#150;1803), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was the eldest son of John Ogilvy, styled fifth earl of Airlie (1699&#150;1761), and Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1767), eldest daughter and heir of David Ogilvy of Cluny, Aberdeenshire. He was born in Scotland on 16 February 1725, and educated in Perth and afterwards perhaps at King's College, Aberdeen, and at Edinburgh University. A scion of a family whose Stuart loyalism is commemorated in the song &#145;The Bonnie Hoose o Airlie&#146;, he was commissioned as Jacobite lord lieutenant of Angus (Forfarshire) before the beginning of the 1745 rising, and promised his services to Prince Charles Edward at Perth in September. Ogilvy joined the Jacobite army with a battalion of Angus men on 3 October 1745, going off thereafter to raise the excise there. He was accompanied by his wife, the &#145;strikingly beautiful&#146; Margaret [<a name="cosubject_75062"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Ogilvy</span>, Lady Ogilvy  (1724&#150;1757)], daughter of Sir James Johnstone, baronet, of Westerhall, Lanarkshire, and niece of Patrick Murray, Lord Elibank; they had a son, David, who did not assume the title, and two daughters. Not only did Lady Ogilvy share in the hardships of the army in Scotland, she also took an active part in the campaign, &#145;standing upon the Cross of Cupar in Angus with a drawn sword in her hand&#146; on one occasion  (Seton and Arnot, 3.238&#150;9). The anti-Jacobite tract <span class="italic">The Female Rebels</span> (1747) described her as an exemplar of the &#145;unwomanly&#146; qualities of female Jacobitism, exchanging &#145;delicacy of sentiment, mercy, tenderness, and compassion, the peculiar ornaments of the fair sex&#146; for the immoral and wanton activities of the &#145;wild transports of lawless ambition, the lust of power, cruelty, revenge&#146;  (Mackenzie, 247). Ogilvy's Forfarshire regiment (which later included a second battalion raised under Sir James Kinloch when Ogilvy was in England) is the best-attested of all the Jacobite units, since a detailed regimental order book survives (printed in volume one of the Spalding Club <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> in 1841). Its maximum strength was about 800, and it is instructive to note that the names of many ordinary lowland small-town tradesmen and merchants appear on its muster roll. Chosen as one of the prince's council of war and privy council, Ogilvy was among the majority who expressed reservations concerning Charles's conduct during the rising, being also (with Elcho and Lord George Murray) highly critical of the prince's Irish advisers. Despite the composition of his own regiment, he was also disappointed at the lack of greater lowland support. Irritated by being allotted what he deemed the &#145;dirty work&#146; of command of the baggage train after the fall of Carlisle  (McLynn, <span class="italic">Jacobite Army</span>, 46), he threatened to resign his commission. At Derby he was among the foremost of those arguing for a retreat at the council of war.<br>
<br>On the army's return to Scotland, during which some of his soldiers had been sacrificed in the garrison at Carlisle, Ogilvy's regiment was involved in the ill-fated siege of Stirling. At Falkirk both battalions stood at the centre of the Jacobite second line; Lady Ogilvy herself insisted on being up with the reserve. At the battle of Culloden, ordered back from the right flank into the reserve, they were, at the end of the battle, the only intact regiment who had taken part: even so, in the confusion Ogilvy was reported dead after the battle. Facing about several times as they withdrew in formation, by keeping Lieutenant-General Henry Hawley's cavalry in check the Forfarshires saved much of the right wing of the Jacobite army. Many retreated intact back to Angus, where units of Ogilvy's regiment seem to have caused trouble to the government for some time. After the battle, Ogilvy skulked in his own country before escaping via Bergen, in Norway (where he was briefly confined in May 1746), and Sweden to France, Lady Ogilvy meanwhile being taken prisoner by Cumberland in Inverness. In June she was sent to Edinburgh, but contrived to make her escape in November, joining her husband in France, where she died in 1757.<br>
<br>Once he arrived in exile, Ogilvy was seen as &#145;inclined &hellip; to make a figure in France&#146;, as Lochiel put it  (McLynn, <span class="italic">Jacobites</span>, 129). This he did, gaining command of Ogilvy's regiment in 1748 and eventually rising to lieutenant-general in Louis XV's service. Ogilvy's regiment was mentioned for possible use in subsequent Jacobite attempts: it was the place where &#145;most of the refugees from the [Jacobite] army &hellip; seeking further military service found a haven&#146;  (Gibson, 166). In exile, he continued to write to his family under pseudonyms drawn from their locality, such as Eskside, Elyth (or Alyth), and Lintrathen (the original title was Lord Ogilvy of Alith and Lintrathen). Following his father's death in July 1761 he became titular sixth earl of Airlie. Nine years later he married his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1798), daughter of James Stewart of Blairhill, Perthshire; they had no children.<br>
<br>In 1778 Ogilvy was pardoned by George III and returned to Scotland, where his pardon was confirmed by parliament in 1783. He was the recipient of a French pension, which Napoleon offered to continue on his coming to power: Ogilvy declined. He died at Cortachy on 3 March 1803. He was among &#145;the most handsome of the Jacobite commanders&#146;  (McLynn, <span class="italic">Jacobite Army</span>, 19) and, as a near contemporary put it, &#145;a nobleman of the old school, kind and indulgent to his menials and dependents, of the most correct manners, full of courtesy, integrity, and honour&#146;  (Douglas, 1.35&#150;6). On the death, without issue, of his son, David Ogilvy, Walter Ogilvy of Clova laid claim to the title of earl of Airlie before the House of Lords, but failed to elicit from them any decision. Walter's son David was, however, continued in the title by act of parliament on 26 May 1826.<br>
