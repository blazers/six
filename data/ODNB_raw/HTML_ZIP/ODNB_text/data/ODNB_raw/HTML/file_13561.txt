<span class="headword">Hollingworth,  Richard</span>  (1639?&#150;1701), <span class="occ">royalist writer</span>, was born in Lincolnshire, perhaps the son of Simonde Hollingworth of Stewton, near Louth, and baptized on 6 October 1639. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 5 February 1655 and graduated in 1659; he proceeded MA in 1662 and DD in 1684. He was ordained by Robert Sanderson, bishop of Lincoln, and in 1663 was licensed to a lectureship in London by Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, on the recommendation of John Dolben, archbishop of York. On 18 April 1672 he became vicar of West Ham, Essex, and between 1673 and 1681 he published several sermons attacking nonconformists as well as one at the execution of John Marketman at Chelmsford gaol (1680). In 1682 Hollingworth resigned West Ham to become curate to James Adern, rector of St Botolph, Aldgate, London, where he officiated at the marriage, by special licence, of Daniel Defoe on 1 January 1684. Following Adern's resignation Hollingworth succeeded to the living, but he was ejected after an action by Samuel Brewster, the impropriator, in 1693. Hollingworth may have been involved in the trade of clandestine marriages, and was summoned before the ecclesiastical commission on 2 October 1686 for marrying people without licences. From 22 January 1691 he was also vicar of Chigwell, Essex, where he moved in 1693 on his ejection from St Botolph.<br>
<br>Hollingworth is remembered for his part in the complex and heated exchange of pamphlets between 1691 and 1693 debating the authorship of <span class="italic">Eikon basilike: Pourtraicture of his Sacred Majestie in his Solitudes and Sufferings</span>. Doubts over the authorship of <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span>, popularly ascribed to Charles I, had been expressed since its appearance in 1649, but were rekindled in 1690 by the insertion of the &#145;Anglesey memorandum&#146; in a new edition of John Milton's <span class="italic">Eikonoklastes</span>, asserting that the work had been written by John Gauden, later bishop of Worcester. This claim was supported by Anthony Walker of Bocking, Gauden's former curate. The following year an anonymous republican pamphleteer, using the name of the regicide Edmund Ludlow, published <span class="italic">A Letter from Major-General Ludlow to Sir E[dward] S[eymour]</span>, in Amsterdam, which criticized Charles I, comparing his tyranny with that of James II. Hollingworth was incensed by these claims and attacked both Walker and Ludlow in equally intemperate terms in <span class="italic">A Defence of King Charles I: Occasion'd by the Lyes and Scandals of many Bad Men of this Age</span>, in December 1691. (Another work on the same subject, <span class="italic">Vindiciae Carolinae</span>, published in 1692 and once attributed to Hollingworth, is now ascribed to John Wilson, author of <span class="italic">A Discourse of Monarchy</span>.) Anthony Walker responded to Hollingworth's attack with modesty and obvious sincerity in <span class="italic">A true account of the author of a book entitled &#145;Eikon basilike&#146; &hellip; proved to be written by Dr. Gauden &hellip; with an answer to all objections made by Dr. Hollingsworth and others</span>. Edmund Ludlow responded in less measured terms with <span class="italic">A Letter from General Ludlow to Dr. Hollingworth</span> (1692), accusing him of hypocrisy in defending a cause he had formerly reviled.<br>
<br>Walker died before his book appeared in May 1692, but nevertheless Hollingworth returned to attack him with <span class="italic">Dr. Hollingworth's defence of K. Charles the First's holy and divine book &hellip; against the rude and undutiful assaults of the late Dr. Walker</span>. Likewise he responded to Ludlow with <span class="italic">A second defence of King Charles I by way of reply to an infamous libel called Ludlow's letter to Dr. Hollingworth</span>. This work called forth another largely scurrilous reply entitled <span class="italic">Ludlow no lyar, or, A detection of Dr. Hollingworth's disingenuity in his second defence of King Charles I &hellip; together with a reply to the false and malicious assertions in the doctor's lewd pamphlet</span> (1692); it was addressed to Luke Milbourne, described as a minister of Great Yarmouth and &#145;Assistant to Dr Hollingworth in his mighty undertakings&#146;, who later achieved notoriety as a satirist and for his high-church sermons. The Ludlow pamphlets have since been variously attributed to Slingsby Bethel, John Phillips, Thomas Percival, and more recently John Toland, the editor and biographer of Milton. Hollingworth again responded in kind with <span class="italic">The character of King Charles I from the declaration of Mr. Alexander Henderson &hellip; with a further defence of the king's holy book: to which is annex'd some short remarks upon a vile book, call'd Ludlow no lyar</span>. Late in 1692 Thomas Long, prebendary of Exeter, joined the debate with <span class="italic">Dr Walker's true, modest and faithful account &hellip; strictly examined, and demonstrated to be false, impudent and deceitful</span>. Both of these works were answered by an anonymous work <span class="italic">The plain dealer: an essay wherein are some remarks upon Mr. Thomas Long, but more particularly upon Dr. Hollingworth's book</span>. Ludlow also responded with <span class="italic">Truth brought to light, or, The gross forgeries of Dr. Hollingworth, in his pamphlet intituled, The character of King Charles the First &hellip; detected, being a vindication of Mr. Henderson and Dr. Walker, from the Aldgate chaplain's vile scandals</span>, which appeared early in 1693.<br>
<br>Hollingworth attempted to reply yet again in a sermon commemorating the anniversary of the execution of Charles I, entitled <span class="italic">The Death of King Charles I Proved a Down-Right Murder</span>, which was published in February 1693, but thereafter he appears to have withdrawn from the continuing pamphlet war, possibly due to his ejection from his London living.<br>
<br>Hollingworth died at Chigwell in October 1701, and his widow, Margaret, was granted the administration of the estate on the 28th of that month. The controversy over <span class="italic">Eikon basilike</span> had the effect of bringing to light a range of conflicting evidence and the testimonies of several surviving witnesses (details of which are discussed in an appendix to Madan, 126&#150;63), but without resolving the matter. Hollingworth's heated and outspoken language and unsubstantiated accusations against his enemies did not endear him to contemporaries. According to Richard Baxter, some of the accusations in his sermons were &#145;a meer fiction&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.180).<br>
