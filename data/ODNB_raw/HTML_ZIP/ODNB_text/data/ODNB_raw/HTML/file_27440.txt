<span class="headword">Tierney,  Mark Aloysius</span>  (1795&#150;1862), <span class="occ">historian</span>, born at Brighton in September 1795, was sent at an early age to the school directed by the Franciscan fathers at Baddesley Green, Warwickshire, from which he was transferred in 1810 to St Edmund's College at Old Hall Green, near Ware. He completed a programme in classical studies with distinction, and in 1815, while still a student, became professor of mathematics and plainchant. In 1818 he was ordained to the priesthood, though he remained at the college as professor and procurator until 1819, when he was appointed assistant priest at Warwick Street, London. He was later transferred to Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>Because of ill health, from which he suffered throughout his life, Tierney was moved to the country mission of Slindon, Sussex, the estate of the Newburgh family, where he remained until 1824, when he became chaplain to Bernard Edward Howard, twelfth duke of Norfolk. For the rest of his life he lived at Arundel, where he had ample leisure to pursue his historical and antiquarian studies. On 7 February 1833 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and on 25 July 1841 a fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a corresponding member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. On the formation of the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1846 he became its local secretary, and in 1850 he also joined the committee. He supervised many papers for the society, and contributed in 1849 to volume 3 of its <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> &#145;Notices of recent excavations in the collegiate church of Arundel&#146;, and in 1860 to volume 12 &#145;An account of the discovery of the remains of John, seventeenth earl of Arundel&#146;.<br>
<br>For many years Tierney was a member of the old chapter of England, established in 1623, and when the diocese of Southwark was created by Pope Pius IX in 1852 he became the first canon penitentiary of the cathedral chapter. Throughout much of his life Tierney was identified with a group of Catholics who were opposed to the policies of Nicholas Wiseman, first archbishop of Westminster. The antagonism between the two men seems to have dated from at least 1837 when Wiseman, one of the founders of the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, appointed his friend Henry Bagshawe as editor of the journal in spite of the fact that Tierney had served briefly in the position. Considered to represent a Gallican, or anti-Roman, position, Tierney, along with other English Catholics including the historian John Lingard, disapproved of what they judged to be undue Roman influence and practice, as well as a tendency to favour the regular over the secular clergy. In 1858 Tierney entered into public controversy with Wiseman, who denied that Lingard had been created a cardinal <i>in petto</i> (never announced) by Pope Leo XII. Tierney expressed himself intemperately in an article entitled &#145;Was Dr Lingard actually a cardinal?&#146;, which was published in <span class="italic">The Rambler</span> in 1858. When Wiseman responded in a printed but unpublished letter to his chapter, Tierney responded in kind in &#145;A reply to Cardinal Wiseman's letter to his chapter&#146; (1858), also printed but not published.<br>
<br>Tierney's chief work was a new edition of Charles Dodd's <span class="italic">Church History of England</span> (5 vols., 1839&#150;43). Because it was considered inopportune to reopen the seventeenth-century controversies between the secular and regular clergy, especially the Jesuits, Tierney was directed to discontinue his edition, which is therefore incomplete, ending with the year 1625. Most of the documents printed in the valuable notes to this edition were collected by John Kirk of Lichfield. Tierney contributed a &#145;Life of Dr. John Lingard&#146; to the <span class="italic">Metropolitan and Provincial Catholic Almanac</span> in 1854; this memoir was afterwards prefixed to volume 10 of the sixth edition of Lingard's <span class="italic">History of England</span>, published in 1855. He also assisted Edmund Cartwright with his <span class="italic">History of the Western Division of the County of Sussex</span> (1830).<br>
<br>Tierney died at Arundel on 19 February 1862, and was buried in the Fitzalan chapel in Arundel Castle. He left all his manuscripts to Thomas Grant, bishop of Southwark, and they are now housed in the Southwark Diocesan Archives. His printed books were sold by Sotheby &amp; Co. on 1&#150;4 December 1862.<br>
