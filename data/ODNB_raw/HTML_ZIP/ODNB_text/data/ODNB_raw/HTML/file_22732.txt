<span class="headword">Preston, Sir  Gilbert  of</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1209, <em>d.</em> 1274), <span class="occ">justice</span>, came of a family which took its name from the village of Preston Deanery in Northamptonshire, and which was part of a holding of two knights' fees belonging to the honour of Huntingdon, which the Prestons had held since at least the mid-twelfth century. A holding of two knights' fees at Little Billing and Hulcote in the same county, which formed part of the honour of Chokes, had been held by the family since the time of the <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span>. Gilbert of Preston was the son of the <a name="cosubject_22732"></a><span class="headword">Walter  of Preston</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1230)<span class="occ"></span>, who obtained a fee farm grant of the Northamptonshire royal demesne manor of Gretton in 1204, and was sheriff of Northamptonshire between 1206 and 1208; Walter rebelled against King John but procured the restoration of his lands in 1217, and was subsequently involved in other local administrative activities on behalf of the crown until his death, which had occurred by October 1230.<br>
<br>Gilbert of Preston began his career in the king's service by acting as one of the collectors of an aid in Northamptonshire in 1235/6, and in 1240 he received his first appointment as a royal justice. Between 1240 and 1254 he was employed almost continuously as one of the puisne justices on successive eyre circuits led by William of York, Roger of Thirkleby, and Henry of Bath, and in the common bench at Westminster; he also received a number of miscellaneous judicial and administrative commissions. In most years he received some payment from the king, but was not put on a regular salary (of &pound;40 a year) until 1253. This was at a time when arrangements started being made for the regular payment of most royal justices.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1254 Preston became the senior justice of an eyre circuit for the first time, though he also continued, when not on eyre, to act as a puisne justice of the Westminster bench. It was not until Michaelmas term 1260 that he sat for the first time as senior justice of that court. Shortly before this (in February 1260) his salary had been raised to 100 marks a year. Between Michaelmas term 1261 and Michaelmas term 1267 Preston sat continuously as senior justice of the common bench, except when sessions of the court were suspended because of political disturbances, but between the beginning of 1268 and the end of 1272 he once again left Westminster to lead an eyre circuit. He returned to Westminster only when eyres were suspended on the death of Henry III. His final period as chief justice of the common bench was during 1273, the last year of his life.<br>
<br>Preston's wife, Alice, was the daughter of Christine, the daughter and heir of Wischard Ledet, lord of the barony of Chipping Warden, and her first husband, Henry of Braybrooke (<i>d</i>. 1234). They were married by 1239. There is no evidence that they had any children: there was a donor to the priory of St Andrew, Northampton, called Sybil, daughter of Gilbert of Preston, but she was probably the daughter of an earlier namesake belonging to the same family. The justice's heir was Laurence of Preston, the son of his (predeceased) younger brother, William. Gilbert of Preston also had a second brother, Michael, whose lands, forfeited for adherence to the Montfortians, were granted to him in 1265; Michael was subsequently admitted into the king's peace at the request of Roger Leyburn (in 1266). Gilbert of Preston probably died early in January 1274. He had made provision some years before his death for the welfare of his soul through a grant of land in Lincolnshire to the prior of Sempringham in return for the provision of a canon of the order to celebrate at Sempringham for the donor, his ancestors, and heirs, and also by a grant of property at Gretton in Northamptonshire to support a chantry in the parish church there.<br>
