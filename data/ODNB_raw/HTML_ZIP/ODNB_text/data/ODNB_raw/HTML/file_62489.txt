<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Haston,  Duncan Curdy McSporran <span class="st"> [Dougal]</span></span>  (1940&#150;1977), <span class="occ">mountaineer</span>, was born on 19 April 1940 at 21 Dolphin Road, Currie, Midlothian, Scotland, the second of two children of Robert Bremner Haston (1900&#150;1972), journeyman baker, and his wife, Margaret Curdy McSporran (1900&#150;1967). He was educated at state schools in Currie and, an early beneficiary of British educational reforms easing working-class access to higher education, attended Edinburgh University in 1959 to read philosophy, but did not complete his degree.<br>
<br>Youthful adventures on the Currie Railway walls were followed by Haston's first visits to the highlands while at West Calder high school. By the late 1950s he had become a serious climber on rock and snow and ice. He was part of the small group of Edinburgh climbers who helped to regenerate Scottish climbing at this time, and he made a number of important first ascents. Haston also began climbing in the Alps, and came to prominence with the second British ascent of the north face of the Eiger in 1963.<br>
<br>At Easter 1965 Haston was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in the death of a hiker in Glencoe. He was charged with causing death by careless driving and served a sixty-day prison sentence. His friends disagree about the chastening effect of the incident, but he never drove again. Subsequently, Haston decided to devote himself to alpinism and began to spend the majority of his time outside the UK.<br>
<br>Haston joined John Harlin at the International School of Mountaineering (ISM) at Leysin, Switzerland, where they planned a direct ascent of the north face of the Eiger. The successful ascent in winter 1966, on which he teamed up with a rival German group, made Haston famous, but Harlin fell and was killed when a rope broke during the climb (Gillman and Haston; Haston, <span class="italic">The Eiger</span>).<br>
<br>Haston took over from Harlin as director of the ISM in 1967, and carried out a series of major ascents (including first ascents and first winter ascents) in the Alps, and a notable early attempt on Cerro Torre (Patagonia, 1968), during the next three years. He met Anne Jennifer (Annie) Farris, an English registered nurse, at Leysin; they married on 8 October 1969. The marriage is given one line in his autobiography (<span class="italic">In High Places</span>, 1972) which, characteristic of the terse style of writing he developed at university (cf. &#145;Nightshift in Zero&#146;, <span class="italic">Edinburgh University Mountainering Club Journal</span>, 1962), contains very few details of his private life. The &eacute;lite French Groupe de Haute Montagne invited him to join in 1969, and Annie notes that he was &#145;inordinately proud&#146; of being one of the first foreigners admitted.<br>
<br>In 1970 Haston and Don Whillans (1933&#150;1985) reached the summit of Annapurna via the south face&#151;the first major face route in the Himalayas. Midlothian county council presented him with an address on 19 May 1971, in honour of his mountaineering achievements; and he was also awarded the Royal Scottish Geographical Society medal. In 1975, during the south-west face expedition, Haston and Doug Scott became the first British climbers to reach the summit of Everest. This was the sixth attempt on the difficult high-altitude route (Haston had been on three of the previous attempts), and the best publicized, adding to Haston's fame. His other important ascents with Scott include Changabang (Himalayas, 1974), and the south face of McKinley (Alaska, 1976).<br>
<br>Scott notes that Haston &#145;was very much like a Sherpa&#151;reticent, self-contained, economical in word and deed&#146;; he &#145;never wasted a step&#146;. Other views of Haston characterize him on the one hand as anti-social, critical, icy, and aloof, and on the other as a hard-drinking risk taker who, according to Jimmy Marshall, &#145;set out to test every transgression, every canon prevailing in climbing society&#146;. His appearance also left a strong impression. Jim Gilchrist likened him to a rock star, and Dennis Gray to a Pre-Raphaelite poet. Robin Campbell recalled Dougal's &#145;long loping stride, narrow hips, wide shoulders, a lipless grin and bright blue bivouacked eyes&#146;  (Campbell).<br>
<br>Dougal Haston died in an avalanche while skiing alone below the Col de Luisset, near Leysin, on 17 January 1977. The accident was foreshadowed in his novel <span class="italic">Calculated Risk</span> (1979), which his girlfriend, Ariane Giobellina, typed up and sent to a publisher after his death. The title captures Haston's driving, single-minded, and self-reliant approach to climbing. He was buried in Leysin cemetery and is memorialized by a stone plinth outside the post office in Currie.<br>
