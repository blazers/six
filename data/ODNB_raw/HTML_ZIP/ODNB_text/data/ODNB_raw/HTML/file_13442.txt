<span class="headword">Hodgson,  John Studholme</span>  (1805&#150;1870), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Blake Street, York, on 24 April 1805, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13440/', "General John Hodgson (1757&#150;1846)")</script> and his wife, Catherine Krempion of St Petersburg. Hodgson entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1821, was commissioned ensign in the 23rd Bengal native infantry on 3 February 1822, and arrived in India on 12 July the same year. On 1 May 1824 he became lieutenant in the 12th regiment, and was promoted captain on 21 June 1834.<br>
<br>Hodgson was on sick leave from the effects of numerous tiger wounds when the First Anglo-Sikh War broke out in December 1845, but he was determined to join his regiment. Finding the communications interrupted, he walked 30 miles, narrowly escaping attack from the enemy. He served throughout the campaign of 1845&#150;6, and was present at the battle of Sobraon, where he was wounded. He was made brevet major on 9 November 1846, and was selected to raise the first Sikh regiment embodied in the British service. On 14 December 1846 he was made commandant of the 1st Sikh infantry, and commanded it in the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848&#150;9), a task of peculiar difficulty, which he performed with notable success. Among other conspicuous services he led the attack upon the raja of Juswan Dun on the night of 2 December 1848, and took and destroyed the fort of Ukrot. For this action he was specially commended, and received the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel on 7 June 1849.<br>
<br>On 29 October 1850 Hodgson was selected as commandant of the Punjab irregular force, in which post he served until July 1854. In 1853 he successfully directed military operations against the hill peoples west of the Derajat. While in command of the Derajat frontier he was chosen to succeed Sir Colin Campbell in command of the Peshawar frontier. He was promoted major on 28 August 1853, brevet colonel on 28 November 1854, lieutenant-colonel on 25 April 1858, colonel of the 12th native infantry on 24 July 1858, and major-general on 23 July 1861. He published his <span class="italic">Musing on Military Matters</span> in 1851 and his <span class="italic">Opinions on the Indian Army</span> in 1857. In 1865 Hodgson retired from active service, and settled in London. He died at his home, 10 Stanhope Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 14 January 1870.<br>
