<span class="headword">Pinchbeck family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1720&#150;1783), <span class="occ">clockmakers and mechanics</span>, came to prominence through the invention of &#145;pinchbeck&#146;, a copper and zinc alloy having the appearance of gold, by <a name="cosubject_22286"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Pinchbeck</span>  (1669/70&#150;1732)<span class="occ"></span>. His parentage and date of birth are obscure; though no records have been found, it seems that he was first apprenticed to a fisherman and later to a pastry cook. Nor is it known where he learned the skills which enabled him to set up as a maker of clocks and automata, trading from St George's Court, Clerkenwell. In 1721 he moved to Fleet Street, where, under the sign of the Astronomico-Musical Clock, &#145;he maketh and selleth watches of all sorts, and clocks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Applebee's Weekly Journal</span>). Mention is also made of musical automata, in imitation of singing birds, and of barrel organs for churches. Apparently he also leased the pastry shop next door which he ran with his wife, Rossomon. Their date of marriage is unknown. She predeceased him but their two eldest sons, <a href="#cosubject_22287">Christopher</a> and <a href="#cosubject_22288">Edward [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and three other children, John, George, and Rosamond, were living at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Pinchbeck exhibited his astronomical clocks at Bartholomew fair in association with a juggler named Isaac Fawkes under the style of the &#145;Temple of the Muses&#146;, &#145;Grand Theatre of the Muses&#146;, or &#145;Multum in Parvo&#146;. The <span class="italic">Daily Journal</span> of 27 August 1729 announced that the prince and princess of Wales went to the fair to see these marvels. A large broadside relating to the exhibits, with the place and date left blank, implies that they were toured, as does a print showing a fair with &#145;Pinchbeck&#146; over one of the booths. His clocks are referred to in George Vertue's <span class="italic">Diary</span> for 1732 and he is known to have made and sold trinkets of pinchbeck.<br>
<br>Christopher Pinchbeck died on 18 November 1732 aged sixty-two and was buried on 21 November in St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street. In his will, written the previous week, he appointed Edward Pinchbeck as his sole executor, Christopher being at this time in France. The estate was to be equally divided among his five children.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22288"></a><span class="headword">Edward Pinchbeck</span>  (1713?&#150;1766?)<span class="occ"></span> took over the running of his father's business, his sign now that of the Musical Clock. His wife, Alice, was already expecting Christopher, the first of their two sons. Edward immediately began to advertise the alloy, stating, in the <span class="italic">Daily Post</span> of 27 November 1732, that &#145;the toys made of the late ingenious Mr Pinchbeck's curious metal &hellip; are now sold only by his son and sole executor, Mr Edward Pinchbeck&#146;. He also declared that he could reduce watches &#145;to a fashionable Size, by a new Method, without altering the Works&#146;. His failure to comply with the instructions in the will to divide the estate equally caused a family confrontation. He claimed that there were insufficient assets for any inheritance to be met and that his &#145;new and improved alloy&#146;, and not that of his father, was the only asset in the business. His brother Christopher took the matter to the law courts. No contemporary records detailing the composition of either metal have been found. Zinc was rare at the time, being imported from the Far East, but various alloys of copper and zinc, often adulterated with other trace metals, were available in Germany.<br>
<br>Edward Pinchbeck's trade card, published after his successful lawsuit, advertised that he made and repaired astronomical, musical, and repeating clocks, watches, &#145;Musical-machines and Machinery of any kind whatsoever&#146;. In 1733 he exhibited under title the &#145;Grand Theatre of the Muses&#146; at Bartholomew fair. In 1745 he took premises in Edinburgh, advertising in the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span> of 14 January 1745 &#145;anything in his metal that is made either in Gold or Silver&#146;. By May he returned home, possibly owing to his wife's illness which led to her death later that year. The insurance value of his goods, utensils, and stock-in-trade was &pound;300 in 1755. He continued to trade in Fleet Street until 1758 but his whereabouts thereafter is uncertain and a date of death of 1766, suggested by some writers, has not been documented.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22287"></a><span class="headword">Christopher Pinchbeck</span>  (1709/10&#150;1783)<span class="occ"></span>, Edward's older brother, took premises a few doors from those of their late father. Under the sign of Pinchbeck's Head he sold trinkets in pinchbeck metal, and clocks and watches. His trade card for 1747 indicated that he had moved to Cockspur Street, Westminster, with additional premises at Tunbridge Wells. He chose not to frequent the London fairs with his &#145;mechanical wonders&#146; but in 1766 opened a &#145;repository&#146; above his shop where he showed among twenty other marvels a triangular musical machine called the panopticon. He was held in considerable esteem by George III, and Wilkes included him in a &#145;list of the party who call themselves the King's Friends&#146; and also as a member of the &#145;Buckingham House Cabinet&#146;  (Wilkes, <span class="italic">London Museum</span>, 2.33). He took out two patents in 1768, one for a &#145;nocturnal remembrancer&#146;, or writing tablet which could be used in the dark, another for a candlestick incorporating a device to keep the candle upright, and in 1776 one for a design for candle-snuffers that continued in use into the twentieth century. This inspired an &#145;Ode to Mr Pinchbeck, upon his newly-invented candle snuffers&#146; by &#145;Malcolm MacGregor&#146;, the pseudonym of William Mason, a leading satirist of the day and an ardent whig who took the opportunity to indulge in political mockery. Pinchbeck was appointed king's clockmaker and was made an honorary freeman of the Clockmakers' Company in 1781. It seems probable that he did not make clock movements himself but employed others to work to his designs. He undoubtedly possessed great mechanical ingenuity. It is probably he, rather than his father, who is mentioned in 1731 as acting as technical expert to the London Lead Company on two occasions, regarding the feasibility of using &#145;fire engines&#146; for draining two lead mines in Flintshire. He was elected to the Smeatonian Society in 1774 and held office as president for the year 1781&#150;2. He was a member of the Society of Arts from its inception in 1757. In 1762 he devised a self-acting pneumatic brake for preventing accidents to the men employed on walking cranes, for which the society awarded him a gold medal. In 1774 he presented a model of a plough for mending roads to the society.<br>
<br>Christopher Pinchbeck purchased land near Tunbridge Wells on which lay Adam's Well, which on analysis was shown to lack any of the beneficial minerals associated with the town's famous spa waters. Seeking to turn this deficit to his advantage, he proclaimed its purity and invested a considerable sum in digging baths and constructing buildings and an approach road. He sold bottles of the water there, in the assembly room he leased in the town, and in London. The project was, however, a costly disaster which he wryly referred to as &#145;Pinchbeck's folly&#146;.<br>
<br>Details of Christopher's wife, Martha, are unknown; she presumably predeceased him, for his will, dated 1779, mentions his married daughters Martha and Rosamond and his son William, for whom &#145;I do desire and direct that one guinea per week be paid to my undutifull and afflicting son Will Pinchbeck (whom I am unhappy to say has never done one single thing to oblige me since his infancy)&#146;. The will further discloses that Christopher was at the time litigating for William and his family in regard to a freehold estate. Christopher died on 17 March 1783, aged seventy-three, and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. His son-in-law William Hebb, tobacconist and snuffman, whose premises were next door to Christopher's in Cockspur Street, continued his business until February 1788 when, intending to move his own premises, he put the remaining stock up for disposal at John Christie's auction rooms in King Street. The sale lasted two days, the 211 lots fetching in the region of &pound;75.<br>
