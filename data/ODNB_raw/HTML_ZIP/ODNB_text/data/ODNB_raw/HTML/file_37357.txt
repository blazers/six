<span class="headword">Diaper,  William</span>  (1685&#150;1717), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Bridgwater, Somerset, the son of Joseph Diaper. Nothing else is known of his family or early life. In his poetry he describes himself as &#145;one bred up in homely Cott&#146;. He matriculated on 3 April 1699 at Oxford, where he studied at Balliol College as &#145;pauper puer&#146;. He graduated BA in 1702, and remained as a scholar until 1705. His name reappears in the college books in 1710 as a BA commoner.<br>
<br>Diaper was ordained deacon in Wells on 19 June 1709, and served subsequently as curate in Brent in the same diocese. This appointment may not have been entirely happy. His stark but also amusing topographical poem &#145;Brent&#146; describes the place as &#145;nature's gaol&#146;, where winter flooding leaves its inhabitants isolated with scant food and &#145;unwholesome ale&#146;. Diaper may have taken another cure in Crick, Northamptonshire, and by March 1714 was serving in Dean, near Basingstoke.<br>
<br>As a poet Diaper made his mark first in 1712 with the publication of <span class="italic">Nereides, or, Sea-Eclogues</span>, <span class="italic">Callipaedia</span>, and <span class="italic">Dryades</span>. He came to the attention of Jonathan Swift, who wrote:<blockquote>I have contrivd to make a Parson of him; for he is half a one already, being in Deacon's Orders, and serves a small Cure in the Country, but has a sword at his A[rse] here in Town. Tis a poor little short Wretch, but will do best in a Gown. (Swift, <span class="italic">Journal</span>, 586)</blockquote>Swift introduced Diaper to his circle where he was taken up by Henry St John, first Viscount Bolingbroke, and Sir William Wyndham. On 13 February 1713 Swift speaks of him &#145;in a nasty Garret, very sick&#146;. On this occasion Swift brought him a gift of &pound;20 from Bolingbroke. Swift was soon appointed dean of St Patrick's in Dublin, though he assured Diaper: &#145;I will move Heaven and Earth that something may be done for you&#146;. In the same letter he advised Diaper to control his extravagant similes, and write more like a mortal man  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Jonathan Swift</span>, 346). Swift could do little, however, to relieve Diaper's poverty, and following the death of Queen Anne his other patrons were deprived of influence.<br>
<br>Diaper published <span class="italic">An Imitation of the Seventeenth Epistle of the First Book of Horace</span> in 1714, and addressed the poem to Swift. His last literary project, <span class="italic">Halieuticks</span>, was a verse translation of Oppian, of which he completed two books, published posthumously (1722). Diaper's best poetry is contained in <span class="italic">Nereides</span> and the translation of Oppian, where his descriptions of the ocean and of aquatic life are startling and individual.<br>
<br>There is an unconfirmed suggestion that Diaper was ordained priest in 1715. By May 1716, however, he was again ill. He died some time in 1717, though neither the date nor location is recorded.<br>
