<span class="headword">Mellish <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>da Costa; <em>other married name </em>Villareal]</span>,  Catherine Rachel <span class="st"> [Kitty; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>known as </em>Kitty  da Costa Villareal]</span>  (1710&#150;1747), <span class="occ">breach of promise defendant</span>, was born in London in the summer of 1710, probably in the Budge Row house of her paternal grandfather, Alvaro da Costa. She was the eldest child of Joseph da Costa (1683&#150;1753), a rich Anglo-Jewish merchant, trader, and financier, and of his wife and first cousin, Leonora Sara Mendes (<i>d</i>. 1767). Kitty was brought up in Budge Row and also, from about 1722, in her father's much admired mansion, Copped Hall, Totteridge, Hertfordshire. Her upbringing was that of a rich and well-educated English lady.<br>
<br>About 1724 a match was mooted between a willing Kitty and her eager first cousin, Philip Jacob Mendes da Costa (1708&#150;1780), but the young man was unacceptable to Kitty's parents on moral grounds. On 24 May 1727 the reluctant Kitty, &#145;at the age of almost seventeen&#146;  (&#145;Proceedings&#146;), married the wealthy but 54-year-old Joseph Isaac Villareal (1673&#150;1730), son of the former comptroller-general of the armies of the king of Portugal, who with his family had arrived in London in 1726, fleeing Lisbon to escape charges of Judaizing. Kitty and Joseph had two children, Sarah and Abraham, born on 10 June 1728 and 15 May 1729. On 27 December 1730 Joseph Villareal died leaving Kitty, at twenty, a rich, beautiful, and by no means inconsolable widow.<br>
<br>Only three weeks after her husband's death the seemingly besotted Kitty was promising to marry her former suitor as soon as her year of mourning was ended. Love-tokens of a ring and a miniature were exchanged; indiscreet assignations took place in Kitty's own house in College Hill in the City of London; Philip's letters to Kitty were pressing, Kitty's to him passionate, and virulent about alleged machinations on the part of members of her family to gain control of her fortune. There was an abortive elopement from Copped Hall, and a feigned illness on her part designed to persuade her father to accept Philip. But eventually Philip, probably a libertine and certainly a fortune-hunter, was sent packing. Furious, he ill-advisedly sued Kitty for breach of promise in the ecclesiastical court of arches on 11 January 1732 (the first time a Jew had done such a thing), demanding fulfilment of the alleged contract or damages of &pound;100,000. On 25 June 1733 judgment went against him on the grounds that Kitty's promise of marriage had not been absolute but conditional on her father's consent. In February 1734 Philip brought a civil suit in the court of king's bench for damages, but lost it on the same grounds as before. Later that year he published an embittered and venomous account of the court of arches proceedings, bringing additional shame on the Sephardi community.<br>
<br>Kitty, by no means blameless and undoubtedly headstrong, finally broke with her family and Judaism on 27 February 1735 by marrying a Christian, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48028/', "William Mellish (c.1710&#150;1791)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48030/', "Mellish, William (1764&#150;1838)")</script>], of Blyth, Nottinghamshire, the younger son of a good local family who had made their fortune in trade with Turkey and Portugal. William was a barrister, educated at Eton and at Cambridge. A month after the wedding Kitty was baptized at St George's, Bloomsbury. Her children from her first marriage, by agreement under the tutelage of her father, were returned to her after a protracted legal battle and also baptized, as Elizabeth and William, on 11 April 1738 at St Anne's, Soho. Kitty and William Mellish had one surviving son, Charles, born on 16 July 1737, who became recorder of Newark, and an MP in 1774, only the second man of Jewish blood to enter parliament. Elizabeth married the future second Viscount Galway in 1747 and thus became the first person of Jewish birth to marry into the peerage. Her brother, William, married the sister of a future English bishop. Possibly with the help of his wife's fortune, William Mellish himself had been returned to parliament as member for Retford from 1741 to 1751, and then became commissioner of excise, then receiver-general of customs. Kitty's younger brother, Benjamin (1712&#150;1782), also converted to Christianity and married a gentile.<br>
<br>Kitty died, still young, at Blyth on 19 March 1747, and was buried on 27 March at Blyth church, leaving her entire estate to her &#145;dear and loving husband&#146;. She and her kin were striking early examples of defection or drift from Judaism by Anglo-Jews and of assimilation into mainstream English society.<br>
