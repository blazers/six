<span class="headword">Shortland,  Peter Frederick</span>  (1815&#150;1888), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 15 November 1815, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25467/', "Captain Thomas George Shortland RN (1771&#150;1827)")</script> and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tonkin. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25468/', "Willoughby Shortland")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25464/', "Edward Shortland")</script>. He entered the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in January 1827, and, having passed with distinction, served afloat until 1834, when, on 4 December, he passed the examination for lieutenant. In 1836&#150;8 he was a mate on the <i>Rattlesnake</i> in Australian waters, and, on the settlement of Melbourne, made a survey of Port Phillip. After returning to England in 1838 he obtained leave, matriculated at Cambridge as a member of Pembroke College, and in 1842 graduated seventh wrangler. He then applied to join the <i>Excellent</i> to compete for the commission at that time offered as a prize to young officers passing a course of gunnery and mathematics; but, as the advent of a seventh wrangler seemed likely to kill all competition, the Admiralty promoted him at once, on 1 April 1842. He was then appointed to the steamer <i>Columbia</i> for surveying duties on the coast of North America.<br>
<br>Soon after arriving on station Shortland succeeded to the command. In 1848 he married Emily Marilin, the daughter of Captain Thomas Jones of the 74th regiment; they had children. As lieutenant, as commander (20 January 1848), and as captain (1 January 1859) Shortland continued on the same station until 1865, making a complete survey of the coast of Nova Scotia, including the Bay of Fundy, for which he was specially thanked by the Admiralty. He was then appointed to the <i>Hydra</i> for surveying service in the Mediterranean, but in 1867 was sent to the East Indies to take a line of deep-sea soundings from Aden to Bombay. The <i>Hydra</i> was paid off in 1868, and Shortland, at the request of the Admiralty, wrote an account of the operation in <span class="italic">A Sounding Voyage of HMS Hydra</span> (1868). On attaining the age of fifty-five in 1870 he was placed on the retired list. He then qualified as a barrister and on 27 January 1873 was called to the bar; he practised in the Admiralty court. He became rear-admiral on 21 September 1876 and vice-admiral on 3 January 1881. He was the author of <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Laws which Govern HM Navy</span> (1886) and of <span class="italic">Nautical Surveying</span> (1890), published posthumously. He died at his home, 6 Hoe Villas, Plymouth, on 18 October 1888, survived by his wife.<br>
