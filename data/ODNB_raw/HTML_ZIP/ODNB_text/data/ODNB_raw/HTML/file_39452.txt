<span class="headword">Flower,  Charles Edward</span>  (1830&#150;1892), <span class="occ">brewer and benefactor</span>, was born on 3 February 1830 at 2 Payton Street, Stratford upon Avon, the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9761/', "Edward Fordham Flower (1805&#150;1883)")</script> and his wife, Selina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greaves (<i>d</i>. 1884). Educated first by governesses and briefly at the free school in Stratford, he was sent to Edgbaston preparatory school, returning to Stratford when his master, John Atkinson, was transferred to the King Edward VI School. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9766/', "Sir William Henry Flower")</script>, the eminent zoologist, was his brother.<br>
<br>In June 1845 Flower entered the family brewing firm in Stratford, where he learned all aspects of the trade. In October 1846, while his father travelled for six months in America, he managed the Flower brewery, of which he was made a partner in 1852. Marrying Sarah, youngest daughter of Peter Martineau of Islington, on 13 May the same year, he moved to London and for a year managed the export trade of the newly named Flower &amp; Son brewery from a small store in James Street, Adelphi, before returning to Stratford, where he and his wife lived at the brewery. In 1867 he built Avonbank, their home for the remainder of their lives.<br>
<br>On his father's retirement in 1863 Flower became head of Flower &amp; Sons and with his brother, Edgar, modernized and expanded the enterprise. In 1870 a new brewery, incorporating the latest brewing technology, was built and oriented to rail, rather than water transport. In 1888 the firm became a limited liability company, whereupon Charles resigned his active involvement with the business, nevertheless remaining a brewery director and active in Stratford.<br>
<br>Besides having been one of the founders of the Stratford Volunteers, together with his father Flower organized the Stratford Tercentenary in 1864. His greatest achievement, however, was establishing the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, which was begun in 1879 on land donated by him. Despite constant criticism, the project, which included a gallery and a library, was completed in 1883, funded primarily by Flower. An interest in Shakespeare also led him to contribute to the literature concerning the playwright. In <span class="italic">Shakespeare on Horseback</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">Shakespeare No Dog Fancier</span> (1890), Flower discusses the bard's knowledge of horses and dogs as expressed in his plays. His only other publication, <span class="italic">Algerian Hints for Tourists</span>, was compiled in 1889 after visiting Algiers, and served as a guidebook for many years.<br>
<br>Although a passion for travel took him to remote destinations, including America and Africa, Flower travelled less in his later years. In 1875 he purchased an estate of 11,000 acres at Glencassley in Sutherland, of which county he became a JP. Although he frequently visited his property in Scotland, his other civic duties kept him rooted in Stratford.<br>
<br>His leading role in Stratford involved Flower in many committees and led him to undertake numerous civic and public duties. He served on the town council from 1876 to 1888, and was mayor from 1878 to 1880. He was chairman of the land and buildings committee, the Birthplace Trust executive committee and the records committee which, under his leadership, arranged for the conservation of the hitherto neglected town records. He was a JP for Warwickshire, and for Stratford upon Avon. He was a governor of the Edward VI School, and funded its restoration in 1892. After retiring from the town council, Flower was elected to the Warwickshire county council, on which he served until 3 May 1892, dying of apoplexy during one of their meetings at the court house, Warwick; he was buried four days later at the cemetery, Evesham Road, Stratford upon Avon.<br>
<br>In his will Flower left a bequest to the Memorial Theatre Fund and the Edward VI School, the latter of which was used to establish a scholarship. He also generously supported his nieces and nephews, as well as brewery managers. Having no children of his own, Flower bequeathed nearly his entire estate to his wife. On her death on 21 July 1908 it was distributed among family members and the various hospitals, committees, and organizations which they had supported throughout their lives.<br>
