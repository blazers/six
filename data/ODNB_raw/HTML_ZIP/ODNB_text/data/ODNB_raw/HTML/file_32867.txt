<span class="headword">Wylie,  Charles Hotham Montagu  Doughty-</span>  (1868&#150;1915), <span class="occ">army officer and consul</span>, was born on 23 July 1868 at Theberton Hall, near Leiston, Suffolk, the son of Henry Montagu Doughty (1841&#150;1916), lord of the manor of Theberton, a former naval officer who had been called to the bar in 1863, and his wife, Edith Rebecca Cameron, daughter of the chief justice of Vancouver. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32866/', "Charles Montagu Doughty (1843&#150;1926)")</script>, the celebrated Arabian explorer, was his uncle. Edith Doughty died on 4 September 1870 after giving birth to another son, Henry Montagu Doughty. Charles Doughty was educated at Winchester College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before being commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 21 September 1889.<br>
<br>The late-Victorian army offered numerous opportunities of combat experience not only in small colonial &#145;brush fire&#146; wars but also in wider conflicts. Doughty took his fill. The first fifteen years of his military service involved him in one military campaign after another: the Hazara expedition (1891); Chitral (1895); Crete (1896); the Sudan (1898&#150;9); southern Africa (1900); Tientsin (Tianjin) (1900); and Somaliland (1903&#150;4). His military service was not only intense but also varied, involving service on the north-west frontier of India, east and southern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Far East. At Chitral he held the key post of transport officer on the staff of Sir William Gatacre. His posting to the British garrison on Crete during the tumultuous period of civil unrest that resulted in the removal of the Turkish presence on the island (November 1898) brought him into contact for the first time with the Ottoman empire, an involvement destined to become a central part of his life and career. In the Sudan he was a brigade major. In southern Africa and China he commanded mounted infantry, in Somaliland a detachment of the Somali camel corps. He was wounded twice, in the Hazara expedition and in southern Africa.<br>
<br>In May 1904, while on leave in Bombay, Doughty finally found the time to marry. His bride was Lilian Oimara Adams (<i>d</i>. 1960), widow of Lieutenant Henry Adams (<i>d</i>. 1900) of the Indian Medical Service, and daughter of John Wylie, of West Cliffe Hall, Hampshire. They had no children. In December 1904 Charles Doughty added his wife's maiden name to his own by deed poll, becoming Doughty-Wylie. He was described as &#145;Tall and slightly though vigorously built&#146;, with a &#145;fair complexion and keen blue eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). &#145;He was an ardent sportsman, good rider and good shot &hellip; but he always retained the literary interests of a Winchester scholar. Simple, tenacious, chivalrous, and humorous, he quickly won sympathy and obedience, and was a born leader of fighting men&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>After almost twenty years of soldiering Doughty-Wylie's career changed tack. The late-Victorian and Edwardian army also offered opportunity of political employment and in September 1906 he became British military vice-consul in the Turkish province of Konia. This appointment, in an apparent backwater, provided little respite from Doughty-Wylie's life of action. On the contrary it brought him international acclaim. The Ottoman empire was in the throes of change, during which the Armenian minority often became the victims of violence. At Adana in 1909 Doughty-Wylie displayed outstanding courage and leadership by taking command of a group of Turkish regular troops and preventing a massacre, being wounded for the third time. He was portrayed as a defender of Christianity against Islam. His actions touched a raw nerve among the Western imperialist nations, aware of the potential vulnerability of their small governing &eacute;lites, surrounded by millions of &#145;non-believers&#146;. Doughty-Wylie's time in Turkey also complicated his personal life. Here, in 1907, he met the archaeologist Gertrude Bell (1868&#150;1926), with whom he began an intimate correspondence. In August 1913, following a visit to the Bell family home, Rounton Grange in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the two became lovers. Their relationship remained a secret outside the Bell family and Doughty-Wylie's letters to Gertrude did not become publicly available until after his wife's death in 1960.<br>
<br>Doughty-Wylie's achievements at Adana were rewarded by promotion to consul-general at Addis Ababa in Abyssinia. He served there for three years, until 1912, when he became chief director of the Red Cross on the Turkish side in the First Balkan War, a role in which he won the considerable respect and affection of the Turks. His wife, who was to develop her own distinguished career in military nursing, accompanied him to Constantinople as superintendent of nursing staff. The trust that Doughty-Wylie had established with the Turkish authorities made him an excellent choice as chairman of the commission that arbitrated the Greek&#150;Albanian frontier in the wake of the Second Balkan War. He returned to Addis Ababa in 1913.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war between Great Britain and Turkey in October 1914 changed everything for Doughty-Wylie. A man of his spirit and ambition had to be involved. His experience and knowledge of the Ottoman empire were also at a premium. This was recognized by General Sir John Maxwell, commander-in-chief, Egypt, who intercepted Doughty-Wylie in Cairo <i>en route</i> for London in search of military employment. In February 1915 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel and joined the staff of General Sir Ian Hamilton, commander designate of the Mediterranean expeditionary force, shortly to be charged with launching an ambitious and risky amphibious assault on the Gallipoli peninsula. On 25 April 1915, the day of the attack, Doughty-Wylie was on the converted collier SS <i>River Clyde</i>, off V Beach where it had landed troops under a murderous Turkish fire and with terrible loss. Aware of the desperate situation on the beach, Doughty-Wylie volunteered to go ashore after nightfall and assess the situation. The following morning he returned to the beach, together with his fellow staff officer Captain G. N. Walford, and took command. Recognizing the urgency of getting the men off the beach, he collected the remnants of three battalions, 2nd Hampshires, 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers, and 1st Royal Munster Fusiliers, and led them in a successful attack on the old fort which commanded the approaches to the village of Sedd-el-Bahr. Doughty-Wylie personally led the charge that captured the village following the death of Walford. He then considered how best to capture hill 141, the feature that commanded the beach. He returned to the shore to arrange a naval bombardment of the position by the 15-inch guns of the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>. The infantry assault went in immediately after the bombardment ceased, about two o'clock in the afternoon, led by Doughty-Wylie, who was armed only with a cane, not wishing to bear arms against his former friends. Hill 141 was a tough obstacle, protected by barbed wire entanglements, its summit crowned by a redoubt, surrounded by a deep moat, but the charge carried the day. On 26 April Doughty-Wylie's leadership, energy, determination, tactical awareness, and complete disregard for his own safety had succeeded in transforming the dispirited remnants of the landing force and in securing the beach. At the moment of victory, Doughty-Wylie was struck just below the eye by a bullet that blew away the side of his face. He died instantly and was buried where he lay. His grave remains the only individual one on the peninsula, flanked by trees at the summit of the hill renamed Fort Doughty-Wylie in his honour. Doughty-Wylie was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. He was the highest ranking officer to win the award during the Gallipoli campaign.<br>
