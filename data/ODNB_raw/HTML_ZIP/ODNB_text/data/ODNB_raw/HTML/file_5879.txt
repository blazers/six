<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Derwent</span>  (1800&#150;1883), <span class="occ">writer and educationist</span>, was born on 14 September 1800 at Greta Hall, Keswick, Cumberland, the second of the three surviving children of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5888/', "Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772&#150;1834)")</script> and his wife, Sara (1770&#150;1845), daughter of Stephen Fricker of Bristol. From early childhood he showed the sturdy independence and dogged determination which characterized his life. After attending Keswick day school he was educated at the Revd John Dawes's school at Ambleside and spent his weekends with the Wordsworth family. For three years he was a private tutor in Lancashire and then in 1820 went to St John's College, Cambridge. Through the friendship of his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5882/', "Henry Nelson Coleridge (1798&#150;1843)")</script> he was drawn into a brilliant circle which included Thomas Babington Macaulay, the poets Chauncey Hare Townsend and Sidney Walker, Winthrop Praed, and John Moultrie, the future vicar of Rugby who became his lifelong friend. (Much later, in 1864 and 1876, Derwent Coleridge edited the poems of Praed and Moultrie and wrote memoirs of them.) He joined his contemporaries in writing for <span class="italic">Knight's Quarterly</span>, contributing under the pseudonym Davenant Cecil mostly rather second-rate love poems. He was never happy as a creative writer, but his incisive intellect and organizational skills made him a natural critic and editor, as the lucid approachability of his later work testifies. He was also an accomplished linguist: in addition to the usual European languages he also knew Zulu, Arabic, Hawaiian, Hungarian, and Welsh.<br>
<br>Derwent Coleridge's eventual pass degree at Cambridge does not deny his brilliance but reflects the misery of his final year, which began with a bout of typhus fever and continued with debt and confusion. Both he and Moultrie had lost their orthodox faith, but that autumn Moultrie regained his, leaving Coleridge feeling spiritually betrayed. Debt, caused by moving in wealthy circles on a frugal allowance, seemed about to be alleviated by two exhibitions, but he did not receive the money for months. He resented his father's failure to provide for him financially, while at the same time criticizing his debts. Throughout his life he was publicly loyal to his father. In private, however, he was angered by his hypocrisy and weakness, and the inherent dependence of his children on others. Sensitive and independent, he found intolerable the constant need to be overtly grateful. In 1823 he deliberately cast himself off from his family, until he could return from a new position of strength and identity. He moved to the west country, becoming third master at the proprietary school at Plymouth.<br>
<br>Derwent Coleridge became involved in the intellectual life of the city, including lecturing at the Athenaeum. His talk on Wordsworth was published by the <span class="italic">Metropolitan Quarterly</span> in 1826. In Plymouth he met Mary Simpson Pridham (1807&#150;1887), whom he married on 6 December 1827. His love for her gave purpose to his life again and made him receptive to a profound reaffirmation of faith. In January 1826 he returned to Cambridge to read for an MA in divinity. He was fully ordained on 15 July 1827, and accepted the living of Helston in Cornwall, which had a school attached. He transformed the school into a thriving concern which produced excellent examination results. He designed a new school building and had it erected. Architecture was a lifelong fascination. He believed that a suitable environment was essential for successful work. In each of his subsequent positions he was to instigate a major rebuilding programme.<br>
<br>In 1839 Derwent Coleridge's book <span class="italic">The Scriptural Character of the English Church</span> was published. It was a way of trying to clarify his beliefs in the light of his own reconversion and also in the climate of religious debate fuelled by the Oxford Movement and the dissident low churches. He writes of the threat of these divisions and appeals for a broad approach, stressing the impossibility of applying earthly theories and systems to the universal, timeless nature of God.<br>
<br>On 3 February 1841 Derwent Coleridge was appointed principal of St Mark's College, newly established in Chelsea, London, as the very first teacher training college. Over the next twenty years he did much to shape the course of education. His annual reports reveal the all-encompassing nature of the community he headed. The students were given a thorough education ranging from academic subjects to music, carpentry, and bookkeeping. They also worked on the college farm and in the house, which encouraged a sense of duty and humility and made them practically acquainted with the work and conditions of the poor among whom many of them would be placed. The theory of teaching was constantly reinforced by work in a real school within the college, which also benefited the poor children of the local community. Coleridge was convinced that the church should be on the front line of social change and the way was through education. He saw the daily choral service in the college chapel as the moral foundation of the college, but this too, like the education of the very poor, was attacked as excessive. In 1861 there was a public outcry against the government's revised education code. Among the many pamphlets published were Derwent Coleridge's <span class="italic">The Education of the People</span> and <span class="italic">The Teachers of the People</span>. The revised code overturned everything he had worked for in its plans for private rather than public funding, &#145;payment by results&#146;, and the reduction of grants for teacher training.<br>
<br>On the death of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5880/', "(David) Hartley Coleridge (1796&#150;1849)")</script> Derwent Coleridge collected, edited, and published his work, adding a moving and perceptive memoir (1851). After the death of his sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5889/', "Sara Coleridge (1802&#150;1852)")</script> he carried on her editorship of their father's works. In 1864 he became rector of Hanwell, Middlesex, where his last great project was the building of a new church. At the age of eighty he retired to Torquay, where he died on 28 March 1883; he was survived by his wife. During his last years he enjoyed the companionship of his children. The eldest, Derwent Moultrie, had been sent to Australia and had died there in 1881, but Ernest and Christabel Rose Coleridge remained close to him.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_55566"></a><span class="headword">Christabel Rose Coleridge</span>  (1843&#150;1921), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 25 May 1843 at St Mark's College, Chelsea, London, the second of Derwent Coleridge's three surviving children. As a young woman she helped in her brother Ernest's school, but she wished to be a writer and subsequently had at least fifteen novels published, including <span class="italic">Lady Betty</span> (1869), <span class="italic">An English Squire</span> (1881), <span class="italic">A Near Relation</span> (1886), and <span class="italic">The Prophet's Mantle</span> (1897). Many of her works were published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. From 1890 she helped to edit the magazines the <span class="italic">Monthly Packet</span> and <span class="italic">Friendly Leaves</span>. Christabel held conservative views on &#145;the woman question&#146; and produced <span class="italic">The Daughters who have not Revolted</span>, a collection of essays, in 1894. She was a close friend of her distant cousin, the novelist Charlotte Mary Yonge, and they collaborated in the writing of <span class="italic">Strolling Players</span> (1893). After Charlotte's death in 1901 Christabel published <span class="italic">Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters</span> (1903), an authoritative arrangement of autobiographical and bibliographical material, interleaved with letters and comment. She died, unmarried, on 14 November 1921 at Cheyne, Bridge Road, Torquay, Devon.<br>
