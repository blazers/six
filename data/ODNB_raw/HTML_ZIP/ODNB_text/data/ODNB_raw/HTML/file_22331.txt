<span class="headword">Pitt,  Moses</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1639, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">bookseller and printer</span>, was baptized at St Teath in Cornwall on 12 March 1639, the son of John Pitt, yeoman, and Joan (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Mill). Pitt was educated locally and retained his personal links with the west of England throughout his life. His last publication describing the experiences of his nurse Ann Jefferies, who was said to have been visited by fairies and fed by them while in Bodmin gaol, contains a number of asides about his childhood on the large family farm. Pitt's younger sister Mary claimed to have seen the fairies but he did not. In 1654 he was apprenticed to the London bookseller Robert Littlebury, a freeman of the Haberdashers' Company. Pitt also took up his freedom with the Haberdashers in 1661 but unlike his first cousin, the paper merchant and publisher Adiel Mill, he never transferred to the more appropriate Stationers' Company. The first books to carry Pitt's name on the imprint were published from the White Hart in Little Britain, London, in 1667. They were characteristically learned publications, one of continental origin, and such material remained the hallmark of his business. After the great fire (1666) several of the heavy hitters of the London book trade moved into the neighbourhood and it may have been in this way that Pitt began to develop an effective network of contacts within the intellectual environment of print. His honesty and capacity for learning probably helped. According to the bookseller John Dunton, &#145;his wit and virtues were writ legibly in his face &hellip; and he had a great deal of sweetness in his natural temper&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>On 3 July 1668 Pitt was married in London at St Luke's, Chelsea, to Mary Upman, sister of the Revd Stephen Upman, later elected a prebend of Westminster Abbey (1691). By the early 1670s Pitt was trading from the Angel in St Paul's Churchyard and was printing and publishing the work of members of the Royal Society, including Robert Boyle, and of such high flyers in the Church of England as Gilbert Burnet. Pitt was also importing books, and in 1678 became one of the first in the trade to sell books by auction. He used premises in Little Britain for the purpose.<br>
<br>For Pitt 1678 was a critical year. In May, with the support of several of the leading members of the Royal Society, including Christopher Wren, he issued proposals for a huge twelve-volume <span class="italic">Atlas</span> of the world. It was to be based on the plates cut for Janssen with a text partly attributed to Bishop William Nicholson and Richard Peers. Only four volumes were published. In September, Pitt signed a three-year lease on the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, with three other members of the London trade, including Thomas Guy, partly for use in printing the <span class="italic">Atlas</span>. In the same year Pitt's relative Richard Mill died and named him as his executor, putting him in control of a valuable set of leases, notably the Blue-Boar's Head estate in Westminster. Pitt soon began to set about rationalizing his complex financial and business interests. His work as printer and publisher was increasingly focused on the <span class="italic">Atlas</span> though he continued to undertake work for the Royal Society, appearing on the imprint of its <span class="italic">Transactions</span> in 1683. At the same time he embarked on an extensive programme of building and improvement in Westminster. In 1685 he began to sell off his stock of books at auction and about the same time moved into one of his own houses in Duke Street, Westminster. However, in almost every area things were beginning to go wrong for Pitt. The <span class="italic">Atlas</span> was becoming bogged down in rising costs estimated by Pitt at about &pound;1000 per volume. Relations with his Oxford partners broke down and led to his arrest and the seizure of his property. This, the massive outlay on the Westminster estate, which he reckoned at nearly &pound;19,000, and his belief in family values, initiated his final downfall. In June 1684 he entered into a statute staple with his cousin and creditor Adiel Mill and began to hand over all his assets in money, books, and property to Mill partly to avoid confiscation under any action of bankruptcy. Pitt's problems were compounded in the late 1680s when he became involved in a property deal with Chief Justice Jeffreys. In the middle of some intricate negotiations the removal of James II and the arrest of Jeffreys dealt a serious blow to Pitt's interests. With Mill refusing to return his assets and pursuing him for debt, Pitt was arrested in April 1689 at the suit of a bricklayer. &#145;Two days later&#146;, he wrote, &#145;I removed my self to the <i>Fleet Prison</i>&#146; and he remained a prisoner for debt there and subsequently in the king's bench for at least seven years. Soon after his arrest he was declared bankrupt. Pitt did not go quietly. In 1691 he published <span class="italic">The Cry of the Oppressed</span> in which, as well as a stirring appeal on behalf of all prisoners for debt across the nation, he included a statement of his own &#145;Case&#146;, laying out in sometimes confusing detail the circumstances of his personal tragedy. In the mid-1690s he wrote and published two pamphlets, <span class="italic">A Letter from Moses Pitt</span> (1695), defending Bishop Burnet, and <span class="italic">An Account of one Ann Jefferies</span> (1696), which in December 1696 he sent to the Revd William Turner for inclusion in his work <span class="italic">Remarkable Providences</span> (1697). Pitt died the following year. In his will (administration to his widow, 8 October 1697) he was described as printer in St Gregory's parish close to St Paul's, and he may have begun to try to reconstruct his career in these familiar surroundings. His estate was to be divided between his widow, Mary, and his son, John, who was to be given control of all his leases and property.<br>
