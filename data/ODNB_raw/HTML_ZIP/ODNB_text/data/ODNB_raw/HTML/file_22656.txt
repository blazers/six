<span class="headword">Powell,  Martin</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1725), <span class="occ">puppet-showman</span>, came to notice early in the eighteenth century. He had established a theatre in Bath by 1709, which apparently attracted a fashionable audience and was alluded to in the pages of <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>. In 1710 he gave a season in London, and in 1711 he opened Punch's Theatre in the Little Piazza at Covent Garden, probably at no. 20 in the south-east corner. Here the sexton at St Paul's Church was assumed by Steele to have written a letter to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> complaining that the congregation at the church took the warning of his bell morning and evening as notice that Powell was about to perform. This was clearly a joke, but it hints at the popularity of the show with a middle-class and aristocratic public.<br>
<br>Powell performed in London only for three seasons of six months each, but during this time he produced twenty plays. Some of these were based on legendary tales from ballads and chapbooks, such as <span class="italic">The History of Sir Richard Whittington</span> or <span class="italic">King Bladud, the Founder of the Bath</span>, which were the staple fare of puppet shows everywhere. These traditional stories were, however, alternated with more sophisticated satires of contemporary society, such as <span class="italic">Poor Robin's Dream, or, The Vices of the Age Exposed</span>, based on a ballad of the day, in which the gallants, the whores, and the quacks were miraculously reformed, and poets had guineas in their pockets. And then there was a series of operatic burlesques such as <span class="italic">The False Triumph, or, The Siege of Troy</span>, in which Signor Punchanella appeared in the role of Jupiter, descended from the clouds in a chariot drawn by eagles, and sang an aria in Punch's squeaky voice to Paris; or a dig at a recent production of <span class="italic">Hydaspes</span>, in which Nicolini had fought a lion on the stage, with a scene in which Punch danced a minuet with a live pig. Powell was, indeed, a master of satire, and Lord Chesterfield recalled how:<blockquote>there was a great number of fanatics, who said they had, and very possibly actually thought they had, the gift of prophecy &hellip; The then ministry &hellip; were however wise enough not to disturb these madmen, and only ordered one Powell, who was the master of a famous puppet-show, to make Punch turn prophet, which he did so well, that it soon put an end to the prophets and their prophecies. (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span>, 2.528)</blockquote>A contemporary complained that &#145;Mr. Powell, by subscriptions and full house, has gathered such wealth as is ten times sufficient to buy all the poets in England, and that he seldom goes out without his chair&#146;  (<span class="italic">Les soupirs de la Grande Bretagne</span>), but his fourth Covent Garden season closed early, and almost nothing is known of his later career. He had died by 1725, and his son succeeded him, but only at the fairgrounds.<br>
<br>In 1714 Thomas Burnet and George Duckett published <span class="italic">A Second Tale of a Tub, or, The History of Robert Powel the Puppet-Show-Man</span>. This was really a political satire aimed at Robert Harley, but it incorporated a few apparently true references to the real Powell. By the time it appeared Powell was no longer performing in London, but he may be said to have founded a tradition of puppet satire which was continued during the eighteenth century by Charlotte Charke, the daughter of Colley Cibber; by Henry Fielding, using the <i>nom de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i> of Madame de la Nash; and by Samuel Foote and Charles Dibdin. He also helped to develop the character of Punch, which had been introduced to England in 1662, and which reached its climax in the Punch and Judy show of the next century.<br>
