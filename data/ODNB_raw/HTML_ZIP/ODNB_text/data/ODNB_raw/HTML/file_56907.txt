<span class="headword">Household,  Geoffrey Edward West</span>  (1900&#150;1988), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 30 November 1900 in Clifton, a suburb of Bristol, the son of Horace West Household (1870&#150;1954), secretary of education for Gloucestershire, and his wife, Lucy Beatrice Noton (1870&#150;1955). Household's grandfather had inherited an estate in Norfolk, but this had to be sold following the agricultural depression of the 1870s. His father qualified as a barrister and then took up a career in education. Household was educated at Durnford preparatory school, and at Clifton College. He then went to Magdalen College, Oxford, where in 1922 he took a first in English. He had no particular ambition, and might easily have followed his father into the civil service; instead, through a Magdalen connection, he joined the Ottoman Bank and was sent to Bucharest. So began twenty-five years of almost uninterrupted residence abroad.<br>
<br>Bucharest was the making of Household. Thanks to the very favourable exchange rate he could live like a prince on &pound;400 a year. The callow former public schoolboy became a discriminating hedonist, well versed in the pleasures of the table and the bed. About banking he was less enthusiastic, so that when, in 1926, he had to choose between his job and Elisaveta (Betty) Kopelanoff, the Americanized Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;e he would later marry, he chose Betty. But neither party relished domesticity, and it was not until 1935, five years after they were married, that they began, &#145;reluctantly&#146;, to cohabit  (Household, 93). They were divorced in 1942. From 1926 to 1929 Household sold bananas in Spain for Elders and Fyffes. He fell in love with the Basque country and its &#145;noble&#146; inhabitants but could not persuade Betty to settle there  (&#145;Lives and times of Geoffrey Household&#146;). Instead he joined her in the United States, in Los Angeles, reckoning that there would be jobs to spare in Hollywood now that the talkies had arrived. But nobody made him an offer, so he followed Betty to New York, arriving just as the stock market crashed. Reduced to living off bread and bananas, he landed a job writing entries for a children's encyclopaedia. He did this and similar tasks for two years until, tiring of hack writing and bathtub gin, he returned to England. There followed four peripatetic years in Europe, the Near East, and South America as a traveller in printing inks. Then in 1935, with an advance from the Atlantic Monthly Press, to whom he had sent a long short story, he began work on his first novel, <span class="italic">The Third Hour</span>. This was followed by a book of short stories and then, in September 1939, came <span class="italic">Rogue Male</span>, the spare, tense thriller that put Household firmly and forever on the map.<br>
<br>A passionate believer in European civilization, Household blamed Hitler personally for perverting it. &#145;The man had to be dealt with, and I began to think how much I would like to kill him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 Oct 1988). This is the departure point for <span class="italic">Rogue Male</span>, in which a laconic English sportsman sets out to bag &#145;the biggest game on earth&#146;  (G. Household, <span class="italic">Rogue Male</span>, 1973 edn, 7&#150;8), only to be hunted down in his turn. Reviewers were enthusiastic, but Household was too preoccupied to register more than a &#145;detached pleasure&#146;  (Household, 211) in what they said. He was back in Bucharest, attached to a section of the British military mission, whose task was to blow up the Romanian oil wells if and when the Germans invaded. But in June 1940 the increasingly pro-axis Romanians got wind of the section's plan and it had to be aborted. Three months later, after various central European adventures, Household arrived in Cairo. There he joined field security&#151;&#145;the only branch of Intelligence in which a free-lance could enjoy the care and companionship of a unit under his own command&#146;  (Household, 121)&#151;and was almost immediately sent with his section to Greece.<br>
<br>In his autobiography, <span class="italic">Against the Wind</span>, Household admitted that it was not simply the urge to have a crack at Hitler that impelled him to join the special reserve of officers during Munich week. Like many others who had just missed the First World War, he had a &#145;burning curiosity&#146;  (Household, 99) to know what it was like to be under fire. His curiosity was satisfied in April 1941 during the Greek d&eacute;b&acirc;cle, from which he managed to extricate his men &#145;naked, but reasonably unashamed&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span> 7 Oct 1988). He then served in Palestine, Syria, and Iraq, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and being mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Household returned from the war with a family. In 1942 he married Ilona Maria Judith Zsoldos-Gutm&aacute;n (<i>b</i>. 1914), a Hungarian he had met in Jerusalem, and by 1945 they had a son and a daughter (a second daughter was born in 1953). Providing for his dependants proved a struggle until, reluctantly (for he disliked the brutality of the genre), he wrote two further thrillers, <span class="italic">A Rough Shoot</span> and its sequel, <span class="italic">A Time to Kill</span>. Rather more to his taste were picaresque novels of suspense such as <span class="italic">The Lives and Times of Bernado Brown</span>, whose hero &#145;is in trouble with everyone and yet is not what is commonly called a criminal&#146;  (&#145;Lives and times of Geoffrey Household&#146;). He felt most at home with the short story, and said he would prefer to be judged by collections like <span class="italic">Tales of Adventurers</span> and <span class="italic">Sabres in the Sand</span> than by any of his novels.<br>
<br>Household had always intended to settle in the country, but was unable to leave London permanently until 1957, when he and Ilona moved from Chiswick to Buckinghamshire. There, every morning, he would write between 700 and 1000 words in pencil, knock off for lunch, garden in the afternoon, and then type up the morning's work between tea and dinner. Apart from his family, his writing, and his garden, he took pleasure in animals, especially cats, log fires, good food and wine, and reading history and biography. He loathed mediocrity and bureaucracy in equal measure, and when, in 1970, it looked as if a third London airport might be built nearby, put his saboteur's skills at the disposal of the local resistance movement.<br>
<br>Household once described himself as &#145;an Englishman with no national prejudices&#146;, but in <span class="italic">Against the Wind</span> he admitted to being &#145;at bottom far more typical of my countrymen than it pleases me to think&#146;  (Household, 71, 131). With his lean frame, deep, fruity voice, pink cheeks, and bristling moustache, he had ex-officer written all over him. He published his last novel in 1988, and died shortly afterwards from heart failure on 4 October 1988 at Wardington House, Banbury, Oxfordshire; after a funeral service at St James's Church, Newbottle, his remains were cremated in Oxford crematorium on 11 October.<br>
