<span class="headword">Orton,  Harold</span>  (1898&#150;1975), <span class="occ">dialectologist</span>, was born on 23 October 1898 in the village of Byers Green, co. Durham, younger son of the village schoolmaster, Thomas Orton (<i>d</i>. 1942), and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blair. He attended King James I Grammar School, Bishop Auckland, and in 1916 went on to Hatfield College, University of Durham, from where he enlisted in the Durham light infantry. He served as a lieutenant from 1917 to 1919. Having been wounded twice on the same day in 1918 he was under threat of the amputation of his right arm, which he refused to allow. He made himself a left-handed writer and invariably offered his left hand to shake hands, as using the right arm caused great pain.<br>
<br>After demobilization Orton studied at Merton College, Oxford, under Professor H. C. Wyld. Another of his tutors was Joseph Wright, editor of the <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span>. He gained the degrees of BA in 1921, BLitt in 1923, and MA in 1924. He became lektor at Uppsala, Sweden, from 1924 to 1928. On 16 December 1925 he married (Dorothy) Joan (1902&#150;1985), the youngest daughter of the Revd R. Burnham, rector of Trimley St Mary's, Suffolk; they had one daughter, Betty Jean.<br>
<br>In 1928 Orton was appointed to lecture at King's College, Newcastle, then a college of the University of Durham. He published in 1933 <span class="italic">The Phonology of a South Durham Dialect</span>, written following the tradition of Joseph Wright, outlining the historical development of local speech of his native village. At Newcastle he continued to develop his interest in collecting local speech and inaugurated a Northumbrian dialect survey. He used a portable disc-cutting machine to record local voices in homes and hostelries, and material from as early as 1935 survives, copied digitally to tape.<br>
<br>In September 1939 Orton was appointed lecturer in charge of English language at Sheffield University but was very soon seconded as a wartime post to the British Council, where he was assistant education director, later acting education officer. After his return to Sheffield when the war ended he renewed a friendship with Professor Eugen Dieth of Z&uuml;rich University, and the two began collaboration on a questionnaire to be used in a dialect survey. He was appointed to the chair of English language and medieval English literature at Leeds University in 1946, and he continued through several summer vacations with Dieth, preparing a series of versions of a <span class="italic">Questionnaire for a Linguistic Atlas of England</span>, which was published by the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society in 1951.<br>
<br>An English dialect survey became Orton's life's work, and he combined teaching and research tirelessly to promote interest in dialectology. The whole staff of his department was newly appointed in 1946 and he collected around him a distinguished team of academics in the various fields of Old and Middle English literature, philology, phonetics, and Scandinavian, Celtic, and Germanic language studies. He resurrected &#145;Leeds Studies in English&#146; publications in 1952 and was editor from 1952 until 1964. During his time at Leeds a school of English was formed by merging his own department and that of English literature. He served on many of the governing bodies of organizations promoting English studies. Orton was well remembered by students for his stimulating teaching. He promoted undergraduate and postgraduate dissertations by students on living local dialects.<br>
<br>Orton was a great raconteur and his benevolent manner made him a popular companion over lunch in the senior common room. His highly successful attempts at describing individuals' linguistic backgrounds established his fame as a local Professor Higgins, the character in Shaw's <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span>. He was an adept administrator and served with skill on senate and its committees during the complex post-war period of expansion of the university. He served for periods as dean of arts and as chairman of the board of arts.<br>
<br>Money for research support was extremely scarce during those years and Orton was determined in his efforts to augment the university's financial support for the establishment and the running of the dialect survey. In addition to obtaining help from private individuals and foundations, he also persuaded the university to appoint qualified research assistants for field work which continued for over ten years. By the time the collection was complete there was material in phonetic script of answers to the more than 1300 questions of the <span class="italic">Questionnaire</span> from a total of 313 localities. Mobile tape recorders became available about the time the collection began, and a recorded archive was made under his direction. He worked tirelessly at editing the twelve volumes of basic material, and the publication, <span class="italic">Survey of English Dialects, 1962&#150;72</span>, was achieved at considerable sacrifice of family life and leisure time. The sheer volume of the editorial work he undertook gave rise to the phrase, famous among his collaborators, &#145;yawn and bash on&#146;. He was unsparing of himself and encouraged those working with him to be the same. His personal energy and his absolute determination to see the <span class="italic">Survey</span> completed made this massive research survey the sole major language project to be completed in those difficult post-war years.<br>
<br>On retiring from his chair Orton became professor emeritus in 1964. An institute of dialect and folk life studies was founded at Leeds University, and there followed years working with scholars from Britain and abroad. He visited many American universities after his retirement, promoting dialect studies, and collaborated with Nathalia Wright at the University of Tennessee in the publication of <span class="italic">A Word Geography of England</span> (1974). <span class="italic">The Linguistic Atlas of England</span> was published after his death.<br>
<br>Among honours bestowed on Orton were the degrees of honorary LittD in 1969 from the University of Durham and doctor of philosophy <i>honoris causa</i> in 1970 from the University of Uppsala. He died on 7 March 1975 at Harrowby Crescent, Leeds, having continued to work until a few weeks earlier, when he suffered a stroke. At his funeral at Lawnswood, Leeds, on 12 March 1975 Stewart Sanderson, director of the institute, said friends who mourned Harold would still have a sense of gratitude at the privilege of having known him, which would far outweigh their sense of loss.<br>
