<span class="headword">Thom,  William</span>  (1710&#150;1790), <span class="occ">author and Church of Scotland minister</span>, was born at New Monkland, near Glasgow. Nothing is known of his parents or his early life. He was educated at Glasgow University, where he studied under the celebrated moral philosophy professor Francis Hutcheson. Thom received his MA in 1732 and was licensed by the presbytery of Hamilton in 1738, but he did not receive a call to the ministry until 1746; during that period he was described by another young minister, Alexander Carlyle, as having had &#145;great sway&#146; among the other young men of the Literary Society  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, ed. Burton, 52). In May 1746 Thom was presented to the parish of Govan, Lanarkshire, by the professors of Glasgow University, who held the patronage of the parish. The call was opposed by the parishioners, probably because of their dissatisfaction with the principle of patronage and Thom's association with members of the modernizing or moderate faction within the church, and the ordination was delayed until 25 February 1748.<br>
<br>During a ministry of more than four decades Thom worked effectively to overcome that opposition. Although his call had been sponsored by the moderate leadership of Glasgow University, in a series of more than twenty controversial sermons and tracts, most published anonymously, he would gradually align himself with their ecclesiastical opponents in the orthodox or popular party. His 1766 <span class="italic">Short History of the Late General Assembly</span> announced his opposition to ecclesiastical patronage, the principal dividing line between moderate and popular clergyman, despite the fact that he owed his own position to that practice. He also began a lengthy dispute with his patrons at Glasgow University, in part because they refused to augment his stipend; he developed his case in a series of six critical pamphlets, in which he first displayed the sarcastic wit for which he became famous. Yet there were serious issues involved. In <span class="italic">The Motives which have Determined the University of Glasgow to Desert the Blackfriar Church</span> (1764), Thom criticized the professors for attending their own chapel rather than hearing a local orthodox preacher, John Gillies. More substantively, his <span class="italic">Defects of an University Education, and its unsuitableness to a Commercial People</span> (1761) criticized the classical curriculum at the university for devoting excessive attention to such rarefied subjects as the metaphysics of morals&#151;implicitly criticizing his former teacher Francis Hutcheson&#151;instead of a practical education based upon the mechanical arts and history.<br>
<br>Thom also became a strong advocate of the interests of farmers and weavers, who formed the bulk of the congregants in his parish, reflected in his 1771 <span class="italic">Letter of Advice to the Farmers, Land-Labourers, and Country Tradesmen in Scotland</span>. In a series of five or more anonymous pamphlets beginning with his 1770 <span class="italic">Seasonable Advice to the Landholders and Farmers in Scotland</span>, he also became Scotland's most prominent promoter of their emigration to America. Like other popular party ministers, he expressed considerable sympathy for the position of the American colonies during their war for independence, about which he published three sermons. He married Grizel Scot on 22 October 1753, and they had four children before her death in 1760. On 17 April 1780 he married Agnes, daughter of John M'Kechnie, merchant in Glasgow. William Thom died at Govan on 8 August 1790; his second wife died in 1817.<br>
<br>Since his death Thom has been known principally for his eccentricity and wit. Only recently have historians come to appreciate his prominent role as a critic of the classical style of education at Glasgow University, which helped inspire the development of the practically orientated Anderson's Institution, the forerunner of the University of Strathclyde, founded in 1796 by the popular party adherent John Anderson. Because most of his works appeared anonymously, Thom's prominent influence in encouraging emigration from Scotland to America during the 1770s was not recognized for two centuries. Thom's career highlights the developing ties that emerged in eighteenth-century Scotland among popular presbyterianism, the growing artisan class, and a keen interest in America.<br>
