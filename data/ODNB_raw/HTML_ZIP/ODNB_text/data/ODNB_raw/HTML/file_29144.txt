<span class="headword">Wetherall, Sir  Frederick Augustus</span>  (1754&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of John Wetherall, a government official, of North Great George Street, Dublin. He obtained a commission as ensign in the 17th foot on 23 August 1775, embarked for Boston in September, and became lieutenant on 27 August 1776. During the American War of Independence he served with his regiment in the defence of Boston, and at the actions of Brooklyn, White Plains, Princeton, Brandywine, and Monmouth. In 1780 he was in command of a company serving as marines on HMS <i>Alfred</i> and participated in the victories off capes Finisterre and St Vincent. In 1781 he married Elizabeth Mytton (<i>d</i>. 1810). Their son was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29145/', "Sir George Augustus Wetherall")</script>. On 17 May of that same year he was made captain of an independent company which he had raised, and which was embodied in the 104th foot on 2 March 1782.<br>
<br>Wetherall exchanged to the 11th foot on 16 April 1783, served six years with that regiment at Gibraltar, and accompanied the duke of Kent, as a member of his household, to Quebec in 1791. He was aide-de-camp and comptroller of the duke's household during the operations in the West Indies, and received two wounds at the taking of Martinique in March 1794. He had become major in the 11th on 1 March, and on 23 August, when the duke of Kent took command of the troops in Nova Scotia, he was appointed deputy adjutant-general there. On 20 May 1795 he obtained the lieutenant-colonelcy of Keppel's regiment, newly raised for service in the West Indies, and served with it in San Domingo. While on his way with dispatches to Barbados he was wounded and taken prisoner. He was kept in irons at Guadeloupe for nine months before he was exchanged, and suffered such privations that some men of the 32nd, who were also prisoners, raised a subscription for him. He returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia, as adjutant-general, but on 3 August 1796 he was transferred to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 82nd regiment, which was then in San Domingo.<br>
<br>When the duke of Kent became commander-in-chief in North America in 1799, Wetherall again served on his staff as adjutant-general, but the duke resigned the following year. On 29 April 1802 Wetherall was made brevet colonel, and in 1803 he raised a regiment of Nova Scotia fencibles, and was appointed its colonel from 9 July. In May 1806 he was appointed brigadier in the Caribee Islands, and in October at the Cape of Good Hope. On 25 October 1809 he was promoted major-general and placed on the staff in India. Early in 1810, on his way to Calcutta, he was taken prisoner and held in Mauritius for two months until exchanged. The same year his wife died at the Cape.<br>
<br>In November 1810 Wetherall was appointed second in command, under Sir Samuel Auchmuty, of the expedition to Java. He was thanked in general orders for his share in the battle of Cornelis, on 26 August 1811, and received the thanks of parliament and the gold medal for the conquest of Java. Later, in 1827&#150;8, he made unsuccessful attempts to claim an extra &pound;20,356 in prize money for the campaign, believing that the distribution made in 1815 was unjust. From Java he returned to India, and held command in Mysore until June 1815. He had become lieutenant-general on 4 June 1814, and was equerry, and afterwards executor, to the duke of Kent. In 1817 he married Elizabeth Ann Broad (1778/9&#150;1846), the widow of Major Richard Broad and the daughter of W. Mair of Kensington.<br>
<br>In February 1833 Wetherall received the grand cross of the Royal Guelphic Order; he had petitioned unsuccessfully in 1816 to be created a knight commander of the Bath. On 10 January 1837 he relinquished the governorship of Blackness Castle, which he had held since 1830, when he became both a general and colonel of the 62nd foot. He was transferred to his old regiment, the 17th, on 17 February 1840. He died, aged eighty-eight, at his home in Castlebar Hill, Ealing, on 18 December 1842, and was buried on 24 December in St Mary's churchyard, Ealing, where he has a monument.<br>
