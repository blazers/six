<span class="headword">Lohia,  Ram Manohar</span>  (1910&#150;1967), <span class="occ">politician in India</span>, was born on 23 March 1910 in the small town of Akbarpur, in Faizabad district, United Provinces, India, the only child of Hiralal (<i>d</i>. 1945), a teacher and trader, and his wife, Chanda, who died during his early childhood. Although born into the Marwari Bania caste, Lohia was an ardent opponent of the institution of caste throughout his life. Influenced as a youth by his father's nationalism and involvement in the Indian National Congress, he developed an early and life-long dedication to a united, independent Indian nation. He attended local schools in Akbarpur; secondary school at the Marwari School in Bombay; the Banaras Hindu University and then the Vidyasagar College at Calcutta University, where he received his degree in English in 1929; and finally Berlin University, where he received a PhD degree in <i>Staatswissenschaften</i> in 1932. He left Germany and went home to India in 1933. He was witness, therefore, to the rise of Hitler, whose evil he condemned. He developed an antipathy for the communists as well.<br>
<br>Lohia was a committed radical socialist politician throughout his adult life. He was one of the founders, in 1934, of the small Congress Socialist Party, an organized group within the Indian National Congress. As an admirer and disciple of Gandhi, Lohia was also a committed practitioner of non-violent resistance and civil disobedience against unjust authority and laws, which, as a universalist, he practised wherever he found injustice. He was arrested twenty-five times. He participated in and often organized and led resistance movements against British rule in India, Congress rule in post-independence India, and Portuguese rule in Goa. He agitated for democracy in Nepal, and, during a visit to America, in Jackson, Mississippi, he twice attempted to dine in a segregated, whites-only restaurant and was arrested and gaoled briefly on 28 May 1964. He was one of the principal leaders of the Quit India movement of 1942, during which he worked underground, attempting to establish radio transmitter systems to co-ordinate anti-British actions. During his longest internment, which began on 20 May 1944, he was lodged in the infamous Lahore Fort gaol, where he was subjected to four months of torture, including solitary confinement and intensive questioning during prolonged periods of sleep deprivation. He was not released from prison until 11 April 1946.<br>
<br>In 1948, after independence, the Socialist Party separated from the Congress. A sequence of splits and mergers soon followed. Lohia was one of the principal leaders and general secretary of the Praja Socialist Party (PSP), founded in 1952 after a merger of the Socialist Party with the Kisan Mazdoor Praja (peasants and workers peoples' party). However, he ultimately differed with every other important leader in the socialist movement on both policies and tactics. When the PSP split in 1955&#150;6, he became the first chairman of the new Socialist Party (later renamed, after further failed efforts to re-unite the socialist movement, the Samyukta&#151;United&#151;Socialist Party) and remained its unchallenged leader until his death. After two unsuccessful attempts to win election to parliament, he was elected for the first time in 1963, and again in 1967 during the first great upheaval against Congress rule in the country, of which he, through his doctrine of &#145;non-Congressism&#146;, calling for the alliance of all political parties against the ruling party, was the principal architect.<br>
<br>Lohia articulated many original ideological and practical goals in numerous books, collections of essays and speeches, and articles for the socialist journal, <span class="italic">Mankind</span>, of which he was the founder and editor. He formulated the concept of the &#145;equal irrelevance&#146; of the two contesting creeds of capitalism and communism to Indian and Asian needs. He was also justly credited with both the intellectual and practical foundation of the movement of the &#145;backward&#146; castes and classes in Indian politics. The Socialist Party's platform called for displacement of the high castes from their dominance in Indian political life through reservation of 60 per cent of places in all government positions for the middle and lower castes, tribal peoples, backward Muslims, and other minorities, and women. This movement began to bear fruit by the time of his death.<br>
<br>Although he never married, Lohia was, in life, a lover of women and, in politics, devoted to female equality and emancipation in every respect. His companion of many years until his death was Roma Mitra. He had an ebullient personality, combative but good-humoured in politics, full of life and political passion, an independent and principled free-thinker, a truth-teller and anti-hypocrite, indeed of the rare breed who are worthy of the name a &#145;free spirit&#146;. He died, while still in the prime of life, in the night of 12&#150;13 October 1967, of complications following a prostate operation, in the Willingdon Hospital (later renamed the Dr Ram Manohar Hospital), New Delhi. He had no surviving family, nor did he leave behind any wealth or property.<br>
