<span class="headword">Cooke,  George Wingrove</span>  (1814&#150;1865), <span class="occ">legal and historical writer</span>, eldest son of Thomas Homans Cooke, who came from a Devon family, was born at Bristol. He studied law under Andrew Amos at London University, and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in January 1835. He was at the same time completing his classical education at Jesus College, Oxford, where he took his BA in 1834.<br>
<br>From the first, Cooke was a prolific writer, rarely needing to correct or retouch what he had written. While still an undergraduate he wrote <span class="italic">Memoirs of Lord Bolingbroke</span>, which was published in 1835. Clearly written from a whig standpoint, the book was unfavourably reviewed by John Croker in the tory <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, but was strongly defended in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>.<br>
<br>Encouraged by this success, Cooke went on to publish a <span class="italic">History of Party from the Rise of the Whig and Tory Factions to the Passing of the Reform Bill</span> (1836&#150;7) and a <span class="italic">Life of the First Earl Shaftesbury</span> (1836), edited from the materials collected by Andrew Kippis, Benjamin Martyn, and others.<br>
<br>For many years after settling in London, Cooke was employed by the tithe commutation commission in defining the principles and supervising the mechanism for the composition of tithes. He also worked for the enclosure commission in a similar capacity. These years were marked by the preparation and publication of a number of legal treatises, dealing with subjects as diverse as agricultural tenancies and poll booths.<br>
<br>However, Cooke also turned his holidays to advantage by publishing the narratives of his long vacation travels. Most of these appeared anonymously, but in 1855, at the height of the Crimean War, he visited the Crimea, and on his return to his own country vividly described what he had seen in <span class="italic">Inside Sebastopol</span> (1856). Soon afterwards, the managers of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, to which he was a frequent contributor, dispatched him to China as the special correspondent on the outbreak of the second Chinese war in 1857. His dispatches, narrating the progress of the British expedition and the details of life among the Chinese, were republished in book form in 1858, and sold well in several editions.<br>
<br>One of Cooke's holiday expeditions took him to Algiers, where he enquired into the intentions of the French, and speculated as to their prospects of colonization. The results of his investigations appeared as a series of letters in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, published in 1860 as <span class="italic">Conquest and Colonisation in North Africa</span>.<br>
<br>Cooke made two unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament as a Liberal: for Colchester in 1850 and for Marylebone in 1861. In 1862, he was appointed to a commissionership in the copyhold commission. Given to overwork, Cooke fell ill in June 1865. On the morning of 18 June he died of a heart attack at his house, 25 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London.<br>
