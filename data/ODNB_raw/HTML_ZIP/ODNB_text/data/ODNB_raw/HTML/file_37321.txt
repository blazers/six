<span class="headword">Cregeen,  Archibald</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1774, <em>d.</em> 1841), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born in the village of Colby, Isle of Man, and baptized in the parish church of Arbory on 20 November 1774, the third of four sons of William Cregeen, a cooper and small farmer, and his wife, Mary Fairclough (Faircliff in the marriage register of the adjoining parish of Malew, 13 November 1764), who is reported to have come from Ireland. Of his education nothing is known. He was apprenticed as a monumental mason and so must have added literacy in English to his native Manx. After his marriage to Jane Crellin (1775/6&#150;1844) in the parish church of German on 8 March 1798, he built in Colby a house for himself and his family (six daughters and two sons), later called Ravenstone. In alternate years from 1813 he held the office of coroner for the sheading of Rushen in addition to his ordinary occupation.<br>
<br>Cregeen began work about 1814 on what was to be the first published Manx dictionary, collecting words from the Manx <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1770&#150;75), for which he often gave references, from the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and from other printed sources, but also gathering material, words, phrases, scraps of traditional verse, and proverbs, from current usage. He marked stress, the gender and plural of nouns, the stems of verbs, and included old case-forms and all the pronominal prepositions. To this catalogue of inflectional variations he added a generous number of illustrations of the initial mutations. The dictionary is preceded by a sketch of grammar, again concentrating on morphology. In this work of at least twenty years' duration Cregeen was encouraged and assisted by the Revd John Edward Harrison (1784&#150;1858), vicar of Jurby, whose hand has been detected in the preface and the opening paragraphs of the grammar. The dictionary, published in 1835, though not the most copious, is the most serviceable, the most reliable and soundly based, ever produced. It has been reprinted several times, beginning in 1910.<br>
<br>Cregeen died on Good Friday, 9 April 1841, and was buried on 13 April in Arbory churchyard, where his elegant box-tomb is still to be seen south-east of the church.<br>
