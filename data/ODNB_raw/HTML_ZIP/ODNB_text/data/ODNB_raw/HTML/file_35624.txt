</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Prothero,  Rowland Edmund</span>, first Baron Ernle  (1851&#150;1937), <span class="occ">author, land agent, and politician</span>, was the third son of Canon George Prothero and Emma, daughter of the Revd William Money Kyrle of Homme House, Herefordshire; he was born at Clifton upon Teme, Worcestershire, on 6 September 1851. His father was the rector of Whippingham in the Isle of Wight, and the proximity of the church to Osborne, Queen Victoria's summer residence, brought the Prothero family into close contact with the royal family and their many distinguished guests. Educated first at home by his mother, who gave him a grounding in English, Latin, French, and German, the young Prothero also learned arithmetic and writing from the village schoolmaster. At the age of ten he was sent to Temple Grove at East Sheen, London, a well-known private school; but a prolonged illness kept him at home until he was well enough to go to Marlborough in 1864. From there he entered Balliol College, Oxford, to read law and history, took a first class in modern history in 1875, and shortly afterwards was elected a fellow of All Souls.<br>
<br>After a year spent at Darmstadt improving his German, Prothero trained as a barrister and practised briefly on the Oxford circuit until, in 1881, the weakening of his eyesight obliged him to give up a career in the law. In an effort to improve his eyes he took up an outdoor life, walking the length and breadth of France. His time there, spent following the paths of Jeanne d'Arc, Agn&egrave;s Sorel, and Rabelais, and staying in primitive village inns, gave him a lasting love for that country, and led eventually to a collection of his essays on French poetry and related topics in <span class="italic">The Pleasant Land of France</span>, published in 1908.<br>
<br>His choice of career still limited by his improved but frail eyesight, Prothero was a proctor at Oxford in 1883&#150;4, and then, at the age of thirty-three, embarked on gaining a livelihood by his pen, a profession which gave him some latitude in the hours he chose to devote daily to reading and writing. He was, nevertheless, remarkably prolific, publishing as many as fifty-four unsigned articles in seven years, mainly in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. He developed an attractively simple, pellucid style, writing on a variety of biographical, historical, topographical, political, and literary subjects, as well as producing obituaries of leading figures of the day, and contributing signed articles to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> and other periodicals. Having some knowledge of farming (some farmland was attached to the rectory at Whippingham), he wrote in 1887&#150;8 for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> on the effect of the great depression in agriculture on the glebe lands of the clergy, and on the anti-tithe agitation in Wales. A long-standing interest in the history of agriculture led in 1888 to a book on <span class="italic">The Pioneers and Progress of English Farming</span>, which was subsequently developed into his well-known <span class="italic">English Farming Past and Present</span>, a work hailed as a &#145;classic&#146; on its appearance in 1912, and which went through five editions in the author's lifetime.<br>
<br>Prothero's literary career advanced as he became assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century</span>, and in 1893 editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>. His position had become financially secure and in August 1891 he married Mary Beatrice, third daughter of John Bailward of Horsington Manor, Somerset, and the sister of an old undergraduate friend at Balliol. They were married by Canon Prothero in the Henry VII chapel of Westminster Abbey, and settled down to live at 3 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, a house which remained Prothero's London home for the rest of his life. His wife, a gifted artist in water-colours and a lover of horses and dogs, gave him a son, and they enjoyed a brief seven and a half years of &#145;perfect happiness&#146; until her untimely death in 1899.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, a steady flow of major works ran from Prothero's pen&#151;a life of A. P. Stanley in 1893, and in 1896 his edition of the previously unpublished <span class="italic">Letters of Edward Gibbon, 1753&#150;94</span>, followed in 1898&#150;1901 by the six volumes of the <span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</span>. Queen Victoria commissioned from him for private circulation a <span class="italic">Life of Prince Henry of Battenberg</span> (1897). A familiar figure at literary gatherings of the period, Prothero rubbed shoulders with such celebrities as Gladstone, Tennyson, Browning, Huxley, and Oscar Wilde. Through visits home to Whippingham his acquaintances also included Crown Prince Frederick of Germany and his wife, and Princess Alice, the second daughter of Queen Victoria who had married Prince Louis of Hesse (with whom he frequently dined while at Darmstadt), as well as many other distinguished members of the European aristocracy.<br>
<br>Suddenly, in 1898, Prothero decided to give up his now established literary career and turn to estate management, accepting the handsome offer of the duke of Bedford to become his chief agent. Prothero was then aged forty-seven and, as he remarked, if he were to make a new career this was the time. He was succeeded as editor of the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> by his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35623/', "George Walter Prothero")</script>.<br>
<br>Prothero's change of course was not quite so abrupt or so unlikely as some contemporaries supposed, for he had already some experience in managing estates for an uncle and for All Souls. His move to Bedfordshire was marred by a great personal loss&#151;the death of his wife&#151;but three years later, in April 1902, he married Barbara Jane, the only daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Hamley, who after her father's early death had spent much of her life with her uncle, General Sir Edward Hamley, MP for Stockport. She was an early supporter of the cause of women's suffrage, and also a talented miniature painter, and a writer of short stories, which were published in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span>. She died in 1930, predeceasing her husband by seven years.<br>
<br>While serving as chief agent for the duke of Bedford, Prothero still managed to put aside two or three hours a day for reading and writing, and continued to publish books and articles. In 1903 began the third phase of his life, a career in public life. He became chairman of the higher education committee of Bedfordshire county council, and in 1907 stood unsuccessfully as Unionist candidate for the parliamentary seat of Biggleswade. The introduction of the 1911 <span class="roman">National Insurance Act</span> encouraged him to put forward a scheme for associating village benefit clubs into large groups, and for long he was president of the newly formed National Federation of Rural Approved Societies, an organization always close to his heart and for which he was widely remembered by farm workers. In 1914 he was chosen to stand unopposed as member of parliament for the University of Oxford, though at the age of sixty-three he found life in the House of Commons somewhat strange and lonely. However, he served on two highly important inquiries, the Milner and Selborne committees on agriculture, whose proposals he was to put into effect when asked by Lloyd George in December 1916 to become president of the board of agriculture.<br>
<br>As president Prothero undertook a demanding role at a time of crisis, when as a result of the German submarine warfare the nation's food supplies were under severe threat and it was becoming evident that the expansion of agricultural production at home was vital for sustaining the war effort. In promoting his &#145;plough campaign&#146; to expand production of grains and potatoes on suitable grasslands, Prothero found it difficult at first to convince farmers and the public of the need for urgent and drastic measures. His plans for higher production had to meet the problems of shortages of farm equipment, inadequate supplies of fertilizers, and, not least, a critical lack of labour as many skilled farm workers had joined the armed forces. In addition to obtaining the services of British troops, German prisoners of war, and public schoolboys to help get in the crops, he also established a women's branch of the board of agriculture to recruit village women and to organize the Women's Land Army, as well as to foster the infant Women's Institute movement. The success of the plough campaign in adding nearly 3 million acres to the arable acreage, together with the passing of the 1917 <span class="roman">Corn Production Act</span> (designed to win over farmers to the policy of expanding corn production after many years of converting to more profitable grass) played a key part in sustaining the country through the final stages of the First World War. The <span class="roman">Corn Production Act</span> also promised to put British agriculture on a new post-war course of government-supported high production, thereby ending the long depression which had affected grain farming before the war. The failure of government to follow Prothero's policies after his resignation in 1919 was a prime cause of the agricultural problems that arose in the 1920s.<br>
<br>Prothero's retirement from government was probably hastened by the news near the end of the war of the death of his only son in Mesopotamia. He had been created Baron Ernle in 1919, and lived on in retirement, still battling with weakening eyesight, for a further eighteen years. Two more books appeared in the 1920s, <span class="italic">The Land and its People</span> (1925) and <span class="italic">The Light Reading of our Ancestors</span> (1927), the latter reflecting an early interest in the history of the novel, which he had long postponed fulfilling. His delightful volume of reminiscences, <span class="italic">Whippingham to Westminster</span>, was left almost complete at his death and appeared in 1938. He was the recipient of many honours, not the least to him the presidency of the MCC in 1924&#150;5, a testimony to his lifelong support of cricket. As a great wartime administrator of agriculture Ernle's reputation remains undiminished, and many of the measures which he introduced for the control and expansion of farming to meet the food crisis of the First World War were reinstituted in the Second. Of his many books, <span class="italic">English Farming Past and Present</span> best survived the test of time, reaching a sixth edition in 1961, and continuing to serve as a major source for the history of agriculture.<br>
<br>Physically Ernle was an impressively tall, thin, and erect figure, very active in his habits and one inclined to walk rather than take a cab. In his earlier years he was an enthusiastic cricketer, playing at Oxford and later for I Zingari and the Harlequins. He was also a lifelong collector of portrait busts and figures in china and brass. He was always assiduous at attending to his responsibilities and was widely admired for his good judgement and great integrity, as well as for his unfailing wit and charm. He died on 1 July 1937, in his eighty-seventh year, at his country home, Ginge Manor, near Wantage, Berkshire, close to the garden he always loved.<br>
