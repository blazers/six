<span class="headword">Cooper,  Daniel</span>  (1785&#150;1853), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was born at Bolton, Lancashire, one of at least two sons of Thomas Cooper and his first wife, Hannah. Little is known of his early life but in 1815 Cooper was convicted of theft and transported for life to the penal colony of New South Wales. He arrived in Sydney in 1816, and was granted a conditional pardon in 1818 which was made absolute in 1821. In 1819 he married Hannah Dodd (<i>d</i>. 1836), a fellow convict who had been sentenced to sixteen years' transportation in 1816. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Cooper opened a general store in Sydney, from which he diversified into shipping and brewing. In 1821 he became a partner in the firm of Hutchison, Terry &amp; Co., which expanded from flour milling into general merchandising and banking. Cooper and another former convict, Solomon Levey, took over the firm in 1825, each investing &pound;30,000. Levey had been sentenced to seven years' transportation in 1813, and had arrived in Sydney in 1815. He was granted an absolute pardon in 1819, when he married Ann, the daughter of William Roberts, a wealthy emancipist. Although she left Levey, her dowry allowed him to build up a flourishing business in real estate, retailing, shipbroking, sealing, rope making, and grazing. He was also a leading figure in the formation of the Bank of New South Wales, of which Cooper became a director in 1828. The firm of Cooper and Levey subsequently became a major merchant house in Sydney, combining a large retail trade with the import of goods and the export of wool, as well as having related interests as shipowners, shipping agents, and whalers. Both Cooper and Levey invested much of their profits in extensive holdings of land, which placed them among the largest squatters and holders of stock in New South Wales.<br>
<br>Expansion of the firm demanded a closer connection with London, in order to purchase goods for export to Sydney and to provide trade credit, a similar need to that faced by F. G. Dalgety. In 1826 Levey settled in London, with the purpose of opening a branch there, but he made the disastrous mistake in 1829 of joining Thomas Peel as a partner in his ill-fated scheme to develop the Swan River in Western Australia. Levey supplied &pound;20,000 capital to the abortive venture. Fortunately for Cooper, much of his wealth was invested outside the firm in real estate, and he was able to escape from the crisis caused by Levey's ill-judged speculation. As a result Cooper took on new partners in Sydney, and returned to England in 1831 in order to purchase goods and to arrange shipping. Eventually the difficulties caused by Levey's involvement with Peel were resolved, in 1843, when Cooper reached a settlement with John Levey-Roberts, the son of Solomon Levey, who had opted for a life of leisure in Paris. Cooper died of disease of the heart at the Gloucester Hotel, Gloucester Place, Brighton, on 3 November 1853.<br>
<br>The bulk of Cooper's estate was left to his nephew, <a name="cosubject_32548"></a><span class="headword">Sir Daniel Cooper</span>, first baronet  (1821&#150;1902), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>. The younger Daniel Cooper was also born at Bolton, Lancashire, on 1 July 1821, and he was the second son in the family of five sons and four daughters of his uncle's brother, Thomas Cooper, merchant, and his wife, Jane Ramsden. He emigrated to Sydney with his parents and then returned to London in 1835 to complete his education at University College School. Although he intended to become a lawyer, he abandoned his studies in 1841 as a result of ill health.<br>
<br>After a period with a Franco-American firm in Le Havre, Cooper joined his uncle's business in London in 1842. In the following year he became a partner in his brother-in-law's merchant house in Sydney, which he took over with his elder brother in 1848. He became sole proprietor of Cooper Brothers in 1852, which was by now one of the leading merchant houses in the city. Cooper prospered from the gold rush and owned considerable property in Sydney as well as extensive grazing lands. He was also a director of the Sydney Railway Company and of the Bank of New South Wales from 1847. He married Elizabeth Hill in 1846, and they had two sons and three daughters. His uncle's fortune and his own wealth made him a significant figure in New South Wales, where he became a leading Liberal member of the legislative council and assembly, serving as speaker between 1856 and 1860. In 1856 he started to construct Woolhara House, on the estate acquired by his uncle. He joined the senate of the University of Sydney in 1857, and was knighted in the same year.<br>
<br>Cooper returned permanently to England in 1861, and became much occupied with philanthropic activities. He gave generously to support the families of those killed in the Crimean War, and in the early 1860s he helped to organize relief funds for distressed textile-workers during the Lancashire cotton famine. Depicted as &#145;a little man&#151;serene, smiling and graceful&#146;, Cooper had a broad and pale forehead. &#145;Looking at that head one could swear its owner was a heavy subscriber to Bethal Unions and a victim of begging letters&#146;  (Martin, 452). In 1863 he was raised to the baronetcy for his public services during the Lancashire distress and took Woolhara as his title.<br>
<br>Cooper also served as agent-general for New South Wales in England, and he was a leading participant in the controversies over the operation of the wool market in the early 1870s. The colonial sheep farmers were at this time attempting to wrest control of the wool market from their London consignees, which brought Cooper into conflict with Dalgety, the largest of the London-based wool importers. Dalgety denounced Cooper as a &#145;little Sydney blaguard&#146;  (Dalgety to Nichols, 10 Aug 1871), who was &#145;thoroughly unscrupulous, untruthful and pertinacious&#146;  (Dalgety to Blackwood, 5 Oct 1871). Dalgety was considerably annoyed by suggestions that the brokers and merchants in London were robbing and exploiting the colonial growers, and he fumed that<blockquote>Never in the annals of Commerce of London had there been a more disgraceful and dastardly attack &hellip; on a respectable body of men as that made by Sir Daniel Cooper, who merited the contempt and scorn of every right minded man for his conduct.&hellip; Yet in the Colonies he appears to have gained the admiration and gratitude of the Squatters &hellip; by his mendacity and trickery. (Dalgety to secretary of the Melbourne chamber of commerce, 10 Aug 1871, Australian National University, archives of business and labour, N39/42)</blockquote>Dalgety and Cooper represented the change taking place in the operation of the wool market in the 1870s. Private partnerships such as Dalgety's firm faced increasing difficulties in securing sufficient credit to provide funds to the squatters in the colonies, and to cover the sale of wool in London. By contrast Cooper represented the Bank of New South Wales, which had access to credit on more favourable terms; he marked the incursion into the City of London of colonial banks and pastoral finance houses. As well as acting as the agent-general for New South Wales in London, in 1881 Cooper was chairman of the London committee of the Sydney International Exhibition. He was appointed KCMG in 1880 and GCMG in 1888. Sir Daniel Cooper died at his London home, 6 De Vere Gardens, Kensington, on 5 June 1902. He was survived by his wife.<br>
