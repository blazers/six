<span class="headword">Holland,  William</span>  (1837&#150;1895), <span class="occ">showman and music-hall and theatre entrepreneur</span>, was born on 26 December 1837 at 58 Newington Causeway, London, the son of alderman William Holland, linen draper and wholesale upholsterer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bayly. Though apprenticed to the family business, he was enamoured of amateur theatricals and left the trade while still young to promote minstrel shows, in which he played the interlocutor.<br>
<br>In 1866 in partnership with a publican uncle, Holland successfully revived Weston's music-hall in Holborn, a major venue fallen on hard times. He went into independent management in 1867 in the famous Canterbury music-hall in Lambeth, another ailing business rescued by the lavish refurbishments, aggressive publicity, and flamboyant self-promotion that were the trade marks of his career as &#145;the British Barnum&#146;. At the Canterbury he laid the stalls with expensive Brussels carpet, compounding the misgivings of friends by inviting the public to &#145;Come and spit on Billy Holland's thousand guinea carpet&#146;  (H. G. Hibbert, <span class="italic">Fifty Years of a Londoner's Life</span>, 1916, 57). Here in 1868 Holland signed the biggest star of the day, George Leybourne, &#145;Champagne Charlie&#146;, to an exclusive contract, obliging him to maintain the lordly and extravagant style of his hit song off as well as on stage, while Holland placarded London with details of his sensational salary. &#145;We are&#146;, declared Holland, &#145;living in an age of luxury&#146;  (&#145;Chat with William Holland&#146;, <span class="italic">The Era</span>, 6 Jan 1894), a luxury which he determined to extend to all classes, casting himself as &#145;the People's Caterer&#146;, and &#145;Emperor of Lambeth&#146;, an invocation of his personal hero, Napoleon III, whom he emulated in dress, manner, and carefully cultivated moustache.<br>
<br>In the 1870s Holland extended his entertainment empire to management of the Victoria and Surrey theatres and proprietorship of the North Woolwich Riverside Pleasure Gardens where his novel promotions included contests of trade skills for such as barmaids, postmen, and costers. &#145;The People's William&#146; was himself frequently part of the show, riding on Blondin's back on tightrope at one of his halls and making surprise appearances in pantomime at the Surrey. Famously generous, he was a prominent freemason and ubiquitous figure at professional benefits and dinners, accompanied by his confidant and business adviser, fat Joe Pope, former army surgeon. Holland provided private entertainments for the prince of Wales, but also held benefits for Newcastle workers on strike for the nine-hour day in 1871 and provided soup for London's unemployed in 1886. Among his equally sensational failures were bull-fights at the Agricultural Hall over Christmas 1869, when imported Spanish bulls proved too meek to fight and Holland lost &pound;7000 in three days&#151;a notable improvidence for the then president of the Music Hall Provident Fund. Later ventures included management of Wilton's and the Alhambra, circus and variety bills at Covent Garden Opera House, and schemes to convert the Great Eastern steamship into an entertainment complex. Though he escaped one process-server by balloon from the North Woolwich, Holland was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1876 and again in 1881. In his last major metropolitan venture he took over the Albert Palace in Battersea, joining with the RSPCA in sponsoring a 3 mile parade of London carthorses as publicity. When the Albert proved &#145;not too cashful&#146;  (H. Chance Newton, <span class="italic">Idols of the Halls</span>, 1975, 89), Holland moved in 1887 to the new frontier of mass entertainments, Blackpool. Despite the timidity of fellow directors, his enterprising management of the Winter Gardens (and a similar operation in Morecambe) achieved popular and financial success and he commissioned the town's new opera house. Holland drove himself hard and died at his home, 46 Park Road, Blackpool, on 29 December 1895, following a talent scouting trip to the USA, his personal finances reportedly in a mess. He was buried in Blackpool and survived by his wife Mary Matilda, (to whom he had been married for more than thirty years), a daughter Matilda (Minnie), and a son Louis, also in theatre management.<br>
<br>Though his bravura style was being superseded by the bureaucratic disciplines of the large corporation, Billy Holland's quasi-aristocratic largess and populist rhetoric of progress and plenty exemplified the confidence of liberal capitalism in an expanding modern leisure market.<br>
