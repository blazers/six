<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farren,  William</span>  (1754&#150;1795), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was, according to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, the son of a London tallow chandler. He was bound apprentice to a tinman, but possibly ran away and joined a party of players. Alternatively, a manuscript in the Folger Shakespeare Library suggests he was well brought up and placed in a banking office in Lombard Street. A conspicuous member of a spouting club, he was noticed by Richard Yates, who engaged him at Birmingham, where his presence can be authenticated from 1774. In the mid-1770s he began living with Mary Mansell, known as Mrs Mary Orton (1745/1748&#150;1820), an actress, with whom he had eight children, four of whom survived.<br>
<br>On 20 March 1775 Farren made his d&eacute;but at Drury Lane as Jason in Richard Glover's <span class="italic">Medea</span> for Mrs Yates's benefit, where his &#145;appearance and voice impressed the Audience with favourable ideas of his talents. The spirit he evinced, though rather uncouth, it was hoped experience would polish&#146;  (Haslewood, 124). He later commenced an engagement at Drury Lane, first appearing on the bills on 4 November 1775 as Stratocles in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>. &#145;His cast of parts&#146;, said the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, &#145;were in the second walk of acting, though he supported with applause all the first, and ever acted with sense and judgement&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 65, 1795, 528). His Horatio was highly regarded: &#145;He does not endeavour to make more of his situations in the scene than he ought; he observes a proper subordination&#146;  (Davies, 2.90). The <span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span> commented: &#145;His manner is particularly adapted to rigid, strong, and masculine parts in Tragedy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Theatrical Review</span>, 7 Oct 1783), but was less impressed by him in genteel comedy (he was the original Careless in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, 8 May 1777). Possibly dissatisfied with secondary roles, Farren left Drury Lane for Covent Garden, where he made his d&eacute;but on 21 May 1784 as Othello. He now took on more major parts, including Altamont (Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>) and Jaffeir (Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>). He played Lear for the first time on 6 May 1786, prompting Leigh to write:&#145;<i>he ne'er will rise beyond</i> a decent <i>Lear</i>&#146;  (Leigh, 19). He also continued to play secondary roles. His visits to the provinces were rare, although he played leading parts at Bristol (1778), Birmingham (1779), Manchester (1781, 1783), and Liverpool (1786). His only engagement at the Haymarket Theatre was in 1791. His last performance at Covent Garden was as Penius, in Colman's <span class="italic">Bonduca</span>, on 24 April 1795.<br>
<br>Genest called Farren a &#145;respectable actor&#146;  (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. stage</span>, 7.220), who latterly grew too fat for younger characters. According to <span class="italic">The Secret History of the Green Rooms</span>, Farren was:<blockquote>if not a first-rate actor, at least a respectable second-rate actor &hellip; He formerly pleased the eye both in countenance and person, but is now grown rather clumsy&#151;His voice is very powerful and capable of variation; and although he seems to have laboured to express his Author with great animation and beauty, yet his efforts have not extended beyond passive propriety &hellip; his passion too often makes him descend from the dignity of his character, by staring, and rolling his eyes, and suffering his face to redden with the heat of a testy welchman. (Haslewood, 128)</blockquote>Pasquin is particularly scathing:<blockquote>
<div>By much the most ardent among the assuming<br>
</div>
<div>By much most presumptuous amid the presuming;<br>
</div>
<div>Hear FARREN affright every muse from her station,<br>
</div>
<div>By unqualified rant, and extreme intonation.<br>
</div> (Pasquin, 67)</blockquote>A failing memory was noted as another of Farren's shortcomings in 1790.<br>
<br>Latterly Farren spent his summers at his house near Kingston, Surrey, indulging in his favourite sport of fishing. On one of these occasions he caught a chill, from which he died, at his London home, 85 Gower Street, on 9 May 1795, at the age of forty-one. He was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 15 May. His principal mourner was Percival Pott, a gentleman who had reputedly been rescued by the actor when attacked by thieves. An intimacy developed between them, and Farren persuaded Pott to move into his house. Partly through Pott's resources, the family lived in great splendour, and Pott continued to support them after Farren's death; one of the beneficiaries of his generosity was Farren's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9193/', "William Farren (1786&#150;1861)")</script>, who became a highly successful actor.<br>
