<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Menken,  Adah  Isaacs</span>  (1835?&#150;1868), <span class="occ">actress and poet</span>, is thought to have been born on 15 June 1835 in New Orleans. At various times in her life she produced different versions of her parentage, giving her father's name as James McCord, Richard Spencer, Ricardo La Fiertes (or Fuertes), and James Campbell. Her mother was stated to be either Creole or Jewish of Franco-Spanish descent. W. Mankowitz, in his &#145;biographic quest&#146; entitled <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span> (1982), has shown that her most likely maiden name was Ada Berthe Th&eacute;odore and that her father was probably a wheelwright, probably called Auguste Th&eacute;odore, a &#145;free man of colour&#146;, living in New Orleans, and that her mother was a native of Pensacola, possibly called Magdaleine Jean Louis Janneaux. She and her half-sister later appeared in a dancing act as &#145;The Sisters Theodore&#146;, which gives some credence to this conjecture. Further mystery surrounds her early life and, if the attribution of the name is correct, it is probable that she married a composer, W. H. Kneass, in Galveston, Texas, on 6 February 1855, during which year she was already giving readings from Shakespeare, advertised in the <span class="italic">Liberty Gazette</span>. &#145;Ada Theodore&#146; also published three poems and some liberationist pieces on the situation of women in that journal. On 23 November 1855 another poem, &#145;New Advertisement&#146;, written from Austin, proclaimed her wish to find a &#145;beau id&eacute;al&#146;. It is possible that this poem could have been seen by Alexander Isaac Menken, then a pit musician and conductor, from a wealthy Jewish Cincinnati dry goods family, who eventually married Ada on 3 April 1856 at Livingston, Polk, Texas. She then became Adah Isaacs (adding an &#145;h&#146; to her own and an &#145;s&#146; to her husband's name) Menken, under which name she performed on the stage for the rest of her life. Mr Kneass was apparently conveniently forgotten.<br>
<br>Adah Menken's first recorded stage appearance was with the amateur Crescent Dramatic Association of New Orleans in 1856. She was then taken on for leading parts by James S. Charles for his stock company, touring Texan towns. Poems and articles were also written for the <span class="italic">New Orleans Sunday Delta</span> and the <span class="italic">Cincinnati Israelite</span>, some dated in Hebrew, and Adah was accepted into the Cincinnati Jewish community. Meanwhile her husband had become her agent, and he booked her for Dayton, Ohio, in her own version of the Jack Sheppard story, <span class="italic">Sixteen-String Jack</span>, which was an immediate success, especially with the local militia. Adah had ambitions to try her luck in New York and, leaving Menken behind for ever, went there in 1859 to play Widow Cheerly in Andrew Cherry's <span class="italic">The Soldier's Daughter</span>. Here she met and married, thinking herself divorced by rabbinical diploma, on 3 September 1859, John Carmel Heenan, &#145;the Benicia Boy&#146;, a prizefighter also looking for public recognition. Scandal followed her when Alexander Menken announced that, although he was currently seeking a divorce, at the time of the Heenan marriage Adah was still his wife. Heenan left for an important contest in England and returned with another woman on his arm, Adah meanwhile having suffered a miscarriage. A further divorce took place in November 1861.<br>
<br>Menken consorted with the literati and toured Milwaukee, Detroit, Albany, and Chicago in <span class="italic">The Soldier's Daughter</span>, Douglas Jerrold's <span class="italic">Black-Eyed Susan</span>, and J. T. Haines's <span class="italic">The French Spy</span>, plays which she repeated throughout her life. Her greatest success everywhere, however, was as the hero of H. M. Milner's <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span>, based on Byron's poem, at the climax of which she appeared strapped to a running horse and clad to give the appearance of nakedness. Captain John B. Smith launched this play on 7 June 1861 at the Green Street Theatre, Albany, where it was enthusiastically received; the exposure of the actress's shapely body and the scandalized pleasure it evoked only enhanced the popularity of the piece. Her press manager at this time and for the rest of her life was Edwin James of the <span class="italic">New York Clipper</span>, whom she addressed as &#145;brother&#146; and to whom she wrote regularly. The play transferred to the Broadway Theatre, opening on 13 June. On 24 September 1862 she married again; her new husband was Robert Henry Newell, the literary editor of the New York <span class="italic">Sunday Mercury</span>, but she found that his expectations of her retirement to domestic bliss in Jersey City did not conform with her own, and she left for New York after a week. She then resumed her stage career in Baltimore, giving some anxiety to her manager through her Confederate leanings. But she had set her heart on appearances in California, which she hoped would lead to an engagement in London. <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span> was again sold out at the Opera House in San Francisco and in Sacramento; Newell was present and seeking reconciliation, and she was again surrounded by writers such as Mark Twain and Bret Harte. Adah then bought a brownstone house in New York, at 458 Seventh Avenue. James managed to arrange an engagement at Astley's Amphitheatre in London, though at a much lower salary than that to which Adah was by now accustomed, and she set sail for England on 3 April 1864, having in the meantime organized a divorce from Newell.<br>
<br>Adah Menken first settled in London at Bunyard's Private Hotel in Norfolk Street, but soon moved to a suite at the Westminster Palace Hotel, where she prepared for the opening night of <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span> on 3 October. Her appearance garnered mixed notices, but during the run (which lasted until December) she became accepted by bohemian society and held court at her &#145;literary salon&#146; at the hotel. Paris beckoned, and Menken departed, armed with introductions from Charles Fechter to Gautier and Alexandre Dumas <i>p&egrave;re</i> but no theatrical engagement eventuated. On her return to London a provincial tour was arranged, to Glasgow, Liverpool, and Leeds, of <span class="italic">The Children of the Sun</span>, a poor play written for her by the American actor John Brougham. By October 1865 she had another lover, &#145;Captain&#146; James Paul Barkley, a handsome, wealthy American addicted to gambling, whom she had probably met on the boat coming to England and whom she entertained in her house, 255 Brompton Road. When he fell ill in New York she returned there, and appeared again in <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span> at the Broadway Theatre with a guaranteed $12,000 for twenty-four performances. When she found herself pregnant, she married Barkley, on 19 August 1866. The marriage lasted for three days. Menken then departed again for Paris without her husband. There is no record of the birth, probably in November 1866, of their son, Louis Dudevant Victor Emmanuel, whose godmother was George Sand, and reports vary as to whether he died in that same year or was adopted by an English family and his name changed. Menken's stay in Paris was notorious both for her affair with Alexandre Dumas <i>p&egrave;re</i> and for her mute role in <span class="italic">The Pirates of the Savannah</span>. A disastrous visit to Vienna later in 1867 followed, where she was the victim of antisemitism, an account of which, since admitted to be fabricated, is contained in Samuel Edwards's (Gerson) <span class="italic">Queen of the Plaza</span> (1964). By the autumn Menken was in London pursuing the publication of a collection of her poems entitled <span class="italic">Infelicia</span>, dedicated to Dickens. A strange affair with Algernon Charles Swinburne soon began, and Menken is said to be the &#145;Dolorida&#146; in his poem of that name. <span class="italic">Mazeppa</span> was again put on at Sadler's Wells, the last performance being on 30 May 1868. Menken then accepted an offer to appear in Paris, preceded by a holiday at Le Havre, since she was depressed and exhausted by the London engagement, in the course of which she had been involved in a stage accident, and was probably already suffering from cancer. She became ill during rehearsals for <span class="italic">The Pirates</span> and died on 10 August 1868, attended by a rabbi and a devoted servant in a hotel in the rue Caumartin. She had insisted that the Orthodox embargo on a post-mortem be observed, and various rumours circulated as to the cause of her death&#151;tuberculosis, peritonitis, or cancer. She was buried in the Jewish section of the P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery but later transferred by Edwin James, with a donation from Barkley, to the cemetery at Montparnasse, where a stone was erected bearing her desired enigmatical inscription, &#145;Thou knowest&#146;.<br>
