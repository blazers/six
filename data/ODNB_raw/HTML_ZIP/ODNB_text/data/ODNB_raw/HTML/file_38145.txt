<span class="headword">Wolf,  Lucien</span>  (1857&#150;1930), <span class="occ">journalist and lobbyist</span>, was born on 20 January 1857 in London, the elder son of Edward Wolf, pipe manufacturer, and his wife, C&eacute;line (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Redlich). On his father's side Bohemian, on his mother's Viennese, Wolf may have spent his working life in London but it was critically informed throughout by his Jewish, central European roots. And not just socially. The central European revolutions of 1848, in which his father had participated and from which on their failure he had fled to Britain, remained the guiding force in Wolf's own political thinking. Economic and political liberalism combined with religious freedom and tolerance of the stranger were not only the forces which Wolf espoused as essential for general progress but were also the specific route by which minority groups such as the Jews could be emancipated, assimilated, and enabled to make the fullest contribution to society. For Wolf, Britain, the country of his father's asylum, was the model for this European, if not broader development  (Mowschowitch, &#145;Life&#146;).<br>
<br>These convictions persisted throughout Wolf's journalistic career, which began while he was still in his teens. Educated at the Ath&eacute;n&eacute;e Royal in Brussels as well as in Paris, he quickly developed an expertise in foreign affairs. Fluent in German and French and painstaking in his efforts to develop contacts in the chancelleries of Europe, he built up a formidable reputation from the 1890s onwards, particularly with the <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span>, to which he contributed a regular &#145;Foreign office bag&#146; column. He also wrote as Diplomaticus for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, for which he was later described as the foreign affairs spokesman for Lord Salisbury. His own boast that he was sometimes less an observer of foreign affairs than an instigator of them had a certain ring of truth: for instance, in 1898 he placed suggestions with Paul Lessar, a diplomat at Russia's London embassy, ostensibly approved by the foreign secretary, Lord Salisbury, for resolution of an incipient Anglo-Russian dispute over Manchuria. Wolf had his finger on the pulse of Europe's otherwise often very secretive and highly manipulative <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> diplomacy. And his articles were read in high places.<br>
<br>Ironically, it was this insider knowledge at a juncture when British foreign policy was moving in a radically new direction towards engagement with the European pre-1914 alliance system which also ensured Wolf's journalistic downfall. Entirely and very publicly out of sympathy with Whitehall's growing pro-Russian, anti-German orientation, Wolf found himself increasingly unwelcome in the corridors of power and suspected of being too close to the German interest. At the outbreak of the First World War the charge was much more forcefully taken up in the right-wing press with accusations that Wolf was actually in German pay. Less public insinuations also had him as a spy, leading to his investigation by the special branch. These charges proved unfounded, but too late for Wolf's journalistic career, his twenty-five years of service with <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> and <span class="italic">Daily Graphic</span> being rapidly terminated.<br>
<br>Paradoxically, this personal catastrophe triggered the most important and productive period in Wolf's life. He had always been closely involved in Anglo-Jewish life, most notably as editor from 1906 to 1908 of the <span class="italic">Jewish World</span>. But for several years before 1914 he had also been giving expert advice to the Conjoint Foreign Committee, a patrician-led, Anglo-Jewish pressure group whose remit, primarily through behind-the-scenes diplomatic intervention, was to combat antisemitism, particularly prevalent at this time in Russia and Romania. Anxiety about the number of Jews fleeing to Britain from these countries was also a powerful goad to the committee's activity, and was discussed in his article &#145;Anti-Semitism&#146; in the eleventh edition of <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1911). Now, in 1914, Wolf was effectively subsidized by the committee's two presidents, Claude Goldsmid Montefiore and David Lindo Alexander, to run the committee and to prepare for it an Anglo-Jewish foreign policy agenda for the expected peace conference.<br>
<br>Dependent on the goodwill of a British Foreign Office unwilling to intercede with its Russian ally in favour of Russian-Jewish emancipation, Wolf tried another tack. He proposed in 1916 that the British government declare in favour of Jewish settlement and colonization in Palestine. This was a rather odd proposal coming from Wolf. Its tenor was clearly Zionist. Yet Wolf, in Jewish circles, was known as much for virulently opposing Zionism as for his more general opposition to the Anglo-Russian entente. True, he had briefly given his personal support to Theodore Herzl's Zionist programme in the late 1890s and had also supported Israel Zangwill's efforts in 1905 to seek a territory&#151;not necessarily Palestine&#151;somewhere in the world, where fleeing Jews could be settled <i>en masse</i> under their own political jurisdiction. But when he had come face to face with some of the underlying ideological premises of the movement, particularly that assimilation was both incompatible with and contrary to the spirit of Jewish nationalism, Wolf became one of Zionism's most trenchant critics. His Palestine proposal of 1916 was thus primarily a clever subterfuge by which to gain the British government's ear and to bring it back to what he believed to be the central Jewish issue of the time, the security and well-being <i>in situ</i> of its eastern European masses. Ironically, the British government did go on to take up his suggestions on Palestine though now as advocated by genuine Zionists led by Chaim Weizmann. The result, in November 1917, was the Balfour declaration. Meanwhile Wolf's Conjoint Foreign Committee suffered censure and closure from the British Jewish board of deputies, the more democratic of its two parent bodies, for its opposition to the declaration.<br>
<br>Amazingly Wolf's position was actually strengthened early in 1918 with the creation of a new Joint Foreign Committee, this time with himself officially recognized as its foreign secretary. Not only was the Anglo-Jewish community unable to dispense with his expertise but in effect tacitly recognized his view that the Balfour declaration could not alone deal with the problem of eastern European Jewry. Wolf's reformulated peace agenda this time, notably influenced by his Russian adviser David Mowschowitch, included the proposal that Jews and other minorities in the newly envisaged post-imperial states of eastern Europe should be guaranteed rights of cultural autonomy as well as political citizenship. Throughout the Paris peace conference of 1919 Wolf laboured to have this formula recognized. A growing <i>rapprochement</i> between himself and members of the British conference delegation, most notably James Headlam-Morley, who sat on the key new states committee, ensured that Wolf played a&#151;perhaps the&#151;critical role behind the scenes in formulating minorities treaties. It was undoubtedly his finest hour.<br>
<br>Implementation was another matter. Wolf's last years were spent attempting to strengthen the juridical mechanisms by which the League of Nations might respond more rapidly and effectively to an ever increasing number of infractions of the treaties. He also laboured&#151;in vain&#151;to gain for minorities a direct right of appeal to the League secretariat. Even so, his diplomatic skills were sufficiently recognized that in 1925 he was called to Warsaw to act as intermediary in a dispute between Jewish parliamentary deputies and the Polish state. Dogged for years by almost complete blindness, Wolf was able to carry on working in this final decade through the support of his secretary, Margaret Kavanagh. From 1880 until her death in 1912 Wolf had been married to Frances Moses, daughter of Moses Moses of Maida Vale, London; they had four sons and three daughters. In 1923 he married Margaret. At the time of his death, in London on 23 August 1930, Wolf was due to succeed Fridjhof Nansen as president of the advisory committee of the League's high commission for refugees, a committee of which he had been a co-founder.<br>
<br>Wolf is remembered as a controversial figure in both Jewish and more general society. Disliked by many British establishment figures for daring to criticize British foreign policy, his telling critique of Zionism also brought him bitter enmity from those like Weizmann who accused him of defending the undemocratic interests of &#145;the grand dukes&#146; of which he supposedly was one (Wolf, 69; Weizmann, 199&#150;202). Neither accusation was correct. Wolf was very much his own man. He openly supported the radical Russian-Jewish socialist Bund during the revolution of 1905 against the advice of Lord Rothschild, and mortified many more in the Anglo-Jewish establishment by helping the self-consciously maverick Zangwill to create the Jewish Territorial Organization, ITO. Nor was Wolf actually a wealthy bigwig but rather a member of an up-and-coming Anglo-Jewish professional &eacute;lite which was making its own quite distinctive cultural mark on the late Victorian and Edwardian communal scene. His major contribution in this field was as co-founder in 1893 of the Jewish Historical Society of England, for which he wrote many articles and which locate him as the first serious exponent of Anglo-Jewish history. Many of these appeared posthumously in <span class="italic">Essays in Jewish History</span> (1934) accompanied by an unattributed memoir of Wolf, largely written by his long-time assistant, David Mowschowitch.<br>
