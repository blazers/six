<span class="headword">Pennington, Sir  Isaac</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1745, <em>d.</em> 1817), <span class="occ">physician and chemist</span>, was born at Longmore in Furness Fell, Lancashire, the son of Paul Pennington, the captain of a merchant ship, and baptized at Colton, Lancashire, on 17 December 1745. He attended Sedbergh grammar school, and then entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a sizar, on 12 August 1762. He became a Lupton scholar on 4 November 1766. He went out as thirteenth wrangler in 1767, one of his examiners being Richard Watson, whom he succeeded as professor of chemistry. He was admitted as a fellow of St John's on 22 March 1768, and continued in this capacity until his death. He was admitted to the faculty fellowship in medicine on 18 October 1775, and thus retained his fellowship; he was president from 1787 to 1802. He graduated MA in 1770, and MD in 1777. He became the professor of chemistry in 1773, and in 1793 resigned, and was appointed regius professor of physic, a post he held until 1813. He was physician to Addenbrooke's Hospital from 1785 until 1817, and was knighted in 1796. He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 29 March 1779, and delivered the Harveian oration in 1783; this remained unpublished. Pennington made no attempt to introduce long overdue reforms to the teaching of medicine in Cambridge, and is perhaps mostly remembered for being challenged to a duel by a colleague, Busick Harwood. It appears that on the pair meeting one morning Pennington said &#145;Good morning, Sir, B. U. Sick?&#146;, to which Harwood is said to have replied &#145;Sir? I, Sick? I was never better in my life&#146;  (Towers, 74). Pennington died at his house in Bridge Street, Cambridge, on 3 February 1817, and is commemorated by a tablet in the chapel of St John's. He never married, and in his will, read on 11 March 1817, he appointed the Revd James Wood (master), the Revd Laurence Palk Baker (fellow), and the Revd Charles Blick (fellow and bursar), as his executors. He bequeathed his property in St Sepulchre's parish, Cambridge, to the master&#151;this included his house in Bridge Street. He made a number of small legacies to servants and friends, but bequeathed the residue of his estate to the college; this included a small anatomical collection formed by the physician Thomas Lawrence. He also founded a number of exhibitions in the college, with a preference to candidates from Hawkshead and Colton near his birthplace in Lancashire.<br>
