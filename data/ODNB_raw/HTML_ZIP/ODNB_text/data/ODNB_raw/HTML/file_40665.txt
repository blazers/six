<span class="headword">Wall,  Max</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Maxwell George Lorimer]</span>  (1908&#150;1990), <span class="occ">comedian and actor</span>, was born on 12 March 1908 at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, Brixton Road, Brixton, London, the second of the three children, all sons, of John Gillespie Lorimer (<i>d</i>. 1922), music-hall artiste, formerly of Forres, Scotland, and his wife, Maud Clara, dancer and singer, daughter of William and Maud Mitchison of Newcastle upon Tyne, both music-hall entertainers. He had sporadic schooling of a disjointed kind, being brought up in the music-hall theatre by his parents, who were known as Jack Lorimer and Stella Stahl. He was first taken on stage, in a kilt, at the age of two. Later he changed his name to Max Wall by deed poll.<br>
<br>After the break up of his parents' marriage and the death of his father, Max Wall began his long show-business career. At the age of fourteen he made his stage d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Mother Goose</span> (1922), and, much encouraged by his stepfather, Harry Wallace&#151;from whom he took his stage surname&#151;he soon became a fully-fledged professional entertainer, concentrating on eccentric dance routines and funny walks. He made his first London appearance in 1925 at the London Lyceum in <span class="italic">The London Revue</span>. Thereafter he appeared in several musical comedies and revues, including C. B. Cochran's <span class="italic">One Dam Thing After Another</span> (1927), and he appeared in the 1930 and 1950 royal variety performances. He now established himself as a prominent music-hall artiste, variously billed as &#145;the boy with the obedient feet&#146; or &#145;Max Wall and his independent legs&#146;. He served in the Royal Air Force from 1941 to 1943, when he was invalided out on account of &#145;anxiety neurosis&#146;, and returned to the music hall stage.<br>
<br>With his inventive patter, Wall also enjoyed radio success, notably in <span class="italic">Hoopla!</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Our Shed</span> (in which he popularized the character of Humphrey, 1946), and <span class="italic">Petticoat Lane</span> (1949). He next had a major success as Hines in the musical <span class="italic">The Pajama Game</span> (1955), and soon starred in his first television series, <span class="italic">The Max Wall Show</span> (1956). He had also perfected his role as Professor Wallofski, a weird spidery figure of a musical clown, clad in black tights, straggling wig, a short dishevelled jacket, and monstrously huge boots. His idols were the clown Grock and Groucho Marx.<br>
<br>By now the old variety theatre was in decline, and, with domestic problems also taking some toll, Wall had a lean period, during which he mainly played dates in northern clubland. In 1966 his mordant style found fresh opportunities on the legitimate stage, first as P&egrave;re Ubu in Ian Cuthbertson's adaptation of <span class="italic">Ubu Roi</span> (1966), and then, <i>inter alia</i>, in Arnold Wesker's <span class="italic">The Old Ones</span> (1972), as Archie Rice in John Osborne's <span class="italic">The Entertainer</span> (1974), and in Samuel Beckett's <span class="italic">Krapp's Last Tape</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Waiting for Godot</span> (1980). He also appeared, in 1973, in <span class="italic">Cockie!</span>, a musical version of C. B. Cochran's life, and the <span class="italic">International Herald Tribune</span> said he was &#145;quite simply, the funniest comedian in the world&#146;. He acted in several films, for instance as Flintwich in <span class="italic">Little Dorrit</span> (1987).<br>
<br>In 1974 Wall first produced what was to become a famous one-man show with songs, <span class="italic">Aspects of Max Wall</span>. In his later years he became something of a cult entertainer and in 1975 published his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Fool on the Hill</span>. He was a fluent mime, hilarious and eccentric dancer, competent musician, and an acidic stand-up comedian. His stage persona had an air of melancholy, even of cynicism, and his countenance was clown-like, with glaring eyes, a prominent nose, and leering mouth.<br>
<br>Following an unstable upbringing, Wall married, in 1942, Marion Ethel (Pola) Pollachek, dancer, the divorced wife of Thomas Patrick Charles and daughter of Alexander Pollachek, mechanical engineer, who ran a sponge rubber business in Islington. They had four sons and one daughter. The marriage was dissolved, with colourful attendant publicity, in 1956, and Wall became estranged from his family. In the same year he married a beauty queen, Jennifer Chimes, of north Staffordshire, daughter of John William Schumacher, master plumber. That marriage was dissolved in 1969, and he had a third marriage, to Christine Clements, in 1970, which was dissolved in 1972.<br>
<br>Max Wall rarely sought the camaraderie of show business in his later years, and, despite considerable wealth, lived almost as a recluse in a bedsitting room in south London. He fractured his skull in a fall in Simpson's in the Strand, a London restaurant, on 22 May 1990, and was pronounced dead on arrival at the Westminster Hospital. A celebration of his life was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, on 9 August 1990.<br>
