<span class="headword">Hill,  Alexander</span>  (1785&#150;1867), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and theologian</span>, was born at St Andrews, Fife, on 19 July 1785, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13274/', "George Hill (1750&#150;1819)")</script>, principal of St Mary's College, and his wife, Harriet Scott. He studied at the university of his native city, and graduated in September 1804. He was licensed as a preacher in 1806; for nine years afterwards he travelled in England and abroad, acting as tutor to a relative and pursuing his own studies, especially in the classics. In 1815 he was ordained as minister of Colmonell in Ayrshire; in June 1816 he was translated to the neighbouring parish of Dailly, where he remained for twenty-five years. He graduated DD at St Andrews in 1828. He married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1874), only daughter of Major Crawford of the East India Company, of Newfield; they had nine children.<br>
<br>In 1840 Hill was appointed professor of divinity at the University of Glasgow; one of the competitors for the chair was Thomas Chalmers. Hill was an undistinguished rural clergyman, whose only significant theological publication was an edition of his father's <span class="italic">Lectures in Divinity</span> (1825); it was clear that his only real credential for the post was his descent from the impeccably moderate family which had dominated the politics of early nineteenth-century St Andrews. His victory humiliated the much better qualified Chalmers and fuelled the rivalry between the moderate and evangelical wings of the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Hill was one of several moderates whose good character helped rebuild respect for the church after the Disruption; his good judgement and kind heart made him popular with both his parishioners and his students. While his theological views remained essentially those of his father, he expressed them with greater evangelical enthusiasm. He was a hearty participant in services and a contemporary described his sermons as &#145;instinct with life&#146; and breathing &#145;the spirit of Christianity&#146;. His delivery was probably enhanced by his appearance: tall and thin, Hill had &#145;prominent and expressive&#146; features  (Smith, 368).<br>
<br>After an unsuccessful candidature for the moderatorship of the general assembly in 1840, Hill was elected to the post in 1845, in the wake of the Disruption of 1843. He became an important figure in the general assembly, founding an association for increasing the livings of disadvantaged clergy and assisting with other charitable schemes. He was also the author of several pastoral and devotional works, including <span class="italic">A Book of Family Prayers</span> (1837). He resigned his chair in November 1862, and died at his home, 24 Hillington Square, Ayr, on 27 January 1867.<br>
