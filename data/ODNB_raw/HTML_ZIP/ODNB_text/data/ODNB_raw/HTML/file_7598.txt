<span class="headword">Dick, Sir  William, of Braid</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">merchant and financier</span>, was the only son of John Dick, proprietor in Orkney and an Edinburgh town councillor in 1592&#150;3. Nothing is known of his early life. On 15 June 1603 he married Elizabeth, sister of the wealthy Edinburgh merchant Harry Morison; they had at least seven children: John (<i>b</i>. 1604&times;7), Margaret (<i>bap</i>. 1608), Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1609), Andrew (later Sir Andrew Dick of Craighouse), Alexander, Lewis (<i>b</i>. 1619, <i>d</i>. before 1650), and William. By right of his father, on 28 March 1604 Dick became a burgess and guild brother. In 1609 he appeared in the records of Edinburgh council as witness to a case of kidnapping. Two years later he was elected for the first time to the town council, where he sat a further fifteen times, including four occasions as bailie, once as both treasurer and dean of guild, and twice as provost.<br>
<br>In the space of thirty years Dick rose from a &#145;junior player&#146;  (Brown, 21) in Edinburgh mercantile circles to a position of &#145;vast wealth&#146;, incomparable to that of the rest of the mercantile population of Scotland  (Dingwall, 18). By 1637 Dick alone was responsible for 4 per cent of the burgh's tax burden. His extraordinary wealth was founded on a variety of entrepreneurial activities. These included an investment of 150,000 merks in coal and salt works, herring works at Dunbar worth 60,000 merks, and a soap manufactory valued at 30,000 merks. His business interests were so extensive that by the 1630s Dick operated through a number of factors based in London, Paris, and Dieppe. His son Lewis later seems to have acted for his father in Paris, Bordeaux, and Rouen.<br>
<br>Within Edinburgh, Dick became a proprietor of some significance, renting out five properties with a total annual income of &pound;1122 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. Scots in 1635&#151;the highest rental in a town where the average was about &pound;80. Dick's own house in Kintore's Close was certainly one of the most expensive rentals in Edinburgh, costing him &pound;500 per annum. His business appears to have been conducted from a forebooth owned by Robert Glen, opposite the custom house at the top of the West Bow. Outside Edinburgh, Dick had interests in Caithness, Aberdeenshire, Moray, North Berwick in Haddingtonshire, Fife, and Orkney, either by directly holding land or through wadsetting. In 1631 he bought Braid in the sheriffdom of Edinburgh from David McCall and John Cant. It cost him &pound;20,000, but by 1642 the estate was valued at &pound;73,000.<br>
<br>As Dick's fortune increased he became involved in moneylending. When James VI and I visited Scotland in 1617 Dick advanced &pound;15,000 sterling for the king's expenses. He lent James Hamilton, second marquess of Hamilton, funds to facilitate the smooth passage of the king's legislation in the parliament of 1621, and his son and namesake, the third marquess, money for an unsuccessful military campaign in Germany in 1631. In 1624 Dick and a number of other merchants were examined by the Scottish privy council for charging exorbitant rates of interest, but this seems to have been only a temporary setback: his financial services for merchants and landowners alike seem to have placed him at the pinnacle of an increasingly sophisticated system of credit.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Dick's political stature also grew. During the 1630s he sat on a number of committees affiliated to Edinburgh town council. All these positions relied not only on the personal wealth of the individual in office, but also on his business and accounting skills. In time Dick's political influence extended beyond Edinburgh, involving six appearances on the convention of royal burghs. Although in April 1621 he had refused to attend communion tables where recipients were kneeling, he was not among the capital's leading nonconformists, but in December 1637 he was one of three town councillors who met those opposing royal policy, assuring them of the council's support. When the national covenant was signed in February 1638 Dick replaced the royalist Sir John Hay as provost, and he remained in that office in the critical months through to 1640. He met the king's commissioner, the marquess of Hamilton, but refused to publish the king's proclamation which offered to pardon any &#145;rebels&#146; who renounced the covenant, and according to Archibald Johnston of Wariston he was responsible for collecting voluntary contributions of money, gold, and silver from Edinburgh inhabitants. In March 1639 Dick lent 20,000 merks to the covenanters, with the political community as a whole acting as surety. In May, July, and August he sat on the commissions which co-ordinated Scotland's military action against Charles I and controlled the agenda for the parliament dissolved by John Stewart, earl of Traquair. He also expended &pound;15,000 sterling on unspecified costs of the parliament, as he did again in 1641, when Charles attended in person. It was perhaps as part of the king's efforts to secure both favour and financial resources that Dick, like the current provost John Smith, was knighted, probably in December 1641.<br>
<br>If so, Charles was to be disappointed: through the 1640s Dick continued to devote time and money to the covenanter cause. In 1644 he became a member of the committee of estates instituted to continue the work of parliament during its dissolution and served on the committees for money and for army magazines. In July that year he was, along with other Edinburgh town councillors, a commissioner for matters pertaining to the solemn league and covenant, signed in 1643 by the parliaments of Scotland and England. He also had local responsibilities as a commissioner for war in the sheriffdoms of Edinburgh, Haddington, and Linlithgow. The result, claimed Hugo Arnot in his <span class="italic">History of Edinburgh</span> (1779), was that having originally &#145;flattered his vanity&#146; by making Dick provost, the covenanters &#145;drained him of large sums, till, in the end, he died a beggar&#146;  (121&#150;2). His disbursements during &#145;the late troubles of Church and State&#146; cannot be accurately calculated, but as certainly resulted in Dick's &#145;irrevocable ruine&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 23116, fols. 49&#150;50). The collapse of the Scottish credit system in the 1640s meant that his loan to the covenanters could not be repaid, while his own debts to the town council amounted to 26,000 merks in 1643. By 1647 he was forced to ask that some of those debts be discharged on account of them being &#145;ane voluntar died for the good of this Cittie&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Edinburgh Records</span>, 1642&#150;55, 120). Although Dick was granted the tack for the collection of the wine excise (shared with Archibald Campbell, first marquess of Argyll) and part of the &#145;brotherly assistance&#146; from the English parliament (never fully paid), parliament acknowledged in 1648 that some &#145;sure and solide course&#146; for Dick's reimbursement had to be found, and in May 1649 he complained that he was still disappointed &#145;of publict payment in Scotland and England&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, vol. 6, pt 2, 45, 360).<br>
<br>The degree and effect of Dick's financial difficulties at this point is difficult to gauge. He sat on the committee of estates numerous times between 1649 and 1651 and managed to find &pound;10,000 sterling in response to Charles II's arrival in Scotland in 1650. When Oliver Cromwell occupied Edinburgh in October 1652 Dick led the delegation to greet him. However, this is the last year in which he appears in Edinburgh records, and it seems that within a few months he had departed for England to plead his cause in London. His finances were investigated by a committee at Whitehall in 1653, but a mere &pound;1000 sterling was paid out to him by parliament that September. He apparently continued petitioning until he died in December 1655 at his Westminster lodgings. Contrary to popular belief, he was buried in the plot in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh, which he had purchased fifteen years earlier.<br>
<br>Dick's political prominence and the complexity of his financial dealings ensured that his affairs were not easily wound up. <span class="italic">The Lamentable Estate and Distressed Case of Sir William Dick</span> (1657) printed correspondence from the mid-1640s illustrating his contribution to the war effort as well as striking woodcuts of Dick as a notable public figure on whom many people of lesser rank relied. The preface suggests that it was circulated in London; the text indicates that sympathetic presbyterians, along with the Scottish community there, were the intended audience. The pamphlet states that Dick was owed over &pound;64,000, but a petition made by his son in 1661 claimed that the crown alone owed him &pound;160,850 sterling. His testament was registered three times, in March 1681, September 1686, and July 1691. Years after Dick's death his heirs were still struggling to gain repayment. In December 1669 his grandson was given immunity from processes against him on account of Dick's debts. In March 1707 William Dick, ensign, petitioned parliament to reclaim the &pound;36,803 5<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. still owed by the public purse. It was William's assertion that various &#145;noble and worthy persons&#146; collectively owed his grandfather a further 900,000 merks  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, 11, appx, 136&#150;7), which were now irredeemable.<br>
