<span class="headword">Stanley,  Hans</span>  (1721&#150;1780), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 23 September 1721 at Paultons, near Romsey, Hampshire, and was baptized at Holyrood in Southampton the following month. He was the only son of George Stanley (<i>d</i>. 1734) and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1764), the elder daughter and coheir of the eminent physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25730/', "Sir Hans Sloane (1660&#150;1753)")</script>. His family was originally engaged in trade, but his parents' marriage in 1719 brought part of Sloane's Chelsea estate into the Stanley family. On 31 January 1734 his father committed suicide and his mother was left to bring up Stanley and his three sisters on her own. Two of his sisters later made political marriages: Anne (<i>d</i>. 1803) married Welbore Ellis (1713&#150;1802), and Sarah married Christopher D'Oyly (<i>c</i>.1717&#150;1795).<br>
<br>After being educated in Hackney and Switzerland, Stanley sought a political career, but he was restless and easily diverted into literary pursuits. He was returned as member of parliament for St Albans at a by-election on 11 February 1743, and sat for the constituency until the dissolution in 1747. He was admitted as a burgess at Southampton in 1747 with a view to establishing a political interest there, but he had no place in the next parliament, and for a time considered abandoning parliamentary life for diplomacy. He travelled frequently in France, and resided for two years in Paris, where he studied the law of nations. At the general election of 1754 he achieved his ambition at Southampton, which he then represented continuously until his death.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1757 Stanley was appointed a lord of the Admiralty and became one of Newcastle's following. Hearing from Lord Temple of Pitt's good opinion of him, he wrote to Pitt on 18 April 1761 to set out his claims to employment should peace negotiations be opened with France. Pitt enlisted his services, &#145;from opinion of his abilities&#146;. Stanley set out for Calais on 24 May 1761, and on 4 June arrived at Paris as charg&eacute; d'affaires. He remained there until 20 September, when it became clear that the mission had failed, and he then returned home. Charles Jenkinson, then under-secretary of state, described one of his reports disapprovingly as &#145;the first despatch in which I ever saw metaphysical reasoning&#146;, but Carlyle later praised them, in his <span class="italic">History of Frederick of Prussia</span> (1858&#150;65), as &#145;the liveliest reading one almost anywhere meets with in that kind&#146;. Stanley, adds Carlyle, was &#145;a lively, clear-sighted person, of whom I could never hear elsewhere&#146;  (ibid., 6.204&#150;5). Stanley was disappointed at not being trusted with the conduct of the negotiations when they were renewed in 1762, but he wrote the duke of Bedford a handsome letter on their success, and, though numbered at this time among Pitt's followers, defended the peace in the House of Commons on 9 December 1762 with &#145;spirit, sense, and cleverness&#146;. Pitt paid him &#145;the highest compliments imaginable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.168).<br>
<br>Stanley was created a privy councillor on 26 November 1762. In 1763 George Grenville, the new prime minister, offered him a lordship of the Treasury, but he declined, and in a spirited letter complained of the neglect of his talents. Hearing in July 1764 of the impending death of Lord Holmes, who was governor of the Isle of Wight and constable of Carisbrook Castle, he solicited and obtained this post, much to the annoyance of Lord Carnarvon, the lord lieutenant, who promptly resigned. Lady Hervey described the governorship as &#145;a very honourable, very convenient employment for him, and also very lucrative&#146;, and Stanley was reportedly &#145;very happy with his new government&#146;, which he hoped to use to build up a personal interest in the island  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Lepel</span>, 307). He built Steephill Cottage, on the site of the present castle, near Ventnor, in 1770 at considerable expense, and he entertained there several foreign ambassadors.<br>
<br>In July 1766 Pitt appointed Stanley ambassador-extraordinary to Russia, despite his declaration that &#145;nothing can be further from the plan of life I had proposed to myself, or from my wishes&#146; than any political or diplomatic career  (<span class="italic">Grenville Papers</span>, 3.284&#150;5). He was instructed to proceed to St Petersburg by way of Berlin, with the object of making a &#145;triple defensive alliance&#146; of Great Britain, Russia, and Prussia. The appointment was hastily made without the knowledge of Conway, then leading the House of Commons, without any intimation to Macartney, the ambassador at St Petersburg, and without consultation with Sir Andrew Mitchell, the British representative at Berlin. However, before Stanley left England the government's overtures were coldly received by Frederick of Prussia, and he never took up the appointment. When on 24 March 1767 Grenville made a strong attack on Chatham for his magnificent plans for special embassies, and mentioned this case, Stanley, &#145;a very warm man, retorted with vigour&#146; as he had acted &#145;with singular honour&#146; in waiving his right to the appointment  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 2.438&#150;9).<br>
<br>Stanley had previously given strong support to Grenville, both in parliament and in local politics, but he lost his office at the Admiralty board when Rockingham took over the premiership in 1765. He resumed his career under Pitt in 1766, when he was appointed cofferer of the household, an office which he temporarily vacated in 1774, but resumed in 1776 and held until his death. He had meanwhile resigned his post of governor of the Isle of Wight, but was reappointed to that office also in 1776. Afterwards the post was conferred upon him for life, an act without precedent at the time, and &#145;it was said with an additional pension&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals of Horace Walpole</span>, 1.327, 2.362). In November 1768 he seconded the address to the king on behalf of the Grafton administration. For the rest of his life he supported the administration of the day, speaking often in the house on a variety of topics, repeatedly opposing the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> and supporting the American War of Independence, but he made little impression on members or on the reporters. The king appreciated &#145;his zealous support on all occasions&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.149), but he received no further preferment.<br>
<br>Early in January 1780 Stanley paid a visit to Earl Spencer at Althorp. On the morning of 12 January he cut his throat with a penknife in the woods, and died before assistance could be obtained.<br>
<br>Stanley's abilities were unquestioned, and his character was highly respected. Lady Hervey, who knew him well, called him &#145;a very ingenious, sensible, knowing, conversable, and, what is still better, a worthy, honest, valuable man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Mary Lepel</span>, 204). However, he was awkward in appearance, ungracious in manners, and eccentric in his habits. He never laughed, and his speech was described by Madame du Deffand as slow and cold without action, and as pompous without weight. A bachelor, with &#145;a large house in Privy Gardens, joining to Lord Loudoun's&#146;, and with the country residences of Paultons, which he inherited from his father, and Steephill, which he built at Ventnor, he spent most of his time away from them, &#145;and when at home in town commonly dined at an hotel&#146;. He inherited from his mother her share in the Sloane property at Chelsea. In his will he made provision for his illegitimate son, then at sea, but the estate of Paultons passed, subject to the life interest of Stanley's sisters, to a cousin, Hans Sloane (1739&#150;1827), the nephew of Sir Hans Sloane. Stanley was one of the trustees for the collection of Sir Hans, and was until his death a family trustee of the British Museum.<br>
<br>Stanley left in manuscript various works, including a defence, written in Ciceronian Latin, of the English seizure of the French ships previous to the declaration of war. A poem of his in three cantos was imitated from Dryden's &#145;Fables&#146;, and at the time of his death he was engaged in translating Pindar. Dr Joseph Warton praised his knowledge of modern and ancient Greek, stating that he maintained a learned correspondence with the Abb&eacute; Barthelemy of Paris on the origin of Chaucer's &#145;Palamon and Arcite&#146;. He was an intimate friend of Helvetius, much to the discontent of Gibbon, who complained in February 1763 of the excessive admiration enjoyed by Stanley in French society; and he was a pallbearer at Garrick's funeral.<br>
