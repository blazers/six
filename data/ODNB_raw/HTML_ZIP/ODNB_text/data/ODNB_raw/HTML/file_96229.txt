<span class="headword">Davie,  Michael</span>  (1924&#150;2005), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born at Belhaven, Cranleigh, Surrey, on 15 January 1924, the second son and youngest of three children of Russell Davie, head of a stock-jobbing firm in the City of London, and his wife, Harriet Selina Hatton, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Browne. He went to Haileybury College, where he appeared in the cricket eleven with Alan Ross, the poet, whom he was later to appoint as cricket correspondent of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. He spent a year at Merton College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner reading English under Edmund Blunden, before following his elder brother Peter into the Royal Navy, serving the last two years of the Second World War in the Pacific. He returned to Merton in 1946, changing to study history.<br>
<br>Davie's tutor at Haileybury, Martin Wight (later famous as an international relations scholar), passed on to David Astor, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>'s new editor, a letter Davie had sent him about a holiday at Sandwich, in Kent. Astor was so impressed by the undergraduate's writing that he dined him at Boodle's and surprisingly offered him the post of diplomatic correspondent. Davie had to turn the offer down because he had not completed his course, but, having graduated with a second-class degree in modern history, he joined the paper in 1949&#151;this time in the equally surprising role of religious correspondent&#151;after a short training spell on the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span>. Religious correspondent was apparently the only position the news editor had available. Davie, though describing himself as a &#145;middle-stump Anglican&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>), was not drawn to the subject, especially after being lectured at Cliveden on the virtues of Christian Science by the editor's mother, the redoubtable Nancy Astor. On 8 November 1954 he married Mollie Robin Atherton, the 24-year-old daughter of Guy Atherton. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>As sports editor in the late 1950s, in partnership with Christopher Brasher, the former Olympic athlete, Davie created a new form of sports journalism for which he recruited unlikely contributors, such as the Oxford dons A. J. Ayer and John Sparrow. He demanded a quality of writing on sport that matched that on the literary and arts pages. He also persuaded current players, such as the footballer George Eastham, to file a report after a match from the dressing-room, which had not been done before. He was fanatical about cricket and used to slip away from the office to watch Len Hutton or Gary Sobers batting. On one memorable occasion he persuaded Groucho Marx to accompany him to Lord's; &#145;It's great&#146;, Marx is reputed to have replied when Davie asked if he was enjoying himself, &#145;When does it start?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). He covered the Melbourne Olympics of 1956 and went with the England cricket team on their Australian tour in 1959&#150;60. He later wrote a book, <span class="italic">Anglo-Australian Attitudes</span> (2000).<br>
<br>After a brief spell in Washington, Davie next became news editor and earned the respect of reporters by showing a talent for handling both them and their copy. Two of his injunctions became famous: he sent back one over-excited story with the comment &#145;Not dull enough&#146; and always insisted &#145;If necessary, cut the facts, never the jokes&#146;  (personal knowledge). Following his American heroes, H. L. Mencken and A. J. Liebling, he regarded the title of &#145;reporter&#146; as the highest a paper could bestow. His authority rested partly on his easygoing personality, but also on his own graceful style of writing&#151;a grace that disguised a sharp cutting edge. Astor's <span class="italic">Observer</span> was characterized by the brilliant writing of journalists like Patrick O'Donovan, John Gale, Kenneth Tynan, and Gavin Young, and Davie played an important role in finding talent to maintain that tradition.<br>
<br>Astor chose Davie as launch editor of the colour magazine in 1964, where he worked closely with his friend Anthony Sampson; Astor then brought him back to the main paper as his deputy. Davie, however, torn between writing and editing, took every opportunity to go on reporting assignments. He was fascinated by American politics, especially by the Kennedy family, and wrote some highly regarded pieces on their so-called &#145;Camelot court&#146;. A book about President Lyndon Johnson (1966) was much admired by American journalists. Richard Nixon was another favourite subject and later he followed the twists and turns of the Watergate saga.<br>
<br>In the mid-1960s Davie looked like Astor's inevitable successor. In 1969, however, when his first marriage broke up, he disappeared for several weeks, infuriating Astor, at whose behest he gave up his executive role and turned fully to writing. He began a new column on the newspaper's back page called &#145;Notebook&#146;, in which he displayed his wide range of interests and his fluency&#151;authoritative and gossipy at the same time. A former colleague said: &#145;His prime gift was for concentration &hellip; he was a spectator of acute talent&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). He obtained exclusive stories about cabinet committees as well as a rare interview with P. G. Wodehouse, who talked proudly of a try he had scored for Dulwich College against Haileybury in 1899. He was named journalist of the year in 1976. His second book, <span class="italic">California: the Vanishing Dream</span>, was published in 1972, and he had a big publishing success by editing Evelyn Waugh's waspish diaries (1973&#150;6), which were serialized in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> then the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. Meanwhile on 6 September 1975 he married Anne Katharine Chisholm, a 35-year-old journalist and author whom he had met through <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. She was the daughter of Archibald Hugh Tennent Chisholm, oil company executive and former editor of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, and the granddaughter of Hugh Chisholm, editor of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span>. They adopted one son.<br>
<br>As well as America, Davie always had a special affection for Australia, where his first wife came from, and in 1977 he accepted an offer to join <span class="italic">The Age</span> in Melbourne as an associate editor, becoming editor from 1979 to 1981. He was remembered there for his pursuit of investigative stories and campaigns, for persuading prominent Australian authors to write for the newspaper, and for promoting young journalists, especially women. In 1981 he returned to England and to <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, where he resumed his &#145;Notebook&#146; column, mixing this with his book writing; his account of the <i>Titanic</i> appeared in 1986. He retired from the paper in 1987, the year in which he published, with his son Simon, the <span class="italic">Faber Book of Cricket</span>. He then produced, with his second wife, his most successful book, <span class="italic">Beaverbrook: a Life</span> (1992), which won high critical praise. He had been fascinated by the legendary press lord ever since Beaverbrook had summoned him to his villa in the south of France in 1956 to offer him a job, impressed by an article he had written for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> about Marilyn Monroe.<br>
<br>Michael Davie was one of the most brilliant journalists of his generation. Some of his admirers believed that his equal facility at writing and editing may have prevented him reaching the professional heights that his talents deserved; others put this down to a natural diffidence. In any event, he was not a man to harbour regrets. He had great charm and modesty and was always, with his life long alertness for news and gossip, the best of company. He was described by a colleague as &#145;a quintessential Englishman &hellip; with his matinee idol good looks and faultless public school accent and manners &hellip; he would have looked completely at home at a 1930s country house party&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). He died at his home, Chaucer Cottage, in Ewelme, Oxfordshire, on 6 December 2005, following a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Anne, and the three children of his first marriage, his adopted son having predeceased him.<br>
