<span class="headword">Wildy,  (Norman) Peter Leete</span>  (1920&#150;1987), <span class="occ">virologist</span>, was born on 31 March 1920 at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, the only child of Eric Lawrence Wildy (1890&#150;1973), electrical engineer, and Gwendolen Leete (1890&#150;1982). He was educated at Eastbourne College and then went on to study medicine at Cambridge University and St Thomas's Hospital medical school in London. He qualified MRCS, LRCP (1944) and MB, BChir (1948). In 1945 he married Joan Audrey Kenion, daughter of Geoffrey Cadwalladwr Kenion (1881&#150;1945), tea planter, and Beatrice Aitcheson Pyper (1884&#150;1973); they had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1945 to 1947 Wildy served in the Royal Army Medical Corps in India, Egypt, and west Africa, before returning to a fellowship at St Thomas's Hospital medical school. Appointed to a lectureship there in bacteriology in 1952, he soon became interested in the rapidly growing field of virology and went to study with Sir MacFarlane Burnet at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne, at that time one of the great centres for virology. It was there that he started work on herpes, which was to be his major research interest for the remainder of his career. He continued this work on returning to St Thomas's and was appointed senior lecturer in bacteriology in 1957. Next he went to Cambridge, and then to Glasgow, where with Michael Stoker as director he created the Medical Research Council's new Experimental Virus Research Unit. Wildy was assistant director of the unit from 1959 to 1963.<br>
<br>However, it was in the short stay in Cambridge that Wildy established his name among virologists worldwide. With Sydney Brenner and Bob Horne, at that time the doyen of electron microscopists, he applied the technique of negative staining to the study of viruses. For the first time some of the structural details, and not just their outlines, could be seen. The interest created by this work led Wildy into virus classification, and his paper &#145;What's in a virus name?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 29 Jan 1966, 450&#150;54), with Adrian Gibbs, Bryan Harrison, and Douglas Watson, set out a logical scheme for classifying viruses. This led in turn to the formation of the International Committee for Virus Nomenclature (later the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses), of which Wildy was the first chairman. This unified virus classification and led to the publication, updated every three years, of the <span class="italic">Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses</span>.<br>
<br>In 1963, after five years in Glasgow, during which the unit he and Stoker had created became an internationally recognized centre of virology, Wildy became professor of virology and bacteriology at the University of Birmingham, where he put together an excellent herpes virology team. Clearly the housekeeping chores of a university department occupied a lot of his time, but he still had the vision to introduce an MSc course in virology which was copied by several other universities. At this time too he started with Colin Kaplan a new journal, <span class="italic">The Journal of General Virology</span>, which from its humble beginnings in 1967 became a well-established and well-regarded addition to the virology scene. As though that was not enough, together with Joseph Melnick of the USA he initiated the International Congresses of Virology. As with the <span class="italic">Journal of General Virology</span>, from the first meeting in Helsinki in 1968 these congresses became major events in the international virology calendar. Wildy also founded, with Bernie Roizman of the USA, the annual Herpes Virus Workshop.<br>
<br>In 1975 Wildy moved to the chair of pathology at Cambridge, and became a fellow of Gonville and Caius College. He had clear ideas about how the department should move forward and he was making arrangements at the time of his death to secure the study of parasitology within both the university and the Molteno Institute.<br>
<br>Because of his many contributions to microbiology Wildy had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1962; he was also president of the Society for General Microbiology from 1978 to 1981 and became an honorary member in 1986. He served on the board of the Public Health Laboratory Service, as well as being an adviser to the World Health Organization and a member of several governing bodies of research council institutes. His wide knowledge and equable personality led to his chairing many (perhaps too many) committees involved in rationalizing British microbiology. Clearly this diverted him from his own research activities far too much, but his breadth of knowledge and vision shone through in what was to be his last grant application to the Medical Research Council for funds to support his research.<br>
<br>Wildy was a countryman at heart and usually found a house in or near a village in which to spend a very full family life, surrounded by plants and animals. He was a large man physically, but this did not give him an overpowering presence. On the contrary, his manner was friendly and kind and it was this manner, together with his generous spirit, which made him the father figure of British virology during his later years. He was also a man of many parts, able to turn his hand to many activities. Aside from his skill on the flute and piccolo, he became involved in the spinning and dying of wool (he actually made a spinning-wheel), reroofed a barn, rebuilt several of the rooms in his house in Abberley in his Birmingham days, and looked after the church clock next to his home when he lived at Hinxton near Cambridge. On top of all these activities, he had a wonderful sense of humour, which enabled him to defuse many difficult professional situations. He was a mimic with quite professional skills and an excellent after-dinner speaker.<br>
<br>Wildy died from lung cancer in Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, on 10 March 1987 and was buried at Hinxton. He was survived by his wife and children.<br>
