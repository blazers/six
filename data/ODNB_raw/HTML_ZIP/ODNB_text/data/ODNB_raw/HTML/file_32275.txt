</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bannerman, Sir  Henry  Campbell-</span>  (1836&#150;1908), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was born at Kelvinside, Glasgow, on 7 September 1836, the second son and the youngest of the six children of Sir James Campbell (1790&#150;1876) and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bannerman (<i>d</i>. 1873). His extra surname was acquired as a condition of inheriting his maternal uncle's estate in 1871. He did not like his &#145;horrid long name&#146;, preferring &#145;Campbell <i>tout court</i>&#146;, or, &#145;as an alternative, CB&#146;  (Spender, 1.62).<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandeducation"></a>Family background and education</h2>Campbell's forebears had been tenant farmers at Inchanoch, Menteith, since the seventeenth century. In 1803 his paternal grandfather, James McOran Campbell (1752&#150;1831), sold the farm lease and followed his eldest son to Glasgow. There he founded a grocery business, but it failed. However, his second and fourth sons, James and William, succeeded in their various enterprises, founding in 1817 a flourishing warehouse and drapery business. The Campbells rapidly established themselves among Glasgow's leading commercial families. As tenacious and purposeful in politics as he was in business, James Campbell became the leader of Glasgow's Conservatives, was knighted in 1841, and served as lord provost from 1840 to 1843. Twice he stood unsuccessfully for parliament. His elder son, Sir James Alexander Campbell (1825&#150;1908), was Conservative MP for the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh (1880&#150;1906).<br>
<br>The Campbells were kindly but strict parents. Despite their wealth they chose not to live ostentatiously. Their views on religion as on politics were strongly held, but differences of opinion were tolerated and were never allowed to disrupt family harmony. Concerned for their children's education, they valued knowledge of the world as highly as book learning and esteemed particularly travel and the acquisition of foreign languages. The young Campbell attended Glasgow high school from 1847 to 1850, but at the age of fourteen, with his brother and cousin, he journeyed through Europe for almost a year. On returning home he went first to Glasgow University (1851&#150;3), then to Trinity College, Cambridge (1854&#150;8), where he read mathematics and classics. He confined his social life to a small group of friends. Unusually for a future politician, he chose to play no part in the university's union. He neither impressed nor was impressed by Cambridge. His examination results (twenty-second senior optime in the mathematical tripos and a third class in the classical tripos) were disappointingly modest.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandchangingpoliticalallegiance"></a>Marriage and changing political allegiance</h2>After university Campbell straightaway joined the family firm. He showed aptitude but was not particularly enthusiastic, and he acquired a reputation for indolence. He was made a partner in 1860. In that same year he met (Sarah) Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1906), the rather plain, stout daughter of the late Major-General Sir Charles Bruce, and they married in September. The young couple were entirely devoted to each other. Cultivated, though not clever, Charlotte was an instinctively shrewd judge of character. She became closely associated with all her husband's plans, jealously guarding his interests and resenting the least supposed slight to his reputation. Her aspirations for his success compensated for his lack of ambition. Years later he told John Morley that Charlotte's contentment was more important to him than his life.<br>
<br>Campbell entered parliament in 1868 as an earnest, impatient radical, yet not until the late 1850s had he begun to question the Conservative principles in which he had been nurtured. The process had begun at Cambridge, prompted by reading Darwin and Spencer. But the deciding factor was his friendship with the radical and Chartist Daniel Lawson. When Campbell ought to have been engaged in his work, he was instead endlessly discussing and debating politics with his friend. His political metamorphosis was confirmed during a year-long correspondence with his brother-in-law, Henry Bruce, that embraced the gamut of contemporary political problems. At Westminster, the tyro politician soon modified his recently acquired beliefs, rejecting republicanism, while his strong faith in individualism turned him resolutely against <i>dirigisme</i>. Imperialism in any guise never held any appeal. His unswerving allegiance to those ideas that inspired Richard Cobden and W. E. Gladstone was as much instinctual as intellectual. He defined Liberalism, simply and pragmatically, as &#145;the politics of common sense&#146;  (Wilson, 230).<h2>
<a name="MPforStirlingBurghsandearlyministerialappointments"></a>MP for Stirling Burghs and early ministerial appointments</h2>In 1865 dilatoriness cost Campbell the opportunity to contest a Glasgow constituency. Three years later, at a by-election in April 1868, he stood for Stirling Burghs as a radical opposing another Liberal of whig sympathies. Though he successfully rebutted the charge that his radicalism was mere opportunism and that he was really a tory in disguise, he narrowly lost. In November 1868, at the general election, against the same opponent but on a greatly enlarged electoral register, he triumphed. Campbell represented Stirling Burghs without interruption for the rest of his parliamentary career.<br>
<br>Both Campbell-Bannermans valued their creature comforts highly. In London they lived in a series of large, well-appointed houses at convenient, fashionable addresses. The weekends they spent at Gennings, a country property CB had inherited near Maidstone, Kent. In 1884 he bought Belmont Castle, at Meigle, Perthshire, after restoration and extension their much loved Scottish home. For forty years their annual routine scarcely changed. When parliament was in session they lived in London. When London became too oppressive they would spend a few days at Dover, at the Lord Warden Hotel. CB's favoured form of exercise was to sit for hours on the pier reading one of his beloved French novels. They always went to Paris for Easter. In June and July, which became established as the season for speech making in the country, they were in Scotland. Then from August to October they invariably travelled on the continent, with six weeks reserved for the &#145;cure&#146; at Marienbad. Their European peregrination always ended in Paris. The autumn parliamentary session found them once more in London, and the year ended as it had begun, entertaining friends at Belmont.<br>
<br>From the first, CB enthusiastically embraced parliament's time-worn conventions. Theatricality, excitement, verbal dexterity, and repartee never fail to please the House of Commons, and CB was eager to oblige. He proved a rather dull dog, hopeless at extempore exchange, easily flustered if interrupted. His speeches were carefully prepared, succinct, persuasive, but, for the most part, read. Myopia obliged him to hold his notes close to his face. He rarely attracted the attention of his auditors, so consequently was discounted as, at best, a mediocre parliamentary performer. Nevertheless, after only three years, he was promoted from the back benches.<br>
<br>Edward Cardwell needed a financial secretary to secure economies at the War Office, and in November 1871 he chose CB for this key appointment. Courageous, determined, impervious to parliamentary criticism, Cardwell made the ideal ministerial mentor and exercised a powerful influence over his junior colleague's subsequent parliamentary career. A change of government in 1874 sent Cardwell to the Lords, and CB became Liberal spokesman on defence in the Commons. He did not make the most of his opportunity and entirely failed to impress the house. In April 1880, when the Liberals returned to power, he did not gain promotion but returned to the War Office, this time to serve under the less than inspiring Hugh Childers. The department was beset by difficulties: war in the Transvaal and, even more distracting, a struggle with the crown over the appointment of Garnet Wolseley as adjutant-general. CB was delivered from these problems when, in May 1882, he was transferred to the Admiralty. There his officials were surprised, then impressed, by his quiet authority and efficient dispatch of business. The unexpected, unintended &#145;reward&#146; for his political acuity in helping to defuse a naval scare campaign was to be offered, in October 1884, &#145;the most disagreeable post in the public service&#146;  (Rosebery to CB, 26 Oct 1884, BL, Add. MS 41226, fol. 100), the Irish chief secretaryship.<h2>
<a name="Irishchiefsecretaryandhomerule"></a>Irish chief secretary and home rule</h2>Others had been offered the appointment and refused. CB accepted only because Charlotte pressed him to seize the opportunity. At Westminster the Irish nationalist MPs could scarcely contain their eagerness to rend this new secretary, whose previous small reputation suggested an easy victim. To their amazement, they found no weaknesses in his armour. He &#145;laughed at their vituperation and was jaunty under their cyclone of attack&#146;  (O'Connor, 26). While his duties were heavy and exacting, they were made easier by his excellent relationship with the viceroy, Spencer, who considered CB the ideal parliamentary spokesman. Though he was chief secretary for only seven months, until the fall of Gladstone's government in June 1885, this proved long enough for CB's reputation and status to be utterly transformed.<br>
<br>On the problem of Ireland's future, CB's general election address in November 1885 was ambivalent. The flight of the &#145;Hawarden kite&#146; in December revealed that Gladstone favoured an Irish parliament. Until Salisbury's intransigence on the Union was declared CB clung to the possibility of compromise. Only after a period of further doubt and misgiving did he declare his support for Gladstone. He admitted on several occasions that his thinking had been inconsistent. The &#145;indispensable condition&#146; that finally determined his support for home rule was that there should be &#145;an end to agitation&#146;  (CB to Sir H. James, 21 July 1886, BL, Add. MS 41232, fol. 300). But Gladstone's proposals, far from ending agitation, divided the Liberal Party and ensured its defeat in the Commons in June 1886 and its electoral rout in the country in July 1886. Despite this political shambles, CB spoke warmly and eloquently for home rule and expressed unqualified support and admiration for Gladstone. When the Liberals again took office, in 1892, their parliamentary majority was too small to secure home rule. Nevertheless, a bill that CB helped to draft was prepared. Though secretary of state for war, CB chose to ignore the declared concerns of the army and lightly dismissed Ulster's opposition as &#145;Ulsteria&#146;. The bill was slain in the Lords. Public opposition to home rule was overwhelming. Gladstone capitulated, and Ireland's governance became a dormant issue at Westminster.<h2>
<a name="CabinetministertheWarOffice188618921895"></a>Cabinet minister: the War Office, 1886, 1892&#150;1895</h2>Campbell-Bannerman was forty-nine when, in February 1886, he entered the cabinet in Gladstone's third government as secretary of state for war. Gladstone would have preferred Childers but deferred to the queen, who insisted she wanted CB. The ministry was no sinecure, and even his first brief tenancy made CB aware of how much the queen interfered, listening to her soldiers rather than to her ministers. Once more in opposition CB proved effective and vigorous. In 1888 he joined somewhat reluctantly Hartington's commission of inquiry into the army's civil and professional administration. He opposed the proposed appointment of a chief of staff because his time at the War Office had impressed him with how senior officers constantly sought to interfere with the minister's decisions. He demonstrated the typical Liberal distrust of militarism and, as a devoted Cardwellian, argued there was no need of any further immediate military reform.<br>
<br>In August 1892 Campbell-Bannerman returned to the War Office, with a seat in the cabinet, in Gladstone's fourth administration, and he retained that office when Rosebery succeeded Gladstone as prime minister in 1894. As minister for war he proposed a series of changes embodying those among the recommendations of the Hartington commission that he approved. He was well aware that, for any reform to succeed, the queen's elderly cousin would have to resign as commander-in-chief. The problem was that George Cambridge was resolutely opposed to resigning. There could be no better testimony to CB's determination, patience, resource, and tact than that, in a mere six weeks, he persuaded the duke to resign, in June 1895. At this moment of triumph the opposition censured CB for compromising the nation's safety by providing insufficient small-arms ammunition and cordite. The charge was false, but CB's rebuttal was unconvincing, and the government was narrowly defeated on St John Brodrick's motion in the House of Commons on 21 June 1895. Had the government been so minded the vote could easily have been reversed. Instead they chose to depart, Rosebery loudly insisting that a cabinet without CB as his colleague was unthinkable. The award of a GCB acknowledged not only Rosebery's genuine appreciation of his worth, but also the queen's gratitude at CB's sensitive handling of her uncle's &#145;resignation&#146;.<br>
<br>In opposition the Unionists had excoriated CB's military reforms as entirely inadequate. In government they were obliged to admit that their own proposals were very little different. CB had been a popular minister with soldiers and civilian advisers alike. Of the ministers with whom he had dealings, Wolseley thought CB much the most capable. CB insisted that his responsibilities were not to be shared or limited, though this never prompted any greater activity on his part or willingness to master the fine details of any brief. What he did demonstrate was the happy, priceless ability to eviscerate verbiage to expose the heart of any matter. Now when he spoke to parliament on defence it was as one thoroughly familiar with military matters. He robustly defended Cardwell's system in the army estimate debates of 1898, and in October 1899, expressing satisfaction with the army's mobilization, he boasted that Cardwell's reforms had entirely fulfilled their purpose and confounded the critics&#151;a reflection that proved somewhat premature. He made nonsense of the military reforms proposed by Unionist secretaries of state, and his frequent assertion that conscription was &#145;impossible&#146; pleased almost all kinds and conditions of Liberals.<h2>
<a name="LiberalleadershipintheCommons"></a>Liberal leadership in the Commons</h2>In February 1894 <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> nominated CB as &#145;the dark horse in any future liberal leadership stakes&#146; and as the &#145;only person capable of stilling the fierce conflicts&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 17 Feb 1894). Few would have agreed and many would have shared Esher's estimate that, &#145;compared with his colleagues&#146;, CB was &#145;very undistinguished&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journals and Letters</span>, 1.181). Far from coveting the party leadership, CB sought the speakership, as it offered an honourable escape from the wrangles of party politics and would allow more time for him to be with Charlotte, whose deteriorating health was a cause of much concern. His initiative startled and discomfited some colleagues, while others supposed he was not being serious. When he pressed his claim, Rosebery told him bluntly that his services could not be spared. CB fumed that his modest, legitimate request should be frustrated. A second appeal to Rosebery proved equally unavailing. Reluctantly CB acknowledged that, apparently, his unavoidable fate was to be a permanent party protagonist.<br>
<br>Following Gladstone's retirement the Liberals were in a hapless state, the parliamentary party riven by jealousy and discontent. Rosebery had every reason to appreciate CB's quiet loyalty. Possessing neither the character nor the will to face down the formidable obstacles confronting his leadership, Rosebery resigned in October 1896. Sir William Harcourt succeeded as Liberal leader in the Commons, but from the beginning his credibility was undermined by the general belief that, when it suited Rosebery, he would resume the leadership. By December 1898 Harcourt had endured enough. Unintentionally, John Morley forfeited his chance to succeed by too close association with Harcourt's resignation. Rosebery declined the reversion, so the choice was confined to the four remaining former cabinet ministers: Bryce, Fowler, Asquith, and CB. Somewhat surprisingly CB emerged as favourite. He was dismissed disparagingly by <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;a temporary leader who will serve adequately enough as a warming pan until a more commanding figure emerges&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Jan 1899). In February 1899, at the Reform Club, CB was unanimously confirmed as Liberal leader in the Commons. Not alone among commentators, J. A. Spender noted CB's anomalous position as the leader of a party &#145;whose men of greatest reputation&#146; stood outside presenting a &#145;disturbing, inscrutable threat&#146;  (<span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, 6 Feb 1899).<h2>
<a name="TheSouthAfricanWar"></a>The South African War</h2>There were those Liberals who would have been happy had CB denounced the Liberal Imperialists as heretics, but in his public statements he strove not to offend Roseberyite sensibilities. These efforts to emphasize Liberal unity came to nothing when war in South Africa exacerbated and emphasized differences. CB never doubted that it was &#145;Joe's war&#146;, and that it had been Joseph Chamberlain's &#145;policy of bluff&#146; that had fomented the conflict  (CB to David Bannerman, 25 Oct 1899, BL, Add. MS 41246, fol. 73). But, as the leader of a national party in wartime, he believed it was not proper to express such views publicly. Nor did he wish to widen the breach with the Liberal Imperialists, despite their showing an almost indecent enthusiasm for the Unionist government's conduct. To pro-Boer Liberals, the issue was perfectly simple. There could be no future for Liberalism if it chose to acquiesce in what was &#145;morally detestable&#146;  (Channing to CB, 19 Nov 1899, Koss, <span class="italic">Pro-Boers</span>, xxvi).<br>
<br>To rumours of an imminent general election, CB had affected indifference. Military successes in the summer of 1900 tempted the government to seek a mandate from the country. CB, who was at Marienbad, did not return to England until five days after parliament's dissolution. For the Liberal Party, prospects could not have been blacker. Their organization was in hopeless disarray, they were short of money, and there was a jingo spirit abroad in the towns that it was assumed would favour the government. CB determined it would be best to husband their few resources. His unquenchable enthusiasm and optimism boosted morale, stilled panic, and rallied Liberals to fight in a common cause. The result of the election was not determined, as so many supposed, by jingo passions but by voter apathy. The Unionist majority scarcely increased, and CB's electoral strategy was completely vindicated. Wisely he discounted the unanimous approval of his leadership, warning friends that extremists in the party&#151;he identified the Roseberyites as the most insidious and deadly&#151;would magnify small differences into mighty schisms.<br>
<br>The government had assumed that the war was all but won when the Boers successfully adopted guerrilla tactics. The British army responded by burning Boer farms and interning Boer families. On 14 June 1901, at a dinner in London given by the National Reform Union, CB passionately condemned these tactics as &#145;methods of barbarism&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 July 1901). The extempore comment excited praise and derision in equal measure. It was no less than his heartfelt response to the bombastic policy that he considered unworthy and stupid. He blamed his political opponents, but they accused him of slandering British troops when for the past eighteen months he had consistently extolled the army's humanity, discipline, and generosity. No fewer than fifty Liberal Imperialist MPs demonstrated their disgust and dissatisfaction with CB's leadership by walking out of the Commons and refusing to support a radical motion condemning the concentration camps. The short-lived &#145;war to the knife and fork&#146;  (Lucy, 85) that followed provided the ludicrous spectacle of pro-Boer and imperialist Liberals attempting to dine and counter-dine each other out of existence. Just as suddenly they determined to kiss and make up, declaring unanimous belief in CB's leadership.<br>
<br>Rosebery still retained his powerful hold over the public imagination. &#145;I would like to bite him harder&#146;, CB confided to Ripon, &#145;but it would not do to outrun the general feeling&#146;  (CB to Ripon, 28 Nov 1901; Strong, 143). At Chesterfield, on 16 December 1901, Rosebery, seeking to recast Liberalism in his own image, implored Liberals to abandon obsolete policies and adopt a &#145;clean slate&#146;. At last it seemed that Rosebery was to give up his self-imposed exile. But the psychological moment to strike came and went. CB delayed his response until 19 February 1902. Then, at Leicester, he thrilled his audience with a powerful avowal that, as a convinced, impenitent Liberal, <i>he</i> would never abandon a single tenet of his faith. When Rosebery was made president of the Liberal League, the breach between the two men was institutionalized. CB was contemptuously tolerant of a body whose <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> was to promote Rosebery. It failed hopelessly, and the earl was reduced to complaints in the press that he had effectively been excommunicated by CB. Reserved animosity between the two was briefly breached when, during the tariff reform controversy, Rosebery so far forgot himself as to call for Liberal unity. As on numerous previous occasions, CB extended a sceptical welcome to no avail.<br>
<br>Self-inflicted Liberal wounds were soothed by peace in South Africa, a process enhanced by a royal commission report that condemned the government's unpreparedness in 1899. Salisbury's resignation, and the succession as Unionist leader and prime minister by his nephew Arthur Balfour, signalled a significant turn of the tide of British opinion. Attention switched from foreign to domestic issues, from stale Liberal dissension to Unionist disagreements. Balfour's <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902 did more than rouse nonconformist anger; miraculously it united Liberals in opposition. CB censured Balfour's measure as much because it denied democratic as religious rights. He was determined to retain nonconformist support and not repeat Gladstone's mistake of 1874. The immediate political advantage for the Liberals was a spate of spectacular and unexpected by-election victories. When Chamberlain, in May 1903, launched his tariff reform campaign, CB immediately condemned it root and branch, yet advised patience, not confrontation, as the better tactic, for it would allow time for Unionist differences to fester. It was his equally shrewd decision to concentrate the campaign for free trade in the country rather than at Westminster. The hapless Unionists damaged themselves further by approving Milner's scheme to employ indentured Chinese labourers in the Transvaal goldmines, an issue that excited a host of powerful prejudices in the minds of the electorate.<br>
<br>By the end of the parliamentary session in 1904, indifferent health, domestic anxiety, and political strain had reduced CB to utter exhaustion. Yet he returned from his customary long continental holiday apparently as vigorous and determined as ever. He told the Irish nationalists that immediate home rule was impractical and offered instead a gradualist policy of amelioration. To this, John Redmond, leader of the Irish party, somewhat surprisingly agreed, promising in addition that he would use his best efforts to secure the Irish vote for the Liberals, considered vital for electoral success. This was an extraordinary tribute to the trust and affection in which CB was held by the nationalists. With the concurrence of Asquith and Grey, CB publicly announced at Stirling, on 23 November 1905, his step-by-step policy, while reaffirming Liberal support for eventual Irish self-rule. This last provoked Rosebery to sever any remaining connection with CB. It was a disastrous miscalculation that left Rosebery politically isolated and powerless. At last CB was freed of his greatest political incubus. With courage, determination, principled politics, and shrewd tactics, the temporary incumbent of six years earlier had strengthened his hold on the Liberal leadership. Unionist hubris, incompetence, and division had eased CB's task, while death, disease, and finally political miscalculation had successively removed his rivals. But fortune rewarded his resolution only after many sore trials. He had never sacrificed his innate modesty, and with rare selflessness had invariably put his party before his own success. Only a truly gifted leader could have forged out of powerless, disaffected fragments a viable anti-Unionist coalition that embraced a motley collection of whigs, Gladstonian Liberals, radicals, progressives, Lib&#150;Lab trade unionists, and ex-Unionist free-traders. Ever the political realist, CB did not allow euphoria to betray his hard-won success. Liberal homogeneity, he acknowledged, was more apparent than real. The party he led remained, at best, a fragile coalition.<h2>
<a name="AppointedpremierDecember1905"></a>Appointed premier, December 1905</h2>Supposing that Rosebery's outburst signalled renewed Liberal strife, Balfour resigned as prime minister on 4 December 1905 without seeking a dissolution. Minority government had been a dilemma that many Liberals had anticipated with dread. It was not a prospect that held any fears for CB. On 5 December 1905 he happily accepted the king's commission and selected a cabinet that reflected every aspect of the Liberal coalition, rewarding old friends, acknowledging talent, indulging sentiment, and encouraging promise. Three of Rosebery's senior lieutenants, fearing the prospect of a &#145;little England&#146; administration led by a man they supposed a weak, tired mediocrity, had earlier agreed among themselves to refuse office unless CB went to the Lords. This outrageous proposal would have made him prime minister in name only. CB successfully called their bluff. Despite their perfidy, he offered them three key cabinet posts: the exchequer, and the Foreign and War offices. Asquith's presence in a Liberal cabinet had always been indispensable, whereas Grey and Haldane were given high office partly to reassure the Roseberyites but mainly to enhance the chances of a Liberal victory at the impending general election, for the new government immediately dissolved parliament.<br>
<br>The speech with which CB launched the electoral campaign at the Albert Hall, on 21 December 1905, received the kind of rapturous acclaim that previously Gladstone alone had commanded. Unionist failings were highlighted. Although old-age pensions were not mentioned, the speech skilfully suggested long-held Liberal aspirations were about to be rewarded. CB firmly nailed free-trade colours to the Liberal mast, the better to promote party unity and induce Unionist discord. Balfour supposed that CB was the helpless hostage of wild revolutionaries, whereas the bulk of the party, CB very well knew, were of a decidedly cautious and centrist disposition. Consequently his speech was descriptive, not prescriptive, and instead of a programme he offered an electoral slogan redolent of the past: &#145;peace, retrenchment, and reform&#146;. In the polling, which took place during January 1906, the Liberals swept to a landslide victory. CB's considerable contribution was rightly acknowledged, but the result largely reflected the electorate's dissatisfaction with the Unionists. When he met the new Commons, his assured and effective performances from the dispatch box&#151;most notably his verbal lashing of Balfour's dialectical meanderings as &#145;foolery&#146;&#151;roused Liberals to a frenzy of enthusiasm. Deservedly he basked in their respect and affection, &#145;the great, outstanding personality of the new Ministry, dwarfing and submerging all the others&#146;  (O'Connor, 87). It was a fitting culmination to a remarkable parliamentary journey: from respectable obscurity to leadership; from obloquy to popularity, praise, and affectionate admiration.<h2>
<a name="HouseofLordsSouthAfricaandwomenssuffrage"></a>House of Lords, South Africa, and women's suffrage</h2>To satisfy the nonconformists, the legislative priority consisted of two bills, on education and temperance. Also, to retain support from the Irish nationalists, legislation short of home rule was required. All these plans were thwarted by the opposition of the House of Lords. Liberal administrations customarily suffered at the hands of the upper house. CB on numerous previous occasions had condemned the absurdity of parliament's second chamber behaving as though it were an annexe of the Unionist Party. In 1894 he had advised the queen that one day the Lords' behaviour would inevitably lead to deadlock and constitutional chaos. Now the Lords, at Balfour's direct behest, were mutilating and destroying Liberal measures. CB angrily insisted that democracy would triumph and the will of the people prevail, yet counselled patience rather than confrontation. It is uncertain whether he desired that the Lords be given the opportunity to mend themselves, or thoroughly to alienate the electorate by their intemperate behaviour. Technically his tactics were wise, but his nonconformist supporters in particular grew frustrated and resentful. They supposed that their prime minister lacked the political will for a fight. Meanwhile, CB wisely rejected a proposal from a cabinet committee to reform the composition of the Lords. He recognized the priority was to resolve relations between the two houses. He persuaded cabinet colleagues to accept the suspensory veto, and introduced the measure on 24 June 1907 with arguably the most impressive speech he ever made to the Commons&#151;all the more remarkable for its being made the day after he suffered a heart attack. The problem of the Lords was not solved in CB's lifetime, but he effectively determined his successor's path towards the 1911 <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span>.<br>
<br>During the South African War CB had declared publicly that the former Boer republics should be returned to self-government, and he never wavered from that belief. The Colonial Office did not share his opinion, but he rejected their advice, together with that of a cabinet committee. Virtually single-handed he persuaded his colleagues to return self-government to the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony. In August 1906 he was able to circumvent the Lords' veto by an order in council, thus giving South Africa what he could not give Ireland. His magnanimous act of statesmanship hastened the South African <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> of 1910 and secured friendship and trust from a generation of South African political leaders.<br>
<br>On constitutional issues CB's record was not entirely beyond reproach. He was a sympathetic but not enthusiastic supporter of votes for women. As party leader he not unreasonably refused to pledge Liberals on an issue peripheral to the main political debates and upon which they were divided. On 19 May 1906 he told a deputation led by Emily Davies that he considered their case conclusive and irrefutable, but he nevertheless counselled them to be patient and to continue lobbying&#151;advice that encouraged the constitutionalists but enraged the militants. In 1906 and again in 1907 private members' bills for women's franchise were talked out of the house. CB's attitude has been well described as &#145;friendly but timid&#146;  (Rover, 122). His unspoken concern was that, if women were enfranchised, it might serve Unionist more than Liberal interests.<h2>
<a name="ProgressivismandLabour"></a>Progressivism and Labour</h2>In the public mind the radical prime minister was associated with the new Liberalism of C. F. G. Masterman and the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>. Many had hoped, though some dreaded, that the Liberals would introduce a vigorous programme of economic and social reforms. As opposition leader CB had frequently been urged to sponsor a disparate range of progressive measures. His election address had included the promise to modernize the poor law, alleviate unemployment, and improve conditions in the sweated industries. He was deeply and genuinely concerned about the plight of the poor and so had readily adopted the rhetoric of progressivism, but he was not a progressive. This was not, as Haldane suggested, because he was &#145;a dear old Tory &hellip; determined to do little&#146;  (Wilson, 500). CB was old and set in his ways, and he remained what he had for so long been: a Gladstonian Liberal. In office, like Gladstone, he proved a better constitutional than social reformer. His attachment to orthodox Gladstonian economics prompted his desire to reduce public expenditure. This appeared to be at odds with the financial implications of any ambitious reform scheme. What mattered most to CB, however, was the knowledge that social reform divided Liberals, whereas party unity was his major concern.<br>
<br>Was the progressive anti-Unionist alliance that CB had helped to forge no more than a convenient electoral device? Labour and Liberal politicians traditionally adopted different views on how to improve working-class conditions. Judgements differed whether it was possible, even desirable, to create a single, progressive party sheltering Labour and Liberal views and uniting the radical vote. A party that sounded and acted so differently when street-corner evangelizing as socialist and debating at Westminster as Labour necessarily prompted ambivalence in the most sympathetic Liberal mind. CB never took Labour's taunts and propaganda seriously. He did not believe that socialism was about to replace Liberalism. He had been closely associated with the 1903 electoral pact between the Liberal chief whip, Herbert Gladstone, and Ramsay MacDonald on behalf of the Labour Representation Committee, which, while it ensured that Labour candidates would be unopposed by Liberals, had been designed to serve Liberal as much as Labour interests. He did not suppose that he had gullibly &#145;afforded room to the Socialist cuckoo in the Liberal nest&#146;  (Douglas, xii). Nor was he unduly concerned about Labour intervention in by-elections. For personal as much as political reasons he had appointed John Burns a minister.<br>
<br>That CB's sympathy for many Labour aspirations was genuine is well illustrated by his conduct over the <span class="roman">Trade Disputes Bill</span> (1906). Against his instincts, he had deferred to a majority cabinet decision that legislation to reverse the Taff Vale judgement should restore limited rights only to trade unions. To the consternation and amazement of colleagues, on the floor of the Commons he spoke, then voted, for a Labour-sponsored bill. Despite the formidable opposition of Liberal lawyers and senior colleagues, he succeeded in embodying the total immunity of the Labour bill into the government's legislation. Labour and Liberal differences concerning the treatment of trade unions were of long standing. CB had always tended to favour Labour's views, and fifteen years earlier he had been censured by Elgin for supporting striking railway workers. Although CB personally liked and got on well with most Labour leaders, his sympathy for their proposals never implied commitment. Arthur Ponsonby, CB's secretary and himself a Labour sympathizer, noted that the prime minister was always anxious that his administration should never be thought to be &#145;in the hands and at the mercy of Labour&#146;  (Ponsonby to Bryce, 24 May 1907; Harris and Hazlehurst, 377).<br>
<br>Despite trials and tribulations, CB's administration secured a number of important social reforms. What it achieved was consistent with traditional Liberal values, and because it did not challenge Unionist interests it was not destroyed in the Lords. There was legislation concerning factories, workshops, and mines and workmen's compensation. Perhaps most significantly, the groundwork was laid for major reforms later achieved under Asquith's leadership. The budget of 1907 trailed provision for the funding necessary for old-age pensions. Given CB's views on economics, it was no accident that part of the financial strategy to secure funding for pensions was to effect economy in the spending upon the armed forces.<h2>
<a name="Defencepolicy"></a>Defence policy</h2>Most Liberals thought the army a waste of time and money. Radicals&#151;the loudest, most scathing anti-militarists&#151;neither liked nor trusted Haldane, the secretary of state for war, but supposed he would &#145;be compelled to abjure his heresies and support the democratic policies of his chief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Concord</span>, January 1906, 4). CB knew that Haldane was an incorrigible conspirator, but acknowledged he was also an able administrator, capable, as few others were, of undertaking required army reforms. Haldane assiduously cultivated the support of the prime minister, whom he had not supported when in opposition. It was given unstintingly. Both prime minister and secretary of state recognized that &#145;the inevitable result of failure&#146; would be &#145;an agitation for compulsion&#146;&#151;that is, compulsory military service  (Haldane to J. A. Spender, 26 Feb 1907; Koss, <span class="italic">Haldane</span>, 51). Haldane's restoration of the essential features of Edward Cardwell's system of army organization mollified CB. But he also saw, despite the opacity of Haldane's rhetoric, the minister's conceptual clarity, placing economy and voluntarism&#151;both sound Liberal principles&#151;at the heart of his proposals.<br>
<br>Disowning responsibility for increased costs in his department, Haldane happily and frequently emphasized that foreign and defence policies are complementary. Diplomatic apprehensions about Germany's hostile intent were immediately reflected in increased estimates for the Admiralty. The problem was exacerbated when the launch of the first Dreadnought battleship in 1906 transformed naval strategy, technology, and economy. Privately CB thought continued observance of the two-power naval building standard irrational. He proposed a cut in the capital shipbuilding programme with the caveat that, if the peace conference at The Hague in 1907 failed, the cut would be reversed. On the eve of the conference CB published in <span class="italic">The Nation</span> (March 1907) some anodyne proposals for armament cuts. They reflected his generous, trusting nature, but the Germans perversely saw it as a plot to secure permanent British naval supremacy. So CB's single foray into public diplomacy proved an abject failure. Naval &#145;economists&#146; who had been elated by CB's proposals were now instead obliged to deplore a small rise in the 1908 naval estimates. CB was well aware that selfish departmental imperatives were driving ever upwards the estimates of the armed services. He was uneasy at the constant lobbying and squabbling for increased funding. Had the committee of imperial defence (CID) fulfilled its intended role, that would have helped resolve the difficulties. He changed his earlier opinion that the CID was a mischievous assembly, but he never fully exploited its potential.<h2>
<a name="Foreignpolicy"></a>Foreign policy</h2>Radicals, who were averse to the notion of continuity, wanted a progressive foreign policy distinct from that pursued by the Unionists. They dubbed CB's election address the &#145;league of peace&#146; speech, emphasizing his opposition to aggression and support for disarmament; they thereby chose to ignore his equally clear statement that foreign policy would continue upon existing lines. In December 1905 a demoralized France, bullied in Morocco by Germany, wished to discover exactly what Britain would do if war broke out with Germany. Grey approved military and naval conversations between the military and naval staff of both countries. CB agreed though he had misgivings, as he recognized joint preparations for a war came uncomfortably close to an honourable undertaking. He did not inform certain senior cabinet colleagues about these arrangements because he expected their opposition. Knowledge of the conversations became general only after CB's death. Radicals argued either that he had not known of the talks or that he had been deliberately misled by Grey as to their significance. Grey, they maintained, was the willing accomplice&#151;some even suggested cipher&#151;of his anti-German permanent officials at the Foreign Office, or else he had been duped by French chauvinists. CB had supported Grey but, making no allowance for diplomatic or military initiative, had na&iuml;vely assumed, or hoped, that no further commitment was implied. This was the limited view he advertised to Clemenceau in April 1907. The French premier was shocked and angered by what Cambon, with unfailing diplomatic finesse, described as &#145;un petit malentendu&#146;  (Wilson, 544). When the two premiers next met, in January 1908, there was no repeat of the misunderstanding.<br>
<br>Many Liberals condemned negotiations with Russia, begun in July 1906, as politically unacceptable&#151;a moral affront and a diplomatic disaster. CB considered these criticisms ill-informed. The tsar's ill-advised dissolution of the Russian parliament appeared to ruin any chance of a diplomatic agreement. CB, who that day was due to address the Interparliamentary Union, immediately added a postscript to his speech, &#145;La Douma est morte&#151;Vive la Douma&#146;  (23 July 1907; Spender, pl. facing 2.264). His audience, which included Russian delegates, greeted his peroration with wild enthusiasm. It was a further example of CB's extraordinary ability exactly to capture a public mood or sentiment in a few simple, sincere words. At the end of August 1907 the Anglo-Russian agreement was signed, and CB was the first to congratulate Grey for &#145;a great achievement that &hellip; [would] make things easier in Europe&#146;  (CB to Grey, 3 Sept 1907; Trevelyan, 189). Those who condemned the agreement as designed to isolate Germany diplomatically later perversely argued that CB had opposed Grey's Russian policy.<h2>
<a name="Conductofthecabinetandprimeministerialroutine"></a>Conduct of the cabinet and prime ministerial routine</h2>It was CB's policy never to interfere more than absolutely necessary in the affairs of any department of state, and this undoubtedly exaggerated the Foreign Office's already notorious independence. Never pretending to the part of a dynamic, innovative leader such as Gladstone, CB managed, facilitated, and mediated the work of his colleagues. He never sought to steal the limelight, for he lusted neither for prizes nor for personal glory. If the occasion required he never hesitated to demonstrate his authority, for he knew his own mind and was determined, but invariably tactful. Given the fragile unity of the Liberals, there was much to recommend his cautious, quietist approach. His emollient wisdom kept the cabinet &#145;peculiarly and happily free from personal differences and restlessness&#146;  (Grey, 1.67). Nevertheless, there were reservations about his style of managing the cabinet. Haldane likened it to &#145;a meeting of delegates&#146;. He criticized CB for &#145;insufficient consultation &hellip; relying unduly upon the initiative of individual ministers&#146;. Yet Haldane acknowledged that, once the prime minister's confidence was secured, &#145;there were few better chiefs to work for&#146;  (Haldane, 182, 217&#150;18). Everyone who worked with CB had reason to appreciate his spontaneity, generosity, and kind-heartedness. What was not always realized was that although he readily forgave he did not so easily forget. His private secretary noted that CB was &#145;outwardly easy-going &hellip; inwardly &hellip; firm and resolute&#146;  (Hirst, 262). The suggestion by some critics that CB's <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude reflected indolence is incorrect: he was never lethargic or indifferent.<br>
<br>Trivial routine and lesser activities occupied CB's days as much as grave matters of state. As a Presbyterian, he professed not to know what a rural dean was, yet for someone who was a lifelong advocate of disestablishment he took inordinate pains over church preferments. &#145;You said I never acted on your advice&#146;, he wrote to his friend Archbishop Randall Davidson, &#145;But you will be lenient to my doubts and perplexities!&#146;  (CB to Davidson, 5 Nov 1907; Bell, 1239). Averse to high-churchmen, he sought to promote evangelicals, his intention bolstered by the opposition of a predominantly Anglo-Catholic bench of bishops in the Lords to the government's education bills. But, as he enquired with mock bemusement of Spence Watson, the Quaker president of the National Liberal Federation, &#145;What is a poor devil to do when all the new school of Church Liberals are Sacerdotalists and the Evangelicals of note, pronounced Tories?&#146;  (CB to Spence Watson, 13 July 1907; BL, Add. MS 41242, fol. 254).<br>
<br>CB was noted for his pawky sense of humour, and few subjects were as unfailing a source of amusement to him as the effrontery, exaggerated expectation, and obvious unsuitability of many who sought inclusion in the honours list. The party had been long out of power, and now the importunate faithful expected their reward. On occasion CB was overgenerous, but he was genuinely alarmed to discover the large sums routinely extracted from ambitious petitioners by the Liberal chief whip. Despite his disapproval, the time-dishonoured traffic continued unabated. He refused an earldom for Curzon on the grounds that it was absurd to recommend what the viceroy's own political friends had denied. This argument did not impress the king, who supported Curzon's claim.<br>
<br>Edward VII enjoyed his prime minister's company when taking the cure at Marienbad, but generally their relationship was fraught with niggling difficulties rooted in the king's antipathy to CB's political beliefs. The king disapproved of his behaviour during the South African War, particularly the &#145;methods of barbarism&#146; speech, he deprecated CB writing about disarmament in a radical journal, he was horrified as much as amazed that he agreed with female enfranchisement, he was angered by CB's failure to curb the more extravagant language of young colleagues, and he blamed him for exacerbating the clashes between the Commons and the Lords. Edward was much exasperated, and not entirely without reason, by the meagreness of CB's cabinet letters. CB informed Knollys that he was sorry to have earned the king's displeasure but, characteristically, proffered no apology. He found that cabinet meetings were generally tedious and saw no reason why he should pretend otherwise merely to amuse the king. It was typical of their relationship that Edward discouraged CB, despite the prime minister's mortal illness, from returning too soon, so that he would not be incommoded by having to cut short his holiday at Biarritz.<h2>
<a name="Bereavementanddeath"></a>Bereavement and death</h2>During CB's comparatively short time as prime minister his energy was eroded by illness, age, and grief. Much the most severe blow he suffered was the death of his beloved wife, on 30 August 1906, from which he never fully recovered, emotionally or physically. Charlotte's illness had grown increasingly painful and debilitating. Through every crisis CB nursed her with tender care and anxious devotion. He readily acknowledged to Knollys that the time and energy he gave unstintingly to his wife meant that he neglected his prime-ministerial duties. He knew this was not right, but he could do no other. Never were a couple more devoted than Henry and Charlotte: &#145;their hearts were as one&#146; (from the lines of Tasso chosen by CB to be inscribed on his wife's memorial tablet in Meigle church).<br>
<br>Shortly after Charlotte's death, CB suffered the first of a series of progressively more serious and damaging heart attacks. Each time he appeared to have made a rapid and full recovery. He returned to Westminster, made speeches in the country, carried out his official duties, and even visited Paris and Biarritz. But these jaunts did not have the savour of earlier visits to the continent, and CB grew increasingly fatigued. His illness was kept from the public until a fourth attack, which was particularly sharp and debilitating, in late November 1907. Asquith, as crown prince, increasingly handled the reins of power, but CB did not formally resign office until 4 April 1908. He died on the morning of 22 April 1908 while still in residence at 10 Downing Street. Generous tributes were paid CB in parliament, and an impressive service was held at Westminster Abbey. Arthur Ponsonby was not so much impressed by the establishment's conventional obsequies at the death of a prime minister as he was by the intense reverence and sympathy etched on the faces of the silent masses in the streets mourning the passing of a much loved old man. As CB's coffin sped north for interment on 28 April next to Charlotte's in Meigle churchyard, groups of railwaymen stood bare-headed at the railway side, paying silent tribute to a good man.<h2>
<a name="CBinhistory"></a>CB in history</h2>In the debates between historians about Labour's rise to power and what George Dangerfield characterized as Liberal England's strange death, where the focus has been personality it has concentrated almost exclusively upon CB's successors as prime minister, Asquith and Lloyd George. The leader who, more than any other, made possible the Liberal decade of dominance has been relatively ignored. Yet CB has been fortunate in his two major biographers, J. A. Spender and John Wilson. Though not an intimate, Spender knew CB well and was thoroughly familiar with the contemporary political scene. CB's official life, published in 1923, is detailed, unvarnished, and straightforward. Radical and Labour critics complained that it insufficiently emphasized CB's supposedly distinctive views on peace, disarmament, and the conduct of foreign affairs. Ponsonby supposed Spender had fallen into error not only because of his Liberal Imperialist sympathies but also because he effectively ignored the memoir of CB that he (Ponsonby) had written. Despite their considerable value, especially on domestic issues during CB's premiership, Ponsonby's notes are not particularly reliable on military and diplomatic issues, as his memory was coloured by the events of the First World War. F. W. Hirst used the notes in writing an idealized portrait of CB that concludes with the assurance: &#145;he kept the faith to the end and was no way responsible for the European tragedy that came to pass six years after his death&#146;  (Hirst, 265). Wilson's biography, published in 1973, is worldly-wise in its judgements; scholarly and subtly nuanced, it does justice to CB as a man and a politician. It confirms the broad outlines of Spender's earlier work. Some reservation has been expressed that his account is stronger on character than interpretation. The torrents of monographs and articles analysing so many aspects of Victorian and Edwardian political life, as well as the further release of private papers, have, it is true, added considerable detail. Yet they do not suggest any need for major revision of the viewpoint taken in Wilson's balanced, persuasive portrait of Britain's first and only radical prime minister.<br>
