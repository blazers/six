<span class="headword">Crace,  John Gregory</span>  (1809&#150;1889), <span class="occ">interior decorator and author</span>, was born on 26 May 1809 at 34 Curzon Street, London, the elder of two surviving sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6556/', "Frederick Crace (1779&#150;1859)")</script>, interior decorator and collector, and his wife, Augusta Harrop Gregory (1783/4&#150;1827), the daughter of John Gregory of Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, magistrate and treasurer of the Whig Club, and his wife, Mary. His father was renowned as decorator to the prince regent, and was head of a decorating firm founded in 1768 by Frederick's grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60734/', "Edward Crace")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67885/', "Crace family")</script>], a coach decorator and keeper of the king's pictures.<br>
<br>Crace was apparently sickly as a young boy but grew very tall (6 feet 1 inch) and was of generally robust health as an adult. He was educated first at Dr Crombie's school in Greenwich, and later at Mr Pollard's school in South Kensington. Although he was never formally apprenticed, he was admitted to the freedom of the Painter&#150;Stainers' Company in 1855 and, after a long and distinguished career, became master in 1879&#150;80. He made his first trip abroad to Paris in 1825 in the company of his father, and returned there frequently during his life. In 1829 he made an extended study tour of France and Germany in the company of a family friend, Mr Buchan, returning to Paris and Rouen the following year to assist with a lawsuit brought against his uncle, Alfred Crace. He was in Paris during the revolution of July 1830, witnessed fighting on the streets, and he himself narrowly missed being shot in the place des Gr&egrave;ves while browsing at a bookstall.<br>
<br>Crace began his career in 1825 by working for his father, who was commissioned to execute decorative work at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace by George IV. He later recalled rising at 5.30 each morning to give the workmen their orders for the day. On attaining the age of twenty-one in 1830 he received property and &pound;3200 in cash from his mother's estate. This inheritance enabled him to become a full partner in his father's business, which was known thereafter as Frederick Crace &amp; Son until the former's death in 1859, when it became J. G. Crace &amp; Son. A memorandum in J. G. Crace's hand, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum archives, suggests that this partnership came at a critical point for the firm, whose business had significantly fallen off owing to Frederick Crace's having devoted himself almost exclusively to commissions for George IV, notorious for his non-payment of debts.<br>
<br>A further sense of urgency was added by Crace's marriage, on 26 January 1833, to Sarah Jane Hine (1815&#150;1894), the daughter of John Inwood Langley (1780&#150;1874), a civil servant at the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich. Crace had become friendly with Mr Langley while undertaking decorative work on behalf of his father, who was painter to the board of works. Shortly afterwards Crace and his wife, to whom he remained happily married all his life, began what was to become a large family of twelve children, eleven of whom survived infancy. Crace was determined to improve his income and build up a larger client base for the firm. To do so, in 1837 he embarked on a study tour of interior decoration in Paris, returning to decorate a new showroom at the Crace premises in 14 Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square (occupied by Crace &amp; Son from 1827 to 1899, and renumbered 38 Wigmore Street in 1859). Invitations were issued to prospective clients and country house owners to view the new decorations in the French Renaissance and other styles at a series of open-house evenings.<br>
<br>The open-house evenings at Wigmore Street proved to be an immediate success, and Crace quickly established himself as the leading London decorator. One of his most important clients was Andrew Spencer Cavendish, the sixth duke of Devonshire, a patron of the arts whom Crace described as the noblest gentleman he ever knew. Throughout the 1840s Crace worked extensively for the duke, most notably at Devonshire House, London, and Chatsworth, Derbyshire, where he created a remarkable private library in the &#145;old French style&#146;, including a suite of library furniture. At Hardwick Hall, another Devonshire property, Crace was involved in the care and conservation of the important collection of early textiles. In conjunction with the great Gothic revival architect, A. W. N. Pugin, with whom he formed a partnership in 1844, from 1849 to 1852 Crace decorated and produced furniture at Lismore Castle, the duke's summer retreat in Ireland.<br>
<br>Crace also came to the attention of the queen and prince consort. In 1841 he designed wall and ceiling decoration in a medievalizing style at Taymouth Castle, Perthshire, for the second marquess of Breadalbane, who engaged him to create a suite of state rooms in which to receive Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Crace's duties included attendance at the evening reception for the queen and Prince Albert, complete with fireworks, bonfires, and dancing highlanders. Prince Albert later asked Crace to decorate a number of interiors at Windsor Castle, including the Waterloo chamber (1860&#150;62).<br>
<br>By 1844 Crace's designs&#151;notably the Gothic state rooms he created at Knebworth, Hertfordshire, for the novelist Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#151;were displaying the imprint of Pugin in certain details. Crace had travelled to Munich in 1843 to study the principal buildings of the new town, built under the supervision of the architect Leo von Klenze. He came away with a theory of using bold polychromatic decoration in architecture that was to support his work in the Gothic style, which continued for about a decade after the death of Pugin (in 1852). His principal commissions in the Gothic style included Chirk Castle, Wales (1846&#150;8), Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire (1849&#150;50), Abney Hall, Cheshire (1852&#150;7), Tyntesfield, Somerset (from 1854), and the new palace of Westminster (1845&#150;69), all begun in partnership with Pugin, with whom he formed a close friendship.<br>
<br>It was, however, at the international exhibitions of 1851 and 1862 in London, of 1855 and 1867 in Paris, and at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, that Crace achieved a wider fame, beyond royal and country house circles, resulting in an increasing number of civic and institutional commissions. In 1851 he was closely involved with Pugin in creating the Medieval Court, and in 1862 he took over the decoration of the entire controversial building at short notice, as well as acting as exhibitor and a principal juror. He was again a juror in 1867 in Paris, where he exhibited and received a medal from the Imperial Commission under Napoleon III.<br>
<br>In 1852 Crace became interested in wet process photography and became a founder member of the Photographic Society (later the Royal Photographic Society). In 1855, to recover from a breakdown in his health, Crace travelled to Moorish Spain and made the first photographs of the Alhambra at Granada, the Alc&aacute;zar at Seville, and other monuments. After the 1862 exhibition, his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51463/', "John Dibblee Crace")</script>, increasingly took over the running of the firm, becoming a partner with his father in 1873. This left the elder Crace free to devote himself to travel and study. As well as lecturing to the Institute of British Architects (later the RIBA) and other learned bodies, which he had done since 1839, he published a number of articles on colour theory, decorative practices, and the first history of wallpaper. He continued a limited amount of professional work during the 1880s.<br>
<br>Crace lived at the Wigmore Street premises from 1833 to 1851, when he moved to 6 Grove End Road, St John's Wood, with a garden laid out by his friend, Sir Joseph Paxton, staying there until 1858. Thereafter he lived in a large Italianate house, called Springfield, in Half Moon Lane, Dulwich, where he died at the age of eighty on 13 August 1889. J. D. Crace observed that with his father he had lost his most valued friend and adviser. The historic Crace decorating firm outlived John Gregory Crace by only ten years: his son wound up the business in 1899 in order to devote himself to decorating and consulting work.<br>
