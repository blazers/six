<span class="headword">Fitzroy,  George Henry</span>, fourth duke of Grafton  (1760&#150;1844), <span class="occ">politician</span>, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9628/', "Augustus Henry Fitzroy, third duke")</script>, and his first wife, Anne, daughter of Henry Liddell, first Baron Ravensworth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/88658/', "Fitzpatrick, Anne, countess of Upper Ossory (1737/&#150;1804)")</script>], was born on 14 January 1760. He was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became an intimate friend of the younger Pitt. On 16 November 1784 he married Lady Charlotte Maria (1761&#150;1808), second daughter of James Waldegrave, second Earl Waldegrave. She died of bilious fever in 1808, having had three sons and four daughters. As Lord Euston he was MP for Thetford from 1782 to 1784, supporting Shelburne's ministry. In 1784, with William Pitt, he was elected as MP for Cambridge University, and held this seat until 1811, when he succeeded to the peerage.<br>
<br>Euston's career in the House of Commons was useful, but not brilliant. At the outset he supported the government of Pitt, but he rarely addressed the house. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Suffolk in 1790, receiver-general in the courts of king's bench and common pleas, and king's gamekeeper at Newmarket. From 1784 to 1807 he was ranger of Hyde Park and of St James's Park. In addition to these offices, conferred upon him by the prime minister, he was hereditary ranger of Whittlebury Forest, recorder of Thetford, a trustee of the Hunterian Museum, and president of the Eclectic Society of London. His seat at Cambridge was twice contested, first in 1790, and second in 1807 by Lord Palmerston, but in both cases unsuccessfully. Despite Pitt's friendship, and the patronage of the tories, Euston was unable to support all the government's measures over the war against France, and broke with Pitt when he became the centre of embarrassments. In fact, long before Pitt's death, Euston had become a whig. From his accession to the dukedom in March 1811 he steadfastly cast his votes and exercised all his influence in favour of civil and religious liberty. He did not, however, show bitterness towards his former friends, being considerate and urbane in speech and action. When the bill of pains and penalties against Queen Caroline was presented to the House of Lords, he spoke vehemently against the measure, and this was almost the last occasion on which he took a prominent part in the business of parliament. He died at his seat, Euston Hall, Suffolk, on 28 September 1844, and was buried there on 15 October. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry.<br>
