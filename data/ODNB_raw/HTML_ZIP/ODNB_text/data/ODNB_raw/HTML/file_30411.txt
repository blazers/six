<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macarthur <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Anderson]</span>,  Mary Reid</span>  (1880&#150;1921), <span class="occ">women's labour organizer</span>, was born at Glasgow on 13 August 1880, the eldest daughter of John Duncan Macarthur, proprietor of a drapery business, and his wife, Anne Elizabeth Martin. She was one of six children, of whom only three survived. Educated at Glasgow Girls' High School, she also studied in Germany before working as a bookkeeper for her father. She initially endorsed her family's Conservative politics and was a member of the Primrose League, but was unexpectedly impressed by a meeting she attended in 1901 to discuss the establishment of a branch of the Shop Assistants' Union in Ayr and became an advocate of trade unionism. Within months she was chairing the new Ayr branch.<br>
<br>Mary Macarthur rapidly graduated to presidency of the Scottish national district council of the union and by 1903 was the first woman on its national executive. She moved to London and became honorary secretary of the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL). She encouraged trade unions with women members to affiliate and dramatically increased membership. Her colleagues and friends included Sir Charles and Lady Emilia Dilke and Margaret Bondfield. She travelled to the International Congress of Women in Berlin in 1904. For a time she was the only woman delegate to the London Trades Council. Mary Macarthur is perhaps best known for founding the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. She began as president, but then exchanged offices with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36572/', "Gertrude Tuckwell (1861&#150;1951)")</script> to become general secretary. By the end of its first year the NFWW boasted seventeen branches in Scotland and England and about two thousand members. Mary Macarthur was especially concerned about the relationship between low wages and women's lack of organization. In 1907 she began (and edited) the monthly paper the <span class="italic">Woman Worker</span>, which was soon transformed into a weekly with a circulation of about 20,000.<br>
<br>A tireless campaigner on behalf of sweated workers, Mary Macarthur sat on the executive of the Anti-Sweating League, gave evidence to the select committee on homework (1908), and advocated a legal minimum wage. She regarded the establishment of trade boards as a legislative revolution, and helped to set up the lace-mending and finishing board in Nottingham and sat on the chain-making board; she then helped to organize the Cradley Heath women chainmakers when they struck to secure implementation of their rightful new rates. In the summer of 1911 she organized an estimated 2000 women involved in twenty concurrent strikes in Bermondsey and elsewhere. The character of Miss Doremus in Kathleen Woodward's story <span class="italic">Jipping Street</span> (1928), set in the Bermondsey area, is allegedly based on Mary Macarthur. As an adult suffragist, and honorary secretary to the People's Suffrage Federation, she saw her primary commitment as providing protection for working-class women rather than concentrating on the voting rights of women.<br>
<br>Mary Macarthur was a member of the national council of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) from 1909 to 1912. On 21 September 1911 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47322/', "William Crawford Anderson (1877&#150;1919)")</script>, a self-educated, working-class journalist, who chaired the executive committee of the ILP. Their first child died at birth in 1913 but two years later a daughter, Anne Elizabeth (Nancy), was born. From 1914 to 1918 William Anderson was MP for Attercliffe, Sheffield. Once she was enfranchised, Mary Macarthur stood for parliament. She was defeated as Labour candidate for Stourbridge, Worcestershire, in 1918; some attributed this to the fact that although she had campaigned as Mary Macarthur the returning officer had insisted on describing her on the polling card as Mrs W. C. Anderson. By 1919 she was on the executive of the Labour Party and the following year became one of the pioneer women magistrates. During the First World War she had been the WTUL representative on the War Emergency Workers' National Committee and sat on many committees in addition to her work for the NFWW. Through her position as secretary to the queen's Work for Women Fund she struck up a working friendship with Queen Mary.<br>
<br>William Anderson died suddenly and prematurely in February 1919. In the following year Mary Macarthur made several trips to America, one as a British representative to the International Labour Organization. Although she was instrumental in negotiating the transfer of the NFWW into a mixed general union, the General and Municipal Workers' Union, she did not live to see this. She developed cancer in 1920 and after two unsuccessful operations died at home, 42 Woodstock Road, Golders Green, Middlesex, on new year's day 1921, being cremated at Golders Green crematorium three days later. She was only forty at her death. The Mary Macarthur Educational Trust and Mary Macarthur Homes for Working Women were established in her memory.<br>
<br>Mary Macarthur's contemporaries were well aware of her vitality, motivation, and ability to act as a catalyst for change. Gertrude Tuckwell, who first met her in 1903, commented that &#145;with Mary, something great was always going to happen, and she created an atmosphere in which it did&#146;  (<span class="italic">Labour Woman</span>). Nevertheless, both Gertrude Tuckwell and Mary Macarthur faced severe difficulties in organizing working-class women, who still encountered enormous obstacles to being accepted as an integral part of the workforce. As members of trade unions they allayed the suspicions of some male workers, but convincing most men and women of the importance of women's trade unionism was never an easy task, particularly for a woman from a middle-class background. At the same time some feminists were concerned about Mary Macarthur's sense of priorities, which was manifested, for example, in her commitment to adult suffrage. Yet her ability to work effectively with people of all classes facilitated her huge task and this, combined with her personal energy and commitment, helped to ensure the importance of the National Federation of Women Workers in peace and especially in war. As Beatrice Webb noted, Mary Macarthur was &#145;the axle round which the machinery moved&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
