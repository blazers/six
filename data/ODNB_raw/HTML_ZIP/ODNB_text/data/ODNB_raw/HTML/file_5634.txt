<span class="headword">Clevland,  Augustus</span>  (1754&#150;1784), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born in London on 19 September 1754, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64851/', "John Clevland (1706&#150;1763)")</script>, MP and secretary to the Admiralty, of Tapley, Devon, and his second wife, Sarah (<i>fl</i>. 1749&#150;1763), daughter of Richard Shuckburgh of Longborough, Gloucestershire. His eldest half-brother, John Clevland (1734?&#150;1817), followed his father into the Admiralty and was the MP for Barnstaple from 1766 to 1802. Augustus was one of the younger of John Clevland's seven surviving children and was still a child when his father died in 1763, heavily in debt to the Admiralty, but the Clevlands were well connected, and in 1770, after a brief course of financial instruction in Greenwich, Augustus secured a writership in the East India Company's Bengal establishment. His patron among the company's directors, Frederick Pigou (1711&#150;1792), former chief supercargo of Canton, was the patron also of his relation and intimate friend John Shore (1751&#150;1834), later first Lord Teignmouth and governor-general of Bengal.<br>
<br>Clevland arrived in India about 1771 and was appointed assistant collector of Bhagalpur; he was promoted to collector in 1775. Bhagalpur was a jungly district to the west of Bengal proper, agriculturally rich along the plains which straddled the Ganges, but bordered on the south-east and west by the Rajmahal and Kharakpur hills respectively. The hills were the preserve of aboriginal peoples&#151;&#145;tribals&#146;&#151;who were incorporated only loosely into the political and religious life of the plains, and who gave the district its ancient reputation for &#145;refractoriness&#146;. As collector, Clevland understood that he would never get more revenue from those who lived on the plains until he proved that the British could contain the hill peoples who frequently raided them. In spite of initial government scepticism, he persisted with a plan to conciliate the hill chiefs and their followers by creating a militia or corps of hill rangers which respected the internal authority of the chiefs and shielded them from the interference of the company's regular courts. Hill chiefs who joined Clevland's corps were rewarded with honours, cash, feasting, uniforms, and, eventually, firearms. The landlords of the plains mostly welcomed the initiative and the revenue collections increased accordingly, but some, such as the Rani Serbissery of Sultanabad, correctly perceived in Clevland's taming of the hills the loss of their own autonomy as well and turned themselves into outlaws rather than submit to company control. For the most part, however, Clevland's experiment was regarded as a triumph. The hill peoples entered British Indian imperial lore as the first in a long line of stereotypical &#145;loyal savages&#146;, while Clevland amassed increased authority on the strength of their pacification, including the exclusive right to oversee the administration of justice by the hill chiefs.<br>
<br>Clevland's other notable achievement was the creation of the first invalid <i>thana</i>, a settlement of invalided soldiers from the Bengal army designed to colonize marginal lands, thus extending the boundaries of company influence while also boosting the land revenue. Credit for the idea belongs to Captain James Browne, an officer in charge of the jungle tarai, but it was to Clevland that, in 1779, Warren Hastings, the governor-general, entrusted the first experiment. He began by settling over 180 retired Indian sepoys on the fringes of the Rajmahal hills, parcelling out to each settler a substantial tract of land, the size of which was determined by the rank he had attained in the army. Under his watchful eye, the newcomers soon formed a well-armed and disciplined buffer between the cultivators in the plains and the raiders of the hills. It was another, vital step in Clevland's mission to tame the hill frontier, and invalid <i>thanas</i> were soon established on other frontiers: they had become &#145;the vanguard of colonial expansion westwards&#146;  (Alavi, 101&#150;2).<br>
<br>Clevland was a brilliant administrator who combined ambition and seriousness of purpose with considerable personal charm and generosity. He quickly became a favourite of Warren Hastings, and Hastings's wife, Marian, descended on him for weeks at a time in his magnificent riverside mansion. Another visitor to enjoy Clevland's hospitality, and also his munificent patronage, was the painter William Hodges, who immortalized Clevland's hill rangers in paint and the &#145;ingenuity, address, and humanity&#146;  (Hodges, 90) of Clevland himself in his published reminiscences, <span class="italic">Travels in India</span> (1793).<br>
<br>The support of Hastings and also of John Shore, who was emerging as Bengal's foremost authority on land revenue, ensured that Clevland's demands for further powers were rarely disappointed. In 1783 he made his most far-reaching proposal yet, a request to be personally granted the revenue-collecting contract for the whole of Bhagalpur which, if allowed, would have turned him into a jungle king of <span class="italic">Heart of Darkness</span> proportions. The court of directors had explicitly forbidden revenue farming by company employees, but such was Clevland's reputation that Hastings's council agreed to ask the directors to waive the prohibition in his case. Before they could rule, however, Clevland sickened with fever and dysentery. In early 1784 he boarded the <i>Atlas</i>, bound for the Cape of Good Hope, but died at sea on 13 January 1784. He was twenty-nine. His body was returned to Calcutta and interred there on 30 January 1784 in the South Park Street burial-ground, where Hastings subsequently had a substantial monument erected to him at public expense. Shore penned a monodic lament on his lost cousin, and his estate, including twenty-one paintings by Hodges, was eventually sold off for funds to be remitted to his sisters and their children in Britain. He had never married. The most famous memorial to him, however, was the cairn erected at Bhagalpur out of Rs28,000 subscribed by local landlords. Forty years later, Bishop Heber found both the monument and local memory of Clevland intact; indeed, the longevity of Clevland's reputation acquired historical importance in itself. With his death, Bhagalpur's drift to personal rule was halted and the company gradually imposed more rigorous controls on the aspiring rajas in its service, but for advocates of a paternalistic, socially conservative imperialism, Clevland's example shone forth as the perfect means to conciliate a rude and savage people. The belief that his memory lived on in Bhagalpur was as reassuring to them as it was to the hill peoples who had originally accepted him as their overlord.<br>
