<span class="headword">Hole,  James</span>  (1819/20&#150;1895), <span class="occ">social reformer</span>, was probably the James Hole recorded as baptized at Manchester Cathedral on 27 February 1820, the son of James Hole and his wife, Ann. Census returns indicate that he was born in Manchester in 1819 or 1820; his marriage certificate describes his father, James, as a tailor. By the 1830s he was working for a cotton manufacturer and attending evening classes in Manchester, before moving in the early 1840s to become foreign correspondent and confidential clerk to a firm of Leeds stuff merchants. He was a man who generally shunned publicity, and little is known about his private life. In the mid-1840s he married Elizabeth Mitchell (<i>d</i>. 1884), with whom he had at least six sons and one daughter. Apparently an unsectarian and liberal Christian, he attended the Unitarian Mill Hill Chapel in Leeds and, among a number of translations, in 1864 he published anonymously the first English text of Ernest Renan's <span class="italic">The Life of Jesus</span>.<br>
<br>Hole was an important figure in progressive socialist, Owenite, and co-operative circles from the 1840s to the 1870s. His practical activism was largely confined to Leeds, where he was closely associated with the Leeds Redemption Society and influenced Samuel Smiles, but his writings gave him wider influence, and have been much quoted both for their insight into mid-nineteenth-century conditions and as examples of the contemporary critique of <i>laissez-faire</i> attitudes. As a leading figure in the Leeds District Flour Mill Society, a forerunner of the Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society of which he was a director from 1849, Hole was at the forefront of the transition of co-operation in Leeds from utopianism to practical reform. He was one of a number of figures, among them George Jacob Holyoake, who, although indebted to Robert Owen's emphasis on social reform, were, under the influence of a variety of factors including Ricardian socialism and the ideas of Carlyle and Emerson, and of Louis Blanc and Mazzini, attracted to the philosophy of &#145;associationism&#146;, with its stress on practical reform through voluntary organization. His writings and lectures on association were collected in <span class="italic">Lectures on Social Science</span> (1851).<br>
<br>Hole consistently advocated greater government intervention in areas where the market was clearly inefficient, such as education, but was above all concerned with promoting collective effort. Hence, although he played a role in the national debates which preceded the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1870, his <span class="italic">&#145;Light, More Light!&#146;: on the present state of education among the working classes of Leeds, and how it can best be improved</span> (1860) had greater impact on later accounts of the state of nineteenth-century education than on contemporary debates. His primary concern was always adult education. He was committee member and officeholder of the Leeds Mechanics' Institute (1847&#150;65) and the Leeds School of Art (1856&#150;65). His interest in &#145;technical education&#146; as this emerged as a distinct field resulted in his service on the West Riding educational board in the early 1860s, and contributions at meetings of the Royal Society of Arts. However, his significance particularly rests on his long service as honorary secretary of the Yorkshire Union of Mechanics' Institutes from 1848 to 1867. His annual reports formed the basis for an <span class="italic">Essay on the History and Management of Literary, Scientific and Mechanics' Institutes</span> (1853), which urged the importance of institute classes as a means of lifelong learning. In 1852 he started the Yorkshire Union Village Library, a scheme whereby book boxes were distributed to villages in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In 1867 Hole left Leeds to become organizing secretary of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, a position he held until his death in 1895, taking part in deputations to government, and in later years corresponding on behalf of the association with senior civil servants. He received a public testimonial in 1888. He was also a director and treasurer of Stubbs' Mercantile Agency. In 1893 he published <span class="italic">National Railways: an Argument for State Purchase</span>, which applied the social philosophy he had held consistently for most of his life to the position of the railways. He argued that <i>laissez-faire</i> when applied to the railways was wasteful, competition between companies producing unnecessary duplication and excessive hours of employment, and advocated the principle of equal mileage rates (a suggestion which attracted little support).<br>
<br>In London Hole continued to be active across a range of reforming movements. He served on the council of Henry Solly's Trades Guild of Learning in the early 1870s, and on the committee of management of the Central Co-operative Agency Society (1869&#150;74), and was later a supporter of the Guild of Co-operators. From the 1870s he was honorary secretary (and, according to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 February 1895, &#145;the most active promoter&#146;) of the Commons Preservation Society, which sought successfully to protect Epping Forest, Hampstead Heath, and various other London commons. He was also active in the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the People, which continued a long-standing interest in working-class housing, an interest which can be traced back to his participation in the founding of the Leeds Society for the Erection of Improved Dwellings. This organization purchased small plots of land and built model houses on them, before selling them on to working men at cost price. His <span class="italic">Homes of the Working Classes, with Suggestions for their Improvement</span> (1866) provides further evidence of his overriding concern with practicality, and his willingness to see an extension in the powers of central government, but also his increased recognition of the role of philanthropic landlords. By the time of his death Hole had himself accumulated a number of properties in Fulham, Putney, Hammersmith, Bermondsey, and Peckham.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife Hole married, on 23 December 1887, Emma Salmon (<i>b</i>. 1846/7), a widow. He died relatively suddenly at his home, 9 Iddesleigh Mansions, Victoria Grove, Westminster, London, on 17 February 1895, aged seventy-five. He was survived by his second wife, and was buried on 21 February at Honor Oak cemetery.<br>
