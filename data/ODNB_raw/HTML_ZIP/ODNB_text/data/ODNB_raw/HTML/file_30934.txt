<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clark,  Kenneth Mackenzie</span>, Baron Clark  (1903&#150;1983), <span class="occ">art patron and historian</span>, was born at 32 Grosvenor Square, London, on 13 July 1903, the only child of Kenneth Mackenzie Clark and his wife, (Margaret) Alice, daughter of James McArthur of Manchester and formerly of Paisley, a cousin of her husband on his mother's side. The father was a wealthy Scottish industrialist, sportsman, gambler, and ultimately alcoholic. The wealth derived from the well-known family textile firm Clark of Paisley, and was to provide his son throughout his career with a buoyancy that was an essential factor in the maintenance of his independence. The Clarks lived at Sudbourne Hall, Suffolk, and at Ardnamurchan, Argyll.<br>
<br>Clark was educated at Wixenford School and Winchester College, and won a scholarship to Trinity College, Oxford, where he gained a second class in modern history in 1925. A first class had been expected, but his interests had already turned conclusively to the study of art. An inborn sensitivity of response to works of art, together with an insatiable appetite for them, allied to an acute, fastidious, and articulate intelligence, had developed from childhood on. He was a workmanlike draughtsman himself, and read widely and voraciously. His introduction to the severer disciplines of close scholarship and analytic connoisseurship were provided at Oxford by Charles F. Bell, keeper of fine art, among the superb drawings and prints of the Ashmolean Museum. In autumn 1925 Bell introduced Clark to the renowned art historian Bernard Berenson at the latter's house, I Tatti, in the hills above Florence. Berenson gave the young man lunch and afterwards asked him to come to assist him in the revision of his great corpus of Florentine drawings.<br>
<br>There followed two years of concentrated practice and refinement of judgement of works of art together with Berenson in the library at I Tatti and in the great collections of Italy. Clark was, however, also discovering, in the course of completing his first full-length book, <span class="italic">The Gothic Revival</span> (the rather unexpected subject suggested by Bell, published in 1928), the exhilaration of prose composition, an art which (he was to observe later) was to yield him as much pleasure in life as anything he ever did.<br>
<br>In 1929 Clark was offered the enviable task of cataloguing the rich hoard of Leonardo da Vinci drawings at Windsor Castle. He also acted as joint organizer of an exhibition, which later became legendary, of Italian painting at the Royal Academy, involving masterpieces never seen before out of Italy. In 1931 his career took a decisive turn when he accepted Bell's former post, as keeper of the department of fine art at the Ashmolean, and became a full-time professional museum man. Less than three years later, at the unprecedently early age of thirty-one, he was appointed director of the National Gallery in London (1934&#150;45), and shortly afterwards became also surveyor of the king's pictures (1934&#150;44).<br>
<br>On 10 January 1927 Clark had married Elizabeth Winifred 
    (Jane; 1902/3&#150;1976)
  , daughter of Robert Macgregor Martin, a businessman of Dublin, and his wife, Emily Dickson, a medical doctor. Between 1934 and 1939, lodged in an almost palatial house in Portland Place, with his wife as president of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers and a leading hostess, the Clarks in joint alliance became stars of London high society, intelligentsia, and fashion, from Mayfair to Windsor. This was a period he later dubbed &#145;the Great Clark Boom&#146;.<br>
<br>In the National Gallery Clark made a considerable contribution. Acquisitions during his directorship included such masterpieces as Rubens's <span class="italic">Watering Place</span>, Constable's <span class="italic">Hadleigh Castle</span>, Rembrandt's <span class="italic">Saskia as Flora</span>, Ingres's <span class="italic">Mme Moitessier</span>, and Poussin's <span class="italic">Golden Calf</span>. He established a scientific department, and a carefully supervised programme of picture cleaning. In the art of administration, however, his touch failed with his senior staff, whom he alienated. Major crises occurred in 1937, culminating when&#151;against the united advice of his professional staff&#151;he persuaded the trustees to acquire four small minor Venetian school paintings and labelled them as Giorgiones. The subsequent controversy became public scandal, and contributed to a lingering mistrust of his integrity, especially among some fellow art historians, that was perhaps never quite dispelled. On the other hand, he fought off the reappointment of Lord Duveen as trustee, believing that a dealer's interests were irreconcilable with those of a trustee and that, although Duveen's natural charm and indeed generosity were compelling, they were matched by his natural duplicity.<br>
<br>In 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War, Clark was responsible for the evacuation of virtually the entire collection from London, ultimately into a cavern in the slate quarries of Manod in north Wales. In the emptied gallery he organized with Dame Myra Hess the very popular and morale-raising lunchtime music recitals that continued despite the blitz, and then a scheme by which he brought back one masterpiece each month for display. He also found time to serve in the Ministry of Information, first as director of the film division and then as controller of home publicity. Perpetually frustrated, however, by ministry bureaucracy, he resigned in 1941.<br>
<br>Clark was meanwhile establishing himself in the activity in which his greatest talents were to find their most congenial and successful employment. His catalogue of the Windsor Leonardo drawings (1935) still holds an honourable place in the Leonardo literature, but was to be his last exercise in what he came to term &#145;plodding scholarship&#146;. His monograph <span class="italic">Leonardo da Vinci &hellip; his Development as an Artist</span> (1939) established itself at once as the best general introduction in English, and was widely acclaimed. In 1945, following the successful return of the collections to the National Gallery, he resigned as director, to devote himself to his now paramount interest in writing. Between 1946 and 1950 he was Slade professor of fine art at Oxford, developing an already highly accomplished lecturing technique. For a more popular audience, he became known as a broadcaster in such programmes as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>. In the drab post-war years of austerity, a new public avid for the arts was emerging.<br>
<br>Clark had bought works of art for himself since his schooldays, but his generous and imaginative activity as collector&#150;patron was especially fruitful. Several artists, struggling in the 1930s and kept afloat by Clark, later became national and international figures, most notably Henry Moore, who like Graham Sutherland and John Piper were to become lifelong friends. In 1939&#150;40 Clark had been involved with the setting up of the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts. This, the first step towards state support for the living arts, subsequently became the Arts Council. As the council's third chairman (1953&#150;60), Clark underwent a frustrating experience. He felt little more than a figurehead, and his own commitment to the validity of state support of individual creative artists was ambivalent. His last appointment as a public administrator, as the first chairman of the Independent Television Authority (1954&#150;7), was more rewarding. The concept of commercial television, in rivalry with the BBC, was controversial, and so too was Clark's appointment, though his claim that he was subsequently booed at the Athenaeum is disputed. The prime task was to ensure the quality, balance, and political impartiality achieved by the licensed programme contractors. Almost at once Clark had to fight off an attempt by the government to use the new channels for its advantage. Clark was not averse to an injection of &#145;vulgar vitality&#146;, but managed to preserve a news service under the direct control of the authority rather than of the contractors. Though not reappointed in 1957, he had exercised a constructive and beneficent influence on the development of the British version of the most powerful instrument of mass communication yet known to mankind.<br>
<br>Clark's finest books, mostly allied to lecture series, were now behind him: <span class="italic">Piero della Francesca</span> (1951), <span class="italic">The Nude</span> (1956), from the Mellon lectures in Washington in 1953, and <span class="italic">Rembrandt and the Italian Renaissance</span> (1966), from the Wrightsman lectures in New York. He was now to emerge as an outstanding writer and performer for television. In 1966 the programme series <span class="italic">Civilisation</span> was mooted with the BBC and finally broadcast in 1969. Its success in English-speaking countries, and beyond, was spectacular and unparalleled; he became as celebrated as a film star, known to a wider audience personally than even John Ruskin had been a century before. Ruskin had been the greatest single influence on his mind since his schooldays, and he aspired to being Ruskin's heir in spreading the gospel of art, though with little of Ruskin's social, political, and moral involvement. His style too was very different; the prose in which the message was delivered was coolly lucid and elegantly lapidary but never rhapsodic. <span class="italic">Civilisation</span> was avowedly a very personal, selective interpretation and illustration of the title's grandiose theme. Although in it he ranged widely, with great erudition, in time and space, his conceptions generally were conditioned by Mediterranean values. The areas in the study of art&#151;psychological and philosophical, sociological, iconographical, scientific&#151;that challenged some of his most remarkable contemporaries, were generally not for him, though he acknowledged, for example, the influence of Felix (Aby) Warburg. Though he recognized the achievement of Mondrian, and even of Jackson Pollock, he did not respond generally to abstract art, and his primary concern was to arouse response in individual human beings to individual works of art, essentially by accounting for his own response. If he was in a sense old-fashioned, with a sensibility prone (though not in his prose) to tears and visionary flashes, he made art accessible to a whole generation as no other English-speaking writer was able to do.<br>
<br>Despite his proven qualities as a lecturer, that Clark was able to succeed so well in the demandingly personal medium of television appearances was to many unexpected. He proved able to achieve that most difficult balance on screen between the presenter's own presence and the object that he is presenting, never obscuring the object by his own brilliance. Though, in the interests of style, there might be &#145;an occasional sacrifice of the whole truth in the interests of economy&#146;, he did not talk down to his audience. Yet in private life, while often charming and entertaining, and imaginatively generous to younger students, for many he remained aloof and arrogant, and, even to some of his closest friends, elusive behind an impenetrable urbanity. Probably he was most relaxed in self-revelation only with a few gifted women, in particular, in the earlier days of his marriage, with his first wife. His loyalty to her in the later distress of her prolonged decline from health due to alcoholism caused his friends both admiration and embarrassment. His two autobiographical volumes are elegantly and subtly polished, at times very moving, often very funny, ironical, entertaining, and perceptive, if somewhat distanced, as if about someone else. There is modesty but little searching self-examination.<br>
<br>Clark was of medium height, slender, and elegantly tailored, then thickening somewhat in later life and becoming more relaxed in dress. His head was handsomely browed and aquiline, although in repose his features could too easily (and not necessarily accurately) convey the impression that he was looking down his nose. He was much honoured, being made a KCB in 1938, FBA in 1949, CH in 1959, and receiving a life peerage in 1969, and the Order of Merit in 1976. He was chancellor of York University from 1969 to 1979, and a trustee of the British Museum. Honorary degrees, fellowships, and distinctions were conferred on him by universities and academies in Britain, America, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Austria, and Finland, but the honour he cherished most was his appointment to the Conseil Artistique des Mus&eacute;es Nationaux, Paris.<br>
<br>Clark's first wife died in 1976; they had a son and a twin son and daughter. The elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72838/', "Alan Clark")</script>, became a military historian and Conservative politician. On 24 November 1977 Clark married Nolwen Louise Marie Alixe (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), former wife of Edward Rice, cattle and sheep farmer, and daughter of Frederic, comte de Janz&eacute;; she survived him. Clark died in Hythe Surgical Clinic, North Road, Hythe, Kent, on 21 May 1983. At the close of a crowded memorial service in St James's, Piccadilly, most of the congregation were startled to hear that in the last days of his life he had been received into the Roman Catholic church.<br>
