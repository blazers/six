<span class="headword">Carritt,  (Hugh) David Graham</span>  (1927&#150;1982), <span class="occ">art historian and picture dealer</span>, was born at 2 Royal Avenue, Chelsea, London on 15 April 1927, the only son of Reginald Graham Carritt, a lecturer in music, and his wife, Christian Norah Begg. He had two sisters, one older, the other his twin. Arriving at preparatory school, he was told he might have one magazine subscription. He asked for <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, which he had been enjoying in bound volumes since he was five or six, in his grandfather's library. He was sent to Rugby School when twelve. Starved of beautiful things to look at, he wrote to owners of collections within bicycle range, asking if he might visit.<br>
<br>Carritt won an open scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, where he took a third-class degree in modern history (1948). While at Oxford he caught the attention of Benedict Nicolson, editor of the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>. Nicolson took his prot&eacute;g&eacute; to visit the art historian Bernard Berenson in Florence&#151;&#145;The finest eye of his generation&#146;, was Berenson's considered judgement.<br>
<br>Always a Londoner, Carritt settled first in a flat over a dairy in Mayfair, working as a private dealer and writing not only for the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, but also for the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. In 1964 he joined Christies' old master paintings department, where he played a large part in reviving the fortunes of the firm; and in 1970 he set up David Carritt Ltd, owned by the international art-investment company of Artemis. Here, in his later years, he mounted a number of small and very personal exhibitions.<br>
<br>For a quarter of a century, between 1952 when he discovered a Caravaggio (<span class="italic">The Concert</span>, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) in a retired naval officer's house, and 1977 when he saw that a picture (<span class="italic">Psyche Showing her Sisters her Gifts from Cupid</span>, National Gallery, London) catalogued as by Carle van Loo in Lord Rosebery's Mentmore collection sale was in fact an early J. H. Fragonard, Carritt dazzled the art world and intrigued the general public with a series of detective feats remarkable for their number, variety, and importance. &#145;Connoisseurs agree&#146;, stated the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, &#145;that he had no peer, and has no successor&#146;.<br>
<br>Carritt himself took most pleasure in his discovery of a painting by Rogier van der Weyden (<span class="italic">St Ivo</span>[?], National Gallery, London) at the cottage of Joan, Lady Baird. This beautiful picture was not just lost; it was unrecorded. Its attribution to van der Weyden entailed much pacing round the Flemish rooms of the National Gallery. He also attributed the Tiepolo allegory fixed to a ceiling of the Egyptian embassy in London, scanned by countless pairs of eyes before his comprehended it. There was a fictional flavour to his discovery of five large and very dirty Francesco Guardi canvases rolled up like linoleum in a Dublin shed. In 1956, when he was still in his twenties, a photograph in the Courtauld Library recalled to Carritt a drawing in Hamburg, on the basis of which he attributed to D&uuml;rer a painting held to be by a minor Veronese master.<br>
<br>Carritt published little, but devoted much effort to other men's causes. Pierre Rosenberg, for example, in the catalogue of the Paris Chardin exhibition of 1979, acknowledged his very significant contribution to that great enterprise.<br>
<br>In the earlier days, when he practised regularly, Carritt was an excellent pianist, and his knowledge of the baroque and Viennese classics was thorough. He was a witty and indiscreet talker. Friends relished his cooking. Colleagues agreed that he was no businessman. Friends and colleagues united in admiration of his courage when in the grip of cancer. He died on 3 August 1982 at his flat at 120 Mount Street, London. He never married.<br>
