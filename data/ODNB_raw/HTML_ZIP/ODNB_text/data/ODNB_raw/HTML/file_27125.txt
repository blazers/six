<span class="headword">Templeton,  John</span>  (1766&#150;1825), <span class="occ">naturalist</span>, was born at Bridge Street, Belfast, co. Antrim, Ireland, the son of James Templeton (<i>d</i>. 1790), a wholesale merchant, and Mary Eleanor, daughter of Benjamin Legg of Malone. He was a &#145;delicate&#146; boy:<blockquote>my experience was &hellip; for many years very precarious during some of the infantile diseases. I have heard that the lamp of life was so nearly extinguished that final hope was exhausted, and I was left until a coffin should be prepared. (Deane, 33)</blockquote>He was educated at the school established by David Manson (1726&#150;1792), an innovative schoolmaster and brewer, whose pupils were taught &#145;to read and understand the English tongue, without the discipline of the rod, by intermixing pleasurable and healthy exercise with their instruction&#146;  (Manson, 3).<br>
<br>The Templetons' business evidently prospered, and John Templeton may be described as a man of independent means; if he had any role in running the family business, the fact is never mentioned by biographers. After his father's death he lived in the family's country house, Orange Grove, about 2 miles from Belfast, renaming it Cranmore (<i>crann m&oacute;r</i>, great tree) after the sweet chestnut (<i>Castanea sativa</i>) trees that still survive two centuries later. He had become a keen gardener about 1786, and in 1793 laid out an elaborate garden at Cranmore. Templeton's interest in botany arose in 1790, according to Thomas Dix Hincks, from a need to eradicate weeds from Cranmore. He became an extraordinary plantsman, growing exotic and native plants, raising trees from seeds, and experimenting by cultivating tender plants outdoors; he was probably the first to grow <i>Camellia</i> and <i>Fuchsia</i> in the open air in Ireland. Hincks stated that Templeton contributed information to Thomas Martyn's edition of Philip Miller's <span class="italic">The Gardener's and Botanist's Dictionary</span> (1807).<br>
<br>Templeton's political views were liberal. He supported parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, and the ideals of the United Irishmen although he did not agree with their methods. Among his close friends was a founder of the Society of United Irishmen, Thomas Russell, who was executed on 10 October 1803 at Downpatrick. A. Wilson wrote that &#145;among the little group [of Belfast citizens] whose liberal interest raised the whole outlook of the community none was a more remarkable personality than John Templeton&#146;  (Wilson, 104). He was a co-founder of the <span class="italic">Belfast Monthly Magazine</span> (1808&#150;14), and regularly contributed articles on natural history and meteorology. An active supporter of learned societies as well as philanthropic organizations, Templeton was one of the promoters of the Belfast Academical Institution and a member of its first board of visitors. He joined the Belfast Society for Promoting Knowledge (founded in 1788 as the Belfast Reading Society) and helped compile catalogues (1793 and 1818) of its library, later the Linen Hall Library. Templeton was appointed curator of the society's museum which was handed over in 1833 to the Belfast Natural History Society; he was made an honorary member of that society soon after its formation in 1821. He was a member of the Irish Harp Society, vice-president of the Belfast Literary Society (1803), and an associate of the Linnean Society of London (1794).<br>
<br>Templeton was a careful observer and a painstaking and accurate artist; he was interested in all aspects of the natural world. As a young man he went fowling but gave it up after observing the suffering of a wounded bird. He was also keen on fishing and his illustration of the extinct Lough Neagh char is a unique record. His extant diaries (1806&#150;25, in the Ulster Museum, Belfast) record the general weather and temperature at 8 a.m. daily, the flowering of plants, the planting of crops, and the calling of birds. While Templeton rarely ventured outside Ulster, he made frequent excursions by himself and with fellow naturalists around the north of Ireland to collect plants; among those known to have accompanied him are Robert Brown (1773&#150;1858) and Dr William Jackson Hooker (1785&#150;1865). Brown chose an Australian shrub belonging to the bean family (Fabaceae) to name <i>Templetonia</i> after his friend.<br>
<br>Templeton visited London on several occasions and, according to Hincks, following his second visit to London, Sir Joseph Banks offered him a grant of land and salary if he would go to New Holland. Templeton declined because of his &#145;attachment to his aunt and sisters &hellip; as well as to his native country&#146;  (Hincks, 406). On 21 December 1799 he married Katherine Johnson (<i>c</i>.1773&#150;1868), daughter of another Belfast merchant, Robert Johnson. The couple had five children; their only son, Robert (1802&#150;1892), studied medicine and became an expert entomologist and conchologist. Templeton died in Belfast on 15 December 1825 and was buried in Clifton Street burying-ground.<br>
<br>Templeton's most memorable discovery was the hybrid Irish rose, which he named <i>Rosa &times; hibernica</i>, at Holywood, co. Down, about 1795, yet this rose is only one of many plants and animals he recorded. He published papers on peat bogs, bird migration, and acclimatizing plants, but his observations remain essentially unpublished, incorporated in the copious manuscripts, often beautifully illustrated with sketches and watercolour paintings of native plants and animals, that are extant. Robert Lloyd Praeger described him as &#145;the most eminent naturalist Ireland has produced&#146;  (Praeger, 165) but added that little is known about him. Templeton was certainly influential during his lifetime, especially in his native city within scientific, literary, and social circles. He was a painstaking, comprehensive observer of a diverse range of plants and animals, and an accomplished all-round naturalist, but published little of substance.<br>
