<span class="headword">Bond,  Martin</span>  (1558?&#150;1643), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the third or fourth son of <a name="cosubject_2834"></a><span class="headword">William Bond</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1576), an <span class="occ">alderman of London and merchant adventurer</span>, who was sheriff in 1567. It is unclear whether he was the Martin Bond who, in 1572, was admitted to St Alban Hall, Oxford. Like his father he joined the Haberdashers' Company, obtaining his freedom in 1580. During the 1588 Armada campaign he served as a captain in the London militia, and was apparently among the forces assembled at Tilbury to meet the Spanish invasion. He subsequently travelled to Stade, in northern Germany, where, as a merchant adventurer, he traded in cloth for a short period before returning to England. His cloth business prospered, and during the Jacobean period he invested in the Spanish, Virginia, and Somers Island companies.<br>
<br>Settling in Aldgate ward, London, in a house leased from the corporation, Bond soon became a member of common council, and in 1606 was sufficiently trusted to be included in the small committee named to oversee the preparations for the visit to London of James I and his brother-in-law, the king of Denmark. But though he twice served as a London auditor, was briefly deputy governor of the Irish Society (1613&#150;14), and rose to the rank of deputy alderman (by 1626), he never attained the highest City offices, failing in several elections during the 1620s to unseat Cornelius Fish as chamberlain. His talents in the field of bookkeeping were nevertheless well regarded, for after two years' service as an auditor of St Bartholomew's Hospital, he was appointed its treasurer, which post he held for twenty-two years until his resignation in 1642 due to ill health. He also served as master of the Haberdashers' Company in 1624&#150;5, and was the first president of the Honourable Artillery Company (1616&#150;18). In addition he twice represented London in parliament (in 1624 and 1625), where he spoke in defence of the monopoly of the merchant adventurers against the criticisms of the outports. His financial expertise undoubtedly explains why he was named as one of the eight treasurers of the subsidies voted by parliament in 1624.<br>
<br>Dying unmarried, Bond was buried on 11 May 1643 in St Helen's Church, Bishopsgate, where his father lay interred, rather than in his own parish church, St Katharine Cree. He remained wealthy enough to make generous bequests to both the Haberdashers' Company and St Bartholomew's Hospital. His nephew William erected an impressive stone monument over his tomb to his &#145;piety, prudence and honesty&#146;, in which Bond was depicted as a young captain at Tilbury, sitting in armour in a tent, outside which a servant holds his horse and two sentries are on guard with matchlocks. His portrait in oils, by an unknown artist, has been preserved in the hospital, with a pewter inkstand bearing his arms.<br>
