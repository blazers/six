<span class="headword">Wilkins,  William Henry</span>  (1860&#150;1905), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, born at Compton Martin, Somerset, on 23 December 1860, was the son of Charles Wilkins, farmer, of Gurney Court, Somerset, and afterwards of Mann's Farm, Mortimer, Berkshire, where Wilkins passed much of his youth. His mother was Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keel. After private education, he was employed in a bank at Brighton; he then entered Clare College, Cambridge, in 1884 with a view to taking holy orders, and graduated BA in 1887, proceeding MA in 1899. At the university he developed literary tastes and interested himself in politics. An ardent Conservative, he spoke frequently at the union, of which he was vice-president in 1886. After leaving Cambridge he settled down to a literary career in London.<br>
<br>For a time Wilkins acted as private secretary to the earl of Dunraven, whose proposals for restricting the immigration of undesirable foreigners Wilkins embodied in <span class="italic">The Alien Invasion</span> (1892), with an introduction by R. C. Billing, bishop of Bedford. The <span class="roman">Aliens Act</span> of 1905 followed many of its recommendations. Also in 1892 he edited, in conjunction with Hubert Crackanthorpe, whose acquaintance he had made at Cambridge, a short-lived monthly periodical called <span class="italic">The Albemarle</span> (nine issues). He next published four novels (two alone and two in collaboration) under the pseudonym De Winton. <span class="italic">St. Michael's Eve</span> (1892; 2nd edn, 1894) was a serious society novel. Then followed <span class="italic">The Forbidden Sacrifice</span> (1893), <span class="italic">John Ellicombe's Temptation</span> (1894; with the Hon. Julia Chetwynd), and <span class="italic">The Holy Estate: a Study in Morals</span> (with Captain Francis Alexander Thatcher). With another Cambridge friend, Herbert Vivian, he wrote under his own name <span class="italic">The Green Bay Tree</span> (1894), which boldly satirized current Cambridge and political life and passed through five editions.<br>
<br>Wilkins's best literary work was done in biography. He formed a close acquaintance with the widow of Sir Richard Burton, and after her death wrote <span class="italic">The Romance of Isabel, Lady Burton</span> (1897), a sympathetic memoir founded mainly upon Lady Burton's letters and autobiography. Wilkins also edited in 1898, by Lady Burton's direction, a revised and abbreviated version of her <span class="italic">Life of Sir Richard Burton</span>, and her <span class="italic">Passion Play at Ober-Ammergau</span> (1900), as well as Burton's unpublished <span class="italic">The Jew, the Gypsy, and el Islam</span> (with preface and brief notes; 1898), and <span class="italic">Wanderings in Three Continents</span> (1901). These were poorly edited and Burton's executors did not ask him to undertake further work. Some years later, when Wilkins fell on hard times, Burton manuscripts appeared on the market and were traced back to Wilkins  (Lovell, 790).<br>
<br>Ill health did not deter Wilkins from original work in historical biography which involved foreign travel. Patient industry, an easy style, and good judgement atoned for a limited range of historical knowledge. At Lund University in Sweden he discovered in 1897 the unpublished correspondence between Sophie Dorothea, the consort of George I, and her lover, Count Philip Christopher K&ouml;nigsmarck, and on that foundation, supported by research in the archives of Hanover and elsewhere, he based <span class="italic">The Love of an Uncrowned Queen: Queen Sophie Dorothea, Consort of George I</span>, which was well received (2 vols., 1900; rev. edn 1903). Wilkins's <span class="italic">Caroline the Illustrious: Queen Consort of George II</span> (2 vols., 1901; new edn, 1904) had little claim to originality. <span class="italic">A Queen of Tears</span> (2 vols., 1904), a biography of Caroline Matilda, queen of Denmark and sister of George III of England, embodied researches at Copenhagen and superseded the previous biography by Sir Frederic Charles Lascelles Wraxall. For his last work, <span class="italic">Mrs. Fitzherbert and George IV</span> (2 vols., 1905), Wilkins had access, by Edward VII's permission, for the first time to the Fitzherbert papers at Windsor Castle, besides papers belonging to Mrs Fitzherbert's family. In 1901 he edited <span class="italic">South Africa a Century Ago</span>, valuable letters of Lady Anne Barnard, written from 1797 to 1801 while with her husband at the Cape of Good Hope. Wilkins also published <span class="italic">Our King and Queen <span class="roman">[Edward VII and Queen Alexandra]</span>: the Story of their Life</span> (2 vols., 1903), a popular book, copiously illustrated, and he wrote occasionally for periodicals. He died unmarried on 22 December 1905 at his home, 3 Queen Street, Mayfair, London, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
