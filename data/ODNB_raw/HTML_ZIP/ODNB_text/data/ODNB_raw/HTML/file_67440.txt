<span class="headword">Macdonnell,  Angus <span class="st"> [Aeneas]</span></span>, Lord Macdonnell and Aros  (<em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">chief of clan Macdonnell of Glengarry</span>, was the son of Alasdair (or Alexander) Macdonnell of Glengarry and Jean, daughter of Allen Cameron of Lochiel, chief of clan Cameron. He was brought up a Roman Catholic, although it is unclear if he remained so after the late 1640s. By 23 November 1641 his father had died, and Angus was the heir apparent of his grandfather Donald Macdonnell, chief of the Glengarry Macdonnells, and, since the latter was nearly 100 years old, effectively in charge of the clan. That day Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat, Skye, acted as cautioner to the sum of 10,000 merks that Macdonnell would appear in Edinburgh before the privy council within eight days, in connection with the murder on 15 August that year in Inverness of two followers of William Mackintosh of Torcastle by a group of Glengarry Macdonnells. The murderers had been put to the horn on 20 September, but failed to appear. Macdonnell refused to provide caution for the offenders and the council committed him to Edinburgh Castle. On 1 March 1642, after thirteen weeks in prison, he relented. Sir John Mackenzie of Tarbat acted as his cautioner for compliance to the sum of &pound;10,000 Scots. Between 29 October 1642 and 24 January 1643 Macdonnell and Torcastle sought to resolve the issue of compensation for the Mackintoshes; the former's supporters in the arbitration included Tarbat, Thomas Fraser of Strechine, and William Fraser of Culbokie. Some idea of the armament of the Glengarry clan comes from a letter, which refers to Macdonnell's retinue &#145;neir the parts of Innernes with blowin pipes, bowes, gunnes and other offensive weapons&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 2nd ser., 1.575&#150;6). The final judgment demanded that he pay 2300 merks to the victims' widows and orphans.<br>
<br>In December 1644 Macdonnell's grandfather sided with the royalist army of James Graham, marquess of Montrose, and Macdonnell, as effective military leader of the clan, took the field. His regiment fought in the centre of the royalist line at Montrose's victory at Inverlochy on 2 February 1645. That day his grandfather died and Angus became chief of the clan. In April he and his men served at the storming of Dundee and during the harrowing retreat from the burgh; on 9 May they helped the marquess win the desperate battle of Auldearn; on 2 July Glengarry commanded the centre of Montrose's army at the victory at Alford; and on 15 August he led 500 Macdonnells in the rout of covenanters at Kilsyth. In the next few months he allied with Alasdair MacColla MacDonald in attacking the covenanter Campbells in Argyll. On 8 September 1646 the synod of Argyll excommunicated him for being an unrepentant royalist, but by the end of that year he had ceased military operations and earned a pardon from the covenanter regime. In June 1647 he reluctantly led some clansmen to Ireland when Alasdair retreated at the approach of David Leslie's covenanter army, and joined the papal-Gaelic faction of the confederates at Charlemont, Armagh. Cardinal Rinuccini divided the force and sent Glengarry to serve with General Thomas Preston's Leinster army in an attempt to take Dublin. On 8 August at Dungan Hill the chief led a regiment to bloody defeat. Few of his men survived the battle, but Glengarry escaped and continued to serve with a contingent of Scots and Irish in the papalist faction. In October 1648 royalist confederates captured him and others in the battle of Wexford, but Randal Macdonnell, marquess of Antrim, successfully pleaded for his release. Glengarry now went into a double exile, travelling to the court of the prince of Wales on the continent. The covenanter regime forfeited him for his royalist and anti-Campbell actions in 1649.<br>
<br>Glengarry returned to Scotland with Charles II at Garmouth on 24 June 1650, and during the next decade played a large role in highland affairs. During the English rule of Scotland he stoutly opposed the conquerors. In mid-August 1652 he raised 4000 men, and, as acting general of the Scottish royalists, sent a messenger to Charles II. In September to October he headed a coalition of Macdonnells, Macleans, Macleods, Lovat Frasers, and other clans and requested the dispatch of arms and John Middleton as the official commander. On 22 January 1653 English intelligence reported that Glengarry had between 1500 and 2000 men, but that he had failed to hold a royalist conference. In mid-February his army disbanded. Following meetings of royalists in the highlands, Glengarry joined William Cunningham, earl of Glencairn's 1200-man army. By December, despite royalist successes, Glengarry and his allies had retreated into Badenoch. In early April 1654 Glencairn had over 5000 men, but rifts weakened the royalist rising. Glencairn wounded the professional soldier Sir George Monro (serving in his army) in a duel after the latter called the highlanders, chiefly the Glengarry Macdonnells, thieves and robbers. Glengarry himself became involved in a bitter dispute with John Murray, earl of Atholl, that nearly led to a duel when the latter's tenants paid taxes to the English. An earlier difference (spring 1653) with Archibald Campbell, Lord Lorne, over Glencairn's position as leader, nearly caused a duel in September. In October to December, with a warrant from Glencairn, Glengarry sought to arrest Lorne. This dispute eventually quieted down. Meanwhile Lochiel had become disenchanted with Glengarry for failing to make a royalist rendezvous, but instead meeting with the English Colonel William Brayne.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1653 Glengarry received a royal commission as major-general in Scotland. During the year Charles wrote that he had &#145;a very good opinion of his affection and ability to serve&#146;  (Firth, <span class="italic">Scotland and the Commonwealth</span>, 310&#150;11), but denied promising him the earldom of Ross. However, on 6 February 1654 the king issued a warrant to John Campbell, earl of Loudoun and chancellor, making Glengarry &#145;Lord MackDonald and Earle of&#146;  (Firth, <span class="italic">Scotland and the Protectorate</span>, 31). On 30 May Glengarry was noted as the &#145;only person for dyvers months that adhered to my Lord Glencarne&#146;  (ibid., 111). In August he was reputedly leading 1550 men. But by October&#150;November the Macdonnells had become reluctant to follow their chief, probably owing to the English laying waste to the clan lands. In December Glengarry failed in an attempt to rouse the Camerons to loyalty to the royalist cause. The following May he agreed to treat with the English. On 8 June he surrendered in hopes of securing an indemnity for his acts of 1644&#150;55. However, the English forfeited him, and gave his lands to Archibald Campbell, marquess of Argyll, who in turn granted them to Lochiel. In autumn 1656 General George Monck had the chief arrested owing to fears of a royalist rising. On 5 October 1658 Glengarry went to Inverlochy to hear Richard Cromwell proclaimed as lord protector. Between 12 August and 7 September 1659 he signed the engagement for peaceable behaviour with Monck. Nevertheless, some of his clansmen were in arms in November and had started robbing people, which caused the English to give Lochiel a commission against them.<br>
<br>The Restoration brought a positive uplift to Glengarry's fortunes. Although he failed in his attempt to secure the earldom of Ross, which would have given him precedence over all the other Macdonald chieftains, on 20 December 1660 he received a charter of nobility as Lord Macdonnell and Aros and in practice the Scottish government occasionally called him the leader of all MacDonalds. His military career for the Stuarts had burdened him with debts of &pound;148,000 Scots by 1661, but on 23 February that year the Scottish privy council granted him an annuity of &pound;300, which increased to &pound;500 on 7 February 1676. With his status enhanced and a degree of financial security achieved, Macdonnell became an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the court in London, a house near Inverness, and the parliament in Edinburgh. He attended the last in 1661, 1662, 1663, 1667, 1669, and 1670. On 15 April 1661 the estates overturned the forfeiture imposed on him in 1649. In 1662 it assigned him recompense for his losses as a royalist from the marquess of Argyll's forfeited estates. Parliament also recognized his local prominence by making him a commissioner of supply for Inverness-shire in 1667 and 1678.<br>
<br>However, the Restoration period was not without problems for the new peer. Macdonnell maintained a consistent hostility to certain parties&#151;chiefly the Campbells led by Archibald, ninth earl of Argyll&#151;until his death. In 1665 he joined the Macleans, the MacIans of Glencoe, the Camerons, and the MacDonalds of Keppoch in holding Mull against the earl. His feud with the burgh of Inverness in 1666 led the privy council to demand that both parties post caution of 20,000 merks for peaceful behaviour. In 1667 he found himself pursued by the council due to a charge from the earl of Seaforth. The earl claimed that Macdonnell had stopped a messenger from delivering a summons on 30 October 1667, and that twenty-four Macdonnells armed with swords, pistols, muskets, and dirks had threatened and robbed the messenger. In mid-February 1669 Macdonnell appeared at the council in Edinburgh and signed a bond for peaceable behaviour of his highlanders. Two weeks later, on 4 March, the council found Seaforth's charge unproven, and ordered the earl to pay Macdonnell &pound;600 Scots. In November 1670 Macdonnell was at feud with Cameron of Lochiel, and the council ordered both to keep the peace. His earlier troubles with the Mackintoshes continued; for on 18 July 1672 the council ordered Macdonnell to find caution of 5000 merks due to some of his clansmen troubling the laird of Mackintosh Torcastle. Unsurprisingly, Macdonnell's dispute with the Campbells endured. In 1674 he had joined with other MacDonalds, the MacQuarries, Camerons, and Macleans in opposing the earl of Argyll's quest to gain Mull. Nevertheless, on 18 September 1677 he managed to gain a commission for maintaining peace in the highlands at an annual stipend of &pound;200. The commission continued until mid-November 1678, but thereafter he refused to obey the council. His disobedience in the midst of fears of a highland dimension of the Popish Plot, which led to a council order for disarming Catholic clansmen, was definitely ill-timed. A herald's attempt to cite him to the council or be charged a rebel led to an attack on the official that Christmas at Invergarry by a group of Macdonnell men dressed as women. His fortunes plunged further on 12 April 1679 when the council gave Argyll a commission to pursue the now outlawed Lord Macdonnell. On 27 May the council declared him to be in rebellion, and on 14 August he suffered his third forfeiture. In 1679 Argyll finally managed to overrun Mull and the other Maclean lands, despite Macdonnell's opposition. The change in government (with the fall of Argyll's patron Lauderdale in August to October and the arrival of James, duke of York, as regent in December) rescinded the declarations against Macdonnell. Still, on 15 March 1680 he was publicly rebuked for threatening the lord treasurer in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Macdonnell had married in 1646 Margaret, eldest daughter of Sir Donald MacDonald of Sleat. They had a daughter who married Montgomery of Coilsfield, Ayrshire. Macdonnell died in Edinburgh on 6 December 1680, and was buried in Holyrood Abbey. Lacking a direct male heir, the peerage lapsed, and the chiefship fell to his nephew Ranald Macdonnell of Scotus. The judgements on Macdonnell's lengthy career were harsh, even from fellow royalists. Lochiel concluded, &#145;Glengarry &hellip; had he behaved himself with the same integrity to his neightbours [<i>sic</i>] as he did to his Prince, he had dyed with a very unblemished character&#146;  (Cameron, 259&#150;60). The leading seventeenth-century Gaelic poet Ian Lom MacDonald also condemned him:<blockquote>You seem to me to be along time in England, being ruined by gaming. I would prefer you in a coat and plaid than in a cloak which fastens; and that you would walk in a sprightly manner in trews made of tartan cloth and visit for a spell in grassy Glenquoich [the glen in the midst of the clan lands]. (Macinnes, 128)</blockquote>
