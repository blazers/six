<span class="headword">Wailes,  Reginald <span class="st"> [Rex]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1986), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at Hadley Wood, Middlesex, on 6 March 1901, the elder son of Reginald Percy Wailes and his wife, Florence. Though baptized Reginald, he used Rex as his first name. He was educated at Oundle School where his enthusiasm for history won him the school prize in that subject. From school he proceeded to an apprenticeship with Robey &amp; Co. of Lincoln as a precursor to his employment in the family firm of George Wailes &amp; Co. in London. This firm had been founded by his grandfather and was employed in the manufacture of castings, machinery, and equipment. The nearby University College was a major customer, ordering items for research projects, and machinery, and several models were made for the Science Museum.<br>
<br>Wailes joined George Wailes &amp; Co. in 1924, became manager in 1940, and continued to manage the firm until 1960 when it was compulsorily closed for the widening of the Euston Road. The company had a good reputation for sound and careful workmanship, and during the Second World War was busy with wartime production. In 1930 he married Enid Berridge, a professional violinist; they had two daughters. He served as an associate member of the council of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers from 1934 until 1937, when he became a fellow.<br>
<br>Wailes is best known for his authoritative work on windmills. When he was with Robey &amp; Co. he received a request from K. J. Tarrant for information about Lincolnshire windmills, and because of his work on the subject was invited in 1925 to join the Newcomen Society for the Study of the History of Engineering and Technology. During his long membership of this society he presented forty-three papers of which all but three were devoted to windmills. Two of his books&#151;<span class="italic">Windmills in England</span> (1948) and <span class="italic">The English Windmill</span> (1954)&#151;are models of his careful study of the way in which windmills have come into being and have developed over the centuries. The Newcomen Society honoured him by making him its president from 1953 to 1955 and by electing him as an honorary member in 1977. As a committee member in the society's earlier years he was responsible for much of its sound development.<br>
<br>In 1929 the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings was persuaded by the national press to add windmills to its working brief and Wailes was invited to assist as the honorary technical adviser on windmills. Two years later the windmill section came into being and since 1946 has been the wind and watermill section. Wailes was made president of the section in 1978 having served on its committee since its inception.<br>
<br>When Wailes retired on the closure of the family firm he became consultant to the Industrial Monuments Survey, firstly under the Council for British Archaeology but, after 1969, under the aegis of the then Ministry of Public Building and Works. He was made OBE in the new year's honours list in 1974. He also contributed to international work on windmills. He attended the first symposium of the International Molinological Society in 1965 and presented papers to the first four symposia. He supervised the reconstruction of the windmill at colonial Williamsburg in Virginia and advised on the watermill at Sleepy Hollow on the Hudson River.<br>
<br>Rex Wailes was admired for the care with which he encouraged others working in the same field, and in many instances helped to train them. His courtesy, humour, and love of music were strong elements in his relationship with all who knew him. He died at Davidge Cottage, Knotty Green, Beaconsfield, where he had lived throughout his married life, on 7 January 1986. He was survived by his wife.<br>
