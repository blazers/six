<span class="headword">Hickes,  George</span>  (1642&#150;1715), <span class="occ">bishop of the nonjuring Church of England and antiquary</span>, was born at Moorhouse, Newsham, in the parish of Kirby Wiske near Thirsk in Yorkshire, on 20 June 1642, the second son of William Hickes, originally of Ness in the parish of Stonegrave, Yorkshire, a landowning farmer at Moorhouse, and his wife, Elizabeth Kay (or Key), daughter of George Kay, rector of nearby Topcliffe. Hickes was the fourth child of seven and had two brothers, an elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13204/', "John Hickes (1633&#150;1685)")</script>, later a nonconformist minister, and Ralph Hickes (<i>c</i>.1651&#150;1711), who became a physician. After some time at school in Thirsk, Hickes, when aged about ten, was sent to the free school of Northallerton where he was taught by the royalist schoolmaster Thomas Smelt. The devotional writer John Kettlewell, later Hickes's close friend, was also a pupil of Smelt's at Northallerton. Smelt taught and reinforced the loyalist principles traditionally adhered to by the family of Hickes's mother. To his later friend and biographer, Hilkiah Bedford, Hickes remembered in admiration that:<blockquote>He [Smelt] was wont to take all occasions from the Classick Authors to instill into his upper boys due notions of the sacred Majesty of Kings, &amp; the wickedness of Usurpers, as his scholar G. H. us'd frequently to mention, particularly what he us'd to say of Agathocles in Justin's <span class="italic">History</span> by whom they all understood that he meant the then Protector. In his upper Class which read Homer, he us'd to take occasion from that Author to speak of Kings as God's Ministers &amp; Vice-gerents, &amp; not the People's, to whom they were not accountable. (Bedford, 2)</blockquote>Hickes was to suffer considerably from his father's adherence to Cromwell and often felt he had to compensate for this &#145;sin&#146; of rebellion &#145;by doing the utmost in his power through the whole course of his life to serve the Royal cause &amp; that of the Church, which had been so much disserv'd by his father&#146;  (ibid., 5). In 1658 Hickes went to live with his brother John, then minister of Saltash, Cornwall, and was bound apprentice to a Plymouth merchant. However, John realized his younger brother's &#145;genius was to learning, &amp; not to trade&#146;  (ibid., 3). After consulting George Hughes, rector of Plymouth, John advised his father to send George to Oxford, where he entered St John's College as a battler in April 1659.<h2>
<a name="EarlycareertheRestorationOxfordscholarstravelabroadandthechurchinScotland"></a>Early career: the Restoration, Oxford scholars, travel abroad, and the church in Scotland</h2>Under the puritan president, Thankful Owen, Hickes refused to take sermon notes or attend young scholars' meetings for spiritual exercises, his royalist Anglicanism making him despair of a university education. Attending the visitation following the restoration of Charles II, however, Hickes decided to stay at Oxford and migrated to Magdalen College as servitor to Henry Yerbury, one of the restored fellows. On 24 February 1663 he graduated BA, after which he migrated to Magdalen Hall. On 23 May 1664 he obtained the Yorkshire fellowship of Lincoln College, and he proceeded MA on 8 December 1665. He became deacon on 10 June and priest on 23 December the next year. From about 1665 to 1673 Hickes worked as a tutor of Lincoln College. He was incorporated at Cambridge on 8 July 1668. It was during this early period of some seven years at Lincoln that he laid the foundations for his later career as a leading philologist and Anglo-Saxon scholar.<br>
<br>At Lincoln College, Hickes met the linguistic scholar Thomas Marshall, who had been appointed a fellow in 1668 after his publication, together with his teacher Francis Junius (Fran&ccedil;ois du Jon), of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon versions of the gospels, including Marshall's <span class="italic">Observationes in evangeliorum versiones perantiquas duas, Gothicas scil. et Anglo-Saxonicas</span> (Dordrecht, 1665). Marshall, in correspondence, also introduced Hickes to John Fell, canon and dean of Christ Church and vice-chancellor of the university. Fell, a strong university man and renovator of the university press, together with other scholars that he grouped around him (Edward Bernard, Samuel Clarke, Henry Dodwell, John Pearson, and others), was responsible for a revival of patristic, historical, and philological learning. In the early 1670s he commissioned Marshall, then living in the Netherlands, to acquire punches, matrices, and type for the newly built printing house, the Sheldonian Theatre. Through Fell, and also on the advice of Hickes, Marshall subsequently became rector of Lincoln in 1672. In those years a need began to be felt for a new Anglo-Saxon dictionary and grammar (William Somner's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span>, including Aelfric's grammar, of 1659, was hardly available at the time). Among his other language studies Marshall set to work on such a grammar (Bodl. Oxf., MS Marshall 78). Inevitably Hickes was influenced by and indebted to these efforts by Junius, Fell, and Marshall.<br>
<br>However, for the time being Hickes's interest in philology was cut short when he fell seriously ill and was advised to rest. To recuperate he travelled abroad in October 1673, accompanying one of his former Lincoln College students, Sir George Wheler, a royalist scholar and traveller, on part of his grand tour. At Wheler's invitation Hickes visited Paris, Blois, Montpellier, N&icirc;mes, Marseilles, Lyons, and Geneva among other places. In Paris Hickes met the eminent protestant scholar Henri Justell who (before the revocation of the edict of Nantes) told Hickes &#145;many secret matters, particularly that of the intended persecution of the Hugonots, &amp; of a design in Holland &amp; England to extirpate the Royal Family of the Stewarts&#146;  (Bedford, 8). Through Hickes, Justell, secretary to Louis XIV and later Charles II's librarian at St James's, presented his father's valuable late sixth-century manuscripts of acts and canons of the early church to the Bodleian Library (MSS e Museo 100&#150;102). At Geneva the Anglican Hickes refused the protestant sacrament from Fran&ccedil;ois Turretin because he doubted its validity. However, his sermon <span class="italic">The True Notion of Persecution</span> (1681) shows that Hickes also felt somewhat sympathetic to the cause of the persecuted Huguenots whom he did not wish to associate with the English dissenters. <span class="italic">A Letter from beyond the Seas to One of the Chief Ministers of the Non-Conforming Party</span> (1674) was Hickes's anonymous letter to his dissenting brother John, written from Saumur. Hickes returned to England in 1674.<br>
<br>Hickes proceeded BD at Oxford on 14 May 1675 while he was rector of St Ebbe's Church. In the same year his friend John Kettlewell was elected fellow of Lincoln College, largely through his influence. He preached a sermon (published as <span class="italic">Peculium Dei</span>, 1681) at St Mary's &#145;to confute the many dangerous doctrines &amp; opinions antient &amp; modern, grounded upon the misunderstanding of the Jewish Oeconomy &amp; the Mosaick Law&#146;  (Bedford, 33), for which he was praised by Richard Allestree, regius professor of divinity, and Kettlewell. In August 1676 Hickes met the learned and controversial John Maitland, second earl and first duke of Lauderdale, who offered him a chaplaincy. Maitland, who had considerable influence on King Charles II, was on his way to Edinburgh as secretary of state for Scotland to safeguard constitutional affairs against the interests of the Scots covenanters and defend the re-established episcopal church against Scottish presbyterianism. After consulting John Fell, by then bishop of Oxford, Hickes accepted the position despite some misgivings concerning Maitland's debauched courtly lifestyle. In Scotland it was Hickes's task to introduce the liturgy and support Maitland's policies. Thus Maitland commissioned Hickes's <span class="italic">Ravillac redivivus</span> (1678), an account of the trial of the covenanter James Mitchell, who had attempted to assassinate James Sharpe, the archbishop of St Andrews. Through Sharpe, Hickes was offered a DD at St Andrews for this work. That same year Hickes together with Alexander Burnet, archbishop of Glasgow, reported to the court in London on Scottish ecclesiastical affairs.<br>
<br>Besides these official duties Hickes continued to pursue philology and antiquarian interests&#151;as is evident, for example, from his correspondence with Thomas Smith, then chaplain to Sir Joseph Williamson, secretary of state. Williamson founded a collegiate lectureship in Saxon studies at Queen's College, Oxford, for William Nicolson in 1679. Hickes also appears to have studied Hebrew to be able to discuss &#145;Rabbinical learning&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.268) with Maitland. His <span class="italic">Ravillac</span> also betrayed his steady interest in Anglo-Saxon etymology and English dialects. Hickes stayed for some time with Maitland at Ham House, Surrey, where he met William Hopkins, prebendary of Worcester, who was improving the cathedral library at Worcester and who had visited Sweden to study the septentrional languages.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1679 Hickes married Frances Marshall (<i>c</i>.1633&#150;1714), daughter of Charles Mallory of Rainham, Essex, and widow of John Marshall, citizen of London. Frances had a royalist background. They had no children. On 17 December that year Hickes was created Oxford DD. He was at the beginning of a promising career in the established church.<h2>
<a name="AcareerindefenceoftheRestorationchurch16801687"></a>A career in defence of the Restoration church, 1680&#150;1687</h2>For the next seven years Hickes preached and published on ecclesiastical controversies and developed his patristic scholarship. In the aftermath of the Popish Plot Hickes preached several sermons in the prevailing anti-Catholic climate, among them <span class="italic">The Spirit of Popery Speaking out of the Mouths of Phanatical Protestants</span> (1680) for which, as well as for his service in Scotland, he was given a prebendary of Worcester by the king. Also in 1680 Archbishop Sancroft presented him to the vicarage of All Hallows Barking. In the next year Hickes gave up his fellowship of Lincoln, becoming chaplain to Charles II. <span class="italic">A Sermon Preached on the 30th of Jan</span> (1682) on the Anglican doctrines of divine right, passive obedience, and non-resistance caused consternation among dissenters in the church of St Mary-le-Bow and publication was resisted (unsuccessfully) by the court of aldermen. In the same year, 1682, a work was published of seminal importance to the revival of Anglican patristic theology and scholarship which was deeply to influence Henry Dodwell, Hickes, and the nonjuring movement after the revolution of 1688. To the nonjurors John Fell's edition of St Cyprian showed that the principles of primitive Christianity (the Cyprianic principles) paralleled those of the post-Reformation episcopal Church of England envisioned as a divine society with independent jurisdiction in spiritual matters. Also in 1682 Hickes's sermon <span class="italic">A Discourse of the Sovereign Power</span> was answered by <span class="italic">Julian the Apostate</span> (1682) by the nonconformist Samuel Johnson. Hickes was becoming aware of increasing opposition to his Restoration principles, especially from John Tillotson, then dean of Canterbury. At Sancroft's request Hickes answered Johnson with <span class="italic">Jovian</span> (1683). In these years (1681&#150;4), in the aftermath of the exclusion crisis, the influential commission for ecclesiastical promotions elected bishops and deans who could be trusted to be loyal to the king's brother and heir, James, duke of York. Hickes was promoted to the deanery of Worcester in August and installed on 13 October 1683. He declined the bishopric of Bristol the following year.<br>
<br>In 1685 Thomas Marshall died and Hickes wished to succeed him as rector of Lincoln College. He obtained Fell's support but was not elected. According to Anthony Wood, John Radcliffe thought Hickes &#145;a turbulent man and that if he should be rector they should never be at quiet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times</span>, 3.142). In April that year Hickes attended the coronation of the Catholic King James II. The year ended tragically for him when on 6 October his brother John was executed for his involvement in Monmouth's rebellion. Hickes had tried but failed to obtain a pardon. After his father's &#145;sin&#146; of rebellion, he had to contend once again in a most personal way with the moral forces of familial love and belief in non-resistance. In 1686 Hickes resigned All Hallows and became rector of Alvechurch, near Worcester. His Stuart loyalties were firm, but so was his anti-Catholicism. Early that year he had preached a sermon, <span class="italic">An Apologetical Vindication of the Church of England</span> (published 1687), for which he was summoned to the king. Hickes had cast suspicion on the so-called strong box papers, but James proved to him that Charles II's papers on his conversion to Catholicism were genuine. James proceeded with his campaign to put Catholics in Oxford colleges. After Fell's death the Catholic convert John Massey succeeded to the deanery of Christ Church, and at Magdalen a Catholic president was appointed. In 1687 Hickes opposed the declaration of indulgence that granted full freedom of religious observance to Catholics and protestant dissenters. When Bishop William Thomas of Worcester was ill Hickes publicly declared that he would not summon the chapter to elect a Catholic successor on his death.<h2>
<a name="ReligionandpoliticstheSaxonscholarshipofanoutlaw16881699"></a>Religion and politics: the Saxon scholarship of an outlaw, 1688&#150;1699</h2>
<blockquote>[Hickes] was no sooner settled at Worcester but being then about 45 years of age he apply'd himself to the study of the ancient Septentrional Languages, of which by indefatigable pains he made himself a perfect Master in one year, &amp; at the same time compiled his Anglo-Saxon &amp; Moeso-Gothick Grammar. (Bedford, 22)</blockquote>For Hickes the affairs of English politics and religion came together with his historical and linguistic studies in the years leading up to the revolution of 1688&#150;9. One of Fell's earlier cherished plans had been a publication of Junius's Old English&#150;Latin dictionary, based on the Junius manuscripts which had come to the Bodleian in 1677 together with the Junius fount of type. The dictionary was to be accompanied by Marshall's Saxon grammar. After Marshall's death this task devolved upon William Nicolson, who had copied the Junius manuscripts with a view to publication but had left for Cumberland in 1681 (Nicolson's copy would come to the Bodleian in Fell's collection in 1686). According to Hickes's later friend, the Saxonist Edward Thwaites, Fell subsequently assigned the grammar to Hickes. At Worcester, where the cathedral library was rich in Saxon charters and where his association with William Hopkins was renewed, Hickes continued his philological studies and mastered Anglo-Saxon. Hickes now had access to the newly acquired Junius manuscripts at Oxford and was influenced by Junius's ideas about the history of the Germanic languages. With the encouragement and support of Arthur Charlett, delegate of Oxford University Press, and the scholar John Mill, Hickes's Old English grammar was printed (using Junius's type) and published at Oxford as <span class="italic">Institutiones grammaticae Anglo-Saxonicae et Moeso-Goethicae</span> (1689); yet not without Mill's drastic curtailment of Hickes's dedication to the by then suspended Archbishop Sancroft. In the following decade ecclesiastical and scholarly interests were combined and inextricably connected in Hickes's life in a manner characteristic both of antiquarian research in general and of Hickes's methods as one of its leading proponents. Hickes &#145;belonged in a sense to an age earlier than that in which he lived, since his mind, encyclopedic in its range, refused to specialize and so entangled his learning with his life, that it is difficult to regard him solely as an historian or philologist, or solely as a divine&#146;  (Douglas, 78).<br>
<br>With the confusion among scholars, clergy, and lawyers attending the unprecedented circumstance after the revolution of both a king <i>de facto</i> (William) and a king <i>de jure</i> (James II), several ideological theories on the settlement and kingship were expounded. Hickes's <span class="italic">Institutiones</span> was undertaken as he wrote later &#145;purely out of zeale to make known the Language, Customes, Laws, and manners of our ancestres, and so to set our English antiquities in a good light&#146;  (Harris, <span class="italic">Chorus of Grammars</span>, 402). Nevertheless Hickes made a political statement by presenting in the same work a Saxon coronation oath (copied from Bodl. Oxf., Junius MS 60) as historical evidence of divinely ordained kingship that invalidated, in his view, whig historians' arguments about the &#145;original contract&#146; between the king and his people as a basis of good government, a contract which justified resistance (or even active rebellion) if a king proved to be a tyrant.<br>
<br>On 1 August 1689 Hickes was, as dean of Worcester, suspended for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary. On 1 February 1690 he was deprived but remained in possession until May 1691 when William Talbot was granted the deanery by King William. Hickes refused to accept his deprivation and wrote a claim of right which he pinned over the entrance to the choir in Worcester Cathedral. Soldiers took the document down and sent it to Daniel Finch, second earl of Nottingham and secretary of state. A warrant for high misdemeanour was issued after a debate in the council. Hickes's house was searched but Hickes had gone into hiding in London; he was outlawed on 11 August 1691.<br>
<br>In the following years Hickes further pursued his philological studies in correspondence with Arthur Charlett, Edmund Gibson (who published his edition of the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> in 1692), and William Nicolson, thinking of an expanded second edition of the <span class="italic">Institutiones</span>. He also contributed to the nonjurors' defence of the deprived bishops. Among other tracts he countered William Sherlock's influential ideas about divine providence (<span class="italic">The Case of Allegiance due to Sovereign Princes</span>, 1691), which propagated acceptance of and loyalty to William III by the providential right of a non-hereditary king, in his anonymous <span class="italic">Vindication of Some among Ourselves Against the False Principles of Dr. Sherlock</span> (1692), a legitimist defence of hereditary monarchy. In May 1693 Sancroft, wishing to continue the apostolic succession among nonjurors, sent Hickes to James II at St Germain to obtain permission to appoint suffragans in line with Henrician statute. Delayed by illness Hickes finally returned to London on 4 February 1694. He was secretly consecrated suffragan bishop of Thetford on 24 February 1694 by the deprived bishops William Lloyd of Norwich, Francis Turner of Ely, and Thomas White of Peterborough. (A second nonjuror, Thomas Wagstaffe, was consecrated suffragan bishop of Ipswich.) When Gilbert Burnet attacked the deprived bishops in his funeral sermon on Archbishop Tillotson, Hickes published <span class="italic">Some Discourses upon Dr. Burnet and Dr. Tillotson</span> (1695), once more anonymously. Hickes's depreciation of his adversary Tillotson gave great offence.<br>
<br>During the years of his persecution Hickes lived in insecure and impoverished circumstances. He suffered from ill health and was frustrated by a lack of progress in his scholarship, being forced to move about the country to hide from the authorities. Friends such as Charlett supplied him with books. Hickes stayed at Bagshot with the Jacobite Colonel Grymes (James Grahme or Graham) and worked on an answer to Burnet's <span class="italic">Reflections on &hellip; &#145;Some Discourses&#146;</span> (1696), with which Burnet had continued his argument against the deprived bishops, until in February the assassination plot broke out and he was forced to leave Bagshot (Grahme was arrested 3 March). Hickes stayed in various places, notably at Shottesbrooke with the Jacobite Francis Cherry for three months in the summer of 1696. A later friend, the nonjuror antiquary Thomas Hearne, remembered:<blockquote>the house was one night (about twelve a Clock I think) beset, on purpose to apprehend him, but he got out at a back door, passed through the Gardens into the Church Yard &amp; escaped safe to Bagshot to Collonel Grymes's, &amp; his wife followed. (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 10.237)</blockquote>Subsequently Hickes stayed at Ambrosden with White Kennett, then vicar of Ambrosden and rector of Shottesbrooke, for five weeks in June&#150;July 1696. He lived in a house at Sandford and after a period of illness and fever moved to Gloucester Green, Oxford, where he composed his <span class="italic">Declaration &hellip; Concerning the Faith and Religion in which he Lived and Intended to Die</span> (published posthumously, 1743). In 1697 he went to live with the Jacobite antiquary William Brome at Ewithington in Herefordshire, where he stayed for more than a year. In 1698 Hickes was back in London and living in Ormond Street, where he would remain for the rest of his life. It was this troublesome decade in Hickes's life which saw the production of his most important and influential work of scholarship, the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> (1703&#150;5). In May 1699 Chancellor John Somers obtained an act of council for Hickes by which the attorney-general was ordered to cause a writ of <i>nolle prosequi</i>, to be entered to cease all proceedings against him.<h2>
<a name="Linguarumveterumseptentrionaliumthesaurusgrammaticocriticusetarchaeologicus"></a>Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archaeologicus</h2>&#145;If the work of Junius had been in part the mainspring of this [Anglo-Saxon] movement, its leader was to be Hickes, and the enthusiastic scholars who were to surround him all wore in some measure the livery of his majestic mind&#146;  (Douglas, 65). In the 1690s Hickes's <span class="italic">Institutiones</span> gradually grew from a grammar (it had already included Run&oacute;lfur J&oacute;nsson's Old Icelandic grammar and Edward Bernard's &#145;Etymologicon Britannicum&#146;), via an idea about a second edition with additional studies, to a full-blown history of the English language and a monumental work of Old English and medieval Germanic culture and history, archaeology, numismatics, philology, and bibliography, for which he enlisted the scholarly assistance and expertise of a range of English, Swedish, and Danish scholars. It was to be called <span class="italic">Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archaeologicus</span>.<br>
<br>Continuing with his philological and linguistic studies of Old English, Gothic, Dutch, Francic, and later Old Icelandic, Hickes ever widened his scope and developed insights into the interrelated northern languages. This interest from his Oxford days became a passion now that he was in his fifties. &#145;For as I take it&#146;, he explained to Charlett in 1694,<blockquote>there are four old origenall European languages the Greek, the Sclavonick, the Gothick, and the Celtick, or ancient Brittish, and he that understands them all, as an ingenious Welshman that hath learned Greek, may easily do, will be able to illustrat the Harmony of Languages ancient, and modern, Latin also comprehended, because it is little els, but Greek. He will also thereby be enabled to illustrat many things in antiquity, which yet ly in darknesse, and the discoverys he will find himself able to make in these thinges will be so delightfull to him, that he will scarse be sensible of his paines. (Harris, <span class="italic">Chorus of Grammars</span>, 151)</blockquote>Together at Ambrosden in 1696, Hickes worked with White Kennett, who had been pursuing his own antiquarian studies for his <span class="italic">Parochial Antiquities</span> (1695), on an &#145;Etymologicon Anglicanum&#146;. Correspondences with Nicolson, Gibson, Hopkins, and Thomas Smith continued and through Charlett, Hickes was introduced to Humfrey Wanley, then an assistant at the Bodleian and later Harley's librarian and a leading Saxonist and palaeographer. In fact, Wanley was to become more of a co-author, with contributions throughout the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> and fully responsible for the <span class="italic">Catalogue</span> of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts which eventually appeared as volume 2.<br>
<br>Many others became involved. The connoisseur Sir Andrew Fountaine (assisted by Ralph Thoresby) contributed an essay on Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Danish coins and William Elstob his edition of the <span class="italic">Sermo Lupi</span>. The Scandinavian Christian Worm offered assistance when at Oxford in 1696&#150;7, and though he left England rather abruptly he remained an important influence on Hickes's pursuit of runic materials. Contacts with Danish and Swedish scholars, among them Jonas Nicolaus Salan, Petrus N. Salan, and Johann Peringsk&ouml;old the elder, who sent a catalogue of manuscripts in the Antikvitetsarkiv, Uppsala, were established mostly through the correspondence of Edward Thwaites. Thwaites, professor of Greek and an inspiring teacher of Old English at Queen's College, Oxford, was responsible for much of the proof-reading, the production of the book at Oxford University Press, the finances (the project was published by subscription), and the distribution of the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>.<br>
<br>Hickes improved J&oacute;nsson's Old Icelandic grammar for the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> and expanded his Anglo-Saxon grammar with six new chapters, which:<blockquote>deserve a full-length study in themselves, constituting as they do the first history of the English language and a remarkably early survey of Old English literature and poetics. Hickes's sensitivity ranged far beyond the merely linguistic, and his understanding of early Germanic poetry was extraordinary for the time. (Harris, <span class="italic">Chorus of Grammars</span>, 79)</blockquote>In 1699 Hickes began his &#145;Dissertatio epistolaris&#146; (for vol. 1), a remarkable study to which other Saxonists also contributed and in which Hickes argued the use of philology for the understanding of pre-conquest history, the Saxon laws, and the institutions of the country. Its discourse on the charters and the methodology needed to ascertain their authenticity (Wanley's contributions were crucial here) inaugurated the study of diplomatic for England (as Mabillon had done for France). Thus the work of Hickes and his co-workers in the field provided a &#145;chorus of grammars&#146;, a corpus of historical linguistics and comparative philology as well as the sources of history and the critical apparatus needed for historical and literary scholarship to make a great leap forward. It would take about a century, however, before scholarship would again attain Hickes's erudition and technical level.<h2>
<a name="BonuspastoroftheremnantoftheChurchofEngland17001715"></a>&#145;Bonus pastor&#146; of the remnant of the Church of England, 1700&#150;1715</h2>After the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span> was finally published, and after the preparation of the <span class="italic">Conspectus brevis</span> (1708) nominally by William Wotton, but mostly executed by Hickes himself in order to boost the sales of the <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, Hickes's studies in Saxon and medieval Germanic philology were exhausted and he consciously stopped his efforts. During the reign of Queen Anne he continued as a patristic scholar, a nonjuror controversialist (with regular contributions to the renewed political debate on the succession question after he obtained the <i>nolle prosequi</i>), and a &#145;bonus pastor&#146; to the nonjuring community which now faced an additional oath of abjuration of the hereditary Stuart, James, the Pretender. He offered important moral support to, among others, the antiquary Thomas Hearne. Especially after the death of William Lloyd, deprived bishop of Norwich, when Henry Dodwell and the Shottesbrooke nonjurors returned to the established church in 1710 Hickes was intent on leading, as bishop, pastor, and theologian, what he considered was the surviving remnant of the true apostolic church.<br>
<br>Hickes's theology, like Dodwell's, based itself on Cyprianic principles and sacerdotal power. Yet where Dodwell's ultimate concern was with the church as a society receiving sacramental grace through apostolic succession and independent of secular power, John Kettlewell and Hickes insisted on a vision of the apostolic church which excluded not only Roman Catholics and presbyterians but also the great majority of Anglicans who no longer adhered to its doctrines of divine hereditary monarchy, passive obedience, and non-resistance. In this confessional and sectarian model (though it adopted Dodwellian principles), the consecration of new nonjuror bishops, and therefore separation, continued to be justified. Hickes published his views in such works as <span class="italic">Two treatises: one of the Christian priesthood, the other of the dignity of the episcopal order</span> (1707, an answer to the deist Matthew Tindal's <span class="italic">Rights of the Christian Church</span>, 1706), and <span class="italic">The Constitution of the Catholic Church and the Nature and Consequences of Schism</span> (published posthumously by Nathaniel Spinckes, 1716). After Wagstaffe's death Hickes was the only nonjuror bishop left, and it became necessary to consecrate new bishops to ensure the succession and the continuity of the surviving remnant of the Anglican church. Three new bishops, Samuel Hawes, Nathaniel Spinckes, and Jeremy Collier, were consecrated by Hickes and two Scottish bishops, James Gadderar and Archibald Campbell, at St Andrew's, Holborn, on Ascension day 1713. After Hickes's death his <span class="italic">Constitution</span> provoked attacks on the nonjurors from White Kennett (<span class="italic">A Second Letter to the Lord Bishop of Carlisle</span>, 1716), Benjamin Hoadly, and Nathaniel Marshall in the wider context of the Bangorian controversy.<br>
<br>Hickes's life was plagued with spells of severe illness. In addition, his wife, Frances, in the early 1700s suffered from a long debilitating disease. She died on 3 December 1714. Hickes died of stone on 15 December 1715 at Westminster. He was buried in St Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, on 18 December. He bequeathed his manuscripts and letters to the nonjuror Hilkiah Bedford, his closest friend since the death of Kettlewell. A sale catalogue of his books was published in 1716. According to Hearne, Hickes desired Bedford to write his biography, which Bedford started but left unfinished. A number of Hickes's works were published after his death, among them Francis Lee's <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Kettlewell</span> (1718) with an introduction by Hickes and based on materials and reminiscences of Robert Nelson and Hickes.<br>
<br>The emphasis in studies about Hickes from the days of his biographer Bedford to late twentieth-century scholarship has clearly shifted from a preoccupation with the churchman and nonjuror to one with the Anglo-Saxon scholar. No doubt posterity owes most to Hickes's achievements as a Saxon scholar, even more so because the discipline declined and much of the early Saxonists' expertise was lost for most of the remaining part of the eighteenth century. Hickes's <span class="italic">Thesaurus</span>, as R. L. Harris proves, remains a landmark of scholarship today. But as David Douglas has observed, the importance of Hickes needs to be recognized as combining in one remarkable man religious and theological thought on the one hand, and often (but not exclusively) religiously motivated and high-principled antiquarian scholarship on the other. This combination was characteristic not only of Hickes as a leading philologist but of many contemporary antiquarian scholars of the Augustan age, although few equalled the versatility and depth of Hickes's learning.<br>
