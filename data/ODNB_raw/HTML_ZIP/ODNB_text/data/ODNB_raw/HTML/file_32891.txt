<span class="headword">Dreschfeld,  Julius</span>  (1845&#150;1907), <span class="occ">pathologist and physician</span>, was born on 13 October 1845 at Niederw&auml;ren, near Bamberg, Bavaria, the youngest son in a family of five sons and five daughters of Samuel Dreschfeld, a well-to-do merchant, and his wife, Giedel. His parents were well-respected Orthodox Jews; his father lived until the age of ninety-two, and his mother to ninety-seven. In 1861, after completing his early education at the Bamberg Gymnasium, he came to Britain to live with his brother Leopold Dreschfeld (1824&#150;1897), a dentist in Manchester. Julius entered Owens College (the forerunner of Manchester University), and gained prizes in English, mathematics, and science, including the Dalton chemical prize (1863) and the Dalton junior mathematical scholarship (1864). He attended the Manchester Royal School of Medicine in Pine Street, but in 1864 he returned to Bavaria to continue his medical study at the University of W&uuml;rzburg. In 1866 his studies were interrupted by the &#145;seven week&#146; Austro-Prussian War, during which he acted as assistant surgeon in the Bavarian army. On his return to W&uuml;rzburg he graduated MD in 1867 with a thesis &#145;Reflex action of the vagus nerve on blood pressure&#146;. He acted as assistant to Albert von Bezold (1838&#150;1868), professor of physiology, and made a special study of pathology, the area of medicine in which he was to specialize. In 1869 he returned to Britain, and after becoming licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London, he set up in practice in Manchester. In 1872 he was appointed honorary physician to the Hulme Dispensary, Manchester, and the following year honorary assistant physician at the Manchester Royal Infirmary; in 1883, on the resignation of Sir William Roberts, he was made a full honorary physician, and in due course senior honorary physician in 1899, and the first honorary consulting physician in 1905.<br>
<br>Dreschfeld's most important contributions were to the study of pathology, especially related to diseases of the nervous system. In 1875 he was asked to supervise and catalogue the pathological collection in the Owens College medical museum, and the following year he was promoted to lecturer in pathology. Under his influence the pathology department rapidly expanded and played an increasingly important role in the medical school. In 1881 he was appointed as professor of general pathology, morbid anatomy, and morbid histology, the first chairs in these subjects in England. Dreschfeld's knowledge of the French and German medical literature was encyclopaedic, and he travelled widely throughout Europe visiting medical laboratories to learn new techniques. His pathology laboratory at Owens College, one of the first of its kind in Britain, was modelled on those in the continental medical schools. He stressed the importance of pathology in medical training, and argued that a good knowledge of pathology was essential to the practice of clinical medicine. He was said to be an extremely good teacher both at the bedside and in the lecture theatre; the number of his students rose from 3 in 1873 to 110 in 1891. He urged his students to look beyond the superficial manifestations of disease, and to try to explain their patients' symptoms in terms of the underlying pathology. It was mainly due to Dreschfeld's influence that pathology became established as an essential part of the medical curriculum in Britain. His most enduring research contribution to pathology was his paper &#145;A new staining fluid&#146; in the <span class="italic">Journal of Anatomy and Physiology</span> (1876), which described the use of eosin dye to stain tissue slides to reveal microscopic detail&#151;this became a standard technique, still in present use. His work on rabies during the 1882&#150;3 epidemic in Manchester is also well known&#151;he attempted to develop an attenuated anti-rabies vaccine by injecting infected spinal tissue into rabbits. His technique was similar to that used by Louis Pasteur for anthrax in 1881 (Pasteur's own anti-rabies vaccine was not available until 1888). Dreschfeld's work on rabies may have succeeded, but it was never completed because of the <span class="roman">Cruelty to Animals Act</span> (1876). He explained in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> (14 August 1886) that the experiments had to be carried out immediately after the death of a rabies victim, and there was never sufficient time to apply for the necessary animal licence. He thought the act was too restrictive, and was holding back medical research in Britain.<br>
<br>In 1891 Dreschfeld gave up his chair in pathology to take over the chair of medicine from John Edward Morgan&#151;a unique achievement, and a tribute to his breadth of medical knowledge. Dreschfeld was one of the best-known physicians in England, his opinion was greatly respected, and he was widely consulted, especially for neurological problems. Apart from his work at the Royal Infirmary he held honorary posts at the Manchester Skin Hospital, the Manchester Jewish Hospital, and the Christie Cancer Hospital. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1875 and a fellow in 1883; he delivered the Bradshawe lecture on &#145;diabetic coma&#146; in 1887. He was married twice: first in 1888 to Selina (<i>d</i>. 1904), daughter of Felix Gaspari of Berlin, with whom he had two sons and two daughters; and again in 1905, to Ethel, daughter of Dr James Harvey Lilley of Leamington Spa, who survived him.<br>
<br>Dreschfeld took a prominent part in many local medical, scientific, and philanthropic societies. He helped to form the Pathological Society of Manchester (1885), and was a founder member of the Pathological Society of Great Britain (1906); he was president of the Manchester Medical Society in 1888, and president of the Manchester Therapeutics Society in 1899. He took an active part in the British Medical Association, acting as president of the pathological section in 1886, and president of the section of medicine in 1902. He was a strong supporter of the Manchester Society for Aiding Distressed Foreigners, and was medical adviser to the Manchester Royal School of Music.<br>
<br>A slowly progressive disease of the spinal cord from which he suffered since 1897 (said by some of his colleagues to be a form of multiple sclerosis) impaired his walking, but scarcely affected his varied industry. While preparing his forthcoming Lumleian lecture to the Royal College of Physicians, he died suddenly at his home, Stanley House, Wilmslow Road, Withington, Manchester, from heart failure on 13 June 1907. He had previously converted to Christianity, and following a Church of England service, attended by a large congregation of friends and colleagues from Manchester, he was buried in a family vault in Holy Trinity churchyard, Hoghton Street, Southport, on 18 June. He was remembered by a memorial scholarship, founded by his wife and colleagues, for new medical students.<br>
<br>Dreschfeld wrote over 120 papers in English, French, and German; a full bibliography can be found in the <span class="italic">Dreschfeld Memorial Volume</span> compiled by Professor E. M. Brockbank in 1908. Dreschfeld's published works covered all aspects of general medicine; he made important observations on the metabolic effects of diabetes, and the classification of Hodgkin's disease; he wrote the sections on peptic ulceration, endocarditis, and typhoid for Clifford Allbutt's textbook <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (1896&#150;8). He was an authority on diseases of the nervous system and his most important contributions were in this area; he described the pathology of motor neurone disease, alcoholic paralysis, neurosyphilis, and numerous other rare neurological disorders. His work in clinical medicine and neurology is well known; he can be regarded as one of the founders of neuropathology, and many of his observations can still be traced in modern-day medical practice. However, it is arguable that his contribution to British medical education was even more important than his clinical and laboratory work; his introduction of pathology into the medical curriculum signalled a new approach to the understanding of disease, and raised the standard of medical teaching. In this respect Dreschfeld should be remembered not only as a great teacher, but also as one of the founders of modern scientific medicine.<br>
