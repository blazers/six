<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacDonnell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Manners; <em>other married name </em>Villiers]</span>,  Katherine</span>, duchess of Buckingham and marchioness of Antrim  (1603?&#150;1649), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17953/', "Francis Manners, sixth earl of Rutland (1578&#150;1632)")</script>, the leading noble of the midlands and a prominent courtier, and his wife, Frances Knyvet (<i>d</i>. 1605), the daughter and heir of a rich Wiltshire gentleman. Her mother died shortly after she was born and her father then remarried and had two sons, who both died young. Thus Katherine was sole heir both to her mother's fortune and to extensive, unentailed portions of the Manners estates in Northamptonshire and Yorkshire, together with estates in Buckinghamshire and Leicestershire and the barony of Ros. Her wealth and good looks made her particularly attractive to James VI and I's young favourite <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, marquess (and later first duke) of Buckingham (1592&#150;1628)")</script>, and the young couple fell passionately in love. On 16 May 1620, at the tender age of seventeen, Katherine married Buckingham (having first renounced her Catholicism) and over the course of the next nine years they had five children, of whom three survived infancy: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28294/', "George Villiers, later second duke of Buckingham (1628&#150;1687)")</script>, Lord Francis Villiers (1629&#150;1648), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56054/', "Lady Mary Villiers (1622&#150;1685)")</script>. Katherine and her children quickly became great favourites of the king. Following Buckingham's assassination in 1628 she inherited, together with her sons, an enormous fortune, which included Buckingham's London mansions&#151;Wallingford House, Walsingham House, and York House&#151;together with nineteen more modest properties on the Strand and a mansion in Chelsea; in addition she received an annual income of roughly &pound;4550 from the Irish customs and a state pension of &pound;6000. She reverted to Catholicism and remained a devout Catholic for the rest of her life; she later noted that she &#145;would pour out my life in defence of [Catholicism] &hellip; nothing can frighten me from my faith&#146;  (O'Ferrall and O'Connell, 2.757). An intimate of the papal agent George Con (who addressed her as &#145;fond Kate&#146;), she was instrumental in converting &#145;women of quality&#146; (including Endymion Porter's wife and Lady Newport) to Catholicism.<br>
<br>Next to Henrietta Maria the duchess of Buckingham, as one of Charles I's favourites, was probably the most important and influential woman at the Caroline court and, together with her daughter Mary, her sister-in-law Susan Feilding, Lady Denbigh, and the Catholic countess of Roxburghe, she held a position of honour in the queen's household. Thanks to her Villiers connections she was related to the earls of Desmond, Arundel, Suffolk, Northampton, Nithsdale, Pembroke, and Hamilton (who replaced her husband as the royal favourite). Loyalty to the late duke's memory also brought the support of numerous old Buckingham clients, including Endymion Porter, Sir Robert Pye, Sir Edward Conway, and Secretary Windebank. The second marriage of Katherine's daughter Lady Mary to James Stewart [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26707/', "Stuart, James")</script>], fourth duke of Lennox (and, after 1641, of Richmond), in the summer of 1637, secured the patronage of Charles's closest blood relative and one of his most intimate friends. However, Katherine's most important and influential patron was William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
<br>With Buckingham's death Katherine had become the most eligible widow at court, and in April 1635 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17462/', "Randal MacDonnell, Lord Dunluce (1609&#150;1683)")</script>, heir to the first earl of Antrim. The duchess was forced to pay a high price for marrying a Catholic from Ireland several years her junior. Every measure was taken to ensure that Dunluce, who was obviously regarded by many at court as something of a gold digger, should have no jurisdiction over her children's inheritance. In addition her contemporaries snubbed her. According to Laud her friends were all &#145;ill-satisfied with her marriage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 7.137), which had lost her much ground &#145;with the king himself as well as all others of quality&#146;  (ibid., 135). However, within a relatively short period of time the court, led by the king, became reconciled to the match and the duchess was restored to her former position of favour. She continued to use her former title.<br>
<br>During the early years of their marriage (during which time Katherine miscarried at least twice) the couple lived at York House, but in an effort to cut down on expenditure they moved to Ireland in 1638 and made Dunluce Castle their primary residence. The outbreak of the Irish rising in October 1641 disrupted their peaceful existence and the duchess immediately left Ireland and joined Charles I's court in York. During the 1640s she divided her time between the royalist court in England, Ireland, and Flanders and she repeatedly importuned the king and other leading figures, such as the dukes of Hamilton and Ormond, on her husband's behalf, and in 1645 helped to secure him his marquessate. From October 1647 she remained in Ireland, administering her husband's privateering business and involving herself in confederate politics, including Antrim's abortive rising against Ormond in October 1648. In August 1649 she received permission to join her son and the exiled royal court in France but lack of funds forced her to remain in Waterford. Her health took a dramatic turn for the worse in late October. Shortly afterwards, in November 1649, she died, perhaps from the plague that was raging through Ireland, and was buried outside the walls of Waterford. A monument was erected in Westminster Abbey. Her extensive English estates and properties all passed to her son George, second duke of Buckingham.<br>
<br>Of Katherine's personality little is known though Clarendon described her as a woman of &#145;very great wit and spirit&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 3.509). An examination of her household accounts between 1629 and 1634, which she carefully annotated in her rather childish hand, suggests that she was pampered and extravagant yet fastidious, resilient and an extremely shrewd businesswoman. Extant letters confirm this and illustrate her loyalty and devotion to&#151;and her passion for&#151;her husbands. In Antrim's case she was his closest confidante and adviser, acting as his deputy, secretary, and watchdog.<br>
