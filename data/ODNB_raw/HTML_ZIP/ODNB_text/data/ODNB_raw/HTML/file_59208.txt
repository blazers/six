<span class="headword">Miles <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Guest]</span>,  Jane Mary <span class="st"> [Jenny]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1762&#150;1846), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born about 1762, probably in Bath: her father, Thomas Guest (<i>fl</i>. 1760&#150;1800), was a tailor there. Nothing more is known of her parents other than that her father played a role in Bath's musical community by renting rooms to musicians as well as occasionally selling musical compositions and tickets to concerts. Jenny's musical instructors in Bath included Thomas Orpin, her first teacher, and Thomas Linley. By her seventh birthday she had made such remarkable progress with her keyboard studies under Orpin that &#145;A Lady&#146; felt compelled to publish a poetic tribute that concluded with the prescient observation:<blockquote>
<div>With envy, Orpin, you may view<br>
</div>
<div>Your pupil&#151;she'll tutor you.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, 12 May 1768, 3)</blockquote>Her subsequent teachers included Johann Christian Bach, Antonio Sacchini, and Venanzio Rauzzini. Beginning in the late 1770s her frequent performances in London, Bath, and the west country resulted in glowing critical assessments of her skill and musicianship: one enthusiastic admirer hailed her as the &#145;British Caecilia&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath Chronicle</span>, 10 May 1781, 2). Fanny Burney, who heard her in Bath, praised Miles as the best performer she had heard since leaving London and described her as &#145;very young [18], but far from handsome; she is, however, obliging, humble, unassuming, and pleasing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary and Letters</span>, 1.358&#150;9). Members of the royal family and professional classes, as well as musicians, were among the nearly 500 subscribers to her first publication, <span class="italic">Six sonatas for the harpsichord or piano forte, with an accompaniment for a violin or German flute</span>, op. 1 (1783). The sonatas were subsequently published in Paris (1784) and Berlin (1785). Her marriage on 29 August 1789 (St George, Hanover Square) to Abraham Allen Miles (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;1832), an accountant with London Assurance House, did not impede her musical activities. In 1804 she was appointed instructor to Princess Amelia and, in 1806, to Princess Charlotte; Miles retained the latter position until the prince regent's dismissal of the princess's staff in 1814. She published a sonata for piano and violin in 1809; beginning in 1820 and continuing for about ten more years, she published at least fifteen additional compositions.<br>
<br>Abraham Miles died in 1832, and near the close of her own life Miles moved to Blackheath to live with her daughter, Louisa, and son-in-law, John Lawrence. Their child, Louisa Cecilia Lawrence, is the likely dedicatee of Miles's last work, <span class="italic">The Field Daisy</span>. Following a &#145;long and tedious malady&#146; (according to one obituary) Miles died at 8 Eliot Place, Blackheath, on 20 March 1846 and was interred a week later beside her husband in a chancel vault in the church of St Edmund, King and Martyr, Lombard Street, London.<br>
<br>Technically quite difficult, Jane Miles's works reflect the prevailing musical tastes of their times. The op. 1 sonatas embrace the <i>galant</i> style popular during the late eighteenth century, while her works from the 1820s&#151;with such titles as &#145;La Georgiana&#146;, &#145;La Jeanette&#146;, and &#145;La jolie Julienne&#146;&#151;suggest the milieu of the Romantic salon. Whether early or late, Miles's compositions conform to period expectations in that they entertain and charm more than they ennoble and challenge.<br>
