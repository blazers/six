<span class="headword">Ortiz,  Elisabeth  Lambert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Elisabeth Lambert]</span>  (1915&#150;2003), <span class="occ">writer on cookery and poet</span>, was born on 17 June 1915 in Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, the second of three daughters of a marine salvage engineer who moved his family to Jamaica when she was eight years old. She was at school for some time there, and in an introduction to <span class="italic">The Book of Latin American Cooking</span> (1969) she wrote that it was in Jamaica that she became interested in this subject. Her father moved his business to Australia, and there Elisabeth got a job on a Sydney newspaper as a court reporter, soon adding the theatre and film critics' columns to her portfolio. She also published three volumes of poetry.<br>
<br>Elisabeth Lambert's first marriage was to (Robert) Patrick Terpening, an Australian artist who became a pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force and was killed on active service while based in Britain in April 1945. She returned to London in 1949, and worked as a journalist for some years, writing a verse drama broadcast by the BBC and publishing, as Elisabeth Lambert, a thriller, <span class="italic">The Sleeping House Party</span> (1951), followed in 1954 by a novelized account of her family's time in the West Indies, <span class="italic">Father Couldn't Juggle</span>. She had by then moved to New York, where she had accepted a job as a writer for the fledgeling United Nations, and had met and married C&eacute;sar Ortiz Tinoco (1915/16&#150;1991), a Mexican diplomat from a distinguished military family, then posted to the UN. An elegant, urbane, civilized man who shared his new wife's love of English literature, poetry, good food, and plentiful drink, Ortiz started her on a career as a food and cookery writer. &#145;When I first married and we were still in New York,&#146; she wrote in 1998, &#145;C&eacute;sar told me about Mexico's extraordinary contribution to the world's cultivated food.&#146; She then gave a list of foodstuffs of Central American origin: &#145;chocolate, vanilla, corn (maize), chillies (sweet, pungent and hot), tomatoes, avocados, green beans, the dried beans like kidney beans, pumpkin and the summer squash &hellip; papayas (pawpaws), turkeys and others&#146;  (<span class="italic">The New Complete Book of Mexican Cooking</span>, 1998, 7). She had a scholarly turn of mind that permeated even her popular journalism, and the lure of this list was irresistible&#151;for she now realized that the food of the contemporary world from India to Italy depended on these New World ingredients.<br>
<br>When her husband was transferred to the UN Information Centre in Mexico, Elisabeth's command of Spanish became &#145;rapid, fluent and grammatically a terror&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mexican Cooking</span>, 8). The stallholders of the markets where she bought her food taught her the basics of Mexican cooking, and her mother-in-law taught her food customs. As the couple travelled in Mexico, she learned that, though Mexican cooks were relaxed about quantities (which made collecting recipes difficult), the cuisine itself was strongly regional and almost as diversified as French regional cooking. Like France, Mexico has <i>haute cuisine</i>, and from reading history by Spanish writers, she discovered &#145;descriptions of the markets, the kitchen, the banquet hall, the food of the ordinary people, of soldiers, nobles and the Emperor himself&#146;  (ibid., 9). Her husband directed her reading so that she learned what was known about the pre-Columbian diet, and she concluded that &#145;the Mexican kitchen of today rests very solidly on its Aztec and Mayan foundations&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Asked to contribute some Mexican recipes to <span class="italic">House and Garden</span> magazine, it occurred to Elisabeth that she could have a career as a professional cookery writer. She was taken up by the powerful James Beard, who encouraged her to write an entire book about Mexican cookery, and by Craig Claiborne, the other power-broker in the American food world, who wrote about her in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, with the result that she received a contract for her book before she had finished writing it. <span class="italic">The Complete Book of Mexican Cooking</span> (1967), published like all her subsequent work under the name Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz, won awards, and its author became a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Gourmet</span> magazine and consultant on the monumental Time&#150;Life <span class="roman">Foods of the World</span> series.<br>
<br>Elisabeth Ortiz and her husband used their UN holidays to travel widely in South America and the Caribbean, and in 1969 she published the first of several editions of <span class="italic">The Book of Latin American Cooking</span>, which established her as the undisputed English-language expert on the &#145;enormous cuisine that stretches from the Rio Bravo (Rio Grande) to the Antarctic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Book of Latin American Cooking</span>, 1984 edn, 11). In 1973 she published <span class="italic">The Complete Book of Caribbean Cooking</span>. In the mid-1970s the UN sent C&eacute;sar to the Middle East and Asia, and they made their home in Bangkok. Lizzie (as she was known to her friends) wrote for the English-language paper, while writing a book on Japanese food. On his retirement in 1980, they moved to a house in Ealing, where he helped her with her research on the impact of new archaeological findings on the history of agriculture in the Americas. She revised her books and wrote several more cookery titles, but suffered neglect by newspaper and magazine food editors, who seemed to have forgotten her eminence. They had had a child who had died many years earlier, and, crushed with grief after C&eacute;sar's death at the age of seventy-five in 1991, she moved to New York to be near her sister Joyce, who died herself shortly after the move. She remained in New York, and died there on 27 October 2003.<br>
