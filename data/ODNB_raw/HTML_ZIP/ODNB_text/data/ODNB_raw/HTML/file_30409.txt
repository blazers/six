</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anderson,  John</span>, first Viscount Waverley  (1882&#150;1958), <span class="occ">civil service administrator and politician</span>, was born at 1 Livingstone Place, Edinburgh, on 8 July 1882, the only surviving son of David Alexander Pearson Anderson (1855&#150;1948), a fancy stationer who later became a director of a well-known firm of printers and publishers, Valentine &amp; Sons of Dundee, and his wife, Janet Kilgour (1850&#150;1929), the daughter of Charles Wildgoose Briglmen and Catherine Beveridge. He was educated at George Watson's College for Boys and Edinburgh University, where he graduated BSc in 1903 with special distinction in mathematics, natural philosophy, and chemistry, and MA with first-class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy.<h2>
<a name="Earlycivilservicecareer"></a>Early civil service career</h2>Anderson intended to be a scientist, and spent a year at Leipzig University, where he made a special study of the chemical properties of uranium. However, he wished to marry his childhood sweetheart, Christina (Chrissie) Mackenzie (<i>d</i>. 1920), the daughter of Andrew Mackenzie, a commercial traveller, of Edinburgh, and his wife, Mary, and he was advised by his father that the civil service would offer a more certain and financially rewarding career. In 1905 he won the first place in the civil service examination and on 23 October entered the Colonial Office. At that date he spoke such broad Scots that colleagues had great difficulty in understanding him. He married Chrissie on 2 April 1907. They had one son, David Alastair Pearson (1911&#150;1990), who became a physician, and one daughter, Mary Mackenzie (<i>b</i>. 1916), who became director of the Women's Royal Army Corps in 1967.<br>
<br>At the Colonial Office Anderson served as secretary to committees on Nigerian lands (1908) and west African currency (1911&#150;12). In 1912 it seemed doubtful whether Lloyd George's national health-insurance scheme would be ready to start on the due date, and in February Anderson was one of a group of promising young civil servants who were hastily recruited to the National Health Insurance Commission, becoming its secretary in May 1913. He struck up a successful partnership with the commission's chairman, Sir Robert Morant, and his organizational ability marked him out for further advancement.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war in 1914 interrupted imports of medical supplies from Germany, and Anderson was asked to deal with the problem, which he did through the Medical Research Committee that had recently been set up in connection with the national health-insurance scheme. He successfully promoted collaboration between the principal British drug-manufacturing firms to discover the formulae for German patents, including aspirin. He was government representative on an advisory committee set up by the Royal Society to organize chemical research for wartime needs, and he impressed senior scientists with his grasp of scientific detail. Although he was of military age, he was urged not to volunteer since his work was of national importance. One day, as he crossed Whitehall, a young woman presented him with a white feather&#151;a badge of cowardice that hurt him to the quick. He registered his willingness to serve under the Derby scheme of October 1915 and was placed on the army reserve, but was never called up. The white feather incident rankled, however, and, according to his biographer, John Wheeler Bennett, may well have influenced his later career.<br>
<br>On 8 January 1917, when the German U-boat campaign was threatening Britain's food supplies, Anderson was appointed secretary to the new Ministry of Shipping under Sir Joseph Maclay, and he quickly won the confidence of the shipowners who served on the minister's advisory committee. In March 1919 he moved to the Local Government Board as an additional secretary, and when, four months later, the board and the Health Insurance Commission were merged in a new Ministry of Health, he became second secretary of the ministry. On 1 October of that same year he was appointed chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue. He quickly mastered the technical aspects of the board's work and in February 1920 was able to give a very impressive performance as a witness before a select committee of the House of Commons appointed to consider the controversial question of whether to levy a duty on wartime increases in wealth.<h2>
<a name="IrelandtheHomeOfficeandIndia"></a>Ireland, the Home Office, and India</h2>At this point in his career Anderson suffered a heavy blow: his wife died on 9 May 1920, aged thirty-three, during an operation for cancer. Her sister, Nellie Mackenzie, took charge of his children and household. Within a week of becoming a widower, Anderson was offered, and accepted, the post of joint under-secretary to Sir Hamar Greenwood, the new chief secretary for Ireland, at a time when &#145;the troubles&#146; were at their worst. As a member of the British cabinet, answerable in the House of Commons for the government's Irish policy, the chief secretary was normally in London, and relied greatly on the advice of the under-secretaries in Dublin. Anderson was also the Treasury's representative in Ireland, exercising control over government expenditure, and he was, in effect, the senior under-secretary. For security reasons Anderson and his colleagues in the Irish administration were advised to live within the cramped confines of Dublin Castle, where their offices were situated. He took up riding for exercise and, although he suffered frequent falls, he always remounted, undaunted. He was equally unperturbed in the face of the threat of assassination by the IRA. After the treaty that brought the troubles to an end, he established a good rapport with the IRA commander, Michael Collins, during discussions on how to hand over the administration to the provisional government of the Irish Free State.<br>
<br>Throughout his time in Ireland Anderson had continued to be nominally chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, and it was to that post that he returned in January 1922. However, two months later, aged forty, he was appointed permanent under-secretary at the Home Office, where he remained for ten years, serving no fewer than seven home secretaries in a period of political turmoil. In 1924&#150;5 he chaired a subcommittee of the committee of imperial defence on air-raid precautions, whose recommendations formed the basis of measures taken in 1939. A more pressing problem in 1925 was the threat of a general strike, and Anderson chaired the committee controlling preparations for the emergency that materialized in 1926. He attended the cabinet committee that met daily during the strike and on one occasion, when Winston Churchill advocated sending troops, armed with ball cartridges, to London docks to protect paper supplies for the government newspaper, the <span class="italic">British Gazette</span>, intervened with the words: &#145;I would beg the chancellor of the exchequer to stop talking nonsense&#146;  (Wheeler-Bennett, 106). Anderson's committee of officials maintained supply and transport efficiently while avoiding provoking violence by strikers.<br>
<br>In 1931 Anderson was asked to become governor of Bengal, a province of India troubled by terrorism directed at the British authorities. He told his son that he was willing to accept the risks because, unlike the majority of his contemporaries, he had not served in the war. Anderson twice narrowly escaped assassination during his period in office (1932&#150;7) and won admiration from opponents in the Indian National Congress Party as he continued to go about freely, unperturbed, among the Bengali population. He saw that their poverty was aggravated by regressive taxation and a catastrophic fall in the prices of rice and raw jute as a result of the world depression. Thus, although he gave notice of his intention to suppress terrorism by placing on a permanent basis existing anti-terrorist legislation and by extending the system of collective fines imposed on areas where terrorists had been sheltered and supported, he tackled successfully the problem of the distribution of revenue between the province and the central government of India, which was adjusted in the former's favour. He also arranged for people who had been detained as suspected terrorists to be trained in agriculture and manufacture before being released. Under Anderson's administration terrorism was all but suppressed, the province became financially solvent, and its economic and social problems were addressed: jute production was regulated through voluntary restriction; legislation was introduced for scaling down debts of farmers; and compulsory primary education was introduced. His normal five-year term of office was extended by six months to enable him to supervise the implementation of the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935, whereby self-government within provinces was granted from 1937.<h2>
<a name="Civildefenceandhomesecurity"></a>Civil defence and home security</h2>On his return to Britain Anderson was invited by the Scottish Unionist Party to be a candidate for the Scottish Universities seat, which had become vacant on the death of Ramsay MacDonald, and agreed, providing that he could stand as a National Government candidate without any party label. He won the election in February 1938, and remained an independent MP until university seats were abolished in 1950. In May he was appointed by the home secretary to chair a committee to inquire into the problems of evacuating civilians from cities in the event of war, and the committee's report in July became the basis for measures taken in the Second World War. Meanwhile, in September 1938, during the Munich crisis, he was appointed regional commissioner responsible for air-raid precautions in London and the home counties. On 31 October he joined the National Government as lord privy seal with responsibility for co-ordinating civil defence measures and for organizing a national register of people willing to serve voluntarily in the armed forces or for civil defence, including the police, the fire services, and nursing. Anderson saw the need for mass production of small domestic shelters that could protect families from bombing, and early in November he asked an old friend, William Paterson, an engineer, to design a model, from which was developed the Anderson shelter which was to be erected in millions of gardens during the war. Delivery of the shelters began in February 1939. From March to July Anderson piloted through the House of Commons the <span class="roman">Civil Defence Bill</span>, which gave considerably greater powers in peacetime to both government and local authorities.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war Anderson became home secretary and minister of home security, with responsibility for civil defence, evacuation arrangements, internment of aliens, and other measures required in war. Although he was not a member of the war cabinet, he attended its meetings regularly. When Churchill formed a coalition government on 10 May 1940 he asked Anderson to continue in office, notwithstanding the differences that the two men had had at the time of the general strike. Hitherto Anderson had resisted calls by Conservative back-benchers and in the press for mass internment of German and Austrian aliens, many of whom were refugees from Nazism, but, as the war situation deteriorated in May and June, he had to give way, and refugees previously classed by the Home Office as reliable, and women and children, were rounded up and sent to the Isle of Man or to Canada and Australia. The panic was fed by reports of fifth-column activities by Nazi sympathizers in Norway and the Netherlands, and Anderson felt obliged to order the detention of British subjects, notably members of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, who might be a danger in the event of invasion. Anderson commented in a letter to his father on 15 June: &#145;there is a whispering campaign going on which puts the witch-hunts of the Middle Ages completely in the shade. Everyone tends now to look askance at his neighbour&#151;very unfortunate, I think&#146;  (Wheeler-Bennett, 247).<br>
<br>When heavy bombing of London began in September 1940 Anderson was criticized by press and parliament because the government was not building deep shelters. He had agreed with a report in April 1939 that such shelters would require a great diversion of labour and materials from other defence preparations, and would create a &#145;shelter mentality&#146; that would interfere with war production, and he refused to give way. Churchill decided that someone with more experience of handling parliament was needed to deal with the criticism, and took advantage of Neville Chamberlain's resignation as lord president of the council in October 1940 to move Anderson to that office, and to replace him at the Home Office with Herbert Morrison.<h2>
<a name="Warcabinet"></a>War cabinet</h2>As lord president Anderson was a member of the war cabinet and chaired the lord president's committee, which co-ordinated the work of the war cabinet's other civil committees. Churchill told Anderson on 28 January 1941 that it was &#145;essential that the larger issues of economic policy should be dealt with by your committee and primarily by you&#146;  (Churchill, 102). Given the prime minister's preoccupation with strategic and military problems, Anderson found himself virtually in charge of what was coming to be known as the &#145;home front&#146;, handling and settling much of the business that the war cabinet would otherwise have had to manage. During 1941 the major issues before his committee included prices and wages, rationing, concentration of industry, and mobilization of manpower; during 1942 the committee extended its remit to food policy and social services. Anderson was often asked to arbitrate upon interdepartmental disputes or to advise the war cabinet on issues of policy that concerned several departments. He had the gift of anticipating problems. By informal talks with cabinet colleagues, whether or not they were members of his committee, he was able to bring questions to the committee in a form in which they could be discussed without acrimony and settled without delay. In particular, the allocation of manpower was the key to wartime planning. Such was Anderson's success in handling manpower issues that, when he left the office of lord president to become chancellor of the exchequer in 1943, responsibility was transferred from the lord president's committee to a new ministerial manpower committee under his chairmanship. Anderson also undertook secret work for which his scientific training equipped him, including negotiating with the Americans in summer 1943 on co-operation in the development of the atomic bomb, and he retained responsibility for atomic energy while chancellor of the exchequer.<br>
<br>Although held in the highest regard in Whitehall, Anderson was not at his best in the House of Commons. When he spoke for the government in a highly charged debate on 16 February 1943 on Sir William Beveridge's report, <span class="italic">Social Insurance and Allied Services</span>, he emphasized that his conclusions were provisional and subject to reconsideration, and he was frequently interrupted. It required a spirited speech three days later by Herbert Morrison to dispel the impression that the government had almost rejected the report. Within Whitehall, however, Anderson chaired a committee on reconstruction priorities which called for a report by officials and economists that would allow ministers to judge whether Beveridge's assumption that unemployment would be no worse on average after the war than the lowest level between the wars was justified. He had supported the employment of economists in the economic section of the war cabinet offices and, perhaps because he had attended lectures in economics at Edinburgh while preparing himself for the civil service examination, he seems to have been better able to cope with economic analysis than most ministers. On one occasion in March 1943 the section produced a particularly indigestible paper on post-war employment policy that led Keynes, then an adviser to the chancellor of the exchequer, to remark: &#145;I should like to offer a prize for any minister who reads it through without his attention wandering. Possibly John Anderson would win it, but there would be no <i>proxime accessit</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes</span>, 27.317). The economic section took a leading part in the inquiry, and the eventual outcome was the 1944 white paper on employment policy, in which the government accepted that one of its primary responsibilities after the war would be the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment.<h2>
<a name="Chancelloroftheexchequer"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer</h2>Meanwhile, Anderson had been appointed chancellor of the exchequer in September 1943, following the death of Sir Kingsley Wood. Wood had died on the day when he was to have introduced the <span class="roman">Wage Earners' Income Tax Bill</span>, which was to establish the PAYE (&#145;pay as you earn&#146;) system, and Anderson quickly mastered its complexities and piloted it through the House of Commons. His budget in 1944 foreshadowed the first major change in the Inland Revenue's way of handling depreciation of industrial assets: Anderson proposed that during the reconstruction period after the war ordinary provision for wear and tear should be rescheduled, with &#145;initial allowances&#146; of 20 per cent of expenditure on plant and machinery and 10 per cent on industrial buildings and mining works in any year to be written off at once against the profits of that year. As chancellor, Anderson had to deal with controversial questions relating to Anglo-American discussions on post-war commercial and monetary policy. Professor Lionel Robbins, the director of the economic section, noted on one occasion how the chancellor, with &#145;one puff of common sense&#146;, was able to provide a lead out of a diplomatic tangle arising from the need to keep both parliament and the US Congress informed about discussions on what was to become the International Monetary Fund  (Pressnell, 146). In January 1945 Churchill advised the king that, if he and the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, were to die at the same time before the end of the war, Anderson should be invited to form a coalition government. When the coalition broke up in May Anderson continued as chancellor in Churchill's caretaker government until Labour's election victory in July 1945.<h2>
<a name="Postwarappointmentsandpeerage"></a>Post-war appointments and peerage</h2>Although Anderson sat on the opposition front bench, he was appointed by Clement Attlee to chair the United Kingdom advisory committee on atomic energy in 1945, and he was very much involved in policy making for about a year; thereafter the disadvantage that he did not attend ministerial meetings led to the creation of a new standing committee, the atomic energy official committee. The importance of his committee waned, and it was wound up when he resigned in January 1948. When Churchill returned to power in 1951 he offered Anderson a peerage and the post of chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, with a view to his acting as &#145;overlord&#146; to the economic ministries: the Treasury, the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Supply. Anderson thought, however, that the proposed arrangement would conflict with the responsibilities to parliament of ministers in charge of these departments, and he declined the post. He did, however, accept a peerage in January 1952, entering the House of Lords as Viscount Waverley of Westdean in the county of Sussex. In 1952 his appointment as chairman of a royal commission on taxation of profits and incomes was announced, but, although he was well qualified by experience for the task, he was criticized by the Labour Party as someone who would not be sufficiently impartial, and he resigned. In 1953 he was asked by Churchill to chair the committee that recommended the establishment of the Atomic Energy Authority in the following year.<br>
<br>Anderson became chairman of the Port of London Authority in 1946, and he was a director of a number of companies, including the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Hudson's Bay Company, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), and Vickers Ltd. He was also a director of the Midland Bank in 1937&#150;8, but, whereas in 1945 he resumed other directorships that he had resigned when he became a minister in 1938, he felt that it was improper for a former chancellor of the exchequer to be associated with a bank. He succeeded Keynes as chairman of the Covent Garden Opera Trust in 1946.<h2>
<a name="Greatestadministratorofhisage"></a>Greatest administrator of his age</h2>Anderson's career as an official, pro-consul, and minister was probably unique in its range, certainly in the twentieth century. It was generally agreed in Whitehall that he was the greatest administrator of his age, perhaps of any age. He exemplified the qualities required of a civil servant: sound judgement, an ability to give objective advice, and a willingness to delegate. He had an exceptional memory and capacity for hard work, and his native shrewdness was reinforced over time by unrivalled experience. He preferred to give advice orally rather than in detailed memoranda, and consequently the full impact of his influence cannot be followed in official papers in the Public Record Office. His exceptional powers of concentration enabled him to limit his working day to 10.15 a.m. to 6.15 p.m., with an hour and a half off for lunch. As he once told a royal commission on the civil service: &#145;A man cannot work very long hours if he thinks really hard&#146;  (Wheeler-Bennett, 87). He never took official files away to work on at home, although he read a lot of blue books&#151;indeed, he was reputed to read nothing else. He was able to make himself the master of a subject quickly, and at meetings he would silently absorb information and listen to opinions before making summaries of the discussion that left room for only one possible decision. During the Second World War he took on vast responsibilities without creating a large new office of his own, preferring to work through existing agencies of government.<br>
<br>In the words of his biographer, Anderson was &#145;serenely possessed of the Roman virtue of <i>gravitas</i>, a natural moral power exuding from him in the shape of visible dignity and authority&#146;  (Wheeler-Bennett, 384). He never tried to get on friendly terms with subordinates. He did not entertain colleagues at home, and only rarely asked them to lunch at his club. As a minister he was exceptionally efficient, and he was heard with respect, but his aloofness prevented him from becoming a great parliamentarian. Although his serious manner could give the impression of pomposity, he had a pawky sense of humour and could relax with friends.<br>
<br>Anderson was brought up a Presbyterian, and he was ordained an elder in the Church of Scotland in St Andrew's Church, Calcutta, in 1933, and when in London he attended St Columba's, Pont Street; when he lived in Sutton (1912&#150;32), however, he attended the Congregational Church and, after his second marriage, he took communion in the Church of England (although he was never confirmed). He married, on 30 October 1941, Ava [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109615/', "Anderson, Ava Courtenay")</script>], the daughter of the writer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37203/', "John Edward Courtenay Bodley")</script>, and the widow of Ralph Follett Wigram, of the Foreign Office. He was elected FRS after his work on atomic research. Anderson was appointed CB (1918), KCB (1919), GCB (1923), GCIE (1932), and GCSI (1937), and was sworn of the privy council of Ireland (1920) and of the United Kingdom (1938). The Order of Merit was conferred on him during his last illness, a few weeks before his death, at St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 4 January 1958. He was buried in the churchyard of Westdean, Sussex.<br>
