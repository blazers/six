<span class="headword">Virtue,  James Sprent</span>  (1829&#150;1892), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 18 May 1829 at 26 Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row, London, the second of six children. His father, <a name="cosubject_28331"></a><span class="headword">George Virtue</span>  (1794&#150;1868), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born on 20 April 1794 in Polwarth, Berwickshire, the third son of Robert Virtue, cart-hirer, and his wife, Hellen McDougal. He married Helen Sprent on 25 May 1826, having established himself at Ivy Lane, London, in the &#145;numbers trade&#146;, selling extensive works in parts by subscription. His first major success was Alexander Fletcher's <span class="italic">Guide to Family Devotion</span> (1834) but it was as a publisher of illustrated books, employing the best artists and engravers, that he made his reputation. A series of steel-engraved topographical books, many illustrated by W. H. Bartlett, sold widely at home and abroad, notably William Beattie's <span class="italic">Switzerland</span> (2 vols., 1836). As the market for expensive &#145;view books&#146; declined during the 1840s, George Virtue turned his attention to art publishing. In 1848 he acquired the moribund <span class="italic">Art Union</span> and transformed it into the lavishly illustrated <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, which did much to promote the art of the engraver and raise standards of public taste. It was to prove one of the nineteenth century's most important art periodicals and has been an invaluable source of information for art historians of the period. At this time Virtue entered into partnership with Arthur Hall &amp; Co. and founded his own printing works at 294 City Road, London. The firm became self-sufficient in printing, engraving, and bookbinding, and provided such services for other publishers. He was active in the City of London as a deputy for Farringdon Within, a member of the court of the Stationers' Company and a director of the Great Central Gas Consumers' Company. An attack of paralysis in 1855 led to his retirement from business to Oatlands Park, Surrey. He died on 8 December 1868 of an apoplectic fit while dining at 7 Porchester Square, London, home of his son-in-law James Cotter Morison, and was buried at St Mary's, Walton-on-Thames, on 14 December 1868. His wife survived him.<br>
<br>At the age of fourteen James Virtue was apprenticed to his father and in 1848 was sent to the New York branch of the business. By 1851 he was head of a firm with offices across North America. Apart from a visit to London in 1850 to be admitted a liveryman of the Stationers' Company, he remained in the United States until 1855, when he returned to England to succeed his father. Under his proprietorship the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span> continued to prosper, distinguished by series of engravings of important collections such as the <span class="italic">Royal Gallery</span> (1855&#150;61) and the <span class="italic">Turner Gallery</span> (1860&#150;65), illustrated catalogues of international exhibitions, and monographs on contemporary artists. In 1862 the partnership with Hall was dissolved and Virtue established a second company with his elder brother George Henry at 1 Amen Corner, London. This closed after the latter's death in 1866 and the following year Virtue founded the monthly magazine <span class="italic">St Paul's</span> with Anthony Trollope as editor. However it failed to meet commercial expectations and in May 1869 was transferred to Strahan &amp; Co., where Virtue acted as printer and chief creditor. He eventually took control of the firm's management and in 1873, with Strahan's other creditors, formed the partnership Virtue, Spalding and Daldy. Two years later the firm became a limited company with Virtue as major shareholder and chairman of the board.<br>
<br>Following his father's example, Virtue continued to publish illustrated books of distinction, particularly editions of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Shakespeare, and topographical works. However, his commitment to expensive production standards led to periodic financial problems and a difficult legacy for his successors. Virtue married Jane Elizabeth Shirreff (<i>b</i>. 1841/2) on 20 November 1867; she eventually survived him. A keen sportsman, he became a founder member of the London Rowing Club in 1856, serving as treasurer and vice-president. For several years he donated the annual prize of a sculler's boat for novice rowers. He died of heart disease on 29 March 1892 at his London home, 3 Prince's Mansions, Victoria Street, and was buried on 2 April at St Mary's, Walton-on-Thames.<br>
