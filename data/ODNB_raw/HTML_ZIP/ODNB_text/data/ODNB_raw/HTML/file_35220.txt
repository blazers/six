<span class="headword">Newsholme, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1857&#150;1943), <span class="occ">public health official and epidemiologist</span>, was born on 10 February 1857 in Haworth, Yorkshire, the fourth son of Robert Newsholme (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1861), wool stapler or merchant, and his second wife, Phoebe, daughter of John Binns, wool comber, of Haworth. Robert Newsholme had been Patrick Bront&euml;'s churchwarden, but after Newsholme's death, when his son Arthur was four years old, Phoebe raised the children in a stricter Wesleyan environment. Newsholme attended a Wesleyan Sunday school and a free grammar school in Haworth before spending a year at Keighley grammar school. He aspired to a position in the Indian Civil Service, but in 1873 he was forced to withdraw from University College, London, because of family problems, probably financial. He returned to Bradford where his mother was then living. Only then did he consider medicine as a career, and he began a medical apprenticeship in Bradford. In the autumn of 1875 he returned to London and entered St Thomas's Hospital medical school, with the aid of a small inheritance he was permitted to take before his majority. He had a brilliant career as a medical student, winning prize money every year. He became a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1876, took his MB in 1880, and earned his MD and a gold medal in 1881. He held resident posts at St Thomas's, Tottenham Hospital, and at the Evelina Hospital for Children, London.<br>
<br>In 1881 Newsholme married Sara (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of William Mansford, farmer, of Marlborough, Lincolnshire; there were no children. Newsholme established a general practice on High Street, Clapham, in 1883, and supplemented his income by tutoring medical students and editing a series of science textbooks for schoolchildren. He first took an interest in public health in 1882, when he began lecturing on basic physiology and hygiene to teachers at elementary schools whose pupils would face questions on these subjects in the Department of Science and Art's examinations. Newsholme wrote his first books to exploit this market; <span class="italic">Hygiene: a Manual of Personal and Public Health</span> (1884), <span class="italic">School Hygiene: the Laws of Health in Relation to School Life</span> (1887), and <span class="italic">Lessons on Health: Containing the Elements of Physiology and their Application to Hygiene</span> (1890) all sold very well and went through several editions. In 1884 he became part-time medical officer of health for Clapham and earned his diploma in public health from London University the following year. He was not formally trained in vital statistics or epidemiology. He learned these subjects in his years at Clapham by studying the annual reports of William Farr and John Simon. Newsholme soon prepared a practical textbook on vital statistics. <span class="italic">The Elements of Vital Statistics</span> (1889) became a standard textbook for medical officers of health and was issued in a revised edition as late as 1923.<br>
<br>Newsholme made public health his sole occupation in May 1888, when he was appointed full-time medical officer of health for Brighton. During his twenty years in the town he built a model local authority public health programme&#151;first by more rigorously pursuing established preventive strategies in environmental sanitation and in inspection of meat and food; and then by expanding the work of the sanitary department into newer areas: the prevention of infant diarrhoea, housing reform, the notification of infectious diseases and case tracing, and a much expanded use of hospital isolation of infectious diseases. His best-known work in Brighton was probably the tuberculosis programme he helped to develop, which relied on voluntary notification of cases and municipally financed institutional treatment. Between 1905 and 1908 Newsholme published a series of studies on the epidemiology of tuberculosis, which culminated in his monograph, <span class="italic">The Prevention of Tuberculosis</span> (1908). In this work he attempted to show that institutional segregation of those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, most often in poor-law institutions, was the prime reason for the decline in tuberculosis mortality. While in Brighton, Newsholme also undertook important epidemiological studies of scarlet fever, diphtheria, epidemic diarrhoea, and rheumatic fever. His studies of the latter three diseases in the middle and late 1890s attempted to identify environmental factors which could account for the epidemic pattern of these diseases which, he was convinced, contagion alone could not explain. His investigation of scarlet fever not only helped to clarify the etiology of this puzzling disease, it also led to a highly effective municipal system of surveillance and response to milk-borne outbreaks of the illness.<br>
<br>In February 1908 Newsholme became the medical officer of the Local Government Board, a position he held until 1919. He was thus the central health authority's medical adviser during a period that saw important changes in the nation's health programmes: national health insurance was initiated and national programmes were established to combat tuberculosis, venereal disease, and infant mortality. Newsholme opposed important portions of Lloyd George's <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span>, fearing that they would compromise public health work in local authorities, particularly on tuberculosis. Between 1909 and 1913 he was the major force behind the orders from the Local Government Board that required the notification of tuberculosis cases and that encouraged local authorities to take steps to prevent the disease. Newsholme also played an important role in designing and implementing the venereal disease service that was hastily put in place following the final report of the royal commission on venereal disease in February 1916. His most important epidemiological studies at the Local Government Board were his five reports of infant, childhood, and maternal mortality, which appeared between 1910 and 1916 as supplements to his annual reports. These were the most comprehensive empirical studies of these subjects in English to date. By the time the final report appeared, the Local Government Board was locked in bitter competition with the Board of Education for the control of the nation's emerging programme to promote infant and child health. Newsholme resigned in March 1919 to avoid serving in the new Ministry of Health under his rival in this conflict, George Newman, chief medical officer of the Board of Education.<br>
<br>Newsholme had a very active retirement: he lectured on public health administration at the newly created School of Hygiene and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University between 1919 and 1921; he wrote and delivered public addresses on a variety of public health topics on both sides of the Atlantic; and he undertook for the Milbank Fund a major study of European health-care systems. His three-volume series, <span class="italic">International Studies on the Relation between the Private and Official Practice of Medicine</span> (1931), presented a detailed description of conditions in individual nations, whereas his <span class="italic">Medicine and the State: the Relation between the Private and Official Practice of Medicine</span> (1932) offered a synthesized discussion accessible to a more general reader. In August and September 1932, Newsholme visited the Soviet Union with John Kingsbury, secretary of the Milbank Fund. The result was their book, <span class="italic">Red Medicine: Socialized Health in Soviet Russia</span> (1933). In his remaining ten years of life Newsholme wrote a two-volume autobiographical history of public health, <span class="italic">Fifty Years in Public Health</span> (1935) and <span class="italic">The Last Thirty Years in Public Health</span> (1936). He was widowed in 1933 and then suffered a lengthy decline in his own health. He died on 17 May 1943 at his home, the White House, Durrington, Worthing, Sussex, at the age of eighty-six.<br>
<br>Newsholme was a prolific writer. His bibliography contains twenty-five book titles, several of which appeared in subsequent editions, over 160 articles and book chapters, some three dozen annual reports and supplemental reports, and numerous pamphlets. He was a leading figure in the public health world, serving as a council member of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, as president of the society (1900&#150;01), and twice as editor of its journal, <span class="italic">Public Health</span> (1892&#150;6 and 1906&#150;8). He was a regular examiner for the diploma of public health at London, Oxford, and Cambridge universities. He became a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1893, served as the college's Milroy lecturer in 1895, and became a fellow in 1898. In 1907 he was president of both the Royal Society of Medicine's section on epidemiology and the British Medical Association's section on state medicine. In 1912 he was made CB, and in 1917 advanced to KCB.<br>
