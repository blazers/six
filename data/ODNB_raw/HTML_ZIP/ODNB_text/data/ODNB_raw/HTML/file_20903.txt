<span class="headword">Osred I</span>  (696<span class="mult">x</span>8&#150;716), <span class="occ">king of Northumbria</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/306/', "Aldfrith")</script> whose only known wife was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6978/', "Cuthburh")</script>, sister of Ine, king of the West Saxons. An inconsistency in Bede's statements makes it uncertain whether Aldfrith died in 704 or 705, but the latter is the more likely. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> assigns Aldfrith's death to 14 December, after which (according to Stephen of Ripon's life of Bishop Wilfrid) an otherwise unknown king called Eadwulf reigned for two months. He was expelled following military operations around Bamburgh by a coalition involving Bishop Wilfrid, the princess&#150;abbess of Whitby, &AElig;lffl&aelig;d, and the ealdorman Beorhtfrith. Osred then became king at the age of eight, and also Wilfrid's adopted son. This relationship did not result in Wilfrid's restoration to the see of York, however; at a synod held on the banks of the River Nidd in the first year of Osred's reign, Wilfrid was allowed to retain the churches of Ripon and Hexham and was apparently made bishop of the latter. Warfare with the Picts was continued in Osred's reign, for in 711 the ealdorman (<i>praefectus</i>) Beorhtfrith defeated them between the rivers Avon and Carron in southern Scotland. Osred was killed in 716, but no reliable details of the killing are known, apart from a remark in the northern recension of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> that it took place &#145;south of the border&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 716, text D), possibly the border with the Picts. William of Malmesbury wrote of a conspiracy, but this was probably conjecture.<br>
<br>Writing while Osred was alive, Bede equated him with Josiah, the king of Judah responsible for purification of worship, but after the king's death he expressed the opinion that the standards of the church had declined since Aldfrith's time. Boniface, who shared this latter opinion, represented Osred as &#145;driven by the spirit of wantonness, fornicating, and in his frenzy debauching throughout the nunneries virgins consecrated to God&#146; (Tangl, no. 73; <span class="italic">English Historical Documents</span>, 1, no. 177), while the author of the ninth-century Latin poem <span class="italic">De abbatibus</span> accused him of killing his nobles or forcing them into monasteries. In the late eleventh century, Folcard associated him with a miracle worked by John of Beverley and described him as a man of religion and faith, but to the extent that this was based on any authentic tradition it may have been inspired by some otherwise unknown donation made by Osred to Beverley. It is possible that Osred's treatment of the church and his nobles derived from financial problems, for he failed to maintain Aldfrith's high quality silver coinage. His death ended the near monopoly of the Northumbrian kingship exercised by the descendants of &AElig;thelfrith (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.616) since the time of Oswald (<i>d</i>. 642), for Osred's successor was Cenred, son of Cuthwine, son of Leodwold, an alleged descendant of the founder of Bernicia, Ida, by a collateral line. No details are known of Cenred's reign, which lasted from 716 to 718.<br>
