<span class="headword">Petty <span class="st"> [Pettus]</span>,  Maximilian</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1617, <em>d.</em> in or after 1661?), <span class="occ">Leveller</span>, was probably the child of an Oxfordshire gentry family who was baptized on 3 June 1617 at Tetsworth. If so he was the second surviving son of John Petty (<i>d</i>. 1619&times;22) of Stoke Talmage, near Tetsworth, and his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1622), widow of Thomas Webley, clothier, of Witney in Oxfordshire, and daughter of one Johnson of Witney. He was apprenticed to London Grocers' Company in 1634 and gained his freedom in 1642. At an unknown date he married Mary, daughter of his uncle Leonard Petty; the couple had a single child, Mary, who married one Blackwell. The Pettys were connected by marriage to the Hampdens and the Ingoldsbys; one of Maximilian's uncles, another Maximilian, was MP for Westbury, Wiltshire, in 1628&#150;9. The MP Maximilian was probably acquainted with the puritan martyr Alexander Leighton, and his son, Edmund, sat for parliament in 1660.<br>
<br>Petty is renowned for his contribution to the Putney debates, the discussions of the New Model Army and civilians in autumn 1647 concerning the settlement of the nation. That summer he attended talks over the army's terms for settlement, <span class="italic">The Heads of the Proposals</span>. Soon afterwards, as he described at Putney, it &#145;pleased God to raise a company of men that do stand up for the power of the House of Commons&#146;  (Woodhouse, 89). Petty became acquainted with these men and a cipher key suggests his involvement over the summer in their attempts to forge links with and influence the New Model's agitator organization. By autumn this civilian effort to secure a platform within the army reached its zenith when Petty and John Wildman brought a counter-proposal for settlement, the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>, to the army general council on 28 October. Possibly the work of Wildman on behalf of his and Petty's associates in London the <span class="italic">Agreement</span> was a written constitution calling for a new social compact between the people and their rulers, far more radical terms for settlement than those of the army. None the less the paper split the general council and became the focus of fierce debate, during which Petty (or Pettus as the clerks recorded his name) expressed hostility to the negative voice of king and lords. However, his comments on the franchise, which dominated debate on 29 October, have attracted most attention. The <span class="italic">Agreement</span>, with its demand for a more equal redistribution of the electorate &#145;according to the number of the inhabitants&#146; and Petty's remark that &#145;We judge that all inhabitants that have not lost their birthright should have an equal voice in elections&#146; were interpreted (perhaps correctly) by the generals and their supporters as a call for manhood suffrage  (ibid., 444, 53). Yet towards the end of the debate and in an attempt to reach a compromise position on the franchise Petty referred to his willingness to &#145;exclude apprentices, or servants, or those that take alms&#146;  (ibid., 83). The <span class="italic">Agreement</span> would never be realized without the support of the New Model, and compromise on the franchise, probably not the most important proposal, was an attempt to secure it. The tactic failed when in committee the army addressed the majority of concerns voiced by soldiers who supported the <span class="italic">Agreement</span>. The outcome in November was an army <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>, based on the New Model's terms for settlement, which excluded the civilian proposals. The generals subsequently turned on Petty and his disruptive associates, identifying as Levellers those who sought to &#145;take away all kind of distinction of [king or lords] from other men&#146;  (ibid., 123).<br>
<br>By contriving a second civil war in 1648 Charles I turned the New Model's generals against him. Although parliament resumed negotiations with the defeated king the army vehemently opposed the discussions and courted support from well-affected Londoners. In November, meetings between Levellers and City Independents saw their proposals for settlement sent to army headquarters. Later that month Petty, Wildman, John Lilburne, and William Wetton journeyed to Windsor to express the Levellers' remaining concerns to the commissary-general, Henry Ireton. As a result it was agreed that a committee of sixteen, consisting of four MPs, army officers, City Independents, and Levellers, would draw up a second <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> as the basis for a settlement. Petty was chosen as a Leveller representative and attended the committee's meetings at Windsor and at Whitehall, which produced a draft document. When in December the draft was submitted for debate by the council of officers it is unclear whether he sided with those Levellers who protested at the conduct of the talks. He is not listed among the large Leveller delegation that presented Sir Thomas Fairfax with a petition critical of proceedings, yet neither was he among the Levellers who attended the council's debates after the precipitate withdrawal of the Leveller leader Lilburne. When in March 1649 Leveller criticism of the new military regime prompted the arrest of their leading figures Petty was not among them. Nevertheless Thomas Scott, the Commonwealth's intelligencer, considered him one of the principal Levellers who remained at liberty and questioned him regarding their activities.<br>
<br>The Levellers' demise during 1649 brought a temporary halt to Petty's political pursuits. By April 1650 he, Wildman, and Wetton were employed in administering the estates of the republican MP Henry Marten. Marten was a member of the 1648 committee of sixteen and his close ties with the Levellers during the late 1640s suggest that he may have known all three men earlier. Alongside Wetton, Petty was a co-administrator of Marten's Derbyshire estates and also assisted in administering the MP's Berkshire lands. By autumn 1659 his political activities resumed in London where both he and Wildman attended James Harrington's republican club, the Rota. This select debating society of metropolitan intellectuals discussed and voted on issues of popular government. John Aubrey described Petty as &#145;a very able man in these matters, and who had more then once turn'd the councill-board of Oliver Cromwell&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 1.290). Although the Rota was short-lived Petty's republican ties may have been of longer duration. In 1661 a Mr Pretty reportedly met in London with a small group of republicans, including Wildman. Under questioning that November Wildman denied knowing a Mr Pretty but offered that he knew a Mr Petty, an associate of the duke of Buckingham. Buckingham was involved in intrigue with Wildman and Lilburne in the 1650s and could conceivably have known Petty through them. If Wildman was referring to Maximilian Petty it is the last surviving record of him, his place and date of death being unknown.<br>
