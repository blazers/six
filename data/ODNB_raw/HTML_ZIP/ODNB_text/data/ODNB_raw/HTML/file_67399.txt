<span class="headword">Dubois,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was baptized on 24 February 1622 in Canterbury, Kent, the son of Jean Dubois (<i>d</i>. 1680), physician of Canterbury, and his wife, Catherine de l'Espine. Reared in the French Reformed community of Canterbury, Dubois became active in the French church at Threadneedle Street, London, by the 1650s and eventually became a deacon and an elder. On 11 January 1652 he married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13080/', "Charles Herle")</script>, presbyterian rector of Winwick, Lancashire, and one-time prolocutor of the Westminster assembly. The following year he became free of the London Weavers' Company, presumably upon the completion of an apprenticeship, and he eventually developed a lucrative overseas trade, chiefly as a silk importer from France. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8113/', "Charles Dubois")</script> was baptized on 10 September 1658 at St Mary Aldermanbury.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1662, after the death of his first wife, Dubois married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1715), daughter of Daniel Waldo and Anne Claxton. His second marriage further strengthened his ties to English nonconformity, connecting him to a leading London Independent family. His commercial and political career would keep him associated with civic nonconformists thereafter. In 1670, for instance, he joined London dissenters in a major loan to Charles II intended to undermine implementation of the new <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span>. Upset by French commercial competition and tariffs, Dubois joined Thomas Papillon, Sir Patience Ward, and other prominent dissenting and French Reformed merchants in promoting the proposals for English commerce put forward in <span class="italic">A Scheme of the Trade &hellip; between England and France</span> (1674). He also became a trustee for presbyterian Dr Thomas Gouge's fund to establish schools and to promote literacy in Wales. From 1672 or earlier Dubois resided in St Mary Aldermanbury, London, where he served as churchwarden in 1672&#150;4, and where his children were baptized. Dubois was also a friend of Canterbury dean John Tillotson, who was a trustee for Gouge's fund, and who retained numerous dissenting connections after conforming.<br>
<br>Dubois was elected to the London common council for Cripplegate Within ward in 1674, and served until 1682. He quickly became a leader of the opposition that emerged in the city as the ministry of Thomas Osborne, earl of Danby, sought to revive the coercive Anglican polity first erected in 1662&#150;5. In March 1675, just before the dramatic parliamentary session of that year, Dubois confronted Danby's civic prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Lord Mayor Sir Robert Vyner, in common council, claiming that Vyner and the court of aldermen had &#145;invaded&#146; the rights of the court of common council in making a minor corporation judicial appointment  (Coventry MS 16, fol. 9). At court Dubois was counted among those in the city who &#145;hate Prerogative&#146; and who were provoking trouble for the benefit of country spokesmen in the Commons  (BL, Add. MS 34362, fol. 14). He was nevertheless appointed as a London assessment commissioner for 1677&#150;80. Drawing upon the influence of his business associate and brother-in-law, the Liverpool merchant Charles Herle, he was also returned as Liverpool MP for each of the parliaments of 1679&#150;81.<br>
<br>Dubois was at the centre of parliamentary and London affairs during the crisis of 1679&#150;83. He believed that English protestantism was as vulnerable in those years as it had been in the 1640s, accusing the Jesuits of advancing their cause again by &#145;divid[ing] Protestants from Protestants&#146;  (Grey, 7.414). Parliament must &#145;determine the Succession&#146; through the exclusion of the Catholic duke of York, he urged his fellow MPs in May 1679, and he served on a Commons' committee for the speedier conviction of recusants  (ibid., 7.238). Between parliaments Dubois aided in the election of the dissenters Henry Cornish and Slingsby Bethel as sheriffs of London and Middlesex for 1680&#150;81. In the 1680&#150;81 parliament he was the first speaker on behalf of the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, warning that, &#145;If the Catholics have such an influence upon the Government under a Protestant Prince, what will they have under a Popish?&#146;  (ibid., 7.396). He was equally supportive of endeavours to promote protestant union, and served on the Commons' committee to prepare a bill to achieve it. When the Commons adopted the <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span>, Dubois served on a corporation of London committee that addressed Charles II on its behalf. And when Charles instead prorogued parliament, in January 1681, Dubois sat on another civic committee that drafted a petition to the crown for an immediate resumption of the session. Dubois took a similar role in the short-lived third Exclusion Parliament of March 1681, serving on committees for another <span class="roman">Exclusion Bill</span> and for conferring with the Lords about the irregular loss of a bill, approved in the previous parliament, for repealing the Elizabethan statute against sectarians. His outspoken views did not prevent him from serving with the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London on a committee that met weekly in 1681 to distribute money for the relief of arriving French protestant refugees.<br>
<br>As Charles II's efforts to resolve the crisis on his terms moved from parliament to the city, Dubois stood firmly against him. He was among those who out-manoeuvred civic loyalists in securing another corporation address on behalf of a new parliament in May 1681. He was impanelled by the city's whig sheriffs for the jury that rejected the crown's treason case against the earl of Shaftesbury. On that occasion his detractors claimed that he called the king a papist. In January 1682 he was chosen as a member of the corporation committee to defend the London charter against the crown's <i>quo warranto</i>. As the 1682 midsummer's election of sheriffs approached, and as the crown embarked upon strategies to secure the election of loyalists, the London whigs settled upon Dubois and Thomas Papillon as their candidates. Just prior to the election, a whig effort to secure a vacant aldermanic place for Dubois miscarried. The shrieval election itself was the most protracted contest in the city's electoral history, requiring several common halls and polls between June and September, by which time Dubois had also been elected master of the Weavers' Company. A majority of civic electors clearly favoured Dubois and Papillon, but the crown was determined to prevent their election.<br>
<br>Dubois and Papillon appeared at the Guildhall on 28 September 1682 for the taking of the shrieval oaths. Loyalist Lord Mayor Sir John Moore instead swore in tory candidates Dudley North and Peter Rich and forced their whig rivals from the hustings. As the court and London loyalists celebrated victory, the whig aldermen took bonds from Dubois and Papillon to serve as sheriffs; and the pair were feasted by Shaftesbury and other whig lords as sheriffs-elect. Indeed, the following day the two whigs wrangled with North and Rich about who should preside, as sheriffs, at the beginning of the mayoral election for 1682&#150;3. After loyalist aldermen adjusted a mayoral poll to advance tory Sir William Pritchard over whig Henry Cornish, the contest for the corporation entered the courts. Recognized by the whigs as the legitimate civic magistrates, Dubois and Papillon sued in king's bench for the shrievalty, and Henry Cornish sued for the mayoralty. The whigs advanced Dubois, without success, for another vacant aldermanic place in December. He was apparently the object of an attempted legal entrapment when a government informer offered him seditious papers; and Cripplegate loyalists secured his replacement on common council for 1683. In the meantime, the government's interference in the London elections turned some whigs to plotting resistance, and John Locke and Algernon Sidney to defending it.<br>
<br>The legal contest for the London shrievalty reached its climax in April 1683. Lord Mayor Pritchard and several loyalist aldermen were then briefly arrested, on writs taken out by attorney Richard Goodenough, for their failure to respond to Dubois's and Papillon's suits for office. Dubois and his colleague hastily distanced themselves from Goodenough's action. Whether they had any awareness of the seditious conspiracy in which Goodenough and several of his accomplices in making the arrests were already involved seems unlikely. Plot ringleader Robert West apparently feared that Dubois and Papillon might hesitate to seize office in an insurrection, in which case they would need to be &#145;knocked on the head&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.420). Dubois's hope of securing the shrievalty by legal means collapsed in May when king's bench convicted several leading London whigs of committing a riot in the course of the election. He was disarmed after the disclosure of whig plotting in June, but the government took no further action against him.<br>
<br>Dubois died in October 1684 and was buried on 30 October at St Mary Aldermanbury; he was survived by his wife. His death occurred just days before the hearing of Sir William Pritchard's suit against him and Papillon for false arrest. Dubois's personal estate was valued at over &pound;35,000. He owned land in Carmarthen, Kent, and Surrey, where he had a house at Mitcham. He also owned stock in the East India Company and served on its directing committee from 1681 until his death. At his request, John Tillotson preached his funeral sermon.<br>
