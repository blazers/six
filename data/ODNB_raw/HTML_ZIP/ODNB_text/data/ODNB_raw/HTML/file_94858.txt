<span class="headword">Holland,  Joan Mary  Crossley-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Joan Mary Cowper]</span>  (1912&#150;2005), <span class="occ">potter and gallery owner</span>, was born on 3 April 1912 at Peatling Magna, Lutterworth, Leicestershire, the daughter of Claude Marriott Lovell Cowper, medical doctor, and his wife, Mary Bourne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Collard, a nurse who was also a gifted amateur artist. Unusually she was educated at a Plymouth Brethren boys' school before going to Wycombe Abbey and the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She became a gifted potter, designed for Doulton, and was exhibited at Heal's and Liberty. Following her marriage on 10 September 1939 to the composer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75869/', "Peter Charles Crossley-Holland (1916&#150;2001)")</script> she resigned her career in favour of full-time housewifery and parenting of their son and daughter. The marriage lasted several decades and after its painful dissolution with marvellous improbability Joan Crossley-Holland through the introduction of a friend managed the fabulous Lake Palace Hotel in Udaipur for the maharana of Mewar. India is a country where art and craft are indissolubly linked and the experience also led to a store of wonderful stories with which her colleagues were later entertained.<br>
<br>With both administrative and art experience, Joan Crossley-Holland became the manager of the Bear Lane Gallery in Oxford after her return to England in the mid-1960s. The gallery had held pioneering exhibitions in the 1950s and 1960s of contemporary British art, often with the help of the Arts Council and the brightest of critics and art historians, an achievement continued under Crossley-Holland's stewardship; but the trustees balked at Crossley-Holland's idea of exhibiting craft, denouncing potters as the producers of (mere) casseroles. Crossley-Holland therefore struck out independently, founding in 1968 the Oxford Gallery at 23 High Street. She was backed with a minimum of capital from dons and enthusiasts who believed in the worth of the cause.<br>
<br>The Oxford Gallery was one of the first commercial craft and art galleries to be professionally designed for its purpose, by the architect Michael Brawne, a specialist in museums. In the face of high college rents, impossible parking, and initially an indifferent or even unsympathetic environment and without public subsidy, the gallery carried on as a genuine pioneer (and indeed long outlived the Bear Lane Gallery). Its tone was set by Crossley-Holland's robust and implacable perseverance, commitment, and belief in the work she exhibited. In her eighteen years as managing director, the work of artists was shown in more than 180 exhibitions; the judicious mingling of the known and unknown was authoritative, and visits to all the graduating shows of the leading art colleges led to many a discovery. The gallery's mix of fine art, notably prints and occasionally paintings, and the crafts in all media was unique and unexpected.<br>
<br>Crossley-Holland's extraordinarily well-developed aesthetic sense, immense knowledge, and commitment often turned window shoppers into collectors. However her occasional bossiness, fussiness, frankness, and even determination not to charm could at times alienate rather than soothe; her staff were used to picking up the pieces. Happy to educate, she was nevertheless intolerant of mental dullness. She believed with passion that an appreciation, even better ownership, of fine contemporary pieces enhanced life; the standards of the gallery were, for the time, outstanding. Some of the more rarefied artists objected to the creative jumble that at times characterized the gallery's displays, but the intention to be more of a shop than a gallery was designed to disarm those potential clients who might be intimidated by the typically austere art gallery displays that mimicked the museums of the day and could seem unapproachable.<br>
<br>The Oxford Gallery antedated by several years the Crafts Advisory Council and its successor the Crafts Council, and no one at the time could have foreseen the expansion of interest in contemporary applied arts and in contemporary craft and design on the part of both museums and the major auction houses. The genuine transformation of the climate for craft in Britain by the early twenty-first century, the proliferation of museum collections and of dedicated galleries within museums, and the growth of public and private collections owed a great deal to Crossley-Holland's robust character and determined advocacy. In 1984 and 1985 the gallery held innovative exhibitions outdoors in the gardens, designed by Harold Peto, of High Wall in Headington, Oxford (owned by Brian Beynon Lloyd, first director of Oxford Polytechnic and chairman of the board of the Oxford Gallery), which mixed everything from wicker baskets to fountains to huge outsize pots. These exhibitions illustrated magnificently the possibilities for objects displayed and integrated into the man-made landscape. In tribute to Crossley-Holland after her retirement to Suffolk in 1986, the Oxford Gallery staged another indoor&#150;outdoor show in the conservatory at the Barbican. The Oxford Gallery continued as a significant and important outlet for ceramics, glass, textiles, furniture, jewellery, and artists' prints for another fifteen years after her retirement. Moreover, a number of her fellow directors and assistants went on to influential careers in the promotion of contemporary craft in public and private contexts. Not only did the Contemporary Art Society purchase from the gallery but the Ashmolean Museum benefited directly from gifts and bequests from collectors nurtured by Crossley-Holland and by donations of craft in her honour and in that of her successor, Valerie Stewart.<br>
<br>Crossley-Holland was always impeccably and neatly dressed with an old-fashioned approach to fashion, looking more like a bustling headmistress than a gallery owner. Beautifully made up, and with a preference for subdued colours from sludge green to rust red, she did however sport the unexpected piece of avant garde jewellery. Her artists attested to her loyalty; it was on their behalf that she was such a formidable figure. She had a surprisingly gentle descent into the classic ailments of old age, ending her days at Pinford End House nursing home, Hawstead, Suffolk, near her son, the poet and children's author, Kevin Crossley-Holland, whose own professed delight was devotion to East Anglia. She died at Pinford End House on 12 January 2005, of Alzheimer's disease; both her son and her daughter survived her.<br>
