<span class="headword">Pelham,  Frederick Thomas</span>  (1808&#150;1861), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 2 August 1808, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21799/', "Thomas Pelham, second earl of Chichester (1756&#150;1826)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Mary Henrietta Juliana (1776&#150;1862), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20876/', "Francis Osborne, the fifth duke of Leeds")</script>. He entered the navy on 27 June 1823, and served as a midshipman aboard the <i>Sybille</i>, Captain Samuel John Brooke Pechell, in the Mediterranean. Here he was present at an attack on Greek pirates. In 1829 he passed his examination for lieutenant, and was promoted on 22 February 1830. He then served in the <i>Ferret</i> during 1831&#150;2 and from May 1832 until his promotion to commander, on 21 September 1835, in the <i>Castor</i>, Captain Lord John Hay, on the north coast of Spain during the Carlist War. Between June 1837 and the autumn of 1838 he commanded the <i>Tweed</i> on the same station, and was awarded the Spanish cross of San Fernando on 9 August 1839 in recognition of his efforts.<br>
<br>Pelham was promoted captain on 3 July 1840. On 26 July 1841 he married Ellen Kate (<i>d</i>. 8 Jan 1900), daughter of Rowland Mitchell; they had four children. Between May 1847 and June 1850 he commanded the steam paddle frigate <i>Odin</i> in the Mediterranean. In March 1852 he was appointed private secretary to the first lord of the Admiralty, the duke of Northumberland, and he remained in the post until the end of the year. He was appointed at the suggestion of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, the senior naval lord. This was a difficult post, when the ministers were anxious to keep down the estimates and reverse the strong tide of political support for the whigs in the dockyards. It was not rendered any easier by the politics of Pelham's brother, the third earl, and his close connections with Sir Francis Baring. Pelham was on particularly bad terms with Stafford O'Brien, the political secretary. His testimony on the 1853 select committee on dockyard appointments, which investigated Stafford's handling of patronage, was remarkably circumspect. On 14 August 1853 he was appointed to the <i>Blenheim</i>, to command the Portsmouth steam reserve, and aboard the same ship took a distinguished part in the Baltic campaign of 1854, notably at the capture of Bomarsund in August, where his initiative and skill in landing a heavy gun to support the attack were commended. In November 1854 he was appointed to the new battleship <i>Exmouth</i>, but in February 1855, before she was completed, he was selected by his friend Rear-Admiral Richard Saunders Dundas for the demanding position of captain of the fleet for the second Baltic campaign.<br>
<br>Pelham's experience proved invaluable to Dundas, and he directed the attack on Sveaborg (8&#150;10 August), the major operation of the year. Others were less impressed, however. Captain Bartholomew James Sulivan, the brilliant surveying officer, attributed much of Dundas's caution to Pelham's influence. In June 1856 Pelham returned to the steam reserve. Ironically, given his experience in 1852, in December 1856 Sir Maurice Berkeley declined to have him at the Board of Admiralty, despite his ability and experience, claiming he was still connected with Northumberland and thus politically suspect. In November 1857 Berkeley retired and Pelham rejoined Dundas, now at the Admiralty under Sir Charles Wood. He left office with the ministry in March 1858. The place had been conditional on his being prepared to enter parliament, but he was not called upon to do so. On 3 March 1838 he was promoted rear-admiral. Pelham joined the new Liberal board in June 1859, now as second naval lord under the duke of Somerset and Dundas. He remained there until early June 1861, when he resigned on account of ill health. He died at 8 Waterloo Street, Hove, on 21 June 1861, and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Pelham's career was made by his family and political connections, and his command appointments and critical promotions were all secured under whig/Liberal ministries. His efficient conduct of operations and administration demonstrated that he had considerable ability, but he was never tested in high command.<br>
