<span class="headword">Menasseh ben Israel</span>  (1604&#150;1657), <span class="occ">rabbi and campaigner for the readmission of Jews to England</span>, was born in Portugal. His parents, Joseph (ben Israel) Soeiro and Rachel Abrabanel, were Marranos (secret Jews) and they emigrated to Amsterdam while Menasseh was still a child. He studied with the celebrated Rabbi Isaac Uziel, but never really succeeded in establishing himself as a respected and financially secure scholar in the Jewish community at Amsterdam. His first appointment came in 1622, as rabbi of the Neveh Shalom congregation, the &#145;poor relation&#146; of Amsterdam's three synagogues. About this time, or within the next few years, he married Rachel, whose other name is unknown. His salary was extremely low, so Menasseh supplemented his income by establishing the city's first Hebrew printing house, enjoying a monopoly until about 1633, and continuing to publish Hebrew books until he left for England over twenty years later. Menasseh was the only Jew to take part in the Frankfurt bookfair in 1634, and one of his booklists from the 1640s survives among the papers of John Selden, noting the names of eight used books and the prices paid for them. When Menasseh's congregation was united with that of the other two synagogues in 1639, he was relegated to the task of teaching the primary school, with the face-saving perk of a monthly sermon to the newly organized community.<br>
<br>Yet Menasseh's lack of success in Amsterdam's Jewish world stood in stark contrast to his high reputation outside it. Indeed, after his first book, published in Hebrew in 1628, Menasseh wrote only one more work in that language, which in any case was dedicated to a Christian sovereign and had an argument in Latin. Most of the rabbi's books were published in Spanish or Latin, and sometimes simultaneously in both. His most famous early work was undoubtedly his <span class="italic">Conciliador</span>, published in Spanish in four parts between 1632 and 1651. Part one was an analysis of 180 discrepancies in the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, achieved by the citation of 221 Jewish and 54 gentile authorities. The other parts of the work dealt with the rest of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> in turn. The <span class="italic">Conciliador</span> was an overnight success among non-Jewish theologians, in no small measure because it was a learned Jewish work that contained not a single attack against Christianity. His entry into the bibliographies of Christian theology assured, Menasseh followed his advantage with several other learned works. <span class="italic">De creatione problemata XXX</span> appeared in 1635, followed by <span class="italic">De resurrectione mortuorum</span> in 1636, and <span class="italic">De termino vitae</span> in 1639. Only the appearance of his <span class="italic">Dissertatio de fragilitate humana</span> in 1642 in Spanish and Latin marked some measure of acceptance by Jews as well as Christians. Menasseh also published a Portuguese compendium of Jewish law for returning Marranos, which must have found its way into the hands of Christians seeking a concise outline of Hebrew customs.<br>
<br>By the 1640s Menasseh ben Israel had very nearly become the ambassador of western Jewry to European Christendom. His correspondents included G. J. Vossius, his son Isaac Vossius, Hugo Grotius, John Durie, and many others. Nevertheless, Menasseh's reputation among Christian scholars was not matched either by his financial or intellectual standing among the Jews of Amsterdam, a fact underscored in May 1640 when he was actually excommunicated for one day, and a fine (valued at nearly half of his annual salary) levied against him as punishment for an overly heated defence of his brother-in-law at a synagogue meeting. Menasseh made preparations to emigrate to Brazil, to the astonishment of Grotius and others, but in the event managed to obtain a position in Amsterdam as director of the community school and a lecturer at the <i>yeshivah</i> (religious academy). In 1644 he was appointed principal of the newly established Talmudic academy founded by the affluent Pereira brothers, Abraham and Isaac, who had just arrived from Venice.<br>
<br>Despite having achieved a measure of financial security, Menasseh carried on with the business contacts that he had already established during the lean years. Both of his sons were involved in the family printing house, and the elder one, Joseph, acted as Menasseh's personal emissary to agents in Poland. It was there, in Lublin, that Joseph ben Israel died in 1648, consigning to oblivion the large quantity of goods and cash that he had in his possession. This was the final blow for Menasseh's foreign investments: he shared commercial interests with his brother Ephraim Soeiro in the Dutch port of Pernambuco (Recife) which was under Portuguese siege from 1645, and by the time Joseph died Menasseh was out of business in the New World as well as the Old.<br>
<br>Menasseh's mission to secure the readmission of the Jews to England began when a Jew by the name of Antonio Montezinos returned to Amsterdam in 1644 from South America, claiming that he had made contact there with Hebrew-speaking remnants of the lost ten tribes of Israel. Menasseh was entranced by this revelation, and saw it as fulfilling another part of the messianic precondition of the scattering of the Jews to all corners of the globe. A Jewish presence in England would complete the square, but they had been expelled by Edward I in 1290. When an English trade delegation led by Oliver St John visited Menasseh in his synagogue in 1650, the question of Jewish readmission was broached, and the rabbi's campaign was launched.<br>
<br>Menasseh received a passport and permission to visit England in 1650 and in every year until his arrival in September 1655, after the end of the trade war between England and the Netherlands. He became well known to the English public with the appearance of his book about the Montezinos affair, <span class="italic">The Hope of Israel</span> (1650). Menasseh himself spent the years 1650&#150;55 in an effort to win a place at the court of Queen Kristina of Sweden, hoping to turn himself into the Jewish Descartes of the north. When Kristina abdicated in June 1654 she left unpaid a large book bill owed to Menasseh, and he took the bold and quite illegal step of travelling to her retreat at Antwerp, where she received him favourably and eventually gave him his due. Menasseh was now free from the distractions of this troublesome side-show and could concentrate on the readmission.<br>
<br>Menasseh's son Samuel ben Israel came to England in October 1654 in order to test the waters, accompanied by another Jew named Manuel Martinez Dormido, who immediately petitioned Oliver Cromwell for the recovery of lands lost in the Portuguese conquest of Dutch territory. On 26 February 1655 the protector did indeed write to the king of Portugal on Dormido's behalf, perhaps an indication of Cromwell's favourable disposition to the Jews at that moment. Samuel also reported to his father that he had received a doctorate from Oxford University in the dual fields of medicine and philosophy. The document was forged, but Menasseh was unaware of this. Moved by his son's report, in September 1655 Menasseh addressed an open letter to the Jewish people, informing them of his mission and recent favourable messianic developments. By the Jewish new year (22 September 1655) Menasseh was in London, and on 31 October he formally submitted a petition for the readmission of the Jews to England.<br>
<br>The council of state received Menasseh's requests, and on 13 November 1655 appointed a subcommittee, which seems to have returned its favourable report on the very same day, consisting as it did of seven of the eleven members of the council physically present. They also adopted Cromwell's strategy of spreading the political risk by appointing a conference to meet at Whitehall, directed to thrash out the pros and cons of readmitting Jews to England. The conference was opened by Cromwell himself on 4 December near the chambers of the council of state. The delegates were theologians, politicians, and merchants, and they held further sittings on 7, 12, 14, and 18 December. Menasseh ben Israel was not invited, and did not attend even the final, public session. In the event, Cromwell was unable to obtain an unequivocal endorsement of readmission, so he dissolved the conference rather than suffer a formal rejection of the proposal.<br>
<br>The irony of Menasseh's mission was that there already were a number of secret Jews in England, pretending to be Roman Catholic Spanish and Portuguese, and his campaign cast an unwelcome spotlight on their affairs. Most probably they would have continued in this clandestine Marrano fashion for much longer had not England gone to war with Spain at the beginning of 1656, rendering their goods and property liable to confiscation as belonging to enemy aliens. The denunciation of one of their leaders forced England's secret Jews to throw off their Spanish disguises and to jump on Menasseh's tarnished bandwagon.<br>
<br>The famous petition of England's Jewish community was received by Cromwell on 24 March 1656. Little choice had been left to them but to request readmission and to throw themselves on the mercies of the protector, whose sympathetic views had already been amply revealed. Menasseh ben Israel was the first signatory, and within a few weeks had completed his <span class="italic">Vindiciae Judaeorum</span>, his powerful refutation of slanders against the Jewish people, which has been translated and reprinted many times during the past three centuries.<br>
<br>But Cromwell never gave a formal answer to the Jews' petition, preferring to turn a blind eye to their presence. After the failure of the Whitehall conference he could hardly do otherwise. Yet Menasseh ben Israel failed to realize that a new era had begun for Jews in England. His single-minded dedication to obtaining a formal declaration of Jewish toleration and freedom of worship blinded him to the substantial benefits which had been achieved informally, and to the practical determination of the English government to allow the Jews to continue living in England unmolested. Menasseh thus alienated the leaders of Anglo-Jewry, who were anxious to effect a smooth transition to toleration, and they turned their backs on him. Sometime during 1656 they agreed to bring over Rabbi Moses Athias from Hamburg to lead their congregation. Menasseh may have been considered for the post, but there is no evidence that his name was put forward at all. He seems to have been ill for some time in any case, and was forced to turn to Cromwell for assistance. The protector granted him a state pension of &pound;100 per annum, payable quarterly and commencing from 20 February 1657. At least two payments of &pound;25 each were made to Menasseh between Michaelmas 1656 and Michaelmas 1658.<br>
<br>By the middle of September 1657 Menasseh's hopes and patience were finally exhausted. His son Samuel having recently died, Menasseh turned to Cromwell once again for financial help to enable him to carry the body back to the Netherlands. Menasseh offered to surrender his pension seal for &pound;300, and to cease troubling Cromwell with his millennial dreams and pleas for aid. Menasseh apparently was willing to renounce his pension for even &pound;200 because of the intense pressure of his debts and his need to return to the Netherlands immediately. The sum seems not to have been paid, and in November Menasseh was forced to return empty-handed, but he never reached Amsterdam, and died <i>en route</i> in Middelburg on about 20 November. Samuel ben Israel was buried there, but Menasseh's body was carried to the Jewish cemetery at Ouderkerk near Amsterdam, where he was laid to rest.<br>
<br>Menasseh's widow, Rachel, was left destitute and was forced to rely on charity. Before Cromwell's death in September 1658 she sent him several begging letters, which were entrusted to John Thurloe and John Sadler, long a friend of the Jews. By the beginning of January 1659 she had persuaded Sadler to plead her case before Richard Cromwell. Sadler asked the new protector to pay the &pound;200 &#145;to the said Widow, &amp; Relations of a Man so Eminent &amp; ffamous in his owne &amp; many other Nations; &amp; for the honour of Christian Religio with many other Reasons&#146;. It is not known whether Richard Cromwell honoured his father's debt.<br>
