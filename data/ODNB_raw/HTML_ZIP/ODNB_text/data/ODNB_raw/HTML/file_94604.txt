<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  Avril  Coleridge-</span>  (1903&#150;1998), <span class="occ">composer and conductor</span>, was born Gwendolen Coleridge-Taylor on 8 March 1903 at 10 Upper Grove, South Norwood, Croydon, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32492/', "Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875&#150;1912)")</script>, composer and conductor, and his wife, Jessie Sarah Fleetwood, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Walmisley (1869&#150;1962). She had one older brother, Hiawatha (1900&#150;1980). She was only nine years old when her father died of pneumonia.<br>
<br>Avril Coleridge-Taylor (she adopted the name Avril in childhood) wrote and published her first composition, <span class="italic">Goodbye Butterfly</span>, at the age of twelve. In the same year she won a scholarship in composition and pianoforte at Trinity College of Music, London. She studied the violin, orchestration, composition, and conducting, and later reflected:<blockquote>Quite early in life I began to feel a sense of music within me that was anxious to make its way out. Not only did I want to write music&#151;as I had seen my father do&#151;but to express myself through beautiful sound. (Coleridge-Taylor, 103)</blockquote>During her career she wrote more than ninety compositions. These included a piano concerto in F minor, <span class="italic">Sussex Landscape</span>, <span class="italic">The Hills</span>, <span class="italic">To April</span>, <span class="italic">In Memoriam R. A. F.</span>, and <span class="italic">Golden Wedding Ballet Suite</span> for orchestra, and <span class="italic">Wyndore</span> and <span class="italic">Historical Episode</span> for chorus and orchestra. Over thirty-five songs written between 1917 and 1971 included &#145;Who Knows?&#146; (1922), &#145;The Dreaming Water Lily&#146; (1923), &#145;Regret&#146; (1939), &#145;O'er all the Hill-Tops&#146; (1957), and &#145;I Can Face It, Lord&#146; (1971).<br>
<br>In 1933 Coleridge-Taylor made her London d&eacute;but as a conductor at the Royal Albert Hall and thereafter she conducted an orchestra and singers on several occasions there in her father's most famous work, <span class="italic">Hiawatha</span>. As a guest she conducted several major orchestras including the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra. She was the first woman to conduct the band of the Royal Marines. She also founded and conducted several orchestras and ensembles including the Coleridge-Taylor Symphony Orchestra.<br>
<br>Coleridge-Taylor's first marriage, on 19 April 1924 to the musician Harold Christian Dashwood, ended in divorce. They had one son, Nigel Christian, born on Christmas eve 1924. Her second marriage, to another musician, Bruce Somes-Charlton, on 28 January 1946, also ended in divorce.<br>
<br>Because her father was of mixed race (of African and British parentage) and her mother was white, Coleridge-Taylor could pass as white. In 1952 she visited South Africa for a concert tour, but felt guilty staying in accommodation intended for whites. When the South African authorities discovered that she was of part African descent she found herself cold-shouldered. Offers of work, including a job as a music teacher, were withdrawn, and Britain's high commissioner warned her that she was risking imprisonment for passing as white. Left penniless, destitute, and in distress, she returned to Britain. Continuing her career in music, in 1956 she arranged and conducted the spirituals performed in a BBC radio version of the American play <span class="italic">The Green Pastures</span>, and the following year she wrote the ceremonial march to celebrate Ghana's independence. However, her experiences in South Africa led to a breakdown and, though she continued to make occasional attempts at writing music, she eventually gave up. In 1979 she published an autobiography, <span class="italic">The Heritage of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor</span>.<br>
<br>Avril Coleridge-Taylor died on 21 December 1998 at Stones House, Crouch Lane, Seaford, Sussex. According to her son Nigel, who survived her:<blockquote>she considered herself an Englishwoman, not coloured. At first [she] did not take on her African ancestry, but her experience in South Africa brought it home to her. It surprised her. In the music world [she] was discriminated against more as a coloured woman than as a woman. She felt keenly that she ought to take her place among the greatest. But the people in the classical music profession disadvantaged her because of what she was. (private information)</blockquote>
