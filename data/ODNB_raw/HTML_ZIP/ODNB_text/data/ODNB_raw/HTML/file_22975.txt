<span class="headword">Radcliffe,  James</span>, styled third earl of Derwentwater  (1689&#150;1716), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born in Arlington Street, London, on 28 June 1689, the eldest son of Edward, second earl of Derwentwater (1655&#150;1705), and Lady Mary Tudor (1673&#150;1726), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5144/', "Charles II")</script> and the actress Mary (Moll) Davies. He descended from a long Roman Catholic and royalist ancestry. His grandfather, Sir Francis Radcliffe, third baronet (1625&#150;1696), was raised to the earldom of Derwentwater in March 1688, one of the few peerages created by James II. With five adult sons in 1689, he was feared as the most dangerous Jacobite in the north-east; he refused the oaths to William and Mary and was briefly imprisoned in 1691. James Radcliffe's parents parted in 1700 because the countess remained implacably opposed to becoming a Roman Catholic. In 1702, together with his younger brothers Francis (1691&#150;1715) and <a href="#cosubject_22975">Charles Radcliffe (1693&#150;1746) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, James was sent to the Stuart court at St Germain at the request of Queen Mary, widow of James II, to be a companion and fellow pupil of Prince James Francis Edward, his kinsman.<br>
<br>His personal attachment to Prince James, his ancestry, and his religion coalesced to make Radcliffe a fervent Jacobite. He succeeded to the earldom in April 1705 and appears to have undertaken a grand tour before engaging in the disastrous Jacobite expedition of 1708; he was captured on board the French prize <i>Le Salisbury</i> but released, presumably because he was under age. In November 1709 he and his brothers obtained a licence to return to England. In 1710 he travelled throughout the north to establish contact with his kinsfolk and to inspect his numerous estates, which included agricultural properties in the border counties, collieries in Northumberland and Durham, and extensive lead-mining interests on Alston Moor. He also began to form a circle of friends, mostly Roman Catholics and Jacobites, of whom he soon became the natural leader. He was described as personable, slim, fair, and an accomplished singer and guitarist; he enjoyed field sports and was hospitable and generous to his friends and charitable towards his tenants and employees, with whom he became popular. On 10 July 1712 Derwentwater married a childhood friend, Anna Maria Webb (1692/3&#150;1723), eldest daughter of Sir John Webb, third baronet, of Odstock, Wiltshire, and Barbara Belasyse, daughter and coheir of John, first Baron Belasyse; they had two children, John (<i>d</i>. 1731) and Anna Maria Barbara (1716&#150;1760)&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74981/', "Anna Maria Barbara Petre")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64188/', "Petre family")</script>]&#151;who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53220/', "Robert James Petre, eighth Baron Petre")</script> in 1732.<br>
<br>Derwentwater was one of the leaders to whom the execution of the northern contribution to the rising of 1715 was entrusted, though he was not given formal command because he was a Roman Catholic. He rose with his brother Charles and seventy men but he was bitterly disappointed that, despite many promises of support, only 200 Northumbrians joined them. Derwentwater showed considerable leadership and courage in action at Preston; he deplored Thomas Forster's capitulation, although the position was hopeless, and accepted it only to save further unnecessary bloodshed. He was impeached for treason and arraigned at the bar of the House of Lords on 19 January 1716. He pleaded guilty but said in mitigation that he had had no foreknowledge of the plot; that he had risen impulsively and without any military accoutrements; that he had acted with decent restraint while in arms; and that he had surrendered at the first opportunity. He protested his future loyalty and asked that his innocent young family's predicament be considered. Lord Chancellor Cowper scorned the arguments and condemned him to death; by an act of attainder his titles and estates were forfeited. Considerable efforts to obtain a reprieve were made: the House of Lords petitioned the king; various individual peers and peeresses made representations; and the pregnant countess even approached the king in person. It was said that Derwentwater contemptuously rejected a reprieve in return for his abjuring Jacobitism and renouncing his faith. It was also rumoured that Robert Walpole was offered a bribe to save him and that an armed party was ready to rescue him.<br>
<br>King and government were determined on his execution, however, fearing that his Stuart blood, his wealth, and his popularity would make further rebellion a continuing threat. On the scaffold Derwentwater regretted having pleaded guilty, declared his adherence to Roman Catholicism, and said that he had never owned any other but James III as his rightful king, whom he loved as a person and whom he had desired to serve since infancy. He was beheaded on Tower Hill on 24 February 1716 and immediately became a romantic martyr figure. A display of the aurora borealis coincided with the arrival in co. Durham of the hearse bearing his body for interment in the family vault in the chapel at Dilston; the phenomenon was thereafter known locally as Derwentwater's Lights. He was in addition portrayed as a tragic hero in a number of folk-songs or ballads; some Catholics treasured his relics and miracles were attributed to his intercession, and there were those who wanted him proclaimed a confessor for the faith. In 1874 the bodies of the three earls of Derwentwater were reinterred in the Petre family vault at Thorndon, Essex. In 1721, to prevent Lady Mary Tudor securing the guardianship of John Radcliffe, the countess and her father fled with both children to Brussels; she died, aged thirty, two years later and was buried in the convent of St Monica's, Louvain, where two Radcliffe aunts were professed. John, regarded by Jacobites and other sympathizers as the rightful fourth earl of Derwentwater, always a sickly boy, remained on the continent to complete his education. He returned to England for a medical consultation in August 1731 but his condition was hopeless and he died on 31 December, aged eighteen and unmarried, and was buried at Louvain.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22975"></a><span class="headword">Charles Radcliffe</span>, styled fifth earl of Derwentwater  (1693&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Jacobite conspirator</span>, was born at Little Parndon, Essex, on 3 September 1693. Along with his elder brother James he participated in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and surrendered at Preston. He was tried on 18 May 1716, found guilty, and sentenced to death, but his execution was deferred until July, and he obtained a further stay because of a changed public mood in favour of clemency. With several other Jacobite prisoners he escaped from Newgate on 11 December and fled to Urbino, where he lived in poverty, though he was later appointed the chevalier's agent in Paris. In 1723 he made his addresses to Charlotte Livingston [<a name="cosubject_22978"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Maria Radcliffe</span>, <i>suo jure</i> countess of Newburgh  (1694&#150;1755)], Jacobite sympathizer, posthumous daughter of Charles, second earl of Newburgh (<i>c</i>.1662&times;6&#150;1694) and Frances Brudenell (<i>c</i>.1672&#150;1736). At the time of Charles Radcliffe's advances she was a widow, having been married to Thomas Clifford (1687&#150;1719), second son of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh. She refused Radcliffe on fifteen occasions and submitted only when he climbed down the chimney of her boudoir on the sixteenth; they were married at Brussels on 24 June 1724. He took a commission in Fitzjames's regiment of the French army; he was active in freemasonry and became grand master of France, but he resigned in 1738 when the church proscribed the society. He later moved to Rome, where the Jacobite court had settled and where he had inherited a house in the Lingaria from his bachelor uncle William.<br>
<br>The forfeiture of the Radcliffe estates was prevented initially when it was shown that they were properly entailed on Derwentwater's son, John, but if he died under age they would be forfeited because his heir, Charles Radcliffe, was debarred as a convicted rebel, although the latter and his wife visited England incognito on several occasions to protect their children's rights of succession. At John's death in 1731 the estates fell to the crown during the lifetime of Charles Radcliffe who became titular fifth earl on his nephew's death and, to prevent their recovery by his sons at his death, the act 4 Geo. II c. 21 was passed, prohibiting foreign-born issue of convicted traitors inheriting English titles or landed estates. By 8 Geo. II c. 29 the revenue of the estates, some &pound;9000 p.a., was allocated to the completion of the Seamen's Hospital at Greenwich and for the maintenance of the seamen thereafter, although grants for the relief of Radcliffe's children were made and other entailed annuities and encumbrances were honoured. In 1745 Charles Radcliffe and his son James were taken by the British ship <i>Sheerness</i> while in the French privateer <i>Esperance</i>, bound for Scotland with arms for the Jacobites, and imprisoned in the Tower. They repudiated British jurisdiction and Charles claimed misidentification; James was freed and banished because he was a French citizen, but Charles was easily identified and condemned to death on his previous conviction for his part in the rising of 1715. He was beheaded on Tower Hill on 8 December 1746 and was buried in St Giles-in-the-Fields. His widow, who died on 4 August 1755, aged sixty-one, was buried with him. Their son James Bartholomew Radcliffe (1725&#150;1786) became third earl of Newburgh and was granted &pound;30,000 from the Derwentwater estates; his son Anthony James (1757&#150;1814), the fourth earl, died without issue and the earldom devolved upon the descendants of Thomas Clifford.<br>
