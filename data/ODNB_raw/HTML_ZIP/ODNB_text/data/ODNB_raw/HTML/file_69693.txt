<span class="headword">Parkinson,  Henry Thomas</span>  (1852&#150;1924), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and social scientist</span>, was born on 30 January 1852 at Cheadle, Staffordshire, the son of Henry Parkinson, a barber, and his wife, Isabella Millward. He went to Sedgley Park School, Staffordshire, in 1865 and then in 1868 to Douai in France, where he began his ecclesiastical studies, which he continued in 1873 at St Bernard's, Olton, the Birmingham diocesan seminary. In 1874 he proceeded to the English College, Rome, and was ordained priest on 26 May 1877, obtaining a doctorate in divinity at the Gregorian University. On completing his studies he returned to Olton as vice-rector and professor of philosophy. After ten years in this post, in 1887, he had his first and only taste of work in a parish, but it was at St Chad's Cathedral in Birmingham and it gave him an insight into the life of the poor in an industrial city.<br>
<br>When, in 1889, St Mary's College, Oscott, ceased to be a school for lay boys and became exclusively a seminary for the training of future priests Parkinson became professor of philosophy and vice-rector to Bishop Ilsley. He was to spend the rest of his life at Oscott but these thirty-five years were to witness a remarkable development. Although his family background and education might be considered very traditional, if not parochial, he became increasingly aware of a wider context. In 1897 Oscott became a central seminary for the whole of the south of England and this prompted Parkinson to think at a national level. His aims were broadened and he set out not only to make the outside world known to his students but also to make the outside world aware of Oscott and the English Roman Catholic tradition. It was a time when the University of Birmingham was in its beginnings and his interest in the relationship of science to religion led him to make contacts not only with fellow religionists like Sir Bertram Windle but other leading lights including Sir Oliver Lodge. They not only visited Oscott but they considered the possibility of students of the college attending some of the courses at the university.<br>
<br>In his own studies Parkinson never lost touch with the official views of Rome and he was always prepared to adapt to any change at the top level even to the extent of forsaking some of the ideas he had imbibed as a student when they fell out of favour in Rome. When the Central Seminary collapsed in 1907 and Oscott reverted to being mainly a diocesan seminary Parkinson did not lose his breadth of vision. Interest in social matters and the effects of the industrial revolution had been the concern of many Christians throughout the previous century but Parkinson was responsible for awakening the conscience of English Roman Catholics who were lagging behind their co-religionists on the continent in these matters. He gave a regular course of lectures at Oscott on social study and incorporated it into the ethics section of the philosophy course. He was particularly attentive to Pope Leo XIII's encyclical <span class="roman">Rerum novarum</span> and he promoted the study of papal teaching on the condition of the working classes among the laity at parish level. When the Catholic Social Guild was founded in 1909 Parkinson became its first president and later he was patron when a Catholic labour college was founded at Oxford in 1921. This was to develop into the Catholic Workers' College and eventually Plater College.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Primer of Social Science</span> was published in 1913; it proved to be popular and was reprinted several times after Parkinson's death. He was not only associated with international Catholic conferences and meetings abroad, in Belgium and France, but he addressed public meetings at home. In 1909&#150;10 he spoke in Birmingham on behalf of the national committee for the prevention of destitution at a meeting chaired by Henry Russell Wakefield, later the Anglican bishop of Birmingham, and he corresponded and shared platforms in Leeds and London with Sydney and Beatrice Webb. He also wrote pamphlets concerning poor law reform. He continued to attend to his duties as professor of philosophy and rector of Oscott, publishing, in Bruges, two works in Latin: <span class="italic">Definitiones philosophiae universae</span> (1894), a glossary of philosophical terms, and <span class="italic">Refectio spiritualis</span> (1906), a two-volume collection of meditations. He had great musical gifts and personally took charge of the college music and liturgy. He was a member of the reviewing staff of <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> and accepted an invitation from the Catholic University of America to contribute articles to the <span class="italic">Catholic Encyclopedia</span>.<br>
<br>Parkinson was able to get through an immense amount of work by reason of his strict daily timetable from which he rarely deviated. He had a strong sense of duty. Although he was not an original thinker, he was able to transmit the benefits of his experience and wide reading to his students and the growing number of laity who were taking an interest in social matters. He remained active up to the end. Parkinson was taken ill, removed to hospital, and operated on for peritonitis, but died on 22 June 1924 at Woodlea Nursing Home, Wylde Green, Birmingham. He was buried in the cemetery at Oscott College three days later.<br>
