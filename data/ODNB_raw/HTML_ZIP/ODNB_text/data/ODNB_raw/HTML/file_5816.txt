<span class="headword">Coggeshall,  Ralph  of</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1207&#150;1226), <span class="occ">historian and abbot of Coggeshall</span>, was a monk of the Cistercian abbey of Coggeshall, Essex. Abbot from 1207 until his resignation, because of illness, in 1218, he was the major contributor to, and may have been the sole author of, the Coggeshall chronicle known as the <span class="italic">Chronicon Anglicanum</span>. The precise extent of Ralph of Coggeshall's role in compiling the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> is difficult to determine because the text's earliest surviving manuscript, BL, Cotton MS Vespasian D.x, contains several changes of hand and ink, which may indicate that Ralph of Coggeshall was only one of several annalists who worked on the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span>, but may alternatively be evidence that Ralph of Coggeshall merely employed a number of scribes to copy an autograph for which he was entirely responsible.<br>
<br>Certain significant conclusions in relation to the nature of Coggeshall's contribution to the writing of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> can, however, be reached despite such ambiguous indications. Pronounced stylistic parallels between the annals from 1187 to 1206 and those from 1213 to 1224, do, for instance, strongly suggest that these two sections of the text, which are, in fact, the major parts of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span>, are the work of Ralph of Coggeshall who, as the text itself relates, &#145;wrote his chronicle from the capture of the Holy Cross&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicon Anglicanum</span>, 162&#150;3). The existence of such robust evidence more than compensates for the impossibility of determining the extent of Ralph of Coggeshall's involvement in the compilation of two other, more skeletal, sections of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span>, of which the first covers the period from 1066 to 1186 with annals which have presumably been inserted, <i>en bloc</i>, in order to preface Ralph of Coggeshall's coverage of later events, while the second covers the period from 1206 to 1212 with annals which seem to have been added, shortly after 1212, in order to make up for the loss of an earlier text. In the thirty or forty years to 1226, therefore, Ralph of Coggeshall was responsible for at least two sets of highly detailed annals which were compiled more or less contemporaneously with the events that they describe, and which may, since there is some evidence of an earlier recension of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span>'s annals to 1195, have been subject to subsequent revision by their author.<br>
<br>Ralph of Coggeshall was not an innovative historian, since his <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> is, in terms of its structure, no more than a traditional set of monastic annals, in which he is content to refer to a standard cyclical view of history to treat the unexpected demise of a king as God's punishment for uncorrected sins, and the death of an archbishop as an <i>exemplum</i> of the transitory nature of earthly achievement. The annalist's writing is, however, remarkable because of the way in which he deploys his considerable narrative skills to enliven his <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> with striking descriptions, based usually on oral rather than written evidence, of such exotic Suffolk phenomena as the two green children of Woolpit and the merman of Orford, and of such dramatic incidents as the capture of Richard I by Leopold, duke of Austria, in 1192, and the hurricane at Newark which marked the death of John on the night of 18 October 1216.<br>
<br>Three early texts of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span> are extant. That in Cotton MS Vespasian D.x may be, in part, an autograph. The nearly contemporary copies in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris (MS Lat. 15076), and the College of Arms, London (MS 11), are closely related to this earliest surviving version of the text. Certain commentators have argued that Ralph of Coggeshall was the author not only of the <span class="italic">Chronicon</span>, but also of the <span class="italic">Libellus de expugnatione Sanctae Terrae</span> and of a set of annals from 1162 to 1178 which were added to the work of Ralph Niger. It is evident, however, that neither text can be ascribed to him.<br>
