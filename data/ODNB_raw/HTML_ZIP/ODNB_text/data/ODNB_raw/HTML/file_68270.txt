<span class="headword">Philp <span class="st"> [Philip]</span>,  James, of Almerieclose</span>  (1654/5&#150;1714<span class="mult">x</span>25), <span class="occ">Jacobite poet</span>, was born at Arbroath, Forfarshire, the son of James Philp of Almerieclose (<i>d</i>. 1695/6), &#145;a small property &hellip; composed of several crofts and bits of lands &hellip; gathered round the old Almonry premises of the ruined Abbey&#146; of Arbroath  (Philp, &#145;Introduction&#146;), and Margaret Grahame (<i>fl</i>. 1635&#150;1675), the daughter of Walter Grahame of Duntrune and a second cousin of John Grahame of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee.<br>
<br>Philp, a member of a strongly royalist and episcopalian family, was educated at Arbroath grammar school and at the University of St Andrews (1672&#150;5); he may subsequently have studied law at Edinburgh, where he was certainly staying in the late 1670s. In 1684 or 1685 Philp married Jean Corbit (<i>fl</i>. 1660&#150;1700), daughter of John Corbit of Tollcrosse, Glasgow. They had two sons, James (<i>d</i>. 1734) and John (<i>d</i>. 1752), who became governor of St Martin's in America. Both sons succeeded Philp as laird. On 16 April 1689 Philp joined Viscount Dundee at the raising of the standard of King James on Dundee law: only fifty were present. Philp acted as the standard-bearer to the Jacobite army in the ensuing campaign, but more importantly he also gathered material for what was to be the last major attempt at a Latin epic written in the British Isles, the <span class="italic">Grameid</span>, probably composed in the years either side of 1700. It is influenced both by Virgil, whose <span class="italic">Aeneid</span> was a major source of Jacobite code until 1750, and by Lucan, possibly in tribute to the fact that the <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span> had been a favourite book of the marquess of Montrose, to whom Philp was related on his mother's side.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Grameid</span> is not only a useful source for details of the rising of 1689, but also an important piece of literature in its own right. Emphasizing &#145;Lucanian darkness and violence as a counterbalance to its Virgilian promise of hope and restoration&#146;  (Pittock, 40), Philp thematizes both Scottish and British foundation myths, and he is also perhaps the first Jacobite writer to use the image of the highlander as a synecdoche for true Scottish patriotism. The idea of the selling of nationality for &#145;Dutch gold&#146;  (ibid., 42), that was so prominent in later accounts of the Union also makes an early appearance in this poem. The <span class="italic">Grameid</span> is a significant achievement in Scottish literature which would be far better recognized were it not written in Latin.<br>
<br>Philp did not apparently suffer directly for his Jacobitism, although he was accused at the burgh court of Arbroath of abusing the town's Williamite magistrates in 1692. In 1695 or 1696 he succeeded his father as laird of Almerieclose; he died, probably in Arbroath, some time between 1714 and 1725. The manuscript of his poem was deposited in the Advocates' Library either at his death or shortly thereafter. In 1888 it was published by the Revd Alexander Murdoch for the Scottish History Society.<br>
