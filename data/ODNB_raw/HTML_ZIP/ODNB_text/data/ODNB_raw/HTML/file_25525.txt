<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sidney,  Robert</span>, second earl of Leicester  (1595&#150;1677), <span class="occ">diplomat and landowner</span>, was born on 1 December 1595 at Baynard's Castle, London, the youngest but only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25524/', "Robert Sidney, first earl of Leicester (1563&#150;1626)")</script>, and his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67993/', "Barbara Sidney, n&#233;e Gamage (c.1559&#150;1621)")</script>, daughter of John Gamage of Coety, Glamorgan. When he was baptized at the end of the month his godparents were Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, Lord William Compton (later earl of Northampton), and Penelope, Lady Rich.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife15951632"></a>Early life, 1595&#150;1632</h2>With his older brother William (<i>d</i>. 1612), Sidney matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 February 1607; he was still at Oxford in October 1610. William was knighted in January 1610 but Robert received the higher honour of a knighthood of the Bath the following June; the same year his father, who was governor of Flushing, one of the English cautionary towns in the Netherlands, made Robert captain of a foot company there. Robert visited Flushing in 1613 but was back in England the following year when he was MP for Wilton (one of the boroughs of his cousin the earl of Pembroke) in the Addled Parliament; he was appointed to a few committees but appears to have been relatively inactive. Perhaps rebelling against his father's attempts to marry him off (at least two engagements were proposed for him in 1613), in 1615 he secretly married Lady Dorothy Percy (<i>bap</i>. 1598, <i>d</i>. 1659), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland (1564&#150;1632)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Dorothy Devereux, daughter of the earl of Essex. Their eldest child, Dorothy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26120/', "Spencer, Dorothy, countess of Sunderland")</script>], was born in October 1617. The marriage, which was not discovered until a year later, linked Sidney with two of the most powerful noble families in the realm, and the Percy connection in particular was to be an abiding influence on his career. It was probably the marriage that led to a bitter quarrel between Sidney and James Hay, Viscount Doncaster, who had married Dorothy's sister Lucy Percy, in the course of which the two men came to blows in 1620.<br>
<br>When in the spring of 1616 Flushing and Brill were restored to the United Provinces their English garrisons were reconstituted into a regiment under Sidney's command and retained in Dutch service. He visited the Low Countries later that year and journeyed on to Paris; he was again with his regiment in 1620&#150;21 and retained the command into the 1640s, but latterly it was principally a pecuniary interest. He was admitted to Gray's Inn on 25 February 1618 and when, in the August of that year, his father was made earl of Leicester, he was henceforth styled Viscount L'Isle. In the 1621 parliament he was MP for Kent and in those of 1624 and 1625 sat for Monmouthshire, but he left only a minor mark in the records. On his father's death on 13 July 1626 he succeeded as second earl of Leicester.<h2>
<a name="EmbassytoDenmark1632"></a>Embassy to Denmark, 1632</h2>In April 1632 Charles I announced Leicester's appointment as ambassador-extraordinary to Christian IV of Denmark. The ostensible and public purpose was to offer condolences on the death the previous year of Charles's maternal grandmother, Queen Sophia Frederica; the secret aim of the mission was to stir Christian to action in the Thirty Years' War and to see how Denmark stood in relation to Sweden's proposed anti-Habsburg league. Leicester left for Denmark on 15 September 1632 with a retinue of fifty-five including, as his secretary, James Howell, and had his first audience with the Danish king on 1 October. Leicester was struck by Danish customs, especially the debauchery of the court, noting in his journal that Christian led &#145;a strange life &hellip; drunk every day, lying with a whore every night&#146;, but he showed that he could hold his own in the mammoth drinking binges that passed for royal entertainment in Denmark. At the feast marking the end of Leicester's short embassy on 15 October, which stretched from 11 a.m. until evening, the earl proudly noted that after thirty-five toasts he could still manage stairs unassisted, while the king had to be carried from the table in his chair. Outdrinking the Danes was, perhaps, Leicester's principal achievement on the embassy, for he achieved little else, apart from some minor trading concessions. He returned via Hamburg and reached England on 2 November 1632. Only a few days later all his negotiations were overtaken, and the whole European situation was altered, by the death of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden at the battle of L&uuml;tzen.<h2>
<a name="EmbassytoFrance16361641"></a>Embassy to France, 1636&#150;1641</h2>Leicester's family traditions (his uncle had been Sir Philip Sidney) and his Dutch command inclined him to support a policy of vigorously pursuing the protestant interest in the Thirty Years' War, while his Percy connections tied him to the circle of Queen Henrietta Maria in the mid-1630s, a time when her court briefly represented a &#145;puritan&#146; clique pushing for war with Spain. He professed himself the queen's &#145;Slave&#146;  (Collins, 2.387) and, with her influence over affairs growing, in April 1636 Henrietta Maria procured Leicester's appointment as ambassador-extraordinary to France, seconding the mission of the ambassador-in-ordinary, Viscount Scudamore, whose negotiations with the French had proved unsuccessful. Leicester arrived in Paris on 3 June 1636 (<span class="smallcap">NS</span>) and promptly fell out with Scudamore. The two men could agree on nothing: they employed different solicitors and different agents, they took contrary positions in many diplomatic questions, and they even went to different church services, Scudamore worshipping in his own chapel, Leicester attending the services of the French Reformed church at Charenton in a gesture of solidarity with Huguenots and in defiance of the predilections of Charles and Archbishop William Laud. Leicester successfully ridiculed Scudamore and undermined his credit at the English court, while his own reputation was safeguarded by the strenuous efforts of the earls of Northumberland and Holland, Henry Percy, and the countess of Leicester, who remained in England. Behind these differences lay a deeper division over policy. While Scudamore inclined to a pro-Spanish neutrality, Leicester agitated actively for an Anglo-French alliance against the Habsburgs, telling the secretary of state, Sir John Coke, that &#145;nothing can be more glorious, nor more religious in the sight of God and man then such a war&#146; against Spain  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/101, fol. 400). When Charles preferred to pursue a negotiated settlement Leicester reiterated his belief that &#145;the diseases of Christendome are not to be cured like the King's evil with touching, but with striking&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/102, fol. 279). Throughout 1636 Leicester frequently twisted and even ignored his diplomatic instructions in an attempt to persuade Charles and Louis XIII into an alliance. While his words and actions caused some consternation in England, in December 1636 the king showed his support for him against Scudamore by raising his allowance to unprecedented heights.<br>
<br>When the principal negotiations between England and France were remitted to a proposed peace conference at Hamburg in 1637, the nature of Leicester's mission changed, as did the queen's circle, which saw renewed intrigues against Cardinal Richelieu. Leicester negotiated the change successfully. By August 1637 he was drawn into Charles's secret negotiations on behalf of Marie de' Medici's circle in Flanders. He was also implicated in the notorious La Porte affair, a conspiracy involving the exiled Marie de' Medici and her court in Brussels, and the French queen, Anne of Austria, and aiming both to overthrow Richelieu and frustrate the proposed Anglo-French treaty that Leicester had pressed so hard for only recently. Leicester's secretary, R&eacute;n&eacute; Augier, provided the means by which Anne's letters to the Habsburgs could be sent to the Spanish Netherlands. Leicester's negotiations were thwarted by the French, however, whose spies had penetrated the English court, who were intercepting Leicester's post, and who were almost certainly receiving information from Augier himself.<br>
<br>The earl was left with little purpose to his mission. He was temporarily recalled in February 1639, at the same time as Scudamore's mission was ended, but was sent back alone to France in August. The English government was entirely preoccupied by its Scottish and domestic troubles, and Leicester was instructed by Charles in the spring of 1639 to &#145;mesnage the proceedings by such degrees, that you cum to no conclusion til wee bee freed from our trobles at home&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/107, fol. 154<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>From August 1637 Leicester had been scheming to be recalled to England and to be made secretary in place of Coke. Two years later an alternative was suggested by Northumberland, that he should succeed Thomas Wentworth, Viscount Wentworth, as lord deputy of Ireland. He was constantly frustrated. Although he was sworn a privy councillor on 5 May 1639, further preferment was blocked by Laud, who opposed Leicester on account of the earl's treatment of his friend Scudamore. Laud represented Leicester to the king as a puritan, an accusation which Leicester strenuously denied. The earl's preferment of Henry Hammond to the living of Penshurst, the Sidneys' seat, in 1633, after hearing him preach at court, does not suggest any radical religious leanings.<br>
<br>The fall of Strafford created the opportunity, the fall of Laud removed the obstacle; Leicester was again recalled to England in May 1641, and on 14 June 1641 he was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland. He returned to France in August to conclude his embassy, and arrived back in England at the beginning of October.<h2>
<a name="LordlieutenantofIrelandandtheEnglishcivilwar16411644"></a>Lord lieutenant of Ireland and the English civil war, 1641&#150;1644</h2>Leicester was thus ready to take up his commission just as the Irish rising broke out, preventing his travelling to Dublin. The next three years were the most testing of his life. The appointment which he had sought, and which Charles had hoped would placate some of his godly opponents in parliament, succeeded in satisfying no one. As Leicester later rued, &#145;that which should have bin for my good became unto me an occasion of falling&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 6.555). Although he sent his sons <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25523/', "Philip Sidney (1619&#150;1698)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25519/', "Algernon Sidney (1623&#150;1683)")</script> to Ireland in April 1642 with 600 horse, he never managed to get there himself. Leicester was caught between king and parliament as they argued and divided over who should control the army sent to crush the Irish rebels. The lord lieutenant's position was probably impossible. For Leicester, who according to the earl of Clarendon was &#145;rather a speculative than a practical man&#146;, and who &#145;expected a greater certitude in the consultation of business than the business of the world is capable of&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.531), it proved personally disastrous.<br>
<br>None the less, Leicester retained the confidence of the Lords until the summer of 1642, acting as temporary speaker of the house in May and June, and appointed parliament's lord lieutenant for Kent. As England drifted into civil war, however, he was unable to choose between the two sides and irresolutely sought to satisfy both. He repeatedly refused to grant commissions to his deputy lieutenants under the militia ordinance, stymying efforts to raise Kent for parliament until he was replaced in mid-August 1642. That month he bewailed his plight to the countess of Carlisle, his sister-in-law:<blockquote>I am environed by such contradictions, as I can neither get from them, nor reconcile them. The Parliament bids me go presently; the King commands me to stay till he dispatch me. The supplyes of the one, and the authority of the other, are equally necessary. I know not how to obtain them both, and am more likely to have neither; for now they are at such extremes, as to please the one is scarce possible, unless the other be opposed &hellip; I am suspected and distrusted of either side. (Blencowe, xxi&#150;xxii)</blockquote>When parliament insisted on seeing his instructions from the king, Leicester initially refused, increasing the suspicions by then harboured by many in the Commons and the Lords about his intentions, but in October 1642 he yielded, so incurring the king's displeasure. In late November, with Leicester in Chester on the point of embarking for Dublin, Charles, preferring to use Ormond, whose loyalty he did not doubt, forbade him to go and summoned him to Oxford where he arrived shortly after Christmas.<br>
<br>Leicester passed the next year in the royalist headquarters in a tortured state, declining to take any part in the king's affairs. Penshurst was sequestered by the Kent county committee on the grounds that Leicester had flown to an enemy garrison, but the countess, probably with the help of Northumberland, one of the most influential parliamentarian peers, persuaded the parliament to lift the sequestration. In November 1643 the king induced Leicester to resign the lord lieutenancy so that he could appoint Ormond in his place. Leicester remained in Oxford, expecting that he would be appointed governor to Prince Charles. His refusal in January 1644 to sign the letter from the English peers at Oxford to the Scottish privy council urging them not to support the covenanters' invasion of England, however, lost him all hope of preferment, and in June 1644 he left Oxford to make his peace with parliament before retiring to Penshurst, where he attempted to sit out the war quietly, declining to seek readmission to the House of Lords.<h2>
<a name="Retirementandlaterlife16441677"></a>Retirement and later life, 1644&#150;1677</h2>Leicester was a broken man and spent almost all of his remaining three decades in retirement at Penshurst, occasionally visiting his London residence, Leicester House, and concerning himself with his estates and scholarly pursuits. Clarendon described him as &#145;very conversant in books, and much addicted to the mathematics&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.531). He possessed a large library, valued at &pound;100 at his death, and his reading concentrated on the politics, religion, customs, and history of ancient and modern nations of the world. Many of his notes and reflections from these survive, and show that he could write interchangeably in five languages (English, Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian). His son Algernon later claimed that Leicester &#145;writ his own mind to see what he could think of it another time, and blot it out again may be&#146;  (Scott, 56). His studies tended towards the relativism and scepticism fashionable in the intellectual circles he had encountered in Paris, where he also met, and clearly admired, Hugo Grotius, the exiled Dutch philosopher who was ambassador of Queen Kristina of Sweden. Leicester was much preoccupied with &#145;the opinions and fancyes of men&#146;  (Scott, 55) and differing political and legal customs. While such relativist thoughts encouraged some, notably his son Algernon, towards radical politics and republicanism, in Leicester they reinforced his tendency towards indecision, what Clarendon called &#145;the staggering and irresolution in his nature&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 2.531).<br>
<br>Although two of his sons&#151;Philip, Lord Lisle, and Algernon&#151;served the regimes of the interregnum in various capacities, Leicester refused to have much to do with the Commonwealth or protectorate. The countess was, however, through the influence of her brother Northumberland, given the care of two of the late king's children in May 1649. The duke of Gloucester and Princess Elizabeth lived at Penshurst from 14 June 1649 to 9 August 1650, when they were removed from the countess's care and sent to Carisbrooke Castle by the council of state. The earl took the engagement on 18 April 1650, but only because &#145;if I had not don so I could not have bin plaintiffe nor have sued in any Court of Justice upon what occasion soever&#146;  (<span class="italic">De L'Isle and Dudley MSS</span>, 6.598). He had, indeed, a stack of suits to prosecute and defend, concerning both his own estate and that of his nephew, Philip Smythe, Viscount Strangford, whose wardship he reluctantly took on in December 1649 after the death of Strangford's former guardian, Sir Thomas Fotherly. He even more reluctantly agreed the following August to the marriage of his daughter Isabella to Strangford, a union pressed on him by the couple and his wife. Strangford, however, was an easily misled drunkard and his affairs were hopelessly chaotic. Strangford initially accused Fotherly of embezzlement and launched a legal suit against the family which Leicester had to prosecute, before, in 1653, revoking Leicester's title to his guardianship and pursuing the Sidneys through the courts on the same charge of embezzlement. A further case concerned a diamond that Princess Elizabeth, who had died shortly after her removal to Carisbrooke, had bequeathed to the countess of Leicester. Long proceedings ensued, the trustees for the sale of the goods of king and queen claiming that they belonged to the state, the Sidneys basing their title on the princess's personal ownership of the jewel, as originally a gift from her brother-in-law the prince of Orange.<br>
<br>Leicester employed his second son, Algernon, as his principal assistant and agent in the management of his estate and legal affairs from 1648 to 1659. The earl's preference for the able Algernon in preference to his dull and indolent elder brother, Philip, caused a permanent estrangement between the father and his heir. In December 1652 Philip struck his father in the face and proclaimed himself discharged of all duty towards him; three and a half years later Philip complained that the earl allowed Algernon to domineer and command at Penshurst. Two decades later, when the earl's attempts to develop his London property at Leicester Fields had led him into further legal difficulties, it was Algernon's support and advice he sought, procuring a pass for Algernon, in exile on the continent since the Restoration, to return to England. Algernon, however, did not return until after his father's death.<br>
<br>In April 1660 Leicester took up his seat in the House of Lords. Charles II made him a privy councillor on 31 May 1660, but in October 1660, after the adjournment of the parliament, he obtained the king's permission to retire to Penshurst on the grounds of ill health. On the same grounds his attendance at the coronation in April 1661 was also dispensed with. The countess's death on 20 August 1659 had prompted the earl to announce his own imminent end, but he went on to enjoy a further eighteen years of ill health, obsessively writing and rewriting codicils to his will to exclude his son Philip from the estate and control the portions of his other children according to their current standing in his affections. He died at Penshurst on 2 November 1677 and was buried there six days later.<br>
