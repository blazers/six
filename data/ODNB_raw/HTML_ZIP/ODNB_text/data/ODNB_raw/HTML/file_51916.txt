<span class="headword">Fisher,  Max Henry <span class="st"> [Fredy]</span></span>  (1922&#150;1993), <span class="occ">journalist and merchant banker</span>, was born on 30 May 1922 at Fasanenstrasse, Berlin, Germany, the only child of Dr Friedrich (Fritz) Fischer (1888&#150;1971) and his wife, Sophia (Sonia), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bakst (1897&#150;1965). His parents both belonged to assimilated Jewish families. His father was a successful lawyer, and a fine pianist, from Upper Silesia, his mother a Russian from Lithuania. He was registered as Max Hermann Fischer and later wrote as M. H. Fisher, but was invariably known as Fredy. His parents separated in 1922 and divorced in 1928. Marie Gunderman, Fredy's governess from 1929, made him bilingual in French, and with Thekla, the family maid, provided any stability in his childhood. He attended the Fichte Gymnasium in Berlin from 1932 to 1935, but in January 1936, after his father had to leave Germany, Fisher was sent to Rendcomb College, Gloucestershire. There he demonstrated his extraordinary force of character. He knew no English and had been suddenly switched from an intensely cultured German home to cold baths and muscular Christianity. Yet by 1940 the school expected him to win an Oxford history scholarship and he had developed a lifelong (non-playing) enthusiasm for cricket. Although he had come to admire the language of Cranmer's prayer book and the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span> he remained, as always, without religious belief.<br>
<br>In May 1940 this assimilated English schoolboy was detained as an enemy alien. After eighteen months, first in England, then in Australia, Fisher volunteered for the Pioneer Corps. Permitted in 1943 to prepare for active service, he joined the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, a tank regiment, as a trooper. The army Anglicized his name to Fisher for security reasons but he insisted on an identity disc that marked him as a Jew. Passed over for a commission, he became a wireless operator driver. His squadron took part in the Normandy landings of June 1944, was in the forefront of the advance through France, suffered very heavy casualties, and eventually reached Berlin.<br>
<br>Fisher's ambition was to become an Oxford historian. In 1946, after an exhilarating year as a sergeant interpreter and investigator for the military police in Germany, he went up to Lincoln College, Oxford. In 1948 he took a first-class degree in modern history, and planned that his historical research would rescue the eighteenth-century duke of Newcastle from Namier's deconstruction. This would have seen two outsiders, who both loved England, debating a wonderfully English theme. But Fisher needed an income, and no Oxford post materialized, so in 1949 he joined an official tripartite team, based at Bletchley, editing captured German foreign ministry documents. He worked on this task until 1956. With his American colleague Norman Rich he also edited and translated <span class="italic">The Holstein Papers</span> in four classic volumes (1955&#150;63).<br>
<br>Fisher's academic ambitions now halted. He was a visiting lecturer at Melbourne University in 1956&#150;7, but returned to Britain wanting to become a journalist. He had an introduction to the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, and suddenly Fisher's linguistic and intellectual gifts, his combined continental and British background, and his personal ambition all found their perfect outlet. With the help of several other brilliant recruits, such as Nigel Lawson and William Rees-Mogg, the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> was being turned by Gordon Newton into a national newspaper. Fisher made it also an international newspaper, as foreign editor (1961), deputy editor (1971), and editor (1973&#150;80).<br>
<br>Fisher was an ebullient, tireless, and sometimes irascible editor. He led the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> from the top. He became a confidant of successive political leaders and may have hoped for a more official role. He strongly advocated European unification, with British participation, and was responsible for launching the paper's Frankfurt edition. However, the 1970s were a period of constant economic crisis, and the paper's circulation and profits declined. There were a variety of serious management tensions. By 1980 Fisher felt he had made his contribution to the paper and was ready for a new career. The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> he joined in 1957 had been transformed, and to a considerable extent by Fisher's own talents.<br>
<br>In 1981 Fisher joined S. G. Warburgs, the merchant bank, and until 1993 was an executive director, particularly involved with its advisory work in Germany. He was also a director of Commercial Union Assurance (1981&#150;91) and of Booker McConnell, later Booker plc (1981&#150;93), and was a governor of the London School of Economics (1981&#150;93).<br>
<br>Fisher was wholehearted in everything he did. He had a great love and knowledge of classical music, especially opera. He read widely, enjoyed golf, and was an outstanding bridge player. On 23 February 1952 he married Rosemary Margaret 
    (Ro; <i>b</i>. 1929)
  , sculptor, daughter of Dr L. A. I. and Lilias Charlotte Maxwell, of Melbourne, Australia. They had two sons and a daughter. Devotion to his marriage was central to his life. Fisher died of ischaemic heart disease at his home, 16 Somerset Square, London, on 29 August 1993, after some years of ill health. He was cremated at Cambridge on 8 September. There was a memorial celebration on 21 October 1993 at St John's, Smith Square, London, including readings of Goethe's &#145;Auss&ouml;hnung&#146; and Newbolt's &#145;Vitai lampada&#146;, with the performance of Schubert's <span class="roman">Quartettsatz in C minor</span>, which Fisher had requested.<br>
