<span class="headword">Gandhi <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Nehru]</span>,  Indira Priyadarshini</span>  (1917&#150;1984), <span class="occ">prime minister of India</span>, was born on 19 November 1917 at Allahabad, United Provinces, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35191/', "Jawaharlal Nehru (1889&#150;1964)")</script>, one of the principal leaders of the Indian nationalist movement and India's first prime minister, and Kamala (<i>c</i>.1899&#150;1936), daughter of Atal Kaul, a businessman of Delhi. Both her parents were Kashmiri Brahmans. Indira was an only child, brought up in the wealthy, Westernized, politicized, and bustling household of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35192/', "Motilal Nehru")</script>, her grandfather, one of the most prominent lawyers of the province.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandeducation"></a>Childhood and education</h2>Three generations of the Nehru family, several aunts, and many family retainers and political activists resided in or engaged in political work in the grand family residence, known as Anand Bhavan (&#145;Happy Home&#146;). Indira was a favoured child in this household, though she recalled unkind treatment and devastating remarks about her made by her aunt <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47741/', "Vijayalakshmi Pandit")</script>, whom she never forgave. Moreover, in the midst of this bustle of family and political activity Indira was often alone and lonely, especially during the periods of intense nationalist activity, when many of her family, including at times both her mother and father, were in gaol.<br>
<br>Long and frequent periods of separation from one or both parents and prolonged travel and residence away from home contributed to the development of several of Indira's characteristic personality traits: a strong sense of self-reliance and personal responsibility for her own fate, those of others, and later the country; personal courage; mistrust of others and detachment, manifested in a lifelong inability to maintain close relationships with people other than her nearest family members; the frequent use of silence in her private and public relations as a means of obtaining her wishes, and of withdrawing from conflict temporarily in order to bide her time for later action; a tendency to blame others for difficulties and misfortunes; a determination in the face of a perceived hostile world to prevail nevertheless against all odds in the attainment of her goals. A gangly child, she became in maturity an attractive woman, who carried herself with great poise and dignity.<br>
<br>Although Indira was often with her father and from her twenties onward became his personal confidante and hostess, she was closer in her formative years to her mother. The disparate character and lives of her father and mother, the former a thoroughly Westernized and modern man, an agnostic, and an intellectual, the latter a simple, traditional, and religious woman, were reflected also in their daughter's personal and private views on life. Publicly she projected her father's outlook, privately her mother's faith.<br>
<br>Indira's formal education was obtained at numerous schools and universities in India and abroad, including the &Eacute;cole Nouvelle at Bex in Switzerland, St Mary's Convent School in Allahabad, the Pupil's Own School in Poona, Rabindranath Tagore's Visva-Bharati University at Santiniketan, Badminton School near Bristol, and finally Somerville College, Oxford. Her education at most of these places was interrupted by travel with her father, her own discontent, and at Oxford by academic failure. Although she became proficient in French, she was otherwise an indifferent student.<br>
<br>Contrary to social custom and against her father's wishes, Indira married on 16 March 1942 Feroze Gandhi, a Parsi, who had for long been a part of the Nehru household and a trusted intimate of her mother. Although Indira and Feroze became estranged from each other within a few years and she spent more and more time with her father while Feroze spent more time with other women, they had two children, Rajiv, born on 20 August 1944, and Sanjay, born on 14 December 1946. Feroze died in 1959, after which Indira remained a widow, though there were at times unconfirmed rumours of liaisons with other men.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer"></a>Early political career</h2>Indira Gandhi was, of course, a dedicated nationalist, who had seen her parents and other relations move in and out of gaol in pursuit of the goal of Indian independence and who had herself spent nine months in gaol in 1942&#150;3. She was also in her soul a political person, deeply involved in &#145;power politics&#146; and committed to the attainment of specific goals, though without the overall vision of a new society which guided her father. From her youth she demonstrated an abiding interest in activities and programmes for the benefit of children, the low castes, and the poor, which was ultimately reflected in concrete policies for these groups when she came to power.<br>
<br>However, the most dramatic and consequential actions in Mrs Gandhi's political career arose primarily out of political combat and international conflict. Of these, the first in a long series occurred when she was elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1959, while her father was prime minister. Initially against her father's wishes, she helped instigate a protest movement in the state of Kerala against policies of a duly elected communist government with a majority in the legislature, then used that movement as a pretext for actions&#151;legal in form, but against the constitution in spirit, and deceptive in practice&#151;which led to the dismissal of the government and the establishment of president's rule (rule by the central government) in the state.<br>
<br>Indira Gandhi was passed over in the succession to her father in 1964, which was handled by a group of state party bosses known as the syndicate, who chose instead Lal Bahadur Shastri as Nehru's successor. Inducted into Shastri's cabinet as minister for information and broadcasting, a relatively minor portfolio, she made little mark or impression. Even when she was chosen as prime minister in January 1966 to replace Lal Bahadur after his sudden death in Tashkent, it was not because of her achievements or her political support, but because the still politically dominant syndicate members saw her as a manageable person whose selection would prevent the ascendance of Morarji Desai, perceived as a dangerous and unmanageable rival to them. Nor did she display at first any of the self-assurance and political skill for which she later became famous.<h2>
<a name="Primeminister"></a>Prime minister</h2>Mrs Gandhi's dynamism, combativeness, and assertiveness only became evident when she began to feel threatened by fears that the syndicate was trying to control her and then displace her from power, and by the disastrous results of the first general elections held while she was prime minister, in 1967, during which the Congress failed for the first time to win a two-thirds majority in parliament, and in the aftermath of which the Congress lost power in half the Indian states. Her first decisive act came in the midst of these dangers in 1969, when the president of India died in office. Fearing the election as president of a man chosen by the syndicate, she defied her own party, lobbied for another candidate, who succeeded as a consequence of her efforts, and was expelled from the Congress. In the midst of this conflict she became head of a rival Congress, which ultimately became in effect her party, called the Indian National Congress (Indira), or for short the Congress (I).<br>
<br>In national elections called at her request in 1971 Indira's Congress prevailed against the syndicate-dominated Congress with a two-thirds majority in parliament. In the March 1972 state legislative assembly elections which followed, the Congress (I) again emerged triumphant, winning large majorities in all the larger states of the union, establishing definitively her personal political dominance and that of her party in the country.<br>
<br>In the midst of the internal struggle to establish her power base India and Indira had to face the consequences of the civil war in Pakistan between the East and West wings, which led to an influx of an estimated 9 to 10 million refugees from the East wing. Failing to win support from Western countries to force a peaceful settlement of the struggle on Pakistan and the return of the refugees, she turned to the Soviet Union, signing a treaty of peace, friendship, and co-operation in August 1971 with the understanding that its terms implied Soviet support to prevent US involvement in opposition to any Indian action against Pakistan. In December 1971 India invaded East Pakistan, defeated the Pakistan army there, and thereby brought independence to the new state of Bangladesh.<h2>
<a name="Consolidationofpower"></a>Consolidation of power</h2>Despite India's triumph in war under her leadership, and the massive character of the victory against all her rivals in the 1971&#150;2 elections, as well as the absence of significant opposition to her leadership in her own party, Mrs Gandhi never felt secure in power. She always felt threatened by both domestic and international forces, which she saw as bent on thwarting her policies and displacing her from power. She took numerous measures, therefore, to deal with what she perceived as the remaining opposition to her authority&#151;measures including challenges to the independence of the judiciary through judicial appointments, and the assertion of the supremacy of parliament over the supreme court, as well as the enactment of measures additional to the already extensive armoury of laws to control domestic dissent through preventive detention of persons without trial.<br>
<br>Mrs Gandhi also took measures to prevent the rise of strong opposition parties and to control dissent within her own party in the states through the use or threat of president's rule and by removing from the Congress state legislature parties the power to elect their leaders, whom she chose herself. Elections to party positions in the Indian National Congress itself were stopped, and all important party appointments and decisions were made directly by her or in her name by her closest advisers. Within the central government all cabinet ministers were either people without independent power bases or saw their power bases undermined while they served under her leadership. Increasingly, Mrs Gandhi took her own decisions independently of the cabinet, in consultation only with a shifting clique of high-level bureaucrats personally loyal to her, former retainers from the Nehru household, and her younger son, Sanjay.<h2>
<a name="Emergencyrule"></a>Emergency rule</h2>A few voices were raised from among the opposition parties and from some non-party figures contending that Mrs Gandhi was bent upon establishing personal, authoritarian rule in the country. Charges were also made that under her rule corruption, endemic in Indian politics, had become so massive as to constitute a qualitative change, including such matters as the buying and selling of the loyalty of members of the state legislatures to undermine opposition parties and the collection of large monetary contributions for the party coffers from state party leaders and businessmen. Domestic food shortages and price rises in 1973&#150;4 precipitated discontent in the states of Bihar and Gujarat, where popular movements were launched to displace the Congress from power. At this time also an old and highly respected nationalist leader, Jayaprakash Narayan, emerged from political retirement to take up the leadership of all the forces opposed to the authoritarian tendencies and the corruption which had been spreading under Mrs Gandhi's leadership.<br>
<br>An unexpected fillip was suddenly provided to the opposition to Mrs Gandhi when an election petition, filed in a local court and alleging the use of corrupt practices in her own election to parliament in 1971, succeeded in June 1975, and her election was declared invalid. Under the laws she would have been disbarred from contesting an election for six years, which would have terminated her position as prime minister and threatened her future political career. Mrs Gandhi responded, as always in the face of a major threat, by buying time through an appeal to the supreme court while she gathered the internal strength for decisive action. That action came on 25 June 1975 in the form of a declaration of emergency for the entire country, and the arrest of thousands of opposition leaders and activists and of hundreds of people from her own party, including Congress members of parliament and of the state legislatures. Complete press censorship was imposed, the laws under which her election was declared invalid were themselves invalidated, the powers of the prime minister's office were strengthened, the terms of the national parliament and of the state legislatures were extended, and the preventive detention laws were fortified further to nullify even the use of the right of habeas corpus in the courts.<br>
<br>During the succeeding two-and-a-half years of emergency rule Mrs Gandhi allowed her son <a name="cosubject_47744"></a><span class="headword">Sanjay Gandhi</span>  (1946&#150;1980), who held no elected position in government, to exercise power and authority in her name in relation to party members and government bureaucrats. He in turn recruited into the party thousands of younger people, many of them hooligans and ruffians, who used threats and force to intimidate rivals and those who opposed Mrs Gandhi's authority or his own. Many of Sanjay Gandhi's actions and those of his followers, as well as the zealousness of bureaucrats determined to prove their loyalty to the leaders of the new regime, produced popular discontent and fears, which lingered below the surface during the emergency rule. These measures included forced sterilizations of men as part of Sanjay Gandhi's family planning programme, destruction of squatter settlements in the cities, and the police firing on crowds which gathered to protest such actions.<h2>
<a name="Defeatandreelection"></a>Defeat and re-election</h2>When Mrs Gandhi decided to seek to legitimize her rule by releasing virtually all political prisoners and holding an election in January 1977, this discontent provided an important basis for her defeat by a new force, called the Janata Party, formed by most of the important opposition parties and leaders in the country. During the two-and-a-half years of Janata rule, most of the emergency laws and measures were rescinded and the basic features of the constitutional order were restored. Attempts to convict Mrs Gandhi and her son for illegal acts committed during the emergency foundered, as did the Janata government itself in July 1979, when, as a consequence of internal divisions and the efforts of Sanjay Gandhi, the Janata Party split, the government fell, and no new majority could be found in parliament. The failure of efforts to arrest and convict Mrs Gandhi, followed by the disintegration of the Janata Party, brought her public sympathy and renewed political support as she became seen as the political leader most likely to bring stability to the country.<h2>
<a name="Primeministeragainandassassination"></a>Prime minister again and assassination</h2>In an election called for January 1980 to replace the parliament Congress (I) prevailed and Mrs Gandhi again became India's prime minister. Most of the opposition-controlled state legislatures were soon dismissed and new state legislative assembly elections called, which restored the Congress to power in most of the states once again. Mrs Gandhi's gratification over her triumph was marred by personal tragedy in the sudden death of her favoured son and political heir apparent, Sanjay, in a plane crash on 23 June.<br>
<br>Mrs Gandhi governed for the next four years for the most part without resort to the extreme measures adopted during the emergency. However, her attempts to consolidate her power anew everywhere in the country led to interventions which precipitated turmoil in the north-east, in Kashmir, and in Punjab. The latter proved to be the most serious, where violent terrorist groups overshadowed the routine politics of the state, which had to be placed under president's rule. After the leader of the Sikh militants and his followers had taken refuge in the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the holiest site of the Sikh religion, Mrs Gandhi ultimately ordered the Indian army to launch an assault within the temple precincts to remove them, during which many hundreds of defenders, soldiers, and visitors to the shrine were killed. Far from settling the Punjab conflict, this action embittered virtually the entire Sikh population of the world and led to an insurrection which lasted for a decade thereafter. On 31 October 1984 Mrs Gandhi was assassinated by two of her own Sikh bodyguards in the garden of her residence in New Delhi. During her funeral in Delhi organized mobs took vengeance in the slaughter of thousands of Sikh residents. Her body was cremated near her father's and son's cremation sites at Raj Ghat in Delhi and her ashes were scattered by her surviving son, Rajiv, from a plane over the Himalayan mountains.<h2>
<a name="RajivGandhi"></a>Rajiv Gandhi</h2>Indira Gandhi was succeeded immediately after her death by her son <a name="cosubject_47746"></a><span class="headword">Rajiv Gandhi</span>  (1944&#150;1991), who had been groomed for the succession after the death of Sanjay. Aided by a great wave of sympathy for his bereavement, Rajiv led the Congress to a landslide victory in the general elections held in December 1984. He remained <span class="occ">prime minister</span> for a full term, until the Congress was defeated in the general elections held in November 1989, after which he became leader of the opposition in parliament. In the midst of mid-term elections in May&#150;June 1991 he, too, was assassinated in a suicide bomb blast in Madras, carried out on 21 May under the orders and by a member of the Liberation Front of Tamil Eelam, the Sri Lankan secessionist organization whose leader had become hostile to Rajiv because of his withdrawal of support to the movement. Rajiv's death brought to an end the dynastic succession in the prime minister's office of three generations of the Nehru family, who, in or out of office, were the central figures in Indian politics throughout the post-independence era.<h2>
<a name="IndiraGandhisreputation"></a>Indira Gandhi's reputation</h2>During the two decades in which she dominated Indian politics, Indira Gandhi left a mixed legacy of highly controversial actions and policies, some of them long-lasting, others short-lived. In her early years as prime minister she adopted policies consistent with the then socialist bent of the Indian state: bank nationalization and abolition of the privy purses of the princes, which persisted, and nationalization of the wholesale trade in wheat, which was withdrawn. The green revolution in agriculture also began during her first years in office. Most of the institutional changes introduced during the emergency lasted only as long as the emergency itself. During her last four years in office she shifted the Congress stance from its historic position of protector of minorities, particularly Muslims, towards one more identified with Hindu pride, thereby laying the basis for the rise of contemporary militant Hindu nationalism and the associated upsurge of Hindu&#150;Muslim riots. In her struggles to undermine her rivals and build new bases of support for herself and her party she patronized new leaders from among the middle (so-called &#145;backward&#146;) castes, lower castes, and tribals, which permanently altered political and social alignments in several of the Indian states. During her stewardship of the Indian National Congress the party organization became virtually defunct and dependent overwhelmingly on her personal appeal for its electoral success. Corruption in public office reached previously unheard-of proportions and became systematized.<br>
<br>In international relations she departed from Nehru's policy of non-alignment, and moved towards an alliance with the Soviet Union, formalized in the treaty of 1971. Even before this alliance relations with the United States had become embittered as a consequence of her criticism of US actions in Vietnam, her desire to free India from dependence upon US foreign aid, and the government of India's continued identification with the Palestinian cause and hostility to Israel. The lowest point in US&#150;Indian relations was reached during the Bangladesh crisis and the Third Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, when the United States threatened India with the dispatch of the nuclear-powered aircraft-carrier <i>Enterprise</i> into the Bay of Bengal. On 18 May 1974 she announced to the world that India had succeeded in carrying out an underground nuclear explosion, which she described as a &#145;peaceful nuclear test&#146;. In all these matters and many others Mrs Gandhi stood her ground against foreign criticism and objections and asserted calmly, proudly, and sometimes defiantly India's right to take an independent position in international politics.<br>
<br>Indira Gandhi in life and death was the most controversial Indian political personality of her times. Even members of her own family and her in-laws polarized around her. She remained an immensely popular figure for tens of millions of Indians, especially among the poor and otherwise disadvantaged groups and classes. However, although she retained the loyalty of many intellectuals identified with the left, the predominant image of Mrs Gandhi among most of the literate and especially the Westernized intellectual classes has become that of a paranoid personality, a political opportunist with no consistent or coherent political views, a wrecker of Indian political institutions, and a demagogue.<br>
<br>Mrs Gandhi's international reputation (aside from feelings towards her in the United States) was much more favourable, especially among the non-aligned countries, who looked to India and to her for leadership and defence of their economic interests against the industrialized powers. She was particularly favoured in the Soviet Union; honorary doctorates from Moscow State University and the Soviet Academy of Sciences were awarded to her in life as well as the Lenin prize after her death. Numerous other honours and awards of this type were also granted to her in Europe, including degrees from Oxford and the Sorbonne, in developing countries, and from international organizations. She received as well many such awards in her own country, including its highest honour after her successful prosecution of the Bangladesh war as prime minister, the bharat ratna.<br>
