<span class="headword">Kingston, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1476&#150;1540), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, is of uncertain origins, but was probably a member of a Gloucestershire family related to the barons Berkeley of Berkeley Castle; he also had some connection with the third duke of Buckingham. His marriages are uncertain as well: his first two wives (the order is unclear) were Anne, widow of Sir John Guise (<i>d</i>. 1501), and Elizabeth (surname unknown). By 1534 he had wed Mary, daughter of Richard Scrope and widow of Edward Jerningham (<i>d</i>. 1515) of Somerleighton, Suffolk. He had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15626/', "Anthony Kingston")</script>, and one or two daughters. A brother, George, was left &pound;40 in Sir William's will.<br>
<br>William's career as a courtier probably began in his early twenties. He was a yeoman of the chamber from 1497 to 1509 and was present at Henry VII's funeral as a gentleman usher. He served in Henry VIII's early military campaigns: in 1511 he received ordnance for the army and in 1512 he was named under-marshal. He travelled to Spain with Dr William Knight but had to report that their embassy to Charles V was not going well and that the English forces led by Thomas Grey, second marquess of Dorset, were disheartened. At the end of the year he was paid for his expenses after returning to England with a small entourage. In 1513 he fought at Flodden on 9 September, was knighted in October, and received conduct money for his men when the army was disbanded in November.<br>
<br>In 1510 Kingston and Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle, were licensed to export 2000 woollen kerseys without paying duty. A JP for Gloucestershire since 1506, in 1514 he was named one of the king's sewers with a stipend of 40 marks a year and was also pricked sheriff of Gloucestershire, in which capacity he was instructed to assist in apprehending heretics and Lollards. During these years he often took part in jousts, tournaments, and other courtly entertainments, in some of which the king himself participated. He was also sufficiently in favour with Cardinal Wolsey to be chosen one of the four &#145;knights of the body in the privy chamber&#146;, with a salary of &pound;100, when in May 1519 Henry was persuaded to dismiss his younger &#145;minions&#146; and replace them with more sober middle-aged knights. The minions were soon back at court, but Kingston's career did not suffer. Subsequent memoranda frequently list him among the king's attendants and as keeper of jewels and plate. In 1521 he was named one of the king's carvers.<br>
<br>On 20 April 1520 the English ambassador Sir Richard Wingfield reported from Blois how the three-year-old dauphin had taken &#145;a marvellous pleasure in young Kyngston, whom, after he had seen once, he called him <i>beau fils</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 3, pt 1, no. 752). Probably this was Sir William's son, Anthony, who was then about twelve; it is not recorded whether Sir William was present, but he certainly attended Henry VIII at the Field of Cloth of Gold in June and at his meeting with Charles V in July. Evidently in appreciation of his services, the king gave him a costly bay horse with cut ears, purchased from a French courtier.<br>
<br>Kingston was a member of the grand jury which indicted the third duke of Buckingham for treason in 1521 and subsequently profited from the duke's fall; Henry made him steward and bailiff of Buckingham's possessions in Gloucestershire as well as constable of Thornbury Castle and master of all the hunts in the county. At about the same time Kingston, who together with several other courtiers had lodgings in the Blackfriars, was granted three tenements with shops, cellars, and gardens in the parish of St Martin near Ludgate, to be held for the annual rent of a red rose.<br>
<br>In 1521 Henry VIII wished Kingston to attend him regularly in the privy chamber, as he had few other companions. Nevertheless in the following year he was charged with raising 300 &#145;pioneers&#146; in the Forest of Dean for service in France, and in 1523 he served in the army sent into Scotland, leading thirty men in the rearguard during a short campaign in which the earl of Surrey captured and burnt Kelso. Later in the year he left to serve in France under the duke of Suffolk, to Surrey's regret.<br>
<br>Kingston was a knight of the shire for Gloucestershire in the parliaments of 1529 and 1536. Between sessions he accompanied the king and Anne Boleyn to Calais in October 1532. Since he was a friend of the lord deputy, Viscount Lisle, he took a close interest in affairs there. In 1536 he wrote to Lisle concerning a book of ordinances for Calais that would shortly pass the Commons, &#145;but at the reading there was one that would have had it committed (as the manner is)&#146;, thereby providing interesting evidence for the growing use of parliamentary committees; Kingston assured Lisle that it would shortly pass and was &#145;a good book&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 10, no. 336). In the parliament of 1536 Kingston frequently acted as a liaison between the two houses. He spoke on the conservative side in the debate about the <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span> in 1539, rebuking the position taken on the eucharist by the evangelical Thomas Broke and even saying that if Broke repeated his arguments before the council after the act had passed, &#145;I will bring a fagot to help to burn you withal&#146;  (<span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>, 5.504&#150;5). Sir Nicholas Hare, the speaker, said that he found Kingston's remarks more offensive than Broke's.<br>
<br>As constable of the Tower from 28 May 1524 Kingston was responsible for the custody of a number of state prisoners. In November 1529 he was sent from London to Yorkshire to take charge of Wolsey and, according to the cardinal's biographer George Cavendish, treated his prisoner with consideration. He had several conversations with the dying minister, in one of which the latter advised him how to deal with the king if he ever became a privy councillor. Kingston, who subsequently told Henry how his mission had fared, was a councillor by 1533. In 1536 he similarly treated Anne Boleyn with respect during her imprisonment in the Tower, assuring her that she would be taken to the royal lodgings she had occupied before her coronation rather than to a dungeon, as she feared. It is possible, however, that his reports were the basis for some of the charges against Anne at her trial. His wife Mary was one of the queen's attendants before her execution, to which Kingston escorted her. In 1540 it was his duty to inform Thomas Cromwell of the charges against him, and presumably to carry the fallen minister's response to the king.<br>
<br>During the last years of his life Kingston received additional offices and lands. In 1539 he was named comptroller of the king's household and was installed as a knight of the Garter. He profited from the dissolution of the monasteries, in March 1537 receiving the site and possessions of the Cistercian abbey of Flaxley, Gloucestershire. He was granted a number of wardships, including that of Edmund Jerningham, his wife's son from her first marriage. After Cromwell's fall he acquired, for &pound;1000, the manors of Painswick and Morton Valence, both in Gloucestershire, which Cromwell had purchased from the Lisles for &pound;1400.<br>
<br>Kingston died at Painswick on 14 September 1540 and was buried there. In his will, drawn up on 26 June 1539, he made a traditional bequest of his soul to God, the Virgin, and the heavenly host. Among numerous bequests of money, plate, and clothes, he left to his son and heir, Anthony, six great silver-gilt bowls given him by the king of France. His wife, William Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton, and Sir Anthony Browne were named as his executors.<br>
