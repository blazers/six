<span class="headword">Wroth,  (Charles) Peter</span>  (1929&#150;1991), <span class="occ">civil engineer and soil mechanic</span>, was born on 2 June 1929 at Alndyke, Russells Crescent, Horley, Surrey, the son of Charles Wroth, physician, and his wife, Violet Beynon Jenour. He was educated at Marlborough College and, after national service in the Royal Artillery, went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he read mathematics and mechanical sciences.<br>
<br>After a brief spell of teaching at Felsted School, Wroth returned to Cambridge, as a research student, in 1954. He married on 11 December of that year Mary Parlane Weller (1927&#150;1988), daughter of Christopher Harold Weller, a minister of religion. His Cambridge supervisor was the charismatic Ken Roscoe, who was building up a group working in soil mechanics, a branch of civil engineering. Roscoe's group was bringing a new scientific rigour to the subject, and Wroth's doctoral research, which involved both laboratory tests and theory, was central to this programme. On completing his research he joined the civil engineering consultants G. Maunsell &amp; Partners, where he worked on the design and construction of the innovative pre-stressed concrete flyover at Hammersmith, in west London. He returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in 1961 and soon became a fellow of Churchill College. As tutor for advanced students at Churchill he had responsibility for graduates there, a role he clearly relished. The following years were busy with teaching and research, and with family life, which now included twin daughters, Rachel and Helen, and two sons, Richard and Christopher.<br>
<br>The book that Wroth co-authored with Andrew Schofield, <span class="italic">Critical State Soil Mechanics</span> (1968), represented a fundamental change in the approach to the subject, one that many readers found hard to grasp. Gradually, however, the ideas became established, and now form the core understanding of how soils behave as engineering materials. Much of this acceptance was due to Wroth's clear exposition of the subject in lectures and courses. His lecturing style was a model of precision, often supported by multi-coloured diagrams neatly drawn on the overhead projector during his talk.<br>
<br>In 1970 Roscoe died in a car crash, and Wroth stepped in to lead the soil mechanics group. The professorship, however, went to his friend and rival Schofield, who was at that time at Manchester. With Wroth and Schofield both at the peak of their careers the Cambridge soil mechanics group went from strength to strength, carrying out first-class experimental and theoretical work. It was at this time that Wroth developed the &#145;self-boring pressuremeter&#146;, an ingenious device for measuring the properties of soils. One of its attractions for him was that it offered scope for elegant analyses that could be used to convert measured data to useful soil properties. He travelled widely, taking his sabbatical leave at Cornell and Duke universities in the USA, and establishing links with a number of groups worldwide, especially in Australia.<br>
<br>In 1979 Wroth moved to Oxford University, as professor of engineering science and fellow of Brasenose College. For the next ten years, as head of the department of engineering science, he developed it as a broad-based engineering school. During his tenure the department expanded enormously in terms of buildings, staff, and students. At the same time he built up a substantial research group in soil mechanics and played a central role in the geotechnical community in the UK and internationally, as chairman of the British Geotechnical Society, editor of the academic journal <span class="italic">G&eacute;otechnique</span>, and, in 1984, as the Rankine lecturer. Although a busy man he was particularly generous with the support that he gave to his students and junior colleagues, whom he encouraged to develop their own careers by participating at conferences and meeting the leading academics in the field. He was a talented sportsman; at hockey he was a Cambridge blue, and he went on to captain Wales for several seasons. He had played for the Cambridge second cricket eleven, and enjoyed his golf. He had a lifelong enthusiasm for the more esoteric sport of real tennis, no doubt because it offered an intellectual as well as a physical challenge.<br>
<br>Following the protracted illness and death from cancer of his wife, Mary, in 1988, Wroth married on 8 July 1989 Rachel Anne (<i>b</i>. 1943), daughter of the retired professor Denis King Britton and herself a fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge. The following year they spent principally on sabbatical leave in Australia and New Zealand. During this time Wroth was elected master of Emmanuel, his old undergraduate college. He took up the mastership in Michaelmas term 1990, but his return to Cambridge was all too brief. He became unwell in mid-December, suffering from myeloma. The cancer developed very rapidly, and he died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 3 February 1991. His wife survived him.<br>
