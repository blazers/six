<span class="headword">Trevelyan <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bell]</span>,  Mary Katharine <span class="st"> [Molly]</span></span>, Lady Trevelyan  (1881&#150;1966), <span class="occ">political hostess and voluntary worker</span>, was born on 12 October 1881, the youngest of three children of Sir (Thomas) Hugh Bell, second baronet and iron master (1844&#150;1931), and his second wife, Florence Eveleen Eleanore Olliffe, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41106/', "Lady Bell (1851&#150;1930)")</script>, the author and social investigator. Her half-sister was the Arabic scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30686/', "Gertrude Bell")</script>, and her grandfather was Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, first baronet, the steel manufacturer and Liberal MP. Molly, as she was universally known, had a comfortable childhood, but her home education consisted primarily of preparation for marriage. She developed a lifelong love of embroidery, music, and languages, and in 1917 she co-wrote a French textbook with her mother, from whom she also acquired an interest in social conditions. After studying briefly at Queen's College, London, she came out in 1899. Although her father was lord lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire, there were few politicians in her family's social circle, so when she began a relationship with the Liberal MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36553/', "Sir Charles Philips Trevelyan, third baronet (1870&#150;1958)")</script>, she regretted her lack of political knowledge. However, he hoped that her youth and beauty could be used for high ends, and after they married on 6 January 1904 and set up house in London she became a successful political hostess, arranging dinners and parties for political friends.<br>
<br>As well as political entertaining Molly Trevelyan pursued a more public role after 1904 as president of the Northumberland Women's Liberal Federation (WLF). She became a popular speaker around the country and favoured women's suffrage, an issue which deeply divided the WLF, but she disliked militancy and did not feel strongly enough to work for the cause. Her husband also supported women's suffrage, but adhered to traditional notions of men's and women's roles, and Molly eventually abandoned her hope that their marriage would be an equal political partnership. She none the less helped him in various ways, from translating German material on land reform to campaigning energetically at every election until his last in 1931, including the difficult election of 1918 when he was attacked for having opposed the war.<br>
<br>After Charles Trevelyan inherited his ancestral home of Wallington Hall, Northumberland, in 1928, they devoted much of the rest of their lives to the estate and the village of Cambo. She and Charles were keenly interested in their tenants' welfare and established a pension plan for schoolchildren. A deeply practical woman, she was not above putting her hand to any work the estate required, and planned and oversaw alterations to the tenants' cottages and farmhouses. In addition to estate work she was a JP and was active with numerous local, national, and international organizations, such as the Workers' Educational Association and the Association of Country Women of the World. She founded branches of the Girl Guides and the Women's Institute in Cambo, and served on the national executive of the National Federation of Women's Institutes for many years. In keeping with her temperance principles she also founded in Cambo a Band of Hope, which local children were pledged to join at a young age. She also played a leading role in the Folk Dance and Northumbrian Pipers societies, and made music an important feature of her family's life. Singing songs, accompanied by Molly on the piano, was a regular part of their domestic routine, and she and Charles also delighted their children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62147/', "George Lowthian Trevelyan")</script>, by regularly reading to them from a diverse selection of classic literature. Such activities took the place of attending church on Sundays, for while Molly was Unitarian, Charles was agnostic. In appearance her clothes, hairstyle, and pince-nez gave her a Victorian air, and one contemporary described her as attractive in a &#145;no nonsense&#146; sort of way. Her decades of public service, to politics and various other good causes, were recognized with an OBE in 1963, shortly before her death at St Catherine's Nursing Home, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 8 October 1966. Her ashes were scattered on moorland near Winter's Gibbet on the Wallington estate.<br>
