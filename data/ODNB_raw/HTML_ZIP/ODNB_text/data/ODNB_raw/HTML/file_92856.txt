<span class="headword">Eccles <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Crapo; <em>other married name </em>Hyde]</span>,  Mary Morley</span>, Viscountess Eccles  (1912&#150;2003), <span class="occ">literary collector and scholar</span>, was born on 8 July 1912 in Detroit, Michigan, USA, the last child of Stanford Tappan Crapo (1865&#150;1939), landowner and businessman, and his wife, Emma Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morley (1872&#150;1937). The Crapo family traced its descent from a French sailor, nicknamed Crapaud, who was washed ashore on Cape Cod in the late seventeenth century and founded a dynasty of whalers. Mary's great-grandfather, Henry Howland Crapo, left New England before the civil war to make his fortune in Michigan, where he was governor from 1864 until shortly before his death in 1869. From this paternal line Mary Crapo inherited a love of literature, a taste for country life, and the means with which to cultivate both.<br>
<br>Though rooted in Michigan the Crapo family continued to take its educational and professional bearings from the north-east. Accordingly Mary Crapo attended Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey (1926&#150;30), and Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York (1930&#150;34). A passion for drama led her to contemplate a career as a playwright, but ultimately she decided to explore the theatre from a scholarly vantagepoint, entering the graduate programme in English at Columbia University in 1934. After taking her MA the following year she embarked on a doctoral dissertation that earned her a PhD in 1945. Her thesis was published by Columbia University Press as <span class="italic">Playwrighting for Elizabethans, 1600&#150;1605</span> (1949).<br>
<br>The eighteenth-century interests of Donald Frizell Hyde (1909&#150;1966), a lawyer whom she married on 16 September 1939, turned Mary's attention to Samuel Johnson and his circle. Beginning with the A. E. Newton sale of 1941, the Hydes began to acquire Johnsonian books and manuscripts, assisted by the legendary dealer A. S. W. Rosenbach and the swashbuckling collector R. H. Isham. In 1948 they outmanoeuvred Yale University to secure the great R. B. Adam collection. By the following decade the Hydes' library at Four Oaks Farm in Somerville, northern New Jersey, had become a place of pilgrimage. Not only did they share their treasures with scholars and students, but they contributed to scholarship themselves, collaborating with E. L. McAdam on the first volume of the Yale edition of the works of Samuel Johnson, <span class="italic">Diaries, Prayers, and Annals</span> (1958). While adding to their Johnsonian and Boswellian holdings, the Hydes also built up significant collections of Oscar Wilde and of Japanese books and manuscripts.<br>
<br>After the death of her first husband Mary Hyde threw herself into the writing of books that drew on materials in the Hyde collection. <span class="italic">The Impossible Friendship: Boswell and Mrs. Thrale</span> (1972) was followed by <span class="italic">The Thrales of Streatham Park</span> (1976), which transcribed and interpreted Hester Thrale's intimate record of family life. Mary Hyde's engrossing study was dedicated to &#145;Our Godchildren&#146;&#151;a poignant reflection of the fact that the Hydes were childless. She made similar use of her G. B. Shaw archive in <span class="italic">Bernard Shaw and Alfred Douglas: a Correspondence</span> (1982).<br>
<br>Like the heroine of a novel by James or Wharton, this American heiress entered the English peerage as the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71965/', "David McAdam Eccles, first Viscount Eccles (1904&#150;1999)")</script>, a businessman, book collector, and politician who had served as a cabinet minister under Churchill, Eden, and Macmillan. After marrying in London on 26 September 1984 the couple divided their time between Four Oaks Farm and Lord Eccles's two English residences, in Wiltshire and Westminster. The following year Mary Eccles was elected to the Roxburghe Club, its first female member. Encouraged by her new husband, she helped to launch, guide, and support <span class="italic">The Letters of Samuel Johnson</span> (1992&#150;4), a five-volume edition that was later described as &#145;the definitive monument to the collection&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 5 Sept 2003). The definitive monument to her second marriage took the form of the David and Mary Eccles Centre for American Studies, established at the British Library in 1992. Her philanthropic ventures continued after Lord Eccles's death in 1999, as did her collecting and writing: when she died at Four Oaks Farm, on 26 August 2003, she was at work on a study of the library at Streatham Park.<br>
<br>At Four Oaks Farm, as at Streatham Park, Samuel Johnson presided as <i>genius loci</i>, his portrait by Joshua Reynolds hanging in a place of honour. This was only one of the many parallels, some designed and others coincidental, that linked Mary Eccles to Hester Thrale. It is significant that, not long before her death, she acquired Johnson's letters to Mrs Thrale's eldest daughter, Queeney. His advice and hopes were realized in the mistress of Four Oaks: &#145;keep your eyes and your ears open, and enjoy as much of the intellectual world as You can &hellip; that You, my dearest, may in every sense live long, and in every sense live well is the desire of, Your humble servant, S<span class="smallcap">AM</span>. J<span class="smallcap">OHNSON</span>&#146;  (B. Redford, ed., <span class="italic">The Letters of Samuel Johnson</span>, vol. 3, 1992, 235).<br>
