<span class="headword">Johnson,  Percival Norton</span>  (1792&#150;1866), <span class="occ">metallurgist</span>, was born on 29 September 1792 at 6&#150;7 Maiden Lane, in the City of London, the third of the ten children of John Johnson (1765&#150;1831), assayer of ores and metals, and his wife, Mary (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wight) (1766&#150;1863). Percival was Johnson's only Christian name in the baptismal register and it is not known when he acquired the additional name of Norton. Furthermore, nothing is known of his early life and education. He was apprenticed to his father in the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, obtaining the freedom of the company on 2 March 1814 and becoming a liveryman on 24 April 1816. On 1 January 1817 he married Elizabeth Lydia Smith (1794&#150;1857), fourth daughter of Thomas Smith, receiver-general to the dean and chapter of St Paul's Cathedral; they were to have no children.<br>
<br>At about the same time as his marriage, Johnson set up on his own, first in the City and from 1822 in Hatton Garden, Holborn. His friend and brother-in-law, Thomas Cock, who had evolved a process for making platinum malleable, assisted in the early development of the business, which included assaying and refining, and the preparation of colours for the decoration of pottery and glass. In time Johnson perfected a number of pottery colours, including a much sought-after rose pink, and a range of yellows and oranges based on uranium oxide. Following a visit to Germany, Johnson commenced production of an alloy containing nickel, copper, and zinc, which was known by various names including nickel silver, German silver and British plate. During preparation of this alloy, used largely for the manufacture of spoons, forks, and candlesticks, he refined nickel for the first time in England.<br>
<br>The first of many publications by Percival appeared in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span> in July 1812 and concerned the parting of platinum from gold. A footnote initialled by both him and his father reported an original observation, that Brazilian gold could be discoloured by the presence of palladium. Some twenty years later Percival successfully refined crude gold from the Gongo Soco mines in Brazil, which had defeated other refiners because of the presence of palladium and tellurium. Rapid expansion of his firm followed, funded in part by Captain W. R. B. Sellon (formerly Smith) another brother-in-law. Johnson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1846.<br>
<br>In 1838 Johnson implemented an agreement with John Matthey, a stockbroker, whereby, in return for the injection of new capital, the latter's sons, George and Edward, should enter the business. The company became Johnson and Matthey in September 1851 when George Matthey was taken into full partnership. By persistent scientific endeavour and acute business sense, Matthey was to transform the refining and fabrication of platinum from a laboratory activity into a successful industrial operation, making platinum available for use throughout the world. The firm's assaying expertise was recognized in 1852 when the company was appointed assayers to the Bank of England.<br>
<br>Johnson's scientific work brought him into contact with numerous mining enterprises, especially in Devon and Cornwall, though he also advised governments and mining companies in many parts of the world. This led him to become involved, in a managerial capacity and financially, in both mining and smelting. As a result, from 1854 he lived mainly in Devon. In addition to introducing many pioneering technical practices, he worked to improve the social conditions of the miners and their families. For instance, at great expense to himself he had schools erected in the neighbourhood of the mines, and he took an active part in their supervision. In this he was supported by his wife, Elizabeth, who did much charitable work. She was also the prime mover in the formation of the London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read (later the Royal London Society for the Blind).<br>
<br>Elizabeth Johnson died on 8 September 1857; fourteen months later, on 25 November 1858, Percival Johnson married Georgina Elizabeth Ellis, daughter of George Stevenson Ellis, formerly head of the bullion office at the Bank of England. Since 1852 Johnson had gradually withdrawn from his mining activities; he retired from Johnson and Matthey on 31 March 1860 and died of a stroke at his home, Stoke House, Stoke Fleming, Devon, on 1 June 1866, at the age of seventy-three. He was buried in a vault under the chancel of St Peter's Church, Stoke Fleming, where a stained-glass memorial window was later placed by his widow (in this the year of his birth was given incorrectly as 1793). The business that Johnson founded was eventually to become Johnson Matthey plc, a world leader in the refining, marketing, and fabrication of precious metals and raw materials.<br>
