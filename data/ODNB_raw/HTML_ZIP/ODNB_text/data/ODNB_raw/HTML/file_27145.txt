<span class="headword">Terrot,  Charles</span>  (1758&#150;1839), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Berwick upon Tweed on 1 May 1758, eldest son of Charles Terrot, captain of invalids and commander of the garrison, and Elizabeth Pratt, of an established local family. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, on 15 March 1771. He was commissioned second lieutenant on 1 March 1774 and in 1776 volunteered for service in North America; he first saw action at Three Rivers on 8 June when the Americans were forced to withdraw to Ticonderoga. In June 1777 he joined General Burgoyne's army on its advance from Canada. After the taking of Ticonderoga on 6 July, he took command of the artillery there, and helped beat off an American attack in September.<br>
<br>After Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga, Terrot returned to Canada. On 7 July 1779 he was promoted first lieutenant and in 1780 went to Niagara where he remained for nearly four years and was employed chiefly as an assistant military engineer. The defences of the place were fully repaired under his supervision. In 1782 he surveyed the country between lakes Erie and Ontario with a view to its purchase by the government from the Native Americans. He conducted the subsequent negotiations with the indigenous peoples to their satisfaction and to the considerable advantage of the government. On 8 March 1784 he was promoted captain-lieutenant and returned to England. In 1791 he volunteered for service in India and arrived at Madras on 10 October as quartermaster to a force of two artillery companies. He subsequently joined Lord Cornwallis's army and in February 1792 took part in the siege of Seringapatam until peace terms were agreed with Tipu Sultan. On 26 March he moved with the army marching to Madras which was reached in May.<br>
<br>On the opening of the war with France, Terrot, still acting as quartermaster, took part in the attack on Pondicherry which, after a brief bombardment, was successfully concluded on 23 August 1793. On 25 September he was promoted to captain and returned to England to command no. 3 company, 1st battalion Royal Artillery, at Portsmouth. On 1 March 1794 he was made brevet major for his services and became commander of the artillery at Portsmouth and of the south-west district. He married Eleanor Bell on 29 April 1795 at Berwick upon Tweed; they had three children. He was made a brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1798. The following year he served during the Helder expedition, landing on 27 August, and joining in the action at Bergen on 19 September under the duke of York, at Alkmaar on 2 October, and at Beverwijk on the 6th. On the conclusion of hostilities he returned to England in November only to be shipwrecked off Yarmouth in company with Anthony Farrington and, like him, lost all his baggage.<br>
<br>Terrot was promoted major in the regiment on 12 November 1800 and lieutenant-colonel on 14 October 1801. After a period of regimental duty he was promoted colonel, Royal Artillery, on 1 June 1806. In July 1809 he joined the expedition to the Scheldt and directed the artillery at the siege of Flushing which surrendered on 15 August. He was briefly involved in a demand for the city's church bells, or cash in lieu, as outdated tradition required. This was refused both by the city and by the British government and was never attempted again.<br>
<br>Terrot became a major-general on 4 June 1811 and in 1814 was sent to command the artillery at Gibraltar in succession to Major-General John Smith. The latter, however, owing to the death of the governor, had succeeded to the command of the fortress, and refused to be relieved. Having vainly awaited developments, after three months Terrot successfully sought permission to return to England. He resigned his appointment and retired on 23 September 1815 on a pension of &pound;700 a year backdated to 25 June 1814. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on the retired list on 12 August 1819 and to full general on 10 January 1837. He died in Newcastle upon Tyne on 23 September 1839.<br>
