<span class="headword">Bolton,  Robert</span>  (1697&#150;1763), <span class="occ">dean of Carlisle</span>, was born in April 1697 in London, the son of John Bolton (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1699), a merchant of Lambeth. His early education was in Kensington, after which he went to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1712, where he became a scholar in 1713, graduated BA in 1715, and proceeded MA in 1718. He was awarded the Lambeth degree of LLD in 1735. At Wadham, Bolton had hoped to be &#145;elected fellow in his turn; but in this he was disappointed, and appealed without success&#146; to the college visitor, George Hooper, bishop of Bath and Wells  (Coates, 118). By 20 December 1719, when he was ordained deacon in St Paul's Cathedral by John Robinson, bishop of London, Bolton had transferred to Hart Hall, Oxford; but he served his title in Stepney. Robinson ordained him priest in Fulham Chapel on 11 April 1721.<br>
<br>Bolton stayed with the bishop for two years, perhaps as chaplain. In 1722 he joined Dulwich College, and lived there. Though he was not elected first fellow (or preacher) until March 1725, there is clear evidence of his activity in the college as early as March 1723. After resigning the fellowship in May 1725 he moved to Kensington where he lived off his private income. Here he became friendly with William Whiston, the mathematician and rationalist, who had lost his Cambridge mathematical professorship on account of his Arian views. Whiston introduced Bolton to Sir Joseph Jekyll, master of the rolls, and Philip Yorke who, as earl of Hardwicke, became lord chief justice and then lord chancellor. Whiston's son John later claimed Bolton shared his father's views, but this did not stop him subscribing to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>.<br>
<br>In 1729 Jekyll nominated Bolton preacher at the Rolls Chapel in succession to Joseph Butler, later bishop of Durham. Doubtless it was through Hardwicke's patronage that Bolton was appointed dean of Carlisle; he was installed by proxy in February 1735. Though eventually he bequeathed money to support poor clergy in the diocese, Carlisle records reveal him as totally non-resident there. He showed more interest in his parish of St Mary's, Reading, where he became vicar in 1738. This was another crown appointment which he held concurrently with the deanery. Despite having a curate he was present at five of the eight triennial visitations and preached at two; and in July 1763, only four months before his death in London on 26 November, he was present at the primary visitation by John Gilbert, bishop of Salisbury. Certainly a sermon after his death describes him as &#145;constantly almost residing in this place &hellip; he held forth to all by his daily example and pressed upon [his parishioners] by his weekly instruction and exhortation&#146;  (Wray, 27&#150;8). The same sermon described him as &#145;an excellent scholar, as well as a most pious Christian, as exemplary in his life as instructive in his writings&#146;  (ibid., 33). He was buried in the church porch at St Mary's, Reading.<br>
<br>Bolton's publications were mainly tracts and sermons, and included pieces such as <span class="italic">An answer to the question&#151;Where are your arguments against what you call lewdness, if you make no use of the Bible</span> (1755), with references to Greek and Roman authors; and a curious work about Duke Ernest I of Saxe-Gotha (1601&#150;1675), entitled <span class="italic">The ghost of Ernest, great-grandfather of HRH the princess dowager of Wales, with some account of his life</span> (1757).<br>
