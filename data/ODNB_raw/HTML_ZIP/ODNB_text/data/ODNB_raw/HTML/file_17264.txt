<span class="headword">Lyndwood,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1375&#150;1446), <span class="occ">administrator, ecclesiastical lawyer, and bishop of St David's</span>, was born in Linwood, near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire. One of the seven children of John Lyndwood (<i>d</i>. 1419), a successful woolman, and his wife, Alice, William Lyndwood is depicted as a child, but dressed precociously in the robes of a doctor of laws, on his father's monumental brass in Linwood parish church.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>The first step in Lyndwood's education that can be traced was as a commoner at Gonville Hall, Cambridge; an inscription by a window in the old library of Gonville and Caius College enjoined viewers to offer prayers on his behalf. However, only the outlines of his subsequent academic career are visible. He is reported to have become a fellow at Pembroke College, and at some point during these early years he moved to Oxford, where, according to Thomas Fuller, he &#145;proceeded doctor of laws (probably rather by incorporation than constant education&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 2.10). He was at any rate BCL by 1403 and DCnL and DCL by 1407, and Lyndwood himself referred to his having lectured on the canon law. He also took holy orders at about the same time; he was made deacon on 15 February 1404, and priest on 12 March 1407.<br>
<br>Only a little more than a year after receipt of his doctorate, Robert Hallum, bishop of Salisbury, commissioned Lyndwood to serve as official of his consistory court at Salisbury, the first step in a judicial career that led remarkably quickly to the highest judicial offices in the English church. In 1414 Archbishop Henry Chichele, with whom Lyndwood had been associated at Oxford, and to whom he later dedicated the <span class="italic">Provinciale</span>, nominated him as chancellor and auditor of causes in his court of audience. Three years later Lyndwood became the official principal of the court of arches in London. Court documents issued in his name have been preserved in contemporary formularies. Besides handling the ecclesiastical litigation routinely dealt with in these courts, he was delegated from time to time to judge a number of maritime cases, and he also took part in some of the prosecutions of Lollards that occurred during these years. Lyndwood served as prelocutor for the lower clergy at provincial convocations in 1419, 1421, 1424, 1425, and 1426, and in January 1431 he acted in the place of an indisposed Archbishop John Kemp of York, to deliver a sermon devoted to the blessings of unity within the realm at the opening of parliament.<br>
<br>Such an administrative and judicial career was not then thought incompatible with the holding of ecclesiastical benefices, at least if obtained with the proper dispensations, and Lyndwood accumulated a considerable number over the course of his career. In a purely economic sense, they were the base of that career, providing him with a stream of income without requiring performance of the duties associated with the cure of souls. The first recorded benefice came to him even before he had been ordained deacon. On 30 November 1396, through royal patronage he was preferred to the wardenship of St Nicholas's Hospital, Scarborough. To this benefice, he added the wardenship of St Mary's Chapel in Scarborough Castle on 25 January 1399. In November 1403 he became rector of Walton on the Wolds, Leicestershire. He had surrendered this rectory by March 1410, when he was collated to the benefice of Winfrith Newburgh, Dorset, a benefice he later surrendered in exchange for the parish of St Mary in Romney Marsh, Kent, in March 1417. In September 1411 he had received a papal dispensation allowing him to hold an additional incompatible benefice with or without cure of souls for seven years, a dispensation that was made perpetual in 1421. Following this grant, he became rector of Shoreham in Kent with the dependent chapel of Otford in October 1415 (vacated by August 1425), rector of All Hallows, Bread Street, London (vacant by August 1433, when he became rector of Wimbledon), and in 1424 rector of Tring in Hertfordshire (occupied until he became a bishop), a parish he remembered with the gift of a book in his will. In addition to these benefices, Lyndwood held prebends in what now seems an astonishingly large number of England's cathedral churches: Exeter, where he was canon and prebendary from 1419 to 1442; Hereford, where after a dispute with Thomas Berkeley in the 1420s he occupied the prebend of Hunderton until 1442; Lincoln, where he was archdeacon of Stow between 1434 and 1442; St David's, where he was canon and prebendary of Llanwrthwl from 1421 to 1442; Salisbury, where he held the prebend of Ruscombe Southbury from 1412 to 1424, and that of Bishopstone from 1424 to 1434; and Bath and Wells, where he was prebendary of Taunton from 1419 until 1433.<h2>
<a name="Diplomatandbishop"></a>Diplomat and bishop</h2>As with many prominent civilians, Lyndwood's talents found an outlet in diplomacy. Already in July 1417 he had accompanied Henry Ware, keeper of the privy seal, to Calais to negotiate the extension of the truce with the duke of Burgundy. In 1422 he was sent to Portugal to help negotiate a treaty with that country, and in the following year he accompanied John Kemp on a diplomatic mission in France. In 1431 he was chosen to be a member of the retinue that attended the coronation of Henry VI as king of France on 16 December, and when he returned to England early the following year, he was appointed keeper of the privy seal. Subsequently he was involved in negotiations leading up to the congress of Arras in 1435, and also in the formulation of several agreements with the Hanseatic League and other German interests, various commercial treaties in the Low Countries, and in 1438 a truce with the Scots.<br>
<br>Besides the continuing and active part he took in convocation, Lyndwood was called upon to give articulate voice to English interests at the Council of Basel (1431&#150;2). He played a part in the foundation of Eton College, and was also appointed one of the commissioners responsible for drafting the statutes of King's College, Cambridge. Finally, and rather late in life for so prominent an ecclesiastic, he was given the Welsh bishopric of St David's after the death of Thomas Rodeburne in 1442. He was provided by the pope to the see on 27 June, received the temporalities on 14 August, and was consecrated on 26 August. He held the see until his death, which occurred on either 21 or 22 October 1446. His will was proved on 26 November 1446, and his body was buried in St Stephen's Chapel in the palace of Westminster, following the desires expressed in the will. The later history of the burial spot is uncertain, but in 1852 a body with a crosier thought to be Lyndwood's was discovered in the crypt. It was reinterred in Westminster Abbey in the north wall of the north cloister, a short distance from the east entrance door. The black marble ledger, under which it rests, is unfortunately now invisible because of construction carried out at a later date around the cloister door.<h2>
<a name="TheProvincialeitspurposeandprincipalfeatures"></a>The Provinciale: its purpose and principal features</h2>Lyndwood's enduring reputation rests not on his career, successful though that was. It rests on the compilation of a single work, the <span class="italic">Provinciale</span>, which he had begun by 1422, while he was serving as judge in the court of arches, and which he had completed by January 1434. Although early references exist to two other works by Lyndwood, the one his lectures on the <span class="italic">Decretum Gratiani</span>, the other a commentary on a portion of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, the <span class="italic">Provinciale</span> alone has survived. It is a collection of the most important ecclesiastical legislation enacted within the province of Canterbury between the Council of Oxford in 1222 and Chichele's archiepiscopate. To these statutes, or constitutions as they were more properly called, Lyndwood added two royal responses to clerical demands made in the constitutions: the writ <span class="italic">Circumspecte agatis</span> (1286) and part of the <span class="italic">Articuli cleri</span> (1316). The completed <span class="italic">Provinciale</span> was accompanied by a comprehensive subject matter index, bearing a Latinized form of his name (Gulielmus de Tylia Nemore) and, more importantly, by his own extensive marginal gloss. In the fashion of the European <i>ius commune</i> (as the amalgam of Roman and canon law taught in continental universities was known), the gloss clarified the meaning of the constitutions, related them to the general law of the church, raised legal points of doubt and controversy, and commented upon their observance in the English spiritual courts.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Provinciale</span> belongs firmly within continental legal traditions. This is so not simply because the authorities Lyndwood cited were the treatises of continental jurists. It is also a fair assessment because, in so far as his great work has a theme, that theme is the harmonization of the English provincial constitutions with the law of the Western church. He organized his work into five books, each divided into separate titles, thereby following exactly the model of the basic canonical text, the <span class="italic">Decretales Gregorii IX</span> (1234), rather than the chronological order of the constitutions. Similarly, the work's first title is <span class="italic">De summa trinitate et de fide catholica</span>, just as it is in the <span class="italic">Decretals</span> and the Roman law codex. In it, Lyndwood placed a constitution from the Council of Lambeth (1281) designed &#145;for the information of simple priests&#146; in the rudiments of the Christian faith  (<span class="italic">Councils &amp; Synods</span>, vol. 2, ed. F. M. Powicke and C. R. Cheney, 2 vols., 1964, 2.900).<br>
<br>It must be admitted that, despite Lyndwood's best efforts, the fit between his project and the canonical texts of the Western church was far from perfect. Lyndwood was obliged by the material at his disposal to omit some of the titles that appeared in the <span class="italic">Decretals</span>. There is no heading <span class="italic">De rescriptis</span>, for instance. Papal rescripts of justice were not a subject treated by the English provincial constitutions. Moreover, local conditions required that some subjects be treated at greater length than is found in the <span class="italic">Decretals</span>. For example, Lyndwood's title <span class="italic">De testamentis</span> occupies a proportionally larger share than that same title does in the Gregorian <span class="italic">Decretals</span>&#151;one result of the English church's more expansive jurisdiction over testamentary succession compared to that of most continental churches. Conversely, Lyndwood's title <span class="italic">De jure patronatus</span> occupies a lesser share of his treatment. The English royal courts kept spiritual jurisdiction over patronage questions within narrower limits compared to most places across the channel. Lyndwood was also obliged to put the law of defamation under the title <span class="italic">De sententia excommunicationis</span>, rather than the title <span class="italic">De iniuriis</span>, where a continental jurist would have thought it more apt, because defamation was incorporated into the decrees of the Council of Oxford (1222) excommunicating several kinds of violators of the church's laws.<h2>
<a name="ImpactoftheProvinciale"></a>Impact of the Provinciale</h2>Lyndwood's <span class="italic">Provinciale</span> filled a real need. The constitutions it collected and upon which its gloss commented were of immediate importance in the work of the English spiritual courts, and no other source dealt with them so directly. Lyndwood himself evidently held a high opinion of the value of his work. His will provided that it should be chained and kept in St Stephen's Chapel in Westminster Abbey, so that recourse could be had to it &#145;for the correction of other books to be copied from the same treatise&#146;  (Hunter, 419). The fate of this volume, or that of the other copy Lyndwood mentioned with particular approbation in his will, cannot now be discovered. It seems unlikely that a single archetype can be found, given the variations in the text and glosses in the fifty-five or so manuscripts that have survived to the present day.<br>
<br>By modern editing standards, Lyndwood's method of compiling the constitutions seems quite inadequate. He was guilty of false attributions and he transcribed some of the texts incorrectly. He seems to have deliberately changed the wording in a few instances. However, Lyndwood's goal was not to produce a historically accurate transcription. It was to produce a serviceable collection of texts and commentary, suitable for use in the everyday study and practice of ecclesiastical law in England. Subsequent experience shows that he did not miss the mark. That it was considered an economic proposition to reprint Lyndwood's work so many times is a tribute to its success. The constitutions around which it was built controlled the character of much of the litigation heard in the consistory courts, and Lyndwood's gloss is the best guide to that character. English parochial clergy, academics, and professional ecclesiastical lawyers all owned and used copies of this book.<br>
<br>The Reformation did not curtail its currency in England. Because the scope of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in England was not fundamentally changed during the sixteenth century, ecclesiastical lawyers continued to use the <span class="italic">Provinciale</span>. Its influence has been quite long-lasting. Edmund Gibson testified to its influence upon later generations in his <span class="italic">Codex juris ecclesiastici Anglicani</span> (1713), and in the twentieth century it was used in the draft revision of English canon law of 1947 produced by the Vaisey Commission. The relevance of its treatment of English ecclesiastical practice recommended it even to English common lawyers. Their citation of the glosses of the <span class="italic">Provinciale</span> when questions of ecclesiastical law arose in the royal courts is a continuing feature in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century reports.<h2>
<a name="PublicationsoftheProvinciale"></a>Publications of the Provinciale</h2>Whatever the problems of textual transmission, the later history of the <span class="italic">Provinciale</span> amply confirms the high opinion Lyndwood and his contemporaries had of the work. It appeared in thirteen pre-1640 editions listed in the <span class="italic">Short-Title Catalogue</span>. The earliest was printed in Oxford, probably in 1483, under the imprint of Thomas Rood. An impressive volume of some 350 folios, it was not only larger than any book printed there for the next hundred years, it was also one of the first law books to be printed in England. An octavo edition, without the gloss, was published with Caxton's cipher at Westminster in 1496. This text was itself reprinted by the same editor with minor variations and abridgements in 1499, and also twice in that year by Richard Pynson. Other London editions appeared in 1517, 1529, and 1557. An English translation without the gloss was published by Robert Redman in 1534. Continental publishers also took it up. Folio editions of the work, including the entire gloss and supplements from the constitutions of cardinals Otto and Ottobuono (papal legates to England during the reign of Henry III), were published in Paris in 1501, 1504, and 1505, and an edition also appeared at Antwerp in 1525.<br>
<br>Thereafter the demand for it lessened, perhaps because of the extent of printing that had already occurred and the uncertainty about the future of the canon law in England that was caused by the Reformation. However, a later version, edited and abridged by Robert Sharrock of New College, Oxford, was printed there in 1664 under the title <span class="italic">Provinciale vetus provinciae cantuariensis</span>. This edition was followed quickly by what has become the standard edition, the <span class="italic">Provinciale (seu Constitutiones Angliae</span>) printed at Oxford in 1679. It includes Lyndwood's full gloss, the constitutions of Otto and Ottobuono, together with the gloss on them written about 1340 by John Atton (or Acton). Its reprinting in 1968 stands as a reminder that it deserves the accolade once conferred upon it by Thomas Fuller. He described it as a work &#145;highly esteemed by foreign lawyers&#146;, and as one that would &#145;be valued by the judicious whilst learning and civility have a being&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Church History</span>, 1.500).<br>
