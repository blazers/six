<span class="headword">O'Brien, Sir  Lucius Henry</span>, third baronet  (1733&#150;1795), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 September 1733, in Dromoland, co. Clare, Ireland, a member of a younger branch of the O'Briens, earls of Thomond and of Inchiquin. He was the eldest son of Sir Edward O'Brien, second baronet (<i>d</i>. 1765), of Dromoland, politician, who represented County Clare in the Irish House of Commons for thirty years, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Hugh Hickman of Fenloe. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 9 July 1748, graduated BA in the spring of 1752, and, after entering the Middle Temple on 18 September 1753, was called to the Irish bar on 17 November 1758. He married, on 26 May 1768, Anne (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1798), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63658/', "Robert French (1716&#150;1779)")</script>, the prominent patriot MP of Monivae, co. Galway, and his wife, Nicola Acheson (<i>d</i>. 1762). They had six daughters and five sons.<br>
<br>O'Brien entered parliament in 1763 as member for Ennis borough and in the same year announced his arrival with a long speech in a debate over tithes, in which he described the condition of the country, which was subsequently quoted by Lecky in his <span class="italic">History of England</span>. He became friends with Charles Lucas, the patriot MP, and soon became a prominent member of the parliamentary opposition. According to Barrington:<blockquote>By means of a rational understanding and very extensive and accurate commercial information he acquired a considerable degree of public reputation, though his language was bad&#151;his address miserable and his figure and action unmeaning and whimsical&#151;yet, as his matter was generally good, his reasoning sound, and his conduct frequently spirited and independent, he was attended to with respect, and in return always conveyed considerable information. (Barrington, 1.213&#150;14)</blockquote>In 1765 O'Brien succeeded his father as third baronet; in March of the following year he was placed at the head of a committee to prepare and introduce a bill making the judges' offices tenable <i>quamdiu se bene gesserint</i>, and not as previously in Ireland during the king's pleasure. The bill was passed, being a popular opposition measure, but did not receive the assent of the English privy council until 1782. In 1768 O'Brien contested his father's seat, County Clare, at the cost of &pound;2000; he was elected, and represented the county until 1776, when he was returned for Ennis. When, however, Hugh Dillon Massy, one of the members for County Clare, was unseated O'Brien was returned in his stead and chose to sit for the county.<br>
<br>O'Brien busied himself with endeavours to remove the restrictions on trade between England and Ireland, and made frequent speeches on the subject in parliament in opposition to the government; but his speeches lacked lucidity, and his audience was said to be seldom the wiser for them. He visited England in 1778&#150;9 in pursuance of the same object. In the same year he reported to the lord lieutenant on the state of co. Clare, and was one of the first to urge the arming of the militia to meet the expected invasion of Ireland. Following the lead of Charlemont, he headed the volunteer movement in co. Clare, though somewhat reluctantly given the weakness of protestant numbers in the county, and took an active part in the agitation for Irish legislative independence. In 1780 he led the opposition to the government in the matter of the import duties between Portugal and Ireland, and in 1782 he supported Grattan's motion for an address to the king in favour of legislative independence. He was never a fully devoted member of Grattan's patriots and instead concentrated his energies on economic improvement both on his debt-ridden estate and in the surrounding counties through the medium of internal navigation. Like Robert French, his patriotism was much more of the economic than the constitutional kind, which made him a potential government supporter and also a rather old-fashioned kind of country gentleman when in opposition.<br>
<br>Perhaps because of limited advocacy of the popular cause, O'Brien was defeated at County Clare in 1783 by a leading county volunteer; he was, however, returned for a purchased seat in Tuam, which he represented until 1790. In 1787 he was sworn of the privy council and appointed clerk of the crown and hanaper in the high court of chancery. He was regarded as a supporter, if a somewhat unreliable one, of the government. He took a prominent part in the debates on Pitt's proposals for removing the restrictions on Irish trade, and also on the regency question of 1788, and in both cases took the patriot side. In 1790 he was returned for Ennis, and he represented it until his death. In 1791 he moved a resolution for the more satisfactory trying of election petitions, and his last recorded speech in parliament was made in March of the same year on the subject of India trade. Arthur Young acknowledged his indebtedness to O'Brien, at whose house he stayed, and who was indefatigable in procuring materials for Young's <span class="italic">Tour in Ireland</span>. O'Brien died on 15 January 1795 at Dromoland, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward O'Brien, fourth baronet (1773&#150;1837), who was the father of William Smith O'Brien (1803&#150;1864), Irish nationalist, and Edward O'Brien (1808&#150;1840), author.<br>
