<span class="headword">Hume <span class="st"> [Home]</span>,  George</span>, fourth Lord Hume  (<em>d.</em> 1549), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13635/', "Alexander Hume, third Lord Hume (d. 1516)")</script>, and son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13634/', "Alexander Hume, second Lord Hume (d. 1506)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54234/', "Hume family")</script>], and his second wife, Nichola Ker of Samuelston. George was restored to his family titles and estates in August 1522, which was not ratified by parliament until 1526. About 1518 he married Mariota Haliburton of Dirleton, coheir of Patrick Haliburton, Lord Haliburton, which brought a third of the lucrative Dirleton estates in Haddingtonshire into Hume ownership. They had three sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13636/', "Alexander Home, fifth Lord Home")</script>, Andrew, commendator of Jedburgh Abbey, and Matthew Hume of Cloichtow. Their daughter Margaret married Alexander Erskine of Gogar and was mother of Thomas Erskine, first earl of Kellie. Hume also had an illegitimate son, George.<br>
<br>The power vacuum left by the downfall of the third Lord Hume, executed for treason in 1516, caused unrest in the Scottish east march. Anthoine de Labastie, acting warden of the march, was murdered by the Humes in 1517. An accomplice to this deadly act (Labastie had been exulting in the third lord's downfall), George was denounced a traitor, yet after being offered amnesty in March 1518 he surrendered himself in order to save his life and protect his wife's heritage. He had no other lands at this time, as his brother's forfeiture was still in force. Hume Castle in Berwickshire, for example, was in the custody of Sir James Hamilton of Finnart. He did not regain his family's estates at Hume and Dunglass, Haddingtonshire, until 1522 and had to claim back other lands at Greenlaw, Leitholm, and Birgham in 1524.<br>
<br>In July 1520 Hume came to Edinburgh with others in order to reclaim the honour of his family. One account states that they proceeded to the Tolbooth and removed the heads of the third lord and his brother William. Later they held a proper funeral for them at the Blackfriars with &#145;greit offeringis and banquets&#146;, before returning home  (Lesley, 115&#150;16). Another account states that it was the eighteenth earl of Angus who ordered the heads to be removed and delivered to George. Either way this action symbolized the Humes' recovery, underlined when on 12 August 1522 George Hume was restored to his brother's peerage title. During that summer he was praised by Henry VIII for opposing the regent, the fourth duke of Albany, in the name of the young James V. When Albany left Scotland in 1524 the Humes soon fell out with Angus, who succeeded him, resenting the new regent's predominance in the borders. In May 1526 Hume's failure to support Angus led to his being charged with treason, and though a temporary reconciliation followed, with Hume signing a bond of manrent with Angus on 20 June, he later backed the king against the regent. This brought instability to the borders, but strengthened Hume's position during the period 1526&#150;8. He was thanked for preserving the king from Scott of Buccleuch's kidnap attempt in 1526, during which Andrew Ker of Cessford was slain, and he gained from the downfall of Angus in 1528, replacing the earl as warden of the east march.<br>
<br>Hume held that office during the periods 1528&#150;32, 1535&#150;8, 1542&#150;3, and 1546&#150;7, and his deputies were normally his kinsmen. He was displaced only when a higher ranking lieutenant or warden-general was appointed by the crown&#151;magnates such as the earls of Angus, Lennox, or Moray. In 1529, moreover, he was appointed royal lieutenant within the bounds of the Merse, Lauderdale, Teviotdale, Haddingtonshire, and Lammermuir to preserve peace and resist rebels. He was occasionally called to the court to account for border affairs and like other wardens he was warded by the king in 1530 as part of James's programme of strengthening his own authority on the marches. None the less, he was later said to have done good service during the brief Anglo-Scottish war of 1532&#150;3.<br>
<br>The strategic position of Hume Castle in the east marches made it an obvious target for invading English armies. The Scots army lay at Hume Castle, with all the gentlemen of the Merse, just before the battle of Solway Moss in 1542. The following year Hume was described by Sir William Parr as &#145;a man of a precise, obstinate and froward nature &hellip; very unmeet for his office [wardenship]&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 18/1, no. 592), a hostile view reflecting the fact that he was now a supporter of the pro-French party in Scotland, led by Cardinal Beaton. This guaranteed him French money to defend Hume Castle, but it also led to the deliberate targeting of his property by English raiders. Hume retaliated by attacking settlements in the English east march. However, in May 1544 he could not stop the retreating English army, led by the earl of Hertford, from passing through the strategic pass of Pease near Dunglass.<br>
<br>The Humes were staunch supporters of the Franco-Scottish alliance throughout the 1540s, fighting against the English at Ancrum Moor in 1545, but they paid a heavy price for their loyalty as Lord Hume had &#145;no goods left undestroyed&#146; by the end of 1545  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 20/2, no. 1009). The compensation that he received from both the Scottish privy council and France could never equal all that he and his kinsmen lost at this time. His family's situation appeared gravest by the autumn of 1547, when French help was expected but did not come. Hume broke his collar bone during a skirmish at Fawside, two days before the battle of Pinkie. The subsequent defeat of the Scots, on 10 September 1547, and the capture of the master of Hume probably led to Lady Hume giving some assurance to Protector Somerset (formerly Hertford) without her husband's knowledge. In a letter to Somerset she wrote with appropriate discretion: &#145;I dare not let my lord my husband see your last writing about the rendering of Home and the pledges&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1547&#150;63</i>, 36). This may be why Hume Castle capitulated with suspicious ease in 1547, even though Hume had been promised &pound;1845 to pay for horsemen, gunners, and victuals there. When French forces finally arrived in 1548 they reconquered southern Scotland, including Hume Castle. When Lord Home died in 1549 he had the satisfaction of knowing that Hume was safe and that his son and heir was back in Scotland.<br>
