<span class="headword">Currie, Sir  William Crawford</span>  (1884&#150;1961), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born in Calcutta on 4 May 1884, the elder son of William Currie, East India merchant of Glasgow and Calcutta, and his wife, Jessie, also of Scotland. Currie's father was senior partner in Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co., managing agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company (BISN), and kinsman of its founder, William Mackinnon.<br>
<br>Currie was educated at the Glasgow Academy, Fettes College in Edinburgh, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a rugby blue and a certificate from the Royal Humane Society (1904) for saving a child from drowning. After graduating in history (1905), he gained qualification as an accountant in Glasgow and left for Calcutta (1910) to join his father in Mackinnons. In 1914 Currie married Ruth Forrest, daughter of C. S. Dods of Edinburgh. They had two sons; the elder was killed in action in Burma in 1944.<br>
<br>A partner in 1918, Currie took his father's place as senior partner in 1922 and began to take a prominent part in public life in India. Sheriff of Calcutta in 1921&#150;2, he sat on the Bengal legislative council (1921&#150;5) and in 1924 was elected president of both the Bengal chamber of commerce and the Associated Chambers of Commerce of India, Burma, and Ceylon. In 1925, during his last year in the east, he was appointed a member of the council of state for India and received a knighthood for his services.<br>
<br>Currie returned to London to become a partner of Gray Dawes &amp; Co., agents of BISN, and was soon immersed in shipping affairs. He was appointed to the Imperial Shipping Committee (1926&#150;30) and elected president of the chamber of shipping of the United Kingdom (1929&#150;30).<br>
<br>In 1932 Alexander Shaw (later Lord Craigmyle), who had become chairman of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P. &amp; O.) and BISN because of the serious illness of James Lyle Mackay, first earl of Inchcape, invited Currie to join P. &amp; O. as deputy chairman and managing director; in 1938 he was elected chairman in succession to Craigmyle.<br>
<br>While keeping in close touch with the affairs of the P. &amp; O. group in the Second World War, Currie was a member of the advisory council of the Ministry of War Transport throughout the war and became director of the liner division at the ministry (1942&#150;5). He was also on the executive committee of the Red Cross Society and order of St John (1942&#150;7), and a member of the Red Cross Prisoners-of-War committee (1943&#150;6). His war service was recognized by a GBE (1947) and by France with the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1953).<br>
<br>After the war Currie had the major task, under very difficult conditions, of repairing damage and replacing losses sustained by the P. &amp; O. group's fleets. His quick success in this mammoth undertaking showed the measure of his power and determination. Currie also had to deal with revolutionary changes in the structure of the P. &amp; O. group brought about by the transfer of power in India; and as a trustee and partner in Mackinnons, he had to make new arrangements for the agency: it was reorganized as Inchcape &amp; Co. Ltd with himself as a director.<br>
<br>During these crowded and anxious years, Currie found time to become president of the Institute of Marine Engineers (1945&#150;6), chairman of the British Liner committee (1946&#150;8), prime warden of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights (1949), and a member of the Commonwealth Shipping Committee. Among a multitude of business interests he was deputy chairman of the Williams Deacon's Bank, extraordinary director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, chairman of the Marine and General Mutual Life Assurance Society, and director of the Suez Finance Company and the Southern Railway. Other activities included a year as high sheriff of Buckinghamshire (1947), president of the Seafarers' Education Service, chairman of the committee of management of the training ship <i>Worcester</i>, a trustee of the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, member of the council of King George's Fund for Sailors, an honorary member of the Company of Master Mariners, and honorary captain, Royal Naval Reserve.<br>
<br>Currie had none of the arrogance of a &#145;City tycoon&#146;. Short and stocky, he was a man of great modesty, winning charm, and innate kindliness. He led by persuasion and example and made friends everywhere. In the P. &amp; O. company, he had the respect, devotion, and affection of all grades of employees on land and at sea, British and Indian; in return he knew them by name, and wrote notes of thanks or appreciation in his own hand. Called Sir Willy, he was genuinely loved in the company and esteemed in the shipping industry at large. In his seventies he found it hard to keep up with the momentum of change. He belonged to the pre-war world, and his retirement in 1960 was not before time.<br>
<br>A keen sportsman in his younger days, he continued to hunt and shoot whenever he had the time. His home was Dinton Hall in Aylesbury. Currie died on 3 July 1961 at Aylesbury. He was survived by his wife.<br>
