<span class="headword">Ostorius Scapula,  Publius</span>  (<em>d.</em> <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 52), <span class="occ">Roman governor of Britain</span>, died in the province. His date of birth is unknown, but was probably about 1 <span class="smallcap">BC</span> at the earliest. His father, of the same names as himself, was a high-ranking Roman knight, who became prefect of Egypt in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 10. His mother was perhaps called Sallustia Calvina. An uncle, Quintus Ostorius Scapula, was one of the first two prefects of the praetorian guard (2 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>). Scapula's son Marcus served in Britain under his father and became consul in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 59. A grandson, also called Marcus, was proconsul of Asia in 114&#150;15. The family had estates in northern Italy, perhaps near Novaria (Novara), but probably derived from central or eastern Italy.<br>
<br>Scapula arrived in Britain to take up his command as the second Roman governor of Britain late in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 47 and had to take rapid action against free Britons who had attacked the province (between the Trent and Severn). In order to secure his rear, Scapula now ordered the surrender of weapons by the peoples under Roman control. This provoked a revolt by the Iceni of what is now East Anglia, who enjoyed the status of a client kingdom; they were joined by neighbouring peoples. Scapula's son won the highest Roman distinction for valour during the ensuing campaign. In <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 49 Scapula campaigned in north Wales against the Deceangli, reaching the Irish Sea, but failing to bring the enemy to a pitched battle. He had to abandon the campaign in order to suppress an anti-Roman movement in the client state of the Brigantes, who occupied most of what is now northern England. During the following year, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 50, he attempted to subdue the Silures of south Wales, who were now led by the surviving British leader from the time of the Roman invasion, Caratacus. Again, Scapula's success was limited, and Caratacus escaped north to the Ordovices of Snowdonia. During this period Scapula transferred one, or two, of his four legions from Camulodunum (Colchester) to the frontier region, one new base being Viroconium (Wroxeter). The vacated fortress at Camulodunum was now turned into a <i>colonia</i> (a chartered new town for the settlement of retired veteran legionaries).<br>
<br>During <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 51, in the course of a campaign against the Ordovices, Scapula finally brought Caratacus to battle, somewhere in north Wales, and achieved a decisive victory. Caratacus fled to the Brigantes, but the Brigantian ruler, Queen Cartimandua, remained loyal to Rome and handed Caratacus over. He was sent with his wife, daughter, and brothers to Rome, where Claudius displayed them in a victory ceremony. Scapula was rewarded by an honorary triumph. Despite this success, British resistance continued, with the Silures wiping out several legionary cohorts which were engaged in building forts. Scapula took immediate steps and proclaimed his intention to &#145;extinguish the name of the Silures&#146;  (Tacitus, <span class="italic">Annals</span>, xii.39). But in the same year, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 52, he died at his post, &#145;wearied by the irksomeness of his task&#146;  (ibid.), as Tacitus put it, at the end of his lengthy account of Scapula's governorship (he had already given a brief summary in the <span class="italic">Agricola</span>). Later in the <span class="italic">Annals</span> Tacitus also describes the murder of Scapula's son Marcus at the hands of Nero's assassins in <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 66.<br>
