<span class="headword">Maxwell,  John</span>, ninth Lord Maxwell  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1586, <em>d.</em> 1613), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18404/', "John Maxwell, earl of Morton and eighth Lord Maxwell (1553&#150;1593)")</script>, and Lady Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1568&#150;1637), daughter of David Douglas, seventh earl of Angus. He was placed under the guardianship of his father's cousin William Maxwell, fifth Lord Herries, and appears to have been brought up in Edinburgh. He was served heir to his father on 10 March 1597 and on 9 August that year he married Lady Margaret (<i>c</i>.1580&#150;<i>c</i>.1608), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12103/', "John Hamilton, first marquess of Hamilton (1539/40&#150;1604)")</script>. The couple had one son (who died young) but by 1601 were estranged. Several years later Margaret Hamilton died during divorce proceedings (instigated by Maxwell).<br>
<br>One of the most prominent landholders in the south-west of Scotland, Maxwell inherited a long-running feud with the Johnstone family, particularly significant as a result of the killing of his father by James Johnstone at the battle of Dryfesdale Sands. On 22 March 1599 Maxwell's father-in-law undertook a &pound;5000 bond to ensure that Maxwell did not enter Nithsdale to confront Johnstone. In spite of this, on 15 September the privy council decided that Maxwell would be controlled better under ward in Edinburgh Castle. Maxwell was not warded as he failed to attend the council in November (and again the next June). Consequently, he was denounced as a rebel. In July 1600 a further caution for &pound;10,000 was lodged for Maxwell not to enter Annandale, Nithsdale, or Galloway but to reside at the house of Hamilton. On 16 July 1601 he again endured warding in Edinburgh Castle but on 12 January 1602 he escaped. In February 1602 the Johnstone&#150;Maxwell feud was heightened when Maxwell attacked and killed William Johnstone of Eschieshiels. Then, as James Johnstone of Briggs took shelter in the house of James Bratten at Dalfibble, Maxwell burnt him alive. The feud continued intermittently but was seemingly reconciled before the privy council in June 1605, when Maxwell issued a &#145;letter of slains&#146; forgiving his father's killer (now styled Sir James Johnstone of Dunskellie) for his part in the murder.<br>
<br>Maxwell also feuded with the Douglas earls of Morton, who he felt had deprived him of his right to be earl of Morton in succession to his father. Within Dumfriesshire, Maxwell did hold local courts using the style &#145;earl of Morton&#146; but he was never formally recognized as such by the government. As Lord Maxwell he attended the parliaments of March and May 1606 but in the intervening period the privy council had to intervene to prevent him duelling with William Douglas, heir to the laird of Drumlanrig. On 23 May 1607 Maxwell and Morton subscribed a band that there was no feud existing between them but on 8 August Maxwell was again denounced rebel for challenging Morton over his title. On 24 September he was placed back under ward in Edinburgh Castle and on 4 December, with the assistance of fellow inmate James McConnell, he escaped from the castle for a second time. Two weeks later he was again denounced rebel.<br>
<br>Maxwell was regularly out of favour with the central government because of both his volatility and his Catholicism. While in ward for the first time in Edinburgh Castle he was attended by a minister in an (unsuccessful) attempt to convert him to protestantism. In December 1606 a convention of the clergy again suggested that Maxwell undertake instruction in the reformed faith and he was warded in Leith for his beliefs. On 12 January 1608 a summons of forfeiture was issued against him. Despite strenuous efforts to capture him, he remained at large in Dumfriesshire but in April 1608 arranged to meet the laird of Johnstone finally to settle their differences. During the conference a quarrel erupted between the servants of the men and, when Johnstone attempted to find out the cause, Maxwell shot him in the back. On 28 April a proclamation was issued to capture him dead or alive. Thereafter he fled to France. In his absence, he was found guilty in parliament of three counts of treason, the murder of two Johnstones (in 1602), the breaking of ward from Edinburgh Castle in 1607, and the murder under trust of Johnstone in 1608. He was condemned to death and forfeiture of his estates and honours.<br>
<br>In March 1612 Maxwell returned to Scotland under the protection of George, fifth earl of Caithness. The government reissued warrants for his capture and in September he was arrested in Caithness. He was transferred to prison in Edinburgh Castle and on 10 May 1613 an order was passed in council to carry out the previously agreed sentence. On 21 May, at the Market Cross of Edinburgh, he was beheaded. Thereafter his body was removed by Mark Ker and buried at Newbattle Abbey. Five years later his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67520/', "Robert Maxwell (b. after 1586, d. 1646)")</script> was restored to the Maxwell peerage.<br>
