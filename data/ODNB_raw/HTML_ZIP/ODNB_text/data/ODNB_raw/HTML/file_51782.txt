<span class="headword">Phipps,  Emily Frost</span>  (1865&#150;1943), <span class="occ">feminist and headmistress</span>, was born on 7 November 1865 at 9 South Hill Buildings, Stoke Damerel, Devonport, Devon, the daughter of Henry John Phipps, coppersmith at Devonport Dockyard, and his wife, Mary Ann, formerly Frost. She had a brother and a sister. On leaving elementary school she became a pupil teacher in an elementary infants' school and studied in the evenings to gain entrance to Homerton Training College, Cambridge. After a successful training she was appointed to the headship of the infants' school attached to the college. She subsequently returned to Devonport and worked at a larger infants' and then a new higher grade school, while studying for an external degree in Latin and Greek from London University. Having obtained a first class degree she was appointed headteacher of Swansea higher grade school, which she shortly succeeded in transforming into an excellent secondary school. Describing the school as one of the best in Wales, the Board of Education inspectors attributed this to the influence of Emily Phipps's strong character and personality, epitomized by thoroughness, enthusiasm, and hard work.<br>
<br>Emily Phipps, with her lifelong friend, Clare Neal, joined the Women's Freedom League in 1908, outraged by Lloyd George's anti-suffrage behaviour at a meeting they had attended in Swansea. They established a branch in Swansea and carried out indoor and outdoor speaking for the suffrage. On census night in 1911 Emily Phipps participated in the suffrage boycott by sleeping overnight with friends in a cave on the Gower coast. Her feminism and sense of justice led her to join the feminist National Federation of Women Teachers (NFWT), which was then a pressure group inside the National Union of Teachers (NUT). Within the NUT she campaigned for the union to support the franchise for women, equal pay for women teachers, and equality of opportunity for girls' education. While president of the Swansea NUT she led deputations to Swansea education committee on equal pay. She stood for the national executive of the NUT and was successful in 1915. She advised members, however, not to vote for her on a subsequent occasion because her position on equal pay was at variance with the policy of the NUT executive, which she described as a &#145;monstrous injustice to women&#146;  (<span class="italic">Schoolmaster</span>, 10 March 1917, 310). She campaigned successfully inside the federation for members to leave the NUT and to turn the federation into an autonomous feminist union.<br>
<br>Emily Phipps was elected president of the NFWT for three successive years, between 1915 and 1917, and was a central council member from 1913 to 1937. With Agnes Dawson she was a joint trustee of the National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) from 1918 to 1937. She became the first editor of the NUWT's journal, <span class="italic">Woman Teacher</span>, from 1919 to 1930 and was responsible for its lively, polemical, and contentious tone. As she stated in the first editorial, there would be no column for fashions or cookery: &#145;There will be too much propaganda for that&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman Teacher</span>, 26 Sept 1919, 1). In 1918 she was one of seventeen women parliamentary candidates in the first general election in which women could stand. In Chelsea she ran a whirlwind campaign as an independent candidate, with NFWT backing, against the Conservative Sir Samuel Hoare, obtaining 20.9 per cent of the vote and retaining her deposit. Although she was not satisfied with the performance of any political party as regards women, nevertheless, while she lived in Swansea she was an active member of the Swansea Women's Liberal Association.<br>
<br>While still a headteacher Emily Phipps studied in the evenings to become a barrister and was admitted to the bar in 1925, when she was nearly sixty. She resigned her headship, moved to London, and became the standing counsel for the NUWT while continuing to edit the <span class="italic">Woman Teacher</span> and to speak at public meetings and demonstrations throughout the country on equal rights. She wrote pamphlets for the NUWT on equality of opportunity and equal pay. In 1928 she wrote the first <span class="italic">History of the NUWT</span>. She maintained her allegiance to feminism and the Women's Freedom League throughout her life despite increasing ill health during the 1930s. She died of complications from a heart condition at her brother's home, Cremyll Cottage, Hermitage, near Newbury, Berkshire, on 3 May 1943. Characteristically her doctor was a woman.<br>
<br>Emily Phipps was renowned for her &#145;wonderful vitality&#146; attributed to her multitude of interests  (<span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, 19 Feb 1926, 175). As the NUWT obituary described it, &#145;There seemed to be nothing she could not do if she turned her attention to it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Woman Teacher</span>, 1943). She had a working knowledge of French, German, Italian, and Welsh. A contralto, she enjoyed part-singing, embroidery, reading, and gardening. Known for her sparkling personality, wit, and sharp tongue she inspired a generation of women teachers. Her belief was &#145;If you make yourself a door-mat do not be surprised if people tread on you&#146; and thus encouraged women to stand up for themselves with the NUWT motto &#145;Who would be free herself must strike the blow&#146;  (<span class="italic">Time and Tide</span>, 19 Feb 1926, 175). She was steadfast in her opposition to injustice to people and animals and was a strict vegetarian. She had a close friendship with Clare Neal (herself a president of the NUWT) until the latter's death in 1938, after which she lived with Adelaide Jones, the treasurer of the NUWT.<br>
<br>Emily Phipps was an important exponent of &#145;old feminism&#146; in the post-war period and seen by her contemporaries as a fine example of what women could aspire to in their careers and in politics. After her death, NUWT members described her as the one among their pioneers who, above all others, inspired them to want to take responsibility for women and to develop their powers and possibilities to the full.<br>
