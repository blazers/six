<span class="headword">Korner,  Alexis</span>  (1928&#150;1984), <span class="occ">blues singer and guitarist</span>, was born in Paris on 19 April 1928. His father was a former Austrian cavalry officer, and his mother was Greek. He was brought up in France, Switzerland, and north Africa. The family left France in 1940 in one of the last ships to leave the country during the Second World War and settled in London. Korner studied at St Paul's School and while there developed a keen interest in jazz and blues, mainly by way of gramophone records, with a special liking for the music of such pianists as Albert Ammons and Jimmy Yancey. He had learned the piano from the age of five but, with his growing interest in the blues, took to the guitar and did his utmost to emulate the American blues singers in spite of a current conviction in those days that it was essentially the province of black musicians. On leaving school he served for a while in the army, then had various short-lived jobs with a shipping firm, the BBC, and several record companies&#151;including Decca, where he worked in the catalogue section. Friendships formed at this time led to his contributing some valuable blues sections to <span class="italic">Jazz on Record</span> (1960) by Charles Fox, Peter Gammond, and Alun Morgan. In 1951 Korner married Roberta Melville, the daughter of the art critic <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/105468/', "Robert Melville")</script>; they had three children, Sappho, Nicholas, and Damian, and settled in a flat in Bayswater. Anyone who evinced any interest in the blues was invited to the flat for long and smoke-laden sessions at the turntable and was inevitably introduced to a lot of names on race record labels that were still unfamiliar to most people in Britain. When Big Bill Broonzy visited London in October 1955 (and recorded two albums for the Nixa label) he stayed at the Korners' home.<br>
<br>From 1948 to 1950 Korner led his own blues quartet, which played as an intermission group with Chris Barber in 1949. He was a member of Barber's skiffle group in 1952&#150;4 and recorded with Ken Colyer in 1954&#150;5 (including such works as &#145;Midnight Special&#146;). During the mid-fifties, in partnership with the harmonica player Cyril Davies (who died of leukaemia in 1963), he ran the Roundhouse Blues Club in an upstairs room above the pub in Brewer Street, where he not only supplied his own blues but also lured such prestigious guests as Muddy Waters, Sonny Terry, Jimmy Rushing, and Brownie McGhee. It was there that rhythm and blues first found an outlet in London. Korner and Davies founded the band Blues Incorporated in 1961 and in 1962, on St Patrick's day, opened the Ealing Rhythm and Blues Club in a basement beneath a cinema, which became their centre of operation. Other players included the saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith and the drummer Charlie Watts. Mick Jagger was in attendance and soon became a regular singer with the band, as did Brian Jones. The Rolling Stones was formed as a group to deputize for Blues Incorporated when the group was engaged elsewhere. As Blues Incorporated became better known it moved to the Marquee Club under the Academy Cinema, where it played a music that, as one obituary put it, &#145;merged Charlie Mingus with Muddy Waters&#146;. Musicians who played with the group during the next few years included Graham Bond, Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton, Paul Jones, John Mayall, Phil Seamen, Art Themen, and Danny Thompson, some making their first mark with the band. The LPs <span class="italic">R &amp; B from the Marquee</span>, <span class="italic">Red Hot from Alex</span>, <span class="italic">At the Cavern</span>, and <span class="italic">Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated</span> were recorded in 1962 and 1964 for Decca. Korner never sought popularity or played anything other than the music he believed in, which made him always a little ahead of his time and never <span class="italic">Top of the Pops</span> material. The strong jazz influence always remained as evident in his <span class="italic">Red Hot from Alex</span>, and his own liking was for guitarists like Lonnie Johnson and Big Bill Broonzy. He was hailed as the &#145;father of modern British rhythm and blues&#146;, though he strongly disclaimed any such distinction and amended it to &#145;grandfather&#146;, meanwhile steering clear of the excessive displays of the pop world, preferring a sustained family life, much of it spent in a converted Methodist chapel in Wales, and enthusiastic discourse with friends. He never became as famous or as rich as some of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, but earned the solid respect that he deserved.<br>
<br>Korner left the band in 1968 to work as a soloist; he recorded <span class="italic">I Wonder Who</span> (1967), <span class="italic">A New Generation of Blues</span>, and <span class="italic">Both Sides of Alexis Korner</span> (1969); then there were periods with the groups New Church (1969&#150;70), with whom he recorded, and CCS (1970&#150;73), featuring the singer Peter Thorup and Korner himself in some typical gruff vocals; and for a time he was resident bandleader for the children's television show <span class="italic">Five O'Clock Club</span>. In 1972 Korner and Thorup toured the USA with the group Humble Pie. This was followed by a fruitful musical partnership with the bass player Colin Hodgkinson from 1973 to 1980, during which he worked both in Britain and abroad, and always preferring the intimate live performance. Recordings from this period included <span class="italic">Mr Blues</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Alexis Korner</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Get off my Cloud</span> (1975), and <span class="italic">Just Easy</span> (1978). In the latter years much of his time was taken up by broadcasting, his BBC Radio 1 programme being a model of erudition, wit, and the well-turned phrase. He was an elegant writer and a man of great courtesy and charm. His gravelly voice was frequently used to good effect as the background to television commercials. He was always a smart dresser, a great connoisseur of food, drink, and art, and a keen follower of cricket and rugby, having played the latter in his early army days. His heavy smoking habits took their eventual toll, and he died of lung cancer in the Westminster Hospital, London, on 1 January 1984, aged fifty-five; he was survived by his wife. A number of compilations of his recordings appeared in the 1980s.<br>
