<span class="headword">Diamond,  Hugh Welch</span>  (1808&#150;1886), <span class="occ">photographer and asylum superintendent</span>, was born at Goudhurst, Kent, on 23 October 1808, the eldest son of William Batchelor Diamond, a surgeon in the East India Company, and his wife, Jane Welch. Diamond was educated at Norwich grammar school and from 1824 studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1828 he became a student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and was appointed pharmacist to the West Kent Infirmary at Maidstone. He married, on 14 June 1831, Jane Warwick (1810/11&#150;1850), and opened a private practice near Soho Square in London, where he treated the sick during the cholera outbreak of 1832, the year in which he was elected to the board of health. Two years later he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1846 he was elected fellow of the Medical Society of London.<br>
<br>Diamond was active in London antiquarian circles, and built up collections with a particular emphasis on ceramics and prints; in 1834 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries where he actively pursued his interest in the printing of images. In 1845 he began meeting with other &#145;gentleman amateurs&#146; interested in the early art of photography. The group became known as the Calotype Society, later referred to as the Photographic Club.<br>
<br>The period from 1848 to 1858 was crucial to Diamond's involvement with clinical psychiatry and photography. During the 1840s he became interested in the newly reformed treatment of the insane and in 1842 he began studying mental disease at Bethlem Hospital under Sir George Tuthill. In 1848 he was elected the residential superintendent of the female department of the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum at Springfield, where he remained until 1858. Following the death of his first wife, with whom he had three sons and three daughters, he married on 14 April 1851 Theresa Butler (1820/21&#150;1874).<br>
<br>During the 1850s Diamond published more than a dozen essays and notes on photography, including a series in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> in 1852, &#145;Photography applied to archaeology and practised in the open air&#146;. His paper delivered to the Photographic Society in 1853, &#145;The simplicity of the calotype process&#146;, popularized the calotype&#151;the earliest means of obtaining a positive image from a negative one&#151;among amateur photographers. He also contributed articles on photography to the <span class="italic">Photographic Journal</span>, published by the newly formed Photographic Society of London, established in 1853, of which he was a founder member. Within this society Diamond emerged as the dominant figure behind the formation of the Photographic Society Club, a dining club that met five times a year to discuss photographic matters. Between 1855 and 1858 Diamond also belonged to the Photographic Exchange Club, an organization that exchanged prints by post between its twenty-two members twice a year. In addition, he participated in discussions on the recording of antiquities by photography, and in 1854 was elected honorary photographer of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>It was his portraits of the insane that dominated reviews of Diamond's work throughout the decade, and for which he is best remembered. During the early 1850s he made many photographs of his insane patients using Frederick Scott Archer's collodion process. Archer, inventor of the wet collodion process in photography, communicated the results of his experiments with the collodion process to Diamond in 1850. One of the advantages of the collodion process over the calotype process was its shorter exposure time, which made it easier to photograph human subjects. In 1852 Diamond presented a series, &#145;The types of insanity&#146;, at the first exhibition of photography at the Society of Arts. These portraits were the first systematic use of photography in the history of psychiatry. In a paper read to the Royal Society in 1856, outlining his theories of the use of photography in psychiatry, &#145;On the application of photography to the physiognomy and mental phenomena of insanity&#146;, Diamond argued that photography had three important functions in the treatment of the insane: as a method of recording physiognomies of the mentally ill for study, of treating the mentally ill through the presentation of an accurate self-image, and of documenting the faces of patients to facilitate identification for later readmission and treatment. In 1858 Diamond's photographs of 1852 inspired a major series of essays by John Conolly, professor of medicine at the University of London, &#145;The physiognomy of insanity&#146;, including engravings made from Diamond's photographs. Identified by the noted pictorial photographer H. P. Robinson as the central figure in mid-nineteenth-century photography in Britain, Diamond was credited by his contemporaries with fostering the collection of medical photographs in British medical museums and schools during the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>Following an incident involving the accidental death of a patient in 1856 Diamond resigned his position at the Surrey County Asylum and moved to Twickenham, where he established a private asylum for female patients. During the late 1850s and 1860s Diamond was active in the Photographic Society, editing its journal from 1859 to 1869, serving as its secretary for this period and later as one of its vice-presidents, but he discontinued his practice of photographing inmates around this time. In 1858 he was elected to two Photographic Society committees, one to form a collection of photographs illustrating the progress of photographic science, the other to investigate the subject of copyright. In 1867 he served on the board of jurors for photography during the Paris Exhibition and in that year was awarded the medal for excellence from the Photographic Society. Diamond acquired a reputation as a genial host and a diverse collector. After his second wife's death he was cared for by his daughter Terasa. For many years he held weekly gatherings of literary, antiquarian, photographic, and artistic friends at his home and until his death he continued to entertain at his home, Twickenham House, where he died on 21 June 1886. He was buried in Twickenham cemetery.<br>
