<span class="headword">Osborn,  Sherard</span>  (1822&#150;1875), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, son of Colonel Edward Osborn of the Madras army, was born on 25 April 1822. In September 1837 he was entered by Commander William Warren as a first-class volunteer on board the sloop <i>Hyacinth</i>, fitting for the East Indies. The <i>Hyacinth</i> arrived at Singapore in May 1838, and in September was ordered to blockade Kedah, then in a state of revolt. Osborn was appointed to command a tender and so from December 1838 to March 1839 he was &#145;captain of his own ship&#146;. The responsibility thrust on him at such an early age went far to strengthen and mature his character. Parts of his journal during the time were published in 1857 as <span class="italic">Quedah, or, Stray Leaves from a Journal in Malayan Waters</span>. In 1840 the <i>Hyacinth</i> went to China, and took part in the operations in the Canton River. In 1842 Osborn was moved into the <i>Clio</i> with Commander Troubridge, and in her was present at the capture of Woosung (Wusong) on 16 June. He was afterwards transferred to the <i>Volage</i>, and came home in the <i>Columbine</i> in 1843. He passed his examination in December, and, after going through the gunnery course in the <i>Excellent</i>, was appointed gunnery mate of the <i>Collingwood</i>, fitting out for the Pacific as flagship of Sir George Seymour.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1846 Osborn was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Collingwood</i>, in which he returned to England in the summer of 1848. He then had command of the <i>Dwarf</i>, a small screw-steamer, employed during the disturbances of the year on the coast of Ireland. In 1849, when public attention was turned to the fate of Sir John Franklin, Osborn entered into the question with enthusiasm and energy, and in 1850 was appointed to command the steam tender <i>Pioneer</i>, in the Arctic expedition under Captain Austin in the <i>Resolute</i>. Considered as a surveying expedition, it was eminently successful, and proved that Franklin's ships had not been lost in Baffin's Bay. Much of the success of the voyage was due to the steam tenders, which, during the summers of 1850 and 1851, held out new prospects for Arctic navigation. The way in which the <i>Pioneer</i> or <i>Intrepid</i> cut through rotten ice, or steamed through the loose pack in a calm, led directly to the employment of powerful screw-steamers in the whaling fleet. On his return to England in 1851, Osborn urged the renewal of the search for Franklin.<br>
<br>Osborn married, in January 1852, Helen, daughter of John Hinksman of Queen Anne Street, London, who survived him; they had two daughters. In February 1852 he published an account of the two previous years' work, <span class="italic">Stray Leaves from an Arctic Journal</span>, which further stimulated public interest; and early in the year he joined another expedition under Sir Edward Belcher in the <i>Assistance</i>, Osborn again going in command of the <i>Pioneer</i>, to which he was formally promoted on 30 October. By what Osborn considered a most serious error of judgement, the <i>Pioneer</i>, with the other ships of the expedition, was abandoned on 20 August 1854, the officers and men being brought to England on 28 September. His Arctic service, including five summers and three winters, had severely tried Osborn's health, and for some time he had charge of the coastguard in Norfolk.<br>
<br>Early in 1855 Osborn was sent out to take command of the <i>Vesuvius</i> in the Black Sea, where he took part in the capture of Kerch, and, after the death of Captain Lyons, he remained as senior officer in the Sea of Azov, in command of a large squadron of gunboats, with which he destroyed many depots of provisions and stores destined for Sevastopol. On 18 August he was advanced to the rank of captain, but, by Sir Edmund Lyons's desire, was appointed to the <i>Medusa</i>, a small steamer, in which he remained as senior officer in the Sea of Azov until the conclusion of the war, for his conduct in which he received the CB, the cross of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and the Mejidiye of the fourth class. The occupation of the Sea of Azov destroyed the Russian logistics' support for its Crimean army, and led directly to the fall of Sevastopol. Osborn was consulted by the Admiralty on the strategy to be followed in 1856.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1857 Osborn was appointed to the paddle-frigate <i>Furious</i> and ordered to escort fifteen gunboats to China, a duty considered at the time one of serious difficulty. The gunboats, however, arrived safely at Hong Kong where they contributed to the success of the attack on Canton, in which Osborn was actively engaged. In December 1857 the <i>Furious</i> was appointed for the use of the plenipotentiary, Lord Elgin, and in the following year took him to Shanghai and the Gulf of Po Hai (Bohai). After the signing of the treaty of Tientsin, Lord Elgin, still in the <i>Furious</i>, went to Tokyo, where he concluded a treaty which largely opened Japan to relations with the West; and in September 1858 he went up the Yangtze (Yangzi) River as far as Hangchow (Hangzhou), a piece of difficult and intricate navigation.<br>
<br>In 1859 Osborn returned to England in bad health, and, while on leave, contributed many articles to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, mostly on naval or Chinese topics. In 1861 he was appointed to the <i>Donegal</i>, which he commanded in the Gulf of Mexico during the Mexican war, and was paid off in the beginning of 1862. In the following June he agreed to the Chinese government's request to take command of a squadron fitted out in England for the suppression of piracy on the Chinese coast. In 1863 he went out with six specially built steamers. It had been expressly stipulated that Osborn was to receive his orders from the imperial government alone, independent of the local authorities; but on his arrival in China he found that the government had determined that the squadron was to be under the command of the mandarins at the several ports. Osborn refused to accept this, resigned, and returned to England. In 1864 Osborn commanded the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, a ship fitted with turrets on the plan proposed by his friend Captain Cowper Phipps Coles. In this experimental command, Osborn demonstrated the value of the turret system of mounting heavy guns, and, despite his well-known connection with Coles, advised the Admiralty on the adoption of the system. The <i>Royal Sovereign</i> was the prototype of the first-class coast assault battleships which were a feature of the navy for the next thirty years. On the 1871 Admiralty committee on designs he stressed the need for first-class ships to be capable of breaking into defended bases, specifically Brest and Cherbourg.<br>
<br>In 1865 Osborn accepted an appointment as agent to the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the traffic organization of which he remodelled and improved. Ill health compelled him to resign in 1866, and in 1867 he became managing director of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, an office which he held until 1873. In 1871 he commanded the <i>Hercules</i> in the channel for a few months, and on 29 May 1873 attained the rank of rear-admiral. He continued to take great interest in Arctic exploration, and in 1873 suggested to Commander Albert Markham that he examine for himself the new conditions of the work under steam, which Markham did by a summer voyage in a whaler. Markham's favourable report strongly influenced public opinion. An expedition was determined on, and an advising committee of experts, of whom Osborn was one, was appointed. On Monday, 3 May 1875, when the ships were on the point of sailing, Osborn went down to Portsmouth to wish the officers farewell. He died suddenly at his home, 33 Charles Street, Berkeley Square, London, on 6 May, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on the 10th.<br>
<br>Osborn's more important works, including <span class="italic">The Discovery of a North-West Passage by Captain M'Clure</span>, <span class="italic">Arctic Journal</span>, and <span class="italic">Last Voyage and Fate of Sir John Franklin</span>, were published in a collective edition of three volumes in 1865. He also published many articles in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> and in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> or <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</span>. Osborn was an intelligent and resourceful officer, better suited to independent command than the restrictions of peacetime squadron service. He held strong views on a number of issues and was never behindhand in setting them before the public. His services in the Sea of Azov were the highlight of a brilliant, if unconventional, career, largely devoted to the projection of power from the sea against the shore.<br>
