<span class="headword">Bush,  Geoffrey</span>  (1920&#150;1998), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born on 23 March 1920 at 84 Strode Road, Kilburn, London, the son of Charles Christmas Bush, schoolmaster and author, and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chart. His parents separated soon after his birth, and he never saw his father again. Brought up by his mother, he was a chorister in Salisbury Cathedral (1928&#150;33), where under Walter Alcock he learned to admire the centuries-long tradition of English church music, and where the foundations of his enduring Christian faith were laid. At Lancing College (1933&#150;8) his early efforts at composition came under the critical discipline of Jasper Rooper. However, his real musical mentor was John Ireland, who helped to strengthen his sense of an English identity even when his interests broadened to include, especially, French and Russian music. In 1938 he went up on a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a second class in classical moderations and took his BMus in 1940; he was awarded the MA and DMus in 1946. While at Oxford he became a close friend of the composer Bruce Montgomery, already making a name for himself as a detective story writer under the name Edmund Crispin. Bush even lent a hand with a genre he always enjoyed, and earned a fleeting appearance in one of Montgomery's stories as a hard-pressed film composer. A pacifist, he spent the Second World War as assistant warden of a Welsh children's hostel before returning to Oxford.<br>
<br>Bush had continued to compose, and the first of his six operas, <span class="italic">The Spanish Rivals</span>, was produced at Brighton in 1948 and for the Festival of Britain in 1951. He meanwhile married, on 15 April 1950, Julie Kathleen McKenna (<i>b</i>. 1924/5), physiotherapist, daughter of Curtin McKenna, chartered secretary; they had two sons, Andrew and Paul. Bush's distinguished career as a teacher began with extra-mural lecturing in Oxford in 1947. In 1952 he moved to the extra-mural department of London University, where he remained in various capacities until 1987. He was also visiting professor at King's College, London, for twenty years from 1969. There he was a much admired lecturer, adept at conveying the importance of strict disciplines and serious ideas with the urbanity and wit that were also to make him a popular broadcaster.<br>
<br>Bush's first symphony had its premi&egrave;re at the 1954 Cheltenham festival, where a number of his works were played and where he was a familiar and popular figure. It includes a blues-influenced slow movement in memory of Constant Lambert, some of whose tastes Bush shared; he enjoyed jazz as well as American musicals. The same festival saw the premi&egrave;re of what was to be his most popular work, the overture <span class="italic">Yorick</span>, which had already won the 1949 Royal Philharmonic Society prize. A second symphony followed in 1957, but its neglect until a recording in 1994 contributed to his abandoning the form. In any case, some of his most characteristic music, in a long and wide-ranging list of works, was in smaller forms, and reflected the breadth but discrimination of his literary tastes. These included settings of Chaucer, Herrick, Shakespeare, Jonson, Shelley, Wilde, Kathleen Raine, and Stevie Smith, as well as medieval lyrics and modern limericks. His operas ranged from pacifist subjects, including <span class="italic">The Equation</span> (1967), a bleak work for the Sacred Music Drama Society, to <span class="italic">Lord Arthur Savile's Crime</span> (1972), a piece for students with a wealth of witty and sly musical allusions that well suit Wilde's story. He admitted to being happiest writing songs and operas, when he could find the right words.<br>
<br>Bush's championship of English music also took him to scholarly work: he edited several volumes of the series <span class="roman">Musica Britannica</span>, works by John Ireland and other English composers, among them Elgar, and an anthology of English song. He also served on the Composers' Guild of Great Britain, the Arts Council, and the Performing Right Society. He was made an honorary fellow of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 1986.<br>
<br>Though his music ranged wide and encompassed many forms, Bush's most characteristic works were shorter ones in which the lyrical qualities and directness of utterance he sought were most naturally realized. His books included a lively collection of essays, partly autobiographical, <span class="italic">An Unsentimental Education</span>. The appreciation and affection he enjoyed in the musical world were demonstrated at a seventieth birthday concert presented at the Wigmore Hall, London, by the Songmakers' Almanac, &#145;A celebration of English song, 1850&#150;1990&#146;, its title referring to a tradition to which he had made a valuable contribution. In person, he was a genial, bespectacled man, usually bow-tied, quick and intelligent in conversation, witty and far from uncritical about contemporary developments he deplored, but essentially kind and generous. He died at his home, 43 Corringham Road, Golders Green, London, on 24 February 1998, of prostate cancer. He was survived by his wife, Julie, and their two sons.<br>
