<span class="headword">Baillie <span class="st"> [Bailly]</span>,  Charles</span>  (<em>c.</em>1541&#150;1625), <span class="occ">conspirator and informer</span>, was probably born in the Low Countries of Scottish descent. He was a good linguist, and from about 1564 found employment in the household of Mary, queen of Scots. By 1571 he was in the service of John Leslie, bishop of Ross, who was the representative in London of the now imprisoned queen. Early in that year he was seized at Dover carrying a package of books and some letters, the latter tied close under his clothing against his back. It emerged that he had been sent by Leslie to the Spanish Netherlands, to pick up some copies of Leslie's seditious pamphlet <span class="italic">A Treatise Concerning Defence of the Honour of &hellip; Mary, Queen of Scotland</span>, which had been reprinted secretly at Li&egrave;ge, and that he had also carried abroad letters for various of the Catholic exiles there. When arrested he was returning from Brussels with a number of letters, including three highly dangerous ones from the Florentine banker and plotter Roberto Ridolfi, who was attempting to interest the duke of Alva in a plan to invade England, depose the queen, free Mary Stewart, and marry her to the duke of Norfolk. The three letters were addressed to Leslie, Norfolk, and Lord Lumley, and implicated them all in this plot.<br>
<br>The details of the events surrounding Baillie's arrest are controversial. Francis Edwards has argued that Lord Burghley knew in advance of this &#145;plot&#146;, and that Ridolfi was in the government's pay to entrap Norfolk and Queen Mary. The more straightforward and conventional interpretation (that of J. A. Froude and his successors) sees Ridolfi and Leslie as genuine, if foolish, conspirators, whose doings were uncovered first by Baillie's arrest, and then by some excellent detective work by Burghley. Initially Baillie's packet of letters was confiscated by Lord Cobham, lord warden of the Cinque Ports, who was minded to conceal this evidence which might harm his own brother and two important members of the nobility, and who passed the packet straight on to Leslie. Burghley set to work to discover the truth from Baillie, who was at first placed in the Marshalsea and then in the Tower. Burghley used well-tried techniques to break down the young Baillie, first by introducing informers into his prisons, one of whom set up lines of communication between Baillie and Leslie, which allowed Burghley to read all the letters between them. The rack was also employed, and confinement in Little Ease, a cell 4 feet square. As a result Baillie confessed as much as he knew, which was sufficient to see Leslie and Norfolk imprisoned, and which began the process that eventually led the latter to the block and threatened the life of Queen Mary. While he was in the Tower Baillie incised two inscriptions in the walls, signed with his name and dated 10 April and 10 September 1571 respectively. His use of the IHS monogram underlines his allegiance to Catholicism, while his use of French and Italian phrases points to his linguistic skills. Both graffiti moralize upon the predicament of their maker. In November 1572, however, Baillie was released, and was soon back in the Netherlands. He died at Hulpe, near Brussels, on 27 December 1625, in his eighty-fifth year, and was buried in the churchyard of Hulpe, where his gravestone was still visible in the nineteenth century, describing him as a secretary to the queen of Scots and a martyr for the Catholic faith.<br>
