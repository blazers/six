<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Xuma,  Alfred Bitini</span>  (1893&#150;1962), <span class="occ">politician and physician in South Africa</span>, was born at Manzana, Engcobo district, Thembuland, in the Transkei, Cape Colony, on 8 March 1893. He was the seventh child of the Wesleyan converts Abraham Mangali Xuma, farmer and lay preacher, and Elizabeth Cupase Xuma, farmer, neither of whom received formal schooling. He had a bucolic early childhood herding cattle but excelled at school, first at Manzana's Anglican mission school then at the nearby Clarkebury Institute, where he qualified in 1911 as a primary teacher but not before organizing a student strike against the gross inequalities in African education.<br>
<br>Xuma worked for two years as a teacher, saving much of the &pound;14 a term he earned to enable him to sail to the United States in 1913 to further his education. He stayed in America for thirteen years, working at many jobs to pay for his studies. He tasted the life of a labourer in coal yards, building sites, and stables; in a furnace &#145;ramming the steel pipe moulds&#146;; and as a domestic and cleaner. After studying initially at the Tuskegee Institute, Alabama (1914&#150;16), he eventually took degrees in science and medicine from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis (1920) and Northwestern University in Evanston (1926) respectively, having also spent a period (1921&#150;3) at Marquette University and the Lewis Institute, Chicago. He gained experience in obstetrics and gynaecology and surgery with residencies at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and at Pecs University and New St John's Hospital, Budapest, before travelling to Edinburgh in 1927, where he received the licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, qualifying him to practise medicine in the British empire.<br>
<br>After returning to South Africa in 1927 Xuma opened a medical practice that brought him a comfortable income. However, the depression and his practice and residence at Sophiatown in Johannesburg on the Witwatersrand, not far removed from thousands of toiling black workers, focused his attention on practical solutions to the problems of his fellow Africans who lacked socio-economic and political rights. Xuma opposed militant action but quickly embraced social reform. In detailed memoranda and evidence before government commissions he drew attention to the poor health, housing, and working conditions of Africans in places such as the crowded township of Alexandra, where he was part-time medical officer of health. In 1929 he urged the Miners' Phthisis Commission to rectify the lack of compensation for maimed African miners. Before the Native Economic Commission in 1931 he argued that pass laws limited Africans' bargaining power, and his 1932 address to the Bantu Social Club of the University of the Witwatersrand detailed high black infant mortality on the Rand.<br>
<br>Before 1935 Xuma remained aloof from African politics. In 1929 and 1930 he declined positions of leadership in the African National Congress (ANC), despite being elected <i>in absentia</i> to its executive. But after the government introduced the discriminatory Hertzog bills, he spoke out against the impending abolition of the Cape African franchise and in 1935 was elected vice-president of the All-African Convention. His staunch opposition to the purely advisory Natives' Representative Council further raised his profile. Xuma's political horizons widened during an extended visit to the United States and Britain in 1937&#150;8, during which he became the first African to receive the diploma of public health from the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. In London he interacted with African nationalist and pan-African leaders from many countries. Xuma returned to South Africa in 1938 as the ANC was starting to reorganize under its energetic secretary James Calata. Xuma now became more politically active and in December 1940 Congress delegates elected him ANC president-general by the narrowest of margins over the sitting president, Zaccheus Richard Mahabane.<br>
<br>Xuma's time as ANC leader was a period of transformation and steady growth. He introduced administrative reforms, encouraged mass membership, and began to consider passive resistance. The organization became more centralized and financially viable. Membership grew from about 1000 in the 1930s to 5517 by 1947. Xuma's ANC reforms included abolition of the upper house and equality for women. In 1941 Congress voted for equal membership rights for women, confirmed in a new ANC constitution adopted in 1943. Xuma's second wife, the African-American Madie Beatrice Hall (1894&#150;1982), whom he married on 18 May 1940 and who headed the revived ANC Women's League from 1943 to 1948, influenced these moves. (His first wife, the Liberian-born Amanda Priscilla Mason, whom he married on 29 October 1931, had died in 1934.)<br>
<br>During the Second World War Xuma gave qualified support to the war effort but argued that solutions to problems of land, wages, and pass laws should not await the end of hostilities. Influenced by the spirit of the Atlantic charter, he established a committee of Africans who co-wrote <span class="italic">Africans' Claims in South Africa</span> (1943), which called for peace, removal of colour bars, better African labour standards, the right of African self-determination, independence of all colonies, and no annexation by South Africa of British protectorates. In 1946 Xuma affirmed support at the United Nations for the anti-colonial struggle in South-West Africa (Namibia). In this period he also forged an alliance with the South African Indian Congress, agreeing a joint declaration of co-operation with Dr Yusuf Dadoo of the Transvaal Indian Congress and Dr G. M. Naicker of the Natal Indian Congress (the &#145;three doctors' pact&#146;). He worked closely with both moderate and radical ANC members. Despite Xuma's disdain for strikes, he made submissions to the Smit and Lansdowne commissions arguing for legal recognition of African trade unions, and in 1946 denounced harsh state repression of a major African miners' strike.<br>
<br>Often seen as lacking the common touch, Xuma shied away from mass action. Yet he articulated reformist values and prefigured black consciousness with a call to the 1944 ANC conference for Africans to develop race pride. In the same year he gave tacit support to such young radicals as Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo to form the Congress Youth League, whose radicalism eventually undermined his position after the victory in the 1948 elections of the National Party and its promotion of apartheid pushed the ANC to adopt a radical programme of action, including strikes and boycotts. Frustration at the apparent failure of his constitutional methods grew, and he was defeated in 1949 as ANC president by the Youth League's candidate, James Sebe Moroka.<br>
<br>Xuma resigned from the ANC executive and henceforth played no major role in national politics. He criticized the ANC civil disobedience campaigns of the 1950s but he did organize his fellow Sophiatown residents against forced removals, and continued to make personal interventions for moderate change. Under the government's resettlement scheme he was forced to sell his house, 85 Toby Street, Sophiatown, to a white purchaser, and was obliged to move to 1401 Mtipa Street, Dube, Soweto, an area where black residents were permitted to live under the <span class="roman">Group Areas Act</span>. He died there on 27 January 1962, and was buried in Brixton cemetery, Johannesburg, on 1 February.<br>
<br>Xuma was a major figure in African politics in South Africa throughout the 1940s. His unswerving support for African rights and refusal to accept government tokenism gave him a reputation for steadfastness underscored by his hard work in building a stronger ANC. His years in America gave Xuma wide contacts among African-American and church circles that helped him consolidate his social position. British influences of liberalism, education, and culture were still dominant in South Africa and if Xuma's visits to Britain were less extensive, they nevertheless also provided contacts with South African liberals and African nationalists. He espoused a combination of African nationalist, Christian, liberal, and social democratic philosophies. While he failed to adjust to change after 1948, his legacy was a revived ANC; his hard work ironically placed it on the road to the militant resistance that materialized in the 1950s, even if he did not himself take this road.<br>
