<span class="headword">Jarmay, Sir  John Gustav</span>  (1856&#150;1944), <span class="occ">industrial chemist</span>, was born on 31 December 1856, the son of Gustav de J&aacute;rmay, a pharmacist of Pest, Hungary. He was educated at private schools in Hungary and at the Technische Hochschule in Z&uuml;rich, where he had the good fortune to be a pupil of Georg Lunge. Although Lunge inspired many chemists who later became distinguished in theoretical fields, he was experienced in the chemical industry as well, having spent a long time in England in work connected with alkali manufacture. Jarmay followed his example and came early to England, to study for a while in Manchester. There he came to the notice of H. E. Roscoe, whom Lunge had known. Like Lunge, Roscoe saw the need to promote scientifically trained men into the chemical industry and he encouraged Jarmay to take the first step on his long industrial career with Greenall, Whitley &amp; Co., brewers of Warrington. Two years later Jarmay began a connection with Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. which was to last the rest of his active life. This leading enterprise had been set up by John Tomlinson Brunner and Ludwig Mond in 1873, becoming a limited company in 1881. Like other British chemical companies it had often to recruit foreign chemists; Brunner admired Roscoe's work, and encouraged his students, so Jarmay had a double virtue in his eyes. He became a manager for the company at Winnington in 1880. On 2 June 1882 Jarmay married Charlotte Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1938), daughter of George Wyman, a surgeon. She was very active in the work of the Red Cross in Cheshire during the First World War and was made an OBE in 1919. They had one son, who became a farmer.<br>
<br>The key to Jarmay's success was the ammonia-soda process, which had been developed to a high degree of efficiency by Solvay in Belgium, who then licensed Brunner, Mond to use it. With Brunner providing the financial acumen and Mond the chemical insight, their team was well set to advance. It was just the situation in which Jarmay could exercise his own talents and in 1884 he established himself as a leading figure in the company by patenting, with Mond, a process for purifying crude bicarbonate of soda (a main product of the ammonia-soda process). He made many inventions on his own for which he was granted more than forty patents. He rose rapidly, from a junior managerial position to chief technical manager and to membership, in 1889, of the board of directors.<br>
<br>Jarmay's life revolved around the development of a number of technical processes, the most important being the manufacture of soda (sodium carbonate), a substance central to many manufactures, such as soap and glass, all of which were being made within easy reach of the Brunner, Mond factories. After Mond's death in 1909 Jarmay was largely responsible for the technical progress not only of Brunner, Mond but of other companies with which he was connected. At the outbreak of war in 1914 it became apparent that the country was seriously short of explosives, and a massive industrial effort was made to remedy this. The important Brunner, Mond contribution was led by Jarmay. He served on a government committee dealing with high explosives, to such good effect that in 1918, on the recommendation of Lord Moulton (who had been minister of munitions), he was made KBE.<br>
<br>The British industrial scene changed greatly as a consequence of the war, not only because of events within the United Kingdom but also because of what was happening in Europe and the world at large. New techniques developed abroad had to be studied, and one of these was the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in which the German chemists, Haber and Bosch, had made a revolution. Jarmay did something towards introducing the process into the UK, but younger men were now ready to lead. When the rationalization of the chemical industry led to the formation in 1926 of Imperial Chemical Industries, into which Brunner, Mond was absorbed, Jarmay might have been expected to be appointed to its board but he was not. He spent the last twenty years of his life in industrial activity but never quite at its centre. He was, however, able to enjoy the recreations which had coloured much of his life, keeping up his mountaineering and his hunting as long as he could. In the company of H. E. Roscoe, Mond, and others he took part in the discussions which led in 1881 to the foundation of the Society of Chemical Industry and maintained his connection with that and with the Institute of Chemistry and the Chemical Society. He enjoyed life and was noted for his hospitality. In group photographs of company staff he appears as an upright figure, bearded and commanding.<br>
<br>Jarmay set up another home in Italy but returned to England on the outbreak of war in 1939. He died at his home, 1 Lothair Villas, Hatfield, on 22 August 1944.<br>
