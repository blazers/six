<span class="headword">Pritchard <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Vaughan]</span>,  Hannah</span>  (1709&#150;1768), <span class="occ">actress and singer</span>, was born in London on 28 October 1709, the second of the five children of Edward Vaughan (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1680, <i>d</i>. before 1736) and his wife, Judith Dun (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1680, <i>d</i>. after 1758). She was baptized on 15 November at St Martin-in-the-Fields, and grew up in Holford's Alley, in the close vicinity of Drury Lane theatre. Her father was a staymaker and may have supplied stays and related accessories to the theatres.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1730 Hannah married William Pritchard (1708&#150;1763), then an &#145;Ingraver in prints&#146;, at The Globe tavern, Hatton Garden. William later became, briefly, an actor and then undertook a variety of administrative jobs in the theatre. Hannah and William had three daughters: Judith, baptized on 13 July 1731 at St Martin-in-the-Fields; Tamara (or Tamary) Elizabeth, baptized at St Clement Danes on 24 January 1738; and Hannah Mary, baptized on 13 April 1739, also at St Clement Danes. Eleven years later Hannah gave birth to a son, John (baptized on 17 June 1750), who appears to have died in infancy. By the time of his birth the Pritchards were living at 67 Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields (before that they had lived at 8 Craven Buildings in the parish of St Clement Danes, 56 Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, and Duke's Court, where they leased a house from the duke of Bedford). Little is known about Hannah Pritchard's private life except that she seems to have been a devoted wife and mother. In addition to their stage careers, the Pritchards ran a thriving dressmaking business which included the provision of theatrical costumes.<br>
<br>The date of Hannah Pritchard's first theatrical engagement is uncertain. Benjamin Victor claimed, in his <span class="italic">The History of the Theatres</span>, that she was engaged by the managers of Drury Lane theatre in 1732. Thomas Davies, however, in his <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of David Garrick</span>, states that her first appearance was at the Haymarket Theatre in one of Fielding's farces. Her first recorded role was the First Phillis in Edward Philips's ballad opera <span class="italic">The Livery Rake</span>, at Drury Lane on 5 May 1733 (though it is possible, according to <span class="italic">The London Stage</span>, that the cast list could be for a revival later that year). On 23 August 1733 she played Loveit in a ballad opera, <span class="italic">A Cure for Covetousness</span>, at Fielding and Hippisley's booth at Bartholomew fair. The company performed at the fair until 4 September, on which date the management responded to the public's enthusiasm for a duet entitled &#145;Sweet, if you love me, smiling turn&#146;, sung by Mrs Pritchard and the actor and tenor Salway, by providing free copies of the song to be given away daily at the booth. A contributor to the September issue of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, one &#145;R. S.&#146; (possibly the poet Richard Savage), praised her grace and wit in verse and looked forward to her translation to &#145;some nobler stage&#146; where she would her &#145;rival actresses outshine&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 3, 1733, 490).<br>
<br>Shortly after her appearance at Bartholomew fair Mrs Pritchard joined Theophilus Cibber's new company, the Comedians of his Majesty's Revels, at the Haymarket Theatre. Over the next few seasons she appeared, mostly at the Haymarket and Drury Lane, in a variety of roles. In 1740 she achieved her first major triumph, when, on 20 December, at Drury Lane, she played Rosalind in a revival of <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, a play &#145;Not Acted these Forty Years&#146;  (Scouten, 2.875). In <span class="italic">The Actor</span>, John Hill wrote that &#145;the first speech that ever obtained Mrs Pritchard a loud applause&#146; was Rosalind's &#145;Take the cork out of thy mouth, that I may drink thy tidings&#146;. She was &#145;applauded throughout [the speech] and for ever after&#146;. If it had not been for this performance of Rosalind, Hill suggests, it is possible that &#145;the best actress of the British stage would have perished in oblivion&#146;  (Hill, 195). Her other roles that season included Nerissa in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. It was in this production that Charles Macklin first enacted his legendary portrayal of Shylock.<br>
<br>On 5 October 1742 Mrs Pritchard acted for the first time with the young David Garrick, then a rapidly rising star. The venue was the Drury Lane theatre, and Garrick and Mrs Pritchard played Chamont and Monima in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>. In the same season, on 16 November, Mrs Pritchard was Gertrude to Garrick's Hamlet. The two actors continued to appear together in a variety of roles over the next few seasons. Then, in 1747, the Pritchards joined Garrick and James Lacy, who had bought the patent of the Drury Lane theatre. Hannah was engaged as a leading actress and William as treasurer.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1748 Garrick and Mrs Pritchard appeared together in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> for the first time, and the excellence of their performances was the subject of immediate acclaim. In the opinion of Thomas Davies their portrayal of events immediately before and after Duncan's murder could not be equalled. The &#145;merits of both were transcendent&#146;  (Davies, <span class="italic">Dramatic Miscellanies</span>, 2.148). Johann Zoffany's portrait of David Garrick and Hannah Pritchard in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (now at the Garrick Club), in which the tall, statuesque figure of Hannah Pritchard&#151;particularly in contrast to the smaller, slighter Garrick&#151;holds the dagger in one hand while pointing towards Duncan's chamber with the other, captures something of the physical power of her performance. Its thrilling intensity is suggested by Henry Fuseli's more atmospheric version of the scene. Mrs Pritchard was generally recognized as the greatest Lady Macbeth of her day. After her retirement Garrick acted the role of Macbeth only once (on 22 September 1768 before the king of Denmark, with Mrs Barry as Lady Macbeth), out of respect, it was believed, for the brilliance of Mrs Pritchard's performance.<br>
<br>Mrs Pritchard was a gifted actress, excelling in both tragedy and comedy, though, for a number of her contemporaries, her greatest skills were in comedy. Her performance of Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, when teamed with Garrick's Benedick, was highly acclaimed. She was slender and attractive as a young woman, though later in life she became very stout. She had a good voice and excellent timing. Her greatest strength, on the evidence of a number of her contemporaries, was her versatility. Whereas other actors, John Hill wrote, were immediately recognizable in every role they played because of one overriding characteristic (Garrick's &#145;spirit&#146;, Mr Barry's &#145;softness&#146;, Mrs Cibber's &#145;melancholy&#146;), &#145;Mrs Pritchard, having no distinguishing mark of this kind, carries with her nothing that is peculiar to herself into the character&#146;  (Hill, 60&#150;61). Her focus was primarily on the part she played, rather than on herself.<br>
<br>The fact that Mrs Pritchard identified strongly with the characters she played (occasionally to their detriment) is evident from her performance of the eponymous character in John Delap's <span class="italic">Hecuba</span> on 11 December 1761, in the course of which, according to the play's author, she sobbed so much that she spoiled the play. She had other detractors too. Samuel Johnson told Sarah Siddons, who asked his opinion of Mrs Pritchard's acting (which she had never seen), that she &#145;was a vulgar idiot&#146;  (Manvell, 95), and claimed that she had read only her own part in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>. Johnson appears, however, to have blamed Mrs Pritchard for the hostile reception of his play <span class="italic">Mahomet and Irene</span>, in which she played Irene, and this probably clouded his view. This was the opinion of Mrs Thrale, who considered Mrs Pritchard &#145;incomparable&#146;, and noted that &#145;her Intelligence pervaded every Sense&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thraliana</span>, 2.726).<br>
<br>By the 1764&#150;5 season Mrs Pritchard's health had begun to suffer. On 25 April 1768 she gave her final performance, in the role of Lady Macbeth. Garrick, who played Macbeth, wrote a farewell epilogue for her to speak, which Davies writes that she delivered &#145;with many sobs and tears&#146;  (Davies, <span class="italic">Life of David Garrick</span>, 2.190). Following this she retired and moved to Bath, where she died on 20 August 1768, &#145;of a mortification in her foot&#146;  (ibid.). She was buried on 28 August at St Mary's, Twickenham. In 1772 a white marble memorial tablet was erected in Westminster Abbey, next to Shakespeare's monument in Poets' Corner. O'Keeffe, who often saw Hannah Pritchard act, noted in his <span class="italic">Recollections</span> that she &#145;well deserve[d]&#146; this recognition  (O'Keeffe, 1.107). The memorial was later moved to the triforium.<br>
<br>The chief beneficiaries of Hannah Pritchard's will were her daughters. Her property in Twickenham (Ragman's Castle) was left, in common, to the three of them, and Tamara Elizabeth and Hannah Mary inherited the lease of her house in Tavistock Street, London (with thirty years still to run). Tamara Elizabeth received, in addition, &pound;700, in stocks or a house purchased with that sum, along with a variety of household and personal effects belonging to her late mother. Judith received a mourning ring (which had originally been her mother's wedding ring and which Hannah had had transformed into a mourning ring on the death of her husband), and Hannah's two portraits by Francis Hayman.<br>
