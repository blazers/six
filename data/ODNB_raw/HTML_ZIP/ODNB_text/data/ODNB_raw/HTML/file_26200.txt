<span class="headword">Stafford,  Anthony</span>  (<em>b. </em>1586/7, <em>d.</em> in or after 1645), <span class="occ">author</span>, was the fifth and youngest son of John Stafford, esquire (<i>d</i>. 1595), of Blatherwick, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Bridget Clopton. He may have received his early education at Westminster School. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 8 March 1605, aged eighteen, and was admitted as a student at the Inner Temple on 30 January 1606. However, he never completed his studies at either place, probably because of the disgrace which overtook his family in June 1607 when his eldest brother, Humphrey, was executed for the buggery of two teenaged boys. The case was reported in a contemporary pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Arraignement, Judgement, Confession and Execution of Humfrey Stafford</span> (1607), which drew particular attention to the fact that the accused was &#145;a Gentleman of high birth, and honorablie descended&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Arraignement</span>). Oblique references to the case can be found in some of Anthony's later works: in <span class="italic">Staffords Niobe</span> (1611) he declared that it was better to die childless &#145;than hereafter to let any crooked branch deform the beauty of the whole stocke, or any disorderlie person &hellip; purchase infamy to his whole family&#146;, though he added that he could not understand &#145;how a man by never so hainous a fact can taint his whole blood or kindred&#146;, as vice was not hereditary.<br>
<br>In 1609 Stafford was admitted to study in the Bodleian Library, and over the next few years he published a series of moral treatises drawing on his extensive reading, including <span class="italic">Staffords Niobe</span> (1611), <span class="italic">Meditations and Resolutions, Morall, Divine, Politicall</span> (1612), <span class="italic">The Golden Meane</span> (1613), and <span class="italic">Staffords Heavenly Dogge</span> (1615). The recurring theme of these works is the definition of true gentility. <span class="italic">Staffords Niobe</span> attacks the ignorant gentleman &#145;whose minde is capable of nothing but a hunting-match, a racket-court or a cock-pit, or at the most the story of Susanna in an alehouse&#146;, and extols Sir Philip Sidney as the personification of the gentlemanly ideal. The title-page of <span class="italic">Meditations and Resolutions</span> explains that the work is &#145;written for the instruction and bettering of youth; but especially of the better and more noble&#146;, and <span class="italic">The Golden Meane</span> (anonymous, but plausibly attributed to Stafford on stylistic and bibliographical grounds) is a discourse on &#145;the noblenesse of perfect Virtue in extremes&#146;, written in the form of a letter to a &#145;noble Lord&#146;, identified in later editions as Henry, earl of Northumberland. Stafford dedicated these works to a series of prospective patrons: <span class="italic">Staffords Niobe</span> to Robert, earl of Salisbury (to whom Stafford admits he is a &#145;stranger&#146;), <span class="italic">Meditations and Resolutions</span> to Frances, countess of Hertford (of whom he claims to be a &#145;kinsman&#146;), and <span class="italic">Staffords Heavenly Dogge</span> to his &#145;deare friend&#146; Sir John Wentworth, in whose household he may have been living at the time.<br>
<br>In 1622 Stafford was living in Antwerp, where he was part of a Europe-wide network of correspondents supplying news to the British charg&eacute; d'affaires in Brussels, William Trumbull. The relationship between the two men was evidently close: Stafford addressed Trumbull as his &#145;deare father&#146; and assured him that &#145;above all men living, my deare Lord excepted, I most love and honour you&#146;. Stafford's &#145;deare Lord&#146; was his patron George, Lord Berkeley (1601&#150;1658), with whom he had been travelling on the continent, and to whom he dedicated his next book, <span class="italic">The Guide of Honour</span> (written <i>c</i>.1621 but not published until 1634), the last and most detailed of his treatises on the nature of gentility. <span class="italic">The Guide of Honour</span> discusses various aspects of gentlemanly behaviour&#151;learning and religious devotion, hospitality, and &#145;care of your private estate&#146;&#151;and argues that in each case the true gentleman is distinguished by his lack of ostentation. It also refers in passing to another projected work by Stafford, which he also proposed to dedicate to Lord Berkeley: &#145;I shall shortly write you a peculiar Tract of Historie, and dedicate that to your Lordships Name, as I have already my selfe to your service&#146;; however, this work does not appear to have survived. Stafford was in attendance on Lord Berkeley in July 1623, when they both received the MA degree at Oxford; and G. C. Moore Smith has suggested that Thomas Randolph's ode, &#145;To Master Anthony Stafford to Hasten him into the Country&#146;, may have been written on the occasion of a visit to Berkeley Castle.<br>
<br>Most of Stafford's later works are on religious themes. <span class="italic">The Day of Salvation</span> (1635), dedicated to Lord Berkeley's sister, Theophila, Lady Coke, consists of an extended meditation on the death and passion of Christ. This was followed by two works of translation, <span class="italic">A Synopsis or Compendium of the Fathers</span> (1635) from the French work by the protestant theologian Daniel Tossanus (1541&#150;1602), and <span class="italic">A Wittie Encounter between Monsieur de Moulin and Monsieur de Balzac</span> (1636), which deals with various matters of religious controversy, including Jesuit theories of regicide. By far the most famous of Stafford's religious writings, however, was his panegyric on the Virgin Mary, <span class="italic">The Femall Glory</span> (1635), also dedicated to Lady Coke and described on the title-page as &#145;a treatise worthy the reading and meditation of all modest women, who live under the Government of Vertue and are obedient to her Lawes&#146;. Its publication provoked a storm of protest. The puritan minister Henry Burton attacked the work in his sermon <span class="italic">For God and the King</span> (1636), in which he accused Stafford of crypto-Catholicism, quoting with disgust some of Stafford's more extravagant praise of the Virgin Mary, such as the description of her as &#145;the Grand White Immaculate Abbesse of your snowy Nunneries&#146;. Stafford defended himself in <span class="italic">A Just Apology or Vindication of a Booke Entituled &#145;The Female Glory&#146;</span>, dedicated to Archbishop William Laud and Bishop William Juxon, which survives in a manuscript at Queen's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Despite the unguarded language of <span class="italic">The Femall Glory</span>, Stafford was not a Roman Catholic. His book depicts the Virgin Mary as the embodiment of various feminine virtues&#151;such as humility, obedience, and &#145;motherly care&#146;&#151;echoing some of his earlier works on gentility, in which an idealized figure such as Sir Philip Sidney is held up as a pattern for his readers to imitate. In his <span class="italic">Just Apology</span> Stafford claimed that he had merely intended to praise the Virgin Mary, not to invoke her as a saint, and this is corroborated by <span class="italic">The Day of Salvation</span>, in which he firmly declares that one can be saved only by the merits of Christ, not by the intercession of &#145;other holy men or angells&#146;. By this stage, however, Stafford had abandoned some of his earlier religious opinions. In <span class="italic">Staffords Niobe</span> he had offered a qualified defence of puritan nonconformity, declaring that although puritans were &#145;guilty of schism, yet they are not dangerous, but live and dye without thought of slaughter&#146;. These views are retracted in the <span class="italic">Just Apology</span>, which states unequivocally that puritans are &#145;dangerous, even above the Jesuit&#146; because &#145;they teach Deposition of Kings&#146;. In his strong hostility to puritanism, his reluctance to engage in anti-Catholic polemic, and his respect for the authority of the Church of England, Stafford was typical of the new style of religious orthodoxy promoted by Archbishop Laud.<br>
<br>Stafford's final work, <span class="italic">Honour and Vertue Triumphing over the Grave</span> (1640), was a biography of his kinsman Henry, fourteenth Baron Stafford, who had died in 1637 at the age of sixteen. It is dedicated to his new patron, the earl of Arundel, and resembles Stafford's earlier works in its attempt to define the nature and attributes of &#145;true Nobility&#146;. Little is known about Stafford's last years: he was still alive in January 1645, when his brother Walter bequeathed him &pound;5 in his will, but Anthony Wood stated that &#145;he died, as I have been informed, in the time of the civil wars&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>). He almost certainly never married. Most of his works have never been reprinted, but <span class="italic">The Femall Glory</span> and <span class="italic">A Just Apology</span> were edited by the Anglo-Catholic priest Orby Shipley in 1860.<br>
