<span class="headword">Durham,  Frances Hermia</span>  (1873&#150;1948), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born at Aldwick, Pagham, Sussex, on 15 August 1873, the youngest of the nine children of Arthur Edward Durham (1834&#150;1895), a surgeon at Guy's Hospital, London, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ellis. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37379/', "(Mary) Edith Durham")</script> was her elder sister. She was educated privately in London and Rugby, attended Notting Hill high school, and then studied from 1892 to 1896 at Girton College, Cambridge, where she was a college scholar. She played hockey for Girton. One contemporary recalled her love of a funny story, but also &#145;how sternly&#146; she once kept a college reading party to its agreed schedule of seven hours' work a day  (<span class="italic">Girton Review</span>, 29). She gained a second class in the historical tripos in 1895, and a second class in part one of the moral science tripos in 1896. After completing her studies she trained in palaeography and spent three years, from 1897 to 1900, in cataloguing private collections of family archives. She was awarded the Alexander medal of the Royal Historical Society in 1898.<br>
<br>On leaving Cambridge Durham also undertook social work with the Women's University Settlement. In 1900 she became co-founder and co-secretary of its Southwark registry and apprenticeship committee. Having gained valuable experience of social and working conditions in London, she was appointed in 1907 as an inspector and organizer of technical classes for women and trade schools under the London county council education committee. She was also a member of the consultative committee at the Board of Education from 1908 to 1913. In 1915 she entered the civil service as chief woman inspector in the insurance and unemployment department of the Board of Trade. In the following year she transferred to the Ministry of Labour, and in 1918 she was promoted to assistant secretary. During the First World War Durham was &#145;largely responsible&#146; for the organization of women's services in the army, munitions, and agriculture  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Dec 1933, 14e). In 1919 she was appointed CBE in recognition. She afterwards served on the central committee for employment and training of women (1919&#150;35).<br>
<br>After 1916 increasing numbers of women were admitted to the higher grades of the civil service, and Durham and her Girton contemporary Isabel Dickson (1872&#150;1922) were the first to reach the rank of assistant secretary. Women civil servants were not, however, employed on the same terms as men. They enjoyed neither equal pay nor equal opportunities. In 1920 some of them formed the committee of higher women in the civil service, which later became the council of women civil servants. Durham was its first president. A &#145;fearless advocate&#146; of women's progress in the service, she was nevertheless cautious in her approach, &#145;always temperate in her judgments, always sure to present the women's case in moderate and judicial language&#146;  (<span class="italic">Girton Review</span>, 27). One contemporary described her as &#145;statesmanlike&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Determined that women should make their presence felt, Durham led the committee of higher women in organizing a series of highly successful receptions, which were well attended by heads of department and distinguished outsiders. In 1931 she took the chair at a dinner given by the committee to celebrate the findings of Lord Tomlin's royal commission on the civil service. This had concluded that as far as possible all posts should be open to men and women equally. But while the commission openly recognized the prejudice that women civil servants faced, it gave no clear lead on the key issue of equal pay. It also recommended the retention of the rule whereby women civil servants were expected to retire on marriage. When the Tomlin commission was appointed, in November 1929, Durham was one of only three women to hold the rank of assistant secretary or above. She was a survivor of a period of post-war optimism, when it seemed that women were about to make real inroads in the civil service. By the time of her retirement, in 1933, this optimism had dissipated. In 1939 the number of women at the rank of assistant secretary or higher remained what it had been a decade earlier.<br>
<br>In retirement Durham went to live in the house that she had built with her sister, Florence, at Hawkern, on the edge of the village of Otterton, near Budleigh Salterton, south Devon. She was soon co-opted on to Devon county education committee, on which she served from 1934 to 1939. She surprised her colleagues by visiting schools in remote villages and roundly condemning the poor conditions that she found in some of them. Her sister, who too had been at Girton and who had a career in medical research, shared her social concern. Together they took a keen interest &#145;in the welfare of their own village folk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Girton Review</span>, 28), and battled with landlords and local authorities for basic improvements to cottage dwellings. During the war they opened their home to soldiers billeted nearby, offering hot baths, cups of tea, and the tranquillity of their garden. Frances Hermia Durham, who remained unmarried, died of heart failure at her home at Hawkern on 18 August 1948.<br>
