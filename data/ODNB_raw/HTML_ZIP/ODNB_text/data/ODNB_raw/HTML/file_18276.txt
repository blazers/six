<span class="headword">Mason,  James</span>  (<em>c.</em>1723&#150;1805), <span class="occ">landscape engraver</span>, was listed in 1744 by George Vertue as one of a group of new engravers being employed by the publisher Arthur Pond. Nothing is known of his early life, but he was probably born about twenty years earlier. For Pond he engraved ten landscapes by Gaspard Poussin and three by Claude, the earliest dated 1743, and he also engraved illustrations for Anson's voyages. In April 1746 Mason himself co-published with Peter Canot six landscapes after Jean-Baptiste Chatelain. He rapidly established a reputation as a talented landscape engraver, working after Thomas Smith (1749&#150;51), William Bellers (1754&#150;63), George Lambert (1745&#150;61), Paul Sandby (1754), Jean Pillement (1759&#150;62), Thomas Gainsborough (1763), Francesco Zuccarelli (1765), William Woollett (1766), and Richard Wilson (1767), and he was one of a group of talented landscape engravers whose work attracted favourable notice throughout Europe during the 1760s.<br>
<br>In 1763 Mason was living in Phoenix Alley, Hart Street, Covent Garden, but in the late 1760s he moved to Windmill Street and finally, in 1771, to Winchester Row, Paddington, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the Society of Artists but exhibited with them only before trouble broke out between the court faction and the rank and file and after the mass resignation of the court faction. In the mid-1760s he exhibited with the Free Society of Artists. He produced several prints of sea fights and some important colonial views, notably four views of Halifax, Nova Scotia, after Dominic Serres, but his most highly regarded prints were three large landscapes after Claude for John Boydell's <span class="italic">Collection of Prints Engraved after the most Capital Paintings in England</span>. While he engraved several more landscapes after old masters for Boydell, he seems to have engraved less and less after 1780. He died at his home in Winchester Row in April 1805, and was buried at St Mary, Paddington, on 27 April. In his will, proved on 20 May 1805, he called himself engraver and shopkeeper. The sale after his death held by King and Loch&eacute;e on 3 April 1806 consisted chiefly of his own proof prints and others by fellow landscape engravers, and the catalogue reveals nothing of the nature of his shop. He left a widow, Mary Magdalen, two unmarried children, Benjamin James and Mary Elizabeth, another son, Michael, a widowed daughter, Elizabeth Wareup, and a grandson, William Mark Wareup, and was able to leave modest annuities to all of them. The apparent difference in age suggests that Michael and Elizabeth might have been children of an earlier marriage.<br>
