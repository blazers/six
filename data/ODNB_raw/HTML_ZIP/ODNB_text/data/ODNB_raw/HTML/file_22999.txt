<span class="headword">Radford,  Thomas</span>  (1793&#150;1881), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born at Hulme Fields, Salford, on 2 November 1793, the son of John Radford, dyer and bleacher. After early education at a private school at Chester, at the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to his uncle William Wood, surgeon, who was attached to the Manchester and Salford Lying-in Institution. Radford studied medicine at Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals, qualifying LSA and MRCS in 1817. In 1818 he was elected surgeon to the Manchester and Salford Lying-in Hospital. He continued his connection with the hospital as well as with St Mary's Hospital, which was associated with it, in various capacities to the end of his life. He was man-midwife-in-ordinary in 1821; surgeon-extraordinary in 1834; consulting physician from 1841 to 1881; and chairman of the board of management of St Mary's Hospital from 1874 to 1881. Radford graduated MD at Heidelberg in 1839, and later that year he was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He married in 1821 Elizabeth Newton, daughter of John Newton, incumbent of Didsbury, near Manchester. She died in 1874. Their only child died young.<br>
<br>The interests of St Mary's Hospital were always Radford's special concern. A new building for the hospital, opened in 1856, was built mainly through the exertions of Radford and his wife. He gave to the hospital, in 1853, his valuable library, rich in obstetrical works, and his museum of surgical objects, afterwards making many important additions to both collections. Some time before his death he put the sum of &pound;3670 into a trust. Of this sum, &pound;2670 was set aside for the provision of medical care to the poor residents in Hulme Fields; the remaining &pound;1000 was intended for the maintenance of the library. A catalogue of the Radford Library, compiled by C. J. Cullingworth, was published in 1877.<br>
<br>Radford was a pioneer of medical education in Manchester. Between 1825 and 1826 he lectured at Mr Jordan's school of anatomy on the theory and practice of midwifery. In 1829 he gave lectures on midwifery and the diseases of women and children at the theatre of anatomy and medicine at 9 Marsden Street. In 1832, in conjunction with Mr R. T. Hunt, also of the Lying-in Hospital, he lectured on the same subject at Hunt's rooms at 90 King Street. In 1833 he taught midwifery at Mr Turner's medical school in Pine Street, the first complete provincial medical school. Radford was elected president of the Manchester Medical Society in 1848.<br>
<br>Radford delivered the first address on obstetrics before the Provincial (now British) Medical Association at its meeting in 1854, and was the author of many papers and communications on midwifery, and of <span class="italic">Observations on C&aelig;sarean Section, Craniotomy and other Obstetric Operations</span> (1865), besides several pamphlets. Radford was a notable link in the chain of able and well-known Manchester gynaecologists, starting with Charles White and including John Roberton, James Whitehead, and others. Influenced by John Hull, Radford campaigned for the replacement of craniotomy by caesarean section at a time when the procedure was strongly condemned by the British obstetrical establishment. He defended the operation in a short treatise entitled <span class="italic">The Value of Embryonic and Foetal Life, Socially and Obstetrically Considered</span> (1848). Radford was also one of the first in Britain to advocate the removal of cystic ovaries by abdominal section, a controversial procedure that provoked fierce debate in Britain. He gave much advice and support to Charles Clay in his early operations for the removal of diseased ovaries, helping to justify the claim of Manchester to have been the cradle of abdominal surgery in Britain. Radford was also the inventor of two types of forceps.<br>
<br>Radford died at his residence at Higher Broughton, Manchester, on 29 May 1881 and was buried in the neighbouring church of St Paul, Kersal.<br>
