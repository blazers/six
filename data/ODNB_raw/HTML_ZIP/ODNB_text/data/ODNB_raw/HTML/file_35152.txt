<span class="headword">Murison,  Alexander Falconer</span>  (1847&#150;1934), <span class="occ">jurist and author</span>, was born at Walhowe, in the parish of Deer, Aberdeenshire, on 3 March 1847, the eldest of the four sons of Alexander Murison, a crofter of Walhowe, and his wife, Elspeth, daughter of William Murison, a crofter of Bridge-foot, near Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. He was proud to recall that he had once acted as a herd-boy on his native hills. In his autobiography, written at the age of eighty-six, he vividly described the struggles involved in securing a better education than that afforded by the local village schools. Having won a bursary at Aberdeen grammar school, he showed his gift for languages, winning school prizes for Latin and Greek and gaining the first bursary at Aberdeen University, where he graduated with first-class honours in classics.<br>
<br>On leaving university, Murison returned to his old school as head English master (1869&#150;77), and soon proved to be an inspiring teacher. In 1870 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1924), the elder daughter of William Logan, shopkeeper, of Fetterangus, Aberdeenshire; they had two sons, the younger of whom, (James) William Murison (<i>d</i>. 1945), became a chief justice of Zanzibar and of the Straits Settlements.<br>
<br>Murison then decided to go to London, where he entered the Middle Temple on 16 November 1876 and was called to the bar on 29 June 1881. During this period Murison supported himself by teaching and by journalism, practising before the privy council and the Chancery Division. On 1 October 1883 he succeeded W. A. Hunter, to whom he owed much, as professor of Roman law at University College, London. In 1901 he was appointed professor of jurisprudence there and in 1913 he became deputy professor of Roman-Dutch law. He held these posts concurrently until he retired in 1925, having been in the service of the college as professor for forty-two years, during which he was also dean of the faculty of laws (1912&#150;24), and a member of the senate of the University of London (1921&#150;4). In 1915 he was appointed deputy reader in Roman law at Oxford, and in 1916 deputy professor to Henry Goudy, the regius professor of civil law. That Murison did not succeed Goudy to the chair on the latter's retirement was attributed by his contemporaries to his advancing years. In 1924 he was appointed KC by Lord Chancellor Haldane.<br>
<br>During the forty-two years in which he held office in London, Murison set himself the stupendous task of collating the codices of the text of Justinian's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>. Pursuit of this aim led him to all the great law libraries of Europe, always travelling third class (and on one occasion in a cattle-truck) because of the meagreness of his pay and the paucity of his private means. But his immense erudition, his mastery of practically every European language except Turkish, his accomplishment as a Latin, Greek, and Hebrew scholar, combined with his engaging modesty and charm, made him friends everywhere among foreign jurists, and won him an international reputation for scholarship. Unfortunately the colossal undertaking was never completed, and the results remain in manuscript in voluminous notebooks. Almost the only published contribution in English made by Murison on the civil law is a historical introduction entitled &#145;The external history of Roman law&#146; prefixed to the second edition (1885) of W. A. Hunter's <span class="italic">Roman Law</span>. As his poverty diverted him from pursuing the success that might have been his at the bar, by enticing him into the production of educational textbooks and journalism (he joined the staff of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> in early days and from 1902 to 1912 was editor of the <span class="italic">Educational Times</span>), so also the versatility of his mind led him to play truant to the cause of jurisprudence, for he translated the whole of Horace (1931) and of Pindar (1933) into verse, Virgil's <span class="italic">Bucolics and Georgics</span> (1932), and the first twelve books of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1933) into English hexameters, and Schiller's <span class="italic">Wallenstein</span> (1931) into English verse with the original metres. A translation of books xiii to xix of the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> remained in manuscript. In Italy, where his scholarship was highly esteemed among his contemporaries, he published a characteristic treatise, <span class="italic">Il diritto nei poeti Latini</span> (1935), which was read at the International Congress of Roman Law held in Rome in 1933. His intellectual vigour remained unimpaired to the last.<br>
<br>The honorary degree of LLD was conferred on Murison in 1893 by the University of Aberdeen, for the lord rectorship of which he stood against Lord Huntly in 1896 and was but narrowly beaten. In politics an ardent Liberal, he unsuccessfully contested, at four general elections, in 1900, 1906, and 1910, three Conservative strongholds, the Bridgeton division of Glasgow, the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen, and, twice, the Central division of Glasgow.<br>
<br>Murison died at his home, 26 Victoria Road, Clapham Common, London, on 8 June 1934.<br>
