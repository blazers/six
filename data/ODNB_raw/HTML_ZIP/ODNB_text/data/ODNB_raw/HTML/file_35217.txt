<span class="headword">Newmarch,  Charles Henry</span>  (1824&#150;1903), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, born at Burford, Oxfordshire, on 30 March 1824, was the second son of George Newmarch, solicitor, of Cirencester, and his wife, Mary. After studying at Rugby under Dr Arnold from August 1837, following in the footsteps of his elder brother, George Frederick, who had joined that school in 1830, Newmarch spent some time in the merchant navy, travelling in the East. In 1847 he published <span class="italic">Five Years in the East</span> under the pseudonym of R. N. Hutton. It attracted favourable reviews, and was followed in 1848 by <span class="italic">Recollections of Rugby, by an Old Rugbeian</span> and a novel, <span class="italic">Jealousy</span>. Settling in Cirencester, Newmarch showed keen interest in local antiquities, and in 1850 wrote with James Buckman (1814&#150;1884) <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Remains of Roman Art in Cirencester</span>. In 1851 he was instrumental in the foundation of the <span class="italic">Cirencester and Swindon Express</span>, which was soon amalgamated with the <span class="italic">Wilts and Gloucester Standard</span>. He was joint editor of the paper and, until the end of his life, a regular contributor under the name of Rambler. In 1868 he published with his brother an account of the Newmarch pedigree.<br>
<br>Newmarch matriculated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1851, graduating BA in 1855. On 6 February 1855 he married, at Leckhampton, Anne Straford of Cheltenham and Charlton Kings; the couple had two sons and three daughters. After taking holy orders in 1855, he was from 1856 to 1893 rector of Wardley-cum-Belton, Rutland, and rural dean of the district from 1857 to 1867. He was greatly interested in agricultural matters, contributing much to <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> on the subject; he championed the cause of village labourers, who in turn defended him against the attacks of Joseph Arch, when Arch visited Belton in his tour of the village districts in 1872. Newmarch took an active part in the building of churches in Rutland, and restored the chancel of his parish church. Increasing deafness led to his retirement in 1893 to 37 Upper Grosvenor Road, Tunbridge Wells, where he died on 14 June 1903. One daughter survived him. A tablet to his memory was erected in Belton church in 1912.<br>
