<span class="headword">Frankel,  William</span>  (1917&#150;2008), <span class="occ">barrister and newspaper editor</span>, was born Woolf Frankel at 1A Eastman Court, Whitechapel, London, on 3 February 1917, the second of three sons of Isaac Frankel, a street trader and synagogue beadle, and his wife, Hannah (Anna), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lacker. His parents had arrived from the Galician area of Poland a few years before his birth. Isaac Frankel changed his surname on arrival in London to that of his mother's maiden name, having been advised that his own, Kiesel, sounded &#145;very foreign&#146;  (Frankel, 1). The Frankel family lived in impoverished conditions at a variety of addresses in London dictated primarily by Isaac's chequered work career. Living in an Orthodox Jewish milieu (an upbringing that flavoured and influenced his life), Frankel attended a succession of East End schools. But, at the age of eleven, the unconventionality that was to be his hallmark showed itself when, after matriculation, he enrolled in the Polytechnic Secondary School in Regent Street. However, that institution failed to inspire any career ambition and he turned, in his sixth-form year, to the Davenant Foundation School, hoping it might provide him with the background in classics needed for admission to Jews' College, the training establishment for the Jewish ministry. But that school, too, bored young Frankel, and he left.<br>
<br>Frankel's first paid job after school, with an East End scrap merchant, did not last long. Nor did the next, as a warehouseman with a company importing Japanese goods. He was happier, but still without ambition, when, aged twenty, having moved through a couple of office posts with Orthodox Jewish organizations, he was appointed secretary of the Mizrachi Federation of Great Britain and Ireland, a leading religious Zionist organization. On 16 April 1939, less than five months before the outbreak of the Second World War, he married, in a ceremony at the prestigious Great Synagogue in the City, Gertrude Freda Reed (<i>b</i>. 1916), daughter of Louis Reed, a travelling salesman&#151;and exhausted their savings with a wedding party at the Ritz Hotel. They had two children, Anne and John. Having moved to Cambridge in 1940 to escape the Blitz, Frankel and the Mizrachi Federation agreed to part company. Taking advantage of the wartime installation of the London School of Economics in Cambridge, and with the help of his wife's occasional earnings, fees from teaching Hebrew to local Jewish children, and sporadic family handouts, Frankel (who had been rejected as unfit for military service) enrolled in its law school. He graduated LLB with upper second-class honours. He later repaid what he felt was his debt to Cambridge by becoming a major fund-raiser for the university's Centre for Modern Hebrew Studies.<br>
<br>Back in London Frankel was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1944 while working for a year as assistant secretary to the foreign affairs committee of the Board of Deputies, the representative body of Anglo-Jewry. It was through this appointment that he established what was to be a life-long connection with the American Jewish Committee (a major Jewish advocacy group operating worldwide), whose London representative he became on a part-time basis, an engagement that, despite his membership of the Middle Temple and well-regarded chambers, gave him more satisfaction than his time at the bar. It was at an American Jewish Committee dinner that he first met the managing director (later chairman) of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, David Kessler, who a few years later offered him the job of general manager at the paper, the world's oldest Jewish weekly newspaper (established 1841), which he took up in 1955. It was a surprise to Frankel and the staff of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> when, three years later, Kessler asked him to become editor.<br>
<br>At the time Frankel became editor of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> it was a worthy and respected communal journal, but he swore to make of it &#145;a stimulant for and accurate mirror of Jewish life&#146;  (Frankel, 122). He largely succeeded in his purpose, opening its columns to the best young Jewish writers of the day, vastly expanding the newspaper's foreign coverage, and bringing from Glasgow a young columnist, Chaim Bermant, whose weekly commentary on world Jewish affairs was to become for many years the most read column in the paper. Frankel, whose association with American Jewry had exposed him to new thinking about the nature and practice of the Jewish religion, was not averse to controversy in his columns, frequently challenging the authority of the established Orthodox rabbinate. One episode, which earned him both condemnation from the Jewish religious establishment and national recognition as a campaigning editor, was his support for Rabbi Louis Jacobs during the so-called Jacobs affair, beginning in 1961. Jacobs, a major young scholar, seen by some as a future chief rabbi, was barred by the chief rabbi, Israel Brodie, from taking up the post of moral tutor at Jews' College because of writings in which he rejected the divine origin of the <span class="roman">Torah</span>, the main part of the Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Frankel put his personal and his newspaper's prestige totally behind Jacobs and was to the fore in the founding in 1964 of a new synagogue movement in Britain, Masorti, headed by Jacobs. Reflecting half a century later, Frankel wrote: &#145;I readily concede I may have been too passionate in my pro-Jacobs advocacy in the <span class="roman">JC</span>&#146;  (ibid., 171).<br>
<br>Frankel's first marriage ended in divorce in 1971, and on 16 December 1973 he married Claire Neuman of Baltimore, Maryland, who had three daughters from her former marriage. Four years later, in 1977, on his sixtieth birthday, Frankel (who had been made CBE in 1970) retired from the editorship of the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, though he maintained his connection, serving as chairman from 1991 to 1994. His years after giving up the editorial chair were among the most active of his life; they included service as a special adviser to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (1977&#150;81), president of the Mental Health Review appeal tribunal (1978&#150;89), and chairman of the Social Security appeal tribunal (1979&#150;89), as well as an officer of a number of national and international Jewish organizations and a member of the governing bodies of various educational institutions. He took great delight in writing a weekly column for <span class="italic">The Statesman</span> of India, an association which lasted for over twenty years, and from 1982 to 1992 he edited an annual <span class="italic">Survey of Jewish Affairs</span> for the Institute of Jewish Affairs (later the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, of which he was a vice-president). He and his wife established a pattern of living at their home in Washington, DC, during the winter months and spending the summer at their apartment in Montagu Square, Marylebone, London (he was a regular at Lords during the cricket season). He published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Tea with Einstein and Other Memories</span>, in 2006, the title being taken from the occasion he visited the great scientist at home in Princeton in 1947; he had earlier published <span class="italic">Friday Nights</span> (1973), an anthology of <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> pieces, and <span class="italic">Israel Observed: an Anatomy of the State</span> (1980). In his final years, he developed Parkinson's disease. It was while walking in Washington on 18 April 2008 that he fell and suffered a cerebral haemorrhage from which he died. He was buried in London on 24 April 2008. A memorial service was held at the (Masorti) New London Synagogue, St John's Wood, on 12 June 2008. He was survived by his second wife, Claire, and his son, John, his daughter, Anne, having died in 1989 (a source of much grief in his later years).<br>
