<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Albery, Sir  Bronson James</span>  (1881&#150;1971), <span class="occ">theatre director</span>, was born at Greenhithe, Kent, on 6 March 1881, the second in the family of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/278/', "James Albery (1838&#150;1889)")</script>, dramatist, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37053/', "Mary Charlotte Moore (1861&#150;1931)")</script>, actress, later Lady Wyndham. He was named after the American dramatist Bronson Howard. His father died when he was eight and he and his two brothers were brought up by their mother, who had returned to the stage when James Albery was no longer able to write. He was educated at Uppingham School and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained a second class in modern history in 1903. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1904 but his legal career was brief, though the intricacies of theatrical contracts would never defeat him. He married in 1912 Una Gwynn (<i>d</i>. 1981), daughter of Thomas William Rolleston, of Glasshouse, Shinrone, Irish scholar, poet, and friend of W. B. Yeats. They had two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Albery's first theatrical venture, with Allan Aynesworth at the Criterion in 1914, was Cyril Harcourt's comedy, <span class="italic">A Pair of Silk Stockings</span>; they put on two other plays that year. The war, in which he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve from 1917 to 1919, ended, for the time being, his connection with the theatre, but this resumed in 1920 with a revival at the Kingsway of <span class="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</span> by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. In this production by Nigel Playfair, which originated at the Birmingham repertory theatre and ran for ninety-seven performances, the very young No&euml;l Coward surprisingly played the grocer's apprentice.<br>
<br>From his mother Albery inherited his business sense, for, although Mary Moore was primarily a comedienne, it was her drive that led Sir Charles Wyndham to enlarge his theatrical empire&#151;which began at the Criterion&#151;and to build Wyndham's in 1899 and the New in 1903. Mary Moore had played in <span class="italic">David Garrick</span> with Charles Wyndham in many revivals, so it was understandable that Bronson Albery's next choice of production should be a musical version of the play at the Queen's in 1922. He would now be of great help to his mother in the running of the three family theatres, and in 1922 Lewis Casson and Sybil Thorndike began their association with him. Sybil Thorndike's performance in <span class="italic">The Cenci</span> at a special matin&eacute;e at the New convinced G. B. Shaw that she would be perfect for Saint Joan. With some misgivings, as it had a long cast and was, unfashionably, a costume play, in 1924 Albery agreed to do <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span>, which presently broke all existing records at the theatre.<br>
<br>When Albery found the family theatres' atmosphere restricting he was glad to help to establish the Arts Theatre Club in 1927. Nor was he obsessively commercial; when he saw the Compagnie des Quinze at the Vieux-Colombier in Paris he decided that discerning London audiences should be given a chance to see these actors. In 1931 he brought them, in <span class="italic">No&euml;</span>, to the Arts and then to the Ambassador's realizing, as he told W. A. Darlington, that &#145;the venture must lose&#146;. After his mother's death in that year, he and Wyndham's son, Howard, were in joint command of the three theatres. From the Arts he transferred to the Criterion in 1932 in Ronald Mackenzie's <span class="italic">Musical Chairs</span>, with John Gielgud. This was the beginning of an association that would do much for both actor and manager. During his years at the New&#151;in <span class="italic">Richard of Bordeaux</span>, <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, <span class="italic">Noah</span>, and <span class="italic">The Seagull</span>&#151;Gielgud built his unchallenged position, and Albery would be regarded as a manager of distinction and taste. Though after 1935 they no longer worked together, they remained friends; Gielgud had always found Bronnie to be encouraging and never unduly interfering, but he was also shrewd enough to withdraw from the production of a play by Emlyn Williams in which Gielgud appeared and which ran a week.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, while the New Theatre housed the Old Vic Company in seasons of classical acting at its best, Albery was its joint administrator from 1942 to 1944 with Tyrone Guthrie. After this he would be increasingly a theatre committee man, serving on such bodies as the Arts Council from 1948, the British Council drama advisory committee (1952&#150;61), and the Society of West End Theatre Managers, of which he was president from 1941 to 1945 and 1952 to 1953. As a reader of plays his wife was of great help; perhaps through her influence he presented in 1946 the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Red Roses for Me</span> by Sean O'Casey. His manner was quiet; he gave an impression of shyness, though at the Garrick Club he was a popular member and a particularly keen bridge player. He was knighted in 1949 and was a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39920/', "Sir Donald Arthur Rolleston Albery")</script>, succeeded him in management. Albery died in London on 21 July 1971. On 1 January 1973 the New Theatre, the home of his greatest successes, was renamed the Albery.<br>
