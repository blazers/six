<span class="headword">Whaley,  Thomas</span>  (1766&#150;1800), <span class="occ">politician and gambler</span>, was born in Dublin on 15 December 1766, the eldest surviving son of the seven children of Richard Chapel Whaley (<i>c</i>.1700&#150;1769) of Dublin and Whaley Abbey, co. Wicklow, and his second wife, Anne (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1741), daughter of the Revd Bernard Ward, who had married in 1759. Whaley's father, who owned considerable property in Ulster and who was MP for co. Wicklow from 1747 to 1760, was nicknamed Burn Chapel Whaley during his lifetime because of the number of Roman Catholic chapels he is said to have destroyed by fire. Whaley was only two years old when his father died and he inherited estates worth &pound;7000 per annum, together with a lump sum of &pound;60,000. He attended school until he was sixteen, after which his mother sent him to France, accompanied by an indifferent tutor, to complete his education. After a series of adventures, which included his losing &pound;14,800 in one drunken gambling session and fathering an illegitimate child, he records that he returned to Dublin, escorted by his stepfather, John Richardson, and was &#145;treated like the prodigal son&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buck Whaley's Memoirs</span>, 33).<br>
<br>Whaley was elected MP for Newcastle, co. Dublin, in 1785 when he was only eighteen years old, and he represented that constituency until 1790. He made little impact on politics, and only came to notice when he moved an address to the lord lieutenant, the duke of Rutland, on the opening day of the session on 18 January 1787. Indeed, he admits that his early interest in politics soon waned, and that &#145;the dissipated life into which I afterwards plunged, soon put a period to this and every other serious and laudable application&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buck Whaley's Memoirs</span>, 276). It was at this stage in his career that he accepted a bizarre wager while attending a dinner at the duke of Leinster's town house. Upon being asked by one of the guests what part of the world he meant to visit next, he replied &#145;Jerusalem&#146;. Some of those present suggested that there was no such place then existing; others questioned the possibility of his getting there even if it were still in existence. Whaley then &#145;offered to bet any sum&#146; that he would go to Jerusalem and return to Dublin within two years from his departure. He soon had about &pound;15,000 depending on the outcome of the wager. On 20 September 1788 he set out for Deal, where his companion, Captain Wilson, joined him; they left that port on board the <i>London</i> on 7 October 1788. Although ill health soon halted Wilson's progress on the journey, Whaley met another friend, Captain Hugh Moore, who joined the expedition at Gibraltar. They left Smyrna for Acre on 3 February 1789 on board the <i>Heureuse Marie</i>, and reached Jerusalem on 28 February. Both returned triumphantly to Dublin in July 1789 amid bonfire celebrations, whereupon Whaley produced to his friends clear proof that he had visited the Holy City, and successfully claimed his reward. His journey to Jerusalem cost him &pound;8000 in expenses, leaving him a profit of &pound;7000; &#145;the only instance&#146;, he records, &#145;in all my life before, in which any of my projects turned out to my advantage&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buck Whaley's Memoirs</span>, 270). This globe-trotting adventure also earned him the title Jerusalem Whaley, and it was probably about this time that he acquired his alternative nickname, Buck.<br>
<br>After his expedition Whaley spent most of his time gambling and indulging in various acts of bravado, which were distinctive traits of a class of the gentry called &#145;Bucks&#146;. On one occasion, in Daly's Club, he successfully wagered that he would jump from the drawing-room windows of his mother's house in St Stephen's Green into the first barouche that passed, and kiss its occupant. He remained in Dublin for about two years, and during that time formed an acquaintance with a Miss Courtney (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1799), with whom he had two sons, Thomas and Richard, and a daughter, Sophia Isabella. Whaley then resided briefly in London before moving on to Paris, where he witnessed many scenes of the revolution in 1791. However, his stay there was short-lived because the worsening political unrest curtailed his gambling pursuits. A restless inquisitiveness next led him to Switzerland, where he moved comfortably in high society circles meeting, among others, the novelist William Beckford, the historian Edward Gibbon, and the duchess of Devonshire.<br>
<br>Following a short tour of Italy, Whaley returned to Paris to try to recover debts amounting to &pound;25,000. However, he soon found himself nearly penniless as a result of gambling losses and was obliged to flee to Ostend in disguise following a dispute with Count Arthur Dillon. He then made his way to London, only to be imprisoned in a sponging house. However, he was rescued from this predicament by the Irish lord chancellor, John Fitzgibbon, first earl of Clare, who had married his eldest sister, Anne, on 1 July 1786. Desperate to avoid any further embarrassment, Whaley proceeded to Dublin, where he sold all of his remaining estates for the discharge of his personal debts. He was left with a surplus of about &pound;5000, and he decided to gamble once more and either retrieve himself or complete his ruin. The outcome was disastrous, and he reflected: &#145;in the course of a few years I dissipated a fortune of near &pound;400,000, and contracted debts &hellip; of &pound;30,000 more &hellip; without ever purchasing or acquiring contentment or one hour's true happiness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buck Whaley's Memoirs</span>, 332).<br>
<br>After this calamity Whaley moved to the Isle of Man, where he wrote his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> in a spirit of contrition. However, he soon took up gambling again and his winnings were so substantial that he was able to begin building a luxurious mansion near Douglas&#151;Fort Anne&#151;which was near to completion in 1798. In that year he made a return to politics, paying &pound;4000 to secure his election for the borough of Enniscorthy, co. Wexford. Over the following two years he played his part in divisions concerning the parliamentary union with Great Britain. He supported the proposal for a union in 1799, no doubt influenced by his brother-in-law, Lord Clare, but in 1800 he was bribed by the opposition to oppose the measure. However, the opposition could not satisfy his rapacious demands, and he voted for a union once more. The government rewarded him with the office of escheator of Munster. His companion, Miss Courtney, died during his residence on the Isle of Man, and not long after he married Mary Catherine, daughter of Nicholas Lawless, first Baron Cloncurry (1733&#150;1799), and Margaret Browne (1748&#150;1795), in January 1800. However, his married life came to an abrupt end before the year was out. While on his way from Liverpool to London he caught a chill, which developed into rheumatic fever. He died, aged thirty-three, on 2 November 1800 at Knutsford in Cheshire, and was buried in Knutsford churchyard. His widow continued to live at Fort Anne, in charge of his three children, whom she brought up as her own.<br>
