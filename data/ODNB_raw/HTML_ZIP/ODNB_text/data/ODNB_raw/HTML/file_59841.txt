<span class="headword">Vachell,  Ada Marian</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Sister Ada]</span>  (1866&#150;1923), <span class="occ">worker for disabled people</span>, was born on 27 December 1866, at 14 Charles Street, Cardiff, daughter of William Vachell (1827&#150;1910), iron merchant and three times mayor of Cardiff, and his wife, Marian or Mary Anne, daughter of William Fedden of Clifton. Scarlet fever claimed the lives of two of Ada's brothers and left her frail and partially deaf, and shortly afterwards, about 1875, she, her parents, and a surviving younger son, Arthur, moved to her mother's home city of Bristol. After a patchy education Ada began charitable work in Bristol, but it was not until 1895 that she began the work with disabled people which was to dominate her life. Physical disability then condemned sufferers to a life of economic dependence and social isolation, and chronic pain compounded by boredom often led to drunkenness. In 1895 Miss Vachell visited Grace Thyrza Kimmins's Guild of the Brave Poor Things, which was inspired by Mrs (Juliana Horatia) Ewing's <span class="italic">Story of a Short Life</span> (1885). Her &#145;cripples&#146; were emboldened with flags and banners to fight the misery and dependence which their conditions brought and to be &#145;Laetus sorte mea&#146; (&#145;happy in my lot&#146;).<br>
<br>Vachell took the idea to Bristol and founded the Guild of the Poor Things there on 13 February 1896. Sister Ada, as she became known, began social meetings for disabled people to combat boredom and isolation, and went on to place many of them (boys more easily than girls) in apprenticeships, the guild paying the premium, and to take on summer country holidays as many as she could (82 in 1899, and 147 by 1904). With medals and mottoes, flags and banners, &#145;cripples&#146; were encouraged to &#145;face about manfully and bear cheerfully what inevitable hardness life holds. But though we feel this, it can never lessen our deep pity, our lovingest sympathy. Life is not easy to any Poor Thing. They are all men and women&#151;even little children of sorrows. They are all acquainted with grief&#146;  (Unwin, 123). She had a band of voluntary helpers, but she always remained at the heart of the guild, doing everything from raising money to visiting disabled people in the workhouse.<br>
<br>With help from guild members who had found work, and from factory girls of the Hand-in-Hand social club which Miss Vachell had earlier helped to run, the guild grew steadily, reaching 200 members in 1906. From its first premises in Stratton Street, it moved to Broad Plain by March 1896. In May 1906 it opened a purpose-built holiday home at Churchill, Somerset, and on 27 June 1913 opened purpose-built premises at the Guild Heritage, Braggs Lane, Bristol. In 1899 Miss Vachell helped to found the Bristol Invalid Children's School, which was modelled on Mrs Humphry Ward's work at the Passmore Edwards Settlement in Tavistock Place, London.<br>
<br>Sister Ada seems to have been a quite remarkable person&#151;undogmatic, non-judgemental, hard-working, cheerful, compassionate, and able to see and solve problems. A devout Christian, she worshipped with Anglicans, Unitarians, and Quakers alike, and demanded of her guild members allegiance to no particular creed. A convinced abstainer, she organized a temperance group within the guild, but membership was optional, and she wrote of a woman who had drunk herself to death, &#145;There's a great content that we haven't to sort out the good and evil in people, haven't to judge, <i>can't</i> judge,&#151;but that with God all is seen and allowed for and understood&#146;  (Unwin, 41). The name Poor Things had been her choice, but she was happy to change it to the Guild of the Handicapped after young male members found the expression &#145;poor things&#146; hindered their chance of finding work. From comfortable circumstances and physically weak, she undertook exhausting manual work, such as giving daily baths to twenty guild members on holiday in a farmhouse with no bathroom. She talked of soldierly discipline and decked her meeting-rooms with flags and banners, but ensured that guild holidays were marked by freedom and lack of rules, and remarked of her members that &#145;Heroes are with us yet, and some live upon parish pay&#146;  (Unwin, 49).<br>
<br>Miss Vachell, who as well as pursuing her voluntary work kept an interest in the theatre and advocated women's suffrage, died suddenly of pneumonia on 29 December 1923 at her home, Foley Cottage, Hampton Road, Clifton, Bristol. After a funeral service attended by weeping crowds at Bristol Cathedral on 2 January 1924, her body was cremated at Golders Green crematorium the next day. A tablet raised in the cathedral to her memory bears the guild emblem of crutch and sword. Nearly one hundred years later the state had taken over much of the guild's work, and its administration costs per member were becoming too large. It was decided to cease activity from January 1987 and use the guild's by then considerable assets to give grants to individual disabled people so that Miss Vachell's work would continue.<br>
