<span class="headword">Arbuthnot <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fane]</span>,  Harriett</span>  (1793&#150;1834), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was born on 10 September 1793, the third and youngest daughter and third youngest of the ten children of Henry Fane (1739&#150;1802) MP of Fulbeck Hall, Lincolnshire (second son of Thomas Fane, eighth earl of Westmorland), and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1838), daughter of Edward Buckley Batson, banker. She was baptized at Fulbeck on 2 November 1793. On 31 January 1814 she married (as his second wife) <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/607/', "Charles Arbuthnot (1767&#150;1850)")</script>, MP and joint secretary to the treasury with responsibility for patronage. There were no children. Despite the age gap&#151;she was twenty-six years his junior&#151;they had twenty years of extremely happy marriage.<br>
<br>Her obsession with politics partly explains her choice of the middle-aged widower as a husband, since he was the recipient of political secrets, which she shared. He was &#145;more largely mixed up with the principal people and events of his time than any other man&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Greville Memoirs, 1814&#150;1860</span>, ed. G. L. Strachey and R. Fulford, 8 vols., 1938). While Arbuthnot was tactful and exceedingly good-natured, his wife was equally discreet but with a sharper mind. She was soon well known in her own right as the friend of statesmen. Her valuable political diary, however, was secreted in her room until her death, then kept at Apsley House; it was not published until 1950, when it appeared in two volumes as <span class="italic">The Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot</span>.<br>
<br>An extreme tory, Mrs Arbuthnot passed her adult life mainly under tory governments. This gave her the entr&eacute;e into many whispering galleries of politics and the drawing-rooms if not the corridors of power. When the whigs returned to power she lost interest and in 1832 dropped the journal abruptly in mid-sentence. She had decided on the fourth day of George IV's reign, 1 February 1820, to overcome her natural &#145;laziness&#146; and keep a diary. Eight days later the duke of Wellington was calling on her with reports of a coming clash over the king's desired divorce from Queen Caroline. Mingling genuine news with &#145;street talk&#146;, she produced a lively compilation. Among the important events she dealt with were the Cato Street conspiracy, Queen Caroline's trial, Catholic emancipation, and parliamentary reform.<br>
<br>The two heroes of the journal are Lord Castlereagh and Wellington. Mrs Arbuthnot's admiration for Castlereagh was entirely uncritical: his &#145;dignity and nobleness&#146; were &#145;never seen in any other man&#146;. The modified toryism of George Canning and Sir Robert Peel filled her with contempt. Canning, she wrote, was &#145;always having some dirty underplot&#146;. Towards Wellington she could be both critical and devoted, and her portrait of him is the most useful.<br>
<br>The Arbuthnots and Wellingtons had met in Paris in 1814. Their friendship has been called a unique political <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i>. If things had been otherwise, Mrs Arbuthnot would have made an ideal wife for the duke. He liked a clever woman&#151;&#145;she sees what you mean&#146;&#151;which his wife, Kitty, did not. Nor was his wife &#145;sensible&#146; like Harriett, who found Kitty &#145;silly&#146;. This was not sexual jealousy, though Charles Greville sent Harriett an anonymous letter accusing her of being in love with Wellington. Their relations are best described as <i>amiti&eacute; amoureuse</i>. Both Wellington and Harriett lacked imagination but relied instead on keen observation. Unlike Wellington, Harriett was a political animal through and through, whose ambition was that her men should succeed. Harriett, said Arbuthnot, had been his &#145;guardian angel&#146;, looking after everything, including his finances. After she died the heart-broken husband gave Woodford Lodge, Northamptonshire, where Harriett had spent her married life, to his son by his first wife, and went to live with Wellington. It was a no less remarkable <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; deux</i>. The memory of her graceful figure, wide-apart eyes, heart-shaped face, and alert expression remained their joint possession until Arbuthnot's death in 1850. Renowned in life for her guarded silences, Harriett Arbuthnot speaks out now through the pages of the <span class="italic">Journal</span>. She died of cholera on 2 August 1834 at her home, Woodford Lodge.<br>
