<span class="headword">Aiscough <span class="st"> [Ayscough]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1395&#150;1450), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Salisbury</span>, was the son of Robert Aiscough, of Potgrange, near Masham, Yorkshire, and brother of Robert, who became dean of the Chapel Royal. Ordained in 1415, he was master of arts by 1423 and doctor of theology by 1432, both probably of Cambridge. From 1429, as the court of Henry VI was increasingly the focus of his activities, he was presented to a number of benefices, including prebends of Lincoln Cathedral, the king's free chapel of Bridgworth, and St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster. His post of royal chaplain must have assisted him in his elevation, by papal provision, to the bishopric of Salisbury on 12 February 1438. He was consecrated on 20 July at Windsor. He subsequently became the king's confessor, an unprecedented post for one who was already a bishop: frequently in the royal presence, he may have been a principal source of edifying information for John Blacman's life of Henry VI. During the 1440s he loaned the king &pound;1602 and was active in making arrangements for the twin royal foundations of Eton and King's College&#151;he was one of the compilers of the latter's statutes. He provided prebends in his diocese for several servants of the royal household and made Adam Moleyns (<i>d</i>. 1450), another leading royal councillor, an archdeacon and canon at Salisbury in 1439. His unpublished register shows him to have concerned himself regularly with diocesan affairs and the maintenance of orthodoxy, a different picture from the one often painted of the courtier&#150;bishop.<br>
<br>As a regular member of the royal council he was inevitably associated with some of the government's most sensitive policies: in 1441 he was involved in the arraignment of the duchess of Gloucester and her associates for witchcraft. He accompanied Suffolk on an embassy to France in 1444 &#145;in the mater of pees&#146;, and the following year he officiated at the marriage of Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou at Titchfield Abbey, Hampshire. In 1447 he was implicated in the arrest of Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and was one of those blamed by the people for the duke's suspicious death. His membership of the inner circle of royal advisers made him dangerously unpopular. In 1447 it was alleged that he had endangered the succession to the throne, by discouraging the king from having &#145;his sport&#146; with Queen Margaret, and in January 1450 he was one of those whom a yeoman of Westminster had plotted to behead. He was threatened in a gloating poem on the death of Suffolk; &#145;&#147;Heu mei&#148;, saith Salisbury &#147;this gothe to ferre forthe&#148;&#146;  (Wright, 2.232), and in several of Cade's manifestos was among those roundly condemned as the king's evil councillors. This climate of hatred seems to have persuaded him to leave London for the apparent safety of his castle in Sherborne. On his way there his baggage was plundered and then, on 29 June, he was captured by a large group of local men while celebrating mass at the church of the Bonshommes, Edington, Wiltshire. He was dragged out onto a hill, hacked to death, and despoiled. In the following days his palace at Salisbury and several episcopal manors were ransacked. The goods taken were valued at 10,000 marks, &#145;as thay saide that knewe it&#146;  (<span class="italic">An English Chronicle</span>, 64). His death can be seen less as a manifestation of anti-clericalism or a protest against absenteeism than as a major incident in a series of provincial revolts that followed the Kentish rising of Cade. He also appears to have had, like his predecessors, an uneasy relationship with the civic authorities of Salisbury, who resented his assertion of ecclesiastical property rights. Leland records that he was buried at the Bonshommes but no memorial survives, nor does a will, but he gave two manuscripts to Eton and owned a copy of the <span class="italic">Sermones</span> of Richard Fitzralph.<br>
