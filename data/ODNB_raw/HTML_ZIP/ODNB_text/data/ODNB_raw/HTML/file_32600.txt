<span class="headword">Cox,  Alfred</span>  (1866&#150;1954), <span class="occ">medical administrator</span>, was born on 5 May 1866 at Middlesbrough, the second son in the family of eight children of Thomas Benjamin Cox, a bridgeyard worker, and his wife, Dinah Sanderson Skilbeck, a blacksmith's daughter. He was an unhealthy child. Shortly after his birth the family moved to Darlington, where at the age of fourteen Cox was made a monitor of Albert Road board school as a step to becoming a pupil teacher. This was not a success, and at the age of seventeen he began to study for the civil service lower division, work he continued while staying in Carlisle as assistant to an insurance agent. It was there that a doctor visiting the house persuaded him to become a dispenser assistant; this provided a mode of entry to the medical profession later forbidden by the General Medical Council. Cox gained a good deal of experience in midwifery and moved first to Stockton-on-Tees and later to Haydon Bridge, where he had more time for study; finally he moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where he received free board and lodging and &pound;1 a month from the general practitioner for whom he worked.<br>
<br>Despite this somewhat precarious existence Cox managed to matriculate at Edinburgh and on his twenty-first birthday he entered the University of Durham College of Medicine at Newcastle&#151;still earning his keep as a dispenser assistant. He qualified MB, BS in 1891 and, with a capital of &pound;30, immediately entered general practice in Gateshead. In 1894 he married Florence Amelia (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of Thomas Cheesman, iron merchant, of Newcastle upon Tyne. The marriage was childless. Cox served as district medical officer to the Gateshead poor-law union. In this capacity he gave evidence to the royal commission on the poor laws and relief of distress (April 1907). Shortly before he left Gateshead, in 1908, he became a factory surgeon.<br>
<br>Cox's long years of penurious drudgery probably stimulated his interest in medical politics and the reform of his profession. He played an active part in local politics in Gateshead, and was elected to its municipal council. With the rector of Gateshead he joined forces in a campaign for slum clearance. He was also a justice of the peace. In 1898 Cox formed the Gateshead Medical Association, and tried to reform club practice and the methods used by friendly societies in appointing doctors for their members. He was active in forming in other towns in the north various medical societies for discussing medico-political and medico-ethical matters. These provided a focus for the expression of dissatisfaction with the British Medical Association (BMA), which Cox had joined in 1893. A conference held by the Medical Guild of Manchester in May 1900 brought this dissatisfaction into the open, and the possibility of forming a new organization was debated. It was Cox who carried the day with a motion which gave the BMA a chance to reform itself, and the result of this was the setting up in the same year of the committee which brought in the new constitution of the BMA, which to all intents and purposes remained unchanged until the reforms adopted in 1966. Cox was a member of the constitution committee from 1900 to 1902.<br>
<br>Sidney and Beatrice Webb described the new BMA constitution of 1903 as a model of democratic organization. The culminating structure of this was the representative body, which at the annual representative meeting laid down the policy of the BMA. Cox was a representative from the beginning and the first honorary secretary of the Gateshead division, which replaced the Gateshead Medical Association he had formed. He was also honorary secretary of the north of England branch between 1902 and 1908, and its president in 1908. When the appointment of medical secretary to the BMA was being considered Cox was canvassed as a likely candidate, but he withdrew in favour of James Smith Whitaker, who was appointed in 1902. In the same year Cox was elected a member of the BMA's council on which he served until 1903. Cox was also a member of the parliamentary bills (later medico-politico) committee between 1899 and 1903 and again in 1907&#150;8. In 1908 Cox became deputy secretary of the BMA, at an initial salary of &pound;500 p.a., and gave up medical practice. When Smith Whitaker took office as deputy chairman of the National Health Insurance Commission in 1911, Cox succeeded him, being formally appointed medical secretary of the BMA in 1912.<br>
<br>One of Cox's first tasks in his new position was to represent the association as a witness before the select committee on patent medicines between 1912 and 1914. The introduction of national health insurance by Lloyd George was accompanied by a bitter struggle between the BMA and the government, and Smith Whitaker's decision to leave the BMA at the height of this was the subject of much criticism. But Cox at the time, and in the years to come, never ceased to defend his action. During the crisis, especially after he succeeded Smith Whitaker, Cox took on arduous and anxious duties, not least in trying to maintain professional unity in an atmosphere of distrust and reproach. He also played an important role in negotiating the system of professional consultation which allowed the new scheme to function efficiently. Following its introduction Cox became an enthusiastic supporter of national health insurance.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Cox acted as joint secretary of the central medical war committee set up to organize the supply of doctors to the armed forces. For this he was appointed OBE in 1918. The war over, much of his work as secretary of the BMA was concerned with negotiations between the medical profession and the Ministry of Health, and with the administration of a professional organization which over the years grew in numbers and strength. He also conducted an investigation into practice conditions in Britain, the findings of which influenced the BMA's proposals for a general medical service for the nation. As ambassador for the BMA he was successful in securing the allegiance to the home organization of doctors in Canada, which he visited in 1924 and 1930, and in South Africa, which he visited in 1925. In both countries there had been branches of the BMA and separate medical associations as well. By the time Cox died in 1954, the Canadian Medical Association and the South African Medical Association had become affiliated to the BMA. Another successful attempt to cement friendship among doctors of different countries was the formation in 1925 of the Association Professionnelle Internationale des M&eacute;decins (APIM); Cox was a co-founder and also one of its most enthusiastic supporters. After the Second World War the APIM was merged into a bigger organization, the World Medical Association.<br>
<br>Cox devoted much of his life to the welfare and interests of his profession, and in the British Medical Association he found a powerful instrument to that end. He retired as medical secretary in 1932, the year of the BMA's centenary, having stayed in office a year beyond retirement age in order to oversee the celebrations. On retirement Cox received a cheque for &pound;1000 along with a book containing the names of some 7000 subscribers to his testimonial fund. He was made vice-president of the association in 1933. After leaving the BMA, Cox occupied a variety of positions. He was part-time general secretary of the British Health Resorts Association (1933&#150;8); chairman of the advisory council, medical section, British Industries House; part-time medical secretary of the London public medical service; medical adviser to the Proprietary Association of Great Britain; and, until the age of eighty, acting secretary to the National Ophthalmic Treatment Board (1941&#150;6).<br>
<br>Beneath a rather stern exterior Cox had a warm and generous heart which kept him free from the jealousies which so often beset professional life. He seldom missed an opportunity to encourage younger colleagues. He was a man of great integrity, and up to the end of his long life he kept his friendships in constant repair and his interests undimmed. Early in his career he was a member of the Independent Labour Party, being greatly influenced by Keir Hardie, whom he knew personally. But he later became disillusioned with socialism. &#145;The end of it all&#146;, he wrote in his autobiography, &#145;seems inevitably to be the authoritarian State&#146;  (Cox, 221). He was a vigorous opponent of Bevan's <span class="roman">National Health Service Bill</span>, suggesting that it was a step on the road to national socialism and to the transformation of the minister of health into a &#145;medical Fuehrer&#146;.<br>
<br>Cox wrote numerous articles for the medical press. He received the honorary degrees of LLD, from the University of Manitoba in 1930, and MA, from Durham in 1921. The BMA awarded him its gold medal in 1931. After several years of poor health and failing eyesight, Cox died in a nursing home at 54 Marine Parade, Brighton on 31 August 1954. His body was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 4 September, and there was a memorial service at St Pancras parish church on 16 September.<br>
