<span class="headword">Belzoni,  Sarah</span>  (1783&#150;1870), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was born (probably Sarah Banne) in January 1783 in Bristol. Nothing is known of her before her marriage in 1803 to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2072/', "Giovanni Battista Belzoni (1778&#150;1823)")</script>, the actor, strongman, and, later, Egyptologist. She travelled, and possibly worked with him, all over the British Isles, and in 1815 accompanied him to Egypt. There she lived with him in tombs or temples and on small boats on the Nile, or alone with the local people. They had no family.<br>
<br>Mrs Belzoni loyally followed her husband whenever she could, but she also had a life of her own. She spent many, often lonely, weeks, sometimes months, with the local women, writing of her life with them and of their way of life in &#145;Mrs Belzoni's trifling account of the women of Egypt, Nubia and Syria&#146;, published in her husband's <span class="italic">Narrative of the Operations and Recent Discoveries &hellip; in Egypt and Nubia</span> (1820). Hers was the first such record, and covered a greater variety of people than Sophia Lane Poole's later, more erudite study in <span class="italic">The Englishwoman in Egypt</span> (1844).<br>
<br>In 1816 at Aswan and Abu Simbel, Sarah visited the women of the chiefs. The aga of Aswan, she said, like other Egyptian men, treated his women with the greatest contempt, although always behaving to her &#145;not only with respect, but even with humility&#146;  (Belzoni, 410). She described the women's relationships, rooms, possessions, and dress, finding the Nubian women more kind and civil with less of the &#145;invidious jealousy and covetousness the Arab women possess&#146;  (ibid., 413). On their return to Luxor, Belzoni left her in an Arab house on her own with &#145;about twenty Arab words in my mouth&#146;  (ibid., 416) and no interpreter. All the village women came to look at her and, when she suffered a long and severe attack of ophthalmia, to help her. In June 1817 she rejoined Belzoni at Philae as he was setting off to enter the temple at Abu Simbel. She wished to go too, but he insisted she remain on the island. &#145;Had I been there,&#146; she said, &#145;I should have helped to remove the sand as well as them &hellip; and claimed as much merit&#146;  (ibid., 418). Instead she camped on top of the temple with their Irish servant. The village women came daily to look, talk, and trade antique beads for modern ones.<br>
<br>In January 1818 Sarah persuaded Belzoni to let her visit the Holy Land. She arrived in Jerusalem in mid-March to witness the last days of Passion week. In May she joined the Jordan pilgrimage, rejecting other European travellers as she &#145;made it an invariable rule to be independent of everyone, that it might not be said, if it had not been for &hellip; <i>us</i>, she could not have gone on&#146;  (Belzoni, 424). However, she then travelled with Lord Belmore's party to Nazareth, but returned to Jerusalem on her own, staying in the shepherds' black tents and in a common caravanserai. She determined to enter the great Muslim temple&#151;barred to both Christians and women. Dressed as a man she achieved her purpose, in mid-June 1818, but quickly left Jerusalem lest the adventure be discovered and she be punished.<br>
<br>In November 1818, back at Luxor, while Belzoni was at Philae collecting an obelisk for William Bankes, she lived in a tomb again and saved the famed Seti I's tomb from flood damage. Reunited with Belzoni, she settled at Rosetta while Belzoni went off to the Libyan desert. Here she amused herself with several pets, including chameleons, and by distributing <span class="roman">Bibles</span>. The Belzonis left Egypt in 1819.<br>
<br>On their return to London in 1820 after some months on the continent, Sarah helped Belzoni with his Egyptian exhibition (1820&#150;21) and finally travelled to Morocco with him to bid him farewell as he set off south in 1823 for Benin and his death. She continued to promote his achievements, living on a meagre income for another forty-five years, in England and from 1833 in Brussels. She organized an exhibition in London of his models and drawings of Seti's tomb, but it was unsuccessful and closed in 1825. In 1828 she tried but failed to publish his lithographs of the tomb. In 1851 she was awarded a small civil-list pension in recognition of Belzoni's service to the nation. Although there was &#145;nothing remarkable in her person or manners&#146;, Sarah was said to have &#145;a sensible and intrepid cast of features&#146;  (Smith). She died in Bellozanne Road, Jersey, in the Channel Islands, on 12 January 1870, aged eighty-seven. Sarah Belzoni's account, while it is somewhat &#145;trifling&#146;, personal, and unorganized, reveals a valiant, enterprising woman who had exceptional experiences for her day.<br>
