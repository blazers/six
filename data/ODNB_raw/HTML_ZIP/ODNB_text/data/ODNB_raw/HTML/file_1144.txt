<span class="headword">Baker,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1742, <em>d.</em> 1785), <span class="occ">printer and classical scholar</span>, was baptized on 5 April 1742 at St Mary, Reading, the son of William Baker, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox. His father had hoped for a career in the church for him, encouraged in this by Dr Robert Bolton, dean of Carlisle, who had virtually assured the young William a university place. When Bolton was unable to fulfil his promise, Baker was apprenticed to Joseph Kippax, printer of Cullum Street, London. He was not only diligent in Kippax's employ, often working overtime, but he also used his free hours to good purpose, buying books and studying. He eventually made himself proficient in Greek and Latin, as well as in Italian and French, and attained some knowledge of Hebrew. He tended to overt-exert himself, however, and before he was twenty-one he suffered a severe illness. While there is no sale catalogue of his library, there is evidence in his two major publications that he acquired a respectable library of classical and other works. When Kippax died, Baker took over the business, later moving to Ingram Court, Fenchurch Street, in the City of London and forming a partnership with John William Galabin.<br>
<br>Baker's <span class="italic">Peregrinations of the Mind</span> (1770) is a series of twenty-three essays on such various topics as war, the stage, matrimony, in defence of theatrical humour. Each is headed by a motto from Greek, Latin, and English authors; Baker translated the classical mottoes, including the originals in an appendix. There are also many footnotes in various languages. In 1783 Baker printed his <span class="italic">Theses Graecae et Latinae selectae</span>, a compendium of his notes compiled over years of reading the works of classical writers. He made many friends among antiquaries and scholars of his day, including Oliver Goldsmith, Dr Edmund Barker, James Merrick, Hugh Farmer, and C&eacute;sar de Missy.<br>
<br>Baker again suffered from his tendency to over-exert himself, this time from walking, in December 1784. Following a nine-month illness he died in London of an enlargement of the omentum on 29 September 1785.<br>
<br>William Baker was buried in the vault of St Dionis Backchurch, Lime Street and Fenchurch Street, London. A Latin inscription to his memory was placed on a family tomb in St Mary Church, Reading. His library became the property of the physician and philanthropist Dr J. C. Lettsom (1744&#150;1815).<br>
