<span class="headword">Stevenson,  Louisa</span>  (1835&#150;1908), <span class="occ">campaigner for women's rights</span>, was born in Glasgow on 15 July 1835, one of the numerous children of James Stevenson (1786&#150;1866), who became senior partner of the Jarrow Chemical Company of South Shields, and his wife, Jane Stewart Shannan. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48323/', "James Cochran Stevenson")</script>, who took over the chemical business, was her eldest brother; another brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36289/', "John James Stevenson")</script>. In 1854, when James Stevenson retired from business, the family moved to Edinburgh, where he became an elder in St George's Free Church and regularly entertained ministers visiting the city during meetings of the general assembly. His wife, an invalid, died soon after the move to Edinburgh, and in 1859 he set up house at 13 Randolph Crescent. This was to be the home of the four unmarried Stevenson sisters for most of the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>The Stevenson sisters, who were left financially well provided for by their father, have been identified, along with the McLaren and Mair families, as one of the three Edinburgh households that played a crucial role in the women's movement in mid-Victorian Scotland  (Leneman, 11). Alone of the sisters, the eldest, Jane (1828&#150;1904), never attended public meetings, though she was a dominant influence in the household. The second unmarried sister, Elisa Carlile Stevenson (1829&#150;1904), who suffered depression later in life, was one of the earliest members of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage, founded in November 1867 under the presidency of Priscilla McLaren. Louisa Stevenson was a member of the Ladies' Edinburgh Essay Society and through this became involved in the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association, which organized university classes for women. Both she and her younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46826/', "Flora Clift Stevenson")</script> attended David Masson's first course of lectures to women in 1868. She was one of the honorary treasurers of the committee that raised funds to pay for Sophie Jex-Blake's legal costs in her campaign to open medical education to women.<br>
<br>In 1875 Louisa Stevenson, who was a qualified needlework teacher, was one of the founders of the Edinburgh School of Cookery, and was honorary treasurer until 1891, when it became the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic Economy. The school started as a series of lectures, demonstrations, and practical classes given by an instructress trained at the National School of Cookery, South Kensington. Louisa Stevenson encouraged the establishment of other local cookery schools, and in 1876 visited Newcastle where she successfully persuaded local women to set up a school.<br>
<br>Louisa Stevenson was the first woman to be elected a poor-law guardian in Edinburgh. She was particularly concerned about improving the standard of nursing in the city poorhouse, and sometimes paid surprise visits late in the evening to check that the inmates were being properly cared for. One such inspection, in the company of another woman guardian, led to the discovery of the governor in a state of inebriation and brought about his dismissal. She helped in the running of the Scottish branch of the Jubilee Nurses' Institution and the colonial nursing scheme. She was elected a member of the board of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, as one of the first women to serve on a hospital board. A male colleague on the board, initially hostile to women members, was compelled by her example to change his mind, &#145;as Miss Stevenson was the most useful Member the Board had had all the twenty years he had been a Manager&#146;  (McLaren, 15). She described her work on the board at the 1900 conference of the National Union of Women Workers, commenting that &#145;The general qualifications of women to serve on hospital or other boards are precisely the same as those of men, although each has a valuable special experience which the other has not and which would be lost without the services of both&#146;  (National Council of Women of Great Britain, <span class="italic">Women Workers: the Papers Read at the Conference Held at Brighton</span>, 1900).<br>
<br>Louisa Stevenson was one of the moving spirits in the Edinburgh Association for the University Education of Women, which achieved its goal in 1892 when Scottish universities were finally opened to women. She donated &pound;1000 to the appeal to raise funds for a hall of residence for women students in Edinburgh. Masson Hall, named after Professor Masson, a supporter of the women's campaign, opened in November 1897, with Louisa Stevenson as its first honorary secretary and Sarah Mair as treasurer. In 1906 Edinburgh University conferred on her the honorary degree of LLD in recognition of her struggles for women's higher education, and although extremely frail from a painful illness she was present at the graduation ceremony to hear Sir Ludovic Grant's tribute to her as &#145;strenuous in action, tenacious of purpose, and of high courage&#146;  (McLaren, 11).<br>
<br>Louisa Stevenson was a lifelong supporter of the women's suffrage cause, and in the 1890s was on the executive committee of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In May 1906 she was an Edinburgh representative on the deputation of women's suffragists to the prime minister, Henry Campbell-Bannerman. A close friend referred to her work for women's causes as &#145;in very truth a religion, though of an inarticulate and unconventional type&#146;  (McLaren, 20). Her knowledge of business and her administrative talent made her a good organizer. Confident in a public role, she made effective use of what contemporaries described as a beautiful speaking voice. She was by all accounts a determined woman who &#145;brooked no opposition&#146;; her &#145;intellectual and moral energy supplied the dynamite which hurled away obstacles&#146;  (McLaren, 18). Louisa Stevenson died at 13 Randolph Crescent, Edinburgh, on 13 May 1908.<br>
