<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Taylor,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1710&#150;1758), <span class="occ">pugilist and showman</span>, made his first appearances as a combatant in his teens in the early days of the sport when boxing was only just separating itself from swordplay and cudgelling. He fought at the amphitheatre, half great fairground booth and half theatre, which had been opened by James Figg on the Oxford Road, London, in 1719. Taylor joined its band of well-known boxers, which included the Gypsy &#145;Prince&#146; Boswell, Tom Smallwood, and John Smith, unflatteringly known as &#145;Buckhorse&#146; from his appearance. Above all there was Jack Broughton, already famous for one athletic feat in winning the annual Doggett's Coat and Badge rowing race for watermen, and soon to be celebrated as pugilism's first rule maker and earliest undisputed champion.<br>
<br>George Taylor, a strong, shifty fighter with a powerful wrestling throw, was still prepared to begin contests in the old-fashioned way with a spell of swordplay. In 1734, shortly after Figg's death and while still in his early twenties, he took over the management of the amphitheatre. As a manager and showman he enjoyed considerable success. His advertisements for the amphitheatre were always lurid with the promise of blood and he used the press to put out heated challenges and counter-challenges from supposedly enraged fighters. The crowds flocked in and, as Taylor charged an expensive 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for entrance, a day's takings of &pound;150 was not uncommon. He was, moreover, calling himself the &#145;champion&#146;, conveniently ignoring the fact that Jack Broughton had beaten him just before he took over the running of the amphitheatre and had also been victorious over all comers. At the start of the 1740s everything appeared to be set fair for Taylor; he won plaudits for a successful fight against Boswell and his business was flourishing, but Broughton split with him in 1742 and a year later, with powerful backing led by the duke of Cumberland, opened a new amphitheatre of his own, much more comfortable than Taylor's spartan establishment and furnished with boxes and a viewing gallery. Moreover, it was virtually adjacent to Taylor's premises and Broughton timed its opening to clash with a contest between Taylor and James Field, adding insult to injury by undercutting his rival's prices and charging no more than 1<i>s</i>. for entry.<br>
<br>The new venture was an immediate success. There was a bitter war of words in the press with Taylor at length falsely accusing Broughton of taking more than the proprietor's usual one-third share of the takings, a charge that was quickly shown to be false. There was little left for Taylor but to close his own theatre and cross over to Broughton's, taking his fighters with him. It was a great setback from which he never recovered and after a few years he left the amphitheatre to become landlord of The Fountain inn, Deptford. Like too many of his successors in the ring, however, he decided to fight again, taking up the challenge of Tom Faulkner whom he had beaten twice in the past but who now sensed a chance for revenge. They fought on 5 August 1758 near St Albans for 200 guineas and the gate money. It was a long, hard struggle which ended with defeat for the ageing Taylor. Both of his eyes were closed from bruising. His pride was finally shattered and he died a few months later in December.<br>
