<span class="headword">Penrose,  Harald James</span>  (1904&#150;1996), <span class="occ">airman</span>, was born at 103 Park Street, Hereford, on 12 April 1904, the son of James Penrose, an Inland Revenue clerk, and his wife, Elizabeth Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnson. At the age of five he became enamoured with flight after his father showed him a picture of the monoplane in which Louis Bl&eacute;riot had just flown the channel. Two years later he was lifted a few feet aloft beneath a Cody-type kite. Several encounters with pioneer aeroplanes sustained his ambition to fly, not realized until 1919 in a war-surplus Avro 504K in which the former Royal Flying Corps pilot Alan Cobham was giving joyrides from a field in Reading. Failing to find employment with an aircraft manufacturer, Penrose pursued a four-year aeronautical course at the Northampton Engineering College of London University. All four students on the course gained diplomas, but Penrose was the only one to pass an early City and Guilds examination in aeronautics. In September 1926 he joined the Westland Aircraft Works at Yeovil, Somerset, and by the new year he was overseeing the construction of the Widgeon III light sporting monoplane.<br>
<br>In 1927 Penrose obtained a commission in the Reserve of Air Force Officers (RAFO) and learned to fly in a Bristol type 73 trainer at the Bristol Flying School. After six hours' dual he went solo, progressing to a Jupiter-engined advanced trainer variant of the Bristol fighter. He then returned to Westland gazetted as a pilot officer RAFO, gained his private pilot's A licence in the same year, and made his first flights for Westland in the Widgeon. By March 1928, although he had less than 100 hours' total piloting experience, Penrose was authorized to fly a number of the company's new machines. He was also acting as a flight-test observer, and later that year was made manager of Westland's newly established civil aircraft department, overseeing development of the W.IV and Wessex tri-motor feeder liners. In October he qualified for his commercial pilot's B licence. On 23 March 1929, in Reading, he married Nora Sybil Bailey (1903/4&#150;1986); they had a son and a daughter. That same year he also added responsibility for the technical side of civil sales to his company duties.<br>
<br>In 1930 Penrose began flying the Wapiti general-purpose military two-seater, and early in the following year he was entrusted with demonstrating a variant in South America in landplane and seaplane configurations. Shortly after his return, in May 1931, Westland's pilot in charge, Captain Louis Paget, suffered serious injuries in a crash, and Penrose was asked to fulfil Paget's duties&#151;with no increase in pay, though his insurance coverage was increased. In his autobiography he recalled: &#145;It just seemed wonderful that Westland was letting me have extensive free flying which I would otherwise have been unable to afford&#146;. When it transpired that Paget was permanently crippled, Penrose was appointed chief test pilot.<br>
<br>In the succeeding twenty-two years Penrose made the initial test flights of all of the Westland aircraft types, most notably the unconventional Pterodactyl series of tailless monoplanes designed by Captain Geoffrey Hill, the Houston-Westland PV3 which in April 1933 made the first flight over Everest, and the Lysander army co-operation aircraft used for flying agents into and out of enemy territory during the Second World War. On 24 August 1934 he became the first pilot to bale out of an enclosed-cockpit aeroplane when the Westland P7 general-purpose monoplane he was flying suffered a disastrous in-flight structural failure. When suction forces jammed the sliding roof, he was forced to make his exit through a side window. Production test-flying intensified with the outbreak of war. In October 1938 Penrose made the maiden flight of the new Whirlwind twin-engine fighter, which proved a disappointment. A one-off experiment was tried in the form of a tandem-wing version of the Lysander, which Penrose looped on its maiden flight in July 1944, but no development ensued. Penrose also carried out the production flight tests of other manufacturers' aircraft built under licence by Westland: Supermarine Spitfires and Seafires, Fairey Barracudas, and lend-lease Curtiss Mohawk and Tomahawk fighters. The last wartime design to emanate from Westland, the Welkin high-altitude fighter, proved a troublesome mount for Penrose and his fellow pilots.<br>
<br>By far the most notorious aeroplane flown by Penrose, however, was the turboprop-powered Wyvern naval fighter, which suffered from being a new airframe married to new and under-developed engines. This large single-seater, first flown on 16 December 1946, cost the lives of three test pilots during its protracted development. Only his quick and instinctive reactions saved Penrose from becoming another victim when a Wyvern in which he was returning to Yeovil suffered a failed aileron linkage and turned over on its back.<br>
<br>In 1953 Penrose was appointed sales manager of Westland Aircraft Ltd, responsible for the Westland, Bristol, and Saunders-Roe helicopter group. By this time he had amassed some 5000 hours on no fewer than 250 different aircraft types, ranging from rotorcraft to jets. He continued flying for pleasure, acquiring a diminutive Currie Wot biplane after his retirement in 1967, and sampling other types whenever the opportunity arose. Penrose was also a keen ornithologist and a naval architect (he designed thirty-six boats and yachts), and he designed the house at Nether Compton, Dorset, in which he and his wife lived for fifty years.<br>
<br>Gifted with an elegant prose style rare in aviation writers, Penrose wrote a number of books. His outstanding autobiographical works were <span class="italic">I Flew with the Birds</span> (1949), <span class="italic">No Echo in the Sky</span> (1958), <span class="italic">Airymouse</span> (1982), <span class="italic">Cloud Cuckooland</span> (1981), and <span class="italic">Adventure with Fate</span> (1984). Other titles were <span class="italic">Architect of Wings</span> (1985), a biography of Avro designer Roy Chadwick; <span class="italic">Wings across the World</span>, a history of British Airways; and an impressive five-volume history of British aviation. Penrose was made a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1936, and in 1993&#151;when his tally had risen to 5500 hours on 309 types&#151;he was presented with honorary fellowship of the American Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He died at his home, Broad Hill, Hardington Mandeville, Yeovil, on 31 August 1996.<br>
