<span class="headword">Ker,  James  Innes-</span>, fifth duke of Roxburghe  (1736&#150;1823), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born on 10 January 1736 at Innes House, Moray, the second of the three sons of Sir Hary or Henry Innes of Innes, fifth baronet (<i>d</i>. 1762), and his wife, Ann, the daughter of Sir James Grant of Grant, sixth baronet, and the sister of Jean Grant, who married the first Earl Fife. During the rising of 1745 Moray was held by the Jacobites, and to avoid falling into their hands Innes was sent across the Moray Firth to Dunrobin Castle, seat of the earls of Sutherland. He was educated at the University of Leiden.<br>
<br>Like many other noblemen of little fortune, Innes took up a military career. He was appointed captain of the 88th foot (the Highland Volunteers) on 7 November 1759, and of the 58th foot in 1779. His elder brother Henry had died by 1759, and so on his father's death on 31 October 1762 he succeeded as sixth baronet. His family claimed to have held Innes since 1160, and at one time possessed the whole territory between the Spey and the Lossie, besides estates in Banffshire; but for a century their fortunes had been ebbing, and in 1767 Innes was obliged to sell his ancient barony of Innes to his first cousin James Duff, second Earl Fife. He did not remain landless for long. On 19 April 1769 he married&#151;at St James's, Westminster&#151;Mary (1730&#150;1807), the eldest daughter of Sir John Wray, twelfth baronet, of Glentworth, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Frances, the daughter of Fairfax Norcliffe of Langton, Yorkshire. His wife inherited the Langton estate soon afterwards, and on 31 May 1769 Innes assumed by royal licence the additional surname of Norcliffe.<br>
<br>Perhaps following the reforming example of his brother-in-law Sir Cecil Wray, Innes-Norcliffe became a member of the Yorkshire Association, and he was one of the delegates who accompanied the movement's leader, Christopher Wyvill, to the meeting of delegates from county associations supporting parliamentary and economic reform in March and April 1781. He does not seem to have been politically active after this time. On his wife's death, on 20 July 1807, the Langton estate passed to her nephew Thomas Dalton.<br>
<br>Innes-Norcliffe, however, was now pursuing a grander inheritance. On 22 October 1805 William Bellenden Ker, fourth duke of Roxburghe, had died, leaving no surviving children. Innes's paternal great-grandfather, Sir James Innes, third baronet, had married in 1666 Margaret Ker, the third daughter of Harry, Lord Ker (<i>d</i>. 1643), himself son of Robert Ker, first earl of Roxburghe. The first earl had secured a regrant of his titles and estates in 1646, favouring first his grandson William Drummond and his descendants in the male line (the last of whom was the fourth duke), then the three younger sons of his daughter Jane, countess of Wigtown, and their descendants in the male line (provided the eldest surviving of the nominated heirs married the eldest surviving daughter of Harry, Lord Ker), and then the daughters of Harry, Lord Ker, in order of seniority, and their descendants in the male line, failing which, the earldom and estates should pass to the earl's nearest heir in the collateral male line. The dukedom of Roxburghe, created in 1707, had been given the same limitation, and, as the great-grandson of the only daughter of Lord Ker to have surviving descendants in the male line, Innes-Norcliffe claimed to have succeeded to the dukedom and estates. He took the surname Innes-Ker, and on 28 July 1807, eight days after his wife's death, married Harriet (<i>bap</i>. 1777, <i>d</i>. 1855), the daughter of Benjamin Charlewood, of Windlesham, Surrey, and his wife, Mary, who had married as her second husband the engraver Valentine Green. The new Lady Innes-Ker had previously lived &#145;as a sort of companion&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 9.3234) to her husband's daughter.<br>
<br>Innes-Ker's claims were challenged by a number of rivals: Lady Essex Ker, the sister of the third duke; Major-General Walter Ker of Littledean, Roxburghshire, collateral heir male of the first earl; William Drummond of Logiealmond, Perthshire, collateral heir male of the fourth duke; and John Bellenden Ker, in whose favour the fourth duke had entailed the property. It took three days (15, 16, and 20 June 1809) for Lord Chancellor Eldon to state in the House of Lords the grounds on which he preferred Innes-Ker to the other claimants. The litigation continued until 11 May 1812, when the House of Lords finally recognized Innes-Ker as fifth duke of Roxburghe.<br>
<br>Roxburghe thus inherited Floors Castle, near Kelso, Roxburghshire, and the other ducal properties, since the House of Lords overturned the entail settling them on Bellenden Ker. He quickly sold the library of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15452/', "John Ker, third duke")</script>, in order to pay his legal costs. Roxburghe enjoyed his new status by supporting several of his wife's impoverished relatives, some of whom were members of the circle of the diarist Joseph Farington. In 1814 he executed a deed of settlement which placed his estates and property in the hands of trustees, benefiting the heirs of the original entail but protecting the position of his wife and guaranteeing legacies to members of his and his wife's families. At the age of eighty he fathered a son, James Robert Henry (1816&#150;1879), who eventually succeeded him as sixth duke, and the trust deed was amended to provide for his son's minority. Roxburghe died at Floors on 19 July 1823, and was buried in the Ker family vault at Bowden, Roxburghshire. His widow married, at Chelsea on 14 November 1827, Colonel Walter Frederick O'Reilly of the 41st foot. She died on 19 January 1855.<br>
