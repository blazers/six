<span class="headword">Bowen,  Edwin Yorke <span class="st"> [York]</span></span>  (1884&#150;1961), <span class="occ">pianist and composer</span>, was born on 22 February 1884 in Crouch Hill, London, the youngest of the three sons of Edward Bowen (<i>d</i>. 1911), founder of the whisky distillers Bowen and McKechnie, and his wife, Ellen Mary (1854&#150;1906), the daughter of the Revd W. B. Dennis, a Wesleyan minister. He was known as York Bowen from about 1906. He showed musical promise at an early age, and his mother gave him his first piano and harmony lessons. He then attended the North Metropolitan College of Music and, from 1892, the Blackheath Conservatoire of Music, where he studied under Alfred Izard. At the age of eight he performed the solo part in one of Dussek's piano concertos.<br>
<br>When he was fourteen Bowen won the Erard scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied composition under Frederick Corder and piano under Tobias Matthay as well as viola and horn, and he was also a proficient organist, enabling him to write idiomatically for a variety of instruments. In 1902 he composed his first symphony and a symphonic poem, <span class="italic">The Lament of Tasso</span>, which was performed at a Promenade Concert conducted by Henry Wood. Bowen toured Britain, performing his own compositions, including his first piano concerto (December 1903), as well as solos by Chopin, Liszt, Skryabin, and Tchaikovsky. In addition he conducted some of his own orchestral works, which were favourably received. Saint-Sa&euml;ns praised &#145;the most remarkable of the young British composers&#146;  (Potts), and considered Bowen's potential to be greater than that of his fellow student Arnold Bax, who had made his impact as a prodigious pianist but not yet as a composer. In 1905, having won all the prizes for piano and composition, and having been awarded the Worshipful Company of Musicians medal, Bowen left the academy to teach at the Tobias Matthay Pianoforte School. He was elected a fellow of the academy in 1907 and appointed to the staff there in 1909.<br>
<br>On 23 April 1912 Bowen married (Dorothy) Sylvia Beatrice Dalton (1888&#150;1967), the only daughter of the Revd J. P. Dalton, rector of Creech St Michael, Somerset. Sylvia had acted with the Old Vic Company, but following her marriage to Bowen she studied lieder and later gave recitals with her husband. Their son, Philip, was born on 25 March 1913. During the First World War Bowen joined the Scots Guards and played the horn in the regimental band. He went to France, but returned in 1916 with pneumonia.<br>
<br>Bowen's early musical style was influenced by Liszt, Wagner, Richard Strauss, and the Russian nationalists. He was fascinated by the music of Debussy and Ravel, and temporarily resigned from the Royal Academy following a disagreement on this matter with the principal, Alexander Mackenzie. With his friend Benjamin Dale he frequently attended Wagner operas. He began his compositional career when abstract Romantic music was popular and he continued writing in this lyrical style long after the end of the First World War, when it was considered old-fashioned. The war had signalled a turning point for many European composers, including his contemporaries Bax, Ireland, and Bridge, but Bowen disapproved of all modernist trends, vehemently objecting to music which lacked tonality and melody. His rejection of prevailing fashions won him the admiration of the composer and pianist Kaikhosru Sorabji, who compared him with Rakhmaninov and Medtner, and who hired the Bechstein Hall about 1946 in order to hear Bowen perform his twenty-four preludes and fugues, op. 102.<br>
<br>As one would expect from a pianist-composer, piano music on both a small and large scale dominates Bowen's <i>&#339;uvre</i>. His orchestral output includes four symphonies and four piano concertos. Chamber music was frequently performed by his friends, among them Lionel Tertis, Carl Dolmetsch, Leon Goossens, and Aubrey Brain. Bowen composed a number of secular songs for his wife and some piano duets and two-piano pieces, which he performed with Harry Isaacs.<br>
<br>Although he was primarily a performer, Bowen spent much of his life teaching. He wrote pedagogical works for piano students and edited works by Chopin and Mozart. He frequently examined or adjudicated at competitions and festivals and from 1951 he sat on the audition panel for the BBC. In 1959, having reached the age of seventy-five, he retired from the Royal Academy, and in the following year he recorded a selection of his piano pieces for Lyrita. He continued to lead an active life as a composer, recitalist, examiner, and teacher, and he had been preparing for a broadcast when he suffered a fatal coronary thrombosis and died in New End Hospital, Hampstead, on 23 November 1961. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
<br>Monica Watson commemorated Bowen's centenary by writing a biography. While sometimes appearing aloof, he had a sense of humour and was remembered affectionately by friends and pupils. A York Bowen Society was founded by John Lindsay to promote his music and that of other neglected British composers, and Bowen's manuscripts are housed in the Royal Academy of Music.<br>
