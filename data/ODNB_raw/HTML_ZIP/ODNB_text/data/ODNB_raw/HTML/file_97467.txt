</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newby,  (George) Eric</span>  (1919&#150;2006), <span class="occ">travel writer and adventurer</span>, was born at 3 Castelnau Mansions, Barnes, Surrey, on 6 December 1919, the son of George Arthur Newby, a partner in a firm of wholesale dressmakers, and his wife (Minnie) Hilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pomeroy, a former dress model at Harrods. A strain of adventure ran in the family: his father had run away to sea as a boy before settling into his career as a couturier, and Newby himself was influenced at an early age by hearing a lecture at school about Scott's expedition to the south pole and reading about exotic foreign places. He was educated at St Paul's School in London, and left at sixteen&#151;having already established himself as something of a school joker&#151;to join an advertising agency; but after two years (inadvertently following his father's footsteps) he signed on to join a four-masted Finnish barque that was setting out on a 30,000 mile round trip carrying grain between Ireland and Australia. He was later to write an account of this in <span class="italic">The Last Grain Race</span> (1956), in which he described the hazards of climbing masts &#145;as high as Nelson's column&#146;.<br>
<br>With his taste for adventure already awakened, it was not surprising that at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Newby promptly enlisted in the London Scottish regiment, being later sent to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and after a spell in the Middle East being transferred to the Special Boat Section (later to become the Special Boat Service). It was with them that he was sent in 1942 on a commando-type raid against a military airfield in Sicily that was proving a serious menace to allied convoys attempting to supply and reinforce Malta. The operation was ill-prepared, and Newby was landed at night with a party of six men on an unreconnoitred coastline to attack a heavily defended position; almost inevitably the intruders were discovered and forced to retreat to the beach where they had landed. They failed to make the rendezvous with their submarine, were decanted into the water from their fragile canoes, and were eventually picked up by some Italian fishermen who handed them over to the authorities.<br>
<br>Newby then began a series of escapades and escapes. He was initially in a prisoner-of-war camp in Italy (having survived threats of being shot as a saboteur), but when the Italians surrendered in 1943 he was smuggled out of the camp hospital&#151;where he was suffering from a broken ankle&#151;to a more sympathetic hospital run by Italian nuns. It was there that he met Wanda Skof, a Slovene girl, who taught him some Italian, brought him treats in hospital, and encouraged him to escape before the Germans arrived. When writing about these experiences many years later in <span class="italic">Love and War in the Apennines</span> (1972) he compared her to the gaoler's daughter who befriends Toad in <span class="italic">The Wind in the Willows</span> and confessed, &#145;I had begun by thinking her a very good-looking girl &hellip; then I had begun to admire her courage and determination &hellip; now I was in love with her&#146;  (p. 65). She arranged for him to be sheltered by Italian peasants in the Apennines, but he was eventually betrayed and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany. At the end of the war he was awarded a belated Military Cross for his part in the Sicily raid and&#151;more importantly&#151;managed to return to Italy and propose to Wanda. They were married in Florence in 1946 and had two children, Sonia and Jonathan.<br>
<br>Returning to civilian life Newby entered his father's profession and worked in the family business and later with the couture house Worth Pasquin. He appreciated the humorous side of the fashion industry and later recorded this in his book <span class="italic">Something Wholesale</span> (1962). But his heart was not in it, and he dreamed of returning to his wartime days of adventures abroad. He brought these dreams into reality in 1956 when he sent a telegram to his friend the diplomat <a href="#cosubject_104449">Hugh Carless [<i>see below</i>]</a>, enquiring &#145;Can you travel Nuristan June?&#146; The prompt reply&#151;&#145;Of course, Hugh&#146;&#151;resulted in the hilarious and seminal travel book, <span class="italic">A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush</span> (1958), in which he recounted his amateurish exploits, first in a brief attempt to come to terms with mountaineering in Wales and later in attempting serious climbing in northern Afghanistan. Carless is presented as a solemn and responsible foil to Newby's own fecklessness. The book ends with a report of a memorable encounter with the veteran explorer Wilfred Thesiger who, on seeing the intrepid couple inflating mattresses before sleeping on the bare rocks, allegedly declared, &#145;God, you must be a couple of pansies&#146;  (Newby, <span class="italic">A Short Walk</span>, 2008 edn, 248). The book, for which Evelyn Waugh had been persuaded to write an introduction, was an instant success, and following this Newby&#151;after a few years as a fashion buyer for the John Lewis group&#151;changed the course of his life to one of literature and travel.<br>
<br>In 1964 David Astor was expanding the scope of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and Newby was appointed as travel editor. During the decade in which he held this appointment he brought imagination and a high standard of writing in the travel pages, but he had little interest or aptitude for the administrative side of the job, for which he leaned heavily on his colleagues. He deplored the degeneration of independent travel and exploration into tourism and tried to resist this in the columns of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. It was said that without the dedication of his staff to the day-to-day routine of producing this section of the paper the travel pages might sometimes have failed to appear altogether. This was partly because much of Newby's energy and concentration during these years was on planning and carrying out further adventurous travels himself. Many of his trips were made in the company of Wanda, and they resulted in such books as <span class="italic">Slowly Down the Ganges</span> (1966). It was during these years that he wrote of his wartime experiences and also a number of less celebrated titles. None of his later books received nor warranted quite the acclaim of his Hindu Kush and Apennine books.<br>
<br>Newby and his wife had always maintained their affection for Italy, and in 1967 they acquired a derelict farmhouse near Lerici in Liguria, which over the years they restored to a degree of comfort; he wrote about the experience in <span class="italic">A Small Place in Italy</span> (1994). They spent part of the year there and part at their home in Dorset; they subsequently moved to Surrey. He continued writing travel books until well into his eighties, but the quality of his later work (he wrote some twenty-five books in all) inevitably reflected his diminishing energy. He was appointed CBE in 1994 and had long been a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and of the Royal Geographical Society. In his last years Wanda supported him as actively and loyally as she had done during their first encounters in wartime Italy. He died at Birtley House care home, Birtley Road, Bramley, near Guildford, Surrey, on 20 October 2006 following a stroke, and was survived by his wife and their two children.<br>
<br>Eric Newby did for travel writing after the Second World War a service similar to that which Peter Fleming had performed for the genre between the wars. He brought a genuinely daring spirit of adventure to his travels, but he wrote about them in a light-hearted and self-deprecating way&#151;often including passages of riotous joking. His sense of fun infected his readers. In this way he inspired younger travellers to seek out remote corners of the world on their long vacations and gap years, in the same way as his near-contemporary&#151;and fellow war hero&#151;Patrick Leigh Fermor inspired them to explore the remoter corners of Europe. His distinctive mixture of courage in the face of danger, irreverence in the face of authority, and good humour in the face of discomfort and adversity, appealed to a whole generation as being quintessentially British.<br>
<br>Newby's travelling companion in Nuristan, <a name="cosubject_104449"></a><span class="headword">Hugh Michael Carless</span>  (1925&#150;2011), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 22 April 1925 in Naini Tal, India, the elder son of Henry Alfred Carless (1894&#150;1976), Indian civil servant, and his wife, Gwendolen Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pattullo (1900&#150;1989). He was educated at Sherborne School, and briefly at the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, where he studied Farsi with Vladimir Minorsky before being commissioned in the intelligence corps in 1943 and being posted to Tehran. Towards the end of the Second World War he transferred to north-west Europe and served with the army in Germany, remaining there during the early years of peace. Demobilized in 1947, he went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he read history, graduating in 1950. He joined the foreign service later the same year, and in 1951 was posted to Kabul as third secretary. While there he undertook his first forays into the remoter parts of the country. In 1953 he was transferred as second secretary to Rio de Janeiro, where he met Rosa Maria Frontini (1921&#150;2013), artist and journalist, daughter of Martino Frontini, banker, of S&atilde;o Paulo. They married in 1957 in Tehran (where Carless had been transferred) and had two sons.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in 1956, before taking up his post in Tehran, Carless undertook the expedition to Nuristan with his friend Newby, whom he had met through their mutual friend Paul Rolo. He returned to London in 1958, and was private secretary to the minister of state, Lord Dundee, for two years from 1961. His subsequent postings included Budapest (1963&#150;6), Luanda (1967&#150;70) as consul-general, Bonn (1970&#150;73) as counsellor, London (1973&#150;7) as head of the Latin America department (where he supported Anthony Crosland in his policy of seeking functional co-operation with Argentina in the Falklands, in order to reduce tensions over sovereignty), Buenos Aires (1977&#150;80) as minister and charg&eacute; d'affaires (from where he warned of the increasingly belligerent attitude of the military junta), and, after a spell seconded to industry, Caracas, where he was ambassador to Venezuela (1982&#150;5) at a time when anti-British feeling was running high. He was appointed CMG in 1976. After retiring from the diplomatic service he was executive vice-president of the Hinduja Foundation (1986&#150;97) and vice-chairman of the South Atlantic Council (1987&#150;97). From 1994 to 1996 he was chairman of the British committee of the Argentine-British Conferences, which laid the groundwork for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries following the Falklands conflict. He was admired by Newby for his determination, unflappability, and sense of humour, and by others for his wide learning and charming modesty. Throughout his career he was much helped by his vivacious and talented wife. They lived latterly in Bryanston Square, London, and he died on 20 December 2011. He was survived by his wife and one son, Ronnie, the other, Roger, having predeceased him.<br>
