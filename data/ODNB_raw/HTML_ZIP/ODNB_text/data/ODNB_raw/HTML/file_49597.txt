<span class="headword">Burton,  (Frances) Elaine</span>, Baroness Burton of Coventry  (1904&#150;1991), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 2 March 1904 at 17 Royal Avenue, Scarborough, Yorkshire, the only child of Lesley Aubrey Burton and his wife, Frances Butler. She remembered her father as an upper-class wastrel who squandered his inheritance, yet he was also a hurdler in the 1908 Olympics and gave her a lifelong enthusiasm for sports. He paid local boys a penny each to race her, and in 1919 she won the 100 yards sprint at the Northern Counties Ladies' Championships in Manchester. After attending Leeds Girls' Modern School she trained as a teacher at Leeds City Training College and taught in primary schools and evening classes in Leeds from 1924 to 1935, coached city sports teams, and played county hockey and cricket. However, she realized that she was a political animal, if not necessarily a good party person, and amid the economic insecurity of the 1930s she abandoned her career to study unemployment first hand. She spent two years (1935&#150;7) as a social worker in south Wales before becoming an organizer of keep fit classes for the National Fitness Council.<br>
<br>Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Burton was laid off and spent over six months seeking work. Reluctant to teach again, she presented an article about women's unemployment to a newspaper editor and her initiative resulted in a weekly column in <span class="italic">The Star</span> on women's wartime difficulties; these articles were published in 1941 as <span class="italic">What of the Women?</span>. This was followed in 1942 with <span class="italic">And your Verdict?</span>, which accused the government of denying women their full role in the war effort. She also worked for the John Lewis Partnership. Her interest in politics blossomed and in June 1943 she stood as a Common Wealth candidate in the Hartlepool parliamentary by-election, where she was soundly defeated by the Labour candidate. After Labour rejected an alliance with the young left-wing movement in 1944 many Common Wealth members, including Elaine Burton, switched parties to ensure a united front against the Conservatives. While the Labour landslide and the magnanimous endorsement of Common Wealth's leading light, J. B. Priestley, did not help her win Hendon South in 1945, she defeated the former Conservative minister Leslie Hore-Belisha five years later in Coventry South.<br>
<br>As a late convert to Labour, Burton aroused some suspicion among her new colleagues, though one sceptic&#151;Jean Mann&#151;was soon impressed by her doughty advocacy of women's issues in the face of an indifferent party leadership. An ardent but not aggressive feminist, Burton urged equal pay and had a talent for rapidly asking ministers follow-up questions before the speaker could move on. Though she personally hated housework and cooking she became the housewives' voice in parliament, making her an authority on consumer protection. In 1955 she delivered a political broadcast on value for money. She also successfully sponsored a <span class="roman">Disposal of Uncollected Goods Bill</span>, enabling shopkeepers to sell abandoned goods left for cleaning or repair. For example, she told MPs, there were 450,000 uncollected pairs of shoes at cobblers' shops in the country and this bill would help such tradesmen to recoup some of the resulting costs.<br>
<br>Burton championed Coventry's needs, particularly its employment problems. None the less her local party threatened to deselect her in 1955 after she defied their instructions and voted to deny Aneurin Bevan the party whip over his perceived challenge to Clement Attlee's leadership. The controversy soon subsided, and at that year's general election Coventry's anti-Labour swing was smallest in her constituency, perhaps because voters respected her independent stand, but in 1959 she was defeated and felt &#145;gutted&#146; at losing her platform in parliament. For two years she worked as an adviser at John Waddington Ltd, which had produced a card game invented by her, based on the coronation. She returned to parliament on her creation as Baroness Burton of Coventry in April 1962. For years her trademark had been her large and colourful veiled hats, known as the &#145;bride's mother's hat&#146;&#151;she had even worn them on the dole queue&#151;but in the upper house she ran into a seventeenth-century rule forbidding headwear. In 1965 she persuaded the house to abolish the rule and enlivened the chamber with her millinery as she had done in the Commons.<br>
<br>Burton made many more substantial contributions to the Lords' work, including the continuation of a crusade she had begun as an MP. Remembering her own experience of buying clothes horses in order to practise hurdling, abandoning her dream of swimming the channel, and seeing athletically talented students unable to fulfil their potential owing to lack of resources, she argued vigorously for improved funding of amateur athletics (though she was staunchly opposed to tobacco sponsorship). She warned that a ministry of sport would be meddlesome, but as early as 1956, in one of her numerous letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, she urged the creation of an independent grant supported body like the Arts Council. After she had raised questions and initiated debates on the issue the government agreed to subsidize amateur athletes who wished to compete internationally. In 1965 she was appointed to the newly formed Sports Council, which served only to advise the government but in 1971, the year she retired, it was given independence and responsibility for allocating funds.<br>
<br>Baroness Burton also spoke on such favourite topics as women's opportunities in business and public life, initiating a debate on the matter at the age of eighty (she had been a founding member of the Federation of Business and Professional Women). She championed the rights of air travellers, campaigned to protect children from flammable nightwear, and took an interest in broadcasting, having served on the Independent Television Authority between 1964 and 1969. Throughout the 1970s she worried about the Labour Party's direction and urged fellow moderates to actively resist the encroachment of the far left. Feeling that her pleas were in vain she and eight other peers left the party in January 1981, declaring her inability to accept such policies as unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the EEC, and the party's proposed new method of choosing its leader. She became the Social Democratic Party's spokesman in the Lords on civil aviation and consumer affairs, and remained active until she died, unmarried, on 6 October 1991 at her home, 18 Vincent Court, Seymour Place, Westminster.<br>
