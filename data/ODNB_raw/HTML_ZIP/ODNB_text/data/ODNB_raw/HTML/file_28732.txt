<span class="headword">Warenne,  Hamelin  de</span>, earl of Surrey <span class="st"> [Earl Warenne]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1202), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the natural son of Geoffrey, count of Anjou (<i>d</i>. 1151), and half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12949/', "Henry II")</script>, from whom he received the Warenne Anglo-Norman honours with the title earl of Surrey in April 1164 on his marriage to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28733/', "Isabel de Warenne, countess of Surrey (d. 1203)")</script>, widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46707/', "William of Blois, Earl Warenne (d. 1159)")</script>. Although Hamelin readily adopted the Warenne family name, he proudly acknowledged in his charters both his Angevin paternal heritage and his debt to his royal brother. Hamelin's first reported political act, a vociferous denunciation of Thomas Becket at the Council of Northampton in October 1164, was motivated by the archbishop's perceived injury to the royal family in blocking the marriage of William FitzEmpress to the Countess Isabel on grounds of consanguinity. William had died shortly thereafter while seeking the intervention of his mother, the Empress Matilda, in the matter. Many of his friends believed that the disappointment had helped to cause his death. Few at court could have missed the connection, psychological or otherwise, of Hamelin's good fortune in gaining his title and high-born wife with the equally great misfortune of the death of the king's (and Hamelin's) younger brother. It is within this context that Hamelin's early confrontational attitude towards Thomas Becket is best explained. Years later the earl became, as did Henry II himself, an active participant in the then sainted archbishop's cult, having been healed, miraculously it was thought, of a cataract in one eye by the covering which lay on Becket's tomb.<br>
<br>In England in 1166, and again in Normandy in 1172, Hamelin was one of a handful of &eacute;lite Anglo-Norman courtiers who were not obligated to report their knights' fees and their royal or ducal knight service. Consequently the Warenne fiefs are missing from the great surveys of Henry II's reign: the <span class="italic">Cartae baronum</span> and the <span class="italic">Infeudationes militum</span>. None the less, other near-contemporary sources indicate something of the magnitude and importance of the Warenne honours. The <span class="roman">Domesday</span> evaluation of the family's lands in England amounted to some &pound;1140, which placed them among the four or five wealthiest secular holdings below the king. By the second half of the twelfth century over 140 knights' fees had been subinfeudated by the Warennes, making Hamelin in 1173 the ninth greatest lord in England as reckoned by enfeoffments. What his ranking may have been in Normandy is difficult to say, except that his wife's ancestral lands, centred on the strategic castles of Mortemer and Bellencombre, would have made the earl a major force in Upper Normandy. Indeed castles are as good a measure as any other of power, prestige, and wealth. On the English side of the channel Hamelin inherited castles at Lewes, Castle Acre, Reigate, and Sandal. For his part he built (<i>c</i>.1180) the magnificent keep at Conisbrough, which was later to serve as an inspiration for Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>.<br>
<br>Hamelin was well connected politically outside the royal family. His brother-in-law, Reginald de Warenne, worked frequently as a baron of the English exchequer. Hugh de Cressy, a Warenne under-tenant and sometime seneschal, rose to become Henry II's constable for Rouen and constant companion. Like so many of his peers Hamelin enjoyed prestige and wealth without much interference from royal government. According to the English pipe rolls the earl was assessed a total of &pound;276 over a period of thirty-eight years, against which he paid the sum of &pound;74, mostly on scutages taken from his under-tenants. It would be wrong to conclude from this, however, that Hamelin lived the pampered life of a detached aristocrat. His wealth and connections did obligate him to an active participation in state affairs, an obligation he took seriously. Throughout his tenure as earl, Hamelin remained steadfastly loyal to his brother the king, to his nephew Richard I, and, when challenged, to Angevin royal interests.<br>
<br>Judging from the relatively low number of royal charters attested by Hamelin (ten), the earl apparently never entered the intimate, inner circle at Henry II's court, as did other family members like Reginald, earl of Cornwall. And yet, at critical moments in the reign, he is found at his brother's side. When Henry met Raymond de St Gilles, count of Toulouse, in February 1173 at Fontevrault to settle long-standing differences, Hamelin was there attesting charters as &#145;vicomte of the Touraine&#146;. That Henry chose the earl to act as vicomte in this sensitive border region between the houses of Anjou and Blois displays great trust. Perhaps Hamelin took up this office during the king's stay in Ireland (1171&#150;2), when the hostility of the French court, particularly the Blois family, was directed against the Angevin monarchy for Henry's perceived complicity in the murder of Thomas Becket. If so, Hamelin acted as one of the chief protectors of his brother's dominions during the time of Henry's self-imposed Irish exile. Equally important, the political manoeuvrings of February 1173 saw the king negotiating a marriage for John to the daughter of the count of Maurienne and fending off the demand of Henry, the Young King, to be put in control of some part of his inheritance. Henry's announced intention of the conveyance of the Tourangeaux castles of Chinon and Loudun to the five-year-old John as a marriage portion precipitated the premature launching by Henry, the Young King, of the rebellion he had been planning against his father. Lost in subsequent events is the fact that Hamelin would have been the local overseer of John's properties had the original plan been carried out. Hamelin held fast with his brother against his nephews and their French and Scottish allies in the ensuing civil war and next appears in the chronicles in 1176 as a member of Joan's escort through central and southern France as his niece, the princess, journeyed to Sicily for her marriage with King William. In the 1180s Hamelin focused much of his energy on his estates in Yorkshire, building the wondrous castle and keep at Conisbrough. He undoubtedly spent more time in Yorkshire than any of the other Warenne earls and may have been attracted to the region as much by the opportunity to leave his own fresh mark in a family of prodigious builders as by the thriving northern economy. Years of experience at the Angevin court, coupled with private success in the management of the diverse Warenne properties, earned Hamelin a respect which would serve him well in the troubled years following Henry II's death in 1189.<br>
<br>Although Hamelin played no ceremonial role in Richard I's first coronation, as did other earls, he travelled widely with the new king, attesting thirteen charters, at Geddington (three), Bury St Edmunds (three), Canterbury (three), Rouen (three), and Montrichard (one), all before July 1190, when the main Angevin armies departed on crusade. With Richard gone Hamelin quickly attached himself to the king's chancellor, William de Longchamp, bishop of Ely. Their friendship was born of necessity: Longchamp was attempting to whittle down the power in the north of Hugh du Puiset, bishop of Durham, while fending off the intrigues of the king's brother, Count John; and Hamelin was equally disturbed by Hugh and John, holding true to the monarchy and his nephew, the king, as he had to his brother. Hamelin felt most comfortable adhering to the law (the legend on his seal reads &#145;pro lege, per lege&#146;) and, with Richard gone, William de Longchamp represented the law. When Geoffrey, archbishop of York (yet another nephew), was taken into custody at Dover in September 1191, when he attempted to enter England contrary to royal order, it was Earl Hamelin who was dispatched by the chancellor to bring the archbishop to London to face judgment by the &#145;barons of the realm&#146;. When the outrage over the archbishop's treatment, combined with a growing sense of Longchamp's unrestrained ambition, allowed Count John to galvanize baronial discontent for a showdown with the chancellor at Loddon Bridge near Windsor in October, Hamelin again was conspicuous in his support of Longchamp. And after the chancellor's exile, when news of Richard's captivity in Germany reached England, Hamelin acted as one of only two magnates (William d'Aubigny, earl of Arundel, being the other) who were entrusted with the collection and safe keeping of the king's ransom. After Richard's return in 1194 the earl took a place of honour at a second coronation, carrying one of the three swords of state with William, king of Scots, and Ranulf (III), earl of Chester. A northern orientation again is apparent in these pairings. At the Council of Nottingham that same year Hamelin sat with Richard as sentences were handed out to John's followers and other disturbers of the king's peace. With this, Hamelin's long involvement in national politics slowed to an end. Present at John's coronation in May 1199, the earl attested no royal charters from the reign, though he is reported by Roger of Howden to have witnessed an oath given by William, king of Scots in November 1200.<br>
<br>Absorbed by private matters, most notably a dispute with Cluny over the right to appoint the prior of Lewes, Earl Hamelin died on 7 May 1202 and was buried in the chapter house at St Pancras Priory, Lewes, Sussex. The Countess Isabel died shortly thereafter and was interred with her husband. The earl and countess were survived by four children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28739/', "William (IV) de Warenne")</script>, who succeeded to the earldom; Isabel, who married first Robert de Lacy of Pontefract and second Gilbert de l'Aigle of Pevensey; Maud, who married first Henry, count of Eu, and second Henry de Stuteville, lord of Valmont in Normandy; and Ela, who married first Robert of Naburn and second William fitz William of Sprotborough. If many of the personal details of Earl Hamelin's life are unknown, something of his mind comes through in these words taken from a grant to Lewes: &#145;grounds for forgetfulness and dispute are wont to be removed by the good effect of a written deed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cartulary of the Priory of St Pancras of Lewes</span>, 1932&#150;3, 38.45). In his heart, then, the earl was both lawyer and historian.<br>
