<span class="headword">Tongue,  Richard</span>  (1795&#150;1873), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born in Bath, Somerset, on 20 February 1795, the son of Richard Tongue (<i>d</i>. 1823/4) and his wife, Ann. His father, a currier and leatherseller with a house and business in Peter Street, Bath, left a half share in the business to Richard, who remained associated with the family firm of Tongue and Co. until 1839, when the premises were sold and he moved with his two unmarried sisters to Bathwick Hill, Bath.<br>
<br>Tongue was a self-taught amateur artist who described himself as a landscape painter. Although he said he had been painting oils at least from 1818, the few known surviving paintings attributed to him date from the years from 1833 to 1837. He appeared to have no wish to sell his work, only to donate it to institutions where it could be seen. His main interests were prehistoric monuments, or &#145;Celtic antiquities&#146; as they were described at the time, and precariously balanced rocks said to have druidic associations.<br>
<br>Tongue's earliest known works were models: in 1822 he modelled a terracotta bust of Plato, which was given to the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution in 1839. In 1826 he donated five models of &#145;druidical remains&#146; in Cornwall and Devon to the institution and as a result was appointed curator of models, an honorary position he held until 1845. In 1832 versions of four of the same models were given to the Bristol Institution. In 1834 he gave the British Museum four plaster models of prehistoric monuments in Cornwall made in 1826 and 1828 and two of sites in Wales made in 1832, all on a scale of one inch to a foot. A later curator of the Bath Institution, C. W. Dymond, noted in his manuscript catalogue of antiquities (<i>c</i>.1894) that &#145;all these are very inaccurate and quite worthless for scientific purposes&#146;. They were also easily damaged as they were made of unbaked clay and only those donated to the British Museum now survive.<br>
<br>Tongue was encouraged by the British Museum's acceptance of his models &#145;to pursue the subject of Celtic Antiquities with additional interest&#146; as he noted in a letter to the museum (10 July 1837). He had already painted <span class="italic">Sheep Grazing, Stonehenge</span> and <span class="italic">Rocking Stone on a Coastal Cliff</span> (Logan Stone, Cornwall) and presented them to the Bath Institution in 1833 (now in the Victoria Art Gallery, Bath). In 1835 he gave another pair of the same size as these (about 20 &times; 28 in.) to the Society of Antiquaries of London, possibly arranged through Joseph Hunter, who was a member of the committee of the Bath Institution from 1825 to 1833 and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries; Tongue stayed with him when in London. Although depicting two quite different views, <span class="italic">Cromlech near Newport</span> (Pentre Ifan, Pembrokeshire) and <span class="italic">Tolmen at Constantine</span> (Cornwall), they are clearly intended to be hung together. Most of these subjects are described and illustrated in Godfrey Higgins's <span class="italic">The Celtic Druids</span> (1829). In 1835 he also gave an etching of a view in Loch Tay, Perthshire, to the British Museum, the only example of his work in this genre known. The same year he copied in oils an illustration from the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span> showing the ascent of the Pieter Both mountain in Mauritius in 1832, with its remarkable balanced rock at the summit. The painting remained in the family of his executor until about 1970, and is now in a private collection.<br>
<br>In the 1830s Tongue went on annual tours to sketch scenery and antiquities and later worked his drawings up into finished oil paintings. His largest work, <span class="italic">Stonehenge from the W. S. W.</span> (60 &times; 83 in.), belonging to the British Museum, is a scaled up version of <span class="italic">Sheep Grazing, Stonehenge</span>. This was given to the trustees in 1837 with a large version of <span class="italic">Tolmen at Constantine</span> and another large painting, <span class="italic">Double Cromlech, Plas Newydd</span> (Anglesey). They had taken him two years to complete and were intended to be displayed in a sequence showing light changing from morning to evening above the models, but he found it necessary to write frequently to the museum between 1837 and 1844 to complain about the delays in exhibiting them and the poor conditions in which they had been placed, and to explain the correct way in which they should be hung. <span class="italic">Tolmen</span> deteriorated so badly that it was returned to him for restoration in 1844. At the same time he was greatly honoured that the museum had shown an interest in his models and paintings. At a time when history painting was growing in popularity he regarded his works as important recordings of ancient monuments peculiar to Britain, but whose remote locations made them inaccessible to the curious. He believed his views could be used for reference by historical artists and antiquaries and would also show that the monuments were worthy of preservation. He was one of the few artists at the time to focus on the prehistoric past and to attempt to depict the monuments in large-scale oil paintings for the public to view. However, despite his aim of faithful recording, Tongue gave his rocks and stones a somewhat woolly and twisted appearance, exaggerating the proportions, changing the backgrounds, and adding romantic overtones. The effect of his na&iuml;ve style is striking and paintings by him have aroused widely different views, from the art historian's &#145;decidedly mediocre&#146;  (Hawes) to the archaeologists' &#145;brilliant&#146;  (Hawkes, <span class="italic">Guide</span>) and &#145;verged on greatness&#146;  (Evans).<br>
<br>Sometime around 1844 Tongue's mental health deteriorated to the extent that he was admitted into the Bailbrook Asylum, Batheaston, Somerset, and then to a succession of lunatic asylums in Wiltshire as a private patient until shortly before his death. In 1845 he was admitted to Fiddington House, Market Lavington; by 1851 he was in Northfield House, Calne, and from 1854 to 1873 he resided in Kingsdown House, Box. He died intestate at 2 Pierrepoint Place, Bath, Somerset, on 8 December 1873, two weeks after his last surviving sister. He never married and his nephew, William Titley, was granted letters of administration.<br>
<br>The brief appearance of Tongue's models and paintings in the British Museum for a few years from 1838 was reported with considerable approval in the contemporary press. After they were removed from public display his work was largely forgotten until Jacquetta Hawkes drew attention to his painting <span class="italic">Cromlech near Newport</span> in her <span class="italic">Early Britain</span> (1945) and John Piper reproduced his <span class="italic">Stonehenge</span> in 1949. Since then interest in him has grown, especially with the display of three of his paintings in the Society of Antiquaries of London's exhibition &#145;Making History&#146; at the Royal Academy in 2007.<br>
