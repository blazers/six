<span class="headword">Dickenson,  William</span>  (1584/5&#150;1642/3), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was the son of Thomas Dickenson, cook at Eton College. He was educated at the college, then matriculated on 15 April 1603, aged eighteen, from St Alban Hall, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1606. He moved to Merton and proceeded MA in 1612 and BD in 1619, having become chaplain to the earl of Pembroke, chancellor of the university. That year he preached at the midsummer assizes at Reading. The sermon was a highly political one on the nature of royal authority, perhaps prompted by the recent death of Bishop Overall, whose extreme views on divine right it espoused. In transparent allusions to current political debate Dickenson managed to compliment personalities&#151;notably Bacon&#151;at that time in royal favour, while attacking others&#151;the Howards, Coke&#151;who were in disgrace. Its publication, as <span class="italic">The King's Right</span> (1619), followed rapidly: the impression is that this was part of a positioning exercise on behalf of his patron.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards, and perhaps as a reward, Dickenson was presented to the two contiguous and lucrative parishes of Appleton and Besselsleigh, close to Oxford on the Berkshire side of the Thames. There was another claimant to Appleton, Thomas Drope, chaplain of Magdalen College and well known locally. The archbishop's court ruled in Dickenson's favour, but he was never accepted by his parishioners. One reason may have been that it was 1625 before he received from the moderately Calvinistic Bishop Davenant his licence to preach. In an explicit effort to influence his parishioners individually he dedicated to them a catechism, <span class="italic">Milk for Babes</span> (1628). The work was decidedly Arminian in tone and its impact seems to have been disappointing, for he took over the small local manor of Tinteyn and began to concentrate on farming. In or before 1624 Dickenson had married Marie, daughter of Edmund Culpeper, probably a Berkshire clergyman; they had four sons and two daughters, the eldest of whom was Edmund (<i>bap</i>. February 1625).<br>
<br>In 1642 Dickenson, like all adult males, was expected to sign the protestation, a parliamentary loyalty oath. His answer was evasive, showing that he maintained his earlier royalist opinions. The manors of Appleton and Besselsleigh had been acquired during the 1630s by William Lenthall, now speaker of the Commons. As the civil war began with campaigning in the midlands, it became clear that the Thames-side parishes around Oxford would be vulnerable to a royalist advance and Dickenson may have seemed a threat. In October 1642, representatives from both his parishes were received at the bar of the House of Commons with a petition against him; he was declared a delinquent and deprived. The serjeant-at-arms was directed to take him into custody, but there is no evidence that he did so. Dickenson had ceased to keep his parish registers in April 1641 and was unwell when he made his will on 7 November. He was dead by the time James Marten replaced him as rector of Besselsleigh in 1643. His will, which was proved on 28 September 1650, left property both in Appleton and around Marlow. His eldest son, Edmund, became a fashionable physician after the Restoration; Marie Dickenson continued farming at Tinteyn until her death in 1685.<br>
