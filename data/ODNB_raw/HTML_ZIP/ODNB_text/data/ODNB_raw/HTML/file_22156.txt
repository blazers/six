<span class="headword">Phillips,  Henry</span>  (1801&#150;1876), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born at Bristol on 13 August 1801, the son of Richard Phillips, an actor, and his wife (previously a Miss Barnett), a singer and actress. At the age of eight he appeared as a boy soprano at Harrogate Theatre and soon afterwards at the Haymarket and Drury Lane theatres in London. He became a pupil of Broadhurst, and developed a light baritone voice, though he also sang bass roles. His initial engagement at Covent Garden Theatre was a failure. He next studied with Sir George Smart (1823), and was engaged to sing in Arne's <span class="italic">Artaxerxes</span>&#151;but again he made a very poor impression. In 1824, however, he sang Caspar in a version of Weber's <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> at the English Opera House with great success, and thenceforth rose rapidly in public estimation. He soon took a leading place at the provincial musical festivals and was much engaged for theatre and concert work.<br>
<br>In 1825 Phillips became principal bass at the Ancient Concerts and joined the choir of the Bavarian Chapel. In 1834 and 1835 he sang in the premi&egrave;res of Edward Loder's <span class="italic">Nourjahad</span>, John Barnett's <span class="italic">The Mountain Sylph</span>, and Michael Balfe's <span class="italic">The Siege of Rochelle</span>, important in the development of English Romantic opera. Following differences with managements, in 1843 he turned from theatre work to giving music lectures, which he continued at intervals to the end of his career. In 1844 he visited America.<br>
<br>After returning to Britain, in 1845 Phillips sang in Vincent Wallace's <span class="italic">Maritana</span> and in 1846 and 1847 in Mendelssohn's <span class="italic">Elijah</span> under the composer's direction. In 1846 Mendelssohn composed the Ossianic scena <span class="italic">On Lena's Gloomy Heath</span> for him, but it gained neither's full satisfaction. In 1848&#150;9 Phillips's voice declined drastically. He made various attempts in the 1850s to establish himself on a smaller scale, but frequently failed. These included performances with his elder daughter, Florence, a singer. His younger daughter, Alice, was also a singer. Nothing further is known of his family life. After his farewell concert in 1863 he taught in London and Birmingham. He died at his home, 192 Dalston Lane, Dalston, London, on 8 November 1876, and was buried at Brookwood cemetery, Woking.<br>
<br>Phillips's career illustrates that of the major nineteenth-century English professional singer. Never engaged by a prestigious Italian opera company, he depended on seasonal tours incorporating operatic, oratorio, and concert work, and was especially reliant on ballads for maintaining his position and income. His own songs are generally weak. Although he was dominant in his prime, in broader terms he was not of outstanding calibre, and he lost his place and repute with a speed that, initially, surprised him. His <span class="italic">Musical and Personal Recollections during Half a Century</span> (2 vols., 1864, including a portrait) contains much interesting matter. He also wrote <span class="italic">Hints on Declamation</span> (1848) and <span class="italic">The True Enjoyment of Angling</span> (1843).<br>
