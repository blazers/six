</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Liversidge,  Archibald</span>  (1846&#150;1927), <span class="occ">chemist and promoter of science in Australia</span>, was born on 17 November 1846, at Turnham Green, Middlesex, the fourth son and eighth of nine children of John Liversidge (1810&#150;1887), wheelwright and coachbuilder, and his wife, Caroline Sophia Jarratt (1813&#150;1865), of Sussex. Ever moving to be near the highway traffic of London, the family finally settled in Hackney, where the elder brothers prospered in small business, light engineering, and commerce. As the youngest son, and thus freed from the family business, Liversidge was privately educated. He soon acquired the contemporary fascination for natural history. In the tradition of the Microscopical and Natural History Society of Hackney, &#145;habitual observation&#146; became his motto. An enquiring mind led him from classes at the Anglican-inspired City of London College in Leadenhall Street (a precursor of the City University) to the popular lectures of the Royal Polytechnic Institution. In 1867 he won a royal exhibition to the Royal School of Mines (RSM) and Royal College of Chemistry; his teachers there included Edward Frankland, T. H. Huxley, and Warrington Smyth.<br>
<br>In 1868 Liversidge became an assistant in Frankland's laboratory, where he learned analytical methods, taught chemistry at the Royal School of Naval Architecture and published his first scientific note  (<span class="italic">Chemical News</span>, 17, 1868, 49). Encouraged by the example of Frankland and Smyth, he showed equal proficiency in microscopy, spectroscopy, mineralogy, and mineral analysis. In 1870, with several analytical papers to his credit, he was awarded the associateship of the RSM; he was also among the first to win a Bunting exhibition (of &pound;50) created by Christ's College, Cambridge, for men reading for the natural sciences tripos.<br>
<br>Liversidge matriculated at Christ's in 1870 and was soon enlisted as a temporary demonstrator in chemistry. He started the Cambridge University Natural Sciences Club, and published papers in physiological biochemistry. His interests remained eclectic. In 1873, during his third undergraduate year but before he could take the tripos, he was appointed as reader in geology and assistant in the chemical laboratory at the University of Sydney&#151;a preferment secured by the patronage of the RSM.<br>
<br>At Sydney, Liversidge was one of only four teaching staff. He had an ill-equipped laboratory and museum that occupied two rooms in a splendid neo-Gothic building, on a hill overlooking the commercial city, where fifteen students toiled for a BA degree that included experimental science. His challenge was to create a scientific metropolis at the periphery. Within a year he issued a manifesto calling for a school of science, and welcomed the introduction of secondary science as a university matriculation subject. In 1874 he became professor of geology and mineralogy; in 1882 geology was separated, and he became professor of mineralogy and chemistry. From the university, his influence radiated in all directions.<br>
<br>In addition to teaching undergraduates, Liversidge was a &#145;public scientist&#146;, a participant in the transit of Venus observations, a leading analyst of water supply and fossil remains, a consultant to the mines department, and a trustee of the Australian Museum. He was also joint honorary secretary of the Royal Society of New South Wales, which he virtually re-established, and served three times as its president (in 1886, 1890, and 1901); he edited its <span class="italic">Journal and Proceedings</span> from 1874 to 1885. In 1878 he helped represent New South Wales at the Paris Universal Exhibition, and produced a report on European museums and technical schools that guided colonial policy for the next fifty years. The following year he was a guiding force behind the international exhibition (the &#145;Garden Palace&#146;) in Sydney. The same year Sydney University followed London in creating a faculty of science, and Liversidge was its first (and almost perpetual) dean between 1880 and 1907. From the late 1870s he helped establish science at the new University of Adelaide, and frequently exercised his patronage in the appointment of chemists to government departments and museums in New South Wales. In the mid-1880s, as the colony approached the centenary of European settlement, he turned to the improvement of intercolonial scientific co-operation. Building upon visits to New Zealand, and professional friendships with Victorians, Queenslanders, and South Australians, he launched at Sydney in 1888 the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (later ANZAAS). He was its honorary secretary until 1907, and president at its second Sydney congress in 1898.<br>
<br>A bachelor, Liversidge lived for his friends and his work. He was a member of five clubs in London and Sydney and, until he moved to a generous house with sweeping gardens on salubrious Darling Point, a resident of the Union Club. By 1921, he had published over 120 scientific papers, and 22 colonial government reports, plus 16 other notes and articles. He was best known overseas for his studies of the geochemistry of gold, and was among the first to detect rare minerals in meteorites. In 1894 he helped establish the School of Mines at Sydney University. A devoted empirical analyst, he personified the &#145;inventory sciences&#146; and refrained from speculation on contemporary theories of the earth. He published a chemical &#145;audit&#146;, <span class="italic">The Minerals of New South Wales</span> (1876), which was enlarged in 1882 and 1888.<br>
<br>Liversidge attracted few research students, but did count Douglas Mawson (1882&#150;1968) among them. He belonged to twenty-six learned societies in Britain, Australasia, and the United States, but considered his election to the Royal Society in 1882 as the most important honour of his life. An avid collector of minerals and artefacts, Liversidge exhibited at several intercolonial and international exhibitions. He presented specimens of Australian minerals to a number of museums in the northern hemisphere; his own crystal collection went to the Australian Museum.<br>
<br>Liversidge promoted degrees for women, and compulsory European languages, in lieu of the classics, for all undergraduates. Among his achievements was the appointment of T. W. Edgeworth David to Sydney's chair of geology in 1891. A dedicated empire man, Liversidge repeatedly sought ways to bring the ethos of South Kensington to Sydney. As a member of the board of technical education and trustee of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (later the Powerhouse Museum), he advocated technical training, the metric system, and the industrial application of science, along lines he had seen argued in England. Thus he encouraged Sydney pupils to take the City and Guilds examinations, and founded in Sydney a section of the (UK) Society of Chemical Industry. He also helped form the New South Wales branch of the British Science Guild in 1907. In 1896, on the occasion of Kelvin's jubilee, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary LLD. Liversidge also contributed to colonial nationalism&#151;he promoted the idea of an Australasian equivalent of <span class="italic">Nature</span> and an Australian Academy of Science half a century before either was realized.<br>
<br>Liversidge retired, exhausted, from Sydney in 1907. He returned to England to live in some state at Fieldhead, Kingston Hill, Surrey, where he kept three domestic staff, and entertained visiting colleagues, nephews, and nieces. For the next twenty years he enjoyed a second career as a visiting researcher in the Davy&#150;Faraday Laboratory of the Royal Institution. Liversidge never returned to Australia, despite advocating the first (and only) Australian visit of the British Association in 1914, but between 1910 and 1917, as vice-president of the Chemical Society, and as a member of the overseas branch committee of the Institute of Chemistry, he was active in promoting the cause of colonial scientists. During the First World War his advice was sought by the Admiralty on magnesium alloys used in German airships. For the British Science Guild he drafted recommendations for post-war government funding of science in the British universities. Peace brought a renewal of his private research at the Royal Institution where, as a mineralogist and crystallographer, he shared in the general fascination with the new technology of X-ray diffraction. He died, unmarried, of a heart attack, in his sleep, at home in Kingston on 26 September 1927, and was buried the following day at Putney Vale cemetery.<br>
<br>Internationally known by entries in ten biographical directories, Liversidge received twenty-one obituary notices and several retrospective tributes. His will specified legacies of &pound;500 to the Chemical Society, the Royal Society of New South Wales, and the AAAS, and to the chemistry department of the University of Sydney; and &pound;500 to Christ's College, Cambridge, for a &#145;Lecturer alternately in chemistry and on the English language&#146; with special reference to &#145;possible improvements in its grammar and spelling&#146;. A portrait, by John Collier RA, was completed after Liversidge returned to England, and hangs in the Great Hall of Sydney University. Striking a pose similar to that of T. H. Huxley in Collier's famous painting, Liversidge is shown in academic dress, lecturing on the processes of reducing gold from its ores&#151;an image by which generations would remember him, long after his scientific statesmanship was forgotten.<br>
