<span class="headword">Sumner <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Heywood]</span>,  Mary Elizabeth</span>  (1828&#150;1921), <span class="occ">founder of the Mothers' Union</span>, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13191/', "Thomas Heywood (1797&#150;1866)")</script>, antiquary, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth Barton (<i>d</i>. 1870), was born on 31 December 1828 at the Barton family home at Swinton near Manchester. In 1832 Thomas Heywood retired from the family bank to live as a country gentleman, purchasing the estate of Hope End, Colwall, Herefordshire, from the father of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, the poet. Mary and her elder brother and sister were taught literature, mathematics, and music by their parents, and were taken abroad to learn languages. Mary showed exceptional talent in music: her father bought her an organ and engaged an Italian singing teacher in Rome, who suggested that she pursue an operatic career. However, during this visit she met her future husband, George Henry Sumner (1826&#150;1909), son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26784/', "Charles Richard Sumner")</script>, the bishop of Winchester, and soon himself to be ordained; the couple were married in Colwall church on 26 July 1848.<br>
<br>George and Mary Sumner lived first at Crawley, near Winchester, moving to Farnham Castle after the death of George's mother. Here, at the bishop's palace, two daughters were born. Soon afterwards George was appointed to the living of Old Alresford, where they remained for thirty-four years. In 1853 a son was born who would make his mark as the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38033/', "(George) Heywood Maunoir Sumner (1853&#150;1940)")</script>. Mary Sumner worked in the parish and played the organ. The family were joined in their substantial rectory by Mary's widowed mother, whose influence partly inspired the meetings for women which Mary began to hold in 1876. At first her visitors were women of her own class; then, boldly crossing the social boundaries, she invited the &#145;cottage mothers&#146;, whose long working hours in the fields provoked her concern. At the first meeting all were addressed by the rector, and in this informal way the Mothers' Union was anticipated (meetings were also held for husbands on Sunday evenings).<br>
<br>With her children married, Mary Sumner at just past fifty was ready for a new challenge. Then her husband became archdeacon, entailing a move to Winchester Cathedral Close; further preferment came with his appointment as suffragan bishop of Guildford, but they still resided at 1 The Close. Relieved of parochial duties, Mary Sumner concentrated on her ideas for a network of mothers' groups which would help women deepen their spiritual lives through <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading, prayer, and fellowship. The groups would benefit both church and society, strengthening family life through material influence for good and providing a meeting-ground for women of different social classes.<br>
<br>Knowing of her aspirations, the bishop of Newcastle asked her to speak at a church congress at Portsmouth in 1885: this proved to be the foundation of the Mothers' Union proper. It was established initially in Winchester diocese, with Mary Sumner herself as an active chairperson; this position she held until the age of eighty, always chairing the monthly diocesan Mothers' Union meetings until 1910, and frequently addressing large meetings throughout the country thereafter. Many other branches were soon launched, often by competent clergy wives, and they drew their members from a wide social spectrum. Meetings were interdenominational, concentrating on devotional and practical topics. Mary Sumner became a well-known figure as the Mothers' Union spread to other dioceses and to the colonies. In her pamphlets, and in a journal which she co-edited with Charlotte Yonge, she dwelt on the subjects of <span class="roman">Bible</span> reading and prayer, although showing a considerable breadth of knowledge and an awareness of family problems.<br>
<br>The Edwardian period saw the heyday of Mary Sumner and her new movement: it was heavily patronized by royalty and titled ladies, who saw it as a bastion of respectability in an age of growing emancipation. For their diamond wedding in 1908 the Sumners were given a large triptych screen, painted and illuminated by women and signed by Queen Alexandra and other royal and aristocratic supporters (this now hangs in Mary Sumner House, the world-wide headquarters of the Mothers' Union).<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1909 Mary Sumner continued to speak, write, and work for the movement, living at 1 The Close but often travelling alone to London by train. She frequently visited and entertained her numerous grandchildren. From her bedroom window she could see her husband's grave, where she finally joined him after her death at home on 9 August 1921. Her funeral service was attended by 4000 people, including representatives from Mothers' Union branches all over the country. It is true that she herself experienced few deprivations in her life, but sour comments about her affluence cannot conceal her vision, her understanding, and her dedicated commitment to her faith.<br>
