<span class="headword">Pakington, Sir  John</span>, fourth baronet  (1671&#150;1727), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 16 March 1671, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21147/', "Sir John Pakington, third baronet (c.1649&#150;1688)")</script>, politician, of Westwood, Worcestershire [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21146/', "Pakington, Sir John, second baronet")</script>], and his wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1647&#150;1690), the second daughter of Sir John Keyt, first baronet (1616&#150;1662), of Ebrington, Gloucestershire. Pakington's father prepared for his early demise by appointing Viscount Weymouth and his two brothers, James and Henry Frederick Thynne, as the guardians of his son. No doubt under their guidance Pakington matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, in October 1688. However, his stay there was short and he left without taking a degree in order to enter politics. When parliament was dissolved in February 1690 Pakington was still a minor, but he sought a seat at Droitwich, where he had inherited some fee farm rents and a small stake in the local salt industry. His pretensions were challenged by Philip Foley, and in defeat Pakington determined to stand for the county seat against the head of that family, Thomas Foley of Witley. He duly won a seat, defeating Foley's partner, Sir Francis Winnington.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer16901700"></a>Early political career, 1690&#150;1700</h2>Pakington's minority may explain the low-key beginning of his parliamentary career. However, it was assumed by observers that he would follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, taking his cue from their strongly royalist and Anglican opinions. In June 1690 he caught smallpox, but having recovered he was named in November to the Worcestershire lieutenancy, the first step towards asserting his family's power in local society. The next step was a favourable marriage, and on 28 August 1691 he was licensed to marry Frances (<i>c</i>.1672&#150;1697), the daughter of Henry Parker of Honington, Warwickshire, with a portion of &pound;4000. This marriage produced four sons and three daughters, though all but one daughter predeceased him. At this stage of his career Pakington was already being noted as sympathetic to the &#145;country&#146; reform programme, which was becoming increasingly attractive to the tory party, and he supported an attempt to enact triennial legislation in January 1693. Pakington's decision not to contest the 1695 election is difficult to explain, especially as he was involved in the Worcestershire campaign and also at Aylesbury, where he was lord of the manor. Out of parliament, he then lost his local offices in 1696 for refusing to sign the Association. Early in 1697 his wife died, bringing forth in Pakington, according to Sir Charles Lyttelton in a letter of March 1697, a desire &#145;to break up house and go abroad&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29578, fol. 615), in order to improve his education. However, by June 1697 he had abandoned any such plans.<br>
<br>Pakington re-entered parliament for Worcestershire in 1698, an election notable for a backlash against the court. Such a mood was much in keeping with Pakington's own views, and on 18 January 1699 he delivered an amusing speech in support of the <span class="roman">Disbanding Bill</span>, in which he singled out for criticism those who sought to justify a larger force by reference to the threat posed by the exiled James II. Pakington saw this as an empty threat unless King William's title was precarious, and he knew of only one man who had questioned it publicly. This was a sharp dig at Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, whose <span class="italic">Pastoral Letter</span> (1693) had argued that William's right to the throne was founded on conquest. Pakington's dislike of whig latitudinarian bishops resurfaced in the next session, when on 12 December 1699 he attacked Burnet as an inappropriate choice as preceptor to the duke of Gloucester, since the bishop was &#145;a republican in principle&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 130, fol. 406). A motion for Burnet's removal supported by Pakington was lost on the following day.<br>
<br>On 16 November 1700 Pakington married for the second time; his new wife was Hester (<i>c</i>.1672&#150;1715), the daughter and heir of Sir Herbert Perrott, of Haroldston, Pembrokeshire. By this match he acquired &#145;a good &pound;1,100 a year&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29579, fol. 242) and a small role in Welsh politics. The 1701 parliament saw him again preoccupied with the sins of whig bishops. Perhaps irked by rumours of Burnet's translation to the wealthy see of Winchester, on 8 March, after &#145;a very eloquent fine oration, long but admirably witty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Sir Richard Cocks</span>, 81), Pakington moved successfully for a bill preventing the translation of bishops. This bill, which also contained a clause against the practice of occasional conformity, never emerged from committee.<h2>
<a name="DefenceoftheChurchofEngland17011710"></a>Defence of the Church of England, 1701&#150;1710</h2>The second election of 1701 saw Pakington retain his seat by a mere fifteen votes in the face of concerted opposition from bishops Lloyd of Worcester and Talbot of Oxford. Indeed, his quarrel with Lloyd provoked Pakington into a defence of his views as a member of the Church of England and a believer in toleration. This battle with Lloyd was to grow more virulent during the 1702 election, when both sides entered into print to disparage their opponents. Lloyd used his episcopal visitation to campaign against Pakington, whom he criticized in private for debauchery and Jacobitism. <span class="italic">The True Character of a Churchman</span> was erroneously believed to be written by Lloyd, but it was distributed about the diocese by the bishop's allies. It was answered by <span class="italic">The Character of a Low Churchman</span>, a panegyric to Pakington penned by Henry Sacheverell. Pakington complained to the newly assembled House of Commons on 2 November 1702 of a breach of privilege, and on 18 November Lloyd and his son were voted &#145;malicious, unchristian and arbitrary&#146;, and the queen addressed to remove Lloyd from his post as lord almoner.<br>
<br>Pakington returned to the issue of occasional conformity in the 1703&#150;4 session. In a speech being distributed in tory circles in February 1704, he attacked those who remained neutral in matters pertaining to the church, a thinly veiled criticism of the leading ministers lords Godolphin and Marlborough, before referring to the role of dissenters in the civil wars and execution of Charles I: the whigs and their dissenting allies were &#145;a party of men that are against the church and government; whose principle of hatred and malice to the family of the Stuarts descends to them by inheritance&#146;  (Cobbett, <span class="italic">Parl. hist.</span>, 153&#150;4). He saw a bill against the practice of occasional conformity as designed to prevent hypocrisy (the taking of Anglican communion in order to qualify for political office) and to protect the Anglican monopoly of power. Without it, he prophesied the rise of dissent to a majority in parliament and an end to the Church of England. Such was his apocalyptic vision, born out of the experiences of his own family earlier in the century. Following the bill's defeat in the Lords, in the next session Pakington was a proponent of attaching the measure to a supply bill, an act dubbed &#145;the tack&#146;, in order to force it through the upper house.<br>
<br>At the 1705 election Pakington was more involved than ever in the campaign. He did not limit his activities to Worcestershire, but stood also at Aylesbury (where he had been elected in 1702, though chose to sit for Worcestershire) to protect his interest. The previous parliament had seen the culmination of the celebrated <i>Ashby v. White</i> case, which had begun as an attempt to undermine Pakington's interest and ended as a dispute between the two houses concerning the determination of the right to vote. Although narrowly defeated at Aylesbury, Pakington was re-elected for Worcestershire, his supporters carrying a banner proclaiming &#145;For the Queen and Church, Pakington&#146;. &#145;The tack&#146; and the supposed threat to the church played a large role in the election, with Bishop Lloyd again attacking his old adversary and even threatening to prosecute Pakington's supporters in the ecclesiastical courts. On this occasion the dispute between bishop and MP petered out, and there was even a reconciliation between the two men in September 1706 when Lloyd confirmed Pakington's daughter.<br>
<br>Three of Pakington's speeches survive for the 1705&#150;6 session. His principles refused to allow him to support the tories' cynical attempt on 4 December 1705 to embarrass the ministry by proposing an address to the queen that the electress of Hanover should be invited to reside in England. However, he was stirred into action on 8 December when it was proposed that the Commons endorse a resolution passed by the House of Lords that the Church of England was in a flourishing condition. He responded by listing four dangers to the church: the freedom to publish pamphlets against the church; the increase in the number of dissenting academies; the increase in the number of conventicles; and the influence of the kirk in Scotland, which could again be used in conjunction with English dissent to threaten the church (as in the civil wars). In this Pakington could be seen as putting in coherent form the inchoate fears of his high Anglican brethren. He also felt it necessary to criticize the <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> on 19 December, which he saw as putting the armed forces and the revenue into the hands of a group of regents who might endanger the succession. He preferred the traditional authority of parliament and privy council. Pakington viewed the impending union with Scotland with trepidation. He was particularly concerned for the fate of episcopalianism north of the border and the attendant threat to the Church of England posed by state-sponsored Presbyterianism in Scotland. Thus on 4 February 1707 he attacked the union as being carried by bribery and force and reflected so severely on the ministry that he risked being sent to the Tower of London.<br>
<br>In the 1707&#150;8 session Pakington was relatively quiet, and it is possible that Robert Harley had promised him office in a revamped Board of Trade as part of a scheme to reconstruct the ministry. In the event Harley lost office in a power struggle in February 1708. At the general election in May of that year Pakington was returned unopposed. In the new parliament he was soon involved in yet another tory <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>&#151;the battle to prevent a new charter being foisted upon Bewdley in order to facilitate whig control of the borough. His &#145;flaming speech&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wentworth Papers</span>, 70) when the election was decided at the bar of the house on 8 February 1709 was eventually published in the more propitious circumstances of 1710&#150;11. Most startlingly he compared the silent surrender of Bewdley's charter unfavourably to the arbitrary surrenders of James II's reign. In the following session he voted against the impeachment of his erstwhile champion from 1702, Dr Sacheverell.<h2>
<a name="TheHarleyministry17101714"></a>The Harley ministry, 1710&#150;1714</h2>With the return of the tories to power under Robert Harley in 1710, Pakington may again have harboured hopes of office. Certainly Lord Weymouth was pressing for his inclusion in the new Board of Trade, but Harley's predilection for moderates no doubt precluded Pakington. Instead Pakington concentrated his parliamentary energies on bringing the defeated whig ministry to account for their mismanagement. Thus, on 31 May 1711, as part of a long representation to the queen, the surrender of Bewdley's charter was voted illegal and destructive of the constitution. Pakington was also a member of the tory back-bench pressure group the October Club, which was dedicated to forcing a more complete tory policy upon the ministry. In order to buy off some of this opposition, in the summer of 1711 Harley (by then Lord Oxford) decided to take more tories into office, and Pakington accepted a secret pension of &pound;800 per annum on the Irish establishment (paid under the name of Edwards). Possibly because of his pension, in the 1711&#150;12 session Pakington was noticeably more restrained in his attacks on the ministry, although he still deemed the misdeeds of the previous administration and the duke of Marlborough as legitimate targets, speaking against the latter in January 1712. In June 1712 Pakington was rebuffed when he approached Lord Oxford for a public mark of the queen's favour, rather than his pension, which was technically in breach of the place legislation then in force.<br>
<br>By 1713 Pakington was a keen advocate of a more active strategy in support of the Pretender, which sought to make public the regents named by the elector of Hanover under the <span class="roman">Regency Act</span> (and widely reputed to be whigs) and then have them voted enemies of the constitution. In this scenario, the ensuing crisis would destroy the ministry and the <span class="roman">Act of Settlement</span> could then be overturned. This aggressive strategy was vetoed by the Pretender, who preferred to rely on the assurances of the Oxford ministry. Returned in the 1713 election, Pakington was one of those tories who hoped for a lead from Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke, locked into a power struggle with Oxford, was keen for Jacobite support. Indeed, in late July 1714 rumours circulated of Pakington's imminent appointment to a new Treasury board. The queen's death on 1 August was thus a huge blow to Pakington's hopes. Indeed, he was so upset that on 6 August he sought to have the eminent physician Dr John Radcliffe expelled from the Commons for not attending the queen's sickbed.<h2>
<a name="Laterpoliticalcareer17151727"></a>Later political career, 1715&#150;1727</h2>Despite unpropitious circumstances, Pakington topped the poll for Worcestershire in the 1715 election, once again falling out with Bishop Lloyd. The outbreak of the Jacobite rising later in the year saw Pakington arrested at Westwood. Forewarned of the event, he was able to arrange a comfortable trip to London in a stagecoach and upon his arrival convinced the privy council of his innocence. Although the exiled Stuarts continued to regard him as a potential supporter, it would seem that he was unwilling to countenance an armed insurrection backed by foreign troops to secure a restoration.<br>
<br>In the 1715 parliament Pakington was an active opponent of the whig ministry, speaking against the <span class="roman">Peerage Bill</span> in December 1719. Having been returned again in 1722 he opposed the re-election of Spencer Compton as speaker, although he could not find a seconder. However, he remained a popular figure with the opposition, even being elected recorder of Worcester in 1726.<br>
<br>Pakington died on 13 August 1727, shortly after the dissolution, thereby allowing the only surviving son of his second marriage, Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington, fifth baronet, an easy accession to his seat in parliament. His will, written three days before his death, ordered that his body be interred in the parish church of Hampton Lovett, Worcestershire. A monument in the church referred to his parliamentary service in &#145;speaking his mind there without reserve, neither fearing nor flattering those in power, but despising all their offers of title and preferment upon base and dishonourable terms of compliance&#146;  (Nash, 1.539). This outspokenness, at once vituperative and partisan, makes it unlikely that Pakington was the model for Joseph Addison's amiable tory squire Sir Roger de Coverley in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, as used sometimes to be thought.<br>
