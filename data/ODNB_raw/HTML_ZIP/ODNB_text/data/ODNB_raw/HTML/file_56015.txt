<span class="headword">Kingsmill,  Joseph</span>  (1805/6&#150;1865), <span class="occ">penologist and prison chaplain</span>, was born in co. Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of Thomas Kingsmill. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1826, was prizeman in classics and divinity, and proceeded to his BA in 1831 and MA in 1836. He was ordained deacon in 1831 by the bishop of Dromore and presented by the bishop of Chester in 1832. His historical significance is in his role as chaplain to Pentonville prison.<br>
<br>Pentonville &#145;model prison&#146; received its first intake on 21 December 1842 and was f&ecirc;ted as the most important breakthrough in penal discipline of the age. Constructed in tiered lines of cells radiating from a central block it aimed to ensure the perfect operation of the separate system. In this system prisoners were isolated in individual cells, even attending chapel in separate cubicles, and were subjected to a battery of reforming influences in cell education, catechization, admonition, trade training, and so forth. The theory was that, with psychological defences broken down and mutual corruption ended by cellular isolation, prisoners would emerge from Pentonville at least reformed and at best converted to a sense of personal redemption and relationship with Christ. Pentonville was set up as the model for others to admire and emulate. It held a daily average of 500 men all sentenced to transportation and sent to Australasia on completion of the first eighteen months (subsequently reduced to nine) in Pentonville. In the late 1850s this nine months' separation formed the initial phase of penal servitude, which replaced transportation, and the prisoners went on to associated labour in Portland thereafter.<br>
<br>Kingsmill was appointed assistant chaplain to the Revd J. Ralph when the prison opened, but a year later was promoted to chaplain, with his assistant between 1844 and 1855 another noted protagonist of separation, John Burt. Kingsmill served in this office until 1859 and his governor throughout was Robert Hosking. The prison was at first superintended by a committee including designers of the Victorian cellular prison, Joshua Jebb, William Crawford, and Whitworth Russell, and subsequently became one of the convict prisons supervised by Jebb, now chairman of the directors of convict prisons and a staunch supporter of Kingsmill. Initially in Kingsmill's department were the assistant chaplain, principal schoolmaster, and his three assistant schoolmasters. He was responsible for ensuring three Sunday services, each with sermon, visiting all prisoners in their cells or hospital to instruct, persuade, and comfort them, supervising the library, and advising as to the reformatory impact of the prison on individuals and collectively. Between 1845 and 1855 he carried out over 100,000 cell visits and spent between ten and twelve hours daily at the prison.<br>
<br>Kingsmill was a significant figure in the spread of the separate system throughout the country, for Pentonville, alongside Reading, was lauded as a demonstration of the system. He ardently publicized his work and views in annual reports published by parliament and in books and pamphlets, of which <span class="italic">Chapters on Prisons and Prisoners</span> (three editions after 1849) was best known. He also gave evidence to the 1847 House of Lords committee on criminal law, transportation, and reformatories for juvenile offenders. Kingsmill theorized that recidivist criminality was progressive and thrived in overcrowded, miserable homes with criminal or vicious parents and in criminogenic neighbourhoods with numerous temptations to vice, such as dance-halls, taverns, and concert rooms, with individuals descending into street or lodging-house dwelling, sexual licence, generalized addiction to drink, and ultimately recidivism. However his distinctive contribution was the notion that the first link in the progressive chain was a choice made by the individual to reject Christ. This first step was the necessary precursor of the rest.<br>
<br>The aim of Kingsmill's approach was therefore at best to reconcile the prisoner with God through Christ, or at least to achieve moral change. Arguing that technical education merely made a thief a better-educated thief, he insisted on a moral and spiritual base for all parts of the regime. He wanted basic education in prison to ensure understanding of Christian and moral truths and competence in the workplace outside, and distrusted more advanced education of prisoners as harmful diversion. He insisted that congregate prison discipline, no matter how regulated, resulted in corruption, and that only separation could make possible inner reformation. He was well aware that prison conversions could be feigned or short-lived, but was sure that Christian prison officers, the reverse of the stereotype of the earlier dissolute, foul-mouthed turnkeys, had huge potential for influence in the separate system. Indeed his <span class="italic">Address to Officers in Charge of Prisoners</span> (1853) was distributed by the directors of convict prisons to every officer in the service. He opposed reduction of the separation part of the transportation or penal servitude sentence from eighteen to nine months, and did battle with those who argued that separation caused insanity. He also strongly supported the new reformatories for juvenile offenders.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his ministry Kingsmill realized that the potential of separation for conversion had been exaggerated, but he continued to extol it on grounds of its general moral, penal, and deterrent value. In addition, with some reservations, he welcomed the end of transportation in favour of penal servitude, for he distrusted the former disposal as tending to undo the moral gains made in separation. In addition he was one of that group of prison chaplains who, like John Clay of Preston, established a body of empirical criminological knowledge. Kingsmill surveyed cohorts of prisoners in order to measure their education, knowledge, and recidivism using case description and quantitative analysis.<br>
<br>Kingsmill retired from Pentonville in 1860 and was replaced by his assistant Ambrose Sherwin, who had recently succeeded John Burt, who had taken a full prison chaplaincy in Birmingham. In that year also retired his governor, Hosking. Kingsmill had suffered considerable ill health. Almost at once the stalled cubicles in the chapel at Pentonville were demolished, for the era of severe moralistic evangelicalism in prisons, of which Kingsmill was an important representative, was passing in favour of a much more pessimistic approach to prison discipline.<br>
<br>Kingsmill feared the expansion of the Roman Catholic church (see his <span class="italic">On the Idolatry of the Church of Rome</span>, 1836) and resisted attempts to establish Catholic ministry to prisons, although he facilitated access to a Roman Catholic priest if a Catholic prisoner specifically pressed for this (see his <span class="italic">Roman Catholic Chaplains to Gaols</span>, 1854). He also advocated strong protestant missionary activity, and his <span class="italic">British Rule and British Christianity in India</span> (1859), <span class="italic">Missions and Missionaries Historically Viewed</span> (1853), and <span class="italic">Ojibura Indians &hellip; of British America</span> (1855) reflected this. In conventional evangelical style he vigorously demanded the keeping of the sabbath in <span class="italic">The Sabbath: the Working Man's True Charter</span> (1856). Kingsmill's wife was named as Margaret Thomas Kingsmill at the swearing of his probate: it is not known when they married. He held no living after his retirement, and died aged fifty-nine of &#145;bronchitis, after a long illness&#146; on 25 December 1865 at his home, 142 Marina, St Leonards, Sussex  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). As his widow was his universal legatee, it seems likely that they had no children.<br>
