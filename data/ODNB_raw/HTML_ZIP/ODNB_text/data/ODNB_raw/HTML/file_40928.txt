<span class="headword">Leeper,  (Alexander Wigram) Allen</span>  (1887&#150;1935), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 4 January 1887 in Melbourne, Australia, the elder of the two sons of Alexander Leeper (1848&#150;1934), warden of Trinity College, Melbourne, and his first wife, Adeline Marian (1853&#150;1893), the eldest daughter of Sir George Wigram Allen, politician and philanthropist. His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55366/', "Reginald Wildig Allen Leeper")</script>, was also a diplomatist. His father, a southern Irish protestant by descent, was fiercely loyal to the British empire. Leeper was educated at the Church of England grammar school, Melbourne, where he became head of school, and then at his father's college before proceeding in 1908 to Balliol College, Oxford. Having taken a first in Latin and Greek at Melbourne, he went on to take a first in Greats at Oxford in 1911. He found employment as an assistant in the Egyptian and Assyrian department of the British Museum in December 1912, which led to the publication of <span class="italic">Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum</span> (1920).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of war in 1914 Leeper attempted to enlist but was rejected as medically unfit, even for home defence. Determined to contribute to the war effort, he finally found war work in the propaganda department (Wellington House), moving from there to the intelligence bureau of the department of information. One of Leeper's colleagues was R. W. Seton-Watson, the proprietor of the journal <span class="italic">New Europe</span>. Leeper began to write for <span class="italic">New Europe</span> under the pseudonym Belisarius. He became particularly interested in Romanian issues, wrote a slim volume entitled <span class="italic">The Justice of Rumania's Cause</span> (1917), and was one of the founders of the Anglo-Roumanian Society, for which he acted as honorary secretary. He was also the author of several numbers of <span class="italic">The Times History of the War</span>.<br>
<br>In March 1918 most members of the intelligence bureau moved to the Foreign Office to form the nucleus of the new political intelligence department, which played a central role in British planning for the Paris peace conference. Leeper arrived in Paris in December 1918 and remained there, without a break, until 1920, working throughout for the Foreign Office section on Balkan affairs. He was appointed one of the British members of the Romanian and Yugoslav territorial claims commission and, because the senior British member, Sir Eyre Crowe, was occupied with other aspects of the peace conference, came to play an important role in drawing the frontiers of the new Europe. The communist seizure of power in Hungary caused great concern among the allies, and when, in April 1919, it was decided to send a special mission under Jan Smuts both to discuss regional issues with the new regime and possibly to open a line of communication to Lenin's government in Russia, Leeper was chosen to accompany him. In September 1919 he accompanied Sir George Clerk on his special mission to Romania to secure the evacuation of its army from Hungary. His knowledge of south-eastern European issues was by this time sufficient for his name to be considered (alongside that of Arnold Toynbee) for the newly established Koraes chair in Greek studies at King's College, London.<br>
<br>After returning from the Paris peace conference Leeper was appointed a regular member of the Foreign Office, with the rank of second secretary, in March 1920. He became assistant private secretary to the foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, in December 1920, acquiring great influence with Curzon and being almost wholly responsible for initiating a more open relationship with the press. On 2 April 1921 he married Janet Christina Monteith Hamilton (<i>b</i>. 1898/9), daughter of Vereker Monteith Hamilton, artist, and niece of General Sir Ian Hamilton. They had one daughter. In February 1924 Leeper was promoted to first secretary and seconded to Australia to advise the prime minister, Stanley Bruce, on the reorganization of that country's department of external affairs. His report was described by J. R. Poynter as &#145;an important document in the history of Australian foreign policy&#146;  (Poynter, &#145;Leeper, Alexander&#146;, 56). On his return from Australia Leeper was appointed first secretary at the Vienna legation in December 1924. He used his spare time while posted there to begin a study, published posthumously, <span class="italic">A History of Medieval Austria</span> (1941). While in Vienna he witnessed the &#145;pan-European&#146; congress and was the only Foreign Office official to take the idea seriously. He warned that Europe would ultimately form an economic bloc and that Britain would have to decide whether to be in or out.<br>
<br>In November 1928 Leeper returned to London as a member of the League of Nations and western department and in August 1933 became its head upon his promotion to counsellor. His main work now came to concern arms control, and he was intimately involved in the Geneva disarmament conference. He worked closely with his chief, and old friend, Sir Robert Vansittart, sharing to some degree his world-view. Leeper in particular worked on the British proposal for the prohibition of aerial bombardment on the territory or shipping of another state, attempting to find a solution that maintained Britain's ability to deploy air power in the policing of its empire while giving it some measure of protection from aerial attack. A strong supporter of the League of Nations as a vehicle for improving international relations, he was prompted to adjust his views by the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany.<br>
<br>A gifted linguist, Leeper could read fifteen languages with ease and converse in seven or eight. Together with his brother, he was an exponent of Britain pursuing cultural diplomacy. His principal recreational interests were reading, travel, and Shakespeare's plays. Religiously devout, he moved from the Anglican evangelical environment of his youth to Anglo-Catholicism. A deeply humane and modest person, he could, when necessary, forcefully argue a case to a senior figure with an unflinching courage. He was appointed CBE (1920) and CMG (1935). He died at 5 Collingham Gardens, Earls Court, London, on 24 January 1935, following the rupture of his gall-bladder. He was survived by his wife and daughter.<br>
