<span class="headword">Serlo</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1104), <span class="occ">abbot of Gloucester</span>, was a canon at Avranches and a Benedictine monk at Mont-St Michel, in Normandy, before being appointed to the abbacy of St Peter's, Gloucester, in 1072. Before the conquest Gloucester Abbey would not have been singled out as one of the leading English monasteries, having only two monks and eight novices, but by the end of Serlo's life there were 100 monks and it stood out as a model house. As far as architectural history can be reconstructed from written sources, it seems that the extensions made to the Old Minster at Gloucester in 1058 by Ealdred, archbishop of York, had been intended to provide a suitable setting for royal crown-wearing ceremonies rather than for meeting the monks' needs. Ealdred had also been able to transfer some of the abbey's most valuable estates to the archbishopric of York because the abbot of Gloucester was his kinsman.<br>
<br>The opportunity for a transformation in the abbey's fortunes came in 1088 when baronial rebels, intent on ensuring that William II would not be able to organize crown-wearing ceremonies at Gloucester after the example of his father, attacked and seriously damaged the abbey during the civil war of royal succession. The attack formed part of a wider aristocratic reaction against the church in western England. William II's response was to help Gloucester Abbey in every way possible during the rest of his reign. He and eighteen of his barons donated a substantial number of estates to the abbey, and the monks were never again the victims of aristocratic unrest during the Anglo-Norman period. In 1089 the bishop of Hereford laid the foundation stone of the great new church at Gloucester and became the abbey's patron. In 1095 the archbishop of York was forced to return the disputed estates which Ealdred had taken over, after resisting royal writs and orders of restitution for twenty-five years. William II granted Serlo and the monks of Gloucester a privilege that gave them the whole of each sturgeon caught in their fisheries across the realm. Serlo was once able to persuade Wulfstan, bishop of Worcester, to honour the brethren's refectory by staying for dinner, and the wealth of the food led one young layman to mock the gluttony of the bishop and his hosts.<br>
<br>Under Serlo's leadership the abbey became a centre of spirituality and the scene of great ecclesiastical events. On 6 March 1093 Anselm was proclaimed as the new archbishop of Canterbury in Gloucester Abbey, and the bishop of Worcester and the abbot of Shrewsbury preached sermons and baptized people there. On these visits to Gloucester, Wulfstan performed two miracles and the abbot prophesied the demise of William II on the day before the latter's death. Miracles were performed more frequently at the abbey church than might be expected, perhaps because holy men in western England wanted regularly to visit Serlo and the new Norman-style church. The new building was eventually consecrated on 15 July 1100.<br>
<br>William of Malmesbury commented that Serlo of Gloucester was one of the three great abbots whose spirituality and rule over their abbeys distinguished them from all other ecclesiastics in England after the conquest, and Godfrey of Winchester noted in a poem that Serlo &#145;pleased the very princes whom he reproved&#146;  (Wright, 2.154). Serlo died on 3 or 4 March 1104 after more than thirty years as abbot. His achievement was to provide Gloucester Abbey with monumental architecture and an impressive monastic reputation, which enabled it successfully to replace its earlier role as a royal ceremonial church.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25100"></a><span class="headword">Serlo</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1147<span class="mult">x</span>9), <span class="occ">abbot of Cirencester</span>, also had connections in Gloucestershire, but should not be confused with the abbot of Gloucester of that name. He was the son of Sired the blacksmith and Leofl&aelig;d. He may have joined the monastic chapter at Salisbury Cathedral as a novice, and some time between 1111 and 1125 he became dean of the chapter. By 1125 he had moved to join the new Augustinian foundation at Merton in Surrey. Roger, bishop of Salisbury, had persuaded Henry I to grant Merton special privileges, and Serlo probably represented Roger's interests there. In 1129 Serlo and his mother sold the land which they owned in Gloucester to St Peter's Abbey with the agreement of Serlo's son, Bartholomew. The involvement of both mother and son in the sale raises the possibility that family land was being disposed of, and that Serlo may have had local connections in Gloucestershire. If so, it may have been a factor in his promotion to Cirencester. John of Worcester records that Cirencester College in Gloucestershire was refounded as an Augustinian abbey by Henry I in 1117, and Serlo was consecrated as the first abbot in 1131. The lands of the priest Regenbald, the chaplain of Edward the Confessor, were given by the king to the community in 1133. Bishop Roger of Salisbury may have played an important role in securing this gift for Cirencester, since he retained a life interest over the properties of Regenbald. Thanks to the patronage of the bishop of Salisbury, when Serlo died, on 30 January some time between 1147 and 1149, the community at Cirencester had a very secure endowment. It may be that Roger had also taken a personal interest in furthering the career of Serlo, who rose from being the son of an Anglo-Saxon blacksmith to become the ruler of one of the foremost centres of twelfth-century monasticism.<br>
