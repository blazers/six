<span class="headword">Davie,  Donald Alfred</span>  (1922&#150;1995), <span class="occ">poet and literary critic</span>, was born on 17 July 1922 in Barnsley, Yorkshire, the son of George Davie (<i>d</i>. 1965), a shopkeeper and deacon of the local Baptist chapel, and his wife, Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sugden (<i>d</i>. 1968), a schoolteacher. He was educated at Holgate grammar school, Barnsley, and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he won a scholarship to read English in 1940. His university education was interrupted by wartime service in the Royal Navy, which took him to Ceylon, India, Iceland, and Russia. On his return home with the navy to Plymouth in 1944 he met Doreen John (<i>b</i>. 1920), whom he married on 13 January 1945; they had two sons and a daughter. He resumed his studies at Cambridge, where he graduated in 1947 (MA, 1949) and stayed on as a research student; he was awarded his PhD in 1951.<br>
<br>From 1950 until 1957 Davie was a lecturer in English at Trinity College, Dublin; he spent the academic year 1957&#150;8 as a visiting professor at the University of California before returning to Cambridge as a lecturer and, from 1959, fellow of Gonville and Caius College. In 1964, after a second visit to the USA as a visiting lecturer at the University of Cincinnati, he joined the new University of Essex as professor of literature, and became pro-vice-chancellor a year later: it seemed an ideal opportunity to counter what he saw as the cultural insularity of Cambridge, but the student riots of 1968, and the university's tepid response to them, completed his disillusionment with English academic life. In 1968 he succeeded Yvor Winters, one of his literary mentors, as professor of English at Stanford University, California; ten years later he moved to Vanderbilt University, Tennessee, where he remained until 1988. He and Doreen then retired to the Devon village of Silverton, near Exeter.<br>
<br>Donald Davie belongs to that small and distinguished company of poet&#150;critics (such as Matthew Arnold, William Empson, and Yvor Winters) who are equally poets and critics; the restless concerns of the creative writer and the academic continually reinforce one another. His first two critical books, <span class="italic">Purity of Diction in English Verse</span> (1952) and <span class="italic">Articulate Energy</span> (1955), seem respectively to define and to extend the literary principles of those poets who became known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93790', "Movement")</script>, just as his own first collection of poems, <span class="italic">Brides of Reason</span> (1955), despite its ironic intelligence and metrical orthodoxy, already hints at impatience with the Movement's limited agenda: &#145;A neutral tone is nowadays preferred&#146;, he writes  (<span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1990, 35), but the passive voice fails to endorse the preference as his own. Inclusion in Robert Conquest's influential anthology <span class="italic">New Lines</span> (1956) brought Davie's poetry to a wider public, while his second collection, <span class="italic">A Winter Talent</span> (1957), contains some of the outstanding English poems of the 1950s, such as the haunting &#145;Time passing, beloved&#146; and the wry &#145;Heigh-ho on a winter afternoon&#146;: &#145;Yes, I have &#147;mellowed&#148;, as you said I would&#146;  (ibid., 74).<br>
<br>But &#145;mellowing&#146; was not quite Davie's style, and his literary career proved as unpredictable as his academic one. Instead of producing another conventional slim volume of verse, he now wrote <span class="italic">The Forests of Lithuania</span> (1958), a version of Adam Mickiewicz's epic poem <span class="italic">Pan Tadeusz</span>, and a series of poems about American history, <span class="italic">A Sequence for Francis Parkman</span> (1961); meanwhile, his <span class="italic">New and Selected Poems</span> (1961), including the ambitious and enigmatic &#145;With the grain&#146;&#151;a poem which, like some of his major essays, worries at the vexed question of poetry's relationships with the other arts&#151;appeared in the USA. His next critical work was equally unexpected, but <span class="italic">The Heyday of Sir Walter Scott</span> (1961) views its subject, like Mickiewicz and Parkman, as an explorer of the wilderness. Davie was also already engaged in a lifelong tussle with the work of Pound; <span class="italic">Ezra Pound: Poet as Sculptor</span> (1964) was the first of his three books on the poet (the others appeared in 1975 and 1991). Drawing on his travels both in Europe and in America, his next collection of poems, <span class="italic">Events and Wisdoms</span> (1964), was thematically and formally his most wide-ranging so far: &#145;Touched by that wand of transit, / Californian, hopeful &hellip;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 131), he playfully embraces American idioms and looks back with guarded nostalgia to his Barnsley childhood.<br>
<br>In 1964 Davie could not have foreseen the unhappy conclusion of his Essex years nor the fraught circumstances of his more permanent self-exile; nor, indeed, that this difficult period would produce outstanding poetry. For <span class="italic">Essex Poems</span> (1969) matches bleak East Anglian (and, in a postscript, Iowan) landscapes with a finely pared-down diction. When, in &#145;Ezra Pound in Pisa&#146;, he writes &#145;Excellence is sparse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 142), it could stand as epigraph for the entire collection, as could a heartfelt couplet from the final poem, &#145;Or, solitude&#146;: &#145;The metaphysicality / Of poetry, how I need it!&#146;  (ibid., 155). But <span class="italic">Essex Poems</span> is far from being a farewell to England: once in America, Davie became even more preoccupied with his home country, not only bombarding it with acerbic poems and articles, but publishing <span class="italic">Thomas Hardy and British Poetry</span> (1972), in which he argued that Hardy (rather than Yeats, Eliot, or Pound) was the most influential figure in twentieth-century British poetry, and <span class="italic">The Shires</span> (1974), an edgily reflective county-by-county sequence of poems.<br>
<br>A conservative, pipe-puffing and sometimes blunt-speaking Yorkshireman, Davie might have been an incongruous figure on a 1970s, west-coast campus; but he got on well with America, as his teasingly elliptical autobiography, <span class="italic">These the Companions</span> (1982), demonstrates, and he was an enthusiastic advocate of American poets such as Lorine Niedecker and Edward Dorn. In 1976 he returned temporarily to Cambridge to give the Clark lectures, on &#145;The literature of the English dissenting interest&#146;, and these were published as <span class="italic">A Gathered Church</span> (1978): this also marked a return to the theological concerns he had touched on as long ago as 1958 in his anthology <span class="italic">The Late Augustans</span> and which he further explored in his <span class="italic">New Oxford Book of Christian Verse</span> (1981). He had been received into the Anglican communion in 1972, and his later poetry became increasingly Christian in its focus. Meanwhile, <span class="italic">In the Stopping Train</span> appeared in 1977: the long, disturbing title poem analyses a divided self, the &#145;I who has to be punished&#146; and &#145;the man going mad inside me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 285). <span class="italic">To Scorch or Freeze</span> (1988) is a sequence of fragmented psalms, to which the ten-part meditation &#145;Our father&#146; in the posthumously published <span class="italic">Poems and Melodramas</span> (1996) forms a coda; his <span class="roman">Penguin Classics</span> edition of <span class="italic">The Psalms in English</span> also appeared in 1996.<br>
<br>Although Davie published no entirely new full-length critical books after <span class="italic">A Gathered Church</span>, he remained a prolific, often controversial, essayist and reviewer. Many of his occasional pieces were collected in <span class="italic">The Poet in the Imaginary Museum</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">Trying to Explain</span> (1979), and in the late 1980s he began to reorganize his shorter critical pieces into a series of thematic volumes, starting with <span class="italic">Under Briggflatts: a History of Poetry in Great Britain, 1960&#150;1988</span> (1989). The project continued after his death with volumes edited by his widow and Clive Wilmer. Donald Davie died of cancer at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter on 18 September 1995; he was buried on 22 September in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Silverton.<br>
