<span class="headword">Sigeberht</span>  (<em>fl. </em>630/31&#150;654), <span class="occ">king of the East Angles</span>, is known only from Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</span>, where it is stated that he was the brother of Earpwald, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23265/', "R&#230;dwald")</script>. William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester say that he was Earpwald's half-brother by his mother. It is uncertain whether they had additional information or whether they were reading more into Bede's wording than may have been intended. So it is an open question whether Sigeberht was R&aelig;dwald's son or his stepson. During R&aelig;dwald's reign he was in exile in Francia, where he was converted to Christianity and baptized. After the death in 627 or 628 of Earpwald, R&aelig;dwald's successor, a period of three years' disorder ensued in East Anglia. After Sigeberht became king, in 630 or 631, he obtained the help of Felix, a Burgundian ordained in Francia. Felix had come to Honorius, archbishop of Canterbury, who sent him to East Anglia. He was given an episcopal <i>sedes</i> at &#145;Dommoc&#146;, which may have been Dunwich, or Felixstowe, or somewhere else. With Felix's assistance Sigeberht set up a school for children, after the model of those at Canterbury. He patronized an Irish monk, Fursa, and gave him the site for a monastery at Cnobheresburg. The oft-repeated statement that this was at Burgh Castle, Suffolk, is probably erroneous. At some stage (probably somewhat before, possibly long before, 654) Sigeberht resigned the kingdom to his kinsman Ecgric, who had previously been ruling a subordinate part, and entered a monastery. The statement of the twelfth-century <span class="italic">Liber Eliensis</span> that this was at Betricheswor&eth;e (later Bury St Edmunds) is untrustworthy. Upon Penda, king of the Mercians, assaulting East Anglia, Sigeberht was urged to leave his monastery and lead the army. He did so, reluctantly; but he would not bear arms, carrying only a rod into the battle in which he was killed. Bede's summary indications are of a career of interest and importance, not least for its place in a context of relations with Frankish Gaul. That Sigeberht's name was one borne by Frankish kings and that he spent his exile in Gaul are, like the Merovingian coins at Sutton Hoo, suggestive of a stronger East Anglian connection with Francia than is directly demonstrable.<br>
