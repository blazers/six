<span class="headword">Train,  George Francis</span>  (1829&#150;1904), <span class="occ">promoter of the horse tramway</span>, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 24 March 1829, the son of a merchant, Oliver Train. His father's last traceable act was to send him back alone by sea to England at the age of four after his mother had died of yellow fever in New Orleans. He was brought up by his grandmother on her farm at Waltham.<br>
<br>Train became a grocer's boy at the age of fourteen but then, when he was sixteen, he got a job as shipping clerk with his uncle, Enoch Train. Five years later he was sent to manage the Liverpool end of his uncle's very successful White Diamond shipping line and concurrently seems to have obtained a financial interest in shipping out of California during the Australian gold rush. He was in Melbourne from 1853 to 1855. When Enoch Train's business got into difficulties in 1856&#150;7, his nephew went back to America. On 5 October 1851 he married Wilhelmina Wilkinson Davis (<i>d</i>. 1879) at Louisville, Kentucky, USA; they had four children.<br>
<br>Horse-drawn street railways, known for decades in New York, were then attracting greater attention from entrepreneurs in other cities, some lines being built on the tongue-and-groove system, flush with the road surface, and others using L-shaped rails, along which the cars could run on ordinary wheels; the latter system had the great disadvantage that the vertical part of the &#145;L&#146; protruded above the road surface and interfered with all other traffic. Whichever system was used, however, the reduced rolling resistance on smooth rails meant that two horses could pull a much larger vehicle, capable of seating forty-eight fare-paying passengers in greater comfort&#151;twenty-four inside and twenty-four more out in the open on top&#151;twice as many as the competing two-horse omnibus.<br>
<br>A self-confident salesman, Train was hired to secure franchises for street railways of the L-type, first in the United States and then in Europe. Here the <i>chemin de fer am&eacute;ricain</i> had been demonstrated by Alphonse Loubat from 1853 in Paris, where it had been seen by the English engineer William Joseph Curtis while visiting the international exhibition there in 1855. In the following year Curtis took out a patent for a tramcar with two sets of wheels which could be lowered independently, one set flanged to run on grooved lines and one flat to run on paved roads. Vehicles of this adaptable sort were already being run on the busy dock road in Liverpool in 1859 before Train's arrival there. His proposal to operate at lower fares was turned down by the dock board on 3 February 1860.<br>
<br>Having produced a fifty-page publicity pamphlet, Train tried his luck on the other side of the River Mersey with the road authority at Birkenhead. He obtained its consent and managed to get local financial support for the Birkenhead Street Railway Company Ltd, incorporated on 7 May 1860, to lay an L-shaped track from Woodside Ferry to Birkenhead Park, about 1&frac14; miles away. This took six weeks to lay and was opened on 30 August 1860. Train himself contributed only a quarter of the capital and had nothing to do with the actual construction of the line. The double-deck tramcar was made by Robert Main, a local coach builder. This tramway managed to survive, but no thanks to Train; the main local shareholder soon replaced the objectionable protruding rails.<br>
<br>Train then turned his attention to London, where Curtis already had a tramway running in Islington and where the London General Omnibus Company had been showing an interest in tramways for three years. Train showered all the road authorities with his pamphlet and also with applications to run demonstration stretches of line. Only three were successful. As at Birkenhead they were all financed and engineered by others but, unlike at Birkenhead, only single-deckers were used and all the rails soon had to be removed. The Bayswater line, running less than a mile west of Marble Arch, down Bayswater Road, was opened on 25 March 1861 but closed before the end of September. The Victoria Street line was laid for a short distance down the road towards the new Victoria Station from Westminster Abbey, and opened on 15 May 1861, but was removed on 7 March 1862. The Surrey Side Tramway, from the south side of Westminster Bridge to Kennington Gate, opened on 15 August 1861 and was removed on 21 June 1862.<br>
<br>Three other tramways were embarked upon in the provinces before the full extent of failure in London was appreciated. One ran for about a mile from the Liverpool borough boundary along the Prescot turnpike to the Old Swan: opened on 2 July 1861, it closed before the end of May 1862, when the track began to be removed. A short and ill-located line was opened in Darlington on 1 January 1862 but closed before November 1865, when the tramway company went into liquidation. The third line ran in the Potteries from Foundry Street, Hanley, to Burslem. It was opened on 13 January 1862 but survived, as at Birkenhead, only after the leading shareholder replaced the protruding step rails.<br>
<br>Train returned to the United States in 1862. The rest of his flamboyant life was concerned mainly with the financing of railway land grants in America, travelling the world, writing, and lecturing, though much of the year 1868 he spent involuntarily in Ireland, in prison for debts owed to English creditors. Egotist to the last, he dictated <span class="italic">My Life in many States and Foreign Lands</span> in 1902 and died from heart failure on 19 January 1904 at Mills Hotel, New York, which the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent there, in the briefest of obituary dispatches, described as a cheap lodging-house.<br>
