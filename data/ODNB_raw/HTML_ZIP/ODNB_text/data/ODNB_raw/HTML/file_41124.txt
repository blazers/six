<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wood,  (John) Christopher <span class="st"> [Kit]</span></span>  (1901&#150;1930), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 7 April 1901 at Yalding Cottage, Knowsley, Lancashire, the first of the two children of Robert Lucius Wood (1870&#150;1960), a physician who practised on the earl of Derby's estate at Knowsley, and his wife, Clara Dolores, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Arthur (1869&#150;1946). The family lived in Huyton until 1926, when they moved to Broad Chalke, Wiltshire. Christopher Wood was educated at Holmwood School, Freshfield preparatory school (1908&#150;14), Marlborough College (1914&#150;15), Malvern College (1918), and Liverpool school of architecture (1919&#150;20). In 1915 an illness kept him at home for three years, leaving him with a permanent limp. He was apprenticed in 1920 to Thornley and Felix, dried fruit importers in London. He rented a room at 6 Oxford Terrace, Bayswater, and spent his spare time painting and socializing.<br>
<br>Through Robert Tritton, Wood met Alphonse Kahn, a wealthy homosexual art connoisseur and collector, and member of a banking family. Invited by Kahn, Wood arrived in Paris on 19 March 1921, to stay in his luxurious house at 41 avenue Bois de Boulogne. Kahn paid Wood's expenses and took him to museums, dealers, and studios. It was the start of a peripatetic life, usually based in his lovers' apartments, though Wood had a flat at 11 bis rue Balzac in 1921; rented rooms briefly in 1928 at 234 King's Road, Chelsea, London; then took a house nearby at 3 Minton Place, while maintaining a studio at 54 rue des Saints-P&egrave;res, Paris. He enrolled at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian and later attended La Grande Chaumi&egrave;re.<br>
<br>In the early summer of 1921 Wood met Antonio de Gandarillas (<i>b</i>. 1887), a Chilean roving diplomat. Fourteen years older than Wood and married, though homosexual, Gandarillas lived a glamorous life partly financed by gambling. Their relationship lasted through Wood's life, surviving his affairs with Jeanne Bourgoint and, probably, Jean Cocteau; his plans to marry Meraud Guinness in 1927, frustrated by her parents' opposition; and his final liaison with a Russian emigr&eacute;e, Frosca Munster, whom he met in 1928. His closest relationship was with his mother, the person whom he most wished to please and to whom he wrote thousands of letters. Wood was remote from his father, whom he identified with the middle-class banality of Huyton, which he loathed.<br>
<br>Insecure, compulsive, bisexual, and probably depressive, Wood craved both stability and the stimulus of emotional and physical excess. Gandarillas's chic social circle provided these conditions. Unwaveringly ambitious, Wood wrote to his mother in 1921 that he intended &#145;to try and be the greatest painter that has ever lived&#146;  (Ingleby, 59). He grasped at social status as a route to artistic success and, in return, charmed Parisian sophisticates with his handsome features, smart, conventional clothes, good manners, and astonishing na&iuml;vety, product of a secluded adolescence and a determinedly non-intellectual mindset. Yet the conflict between ambition and the life offered by Gandarillas became irreconcilable.<br>
<br>In 1922 Wood and Gandarillas established a pattern of leisurely travel interspersed with bouts of intense work. After touring the Netherlands they went to Monte Carlo, Nice, Marseilles, and north Africa, where Wood painted some unremarkable portraits and still lifes. He worked hard for two months in Taormina before visiting Malta, Greece, Constantinople, and Smyrna, a centre for drug distribution. It is not clear when he began to smoke opium though it was common practice in Gandarillas's circle. Both men were hospitalized with malaria in Smyrna; when they recovered they headed for Venice, northern Europe, then Gandarillas's house at 145 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London.<br>
<br>In 1923 Wood moved into Gandarillas's apartment at 60 avenue Montaigne, Paris, where they remained until early 1927 when they moved to a modern block at 6 rue des Marronniers. Financially and socially dependent, he benefited from Gandarillas's connections, which may have been how he met Picasso. Wood consistently avoided both artistic bohemia and fashionable society painters, aligning himself with modern, non-academic painting. In response to Picasso, whom he acknowledged as one of his primary models, he simplified his colour and imagery and began to draw statuesque nudes. Travelling with Gandarillas in the following year, Wood met Cocteau, whom he admired equally. In his own portrait drawings he adopted Cocteau's manner of drawing with a fluid line and almost no shading.<br>
<br>However, by the end of 1925 Wood wanted, he wrote, to make paintings &#145;full of English character&#146;  (Ingleby, 109). The opportunity came when he met Ben and Winifred Nicholson in the following year, initiating a relationship that was fundamental to his development. They introduced him to the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96398', "Seven & Five Society")</script>, of which he was a member from 1927 to 1929. Wood spent March and April 1928 with them at Bankshead, Cumberland. Here, unable to smoke opium, to which he was addicted, he worked intensively. In flower paintings and pared-down landscape drawings, the trio arrived at a viable, modern alternative to French sophistication.<br>
<br>In August or September, during a day's visit to St Ives, Wood and Ben Nicholson encountered Alfred Wallis, whose untutored simplicity became a model for such paintings as Wood's <span class="italic">Porthmeor Beach</span> (oil, 1928), one of his first fully individual works. Often using house paint in emulation of Wallis, he painted solid, simplified forms in rich, natural colour. He had already recognized the centrality of a childlike vision to modern art, but though his painting was often compared to children's art, its deliberate simplicity masked its real sophistication. Wood's modernity was achieved through representations of the rural that identified it with a spiritual quality located in simplicity and changelessness.<br>
<br>In April 1929 Wood showed thirty-three paintings at Arthur Tooth &amp; Sons, London, his one individual exhibition during his lifetime. That summer he worked first in Dieppe, painting fishing boats like <span class="italic">Boat in Harbour, Brittany</span> (oil on board, 1929; Tate collection) with meticulous attention to detail. Then, suffering severe financial problems caused by his worsening addiction, he moved to Douarnenez and Tr&eacute;boul, where he was emotionally supported by the poet Max Jacob.<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1929 Boris Kochno invited Wood to design scenery and costumes for an episode in C. B. Cochrane's 1930 <span class="italic">Revue</span>, to be performed by the fashionable Ballets Russes. The theme was the human &#145;freaks&#146; of the Luna Park circus. On 4 March 1930 Wood attended the well-received opening in Manchester. In May he showed with Ben Nicholson at the Galerie Barbazanges, in Paris. Ten paintings were bought by Lucy Wertheim, for whose London gallery Wood was to provide the opening exhibition in October. Under great pressure he returned to Tr&eacute;boul, where he produced forty paintings in six weeks. Some were based on postcards; most depicted simple buildings, religious ceremonies, and light-hearted local events.<br>
<br>These are the paintings on which Wood's reputation depends. He received little critical recognition during his life, though the memorial exhibition of 1938 at the New Burlington Galleries, London, brought him considerable posthumous attention. He was then almost forgotten until the 1970s, when the first of several critical re-examinations of his work took place. Today he is acknowledged for playing an essential if limited role in establishing links between modernity, landscape, and concepts of the &#145;primitive&#146;.<br>
<br>In Paris in July 1930 Wood made two somewhat surreal final paintings while stress steadily increased his addiction, led him further into debt, and made his behaviour ever less predictable. Deeply disturbed, he travelled to England on 19 August to finalize arrangements with Wertheim. Convinced that he was being followed and threatened, he diverged to the Isle of Wight. On 21 August he went to Salisbury, met his mother and sister Elizabeth (Betty), then jumped under the London-bound train at Salisbury station and was instantly killed. He was buried at All Saints' Church, Broad Chalke, on 23 August. Paintings by Wood are in many regional galleries, including Southampton Art Gallery; Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne; Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester; and Manchester City Galleries. The Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, the Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Quimper, and the Phillips Collection, Washington, DC, also hold examples of his work.<br>
