<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paget, Sir  Edward</span>  (1775&#150;1849), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, born on 3 November 1775, was fourth son of Henry Paget, first earl of Uxbridge of the second creation (1744&#150;1812), and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1817), eldest daughter of Arthur Champagne, dean of Clanmacnoise, Ireland. Edward entered the army on 23 March 1792 as cornet in the 1st lifeguards and through skill, connections, and family fortunes, he advanced rapidly up the ranks. On 1 December 1792 he became captain in the 54th foot, on 14 November 1793 major, and on 30 April 1794 lieutenant-colonel of the 28th foot at the age of eighteen. He served in Flanders and Holland until March 1795, when he was ordered with his regiment to Quiberon, recalled, and then ordered to the West Indies under Sir Ralph Abercromby. Twice driven back by storms, he finally landed at Portsmouth in January 1796, and in July went to Gibraltar, and, remaining on the Mediterranean station, was present on 14 February 1797 at the action off Cape St Vincent. On 1 January 1798 he was made colonel in the army and aide-de-camp to the king; the same year he was at the capture of Minorca, and in 1801 served through the Egyptian campaign, his regiment being in the reserve under Sir John Moore. He was in the actions of 8, 13, and 21 March 1801, and was severely wounded in the last; was present at the investment of Cairo and Alexandria, and was given as a hostage to the French army at Cairo until they embarked in July 1801. Having returned to England late in 1801, he was in October 1803 appointed brigadier-general on the staff at Fermoy in Ireland; on 2 July 1804 he returned to England, and was made major-general on 1 January 1805. He stayed at Eastbourne until October when he went with his regiment to Cuxhaven and Bremen, returning in February 1806. In June he was sent to the Mediterranean, and placed in command of the reserve in Sicily, returning in January 1808 with the part of the army which was under Sir John Moore. On 23 February he became colonel of the 80th foot, and in April accompanied Sir John Moore to Sweden in command of the reserve. On his return to England in June he was immediately ordered to Portugal, and placed by Sir Hugh Dalrymple in command of the advanced corps of his army. He soon rejoined Sir John Moore in Spain, where he was credited with commanding the reserves at Corunna in such a way as to ensure victory; for this he received a medal, and was appointed to the staff of the Peninsular army under Wellesley, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, and command of the left wing of the army. It was in the Peninsula that Paget earned a reputation for energy and decisiveness, as well as for being a strict disciplinarian. He conducted the advance from Coimbra to Porto, and on 12 May 1809, in the action before Porto, lost his right arm. After recuperating in Britain, during which time he was promoted to lieutenant-general (4 June 1811), Paget rejoined Wellesley as his second-in-command. In November 1812 Paget, accompanied only by his Spanish orderly, rode out from his headquarters to try to restore some order to British troops who were then retreating from Burgos. Paget was captured by a French cavalry patrol and held prisoner until 1814.<br>
<br>On 26 December 1815 Paget rejoined his old regiment, the 28th foot. On 31 October 1818 he was made captain of Cowes Castle, and in 1819 he readied himself for the office of commander-in-chief of Ireland, only to be informed at the last moment that the position had been given to Sir David Baird. On 4 November 1820 he received a commission as governor of Ceylon, and administered the colony uneventfully from August 1821 to March 1823. Meanwhile, on 3 January 1822, he had been appointed commander-in-chief of the forces in the East Indies, and took up his new duties as soon as he was relieved in Ceylon. Paget initially welcomed the posting to India on account of the very generous salaries paid by the East India Company. However, his tenure there gave him little pleasure as he soon became embroiled in several controversies. Ill health and a deep aversion to bureaucracy drove him out of Calcutta and he chose to spend much of his time touring cantonments in upper India. His presence was really needed in Calcutta where the British administration was coping with the demands of a difficult frontier war with Burma. His reputation was further battered by the controversy surrounding his brutal suppression of a mutiny in the Bengal army in 1824. Efforts by the East India Company to have him recalled were blocked by Wellington who, while publicly defending Paget's handling of the Barrackpore mutiny, privately criticized him for his cavalier attitude to his office. Paget became full general on 27 May 1825. He returned to England in 1825, and made Cowes Castle, on the Isle of Wight, his principal residence. Paget received the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword on 29 April 1812, and was made a GCB on 12 June of that year. He was governor of the Royal Military College from 25 March 1826 to 1837 and then a governor of Chelsea Hospital until 1849.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1805 Paget married Frances Bagot, fourth daughter of William, first Lord Bagot, who died in 1806 at the birth of her child <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21107/', "Francis Edward Paget")</script>. In 1815 he married Harriet Legge, (<i>d</i>. 1855), fourth daughter of the third earl of Dartmouth. They had eight children: Henry William, Patrick, Edward, Heneage, Frances Jane, Harriet, Charlotte-Louisa, and Mary Georgiana. Paget died on 13 May 1849 at Cowes Castle; after a private funeral he was buried on 21 May in the cemetery of Chelsea Hospital.<br>
