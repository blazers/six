<span class="headword">Cornwallis,  Thomas</span>  (1663&#150;1731), <span class="occ">commissioner of lotteries</span>, was born in Brome, Suffolk, on 31 July 1663, the fourth son of Charles, second Baron Cornwallis (1632&#150;1673), and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Playsted (<i>d</i>. 1669). The Cornwallis family had a long tradition of service to the royal household. In April 1676 Thomas and his elder brother William were admitted fellow-commoners of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Thomas left Cambridge without taking a degree and in January 1680 obtained a commission as ensign in the 1st foot guards. He was promoted captain in 1683, serving in Portsmouth in succession to his brother Frederick. Between 1685 and 1687 he captained a company of grenadiers in the regiment known as &#145;our Holland&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1710, when the system of parliamentary lotteries was reintroduced after a break of ten years, Cornwallis was appointed one of the managers and directors at a salary of &pound;200 p.a., and retained this position for the remainder of his life. The lottery was intended to raise &pound;150,000 by sales of &pound;10 tickets, the majority of which earned 5<i>s</i>. annually, the few winning tickets being worth up to &pound;1000 annually, for thirty-two years. Such was its popularity that two lotteries were run each year to 1714, when Jacobite troubles brought proceedings to a temporary halt. When they recommenced in 1719 Cornwallis's own annuity was raised to &pound;400, with an additional pension of &pound;100. The lottery was run erratically until 1726 when many of the tickets remained unsold and it then ceased until 1731.<br>
<br>Cornwallis was childless, though twice married, first to Jane, widow of Colonel Vernam, and second, on 18 April 1723, to Anne, daughter of Sir Hugh Owen and widow of John Barlow of Lawrenny, Pembrokeshire. He died at his home in St James Street, Westminster, on 29 December 1731. His widow died at Bath on 7 April 1732.<br>
