<span class="headword">Mayo,  Daniel</span>  (1672&#150;1733), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born probably at Kingston, Surrey, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18461/', "Richard Mayo (c.1630&#150;1695)")</script>, the ejected vicar of Kingston, and his wife, Jane Smyth (<i>d</i>. 1713). His father was the Presbyterian minister at Kingston, and Daniel was &#145;strongly inclined to the ministry from early youth, but was diverted from it, for some years, by the difficulties of the times&#146;  (Harris, 34&#150;5). His elder brother took orders in the Church of England, but Mayo maintained his father's Presbyterianism all his life. His early education was probably undertaken by his father. He obtained the degree of MA, probably from Glasgow, and finished his studies at the University of Leiden under Hermann Witsius. On his return he preached occasionally in and about London. He was appointed assistant minister at the Tothill Street meeting, Westminster, in 1696, but moved in 1698 to Kingston, where he became the pastor of the Presbyterian congregation formerly served by his father. He was married about this time to Honour, who outlived him.<br>
<br>The congregation increased greatly under Mayo's care, and he was a popular preacher. He kept a school for dissenters at which Philip Doddridge was a pupil from 1712 to 1715. In his <span class="italic">Sermons on the Education of Children</span>, Doddridge acknowledges with gratitude the excellent instruction he received from Mayo. Mayo's &#145;heart and soul was in his preaching which was practical and serious, with great gravity and warm affection&#146;  (Harris, 36). He was a lively conversationalist and was considered &#145;a minister of considerable talents and exerted them with great success, both from the pulpit and the press&#146;  (Wilson, 3.62). He was one of the group of scholars who continued Matthew Henry's <span class="italic">Exposition</span>, contributing the notes on <span class="roman">2 Corinthians</span> and <span class="roman">1 and 2 Thessalonians</span>.<br>
<br>Mayo candidated in 1714, on the death of Matthew Henry, for the important Presbyterian pulpit at Mare Street, Hackney, in competition with John Barker. Barker was appointed, but this caused a split in the congregation. The seceders built a new meeting-house for Mayo at the Gravel Pit, Hackney. He preached alternate weeks at Kingston and Hackney, with George Smith as his colleague in both places. He was a subscriber at the Salters' Hall debate in 1719 but is said later to have disowned his subscription. In 1723 he resigned from Hackney to become one of the two ministers at Silver Street meeting in London, where he remained until his death.<br>
<br>Mayo was recognized as one of the leading Presbyterians of his time, and his sermon <span class="italic">The Necessity of Regular Mission to the Ministry</span>, delivered at Chertsey in 1705, expressed its traditional principles by deploring a drift to radical thinking on the one hand and extreme Calvinism on the other. He affirmed the right to private judgment, which must be open to all. He died at Kingston on 13 June 1733, his son Daniel later succeeding him as minister at the church where he had followed his own father. Another son became a vicar in the established church, so the family split between the two denominations continued in succeeding generations.<br>
