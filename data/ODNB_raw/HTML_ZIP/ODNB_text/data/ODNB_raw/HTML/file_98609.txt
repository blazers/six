<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pimlott,  Steven Charles</span>  (1953&#150;2007), <span class="occ">opera and theatre director</span>, was born at 332 Wellington Road North, Stockport, Cheshire, on 18 April 1953, the younger child of Arthur Pimlott, a fire insurance assessor, and his wife, Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whittaker. At the time of his birth registration the family lived at 42 Preston Road, Levenshulme, Manchester. In 1955 they moved to Brooklands, a quiet residential area of Sale; and from 1964 Pimlott attended Manchester grammar school. He went to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, in 1971, and graduated three years later with a degree in English literature. His school years set the tone for much of his later work. A gifted adolescent actor excelling in middle-aged female roles&#151;his Mother Courage in Bertolt Brecht's play and what he described as a &#145;definitive&#146; Gertrude (aged twelve) in a school production of <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> were specially thrilling&#151;he also found time to indulge a love for the oboe, and lifelong obsessions with board games, rollercoasters, and the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. At Cambridge, as a member of a set that included his younger schoolfriend Nicholas Hytner, he added directing to this portfolio. Vivid university society stagings of <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> and <span class="italic">HMS Pinafore</span> demonstrated his talent, not for fashionable conceptual or intellectual readings, but for theatrical bravura and sensual immediacy.<br>
<br>In 1976 Pimlott became a staff producer at English National Opera, collaborating notably with the director John Copley, before joining the newly formed Opera North in 1978. Of his many Leeds productions <span class="italic">Nabucco</span> (1979), <span class="italic">Der Freisch&uuml;tz</span> (1980), and the British stage premi&egrave;re of Borodin's <span class="italic">Prince Igor</span> (1982) were representative in their darkly powerful mastery of theatrical effect. On the strength of this success Pimlott swiftly amassed a long list of operatic credits throughout Europe and beyond. A spectacular, bullring <span class="italic">Carmen</span> starring Maria Ewing at Earls Court (1989, revived with Jos&eacute; Carreras as Don Jos&eacute; in Tokyo and elsewhere) was the most monumental of these; the much revived production of <span class="italic">La Boh&egrave;me</span> for English National Opera (1993) captured perfectly the youthful high spirits of the piece, while charting the sadness at its heart. His sensuous, lucid <span class="italic">Coronation of Poppea</span> for the same company (2000) was another career highlight.<br>
<br>Yet Pimlott's honest admission of the directorial limitations proper to opera led him to spend increasing time in &#145;straight&#146; theatre, starting with a stint as associate director under Clare Venables at the Sheffield Crucible (1987&#150;8). Productions there of <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> and Botho Strauss's <span class="italic">The Park</span>, added to a spiritually luminous cycle of <span class="italic">The Mystery Plays</span> for the city of York (1988), marked him out as a rising star of the mainstream. About this time, too, his collaborations with the stage designers Tom Cairns and Stefanos Lazaridis led to a sea change in Pimlott's working method, away from minutely detailed pre-planning towards a more intuitive, organic approach.<br>
<br>Pimlott's National Theatre d&eacute;but with Stephen Sondheim's <span class="italic">Sunday in the Park with George</span> (1990, nominated for an Olivier award) and <span class="italic">The Miser</span> (1991) were less sure-footed than usual, but his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), latterly as associate director (1996&#150;2002), proved much more congenial, with new writing as well as classic revivals. A mordant <span class="italic">Richard III</span> (1995) and sexually graphic <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span> (1999) were memorable, his work in Stratford's more intimate spaces especially so. Working without the visual trappings available to the large auditorium freed him up as an &#145;actor's director&#146;, and <span class="italic">Richard II</span> (The Other Place, 2000, with Samuel West) was a milestone. This RSC period was capped by a <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (2001, again with West) bound by bleak searchlights from lowering watchtowers.<br>
<br>Pimlott's forays into commercial theatre were artistically as well as financially lucrative. He brought the same brilliance to the blockbusters <span class="italic">Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</span> (London 1991, Broadway 1993), <span class="italic">Doctor Dolittle</span> (1998), and <span class="italic">Bombay Dreams</span> (2002) as to his work in the subsidized sphere, admitting no contradiction between the two. For Pimlott, good theatre was good theatre, whether it came from Aeschylus or Agatha Christie&#151;another of his extramural passions.<br>
<br>Of his late projects, one in particular enjoyed signal artistic success. As part of a triumvirate (with Martin Duncan and Ruth Mackenzie) coming together to run the Chichester festival, reduced by 2003 to its nadir, Pimlott breathed some fresh life into the once great space with boldly spiritual productions of Shakespeare, Chekhov, and Gotthold Lessing's <span class="italic">Nathan the Wise</span> (2003), as well as introducing strong new writing and a wondrous staging of Bulgakov's novel <span class="italic">The Master and Margarita</span> (2004). Chichester's educational and rehearsal building was named after him following his death.<br>
<br>As a personal turning point, the most important of all Pimlott's productions was Paul Dukas's rarity <span class="italic">Ariane et Barbe-Bleue</span> (Krefeld, 1986), in which he directed the German soprano Daniela Christina Bechly (<i>b</i>. 1956), daughter of Adolf Friederich Bechly, whom he married at Holy Trinity, Clapham, on 27 July 1991. They had three children, one daughter preceded by two sons. Pimlott was appointed OBE in 2007, and died of lung cancer on 14 February that year, at his home, Old House, Old House Road, Great Horkesley, Essex. He was survived by his wife and their children. His gift for conveying the relish of the moment, whether in opera, drama, or the musical, marked him out as a rare theatrical magician of his time.<br>
