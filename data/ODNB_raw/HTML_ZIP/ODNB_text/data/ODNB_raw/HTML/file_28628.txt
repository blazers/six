<span class="headword">Walsingham, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1560/61&#150;1630), <span class="occ">literary patron</span>, was the third son of Sir Thomas Walsingham (1526&#150;1584) and Dorothy, daughter of Sir John Guildford of Benenden, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28622/', "Sir Edmund Walsingham (b. in or before 1480, d. 1550)")</script>, lieutenant of the Tower. In his youth Thomas was probably employed by his father's first cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28624/', "Sir Francis Walsingham")</script>, to gather intelligence of Catholic plots against the crown. In 1589 he inherited the manor of Scadbury, Chislehurst, Kent, from his elder brother Edmund.<br>
<br>In 1590 Thomas Watson dedicated a Latin eclogue, <span class="italic">Meliboeus</span>, on the death of Sir Francis Walsingham, to Thomas Walsingham where he is figured as Tityrus and the author, Corydon, speaks of him as &#145;sweet friend&#146;. At this time, Thomas had already become a close friend of Christopher Marlowe, for on 18 May 1593 the privy council instructed:<blockquote>Henry Maunder, one of the messengers of H. M. chamber to repair to the house of Mr. Thomas Walsingham in Kent, or to any other place where he shall understand Christopher Marlowe to be remaining, and to bring him to the court. (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1592&#150;3</i>, 244)</blockquote>On 1 June 1593 Marlowe was killed in a tavern at Deptford; Ingram Frizer, who was responsible for Marlowe's death, was ironically a servant of Thomas Walsingham. In 1598, when Edward Blunt published his edition of Marlowe's <span class="italic">Hero and Leander</span>, he dedicated it to Sir Thomas and the &#145;Preface&#146; speaks of Walsingham's close association with Marlowe:<blockquote>wee thinke not ourselves discharged of the duty we owe to our friend, when wee have brought the brethlesse bodie to the earth &hellip; the impression &hellip; of the man, that hath beene deare unto us, living an after life in our memory, there putteth us in mind of further obsequies due unto the deceased &hellip; knowing that in his life time you bestowed many kind favors.</blockquote>Walsingham was, apparently, one of the mourners present at Marlowe's funeral.<br>
<br>In 1596 Walsingham was appointed justice of the peace for the hundred of Rokesley and in the same year, when a second armada threatened, he, with others, was directed to take 1080 men to protect the chain strung across the River Medway for the defence of Rochester. By this time he had been knighted, and in the following year Elizabeth visited Scadbury, where she planted an oak. In the same year he was allowed to extend his estates to include the manor of Dartford. It was also in 1597 that Sir Thomas first became MP for Rochester; he served again in 1601 and 1603. His wife, Audrey Shelton (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of Sir Ralph Shelton of Shelton, Norfolk, was a favourite of the queen; both husband and wife gave and received many gifts to and from Elizabeth. In 1599 Thomas was granted the reversion of the keepership of the Great Park at Eltham. After the death of Elizabeth, Audrey Walsingham was one of the ladies sent to accompany James's queen, Anne of Denmark, to London. Initially the queen took a dislike to Audrey but James appointed Sir Thomas and his wife as keepers of the queen's wardrobe and, in 1604, granted Audrey a pension of &pound;200 per annum for life. The Walsinghams remained royal favourites and Audrey took part in the queen's many masques including Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Masque of Blackness</span> (1604/5).<br>
<br>In the early 1600s Walsingham had become a close friend of George Chapman, who in 1605 dedicated <span class="italic">All Fooles</span> to &#145;my long lov'd and Honourable friend Sir Thomas Walsingham&#146; and dedicated a sonnet to him in affectionate terms. Again the 1608 edition of <span class="italic">The Conspiracie and Tragedy of Charles Duke of Byron</span> is dedicated &#145;To My Honourable and Constant Friend &hellip; And to my much loved from his birth &hellip; his sonne&#146;. Since this son, also Thomas, was only eight in 1608 Chapman appears to have been on terms of intimate friendship with the whole family. Thomas died on 11 August 1630 at Chislehurst and was buried in the Scadbury chapel in St Nicholas's Church, Chislehurst; his wife, Audrey, predeceased him in 1624.<br>
