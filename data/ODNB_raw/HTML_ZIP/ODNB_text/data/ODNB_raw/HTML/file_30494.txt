<span class="headword">Atkinson, Sir  Edward Hale Tindal</span>  (1878&#150;1957), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born in Beckenham, Kent, on 19 September 1878, the only son of Henry Tindal Atkinson (<i>d</i>. 1918), county court judge, and his wife, Marion Amy Lewin. He was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was known to his friends as Tatters. He obtained a third in classical honour moderations (1899) and a second in modern history (1901). Atkinson's grandfather, father, and uncle were all members of the Middle Temple, to which, inevitably, he was called in 1902. He practised in chambers and joined the south-eastern circuit and the Hertfordshire and Essex sessions. The greater part of his work consisted of rating and local government cases and to a lesser degree taxation, fields in which he built up a substantial practice.<br>
<br>Atkinson was elected to the Bar Council in 1913 and served until 1921. His practice was interrupted by the war, when he enlisted in 1917 as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and was transferred as a captain to the Royal Air Force in 1918, being promoted major in 1919. He went to Paris as legal adviser to the air section of the British delegation at the peace conference and became British secretary to the International Air Commission. For his work he was appointed CBE and received the French L&eacute;gion d'honneur. On his return to his chambers in 1920 he soon re-established a successful practice. From 1928 to 1930 he was an additional member of the Bar Council and in 1929 he followed in his father's footsteps as a bencher of the Middle Temple, an unusual distinction for a junior. In the same year he was appointed the first recorder of Southend-on-Sea.<br>
<br>In March 1930 Atkinson was appointed director of public prosecutions, somewhat unexpectedly and very much to his own surprise. Invited to visit the Home Office to discuss &#145;a certain matter&#146;, he went convinced that he had made some fearful blunder as recorder; when it was suggested that he should become director he refused to believe it, walked out of the room, and had to be fetched back. Unlike his immediate predecessors, Sir Charles Mathews and Sir Archibald Bodkin, he had not established a reputation in criminal law, but J. R. Clynes, who appointed him, had taken careful advice and the choice proved to be a good one.<br>
<br>Once in the director's chair, Atkinson displayed his extraordinary grip of law. He was now called on to devote his days exclusively to the criminal law, in which his experience was limited. In addition, he knew none of his staff and few of the counsel engaged in that type of work. During his first two years he was haunted by the fear that he was not making a success of his appointment and he later described this period as the most unpleasant of his life. But he displayed greater knowledge of criminal law than was perhaps expected of him, and his doubts disappeared as his experience widened, particularly after he was appointed KCB in 1932. He also found that his administrative experience with the Ministry of Health, to which he had acted as a referee under the <span class="roman">National Health Insurance Act</span>, stood him in good stead. Soon he became involved in preparing possible wartime legislation. The defence regulations in use throughout the war, and immediately afterwards, were in no small measure the result of his advice. During the war he was deeply involved in many serious and important cases including, of course, all the spy cases. He expressed personal sympathy for enemy nationals who were caught, but had no patience with British subjects who assisted the enemy.<br>
<br>Atkinson was a modest man with a quiet sense of humour who treated his staff with a rather shy courtesy. He was an excellent example of a gentle man: he never lost his temper or raised his voice; he was polite and considerate; he was also extremely generous, without ever seeking credit for his beneficence. His outlook on life was essentially liberal; he adhered to high moral standards, while tolerating human frailty. He exercised his official powers with shrewdness and with caution, and was &#145;usually sound&#146; in his judgment as to which cases his department should take up, and how they should be conducted  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 27 Dec 1957). When Atkinson had time to consider a legal problem in detail he could write an opinion which was a masterpiece of clarity. But when he was expected to give a &#145;snap&#146; judgment he often had to alter it on reconsideration. He was most reluctant to express such an opinion unless specifically asked, and in that event his advice was sometimes at fault because of his uncertainty.<br>
<br>Atkinson retired in 1944 after a period in office that has been described as &#145;one of the least contentious in the history of the department&#146;  (Rozenberg, 25). The following year he was appointed chairman of the Central Price Regulation Committee, which was set up under the <span class="roman">Prices of Goods Act</span>, 1939, where his advice and experience on the enforcement of price control legislation were invaluable. Here again his shyness and reluctance to express anything other than a carefully considered opinion made his work in negotiating fair prices with trade associations more arduous than was necessary. He remained chairman of the committee until it was dissolved in April 1953.<br>
<br>In 1948 Atkinson exceeded the records of his father and grandfather and followed his uncle by becoming treasurer of his inn. He has the distinction&#151;with two other treasurers&#151;of having his initials carved in the stonework of the entrance of the Middle Temple hall to commemorate the fact that all three held office during the period of post-war restoration. A lifelong bachelor, he was often to be found at his club, the Athenaeum. He died at his home, Clifton Lodge, St Margaret's Drive, Isleworth, Middlesex, after an accident, on 26 December 1957.<br>
