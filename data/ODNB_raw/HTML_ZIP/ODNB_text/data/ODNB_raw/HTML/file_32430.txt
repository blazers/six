<span class="headword">Clarke,  Louis Colville Gray</span>  (1881&#150;1960), <span class="occ">art connoisseur and museum director</span>, was born in Croydon on 2 May 1881, tenth son and youngest of the fourteen children of Stephenson Clarke, coal factor, and his wife, Agnes Maria Bridger. He was schooled privately. He went up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to read the history tripos, graduating in 1903. The family fortune sufficed to provide an ample income even for its youngest member. As a rich undergraduate, Clarke travelled widely in Europe, forming the taste and developing the interests, aesthetic and scientific, which were to distinguish his life. A confirmed bachelor, with an initial bias towards anthropology and archaeology, he journeyed also to Central America, Mexico, Chile, and Peru in 1906; and he made in 1910 the first of two visits to Ethiopia.<br>
<br>On returning to London, where he had already begun to collect works of art, Clarke formed a lasting friendship with Augustus John, of whose slighter oils he bought a few and of whose best drawings he gradually acquired a considerable collection. He saw active service in the First World War, but his physique being unequal to the rigours of army life, he was quickly invalided out. In 1919 he matriculated as a mature candidate for the diploma in anthropology at Exeter College, Oxford, attracted by the opportunity to study under R. R. Marett, Arthur Thomson, and Henry Balfour. Guided by Balfour, his tutor in archaeology and technology, Clarke did valuable work as a volunteer in the Pitt Rivers Museum, of which he continued a lifelong benefactor.<br>
<br>In 1922 Clarke succeeded Baron Anatole von H&uuml;gel as curator of the university museum of archaeology and ethnology at Cambridge. The appointment, made, it is believed, at the instance of Sir William Ridgeway, Disney professor of archaeology, was somewhat unexpected, but was soon justified by the quality of Clarke's work both in the university and abroad. In 1923 he took part in important excavations at Kechipaun, New Mexico. Socially gifted, with a prodigious memory manifest in a welter of genealogical information, Clarke renewed in the 1920s friendships made in his youth with members of the senior Austro-Hungarian families, when he took part in digs at Toszey and elsewhere in Hungary. To the growth of what has become the faculty of archaeology and anthropology, Clarke made a notable contribution by methodically building up and rearranging the collections, by reconciling conflicting academic interests, and by financing much excavation abroad and other work in Cambridge. In 1929 he was elected a fellow of Trinity Hall, and he remained a much appreciated member of that high table. Easy manners and hospitable inclinations endeared him to a wide circle of every age and many nationalities.<br>
<br>In 1937, when Sir Sydney Cockerell retired after twenty-nine years as director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Clarke was chosen to succeed him. It was a measure of his gifts and experience in dealing with every kind of antiquity and work of art that he was able to settle rapidly in his new post. Under Cockerell the collections and buildings had been greatly extended; and the Fitzwilliam had gained through his idiosyncratic lead much of the atmosphere of a private mansion which, as a public building, became its mark. Clarke unfortunately had little time to impress his particular personal taste, one more eclectic than Cockerell's, upon the museum and its collections, before the onset of war in 1939 dictated the removal of its treasures to safer places. With what remained, supplemented by loans, he kept interest in the arts alive in Cambridge, arranging in the museum over forty wartime exhibitions. Himself the owner of precious maiolica, French porcelain, English eighteenth-century furniture and silver, European <i>objets de vertu</i>, paintings, and drawings (some of the latter collected by his brother Charles, who bequeathed them to him in 1935), he used the Fitzwilliam's scant purchase funds advantageously, during these years when prices were low, to enhance the collections. What he bought was notably supplemented by his own generosity and by the benefactions he obtained for the museum. Between 1937 and 1960 he presented more than 2700 works of art, including nearly 2000 choice engravings. When he retired in 1946 he was nominated honorary keeper of the prints, an appointment which, like his honorary keepership of the American collections in the museum of archaeology, he retained until his death at the Evelyn Nursing Home in Cambridge on 13 December 1960. The university had conferred upon him in 1959 an honorary LLD. He bequeathed the cream of his library and collections to the university, mainly for the benefit of the Fitzwilliam, including superb drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, Correggio, Parmigianino, and Rubens. His only obvious lapse in <i>connaissance</i> was to leave a portrait drawing of Charles I as by Van Dyck; but it is only a copy of an original in the Rijksmuseum. It was supposed that he saw in it a mirror of his own features. The long eighteenth-century table at which he loved to entertain, the mahogany of exceptionally handsome colour, is used by his successors in office and by the syndics for their meetings. His unique dog in Vincennes porcelain has been shifted from its velvet-lined kennel to a showcase.<br>
<br>Of slight build and birdlike speed of mind and pitch of utterance, as well as of bodily movement, Clarke possessed to an extraordinary degree intuitive understanding fortified by extensive knowledge of most kinds of art. He had neither the patience nor the methodical habit of thought, nor did he feel the need, to submit himself to the discipline of serious writing. He produced only a few short articles. He had the order of merit of Hungary, an honorary fellowship of the Society of Archaeological and Historical Arts of Hungary, and in London membership of the Society of Dilettanti.<br>
