<span class="headword">Hickey,  Diarmuid</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Antony]</span>  (1586&#150;1641), <span class="occ">Franciscan friar</span>, was born in the diocese of Killaloe in Thomond, Ireland. The O'Hickeys were hereditary physicians to the O'Briens of Thomond and lived on both sides of the Shannon estuary. Other details survive concerning his background. He used the name &#145;Dermitius Thadaei &hellip; filius&#146; showing that his father's name was Tadhg. His brother Cormac was archdeacon of Killaloe and prior of Inis Cathaigh (Scattery Island in the estuary), and he wrote to him in Irish in 1626 naming other family members, possibly seven other brothers and one sister: Turlough, Una, Tadhg, Brian, Conor, Richard, Andrew, and James; Cormac was then staying with Richard and his family at Dunmoylan in north Limerick. Antony Hickey was, on one occasion, listed among the Franciscans from Connaught, while Bonaventure Baron said he was &#145;Tuamensis&#146; meaning, perhaps, from the diocese of Tuam; Hickey had, in fact, lived near Tuam town. He himself said that he grew up with his cousin Malachy O'Queely, later archbishop of Tuam, who came from Drinagh, co. Clare.<br>
<br>Hickey studied in Paris with O'Queely. He attended the Irish College at Douai and, when twenty-one, joined the Irish Franciscans at the recently founded St Anthony's College, Louvain, on 1 November 1607, as one of the first novices there. He received orders up to the diaconate at Mechelen in March&#150;April 1609, and the priesthood on 6 March 1610. He attended the general chapter at Rome in 1612 as a respondent defending theological theses. He taught theology at St Anthony's, Louvain, was on the house council in 1616, and was <i>praeses</i> or acting superior in 1617. He taught philosophy at Aix-la-Chapelle and theology at Cologne for some part of the years 1617&#150;19, but was in Louvain in February 1618 when he signed an approbation for Aodh Mac Aingil's (Hugh MacCaughwell's) <span class="italic">Sg&aacute;th&aacute;n Shacramainte na hAithrighe</span>.<br>
<br>In 1619 Hickey was called to Rome to assist Luke Wadding, at the friary of San Pietro in Montorio, in his project of restoring the literary and historical glory of the Franciscan order. One of the best Irish theologians of his day, Hickey answered the attacks on the Franciscans that had appeared in the <span class="italic">Annales ecclesiastici</span>, volumes 13 and 14, of Abraham Bzovius OP, continuator of Baronius, published at Rome in 1616&#150;17. Hickey's lengthy response, <span class="italic">Nitela Franciscanae religionis</span>, was completed before January 1626, but not published until 1627, under the name Dermitius Thadaei. A few years later he and Wadding were faced with the hostility of Patrick Cahill and Paul Harris to the religious of Ireland. On 22 June 1625 he became the first lecturer at the newly opened St Isidore's College in Rome, and later became a consultor for Roman congregations concerned with the doctrine of the immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the revision of the Roman breviary, and the ritual of the Greek church. He was also an agent at Rome for some Irish ecclesiastics. He edited three volumes of the works of Angelo del Paz OFM (who had died in the friary at San Pietro in Montorio in 1596) with Wadding, who thought very highly of him, and edited volumes 9, 10, and 12, on <span class="italic">Quaestiones in lib. IV sententiarum</span>, for Wadding's edition of John Duns Scotus. He left manuscript commentaries on Scotus, on moral and ascetical theology, on the immaculate conception, and on the stigmata of St Catherine of Siena. When he was appointed definitor-general in 1639 he was described as a jubilate lector of Ireland and minister provincial of Scotland. He was a large and amiable man, a favourite conciliator, beloved by all including Pope Urban VIII, who lamented his death on 26 June 1641 at St Isidore's at the age of fifty-five: he had struck his ankle on a step and a fatal infection had set in. He was buried in St Isidore's, and Wadding wrote his epitaph.<br>
