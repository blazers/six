<span class="headword">Kennedy,  John Stodart</span>  (1912&#150;1993), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born in Titusville, Pennsylvania, USA, on 19 May 1912, the only son in the family of three children of James John Stodart Kennedy, an Anglo-Scottish engineer, and his American wife, Edith Roberts Lammers. His early childhood was unsettled&#151;his family lived in Hong Kong, Philadelphia, and Toronto&#151;and he attended six different schools. His father was a first-class handyman and imbued him with something of his mechanical ingenuity as well as with his disrespect for people like lawyers and stockbrokers who &#145;produced nothing&#146;. Both parents were deeply religious; Kennedy's teenage apostasy and later divorce gave them profound unhappiness.<br>
<br>Kennedy was unlike many entomologists: neither he nor any of his family had any particular interest in natural history. At school he &#145;never excelled at anything in particular, unless it was French, and keeping white mice, and [he] had a habit of wool-gathering&#146;  (unpublished autobiographical note). It was not until his last years at Westminster School that he discovered biology, with his enthusiasm fostered by his biology teacher George Pickering. He went on to study zoology at University College, London, where he was deeply influenced by his teachers: simultaneously attracted by the mechanistic approach of J. B. S. Haldane and G. P. Wells, and repelled by E. S. Russell's vitalist animal behaviour lectures. This was the period when his biological and political views both took shape. His politics were characterized by compassion, a concern for social justice, and anti-fascism, articulated for many years as support for the Communist Party. In 1936 he completed his MSc under the eminent physiologist Gottfried Fraenkel, a recent refugee from Hitler's Germany who introduced him to the study of insect behaviour that was to become a passion for the rest of his life. On 20 November the same year he married a fellow student, Dorothy Violet Bartholomew (<i>b</i>. 1908/9), daughter of Walter Bartholomew, general merchant; they had one son.<br>
<br>From 1934 to 1936 Kennedy worked as a locust investigator for the Imperial Institute of Entomology at the University of Birmingham, where he studied for his PhD under G. L. Gunn and B. P. Uvarov. In 1936&#150;7 he and Dorothy spent four months in Sudan doing fieldwork. Kennedy was intrigued by the mechanisms locusts used to steer a course towards a stimulus such as a bush, by the conditions of the environment that stimulated them to leave some locales yet remain in others, and by variation in the conditions of the locusts themselves that led to variation in their behaviour. These studies underpinned all his science thenceforth. They led to an understanding of how insects orient to visual and chemical stimuli, to factors underlying migration, to the importance of physiological state in affecting behavioural responses, and to a more general understanding of the causes that underlie the behaviour of insects and other animals. Rigorous experimentation for the interpretation of behaviour and precision in terminology were already his hallmarks. His work led to the award of a PhD in 1938, and to a succession of short-term posts, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (1937&#150;8), the Rockefeller Malaria Research Laboratory, Tirana, Albania (1938&#150;9), and the Wellcome Entomological Field Laboratories, Esher, Surrey (1939&#150;42).<br>
<br>In 1942 Kennedy was given a wartime assignment with the Middle East anti-locust unit and investigated the effectiveness of applying an insecticide to the winged locusts that were devastating food crops in Africa and the Middle East. Eventually he overcame the major logistical difficulties, only to find that it was generally an ineffective method of control. He continued his war work at the chemical defence experimental station, Porton Down (1944&#150;5). Porton Down was already expert at the dissemination of poison from the air. Kennedy helped adapt this expertise to killing disease-carrying mosquitoes as part of the preparation for allied attacks on Japanese-occupied positions. He discovered that the initial effect of DDT is to excite the insect so that it can fly off before receiving a lethal dose, a phenomenon now known to occur with many insecticides.<br>
<br>In 1946 Kennedy took up a research post in V. B. Wigglesworth's newly formed Agricultural Research Council unit of insect physiology in Cambridge, where he remained until 1967. Divorced from his first wife in 1946, he later met Dr Claude Jacqueline (Claudette) Bloch, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Raph&auml;el, a French biologist, at a conference. Widowed by the holocaust and herself recovering from three years in Auschwitz and other Nazi camps, she brought her ten-year-old son to live with them after they were married in Paris in 1950. They had two further children, a son and a daughter, and established a happy home whence warmth and hospitality were extended to a wide circle of friends and colleagues.<br>
<br>Throughout his period at Cambridge and for five years subsequently, Kennedy studied the behaviour of aphids, and in particular how their flight is related to their leaving and finding host plants. He brought to this work his knack for devising methods and apparatus that could give answers not possible with &#145;off-the-shelf&#146; equipment. Using a vertical wind tunnel which balanced the speed of the down draft against an aphid's rate of climb towards the light, he showed that the aphid responds primarily to the ultraviolet wavelengths of skylight while dispersing, and that its primary response then shifts to the wavelengths of light corresponding to leaves. Similar techniques enabled him to recognize that host-finding involves the integration of take-off, ascent, migration, descent, landing, probing, and reproduction behaviours. By cutting the stylets of a feeding aphid he confirmed that the turgor pressure of the plant provides a flow of sap to the insect&#151;and incidentally provided plant physiologists with a technique for directly assaying unadulterated plant phloem.<br>
<br>Kennedy realized that generalizations were possible between the behaviour of the aphids during their migratory phase and that of the locusts with which he had worked earlier. Migration could be distinguished by persistent locomotion which is continued even if the insect is presented with a stimulus such as a mate or host plant; the difference between migratory and &#145;trivial&#146; locomotion lay in the insect's threshold of responsiveness to these types of stimuli. Later Kennedy showed that this was part of an antagonistic system of behaviour: the longer an aphid's flight, the stronger its subsequent response to a leaf, and the stronger the response to the leaf, the stronger any subsequent flight.<br>
<br>When Wigglesworth retired in 1967, the Cambridge Agricultural Research Council unit was disbanded. T. R. E. Southwood then invited Kennedy and his colleague A. D. Lees to move to the department of zoology and applied entomology of Imperial College, where they established the Agricultural Research Council's insect physiology group at the Silwood Park field station. The title of professor of animal behaviour in the University of London was conferred on Kennedy in 1968, but he never really enjoyed the small number of lectures that fell to his lot.<br>
<br>At Silwood, Kennedy's research continued to blossom. In 1973 he returned to investigating insect orientation in flight. Using a large wind tunnel with a moving floor to represent changes in the ground pattern, he demonstrated that male moths tend to &#145;zig-zag&#146; up odour plumes (pheromones) released by a female, adjusting to the effect of wind drift by reference to the ground and changing their angle of turn according to changes in the strength of the odour. He tested the responses of moths to odour in the field using an ingenious system: pheromone and soap bubbles were released simultaneously from an old tower, allowing the researchers and their videotapes to &#145;see&#146; the direction of travel of the pheromone and relate it to the moths' flight. He was able to prove that, contrary to previous beliefs, moths did not find the pheromone source by moving up the concentration gradient; instead, the moths primarily track the wind, finding the pheromone within it. Together with his colleagues, Kennedy revolutionized biologists' understanding of the nature of moth orientation to odour sources, and the laboratory attracted visiting scientists from all over the world.<br>
<br>Kennedy continued his research at Silwood (as a senior research fellow and emeritus professor of Imperial College, London) past his retirement in 1977 until 1983, when Southwood, now head of the department of zoology at Oxford, invited him to join as a research associate. In Oxford his main work was his book <span class="italic">The New Anthropomorphism</span> (1992). In this, his scientific testament, he condemned the description of animal behaviour in teleological terms; this, he powerfully argued, obstructed clear analytical thought.<br>
<br>Kennedy was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1965. He was president of the Royal Entomological Society from 1967 to 1969, and was elected an honorary fellow in 1974 and awarded its Wigglesworth medal in 1985. He was awarded the gold medal of the Linnean Society in 1985. On 3 February 1993, while working at the zoology department in Oxford, and just after a discussion with a colleague, he suffered a brain haemorrhage. He died on 4 February at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. He was survived by his wife and stepson, and his own three children.<br>
