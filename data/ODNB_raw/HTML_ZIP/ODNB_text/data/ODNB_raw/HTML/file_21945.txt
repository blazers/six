<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  Hugh</span>, third duke of Northumberland  (1785&#150;1847), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born on 20 April 1785, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21944/', "Hugh Percy, second duke (1742&#150;1817)")</script>, and his second wife, Frances Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burrell (1779&#150;1820). He was educated at Eton College and at St John's College, Cambridge, obtaining an MA in 1805 and an LLD in 1809. A tory like his father, but of a more moderate variety, he was elected MP for Buckingham in August 1806 and for Westminster in October the same year, and in May 1807 won a contested election for the county of Northumberland and an uncontested election for Launceston, which he had represented since the previous November, and where the Percys exercised political patronage. He chose to sit for the former, and continued to do so until summoned to the Lords in 1812 as Baron Percy, during his father's lifetime. Percy rarely spoke: his most dramatic, and puzzling, Commons interventions came in 1807 when he first tried to turn the <span class="roman">Slave Trade Abolition Bill</span> into a <span class="roman">Slavery Abolition Bill</span> by moving an amendment to emancipate every black child born after 1 January 1810. After the <span class="roman">Slave Trade Abolition Bill</span> had been passed on 16 March 1807 he moved the next day to introduce a new bill for the gradual abolition of slavery itself through the freeing of all slave children born after a date to be fixed. He may have been an ardent, and impetuous, anti-slaver, as many supposed, but since his move was vehemently opposed by Wilberforce on the tactical grounds that the hostility provoked by pressing the larger measure of total abolition would endanger the chances in the Lords of the lesser measure of abolition of the slave trade, it is just as likely that Percy was indulging in a wrecking ploy. Certainly he was known as a high tory on the Catholic question, and there is no record that he ever spoke on slavery matters again after 1807. His subsequent parliamentary utterances were infrequent and illiberal. In 1819, as lord lieutenant of Northumberland, he strongly supported a bill to prohibit all drilling and training without a licence from a lord lieutenant, citing as fact an alarmist rumour that between the rivers Tyne and Wear there were 100,000 armed men ready to rise, including 16,000 armed colliers. In 1820 he took the government line in the Queen Caroline affair, denouncing her &#145;most indecent conduct&#146; and the &#145;adulterous intercourse between her and Bergami&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 1</span>, 6 Nov 1820, 1669); his next, and last, speech came in 1832, when he called for the protection of the rights of lords of manors in a bill intended to encourage the employment of agricultural labourers.<br>
<br>On 29 April 1817 at Northumberland House, London, Percy married Lady Charlotte Florentia Clive (<i>d</i>. 1866), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5696/', "Edward Clive, first earl of Powis")</script>, and granddaughter of Robert Clive, scarcely three months, as it turned out, before he succeeded to the dukedom. It was accounted a successful marriage. Greville thought the duke:<blockquote>a very good sort of man, with a very narrow understanding, an eternal talker, and a prodigious bore. The Duchess is a more sensible woman, and amiable and good humoured. He is supposed to be ruled in all things by her advice. (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 1.164)</blockquote>Mrs Arbuthnot agreed that &#145;she is excessively good humoured and has very popular manners&#146; and noted that &#145;he is as rich as Croesus, [and] fond of magnificence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot</span>, 2.231). He covered his wife with diamonds, but they had no children. An opportunity for public display of his opulence and extravagance came in 1825 when he went to Paris as special ambassador at the coronation of Charles X with a magnificent spread of costumes, liveries, and plate all provided at his own expense. Four years later this outfit came in handy when he was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland with instructions to give Dublin a semi-regal performance: a caravan carrying &pound;90,000 worth of the duke's plate from the Paris mission was seen passing through Staffordshire on its way to Dublin, escorted by a body of soldiers. The previous lord lieutenant, the marquess of Anglesey, was dismissed at the end of 1828 because he was deemed to have gone native in his warmth towards the Catholics, meeting both O'Connell and Lord Clancurry (who had been in the Tower for treason in 1798), and Northumberland was sent to be a firm and dignified governor, aloof from politics. Some contemporaries found it a surprising appointment, considering the duke's political inexperience, and his reputation as &#145;a stupid, prosing, man&#146; and &#145;an amazing bore&#146;  (ibid., 2.231, 241), and his strong anti-Catholic views. Nevertheless it was, in Peel's view, an inspired choice: when Northumberland resigned along with the Wellington government in November 1830 he described him as &#145;the best chief Governor who ever presided over her [Ireland's] affairs&#146;  (Gash, 654). In its obituary in 1847, however, <span class="italic">The Times</span> was lukewarm about his viceroyalty, remarking that &#145;he possessed neither the talent nor the energy to make himself thoroughly hated&#146;  (13 Feb 1847). The duke was stolidly unimaginative, rather than stupid&#151;a standing joke was that he gave a deputation of distressed weavers an order for a waistcoat&#151;but unthinking stolidity and unquestioning faith in the duke (Wellington) were exactly what was required in Dublin in 1829&#150;30 to see through the implementation of Catholic emancipation by its previous opponents without encouraging triumphalist behaviour on the part of the Catholic Association, which was suppressed.<br>
<br>No further public appointments came the duke's way after the Irish viceroyalty, and he retired to Northumberland, with seasonal visits to Northumberland House whose views onto the Thames he defended vigorously against various threats by railway speculators. He became a governor of King's College, London, in 1831, a trustee of the British Museum in 1834, high steward of Cambridge University also in 1834, and chancellor in 1840. He was not popular in Northumberland, where he was regarded as unfriendly, reactionary, and self-important, with some justification. He made continual encroachments on common rights, and he contrived the exclusion of the borough of Alnwick from the <span class="roman">Municipal Reform Act</span> of 1835. He persisted in regarding the coalminers, on whom a significant part of his wealth depended, as unruly, disaffected, and potentially rebellious, and was always ready to use force to break strikes; at the height of the 1844 miners' strike he warned the home secretary, Sir James Graham, that &#145;masses of people may be forwarded by Rail Road and Steamer to a given spot, far beyond the controul [<i>sic</i>] of the Civil Power&#146;  (Alnwick MSS, third duke's letter-book, August 1844). He spent quite freely on improving the comforts of Alnwick Castle, and while he discussed agricultural improvements with his commissioners (land agents) he never got round to carrying them out, but he supported many local charities. He wrote to Wellington, as master of Trinity House, about Grace Darling's part in rescuing nine people from the wreck of the steamship <i>Forfarshire</i> on Starket Rock, Farne Islands, within days of its happening in September 1838, and was fully appreciative of her heroism.<br>
<br>On 12 February 1847 Northumberland was found dead in his bed at Alnwick. <span class="italic">The Times</span> observed that &#145;of the House of Lords he was by no means a distinguished member&#146; and that &#145;he was a man whose intellect and attainments procured for him a very moderate degree of respect&#146;  (13 Feb 1847). Nevertheless, his death occasioned county-wide mourning, thousands went to his lying-in-state in Alnwick Castle, the road from Alnwick to Gateshead Station was lined almost throughout for his funeral procession, platforms of stations on the route to London were crowded with people to see the special funeral train pass, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey on 23 February with great pomp. He was succeeded by his brother Algernon, and his widow lived on a jointure of &pound;12,500 a year until her death in 1866.<br>
