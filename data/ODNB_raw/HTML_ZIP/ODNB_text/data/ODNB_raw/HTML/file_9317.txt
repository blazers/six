<span class="headword">Ferguson,  David</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1533, <em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister</span>, seems to have hailed from Dundee. As he was said to be sixty-five at his death in 1598, he is assumed to have been born in 1532 or 1533, though if he were indeed &#145;the auldest Minister that tyme in Scotland&#146; when he died  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 437), his date of birth may have been much earlier. A glover by trade, he seems to have been self-educated and did not acquire a university training, though he had sufficient knowledge of Latin to be appointed to an assembly committee in 1574 to revise Patrick Adamson's Latin verse paraphrase of the book of <span class="roman">Job</span>. An early reformer, he came to the attention of the authorities in 1558, when on 7 July he was summoned with others in Dundee&#151;a hotbed of protestantism&#151;to answer charges of misusing the scriptures, disputing on erroneous opinions, and eating meat in Lent and at other forbidden times. On his own testimony he was one of six who preached the message of the Reformation without the support of the civil magistrate and when stipends were unknown.<br>
<br>By July 1560 Ferguson had become minister of Dunfermline; he attended the general assembly of December 1560 and was regularly present at assemblies until his death in 1598. Twice elected moderator, he presided over the general assemblies which met in Edinburgh in March 1573 and October 1578. Archbishop Spottiswoode's assessment of Ferguson as &#145;a good preacher, wise, and of a jocund and pleasant disposition, which made him well regarded both in the court and country&#146; is supported by Calderwood (Spottiswoode, 3.77; Calderwood, 5.435). He received a stipend of &pound;40 when the earl of Arran gained control of the revenues of Dunfermline Abbey at the Reformation, and in 1562 he was assigned a stipend which also took account of labours in 1561. By 1563, when his ministry extended to the care of the neighbouring parishes of Carnock and Rosyth, his stipend was &pound;160.<br>
<br>Soon after his entry to the ministry Ferguson married Isobel Durham, with whom he had five sons and four daughters: Margaret, baptized on 31 May 1562, who married David Spens, minister of Kirkcaldy, on 18 June 1581; his eldest son, William, baptized on 10 September 1564, who was a physician in Dundee and who died on 25 March 1627; Patrick, baptized on 23 June 1566; Robert, baptized on 3 October 1568; Janet, baptized on 24 September 1570, who married David Ramsay in April 1598; David, baptized on 21 January 1573; John, baptized on 19 May 1574; Grisel, baptized on 15 February 1576, who married John Row, minister at Carnock, in 1595; and Isobel, baptized on 24 February 1580.<br>
<br>Responding to an attack on Knox and the reformers by Ren&eacute; Beno&icirc;t, French chaplain to Mary, queen of Scots, Ferguson produced <span class="italic">Ane Answer to ane Epistle Written by Renat Benedict</span>, dated at Dunfermline 26 April 1562 and printed in Edinburgh by Robert Lekprevik in 1563, in which Ferguson refuted the accusation that the reformers had sought &#145;the favor of the people&#146; by showing how reformed practice subjected all who erred, regardless of status, to ecclesiastical discipline: &#145;where the Magistrat is godly we procure at his hand the punishment of whoredome, dronkennes, blasphemie, Idolatrie, morther, thift, and all other vices as the worde of God prescribes&#146;; and &#145;where their is no Magistrat that obeyth the voice of God &hellip; we use to expell such persones as are above written, by excommunicatioun out of our Congregations and from the communion of the faithfull&#146;  (Ferguson, 9&#150;10). Far from amassing wealth, as Beno&icirc;t alleged, most ministers &#145;lived in great penurie, without all stipend&#146; for many months, sustained by friends and borrowing from &#145;cheritable persones&#146;  (ibid., 10&#150;11). In matters of faith Ferguson reiterated how certainty of salvation proceeds by the mere mercy of God alone and that there is no obligation to believe one jot of general councils; the Lord who is present to the end of the world is not enclosed in a bit of conjured bread; there is no transubstantiation; by partaking of bread and wine by the mouth, believers partake of Christ's body by faith; images are forbidden by God; the early fathers ought not to be followed farther than they follow Christ; the mass is idolatrous, for bread and wine are worshipped, which makes Christ's sacrifice insufficient; the priest spoils Christ of his dignity, taking upon him the office of Christ but standing with his back to the people and speaking to the wall.<br>
<br>In January 1572 Ferguson preached a sermon in the kirk of Leith before Regent Mar and the nobility at the time of the convention of Leith, in which he protested at the secularization of the church's patrimony for private profit to the detriment of the ministry, schools, and the needy. The outcome was a compromise between crown and church on ecclesiastical endowment. Ferguson's evidently influential sermon was approved for publication in the general assembly which met at Perth in August 1572 by John Douglas, archbishop of St Andrews; John Erskine of Dun, superintendent of Forfarshire; John Winram, superintendent of Fife; William Christison, minister of Dundee; and John Knox. It was duly printed at St Andrews by Lekprevik in the same year. Ferguson participated in the production of the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span> (1578); was selected with others to petition the king in 1582 about the duke of Lennox's support for Robert Montgomery as archbishop of Glasgow after the assembly had approved the latter's excommunication; and in 1583 was appointed to an assembly commission for censuring bishops. In 1591 he witnessed Archbishop Patrick Adamson's recantation and submission to the church. When the synod of Fife in 1598 debated ecclesiastical representation in parliament in the light of the act of parliament in 1597 creating &#145;parliamentary bishops&#146;, David Ferguson was described as:<blockquote>the auldest Minister that tyme in Scotland, [who] spak gravlie, cleirlie, and at lainthe, whow the corruptiones of that office of Bischopes haid bein espyed be the Kirk of Scotland from the begining; what pean haid bein taken bathe in doctrin from pulpites and in Assemblies, for purging and allutterlie putting away thairof. And now he perceavit a purpose till erect tham of new, conveyed in sic a maner as he could compear to na thing better nor that quhilk the Grecians usit for the overthraw of the antient citie and kingdome of Troy. (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary of &hellip; Melvill</span>, 437)</blockquote>When James VI, who enjoyed debating with Ferguson, asked him &#145;why may I not have Bishops here in Scotland als well as they have in Ingland?&#146;, the response was:<blockquote>Yes, Sir, ye may have Bishops here, but ye must remember to make us all equall; make us all Bishops, els will ye never content us: for if ye sett up ten or twelve louns over honest men's heads (for honest men will not have your antichristian Prelacie), to knock us doune, and give them in rent more thousands (to debosh and mispend) nor honest men has hundreds or scores, we will never al be content. We are all Paull's bishops, Christ's bishops; hold us as we are. (Row, 419)</blockquote>Shortly before his death Ferguson foretold that &#145;if our King get Ingland (as I think he will) I am persuaded that he will erect Bishops in this Kirk also, and then adieu with the welfair both of this Kirk and policie of ours&#146;  (ibid.). Ferguson died on 23 April 1598, leaving an estate of &pound;516, including an English and a Latin <span class="roman">Bible</span>, &#145;his buikis of theologie and humane histories&#146; and &#145;his Scottis cronicle&#146;, estimated at &pound;100  (Ferguson, xxv&#150;xxviii). He also left a collection of more than 900 Scottish proverbs, first published in 1641.<br>
