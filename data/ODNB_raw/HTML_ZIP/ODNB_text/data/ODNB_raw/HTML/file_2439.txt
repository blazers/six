<span class="headword">Birchensha,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1605&#150;1681?), <span class="occ">musical theorist and teacher</span>, was  (according to Flood, 214) a son of Sir Ralph Birchensha (<i>c</i>.1565?&#150;1622?) and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. after 1618). They were possibly the Raphe Byrkenshaw and Elizabeth Morall who were married at Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 15 September 1586. Ralph Birchensha was sent to Ireland by the government in 1598 as controller of musters. After his death John, whom Anthony Wood described as &#145;a gentile man&#146;, remained in Ireland in the household of George FitzGerald, sixteenth earl of Kildare, until the rising of 1641  (Wood, fol. 19). In Playford's <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span> (1651, sig. A4) he was listed as a viol teacher in London, though it was as an instructor of the fundamentals of composition that he won renown. Birchensha claimed in a letter to the Royal Society of London that by following his rules &#145;not only those, who skilfully can sing or play on some Instrument, may learn to compose but also those, who can neither sing nor play&#146;  (26 April 1664, Royal Society, letter book copy, 1.166&#150;73). The clearest exposition of these rules is to be found in an autograph manuscript, Brussels, Biblioth&egrave;que Royale Albert Ier, MS II 4168 (<i>olim</i> 6689). To Evelyn they represented &#145;a mathematical way of composure very extraordinary: True as to the exact rules of art, but without much harmonie&#146;  (Evelyn, 3 Aug 1664). Pepys took a course of lessons from him which ended &#145;in a pet&#146; when Pepys dared to criticize the rules  (Pepys, 27 Feb 1662). Captain Silas Taylor, who brought Birchensha's ideas to the attention of the Royal Society, was a more enthusiastic follower. Thomas Salmon studied with him, on Matthew Locke's recommendation; Birchensha later wrote a preface to Salmon's <span class="italic">Essay to the Advancement of Musick</span> (1672). A jesting allusion to his method occurs in Thomas Shadwell's <span class="italic">The Humorists</span> (1671): &#145;Berkenshaw is a rare fellow, give him his due, fa la la, for he can teach men to compose that are deaf, dumb, and blind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Complete Works of Thomas Shadwell</span>, 1.221).<br>
<br>Birchensha gained a reputation as a savant in matters pertaining to harmonic proportion and tuning. Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of the Royal Society, described him as &#145;in Musica tum theoretica tum practica apprime versatus&#146; (&#145;very experienced both in theoretical and in practical music&#146;; <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 7 June 1673). William Brouncker, Nicolaus Mercator, John Pell, and John Wallis were among the mathematicians who examined his propositions  (Gouk, 61, 188). In 1662 the first of several papers from him was presented to the Royal Society, and meetings of the society on 3 and 10 August 1664 were followed by concerts of instrumental music by him, one of which was attended by Evelyn and the other by Pepys. In 1664 he published his <span class="italic">Templum musicum</span>, a translation of part of J. H. Alsted's <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia</span>. Though never elected a fellow, he was invited on 10 February 1676 to demonstrate to the Royal Society his &#145;compleat Scale of Musick&#146;, a chart displaying &#145;all consonant and dissonant intervals suitable to musical Harmony&#146; with their ratios in Pythagorean intonation; this was likely another version of &#145;his great Card of the body of Musique&#146; which Pepys had been shown on 24 February 1662 at Birchensha's house in Southwark. His most substantial surviving theoretical work is an unpublished &#145;Compendious discourse of the principles of the practicall &amp; mathematicall partes of musick&#146; which he wrote for Robert Boyle, the brother-in-law of his former patron the earl of Kildare  (autograph manuscript, Royal Society, Boyle papers, 41.1). He worked for years on a treatise, &#145;Syntagma musicae&#146;, which was to have summed up his ideas about the philosophical, mathematical, and practical aspects of music; subscriptions were invited in 1672, and a detailed synopsis was read to the Royal Society on 10 February 1676  (Royal Society, classified papers, XXII.(1).7), but the book itself never appeared.<br>
<br>Birchensha's importance rests on his certainty, extraordinary among professional musicians, that nearly every aspect of music could be rationalized. He has been described, unjustly, as a quack; but his failure to publish &#145;Syntagma musicae&#146; restricted his influence as a theorist, and his compositions, which include psalm settings and instrumental suites, seem clumsy and charmless when set beside the best English work of the period. He was almost certainly the John Birchenshaw buried in Westminster Abbey cloisters on 14 May 1681.<br>
