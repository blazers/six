<span class="headword">Southern,  Henry</span>  (1799&#150;1853), <span class="occ">journalist and diplomatist</span>, was born at York, the son of Richard Southern, a barber. After attending school in York he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a sizar on 31 December 1814, graduated BA in 1819 as twenty-second senior optime, and proceeded MA in 1822. On 23 January 1822 he became a member of the Middle Temple, but he was not called to the bar. Meanwhile, he had founded the <span class="italic">Retrospective Review</span>, whose first number appeared in January 1820. Dedicated to the promotion of early English literature, most particularly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the <span class="italic">Review</span> provided &#145;valuable criticisms upon, analyses of, and extracts from curious, valuable, and scarce old books&#146;  (Introduction, <span class="italic">Retrospective Review</span> 1, 1820). Southern wrote a good deal of the material himself but also managed to recruit a number of talented, and often young, contributors, including Charles Wentworth Dilke, Thomas Noon Talfourd, the Unitarian William Johnson Fox, John Hamilton Reynolds, and Charles Barker, a friend from Trinity College (and possibly a schoolfellow), who acted as his assistant. Southern was sole editor of the <span class="italic">Review</span> until 1826, when the antiquary Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas became his partner. The magazine folded in 1828.<br>
<br>By this time, however, Southern had been associated with other journals. When Jeremy Bentham founded the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span> in 1824, he invited him to take charge of its literary pages alongside John Bowring, who was the political editor. Charles Barker again agreed to share Southern's duties. By now a confirmed Benthamite and a Unitarian, Southern took a distinctly utilitarian view of contemporary literature, tending to dismiss much of it as irrational, sentimental, and anti-progressive. He especially denigrated fashionable novels and light verse. Nevertheless, he impressed many, including Henry Crabb Robinson who was struck early on by his &#145;talent and learning&#146;. The two became friends, though it was not an entirely happy relationship, Crabb Robinson often complaining in his diary of Southern's insobriety (which Francis Place also noticed) and his habit of not paying his debts. His friend's unwillingness to pay him for contributions to the <span class="italic">Westminster</span>, added to Southern's attack in its pages on Crabb Robinson's friend Ayrton, led to a final break. Crabb Robinson declared in exasperation that Southern had become a &#145;fanatic of reform&#146; and an &#145;iconoclast&#146;. Southern relinquished his role as co-editor of the <span class="italic">Westminster</span> in 1827, though he continued to write for it.<br>
<br>For nearly three years Southern had been associated with the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span>, first as associate editor, then from January 1825 as the editor of a new series. He took over the ownership of the magazine in the following September. Under its new proprietor the once celebrated <span class="italic">London</span>, which had been steadily losing readers, went into an even steeper decline principally because Southern used it as a medium for the social and political concerns of utilitarianism, rather than for promoting the best of contemporary literature. To Charles Lamb, Southern's February number of 1825 was &#145;all trash&#146;. By the following August, when Lamb's final article appeared, the <span class="italic">London</span> had &#145;fallen&#146;. A drastic loss of readers necessitated Southern's sale of the magazine to Charles Knight in April 1828, by which time he was busily employed as a freelance. He contributed to early issues of <span class="italic">The Atlas</span> newspaper and wrote on literature for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> at a reported &pound;5 a week under the sobriquet of O'Higgins, after the former dictator of Chile.<br>
<br>From September 1828 Southern was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span>, where he evinced a special interest in French politics and literature, and also in the reform of education and prison discipline. He embraced Jean-Joseph Jacotot's system of education which was critical of &#145;mechanical&#146; learning. He also promoted the American system of prison discipline that relied on solitary, rather than communal, detention, and he approved of the American privatization of prisons. Southern was an opponent of transportation to Australia and forced labour, and he frequently held up Bentham's Panopticon scheme as an ideal. His tastes at this time were &#145;most miscellaneous&#146;, according to a letter he wrote to Macvey Napier, editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, to whom he offered an article on Aboriginal life in Australia and an account of the Belgian communes. His interest in foreign politics had already been reflected in his freelance contributions to the <span class="italic">Westminster</span> and when, in August 1830, revolution broke out in Belgium he lost no time in visiting Brussels, talking to politicians and reporting on the trial of De Potter. He later published graphic accounts of his experiences in the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span>, <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Westminster</span>. At this time Southern was also writing for the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, the <span class="italic">United Service Journal</span>, and, like many of his fellow utilitarians, for the radical <span class="italic">Examiner</span>.<br>
<br>In 1833 Southern's former colleague on the <span class="italic">Westminster</span>, John Bowring, recommended him to Sir George Villiers, ambassador to Spain, as his private secretary. Southern duly accompanied Villiers to Madrid and by the following year had been promoted at the minister's request to an unpaid post as attach&eacute; to the legation. He was made paid attach&eacute; in August 1835 when his predecessor, Newton Savile Scott, moved to The Hague. Villiers regarded Southern as his &#145;right-hand man&#146; and thanked Palmerston for giving him an attach&eacute; with &#145;worth and abilities &hellip; of no ordinary kind&#146;  (Bullen and Strong, 281). He proved invaluable in helping Villiers draw up a trade treaty, and his close contacts with the Spanish, particularly the liberals, enabled him to handle the Cadiz junta effectively in 1836. An attack on Southern in the <span class="italic">Journal des D&eacute;bats</span> of 1 September 1837 alleged that he had taken part in the military insurrection which had made the queen a prisoner, but this was publicly scotched by Villiers and Southern. In April 1838 Southern's intervention on behalf of the gaoled George Borrow contributed to his early release. By 1839 Southern was looking for a post outside diplomacy and Villiers arranged for him to be proposed for the governorship of Mauritius, which had to be taken up immediately. Unfortunately, the resignation of Villiers soon afterwards demanded that Southern, as his deputy, remain behind in Madrid, and the governorship went to another.<br>
<br>With the arrival of a replacement for Villiers, Southern was appointed secretary of the legation at Lisbon in the autumn of 1839. Here too he felt unfulfilled, and by February 1842 was seeking more active employment from Aberdeen. In the following May he wrote again to Aberdeen requesting to be reconsidered for the vacant governorship of Mauritius, as the &#145;great object&#146; of his ambition was to have &#145;the political management and administration of a Colony&#146;  (Southern to Aberdeen, BL, Add. MS 43229, fol. 141), but was again unsuccessful. He was an assiduous secretary and ensured that his former master Villiers was kept informed of events in Portugal and elsewhere. One report of forty-four pages on the September 1843 conclave at Ch&acirc;teau d'Eu was based on a confidential communication from Aberdeen himself. During the civil war of 1846&#150;7 in Portugal, Southern's strong sympathy for the Septembrists (in opposition to Howard de Walden's equally fervent support for Queen Isabella) prompted Palmerston to reassure the governments of Spain and France that the Septembrists were not Miguelites. On 31 May 1848 Southern was appointed minister to the Argentine confederation and on 29 August 1851 was promoted to the court of Brazil, having been made a companion of the Bath in the previous March. He died a bachelor on 28 January 1853 at Rio de Janeiro.<br>
