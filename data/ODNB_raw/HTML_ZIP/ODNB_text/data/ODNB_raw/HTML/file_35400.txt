<span class="headword">Parsons,  Richard Godfrey</span>  (1882&#150;1948), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was born at Pendleton, Lancashire, on 12 November 1882, the only son of William Parsons, merchant, of Calcutta, who became secretary of the Bengal chamber of commerce, and his wife, Bertha Best, of Thetford, Norfolk. Educated at Durham School (1895&#150;1901), he became in 1901 a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, obtaining in 1903 a second class in honour moderations and in 1905 and 1906 first-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i> and theology, and being elected to a Liddon studentship. Postgraduate work in Germany was followed by residence at the deanery, Westminster, as the pupil of the dean, J. Armitage Robinson, and at Cuddesdon College.<br>
<br>Ordained deacon and priest at London in 1907, with a curacy at Hampstead parish church, Parsons returned to Oxford the same year as fellow, praelector, and chaplain of University College. There he showed the combination of his intellectual command of theological matters and his desire for reform, and he &#145;dabbled with modernism&#146;  (Stephenson, 89). In 1911 he was made principal of Wells Theological College, and in 1912 was associated with B. H. Streeter, William Temple, and others in the publication of <span class="italic">Foundations</span>, a book on liberal theology which at the time made a considerable stir, and in which Parsons was one of the joint authors of an essay, &#145;The interpretation of the Christ in the New Testament&#146;. In 1912 he married Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1953), only daughter of Francis Gales Streeter, of Littlehampton, Sussex. They had two sons, the elder of whom died of wounds in Egypt in 1942.<br>
<br>The war had by 1916 practically emptied the college at Wells, and in 1916&#150;17 Parsons served as a temporary chaplain to the forces in London. In 1916 he became vicar of Poynton, Cheshire, and in 1919 rector of Birch in Rusholme, near Manchester. He combined with his parish activities teaching and organizing work for the University of Manchester, in which in 1929 he became dean of the faculty of theology. He had in 1924 taken the degree of DD at Oxford. In collaboration with A. S. Peake he prepared for publication and saw through the press the English edition of <span class="italic">An Outline of Christianity</span> (1926), a work in five volumes originally planned and produced in America.<br>
<br>Consecrated in 1927 as suffragan bishop of Middleton, Parsons combined this with his other commitments until 1931, when he became residentiary canon and subdean of Manchester. In 1932 Parsons became bishop of Southwark, one of the heaviest and most arduous dioceses in England. Although intellectually extremely able, he had his greatest satisfaction perhaps as a &#145;grass-roots&#146; churchman given to working for the needy of a parish rather than to great oratory. This came to the fore in his new south London diocese, with large numbers of the poorer working class, and particularly during the winter of 1940 when the diocese suffered heavy bombardment from the air. Parsons's efforts and the strain of this time told on his health. He became bishop of Hereford in 1941. There he remained, and contributed more broadly to church matters, particularly in the immediate post-war years. He paid visits to Romania and Yugoslavia; he acted as chairman in 1947 of an inter-church conference between theologians of the Anglican church and theologians from Denmark and Iceland. He was described in his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> as &#145;no merely academic scholar, but a man of wide outlook in public affairs and with a lively interest in housing and kindred social questions&#146;. He also had a &#145;passionate&#146; desire to see Christianity applied to corporate, and state, conduct. He was made an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, in 1942 and an honorary DD of the John Hus faculty at Prague in 1946. He died at the General Hospital, Hereford, on 26 December 1948 and was cremated at Cheltenham on 30 December.<br>
