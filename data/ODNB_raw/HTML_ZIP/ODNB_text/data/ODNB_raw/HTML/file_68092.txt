<span class="headword">Major,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1656), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was the author of a single volume, entitled <span class="italic">Honey on the rod, or, A comfortable contemplation for one in affliction; with sundry poems on several subjects</span> (1656).<br>
<br>Major's identity is unknown, and there is little to be done but quote from her preface to the second part of <span class="italic">Honey on the Rod</span>:<blockquote>I was, till the fifteenth or sixteenth year of my age, brought up by a godly and careful Father (my Mother being taken from me in my infancy) from whom I went to a great and honorable Family, where no vice I think was tolerated; and under a wise and vertuous Governness I lived nere ten years, til God was pleased to visit me with Lameness &hellip; Then I was forc't to repair home to my Father again, where I was persued with an inordinate desire of recovery; and having some money in my own hands, I endeavored the accomplishing of that desire, without an humble and obedient submission to the will of God &hellip;<br>
<br>&hellip; upon serious consideration I saw my folly, and found that I had lost much time, in which I had offended God, and deprived my self of that little health I enjoyed, spent my money, and onely gaining a sight and knowledge of those things, I humbly desire my soul may ever abhor; therefore I had no rest in me, till I had shewed my indignation against what so much offended me. (Major, unpaginated prefatory page)</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Honey on the Rod</span> was published under the imprimatur of Joseph Caryl, the leading nonconformist divine and rector of St Magnus, London, during the civil wars and interregnum. Caryl's three-page prefatory recommendation of the volume has led to speculation that Major was a parishioner and prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of Caryl. Caryl's role as licenser for printing books of divinity from 14 June 1643, however, is enough to explain his involvement in the publication, and there is no evidence that he knew Major personally. Major is likely to have dwelt in London, and it is possible that she was, as some have speculated, the daughter of John Major and Mary Allton of Blackfriars, in which case she was born about 1628.<br>
<br>Major's volume consists of meditations in prose, largely constructed as dialogues between Consolation and the Soul; verses which explore the sins of pride, drunkenness, covetousness, prodigality, and of profaning the sabbath and the name of God; and several acrostics based on her name. Major styles her volume as a child sent forth into the world, and she writes &#145;onely this may cause some trouble in me, I think it will finde none of so low a birth as it self&#146;  (Major, unpaginated prefatory page).<br>
