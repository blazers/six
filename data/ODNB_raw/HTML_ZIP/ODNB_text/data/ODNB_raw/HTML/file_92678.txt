<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thesiger, Sir  Wilfred Patrick</span>  (1910&#150;2003), <span class="occ">explorer</span>, was born on 3 June 1910 at the British legation, Addis Ababa, Abyssinia, the eldest of four sons of Captain Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger (1871&#150;1920), British consul-general and minister-plenipotentiary in Addis Ababa, and his wife, Kathleen Mary (1880&#150;1973), elder daughter of Thomas Mercer Cliffe Vigors, of Burgage, co. Carlow. His father was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36464/', "Frederic Augustus Thesiger, second Baron Chelmsford")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandtravels"></a>Early life and travels</h2>As a small boy Thesiger watched his father shoot big game in Abyssinia, and in India where Captain Thesiger's eldest brother, Frederic Thesiger, third Baron Chelmsford, was viceroy. At Addis Ababa he saw white-robed priests dance at Epiphany before the ark of the covenant; and a wildly thrilling victory parade on the field of Jan Meda, after the decisive battle of Sagale, which ended the revolution in 1916. Such memorable experiences in early childhood gave Thesiger his craving for adventure, &#145;savagery and colour&#146;  (Maitland, 45), which he later maintained had influenced the whole of his life.<br>
<br>After he returned, aged eight, with his family to England in 1919, Thesiger was educated at St Aubyn's preparatory school, Rottingdean, Sussex (1919&#150;23), and then at Eton College (1923&#150;8) and Oxford (1929&#150;33). When his father died in 1920 Thesiger's mother moved from Brighton to a farmhouse in Herefordshire, and from there to The Milebrook, Radnorshire, which remained the family's home from 1921 until 1942. She remarried in October 1931. Her second husband, Reginald Basil Astley, a 69-year-old widower, died in 1942.<br>
<br>In November 1930, as honorary attach&eacute; to the duke of Gloucester, Thesiger attended the Abyssinian emperor Haile Selassie's coronation in Addis Ababa. After the ceremonies he hunted big game for a month along the Awash River, whose unmapped exit he became determined to discover. He boxed for Oxford from 1930 to 1933 and captained the university side in his final year. In 1933 he left Magdalen College with a third-class degree in modern history. From 1933 to 1934 he explored the Awash through hostile Danakil (or Afar) country to its end in Lake Abhebad. During this dangerous journey he became the first European to traverse the forbidden sultanate of Aussa in north-east Abyssinia. Although his intended companion, David Haig-Thomas, an ornithologist, was unable to join the expedition due to illness, Thesiger managed to collect and preserve no fewer than 872 birds, including 192 species and three new subspecies, from the Danakil region; his report, &#145;Birds from Danakil, Abyssinia&#146;, was published in <span class="italic">The Ibis</span> in October 1935.<h2>
<a name="SudanandtheSecondWorldWar"></a>Sudan, and the Second World War</h2>In 1935 Thesiger joined the Sudan political service, serving as an assistant district commissioner in northern Darfur from 1935 to 1937, and the western Nuer district from 1937 to 1939. The district commissioner in northern Darfur, Guy Moore, taught him to appreciate deserts and to treat the men with whom he lived and travelled as companions instead of servants. Thesiger put this advice into practice in 1935, trekking with camels in April to Jebel Maidob in northern Darfur and in November and December to Bir Natrun in Libya. He shot seventy lion in five years, all of which he tracked on foot or galloped after on horseback. He was charged by lion sixteen times, yet he found the urge to go on hunting them was &#145;irresistible&#146;. In the western Nuer district he killed twelve buffalo and four elephant, but always maintained that he shot &#145;selectively and seldom&#146;  (Maitland, 174). Thesiger's faithful companion of those years, Idris Daud, a reprieved murderer and Zaghawa-Kob&eacute; tribesman, hunted and travelled with him. In 1938 Thesiger and a small party, including Idris, crossed the Sahara from the Sudan border to Tibesti, journeying with camels for three months. The experience he gained of desert travel in Abyssinia, northern Darfur, and the French Sahara was crucial in preparing him to undertake journeys in Arabia after the Second World War, including the two crossings of the &#145;empty quarter&#146; with which his name came to be indelibly associated.<br>
<br>Thesiger viewed the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and its atrocities there as the &#145;rape&#146; of his homeland  (Maitland, 203). Commissioned a bimbashi in 1940, he joined the Sudan defence force and served with Orde Wingate during the Abyssinian campaign in 1941 which restored the exiled Haile Selassie to his throne. He was awarded a DSO on 30 December 1941 for capturing Agibar fort and its garrison of 2500 Italian troops. He wrote in his autobiography: &#145;this &hellip; for a subaltern, was far beyond my expectations&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Life of My Choice</span>, 349). With the rank of major he served in 1942 in Syria, as second-in-command of the Druze legion raised by Colonel Gerald de Gaury. After the Vichy French surrender Thesiger joined Colonel David Stirling's recently established Special Air Service (SAS) brigade. In 1942&#150;3 he took part in raiding and sabotage behind enemy lines in north Africa, and afterwards served with the SAS in Palestine. In 1944, at Haile Selassie's request, he was transferred to Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) as political adviser to the crown prince, Asfa Wossen, at Dessie. Halfway through the two-year appointment, frustrated by restrictions on his movements and apparent lack of co-operation, he resigned.<h2>
<a name="TravelsinArabiaAfricaandcentralAsia"></a>Travels in Arabia, Africa, and central Asia</h2>On his way back to England, at Addis Ababa, Thesiger met Owen Bevan Lean of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit, whom he had met first at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington, in 1933. Lean was then looking for someone experienced in desert travel, to investigate possible locust outbreak centres in Arabia. Thesiger seized this opportunity to explore the empty quarter, the great sand desert of southern Arabia, which had been his ambition for a decade. The empty quarter or Rub&#146; al-Khali had been crossed by Bertram Thomas in 1931 and by Harry St John Philby in 1932. Understandably Thomas had followed the easiest route. Philby's journey, on the other hand, involved a trek of 400 miles between wells, which Thesiger regarded as an epic of desert exploration. Despite such important journeys, vast areas of the empty quarter still remained unexplored. Thesiger first crossed the empty quarter in 1946&#150;7, a journey of 2000 miles that began and ended at Salala, on Arabia's south coast. In February 1947 he met Salim bin Kabina, a sixteen-year-old Bedu of the Rashid tribe, who, together with Salim bin Ghabaisha, also of the Rashid, became Thesiger's inseparable companion during his years in Arabia. Bin Kabina and bin Ghabaisha accompanied his second crossing of the empty quarter, in 1947&#150;8, and his later journeys, in 1949 and 1950, in Oman.<br>
<br>After travelling in Iraqi Kurdistan, in 1950, Thesiger visited the marshes of southern Iraq. From then until 1958, except for 1957, he spent several months every year with the marsh Arabs, sharing the communal life of the villages and travelling by canoe throughout the marshes. To escape the hot, humid marsh summers, he travelled among the mountains of western Asia and Morocco: Chitral in 1952; Hunza in 1953; the Hazarajat, Afghanistan, in 1954; the High Atlas, Morocco, in 1955; and, in 1956, Nuristan, where he returned in 1965. He spent the winter of 1957 in Copenhagen, writing <span class="italic">Arabian Sands</span> (1959), his first and&#151;in his opinion&#151;his finest book. In 1959 he trekked with donkeys across southern Ethiopia to the Kenyan border. The following year, he travelled in northern Ethiopia.<br>
<br>In 1960, accompanied by Frank Steele, whom he had met in 1951 when Steele was vice-consul at Basrah in Iraq, Thesiger journeyed with camels from Kula Mawe near Isiolo, to Lake Rudolf (later renamed Luke Turkana) and Marsabit in the northern frontier district of Kenya. For the next three years he travelled with camels or donkeys in northern Kenya and northern Tanzania. A second book, <span class="italic">The Marsh Arabs</span>, published in 1964, confirmed Thesiger's reputation as a writer and a photographer. Also in 1964 Thesiger crossed the Alborz mountains in Iran, and afterwards joined Bakhtiari nomads on their annual migration through the mountains of Zagros. That same year, in October and November, he crossed the Dasht-i-Lut (Desert of Lot) to Yazd. From June to September 1965 he travelled again through Nuristan and in Badakhshan, where he photographed Kandari nomads and their flocks coming down from Lake Shiva. In October 1965 he tramped from Tafileh, following the Wadi Arabah, to Petra in Transjordan.<br>
<br>Thesiger served in 1966&#150;7 with the royalists during the civil war in Yemen. From 1968 to 1976 he spent much of the year travelling in northern Kenya, including anti-poaching safaris along the Uaso Nyiro River and north-east shore of Lake Turkana. After a six-month voyage round the Indonesian islands in 1977 with the writer Gavin Young, he returned to northern Kenya where he and his Samburu proteg&eacute; Lawi Leboyare built themselves a cedar-wood house near the small township of Maralal. For the next sixteen years, for about nine months every year, Thesiger lived in one or other of the houses he had built for his Samburu adoptive &#145;families&#146;. In September and October 1983 he made his last long journey, using animal transport, when he travelled for six weeks with ponies or yaks across Ladakh. Much later some of the magnificent photographs he took of Ladakh and its people illustrated <span class="italic">Among the Mountains</span> (1998), based on Thesiger's diaries of his travels in western Asia.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>After <span class="italic">Desert, Marsh and Mountain</span> was published in 1979 Thesiger worked on his autobiography, <span class="italic">The Life of My Choice</span>, which he wrote in Maralal, London, and Hyderabad. It was published in 1987, the same year as <span class="italic">Visions of a Nomad</span>, a large-format work devoted to his photography. By 1991 his sight had deteriorated so much that he could neither read nor write unaided. Operations for astigmatism and cataract in 1995 and 1996 improved his failing sight. Meanwhile, in 1992&#150;3, at Maralal, he dictated <span class="italic">My Kenya Days</span> (1994), a postscript to his autobiography. In 1996 <span class="italic">The Danakil Diary</span>, an edited version of Thesiger's original record of his 1933&#150;4 Danakil expedition, was published, illustrated with some of his earliest travel photographs. The second postscript to his autobiography&#151;<span class="italic">Among the Mountains</span> (1998)&#151;was followed in 1999 by <span class="italic">Crossing the Sands</span> (a lavishly illustrated edition of <span class="italic">Arabian Sands</span> with a reduced text); and in 2001 by <span class="italic">A Vanished World</span>. The first anthology of his writing, <span class="italic">My Life and Travels</span>, was published in 2002; <span class="italic">A Life in Pictures</span> in 2004; and an authorized biography by Alexander Maitland, <span class="italic">Wilfred Thesiger: the Life of the Great Explorer</span>, in 2006. In 1993 and 1997 Thesiger loaned collections of his photographs and travel artefacts to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford (after his death the collection was accepted by the government in lieu of inheritance tax, to be held permanently at the museum). The museum arranged an exhibition of his photographs in 1993, and in 2000 it loaned a selection of his desert photographs to exhibitions held in Paris and Barcelona.<br>
<br>In October 1994 Thesiger left Kenya and returned to live permanently in England. From 1994 to 1998 he lived in London in the Chelsea flat he had inherited from his mother. He survived two of his younger brothers: Brian, born in 1911, died in 1982; Dermot, born in 1914, was killed in 1942 when the RAF aircraft he was piloting crashed into the North Sea. His youngest brother, Roderic, born in 1915, died in 2005.<br>
<br>In June 1998 Thesiger moved to a retirement home near Coulsdon in Surrey. There he worked on new editions of his books, gave interviews, and took part in television films about his life. His frequent visitors included old friends, members of his family, other travellers, writers, photographers, and new acquaintances. His admirers from all over the world included Prince Charles. Among his numerous awards and distinctions were the founder's gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1948; the Burton memorial medal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1966; fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature in 1965; honorary fellowship of the British Academy and of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1982; honorary degrees from Leicester and Bath universities (1967 and 1992); a CBE in 1968; and a KBE in 1995.<br>
<br>Thesiger was admitted to the Mayday Hospital, Croydon, in August 2003, after his left hip had been fractured by a fall. He died there of bronchopneumonia a week later, on 24 August 2003. A small private service on 8 September at Putney Vale crematorium, south-west London, was followed on 7 November by a memorial service held at Eton College chapel. His ashes were scattered on Stowe Hill, above the Teme Valley in Powys, close to The Milebrook, where so many of his happiest childhood days were spent. He had never married.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>During more than fifty years spent travelling Thesiger documented magnificently, by his photography and prose, peoples and ways of life which by the time of his death had changed irrevocably or else had vanished altogether. Motivated initially by the excitement of big-game hunting and travel among hostile peoples, by &#145;the lure of the unknown&#146;  (Maitland, 265), and the search for peace of mind among other races, he admitted that since boyhood he had longed to &#145;win distinction as an explorer and a traveller&#146;  (ibid., 123). In this he succeeded. St John Philby praised his post-war journeys as &#145;crowning touches &hellip; on &hellip; exploratory activity in Arabia&#146; and described Thesiger himself as &#145;probably the greatest of all explorers&#146;  (ibid., 380). Sir John Glubb viewed him as &#145;perhaps the last, and certainly one of the greatest, of the British travellers among the Arabs&#146;  (ibid.). Thesiger's achievement was perhaps all the more remarkable in that by the time he started on his travels, there were few areas of the world which had not already been explored. Indeed, in terms of their contribution to purely geographical knowledge, Thesiger's travels cannot be compared with the journeys of discovery made by his famous predecessors in Africa and Arabia during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As he wrote in 1938, &#145;It is not easy to be the first Englishman nowadays&#146;  (ibid., 187). Far more important than where he travelled, however, was the manner in which he travelled, the enduring relationships he forged among tribes in remote, seldom visited areas, and the way he captured for posterity fast disappearing ways of life. By the time of his death he was widely acknowledged as among the greatest of twentieth-century explorers.<br>
