<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zuckerman,  Solly</span>, Baron Zuckerman  (1904&#150;1993), <span class="occ">scientist and public servant</span>, was born on 30 May 1904 in Cape Town, Cape Colony, the eldest son and second of the five children of Moses Zuckerman, furniture and hardware merchant, and his wife, Ruth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Glaser, a prominent Zionist and social worker. His grandparents on both sides emigrated from eastern Europe in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Little is known of their origins: &#145;Wandering Jews were not in the habit of carrying their genealogical records with them&#146;, wrote Zuckerman in his autobiography  (Zuckerman, <span class="italic">Apes</span>, 2). He was educated from 1915 to 1920 at the South African College School, which he loathed, and Cape Town University (to 1924), which he loved and where he won a scholarship to study abroad. His special field of study was the baboon, an interest which he widened to include the chimpanzee soon after he started work in London in 1925. Professor Grafton Elliot Smith encouraged him to join the University College Hospital medical school where he remained until, at the unusually early age of twenty-four, he was appointed anatomical research fellow, prosector, at the Zoological Society in Regent's Park. Thus began a lifelong association with that body. This period was crowned by the publication of what many people would consider his most important scientific work, <span class="italic">The Social Life of Monkeys and Apes</span> (1932), a monograph whose appearance was followed by an invitation to work at a new ape research centre set up in Florida by Yale University. Eighteen months at Yale, interspersed with hectic and highly enjoyable interludes in the high bohemia of New York, were followed in 1934 by his appointment as demonstrator and lecturer in the anatomy department at Oxford. His particular interest was the study of hormones and reproductive rhythms; for this purpose he installed a team of apes in the grounds of the department.<br>
<br>On 30 October 1939 Zuckerman married <a href="#cosubject_73988">Lady Joan Rufus Isaacs [<i>see below</i>]</a>, daughter of the second marquess of Reading. Lord Reading was not best pleased at the prospect of acquiring an unknown South African scientist as a son-in-law, but Zuckerman had charm and determination as well as being obviously destined to succeed. Opposition did not last long, and though Zuckerman was sometimes inconsiderate as a husband and detached as a parent, the marriage endured successfully until his death. There were two children: Paul Sebastian (<i>b</i>. 1945) and Stella Maria (<i>b</i>. 1947).<br>
<br>Towards the end of 1939 Zuckerman had been offered and had provisionally accepted the Sands Cox chair of anatomy at Birmingham University. In November of that year he revived the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95704', "Tots and Quots")</script>, an influential scientific dining club which he had founded in 1931 and which ran until 1946. The war put a temporary stop to Zuckerman's move to Birmingham and instead he found himself researching the effects of blast on the human body. It was the start of an involvement with questions of defence and weaponry which was to occupy much of his next fifty years. So little was known about the subject that Zuckerman was soon the leading authority, and when the blitz began in the autumn of 1940 he and Professor (John) Desmond Bernal, a fellow member of the Tots and Quots, were perpetually on the move, assessing the effects of bombs on buildings and the human beings inside them. This experience inevitably led to Zuckerman being enmeshed in the controversy over the proper use of Bomber Command. On the one hand Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, backed by Winston Churchill's scientific guru, Professor Frederick Alexander Lindemann, claimed that saturation bombing of Germany's urban centres would critically damage that country's industrial capacity and destroy civilian morale. On the other, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, backed by Patrick Blackett, Henry Tizard, and most of the other scientists, maintained that this strategy was expensive and wasteful, and that the bombers would be far better employed attacking communications behind the enemy front line. Zuckerman was emphatically in the second camp; he was right, and his arguments were cogent and forcefully put, but his indifference to the sensibilities of others alienated some potential allies and increased the obstinacy of his opponents.<br>
<br>Bernal had been recruited as scientific adviser to Lord Louis Mountbatten's fledgeling combined operations organization, and he introduced Zuckerman in his wake. It proved an instant success. Mountbatten found in Zuckerman an endless source of ideas and a dry realism which curbed his own more extravagant flights of impetuosity. One of Zuckerman's first tasks was to establish on how many nights a month tides, winds, and darkness would favour landings on the French coast. He devoted several weeks to this study and then reported proudly: &#145;Well, it turns out that there will never be a night suitable for a landing&#146;  (Ziegler, 188). In time this relationship with Mountbatten was to become highly important in Zuckerman's career. For the rest of the war, however, it was Tedder who made the greatest use of his skills. As commander-in-chief, Mediterranean air command, and deputy supreme commander under General Eisenhower, he relied on Zuckerman's advice on a multitude of issues, great and trivial. Perhaps the most significant related to the attack on Pantelleria. This rugged volcanic island between Tunisia and Sicily was heavily defended and was deemed impregnable by its Italian occupants. Zuckerman's task was to gauge the level of bombardment necessary to reduce the defences to impotence. His calculations were amply corroborated; the garrison surrendered just as the assault troops were about to land. The lessons learned in this operation were applied in the invasion of Sicily and, eventually, at D-day.<br>
<br>When the war ended Zuckerman took up his long deferred appointment as professor of anatomy at Birmingham. Though the buildings were magnificent, equipment was woefully deficient and the department existed only in embryo. With characteristic ebullience, and sublime indifference to the demands of other sectors of the medical faculty, Zuckerman built up an &eacute;lite and highly successful student body. Charles Oxnard, later professor of anatomy at the University of Western Australia, wrote that the department &#145;produced an exodus that has taken individuals to every continent, filled many Chairs in Britain and around the world and formed a Zuckerman mafia that has had an incredible influence in each of his areas of biological research&#146;  (private information). Zuckerman could sometimes be ungenerous in the credit he gave to his collaborators and he made ferocious demands on their time and energies, but nobody could deny that he was an inspiring teacher and endlessly stimulating to work with.<br>
<br>For some years Zuckerman's energies were mainly concentrated on Birmingham, but he continued to cherish his contacts with Whitehall. At the end of 1945 he was invited to join Sir Alan Barlow's committee considering how best to develop the country's scientific resources over the next decade. One recommendation was that an advisory committee on scientific policy should be established. The recommendation was accepted. The new council was appointed in January 1947, and Zuckerman, according to his autobiography, was taken aback to be asked to join it. He would have been still more taken aback, outraged indeed, if he had not been. Over the next thirty years he was to serve, often as chairman, on every Whitehall committee in which issues of scientific importance were discussed: the agricultural resources council, the fuel and power scientific advisory committee, the natural resources (technical) committee, the committee on scientific manpower, the committee on control of research and development&#151;the list could be almost interminable.<br>
<br>In 1960 Zuckerman's career took a decisive turn when he became chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence. He retained his chair at Birmingham but on an absentee basis, drawing no salary. His first task in Whitehall was to help implement the Zuckerman procedures, the rules (for whose drafting he himself had been largely responsible) for the control of defence projects and the strengthening of the role of the defence research policy committee. During his four years at the Ministry of Defence his influence was at its greatest. He renewed his close relationship with Mountbatten, who was now chief of defence staff, and the &#145;Zuk-Batten Axis&#146;, as it was nicknamed, became one of the dominant forces in Whitehall. In 1964 the incoming prime minister, Harold Wilson, urged Zuckerman to become minister of state dealing with disarmament negotiations. Zuckerman had no wish to become a politician and refused. Whereupon Wilson replied that, in that case, he must serve as chief scientific adviser to the government as a whole, not just to the Ministry of Defence. Though clearly a promotion, this meant that his influence was spread more thinly and the power that he had exercised was substantially reduced.<br>
<br>Zuckerman retired as chief scientific adviser in 1971, at which point he was created a life peer. He did not lose his interest in public life or defence issues, however. He was particularly active on nuclear matters. He believed that the so-called independent deterrent was neither independent nor likely to deter, and that the limited use of tactical nuclear weapons to combat Russian numerical superiority would inevitably lead to catastrophic escalation. What the West needed, he believed, was not ever larger nuclear stockpiles but more mobile, well-equipped, conventional forces capable of dealing with enemy incursions. As chief scientific adviser he had been closely involved in negotiations for a partial test ban, and he continued to urge a complete cessation of testing until his death. He was an active member of the Pugwash group.<br>
<br>Zuckerman had renewed his connection with the London Zoo in 1955 when he became a member of the council of the Zoological Society of London, and two years later became secretary. He claimed to have supposed that this title was largely honorific, but passivity did not come easily to him and he became in effect chief executive officer. His most controversial reform was to open the zoo to the public on Sunday mornings&#151;thereby abolishing the privileged entry reserved for fellows. This greatly boosted the zoo's revenues but infuriated many of the fellows. It was the first of many campaigns to modernize the zoo and put it on a sound financial basis. In 1960 he installed Prince Philip as president, and in 1977 retired as secretary and took on the presidency himself. There he remained until 1984. His contribution was immense; it must also be admitted that his increasingly autocratic attitude and intolerance of those with slower minds or bureaucratic dispositions caused much discontent.<br>
<br>From time to time it was rumoured that Zuckerman was to become head of some Oxbridge college. He would undoubtedly have been effective, both as administrator and fund-raiser, but he might well have caused considerable disruption in the senior common room. Instead he became a founding force in the new University of East Anglia&#151;a part of England dear to him since he had settled at the Shooting Box in Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, in 1956. His particular responsibility was the school of biological sciences, the first at any British university, but he intervened vigorously in many other fields, invariably assertive, pugnacious, convinced that he was right, and usually justified in that conviction. He left his extensive archives to the university at his death.<br>
<br>Zuckerman wrote three volumes of autobiography: <span class="italic">From Apes to Warlords</span> (1978), <span class="italic">Monkeys, Men and Missiles</span> (1988), and <span class="italic">Six Men out of the Ordinary</span> (1992). He was prone to drop names and overstate his own achievements, but he had plenty of names to drop, his achievements were genuinely impressive, and his writing was always lively. The book to which he attached most importance was <span class="italic">Nuclear Illusion and Reality</span> (1982), a passionate plea for reason and restraint in a world where a single mistake could spell the end of civilization.<br>
<br>Zuckerman was short and stocky, with a prominent nose and rugged features; he was not conventionally good looking, but his energy, vivacity, and directness made him attractive to many women. He received numerous honorary degrees and other honours, was made a CB in 1946, was knighted in 1956, became a KCB in 1964, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1968. He died of a thrombosis at his home in Burnham Thorpe on 1 April 1993; his ashes were interred in his garden. He was survived by his wife and son, his daughter having predeceased him.<br>
<br>Zuckerman's wife, <a name="cosubject_73988"></a><span class="headword">Joan Alice Violet Rufus Zuckerman</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lady Joan Alice Violet  Rufus Isaacs]</span>, Lady Zuckerman  (1918&#150;2000), <span class="occ">hostess and painter</span>, was born on 19 July 1918 in Sussex, the elder daughter of Gerald Rufus Isaacs, second marquess of Reading (1889&#150;1960), barrister and Conservative politician, and his wife, the Hon. Eva Violet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mond (1895&#150;1973), eldest daughter of Alfred Moritz Mond, first Baron Melchett (1868&#150;1930), industrialist and politician. Both parents came from wealthy and politicized families prominent in liberal Jewry, and her mother worked for women's emancipation and for poor children. Her great-uncle Sigismund Christian Hubert Goetze (1866&#150;1939) was an artist and painted murals for the Foreign Office. She trained at St John's Wood Art School (1937&#150;8). After marriage she supported her husband's career, entertaining politicians and royalty, but also did voluntary work with poor children, and produced pastel landscapes. She was a vice-president of the King's Lynn Arts Centre and for many years chairwoman of the Friends of the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia. Proud of her Jewishness, she was devoted to &#145;her people&#146;. She died on 25 March 2000 at Burnham Thorpe, Norfolk, and was survived by her son, Paul.<br>
