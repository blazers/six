</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Defoe,  Daniel</span>  (1660?&#150;1731), <span class="occ">writer and businessman</span>, was the youngest of the three children of James Foe (<i>d</i>. 1706), a prosperous tallow chandler in the parish of Cripplegate and a freeman of the City of London, and Alice Foe, who died some time between 1668 and 1671. His sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, were born on 13 November 1657 and 19 June 1659. Defoe was probably born in London or just outside the city during autumn 1660. During this time of political unrest many citizens' lives were disrupted and records were lost. Carefully educated at the Revd Charles Morton's dissenting academy in Newington Green, Defoe was intended for the nonconformist ministry, but in 1681 he chose to follow his father in trade and the political life of the city. As he said, &#145;the pulpit is none of my office&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Earlyambitionsandcommitments"></a>Early ambitions and commitments</h2>After leaving Morton's academy, Defoe established a home and business in Freeman's Yard, Cornhill, and became a wholesale hosier. On 1 January 1684 he married Mary Tuffley (1665&#150;1732), who brought him a dowry of &pound;3700; they had six daughters (Mary, Maria, Hannah, Henrietta, Sophia, and Martha) and two sons (Benjamin and Daniel), all but two of whom, Mary and Martha, lived into adulthood. Defoe shared the persecution of the nonconformists and was a lifelong supporter of freedom of religion and the press. He had joined Monmouth's revolt in June 1685, fought at Sedgemoor under the banner &#145;Fear nothing but God&#146;, and managed to escape capture after the defeat. In January 1686 he made bail for two widows arrested at a conventicle meeting and soon began to write political essays. He was pardoned for taking part in the uprising in May 1687.<br>
<br>In the late 1680s Defoe began investing in ships and expanding into the export-import business with tobacco, logwood, wine, spirits, and cloth goods. He opened a brick and pantile factory on land in Tilbury that he had leased years before. In the early 1690s he invested in highly speculative ventures such as civet cats and a diving bell. Ruined by misfortunes in shipping, risk taking, and overextension, Defoe went bankrupt in 1692 for an astonishing &pound;17,000, approximately &pound;680,000 in modern money, and was committed to Fleet prison and transferred immediately to king's bench prison on 29 October. He found recognizances, appeared to answer the charges in court, and was discharged. More creditors came forward, and he was committed to king's bench prison again on 12 February 1693. Some of his creditors never bothered to add their debts to the charges against him, and once again men willing to be recognizants stepped forward. Defoe negotiated terms with his prosecutors and received employment as an accountant from men with connections to King William; he worked with a lottery and as an accountant for the commissioner for the glass duty, among other things. His brick and pantile factory continued to clear about &pound;600 per year, and he had contracts with such prestigious projects as the building of the Greenwich Hospital for sailors and mariners. Defoe also began to write for money and to submit &#145;projects&#146; to the government and private investors. His <span class="italic">Essay upon Projects</span> (1697) included the kinds of ideas that were making other men rich. One of them, on naval recruitment and maintenance, eventually helped lead to his invitation to speak to a parliamentary committee. Several show an early, acute understanding of banks, the new credit economy, and the transportation system necessary for increasing trade. Others reveal an acute awareness of social problems and groups of needy human beings, among them widows and &#145;idiots&#146;.<br>
<br>Not only did Defoe write political pamphlets and poetry in support of his hero King William, but he began to exhibit some signs of literary ambition. His poem <span class="italic">The Pacificator</span> joins the ancient/modern controversy and engages such then respected poets as Samuel Garth and Richard Blackmore. His timely satiric poem <span class="italic">The True-Born Englishman</span> required fifty editions by mid-century, and about 1701 he embarked on what he intended to be the great defence of the revolution settlement of 1688 and the poem to establish his reputation as an important poet. <span class="italic">Jure divino</span> is a philosophical verse essay in 12 books, running to 375 pages of heroic couplets. According to Defoe, he never published most of the part composed before his arrest for seditious libel in 1703 because he feared it would give dangerous offence; what has survived was mostly written in prison and was completed during the time of insecurity and distress immediately thereafter. Published in 1706 after delays during which he tried to secure more subscribers and waited out political situations that might have embroiled his poem in new and threatening controversy, it was immediately pirated by a former printer of Defoe's and was even abridged into a chapbook; Defoe claimed that he lost &pound;1500 because of the piracy. His hopes for poetic fame were not quite spent, however. His <span class="italic">Caledonia</span>, a sixty-page poem published in 1706 with a grant from the Scottish privy council, celebrates Scottish history and a number of its most illustrious and historically important families.<h2>
<a name="Fightforreligiousfreedomandthepillory"></a>Fight for religious freedom and the pillory</h2>Between 1688 and 1706 Defoe often wrote about and questioned the practice of occasional conformity, the dissenters' &#145;occasional&#146; taking of communion in the Church of England, which qualified them for employment and government office. In fact, both Defoe's contemporaries and modern historians sometimes blame Defoe for beginning the controversy over occasional conformity. Roger Thomas, for instance, credits Defoe with &#145;the earliest shot in the agitation&#146;  (R. Thomas, <span class="italic">The English Presbyterians</span>, 1968, 124). When the nonconformist lord mayor Sir Humphrey Edwin attended St Paul's in the morning and the Pinners' Hall conventicle in the afternoon in his official robes and with his sword of office, Defoe published <span class="italic">An Inquiry into Occasional Conformity</span> (1698) that included inflammatory phrases such as &#145;playing Bo-peep with God Almighty&#146;. When the next lord mayor, Sir Thomas Abney, also a dissenter, repeated the act, Defoe reissued his pamphlet and added a preface in which he demanded that John How, the prominent minister whose meeting-house Abney attended, either defend occasional conformity or declare against it. How responded with a personal admonition, reminding Defoe that the heart of dissent was the individual conscience and that he was not to set up as &#145;the Conscience-general of Mankind&#146;  (Backscheider, <span class="italic">Defoe</span>, 89).<br>
<br>A full-scale controversy over occasional conformity broke out, during which the moderate King William died unexpectedly. The proposal of the bill to prevent occasional conformity at the beginning of Queen Anne's reign seriously threatened the nonconformists. Even bailiffs, foresters, and scavengers would have to conform, lose their offices, or pay heavy, escalating fines. Nonconformists would be banned from supplying hospitals, workhouses, and prisons with such necessities as bread and firewood. There was general agreement that the intent of the bill was to &#145;incapacitate&#146;. Although Defoe continued to oppose occasional conformity, he recognized the prejudice and extreme desire to oppress that the bill represented and began a print campaign to hold a mirror to the faces of those supporting the bill. The result, his <span class="italic">Shortest Way with the Dissenters</span> (December 1702), collected the key phrases and major arguments of the high-church party and used them in a mock recommendation to &#145;root out this cursed Race from the World&#146;. Defoe was already one of the best-known men in London because of his <span class="italic">The True-Born Englishman</span> and his address to parliament demanding the freeing of the Kentish petitioners, <span class="italic">Legion's Memorial</span> (1701). <span class="italic">The Original Power of the Collective Body of the People of England</span> (1702) is one of the most eloquent defences of the rights of the people and most militant about their relationship to government written in the century. Actually written before King William dismissed parliament in November 1701, it portrayed the king as listening to the people, attacked hereditary monarchy, and with great rhetorical power asserted many of Locke's arguments for contract theory and the supreme power of the people. It &#145;vindicates&#146; the &#145;original right&#146; of &#145;all men&#146; to live under a government dedicated to their benefit: &#145;the People remain &hellip; Original Power endures to the same Eternity the World endures to &hellip; Nor have I advanced any new Doctrine, nothing but what is ancient as Nature, and born into the world with our Reason&#146;  (dedication).<br>
<br>When Defoe's authorship of <span class="italic">The Shortest Way</span> was finally discovered, he hid and attempted to negotiate with the government but was arrested for seditious libel in May and brought before the secretary of state for the southern region, the earl of Nottingham, and then imprisoned in Newgate until 5 June, when he made the &pound;1500 bail. He was sentenced to a large fine, to stand in the pillory three times, and to remain in Newgate until he could find &#145;sureties of good behaviour&#146; for seven years. After a delay of the original sentence to stand in the pillory beginning on 19 July during which Nottingham tried to get Defoe to reveal his &#145;Accomplices&#146; and Defoe was brought before the queen, he stood in the pillory on 29, 30, and 31 July. The pillory was ringed with Defoe's protective supporters, and he appeared as Alexander Pope described him, &#145;unabashed on high&#146;. His <span class="italic">Hymn to the Pillory</span> was sold in the streets and declared defiantly that he was &#145;an Example made,/To make Men of their Honesty afraid&#146;. He spent the next four months in Newgate.<br>
<br>Imprisoned during the critical season for brick making, responsible for a large, mostly female family, and run into greater debt because unable to work, Defoe left Newgate in November with his finances and his reputation&#151;critical for businessmen, who must have credit&#151;severely damaged. By summer 1706 he was in trouble again. He owed over &pound;2000, feared imprisonment for debt again, and chose to submit to a commission of bankrupts. A settlement was reached in August. Defoe was seldom entirely free from debt, and future claims came from all over Great Britain. For instance, in 1713 a Yarmouth man renewed a suit of 1706, and in 1728 some of his London debts were prosecuted anew.<br>
<br>Although Defoe's release from Newgate was arranged by Lord Treasurer Sidney Godolphin and Speaker Robert Harley and he was later pardoned by the queen on 31 July 1704, for the rest of his life Defoe was a marked political agitator, best-known as the writer who was pilloried, and was subject to whimsical, politically motivated arrests. He was often threatened with arrest in 1705 and 1706 for violating the &#145;good behaviour&#146; terms of his conviction and occasionally had to rush to London to defend himself. Immediately after Queen Anne's death in 1714 Defoe was indicted for seditious libel again and arrested on 28 August. Brought before a friendly judge, Defoe accepted a plea bargain in 1715 that secretly pledged him to work for the new secretary of state Charles Townshend, specifically to begin a new moderate tory paper, <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, and to infiltrate as many tory presses and periodicals as he could.<h2>
<a name="Writingcareerandworkforthegovernment17031713"></a>Writing career and work for the government, 1703&#150;1713</h2>After his release from Newgate in 1703 Defoe published <span class="italic">A True Collection of the Author of the True Born English-Man</span>, which attempted to set the record of his writing straight, to remind people of his popular <span class="italic">True-Born Englishman</span>, and to make money from his notoriety, and <span class="italic">The Second Volume of the Writings of the Author of the True-Born Englishman</span>, both important in establishing the canon of Defoe's writing. <span class="italic">The Consolidator</span>, <span class="italic">The Storm</span>, and <span class="italic">A True Relation of the Apparition of Mrs. Veal</span> were also commercial enterprises, although each has important spiritual and political elements. His great achievement of 1704 was to launch <span class="italic">The Review</span>, the ground-breaking periodical that moved English journalism in new directions. Before Defoe, what news was printed was without elaboration, interpretation, or even context. <span class="italic">The Review</span> demonstrated the possibilities of using history and news for propaganda purposes, and pointed out the advantages of a sense of discrete audiences. His first great biographer, James Sutherland, wrote, &#145;If <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> is indisputably Defoe's greatest work, the <span class="italic">Review</span> can at least claim to be his most astonishing performance&#146;  (Sutherland, 106). Defoe wrote nearly every word of it, regardless of where he was or his personal situation, from the first number on 19 February 1704 to the last on 11 June 1713. As Maximillian E. Novak has said:<blockquote>There were a number of one-man editorial sheets that ran for a while, but Defoe raises the level of debate over politics, foreign affairs, and economics. In a sense, he places the <span class="italic">Review</span> in the &#145;public sphere&#146; of the coffee house where ideas that will ultimately transform the politics of a nation may be debated&#151;and all of this five to six years before the <span class="italic">Tatler</span> and <span class="italic">Spectator</span>. (private communication)</blockquote>Charles Leslie, a rival journalist, complained that &#145;the greatest part of the <i>people</i> &hellip; cannot read at all, but they will gather about one that can <i>read</i>, and listen to &hellip; [a] <span class="italic">Review</span> (as I have seen them in the streets)&#146;  (C. Leslie, preface, <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span>, 1704&#150;8, iv). In March 1705, <span class="italic">The Review</span> began appearing three rather than two times a week. The popularity of the Scandal Club section led first to a monthly supplement, which began in October 1704 and lasted for five numbers, and then to the <span class="italic">Little Review</span>, which he began in June 1705 and of which he wrote twenty-three numbers before he tired of it. Dialogue, satires of the press, dramatic irony, and families of characters became regular features of the Club, and both political parties began to take notice of the popularity and influence of the news commentaries.<br>
<br>From the beginning, the paper criticized the press, morals, manners, and the government, especially its conduct of the war with the French. On 29 June 1704 Godolphin demanded that Harley, by then one of the secretaries of state, &#145;find out the author&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bath MSS</span>, 1.58&#150;9). Early in July <span class="italic">The Review</span> changed direction, and Defoe defended himself against charges of being pro-France and began to write about Charles XII of Sweden, a subject related to Harley's responsibilities as secretary of state for the northern region. Letters show that Defoe and Harley had been meeting since at least mid-April, that the specifics of what Defoe would do were being discussed but had not been decided, but by late June they were taking firm shape.<br>
<br>Defoe became one of Harley's agents and an opinion sampler. Over the next three years he extended the possibilities of counter-insurgency, invented practices that survive to the present day, and earned the reputation of master spy. A modern historian has called him &#145;one of the great professionals in all these centuries of secret service &hellip; in himself almost a complete secret service&#146;  (R. Rowan, <span class="italic">Thirty-Three Centuries of Espionage</span>, completed R. Deindorfer, 1967, 102). He set up an unrivalled intelligence network and through his journalistic and pamphlet writing became, in the words of a rival journalist, &#145;the Goliath of his party&#146;  (anonymous tory writer, <span class="italic">The Moderator</span>, 2 June 1710). In summer 1704 he took two trips that covered most of England, taking note of opinions, reporting objections and reservations about the ministry's actions, infiltrating groups, identifying influential men and faction leaders, and writing essays designed to win over the suspicious or uncommitted. His network of acquaintances and friends began sending him information and distributing his political poems, pamphlets, and individual issues of <span class="italic">The Review</span>. Some numbers, such as that for 17 April 1705, were also bought and distributed by other political leaders and agents. Scattered records survive: for instance, of individuals asking for 100 copies of each <span class="italic">Review</span> and lists of men responsible for delivering nearly 2000 copies of one of Defoe's pamphlets. In this time of ferocious political party activity, Harley had embarked on a campaign summarized by the word &#145;Moderation&#146;, and, although Defoe was certainly motivated by his extravagant gratitude to Harley, he believed in moderation and the ministry's domestic and foreign policies and propagated them wholeheartedly.<br>
<br>In autumn 1706 Defoe was one of the agents sent to Scotland to work for the union, and his service there was energetic. He infiltrated some of the most influential groups in Edinburgh and came to control all of the newspapers. As a cover and also as speculation to provide for the future, he invested in the linen and weaving industries and explored the salt trade, among others. He soon had sources in the Scottish parliament, the Church of Scotland, and major business and civic groups. Exposed to numerous dangers in the volatile city, Defoe acted with discretion, courage, and resolution and left a variety of moving, important records of the time. In addition to <span class="italic">The Review</span>, a little over half his letters giving reports to Harley survive, as do his series of pamphlets, all but one beginning with the title <span class="italic">An Essay at Removing National Prejudices Against a Union with Scotland</span>; other occasional essays were designed to explain, persuade, and address what today seem ephemeral details of the treaty of union, and his <span class="italic">History of the Union of Great Britain</span> (1709) was on-the-scene description, commentary, and propaganda. After fifteen months Defoe returned to London, but Godolphin sent him back at the end of March 1708, shortly after the Pretender attempted to land in Scotland and just before the first Scottish elections. Defoe described his job as to provide &#145;plain, naked, and unbyasst accounts both of persons and things&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 256) and sent reports to both Godolphin and the earl of Sunderland, now secretary of state for the southern region. Defoe continued to sample opinion, discuss issues eloquently with his Edinburgh friends, write often impassioned propaganda, and attempt to avoid the danger from random mobs and personal enemies.<br>
<br>His work completed, Defoe returned to London in December 1708, but decided to go back to try to develop his business and newspaper interests in autumn 1709. He took his son Benjamin to study at the University of Edinburgh. The renewed attacks on the dissenters, often seen to have been triggered by the Revd Henry Sacheverell's sermon <span class="italic">The Perils of False Brethren</span>, brought Defoe back to London. Defoe once called Sacheverell the &#145;Foundation of my Destruction&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Review</span>, 6.462), and his joining the battle with such vigour was personal, religious, and political. He saw Sacheverell's arguments as being aimed not only at the dissenters but at the revolution settlement, and he used extreme rhetoric to alarm people about Sacheverell and his opinions and to urge Sacheverell's conviction for seditious libel. On 23 March, however, Sacheverell received what was widely described as a &#145;derisory sentence&#146; of having two of his sermons burnt by the common hangman and being forbidden to preach for three years. Riotous celebrations that included the burning of dissenting chapels all over the country broke out, and Sacheverell enjoyed a royal procession to his new living (clerical appointment) in Selattyn, just inside the English border in Shropshire. Defoe recognized this as the outbreak of long hidden, deep prejudices, and his response was a return to tempered essays on moderation and satires of party extremism that he had hoped the country had repudiated.<br>
<br>Harley returned to power, becoming chancellor of the exchequer in August 1710, and Defoe began to work for him again. Through the next few years of political turmoil Defoe continued his journalistic and other propagandistic writing, and from at least 1707 until the accession of George I he received an income of between &pound;400 and &pound;500 per year from the government. His final trip to Scotland was in autumn 1712, another time of severe Scottish discontent over the imposition of oaths, a bill to tolerate episcopal communion in Scotland, and the decision to extend the malt tax to Scotland when the peace with France was made. His reports were largely optimistic. On 20 September he reports, &#145;An Inclination to Moderation Appeares Among the best men Every where&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 386&#150;7).<br>
<br>During this time and in the aftermath of the dismissal by George I of Harley and his ministry, Defoe expanded his writing strategies. He began to create increasingly distinctive voices and to hone his ability to reach specific groups of readers. In his campaign to explain the new credit economy and to make ending the War of the Spanish Succession acceptable, he designed essays for general readers and for the range of political stances from moderate tory to opposition whig. For instance, a pamphlet of his published by John Morphew, publisher of the tory <span class="italic">Examiner</span>, treated England's separate negotiations with France more favourably than those printed by the whig bookseller John Baker. Some of them, such as <span class="italic">Some Thoughts upon the Subject of Commerce with France</span> (1713), carried an identification of his authorship, &#145;By the Author of the Review&#146;, and, therefore, the assurance that the same point of view and expertise that many readers appreciated would reward their purchase. Others, such as his series on the articles of the treaty with France, are of a piece with his earlier publications for the ministry, some of which are known to have been suggested to him by Harley or other insiders. His writings kept up a running commentary on domestic and foreign events, an evaluation of the performance of the government, and almost unbelievably cocksure advice to his fellow Britons. In his first publication after George's landing, <span class="italic">Advice to the People of Great Britain</span>, for example, he urges everyone to &#145;ease &hellip; foolish strife, forget the Wrongs done to one another, and bury &hellip; Resentment&#146;. He encourages them to have faith in harmonious happy times and never forgets to assess and admonish the Scots.<h2>
<a name="Experimentalfictionsandconductbooks"></a>Experimental fictions and conduct books</h2>Defoe is usually described as an unprincipled man who would write on any side of any question for money. As P. N. Furbank and W. R. Owens have written, &#145;It was a favourite theme of his enemies that he was a mercenary hack &hellip; and he was frequently provoked into complaining both at specific attributions to him and at the general tendency to father all ownerless pamphlets on him&#146;  (Furbank and Owens, xiv). Although over his long life he certainly contradicted himself now and then and changed his mind, he is not guilty of these charges. All serious Defoe scholars agree that a set of core principles and opinions runs through all his works regardless of the reader being addressed. The general opinion is that he was a whig and a moderate by nature, a thorough supporter of the revolution of 1688, and, like most of the people of his generation, suspicious of political parties and reluctant to be identified entirely with one. Unfortunately there is no standard edition of Defoe's works; indeed, fewer than a quarter are in print. Recent biographies that are &#145;full&#146; rather than &#145;critical&#146; (devoted primarily to his &#145;literary&#146; writings) have begun slowly to correct this misconception with scholars, if not with the general public. But several factors continue to obscure the principles for which he stood and sacrificed much: his gift for assuming voices in order to address different groups of people; his ability to select different aspects of an issue to discuss; the untidy, inflated canon that included works that contradicted a great deal that Defoe stood for; his periods of acute economic distress; and the unexamined acceptance of the often heated words of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>Since at least Procopius, political writers had used scandalous memoirs, fake journals and letters, and other forms borrowed from prose fiction to stigmatize the people and actions on the opposite side, and Defoe began to use these forms more frequently. Although Delarivi&egrave;re Manley is the best-known of these writers during Defoe's lifetime, almost all journalists and propagandists resorted to them at some time or another. Although there were anecdotes, some exaggerated and some fictional, in some of Defoe's pamphlets and <span class="italic">The Review</span>, his <span class="italic">Memoirs of Count Tariff</span> published in 1713 is the most important sign of the novelist to come. J. Paul Hunter and Geoffrey Sill have located this political satire in the puritan allegorical and emblematic traditions in which characters are social types and representatives of ideologies that reveal dangerous social and moral truths obscured by appearances and complacent thinking. The characters in <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> are the parts Defoe saw behind the parliamentary vote on the <span class="roman">Bill of Commerce</span>, and he tells a story of groups, such as merchants represented by Alderman Traffick and manufacturers represented by Harry Woolpack, who share interests being set against each other. The characters act in a well-developed fictional structure, and the text is particularly interesting for the ways Defoe illustrates the dynamic relationship among individuals, public opinions, and events, a theme that is especially obvious in his <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span>.<br>
<br>In the year after Queen Anne's death Defoe wrote secret histories, fictional memoirs, histories, and epistles and called his works &#145;accounts&#146;, &#145;reflections&#146;, &#145;expostulations&#146;, &#145;appeals&#146;, &#145;rebukes&#146;, &#145;apologies&#146;, and half a dozen other forms of address. Fully realized dialogues between friends, husbands and wives, and parents and children were used to dramatize his arguments but sometimes also to create individualized, lively mini-personalities existing in a world of intrigue and self-interest. Maximillian Novak characterizes the period between 1715 and 1724 as &#145;the great creative period&#146; of Defoe's life that &#145;produced a literal explosion of fiction&#146;  (Novak, 42).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Minutes of the Negotiations of Monsr. Mesnager</span> (1717) is one of Defoe's cleverest and most informed secret histories. Defoe makes his narrator the lowly under-secretary to Louis XIV who has worked his way up to become an important agent in the negotiation of the &#145;separate peace&#146; that ended the War of the Spanish Succession. One of the earliest French contacts with the Harley ministry, Mesnager was well known to Harley, and the <span class="italic">Minutes</span> exhibit Defoe's inside knowledge. This devastating critique of the treaty of Utrecht (a treaty universally acknowledged to be unworthy of England's military achievement), of a queen determined to have peace at any price, and of a set of ministers doing Mesnager's work by calling the war too costly in men and money supported Robert Harley by portraying him as the only minister who could not be manipulated by the French. The 325-page book was reprinted in 1736 as fiction, and Defoe indeed included many unusual fictional elements. For example, Mesnager is made to react to some English customs and events as though he were as foreign as <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>'s Indians or Oliver Goldsmith's commentator in his &#145;Chinese letters&#146;. Defoe's sense of humour is also in evidence, as he has Mesnager comment on things that Defoe had found enormously frustrating, such as:<blockquote>I have heard of some who have waited upon him [Harley], by his own appointment, on Business of the Greatest Consequence, and have been entertained by him, from one Hour to another, on some Trifle, 'till at last the main Affair has been confin'd to a Minute or two, or perhaps deferred to another Occasion. (D. Defoe, <span class="italic">Minutes of the Negotiations of Monsr. Mesnager</span>, 1717, 183)</blockquote>With the publication of <span class="italic">The Family Instructor</span> in 1715 Defoe began a series of practical divinity or domestic conduct books that eventually covered every stage of life and all classes. These books, especially the first, were enormously popular. Defoe had <span class="italic">The Family Instructor</span> printed by his Newcastle printer John Button to avoid having his reputation as an immoral, hack political writer tarnish its reception; it went through eight editions in five years and twenty by the end of the century. Although the dialogue form had been used in conduct books before, Defoe's was highly original in its leisurely creation of characters, relationships, and stories. Most conduct books were composed of brief essays, summary &#145;morals&#146;, and lists of maxims; Defoe's relatively long, developed narratives with commentary broke new ground. He divided the book in ways that emphasized the form's concentration on marriage, moral relationships, and household governance: &#145;I. Relating to fathers and children. II. To masters and servants. III. To husbands and wives&#146;. Within each, however, are developed characters and suspenseful stories, and in the third part Defoe traces the rebellion, fall, death, and presumed damnation of part one's eldest brother.<br>
<br>The prefatory letter written by the Revd Samuel Wright claimed for the three dialogues what came to be the commonplace claim for the truth of the English novel: &#145;The Substance of each Narrative is <i>Real</i>. And there are some whole Dialogues which, with very little Alteration, I my self could put <i>Names</i> and <i>Families</i>&#146;. This conduct book (and many of the political essays written about the same time) explores &#145;temper and constitution&#146;&#151;what might now be called personality&#151;and their effect on people and their relationships, especially as they affect how people respond to situations. Defoe also broke new ground in directing his conduct book to mature readers rather than to the usual audience, those on the brink of adulthood. The conduct books that followed continued to concentrate on mature married people, although children and even black servants are important, often morally superior and reforming characters. In the second volume of <span class="italic">The Family Instructor</span> (1718) Defoe turned to the adjustments newly married people must make, the establishment of virtuous households, and the behaviour of fathers, especially in their responsibility for the spiritual guidance in their extended households and for learning to balance business and domestic obligations. <span class="italic">Religious Courtship</span> (1722) is a lively set of stories advising young couples on avoiding cheats and selecting virtuous partners. In it a father formerly &#145;hurried in the world&#146; has retired to his home with his three unmarried daughters, and his business is to marry them well. Defoe develops a list of questions that young women should ask, because, as he says in most of the conduct books and several novels, the &#145;hazard&#146; is chiefly on the woman's side. This word and his plots highlight the gamble that marriage is, and Defoe's questions are an attempt to increase the rationality of the decision. Published a month after <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> and eleven months before <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span>, it outlines marriage themes and recommendations that the novels dramatize. Also extremely popular, it was serialized in 1729 in the Philadelphia <span class="italic">Universal Instructor and Family Gazette</span>. <span class="italic">Conjugal Lewdness</span> (1727) explains the purposes of marriage and condemns such things as intercourse during pregnancy.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Complete English Tradesman</span> (1726) is a highly original conduct book, one that offered &#145;useful instructions for a young Tradesman&#146;, and prefigured the better-known <span class="italic">Apprentice's Vade Mecum</span> (1734) by Samuel Richardson. Defoe defines the complete tradesman as one who understands all the inland trade, knows where raw materials and manufactured items come from, and knows all &#145;methods&#146; of correspondence, payment, shipping, and other transactions. One of Defoe's most passionate and personal books, it describes trade as a &#145;calling&#146; in which hands, head, and heart must be applied to business. He covers in detail everything from the diligent, patient, personable demeanour required of the &#145;tradesman behind his counter&#146; to the maintaining of credit and keeping of good accounts. The description of the feelings of the failed bankrupt tradesman is justly famous, but his reflective passages on the growing taste for luxuries and show without substance are even more important social history. About a pastry shop set up for &pound;300, he broods that:<blockquote>the gilding and painting may go a little way, but 'tis the having a shop well fill'd with goods, having good choice to sell, and selling reasonable, these are the things that bring a trade, and a trade thus brought will stand by you and last. (D. Defoe, <span class="italic">The Complete English Tradesman</span>, 1726, 1.317)</blockquote>Tradesmen, their families, and customers take the stage, are given feelings and personalities, and exit.More and more Defoe gave free rein to the creation of fictional worlds, and the flow into fantasy in whatever he wrote became more common. Swept away into a family's tensions, a palace intrigue, a battle, or a person's vexed musings, he published longer and longer works of a more dramatic nature, and he increasingly depicted the flow between the private and public spheres that the scandalous memoirs had always argued and the conduct books allegorized.<h2>
<a name="Thenovels"></a>The novels</h2>Defoe's first novel, <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>, published in 1719 when he was about fifty-nine, brings all his interests together. Crusoe is a disobedient son, arguing with his father, representing opinions of a new world&#151;one where life in England is uncertain but global opportunity beckons, and children are increasingly torn between traditional obedience to family and individual self-satisfaction. Drawn to the sea regardless of parental and what appear to be providential warnings of catastrophe, he finds unbounded economic opportunity in Brazil. Defoe's fascination with travel narratives and with Great Britain as an international trading nation shapes the book and especially its sequel. Defoe also writes out of his engagement with religious controversies of the time, especially the Bangorian and Salters' Hall controversies. When Crusoe instructs Friday in the Christian faith, he is demonstrating the adequacy of scripture and revelation alone. Also inscribed are Defoe's theories of government and of colonization. Crusoe sets himself up as monarch, prince, generalissimo, and finally colonial governor, and perhaps ironically his abandonment of his island is emblematic of the neglect of which Great Britain was often guilty with its Caribbean colonies. In fact, this novel can be placed within Defoe's propaganda for the settlement of the New World and especially his writings about the doctrinal controversies splitting and embarrassing dissenters as well as Anglicans. Above all, however, it is the greatest mythic fantasy ever written of the solitary survivor who will never succumb. He will not starve, and he will not give in to his paralysing fear or extended isolation. Physically, mentally, and spiritually he survives and grows stronger.<br>
<br>Defoe's work always displayed a keen understanding of the reading public, and <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> is no exception. The best-selling books of this time were sermons and travel literature, and Defoe probably conceived <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> along the lines of travel books. Peace and optimism about open seas inspired new books like Daniel Beeckman's <span class="italic">Voyage to and from the Island of Borneo</span> and new editions of a number of earlier works such as Woodes Rogers's <span class="italic">Cruising Voyage Round the World</span> (both 1718). Travel books often began with a restless son and gave prominence to religious elements. Defoe's special contributions to travel literature were the power of his protagonist's personality and the previously unmatched evocation of states of mind&#151;the extended presentations of a person reasoning, choosing, struggling for, if not understanding, acceptance of his fate.<br>
<br>An initial edition of 1000 was printed near the end of April 1719, followed by a second edition on 9 May, a third about 6 June, and a fourth shortly before the publication of the sequel, <span class="italic">Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</span>, in August 1719. By the end of the year, the two parts were published together with a map and six plates. The <span class="italic">Original London Post</span> serialized it in 164 parts. Within a year the book had been translated into French, German, and Dutch. Other writers took note, and books such as Ambrose Evans's <span class="italic">The Adventures and Surprizing Deliverances of James Dubourdieu and his Wife</span> and William Chetwood's <span class="italic">The Voyages, Dangerous Adventures and Imminent Escapes of Captain Richard Falconer</span> began to appear. Six months after <span class="italic">Crusoe</span> was published novels such as <span class="italic">The Adventures &hellip; of Dubourdieu and his Wife</span> were being advertised as &#145;very proper to be bound up with <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Post</span>, 8 Oct 1719). By 1820 at least two different masters of children's schools had translated it into simple Latin with fake words such as &#145;<i>tormenta</i>&#146; for &#145;guns&#146; when modern inventions required them, and in 1869 Lucy Aikin published the ghastly <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe in Words of one Syllable</span>, which was so popular that it enjoyed a second edition in that same year. Penelope Aubin specifically related her travel adventure and island fiction <span class="italic">The Adventures of the Count de Vinevil and his Family</span> to <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> in her preface and recognized it as a new way to instruct and delight. By 1724 there were at least three more female Robinsonades: Aubin's <span class="italic">The Life of Charlotta Du Pont</span> and the anonymous <span class="italic">Jungfer Robinsone, oder, Die verschmitzte Junge-Magd</span> and <span class="italic">Madame Robunse mit ihrer Tochter, Jungfer Robinsgen</span>. In 1731 the first of the great German Robinsonades, Johann Gottfried Schnabel's <span class="italic">Die Insel Felsenberg</span>, appeared.<br>
<br>Defoe gave free rein to his imagination and exulted in the evidence that his analysis of &#145;the modern Vice of the reading Palate&#146; was correct. He believed that novelty sold books, and he provided it. In a time when, as Crusoe said, &#145;The whole World is in Motion&#146;, Defoe's travel books captured his readers' imaginations. In the preface to <span class="italic">Farther Adventures</span> Defoe claimed that the success of <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> came from &#145;the surprising variety of the subject&#146; and &#145;the agreeable manner of the performance&#146;. He promised more &#145;novel&#146; incidents than those in <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>, and he did indeed provide more &#145;incidents&#146;. Within the first hundred pages Crusoe's ship had rescued another ship (with a passenger who had stayed alive partly by eating gloves), Crusoe had heard the stories of battles among the survivors on his island, of wars between cannibal bands, and of an invasion of the island by cannibals. In the last hundred pages Crusoe went by land from the coast of China, through Peking (Beijing) to Archangel where he took a ship to Hamburg, travelled by land to The Hague, and finally arrived in London. During this odyssey he saw the Great Wall, battled Tartar raiders, burnt an idol before the eyes of enraged priests, and rescued a royal political prisoner. Drawn-out tales of elaborate ruses stood next to brief, funny descriptions of people met on the road. Defoe described two &#145;amazing&#146; houses (one of wicker and one of china), defined irony as &#145;speaking in colours&#146;, and had a boatload of natives defiantly bare their bottoms at the English seamen.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Life, Adventures, and Pyracies, of the Famous Captain Singleton</span> was published in June 1720 and covers the part of the known world that Crusoe missed. The idea for <span class="italic">Singleton</span> may have been in the back of Defoe's mind as he wrote <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> because he has Crusoe list among his blessings: &#145;But I am cast on an Island, where I see no wild Beasts to hurt me, as I saw on the Coast of Africa: And what if I had been Shipwreck'd there?&#146; Singleton sails to Newfoundland and the East Indies before he is marooned on Madagascar for his part in a mutiny. He and his fellow conspirators then walk across the wide part of Africa from Mozambique to Guinea. Lions, tigers, leopards, crocodiles, and elephants appear, and Defoe is artful enough to make them both beautiful and menacing. The waterfalls, jungles, and deserts amaze and horrify the men, and Defoe again renders extreme states of mind. At one point Singleton says:<blockquote>Having with infinite Labour mounted these Hills [we saw] a vast howling Wilderness, not a Tree, a River, or a Green thing to be seen, for as far as the Eye could look; nothing but a scalding Sand, which as the Wind blew, drove about in Clouds, enough to overwhelm Man and Beast.</blockquote>The last half of the book traces Singleton's career as a pirate in the West Indies, along the coast of South America, on Madagascar, in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Moluccas, the Philippines, and then below Australia and concludes with his retirement in England.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Captain Singleton</span> is a transition to Defoe's writing about crime and the development of criminal minds. When he wrote <span class="italic">Captain Singleton</span> pirates were a national concern, for they discouraged trade and colonization and put individuals at risk. Defoe's <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span> records the booty taken by a French privateer and comments in the words of many of his creator's contemporaries, &#145;This was a Terrible Loss among the <i>English</i> Merchants&#146;. The state papers include numerous petitions from merchants, shipmasters, traders, and planters for military protection. In 1718 Captain Woodes Rogers had defeated a huge pirate colony in the Bahamas and, in the aftermath, some 2000 had surrendered and received the royal pardon. As Defoe noticed, the centre of pirate operations shifted to Madagascar, and by 1721 the English dispatched navy squadrons to protect the East India Company ships. Reports of the capture and subsequent trials of pirates appeared almost daily in the papers.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> (1716&#150;20) and <span class="italic">A Plan for the English Commerce</span> (1728), Defoe had argued that the destruction of the pirates on the coasts of Africa would be a worthy work for a great, far-sighted king like George I; he had envisioned the European nations joining together to make the seas safe and open to merchants of every nation. Because of the War of the Quadruple Alliance privateers were again being licensed in large numbers and joined the hoard of pirates already in the sea lanes. Moreover, some of the Madagascan pirates were negotiating with the Hanoverian enemy Sweden to become their privateers. In contrast to the opinions he expressed in his non-fiction, Defoe gives a more complex and sympathetic portrayal of pirates in the novels. Crusoe is in danger of being mistaken for a pirate simply because of the ship he has bought. Singleton has nowhere to go and no way of making a living and seems a drifter more than a predator. Descriptions of sailing &#145;up and down&#146;, chasing ships, and deciding more on whim than anything else to try another part of the world alternate with brief and often bloody fights and lists of prizes that give the men wealth they seem unable to enjoy. Quaker William, the witty resourceful Quaker who becomes Singleton's friend, lightens the novel's tone and distracts the reader from the pirates' cruelty and destructiveness so much that even the multiple violent deaths of men who sail with Singleton and Singleton's suicidal despair and paranoid retirement in England make little impression.<br>
<br>Although not his next published novel, <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span> (1722) is the natural extension of these travel novels, as is his <span class="italic">A New Voyage Round the World</span> (1724). Jack, like Crusoe and Singleton, is a citizen of the world and a man on the make in a predatory economy. Like Singleton, he is left on his own in childhood. Over his long life he is a thief, a soldier in northern England, a kidnapped bondservant, a plantation owner and colonial trader, a gentleman traveller, a soldier in France and Italy on the side of France and Spain, a Jacobite who witnesses the battle at Preston (and is, therefore, a rebel), a captive of privateers, and a smuggler. As violent a novel as any written by Tobias Smollett, <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span> depicts a society in which only the legal system works efficiently, and all Jack's occupations seem to be based on warfare, military or economic. His ships are sunk, captured, and confiscated, and in this crazy, evil world he fights for France and is robbed by French privateers, is a traitor because he prefers a former king over a present king, and experiences brutality in the streets, in London, in Edinburgh, on ships, on the plantations, and even in private homes regardless of his wealth, status, or citizenship. Something of a romantic in his individuality and especially in his yearnings for a home, a country, and happiness, Jack is never truly at home in the sombre violent societies in which he tries to operate. Defoe once called gangs, which proliferated as vigorously as pirates in the 1720s, &#145;land pirates&#146;, and Jack briefly belonged to one. Here, as in <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> (1722) and <span class="italic">Captain Singleton</span>, Defoe's fascination with the formation of criminal minds is evident. Denied a calling, religious or familial, Jack is a vehicle for new psychological and historical variations on Defoe's religious and economic themes.<br>
<br>The first part of <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span> shows how the homeless boys in London become gangs of &#145;naked, ragged Rogues&#146; who progress to adult gangs that terrorize travellers and then come to threaten inland trade to the extent that pirates did the import-export business. Their random crimes and their willingness to commit violence, their youth and lack of principles, and the number of men like them in the population made them especially frightening. In <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span>, the novel often paired with <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span>, the first part shows Moll trying to succeed in the occupation that religion and society told her was her destiny and calling&#151;marriage. What she learns, of course, is that:<blockquote>
<div>What makes a homely Woman fair?<br>
</div>
<div>About Five Hundred Pounds a Year<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">The Commentator</span>, 1 Aug 1720)</blockquote>She happens to be &#145;fair&#146;, compliant, and talented in all the arts, such as music, dancing, and conversation, that made women pleasing, but she has no money and no family. What the reader learns is that the marriage market and the thieves' underworld are mirror images&#151;deceit, opportunism, economic motives, and even the class system are the same. Of these novels a contemporary newspaper (<span class="italic">Flying Post</span>, 1 March 1729) reported on their immediate and continuing popularity:<blockquote>
<div>Down in the kitchen, honest Dick and Doll<br>
</div>
<div>Are studying Colonel Jack and Flanders Moll<br>
</div> (Sutherland)</blockquote>In this novel Defoe's belief that he should &#145;contribute &hellip; to the publick Welfare&#146; is especially clear. Both in his exposure of the abuses inherent in the marriage market mentality of his time and in his warnings about underworld practices and their roots he exhibited the same keen interest and almost compulsive imagining of policy making apparent in his <span class="italic">Essay upon Projects</span>. In a small way he used <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> to serve national policy, specifically the somewhat controversial <span class="roman">Transportation Act</span> of 1718, which allowed courts to sentence even clergied felons to transportation to America. On a very limited scale transportation had been used since before the Restoration as an alternative to capital punishment, and by 1700 had become a fairly common form of conditional pardon. The judge could pronounce it or the criminal could petition as Moll Flanders did for transportation. By 1722, the year <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> was published, about 60 per cent of the convicted male clergiable felons and 46 per cent of the women were transported. As resistance began to form on both sides of the Atlantic, Defoe presents transportation as opportunity for the nation and individual criminals who can start afresh and prosper.<br>
<br>Of <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> James Joyce wrote, &#145;The first English author to write without imitating or adapting foreign works, &hellip; to devise for himself an artistic form which is perhaps without precedent &hellip; is Daniel Defoe, father of the English novel&#146;  (J. Joyce, &#145;Daniel Defoe&#146;, ed. and trans. J. Prescott, <span class="italic">Buffalo Studies</span>, 1, 1964, 7). In <span class="italic">The Rise of the Novel</span> Ian Watt concluded of <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span>: &#145;Very few writers have created for themselves both a new subject and a new literary form to embody it&#146;  (Watt, 134). Holding both literary and mass appeal, the novel is one of the most popular of all eighteenth-century novels. Its resilient optimistic heroine with her myriad adventures, griefs, and escapes and the story's happy ending appeal to all kinds of readers. An important portrayal of Defoe's time, the novel continues to challenge readers to confront enduring moral, economic, and social questions. Like all Defoe's novels, it is haunted by questions about evil: What is evil? What is its source? Of what are humans capable? Is a person good or evil, or just the person's words or actions? Is evil part of human nature, as basic as hunger or thirst? How does evil grow in the human heart? Why do the &#145;evils&#146; in a society, such as ignorance and want, result in moral evil for the ignorant and wanting? Is Moll guilty or her society?<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Journal of the Plague Year</span>, published in the same year as <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> and <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span>, may be Defoe's most under-appreciated great novel. H. F., the protagonist, lives in London throughout the plague, and he is torn between fleeing and staying, between pragmatic, even crass economic motives, and spiritual impulses, and, even more importantly, is obsessed with determining the reasons individuals get the plague. Very much a man of the time when the world was poised between the religious certainties of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and modern scepticism and secularism, H. F. collects evidence, ponders, sorts, and entertains or rejects hypotheses about the cause of the plague even as he seeks to understand God's will and occasionally succumbs to superstitions such as bibliomancy. That H. F.'s research is hopeless (the cause of plague was not identified until 1894 as the bacillus <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, which is primarily an internal parasite of rodents and carried initially by fleas) does nothing to detract from the energy of his mind and the questions Defoe raises about ethical conduct, public policy, and human limits. In this new way to cast the questions of the nature of the universe and the individual's relationship to God and his world, Defoe has, in the words of Maximillian Novak, created an innovative character distinguished by his &#145;general sympathy for the human condition&#146;  (M. Novak, &#145;Defoe and the disordered city&#146;, <span class="italic">Publications of the Modern Language Association of America</span>, 92, 1977).<br>
<br>Absorbing contemporary concerns about society can easily be located as major themes or even motivating forces in all Defoe's novels. Just as the plague in Marseilles and the ways it had been used in the debates over restricting the import of calicoes as well as over the <span class="roman">Quarantine Act</span> of 1721 helped shape <span class="italic">Due Preparations for the Plague</span> and <span class="italic">A Journal of the Plague Year</span>, so the South Sea and stock company schemes and his reports of crimes and trials contributed to <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> and <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span>. Always the critical and independent thinker, Defoe could support the ship quarantine in the <span class="roman">Quarantine Act</span> but oppose shutting up houses and point relentlessly at the possible consequences of quarantining entire towns. Defoe's novels demonstrate new ways for literature to participate in immediate debates and to become an instrument of social persuasion but also portray the eternal struggle of the individual against the &#145;wilderness of this world&#146;. Every novel not only records but contributes to the thinking of his contemporaries, and some influenced public policy, as did <span class="italic">Plague Year</span>, which contributed to the repeal of the <span class="roman">Quarantine Act</span> (1721) and to the reshaped act of 1722. The issues, large and small&#151;<span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> and Salters' Hall, <span class="italic">Roxana</span> and the increase in fashionable gambling houses, <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> and transportation, and <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span> and the need for schools for the Blackguard boys&#151;are too numerous to identify. And yet the novels also explore the most enduring themes of life and literature: survival; the search for happiness; man against nature; the desire to escape urban complexity. Defoe's fictions gave literary history the defining characteristics of the novel, those characteristics that set it apart from, for instance, poetry and drama: its &#145;loose and baggy shape&#146; and its &#145;obsession&#146; with the mind, with identity. In fact, the form serves this kind of exploration of character and becomes a source of radical power because it is the structure of the mind and experiences of the character.<br>
<br>With the profits from his novels and his daughter Hannah's profits from her South Sea stock, Defoe paid &pound;1000 to the corporation of the city of Colchester in August 1722 for a ninety-nine-year lease on hundreds of acres of land that belonged to the city and for the timber rights which had never been granted to previous leaseholders. The beautiful healthy oak, ash, and elm trees, if carefully managed, were worth thousands of pounds. Located in the parish of St Michael, Mile End (now Myland), Essex, the land included Kingswood, the Severalls Brinkley farms (sometimes called Kingswood Heath), Tubswick in Lexden Hundred, and Pound Marsh. About the same time Defoe leased Broomfield in nearby Earlscolne parish. Also known as Pound Farm, it was located on the Colne River and had rich clay soil&#151;brick and tile clay soil. These properties already had buildings, fences, houses, and cultivated fields. Defoe reverted to the ambitions of his young manhood. He believed, as he said in <span class="italic">Roxana</span>, that a merchant was:<blockquote>the best Gentleman in the Nation; that in Knowledge, Manners, in Judgment of things &hellip; out-did many of the Nobility &hellip; able to spend more Money than a Gentleman of 5000 l. a Year Estate &hellip; [for] an Estate is a Pond; but &hellip; Trade was a Spring.</blockquote>He bred cattle and raised corn, sold some of the corn as well as cheese, butter, veal, and beef, all established Colchester products. Over the next few years Defoe added honey and oysters to the commodities he sold from Colchester and even began to sell metal buttons, tanned leather, cloth, and imported anchovies in London, St Neots, Lichfield, Coventry, and other Cambridgeshire towns. So intent was Defoe on a second chance that he began to plan a tile factory on the Colchester land. Late in 1723 or early in 1724, he began to try to persuade John Ward, a Nuneaton mercer and linen draper, to become his partner.<h2>
<a name="Economistandglobalcitizen17221728"></a>Economist and global citizen, 1722&#150;1728</h2>Also in 1722 Defoe began writing a series of respected books that changed his reputation again. He began <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus</span>, a huge economic geography with maps protected by a royal patent, and <span class="italic">A Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain</span>, the only book written by Defoe that has consistently been described as approaching <i>belles-lettres</i>. As Pat Rogers says, <span class="italic">A Tour</span> &#145;has been lauded by the most eminent historians as a prime source of understanding for Britain&#146;, both in the eighteenth century and in &#145;the birth of the modern on a global scale&#146;  (Rogers, 11). As Defoe said in <span class="italic">The Great Law of Subordination Consider'd</span>, &#145;I made myself Master of the History, and <i>ancient State of</i> <i>England</i>, I resolv'd in the next Place, to make my self Master of its <i>Present State</i> also&#146;  (P. Rogers, introduction to D. Defoe, <span class="italic">A Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain</span>, 1971, 34). Defoe's love for his country is everywhere in this survey of the entire nation. He begins his <span class="italic">Tour</span> with the statement that his subject is &#145;the most flourishing and opulent Country in the World&#146;, and exults,<blockquote>
<div>Like <i>Eden</i> Fruitful, like <i>Arabia</i> Gay,<br>
</div>
<div>So blest, they scarcely know for what to pray:<br>
</div>
<div>ENGLAND in native Glory springs.<br>
</div> (D. Defoe, <span class="italic">A Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain</span>, 1724, 1.1)</blockquote>Alive to landscape as he had seldom shown himself to be before <span class="italic">Captain Singleton</span>, he described scene after scene in books written in this period and invested these descriptions with the expansiveness and harmony of his vision for his country. He remarked on &#145;the glorious interspersing of capital Cities&#146;, the &#145;safe and capacious Havens&#146;, &#145;magnificent Buildings&#146;, &#145;innumerable Beauties [that] render the &hellip; View desirable and pleasant, and that in the most solid and significant manner&#146;. He was simultaneously alive to history, to commercial produce and possibilities, and to the new tourist industry. The result was that he was the first to compose a book equally useful for those who wanted to view historical antiquities, to tour stately homes, to study agricultural and estate improvements, and to take a picturesque tour (in Rogers's words, &#145;a kind of aesthetic adventure&#146; for persons of sensibility; Rogers, 40).<br>
<br>Defoe began to invent an astonishingly detailed, carefully ordered construct towards which Great Britain might aspire. This construct is worked out primarily in <span class="italic">A Tour</span>, <span class="italic">The Royal Progress</span> (both 1724), <span class="italic">The Complete English Tradesman</span>, <span class="italic">A General History of Discoveries and Improvements</span> (both 1726), <span class="italic">Plan of the English Commerce</span>, <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus and commercialis</span> (both 1728), and several shorter works such as <span class="italic">An humble proposal to the people of England, for the encrease of their trade, and encouragement of their manufactures</span> (1729). In these books Defoe characterized the English people, identified their strengths and advantages, and charted their course to greatness. Typically, he began with surveys&#151;of the present state of England (<span class="italic">A Tour</span>) and of their place in worldwide commercial history (<span class="italic">A General History of Discoveries and Improvements</span>)&#151;and with guides for the most basic cogs in the machine (<span class="italic">The Great Law of Subordination Consider'd</span> and <span class="italic">The Complete English Tradesman</span>). All of them have the spoke and wheel model that made London the centre&#151;goods flowing in to this great port from all over the world and all over Great Britain and then being redistributed throughout the world from this great collection centre. He insisted that London was the only port in the world on which every sea captain could depend to buy his cargo and then reload his ship, and he used homely examples to prove how dependent the country and the world were on the exchange of goods. For example, in a series of lists in <span class="italic">Complete English Tradesman</span>, Defoe shows how ordinary household furnishings and daily attire prove his point; he counts, for instance, eleven regions that contributed to a man's everyday outfit.<br>
<br>Defoe's plan for his country was nothing less than world domination. Trade, not military might, would make this conquest. In <span class="italic">Plan of the English Commerce</span> he wrote, &#145;Trade is the Foundation of Wealth, and Wealth of Power&#146; and in <span class="italic">The Advantages of Peace and Commerce</span> (1729) he said, &#145;if any one Nation could govern Trade, that Nation would govern the World&#146;. He challenged his countrymen to duplicate the pattern of English commerce in their foreign trade. <span class="italic">A Plan of the English Commerce</span> and <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus</span> target countries and products and urge Englishmen to develop trade with them. His plan included establishing England's independence; very high on his list of priorities, therefore, is getting timber, hemp, turpentine, resin, and masts from the American colonies rather than from the Baltic and Scandinavian countries. That shipbuilding and repair had to depend on these fractious countries alarmed him. Another part of the plan was to identify the imports which worked against a favourable balance of trade or were, in his opinion, exorbitantly expensive. He argued that by studying climate as Crusoe had done Englishmen could plant more effectively and, for example, bring the price of coffee and spices down. He saw Africa as the most promising place for this endeavour. England's west coast territory, the part he called &#145;Guinea&#146;, was but two weeks away from London; in contrast, Jamaica with its similar climate was six to ten weeks over the treacherous open sea of the Atlantic. Defoe compared such things as latitude and chided the British for letting &#145;fruitful Soil [lie] waste&#146;. He reminded them that even the slothful Portuguese now grew coffee in Brazil and their arch-rivals the Dutch in Java.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Defoe's last years were not happy. By 1728 he was being sued for debt by John Ward, his tenant and manager of some of the Colchester property, and by Elizabeth Stancliffe and Mary Brooke, who were claiming &pound;800 that Defoe had allegedly owed since 1692. In order to save the Colchester property, Defoe transferred it to his son Daniel, who was forced to mortgage it rapidly and repeatedly. His son Benjamin had quit studying for the law, become a journalist and hack writer, and had already been arrested and sent to Newgate for seditious writing. In October 1729 Defoe lost the Stancliffe&#150;Brooke case in the court of exchequer. Were he not to pay, he could be prosecuted and gaoled for debt. Brooke, who survived Stancliffe, pursued her money until she was granted administration of Defoe's estate in 1733. By that time he had given his daughter Sophia's husband, Henry Baker, a 34 and a half year mortgage on his Stoke Newington house as pledge for her &pound;500 dowry, and on 30 May 1730 Baker took possession. In the final year of his life Defoe moved among various London lodgings and a village in Kent. In his last surviving letter he describes himself as &#145;sinking under the Weight&#146; of &#145;Insupportable Sorrows&#146;. He writes about missing his family and being unable even to have them visit and the special pain from his (correct) belief that he would never see Sophia's first baby.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1731 Defoe died in lodgings on Rope Makers' Alley, a winding street in the heart of the old City of London, and his death was recorded in the St Giles Cripplegate general registry, the registry holding his sisters' baptismal records. The cause of death was listed as a lethargy, what would now be called a stroke. He was buried in Bunhill Fields, the great cemetery for nonconformists, on 26 April 1731. His wife, Mary, was buried beside him on 19 December 1732.<h2>
<a name="Contributionsandlegacies"></a>Contributions and legacies</h2>Even the most conservative lists of Defoe's works include 318 titles, and most Defoe scholars would credit him with at least 50 more. His greatest contributions to his contemporaries were his conception of what Great Britain could become and a style of writing effective for its propagation. His late economic writings offered England the most detailed description of what became England's vision of herself for 150 years and drove her imperial ambitions&#151;championing the settlement of North America when European attention was on South America and the Caribbean, for example. At the time he wrote, Walpole and Bolingbroke debated domestic economic policies, but Defoe made the globe his study. A protectionist like Walpole, Defoe differed from the prime minister in casting a critical eye on the great companies' monopolies and in defending high wages. An enemy like Bolingbroke of stockjobbing and the political liaison with the great companies, he had no patience with Bolingbroke's idealized picture of <i>laissez-faire</i> or with his complaints about the rising power of the Commons. Even as Defoe applauded the measures Walpole took to lessen manufacturers' costs, encourage exports of manufactured goods, and raise the prices of imported goods not used as raw materials, he chafed over the lack of colonial investment and encouragement. None of these men was an original economist and each in his own way was conservative, but Defoe grasped the global reverberations of historical and contemporary actions and saw how symbiotic world trade was better than either of them.<br>
<br>Defoe's immortality will always rest on a few of his novels, and especially on <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span>, that immensely subtle, complex book with its simple plot and a character of compelling reality who appears in one archetypal incident after another. Embedded in world cultural consciousness, <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> has never been out of print. Most people still encounter Crusoe in childhood and never forget him. Only the <span class="roman">Bible</span> has been printed in more languages. From the very beginning Defoe's impact was international, as was the recognition that <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> was a new <i>literary</i> form with revolutionary power to &#145;instruct and delight&#146;. The earliest experts celebrate it as such, as did Ludwig Vischer, who wrote the preface to the 1721 German translation. <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span>, once considered coarse and low, now rivals <span class="italic">Crusoe</span> in classrooms, and <span class="italic">Roxana</span>, whose title character was described by Charles Lamb as &#145;harlot and something worse&#146;, has attracted some of the most sophisticated criticism of the eighteenth-century novel. Students in a range of courses and programmes, including humanities in medicine, are reading <span class="italic">The Journal of the Plague Year</span>, and scholars study <span class="italic">Col. Jack</span> for early attitudes towards slavery and even alcoholism.<br>
<br>Defoe's novels have always led a double life. The greatest writers and thinkers of the eighteenth century praised him, and his novels were notoriously read in kitchens and hovels. Samuel Johnson named <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> as one of only three books readers ever wished longer, and Charles Gildon noted, &#145;Not an old Woman that can go the Price of it, but buys thy Life and Adventures&#146;  (C. Gildon, <span class="italic">The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Mr. D&#151; De F&#151;</span>, 1917, ix&#150;x). The same bifurcation continues today. Critics and students study the art of <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span>, and movies and television films have fixed its reputation as &#145;a novel of lust, survival and protofeminist spirit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Newsweek</span>, 14 Nov 1996, 83). Whether readers emphasize Defoe's intelligent brooding over the problem of crime or over women's situation in the world, see Moll as an example of capitalism run amok or of woman in a man's world, or simply celebrate her resilient spirit, the novel speaks eloquently to every generation. Important theorists indicate why. For instance, Pierre Machery finds Moll &#145;the eloquent, simple critic of love, commerce and marriage, those basic categories of &hellip; society&#146;  (P. Machery, <span class="italic">A Theory of Literary Production</span>, 1978, 247). Hubert Damish says of <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> what is also true of <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span>, that Defoe forces us &#145;to judge our needs, our productions, our values, our cultural heritage, by the sole light of necessity&#146;  (H. Damish, &#145;Robinsonnades I: the Allegory&#146;, <span class="italic">October</span>, 85, 1998, 19). <span class="italic">Roxana</span> is universally described as &#145;disturbing&#146;. Its technical and psychological mastery heightens portrayals of the situation of individuals, especially women, in modern society and themes such as the enquiry into the nature of evil.<br>
<br>In the television production of <span class="italic">Moll Flanders</span> (1996), Moll occasionally turns full face to the camera and asks the audience directly, &#145;What would you do?&#146; <span class="italic">Roxana</span> asks that question in even more complex troubling situations. Indisputably Defoe has created two of the strongest and most important women characters in the history of literature. Both are compelling individuals but they are also &#145;sites&#146; that reveal the forces of history and society. John Richetti points out that Roxana &#145;aspires to a new category and actually declares that her ultimate ambition lies in a powerful androgyny&#146;  (J. Richetti, <span class="italic">Defoe's Narratives</span>, 1975, 195). Critics have turned the most powerful tools of modern theory&#151;psychoanalytic, Foucauldian, feminist&#151;on the novel. And yet <span class="italic">Roxana</span> sells in airports with cover illustrations depicting Roxana gazing in a mirror or emerging from a curtain in her Turkish costume.<br>
<br>Critical interest in <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> has never diminished, and sophisticated work on the novel can be found in chapters in wide-ranging thematic studies and at special conferences. No history or discussion of the English novel is now written without considerable space devoted to Defoe's work. And the novel continues to inspire countless Robinsonade novels, stories, movies, and even television series, and some of the greatest writers, producers, and directors in dozens of countries have adapted it to their times. In the twentieth century Michael Tournier's <span class="italic">Vendredi</span> (1985) and J. M. Coetzee's <span class="italic">Foe</span> (1986) earned critical acclaim, and they indicate the international appeal of the story. Unlike Defoe's novel, many Robinsonades are utopian fictions, such as the influential <span class="italic">Der schweizerische Robinson</span> (1812&#150;13) by Johann David Wyss. Each author reaccentuates different parts of the novel to meet cultural needs and immediate concerns, as <span class="italic">Castaway</span> (2000) did. In this film Friday is a volleyball, and he has also been depicted as robots, fairies, and almost anything imaginable. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, <span class="italic">Castaway</span> was the top film in January 2001, and, like all good Robinsonades, it captured a nation's obsessions, once again testing an Everyman within the myth. Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's <span class="italic">The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</span> (1952) features Crusoe alone for seven of the ten reels of the film, a daring experiment that <span class="italic">Castaway</span> repeats. Bu&ntilde;uel, the master of horror and surrealism, explained that he was attracted to Crusoe's struggle with despair, a theme in a number of his best-known films  (A. Corvin, &#145;The celluloid Crusoe&#146;, PhD diss., University of Wisconsin, 1989, 20&#150;21). <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe</span> has inspired a line of science-fiction films, again written, directed, or produced by the most distinguished people in the field. For instance, Byron Haskin, who directed <span class="italic">The War of the Worlds</span> and Disney's first live-action film, maintained that <span class="italic">Robinson Crusoe on Mars</span> (1964) was the best film he ever directed, and it has been named one of the twenty best science-fiction films ever produced  (ibid., 132&#150;3, 141&#150;2). Dozens of intriguing movies not of this calibre have been made&#151;<span class="italic">Little Robinson Corkscrew</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Mr Robinson Crusoe</span> (1931; Crusoe, Douglas Fairbanks, swings through trees like Tarzan and is rescued by a boatload of pin-up girls), <span class="italic">Sex Family Robinson</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">Mickey Mouse: Mickey's Man Friday</span> (1935), one of six Robinsonade movies Walt Disney made. Movies and made-for-television films are shown frequently, and the 1960 television series <span class="italic">Gilligan's Island</span> is still shown in America. Cartoons such as <span class="italic">Molly Moo Cow and Robinson Crusoe</span> adapt the story creatively. Molly washes up on Crusoe's island and wants to be his friend. He is rude and finally manages to drive her away, but when some stereotypical savages land and Crusoe calls for help Molly returns, rescues him, and becomes his Friday&#151;a bizarre twist to &#145;girl Friday&#146;.<br>
<br>In a time when fewer and fewer eighteenth-century novels are being read or even taught, most of Defoe's have become fashionable and significant again as they speak to modern post-colonial concerns and contribute to an understanding of public-health decisions, crime, cities, the family, and political economy. Again and again Defoe seems not just timely, but prescient.<br>
<br>Defoe's greatest bequests to posterity are his contributions to modern journalism and his place in the development of the English novel and novelistic discourse. From the beginning of his career he worked to design a prose style that would communicate clearly. He wanted to write so that he could not be misunderstood; he wrote<blockquote>the best Rule in all Tongues (viz) to make the Language plain, artless, and honest, suitable to the Story, and in a Stile easie and free &hellip; that the meanest Reader may meet with no Difficulty in the Reading and may have no Obstruction to his searching the History of things by their being obscurely represented. (Backscheider, <span class="italic">Defoe</span>, 532)</blockquote>Although Defoe's style is not praised as often as that of Addison, Swift, or Johnson, it has far more versatility and has always attracted admirers. James Joyce described the style of <span class="italic">A Journal of the Plague Year</span> as &#145;masterly&#146; and even &#145;orchestral&#146;, and countless other novelists have cited Defoe's influence. That Joyce would select for special praise what is perhaps Defoe's most journalistic novel is fitting. The energetic combination of fact, narrative, and editorial commentary that Defoe developed in <span class="italic">The Review</span> serves the novel well. Writing at a time when novels by William Chetwood, Penelope Aubin, Charles Gildon, Eliza Haywood, and Jane Barker wavered wildly among the prose styles of the pastoral romance, the southern European novella, Renaissance euphuism, and &#145;plain&#146; English discourse, Defoe calmly developed a narrative voice that did more to establish the perimeters of novelistic discourse than any other writer. The idea that the phrase &#145;immethodical homespun garrulity&#146; characterizes his writing and that he wrote without much self-consciousness, art, or revision has long been discredited. The manuscript of <span class="italic">The Compleat English Gentleman</span> (first published in 1890, ed. K. D. B&uuml;lbring) shows many corrections, additions, deletions, and revisions as well as a substantial number of the tricks of an experienced, confident, voluminous, and somewhat repetitious writer (abbreviations, sketched or shorthand sections). One of the few novelists who has consistently appealed to the intellectual and the masses, Defoe has never lost his appeal. Several of his novels have never been out of print, and understanding of his importance to the history of the novel continues to grow.<br>
