<span class="headword">Derricke,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1578&#150;1581), <span class="occ">author</span>, was probably a follower of Sir Henry Sidney. It is possible but unlikely that he was the Mr Derricke who, in 1557, was employed to make the great seal for Ireland by direction of Mr Secretary Sir John Bourne. It is more plausible that he was the John Derick appointed as a collector of the custom duty on wine imported into Ireland on 11 November 1569 when Sir Henry Sidney was granted the right to collect such revenue after an act of the Irish parliament (October 1569). It is likely that Derricke remained in Ireland from that date until 1578 when Sir Henry Sidney finally returned to England. He signed the dedication of his <span class="italic">Image of Irelande</span> (1581) to Sir Philip Sidney at Dublin on 16 June 1578.<br>
<br>Derricke's profession is not known for certain. <span class="italic">The Image of Irelande</span> contains twelve plates which he advertises as &#145;Made and devised by him&#146;. This may mean he was an engraver, or possibly he simply drew the originals. It is most likely that the plates were made in London after Derricke's return, possibly by the author and his family as they are similar in style, four being signed &#145;FD&#146; and two &#145;ID&#146;. These six designs are probably the finest woodcuts made in a sixteenth-century English book.<br>
<br>Derricke's work, a mixture of verse and prose, is a staunch defence of Henry Sidney's deputyship, detailing his military triumphs against the native Irish. The book was published by John Day, the most important publisher of illustrated books in the second half of the sixteenth century. It is likely that Derricke witnessed many of the scenes he depicted, further indicating his work's value. It consists of three parts: the first and second detail the evils of the Irish wood kerne; an apparently appended third section narrates the fate of the rebel Rory Oge O'More. <span class="italic">The Image of Irelande</span> is one of the most valuable records of Elizabethan Ireland.<br>
