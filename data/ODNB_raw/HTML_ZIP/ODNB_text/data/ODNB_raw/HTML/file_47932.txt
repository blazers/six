<span class="headword">Deterding,  Henri Wilhelm August</span>  (1866&#150;1939), <span class="occ">oil industrialist</span>, was born in Amsterdam on 19 April 1866, the youngest but one of the five children of Philip Jacob Deterding, captain in the merchant navy, and his wife, Catherina Adolphina Geertruida Kayser. Deterding's father died at sea in 1870, leaving the family in financial straits. His education at the Higher Citizens' School in Amsterdam ceased in 1882, when he was sixteen. He then joined the Twentsche Bank as its youngest employee, where he developed a skill in figures and in reading balance sheets which served him throughout his life. After enduring the tedium of this job for six years, he sat a competitive examination for posts in the Dutch East Indies.<br>
<br>Having come top in this examination, Deterding went east as an employee of the Netherlands Trading Company. He made his mark by disentangling the confused accounts of a branch which was in difficulties; he was later appointed sub-agent in the important Penang branch. More significantly for the future, he became involved in the affairs of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, gaining its directors' goodwill by granting it a loan after all other sources had refused one.<br>
<br>In 1894 Deterding married Catherina Louisa Neubronner (<i>d</i>. 1916); they were to have two sons and a daughter. Three years later he accepted a management post with Royal Dutch, and he and his family moved to The Hague. In 1900, when only thirty-four, he was appointed the company's managing director.<br>
<br>Since the output of Royal Dutch then accounted for only about 2 per cent of the world's oil production, Deterding at once evolved a strategy for building the company up into a major oil enterprise. This meant arriving at understandings with rival companies, on the proverbial principle that &#145;unity gives strength&#146;. He therefore made overtures to Marcus Samuel (first Viscount Bearsted), founder of Shell Transport and Trading which also owned substantial oilfields in the Far East. In 1903 the two men agreed to set up&#151;together with the Rothschilds, who had oil interests in Russia&#151;a joint distribution organization for their eastern output, to be named the Asiatic Petroleum Company. Appointed the first managing director of the London-based Asiatic, he took up residence in England and acquired a country house, Kelling Hall, in Norfolk.<br>
<br>Owing to Samuel's multifarious outside interests and to poor corporate management, Shell a little later ran into grave financial problems, and in 1907 Deterding compelled him to merge Shell into the newly created Royal Dutch&#150;Shell group. Samuel had to accept a minority stake of 40 per cent and the non-executive chairmanship. Deterding held the reins of power with 60 per cent of the shares and the post of managing director; his chief assistant was the very able Robert Waley Cohen. The commercial side of the business was situated in London and the technical side in The Hague.<br>
<br>Although Deterding maintained a very clear vision of striving for global co-operation over oil, so as to avoid price wars, he was not so successful with his American rival, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. He sought understandings over security of supply, and for Asiatic to have a half-share in all oil product markets outside the United States. Standard Oil responded to this audacious proposal by launching a sequence of price wars; in retaliation Deterding acquired a number of oilfields in the western hemisphere, including in California (1913), Venezuela (1913), and Mexico (1918).<br>
<br>Deterding reached an agreement with the Burmah Oil Company, based in Britain, about oil sales in India. In 1909, the year after oil was discovered in Persia, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&#151;the future British Petroleum&#151;was floated in London, and Deterding undertook the marketing of its products. He was therefore incensed when in 1914 the British government acquired a controlling interest in Anglo-Persian. Meanwhile, he had secured for the Shell group a quarter share in the consortium prospecting for oil in Mesopotamia (later Iraq).<br>
<br>Notwithstanding these events, on the outbreak of the First World War, Deterding unreservedly placed the group's oil and tanker fleet at Britain's disposal. From 1916 onwards he worked hard to create an all-British oil combine, to be made up of (British) Shell, Anglo-Persian, and Burmah Oil, as a counterweight to Standard Oil. In 1920 his public wartime service to the allied cause was recognized when he was created an honorary KBE. He thereafter used the title Sir Henri in Britain, though not entitled to do so as he never became a British citizen. Soon afterwards, as his scheme for an oil combine unravelled in the face of widespread hostility in the UK, and with ministers having second thoughts, Deterding suffered a nervous breakdown and lost some of his entrepreneurial dynamism.<br>
<br>Deterding's first wife had died in 1916, and in 1924 he married Lidiya Pavlovna, daughter of the tsarist general Pavel Kudoyarov; they had two daughters. He then bought a residence in Ascot. As a White Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;e, Lidiya helped to fuel his intense anti-communism, caused in large part by the company's loss of its Russian oilfields because of the Russian Revolution. However, that did not deter the company from later buying up large quantities of Soviet oil, which were used to destabilize the Americans' efforts in the Far East.<br>
<br>During much of the inter-war period, the global oil industry was in constant travail, with growth in demand held back by economic depressions and with supplies rising as new oilfields came on stream. To curb the resulting beggar-my-neighbour rivalry, in 1928 Deterding invited the chairmen of Anglo-Persian and Standard Oil of New Jersey to join him at Achnacarry Castle in Scotland. There the &#145;big three&#146; in world oil hammered out a secret &#145;as is&#146; agreement that froze the oil market as it then stood; this laid down a global price structure and encouraged co-operation where appropriate to minimize costs. The cartel agreed at Achnacarry was the last great <i>coup</i> of Deterding's career, and by the 1930s he appeared to have lost the sense of direction that had earlier led John, first Baron Fisher, to refer to him as &#145;Napoleonic in his audacity; Cromwellian in his thoroughness&#146;  (R. S. Churchill, p. 1951). To his cost, Deterding possessed no political antennae; his only declared aim was to make money.<br>
<br>Deterding at this time was progressively coming under the influence of his German personal assistant, Charlotte Minna Knaak, and in 1936 he divorced Lidiya and married Charlotte; they had two daughters. After retiring from Royal Dutch&#150;Shell at the end of 1936, he then spent much time at his new residence in Mecklenburg, Germany. Although the evidence is weak that he actively supported the Nazi regime, he did propose certain schemes which conveyed that impression&#151;for instance, that the group should aid the German economy by providing a year's supply of oil on credit. Whether or not he had the power to make such arrangements, consternation ensued in both The Hague and Whitehall; in fact, Deterding's attitude to the German authorities cooled when he discovered that they were buying from Mexico oil that he regarded as &#145;stolen&#146; from the group (Shell had earlier seen its Mexican oilfields nationalized).<br>
<br>Deterding was remembered as a mercurial man, his flashing smile turning in an instant into violent temper. Of no more than average height, he put great faith in physical fitness, regularly swimming in cold water before breakfast and enjoying long walks and skiing. Deterding died suddenly of angina pectoris while wintering at the Villa Olga, St Moritz, in Switzerland, on 4 February 1939, and was buried a week later in Mecklenburg; he was survived by his wife. The British Foreign Office became agitated in case his company shares might fall into German hands, but the fear proved groundless.<br>
