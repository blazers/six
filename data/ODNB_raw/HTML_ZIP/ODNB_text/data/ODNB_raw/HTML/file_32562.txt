<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coppin,  George Selth</span>  (1819&#150;1906), <span class="occ">actor and politician</span>, born at Steyning, Sussex, on 8 April 1819, was the only child of George Selth Coppin (1794&#150;1854) and his wife, Elizabeth Jane Jackson (1789&#150;1869). His father, of a Norwich family, gave up medical practice for the stage and became a theatrical manager.<br>
<br>As a child the son showed proficiency on the violin and played juvenile characters on the stage. At the age of seventeen Coppin took to his profession seriously, and in November 1837 he was a minor member of the Sheffield stock company, playing Osric to the Hamlet of the young starring tragedian Gustavus Vaughan Brooke. Having developed into a capable low comedian, he was engaged at the Queen's Theatre, Manchester, early in 1841, and in August of that year began an engagement at the Abbey Street Theatre, Dublin. For a time he sang comic songs nightly between the pieces, accompanying himself on the violin. Here he met a fascinating American actress, Maria Watkins Burroughs, the wife of a provincial actor&#150;manager, with whom he eloped to Australia. They landed at Sydney in March 1843 and lived together until Maria's death on 10 August 1848. Coppin acted at the Royal Victoria Theatre, and made a lot of money which, however, was lost in commercial enterprises, and he left Sydney in debt.<br>
<br>In January 1845 Coppin began an engagement at Hobart Town, and in March commenced theatrical management at Launceston, where he had a prosperous season. Three months later he took his company to Melbourne, where he rented the Queen's Theatre Royal, and made his first appearance there in June, when he played Glavis in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span> and Crack in <span class="italic">The Turnpike Gate</span>. Thereafter he moved to Adelaide, where he converted a billiard room in less than two months into a 700-seat theatre, which he opened in November 1846. Here within three or four years he made a fortune from various enterprises, including a tavern and racehorse breeding, only to lose it by speculations in copper mining. After passing through the insolvency court in 1851, he returned to Melbourne and spent a fortnight at the gold diggings: he determined that entertaining the miners would be more profitable than mining himself. Following a short engagement in Melbourne, in 1852 he commenced management at the Great Malop Street theatre, Geelong, where he rapidly made another fortune. He returned to Adelaide, paid his creditors in full, and sailed for England in January 1854. His first appearance was made at the Haymarket, London, in June. Later he fulfilled engagements at Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh, and Dublin. While at Birmingham in August he induced G. V. Brooke to sign articles to star under his management for 200 nights in Australia and New Zealand.<br>
<br>After returning to Melbourne, Coppin reappeared at the Queen's Theatre in December 1854, and the following month began a successful engagement at the Victoria Theatre, Sydney. In June 1855 he opened the new Olympic Theatre, Melbourne, popularly known as &#145;the Iron Pot&#146;, under his own management, and played Colonel Damas in <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span> and Mr Trotter Southdown in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">To Oblige Benson</span>. In August 1855 Coppin married Harriet Hilsden, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bray (<i>b</i>. 1820), a widowed sister-in-law of Brooke. Meanwhile Brooke's tour proved highly prosperous, and Coppin joined him in purchasing the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, which they opened in June 1856. About the same period they acquired the freehold of the Cremorne Gardens Amusement Park; they also owned four hotels. At the Theatre Royal they organized the first grand opera season in Australia. The partnership was dissolved in February 1859, Brooke continuing the management. Coppin then built the Pantheon Theatre; but owing to Brooke's difficulties he resumed control of the Theatre Royal in December 1860.<br>
<br>Harriet Coppin had died on 2 September 1859 following the birth of the couple's third child. On 4 June 1861 Coppin married Harriet's daughter by her first marriage, Lucy Hilsden; they were to have two sons and five daughters. In 1862 he lost control of the Theatre Royal, but in September of that year he completed a new theatre, the Haymarket. A second bankruptcy followed, but he brought out Mr and Mrs Charles Kean to Melbourne in October 1863, and then took them to Sydney, with the result that he paid his creditors in full. After touring with the Keans in America (1864&#150;5) he reappeared at the Haymarket, Melbourne (January 1866), in a variety of characters, including Daniel White in H. T. Craven's <span class="italic">Milky White</span>.<br>
<br>In 1871 Coppin went into partnership with Messrs Harwood, Stewart, and Hennings in the management of the Melbourne Theatre Royal, but suffered a considerable loss through the burning of the uninsured building in March 1872. He immediately took a ninety-nine years' lease of the site and rebuilt the theatre, subsequently transferring the property to the Theatre Royal Proprietary Association, Ltd, of which he remained managing director until his death. At this house in November and December 1881 he gave farewell performances for twelve nights. His last appearance was on 9 December 1881 as Bob Acres in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> and Crack in <span class="italic">The Turnpike Gate</span>.<br>
<br>During the same period Coppin was also engaged in politics. In 1858 he was elected first to the Richmond municipal council and then to the legislative council of Victoria for the south-western province, but he resigned his seat on leaving the colony in 1864 for his American tour. During this time he helped to pass the <span class="roman">Transfer of Real Property Act</span> and to introduce Post Office Savings Banks. He advocated the federation of the colonies and intercolonial free trade and opposed the payment of members. He unsuccessfully sought election in 1866, but from 1874 to 1877 and from 1883 to 1888 he was member of the legislative assembly for East Melbourne. He was then returned to the legislative council, unopposed, for Melbourne (1889&#150;95). He was twice elected chairman of the Richmond municipality, and for two years was chairman of magistrates in that district. His political commitments entailed periodical retirement from the stage, as low comedy and political office were deemed incompatible.<br>
<br>A man of immense energies and extraordinarily diverse interests, Coppin left the mark of his talents upon the colony of Victoria. As early as 1870 he advocated acclimatization, and was the first to import camels and English thrushes into Australia. About 1861, in association with Charles Gavan Duffy, he founded the beautiful watering place Sorrento-on-the-Sea, 40 miles south-east of Melbourne, where Mount Coppin was called after him, and where he maintained a home until his death. In 1868 he built a magnificent residence, Pine Grove, Richmond Hill, Melbourne, where he died on 4 March 1906.<br>
