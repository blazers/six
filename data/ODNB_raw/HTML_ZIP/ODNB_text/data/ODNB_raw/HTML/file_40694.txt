<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hall,  Henry Robert</span>  (1898&#150;1989), <span class="occ">dance-bandleader and radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 2 May 1898 at 23 Bonar Road, Peckham, London, the eldest son in the family of three sons and three daughters of Henry Robert Hall, blacksmith, and his wife, Kate Ellen Smith. Part of his childhood in a poor but happy Salvation Army family in Peckham was spent learning the trumpet. While still at the London county council school in Waller Road, Peckham, he won a scholarship to Trinity College of Music, London, for trumpet, piano, and music theory lessons on Saturday mornings. He left school at fourteen, but his musical education fortunately continued when he was employed at the age of sixteen as a music copyist at the Salvation Army head office in Judd Street, King's Cross. His employer, Richard Slater, worked him hard but helped to develop his talents as player and composer. His &#145;Sunshine March&#146; was later the basis for his BBC signature tune, &#145;Here's to the Next Time&#146;.<br>
<br>In December 1916 Hall enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery. His musical prowess was quickly recognized and he spent much time playing at troop concerts. After the war he undertook desultory engagements in the seedier music halls and played a cinema piano to finance advanced piano lessons at the Guildhall School of Music. In 1922 he accepted a Christmas job as relief pianist at the Midland Hotel, Manchester. A Chopin study played at a minute's notice in the hotel cabaret stopped the show, and Arthur Towle, general manager of Midland Hotels, signed up Hall as resident pianist. Within a year he was musical director of the hotel band, within ten he was in charge of the bands in all thirty-two hotels in the LMS railway group, and when the Gleneagles Hotel opened in 1924 Hall persuaded the BBC to broadcast his band on the opening night. This was the start of a broadcasting career which lasted forty years. In 1924 he married Margery (1894&#150;1976), daughter of Robert Brook Harker, commercial traveller. It was a perfect partnership, and they had a son and a daughter. In 1932 Hall succeeded Jack Payne as musical director of the BBC dance orchestra, a move which involved a large cut in salary, but promised enhanced prospects. His was the first programme to be heard from the newly built Broadcasting House, in 1932.<br>
<br>Hall's purist style of music left some listeners lukewarm, but the impeccably played musical arrangements, often made by Hall himself, and his modest way of announcing the items were appealing. The repertory of straight dance tunes interspersed with novelty items such as &#145;The Teddy Bears' Picnic&#146; soon made the band, broadcasting at teatime and in the evening, enormously popular. In 1934 he had the idea of inviting show business stars to join him and his band in a programme called <span class="italic">Henry Hall's Guest Night</span>. His introductory words, &#145;This <i>is</i> Henry Hall speaking&#146;, became something of a national catch-phrase. The show was an instant success and ran for 972 performances over twenty-three years. The first chat show on British radio, it featured stars including No&euml;l Coward, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, Danny Kaye, and Gracie Fields, with whom he always established an immediate rapport. The programme made him a major figure in the golden age of radio.<br>
<br>A royal command performance, a film <span class="italic">Music hath Charms</span> (1935), and an engagement to conduct the ship's band on the maiden voyage of the <i>Queen Mary</i> showed a widening recognition of Hall's star status. By 1937, when many other dance bands were broadcasting, he asked permission to leave the BBC and take his band with him. Sir John Reith granted it and agreed that they would not be replaced. It was said that 40 million people listened to their final broadcast.<br>
<br>Hall now faced a freelance career touring the major variety theatres with his band topping the bill. Fears that the public would not support a wireless star in the theatre were unfounded. &#145;Sold out&#146; boards were everywhere and Hall was frequently mobbed by the fans. The tours continued during the years of the Second World War, during which Hall also gave troop concerts and guest nights. These strenuous and demanding years culminated in a second royal command performance (1948). After the war Hall began presenting stage shows, notably <span class="italic">Irma la Douce</span> (1958). He continued to appear regularly on radio and television until 1964, and finally announced his retirement in 1970, when he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>A tall, dignified man, immaculately dressed, his dark hair brushed down, with a quizzical face and horn-rimmed glasses, Hall had flair and an engagingly hesitant style, which did not conceal a quiet authority inseparable from a lifetime of demanding high standards from himself and those around him. In return he received universal respect and affection. He was a showman completely in tune with the age in which he flourished. Hall died in Eastbourne after a long retirement, on 28 October 1989.<br>
