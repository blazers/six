<span class="headword">Loane,  Martha Jane</span>  (1852&#150;1933), <span class="occ">nurse and social commentator</span>, was born on 7 February 1852 at 8 North Place, Eldad, Plymouth, Devon, to Jabez Loane (<i>c</i>.1821&#150;1895), a master in the Royal Navy, and Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooley (<i>d</i>. 1852). Her father remarried on 10 November 1852 and his second wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kiddle (1824&#150;1864), spinster daughter of John Kiddle RN, bore a further five children, three boys and two girls. Harriet Loane died suddenly on 7 November 1864, leaving Jabez, then a staff commander, and his six young children devastated by their loss. The family had moved to Southsea by 1863, and the following year Martha began her elementary education as a boarder at the Royal Naval School for Females, St Margaret's, Isleworth, Middlesex. Her formal education was completed in 1870. No details of her whereabouts for the next fifteen years have come to light, though it is possible that she spent time travelling in Europe.<br>
<br>In 1885 Loane decided to take up nursing, a profession which had recently acquired a new respectability, largely owing to the influence of Florence Nightingale. She trained at Charing Cross Hospital, London, and then, under the title of Sister Agnes, worked there as a ward sister, moving in 1888 to Shropshire and becoming a sister-in-charge at the Shrewsbury Royal Infirmary in late 1889. In 1893 she gave up hospital nursing in favour of district nursing. This branch of the profession was conducted largely under the auspices of Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses, a charitable organization founded in 1887, whose objectives included training nurses to care for the sick poor in their own homes. Once qualified, having attended the institute's central training school in Bloomsbury (1893&#150;4), and having gained a midwifery qualification in 1893 from the Obstetrical Society of London, Martha worked as a queen's nurse in Buxton, Derbyshire, for two years before being promoted, in 1897, to the position of superintendent of queen's nurses for the Borough of Portsmouth Association for Nursing the Sick Poor. Martha became a highly respected figure, and was renowned for her efficiency and concern for the poor. Her enforced retirement from nursing in October 1905, following life-threatening appendicitis, was a great loss to the local community and the institute, which considered her to be an outstanding superintendent.<br>
<br>Loane's retirement from nursing did not affect her well-established career as a writer on nursing and social topics. Encouraged by Florence Nightingale in 1895, she made contributions to reviews, journals, and the national press (notably 35 articles in <span class="italic">Nursing Notes</span>, 1897&#150;1907; 23 articles in the <span class="italic">Evening News</span>, 1907&#150;10; and 13 articles in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 1910&#150;11). She also produced six nursing handbooks (<span class="italic">The District Nurse as Health Missioner</span>, <span class="italic">The Duties of a Superintendent in a Small Home for District Nurses</span>, <span class="italic">The Incidental Opportunities of District Nursing</span>, <span class="italic">Outlines of Routine in District Nursing</span>, 1904; <span class="italic">Simple Sanitation</span>, 1905; <span class="italic">Simple Introductory Lessons in Midwifery</span>, 1906). But of greatest significance were her six popular social commentaries (<span class="italic">The Queen's Poor</span>, 1905; <span class="italic">The Next Street but One</span>, 1907; <span class="italic">From their Point of View</span>, 1908; <span class="italic">Neighbours and Friends</span>, 1909; <span class="italic">An Englishman's Castle</span>, 1910; <span class="italic">The Common Growth</span>, 1911), which earned her a reputation as a leading authority on the condition of the working-class poor in Britain. Studies of poverty in Britain owed much to the pioneering, largely quantitative, surveys undertaken by Charles Booth in London and J. Seebohm Rowntree in York. But Loane's commentaries were significant in two major respects: not only were they, uniquely, based on the first-hand experiences of a distinguished queen's nurse who had made repeated and extensive visits to the homes of the poor, but they concentrated on revealing intimate details about the quality of working-class life.<br>
<br>Loane's apparently subjective doorstep accounts provided a penetrating insight into the thoughts and beliefs, emotions, and culture of the &#145;respectable poor&#146;&#151;those who kept &#145;even the most painfully poor and crowded home together&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Queen's Poor</span>, 1905, 27). Infancy and childhood, youth and education, health and welfare, domestic arrangements, courtship, marriage, parenthood and old age, work and play, religion, and the meaning of life and death were all addressed. Loane commented upon legislation which affected the lives of the poor and debated the numerous social problems of the day. Although the solutions which she offered to these did not always meet with unequivocal approval, she was successful in raising public awareness and in highlighting the complex nature of these issues.<br>
<br>What no one ever suspected was that the well-known queen's nurse was, in fact, party to a literary deception that remained undetected during and beyond her lifetime. Direct and indirect references to Martha's nursing career reinforced the popular belief that she was totally responsible for the articles and the social commentaries, but she was evidently only partly responsible. Authorship was attributed variously to M. Loane, M. J. Loane, Martha Loane, and M. E. Loane: although Martha's professional experiences provided the material and thus the credibility for the work, it was her younger half-sister, <a href="#cosubject_68576">Alice Eliza Loane [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who compiled much of the work and who was posthumously credited with writing the books.<br>
<br>No pictures of Martha Loane have apparently survived: the only personal detail that has emerged concerns her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1910, an event that ultimately ruptured her relationship with Alice. Martha died at her home at 22 Woodland Terrace, Lipson, Plymouth, on 16 October 1933, aged eighty-one, and was buried in the Plymouth corporation cemetery, Efford, on 19 October. The sole beneficiaries of her estate, which amounted to &pound;463 8<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., were the Catholic Education Council and the Hospital for Women, Soho, London.<br>

<a name="cosubject_68576"></a><span class="headword">Alice Eliza Loane</span>  (1863&#150;1922), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born on 23 October 1863 at 2 Exbury Place, Green Road, Southsea, Hampshire. The youngest child of Jabez Loane and his second wife, she received her elementary education at the Royal Naval School for Females (1874&#150;81). She published one book under her own name, <span class="italic">Shipmates</span> (1912), in addition to her work published under the name M. Loane. From late 1912 she was an active member of the Bristol Civic League, an organization which dealt with the problems of poverty. She died at 22 Elmdale Road, Clifton, Bristol, on 23 February 1922. Her sister, Beatrice Mary Loane, was her sole beneficiary, but the will was unsigned, and remained unproven until 18 January 1939, four years after Beatrice's death. Probate was then granted to Lloyds Bank; the value of the estate amounted to &pound;2363 5<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.<br>
