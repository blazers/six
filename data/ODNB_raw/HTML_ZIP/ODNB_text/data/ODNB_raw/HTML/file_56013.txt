<span class="headword">Boutmy,  Emile Gaston</span>  (1835&#150;1906), <span class="occ">political scientist and commentator on British life and institutions</span>, was born on 13 April 1835 in Paris. He was the son of Laurent-Joseph Boutmy, a journalist and businessman who died in financial ruin in 1848. Educated at the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, Boutmy became active in liberal journalism in the 1860s, and lectured at the &Eacute;cole Centrale d'Architecture in Paris, but he made his name as founder and first director of the independent &Eacute;cole Libre des Sciences Politiques (Sciences Po), which opened in Paris in 1872. The school, which set out to counteract the defects of French political culture, became the chief route of entry into the higher civil service, and an immensely important influence on French public life. Its success testified both to the power of its founder's vision, and to his practical genius in translating that vision into reality. He was instrumental in communicating his vision to influential friends and in securing financial backing. Boutmy himself taught constitutional law, and his chief publications ranged over the comparative study of constitutions, political institutions and political cultures: <span class="italic">&Eacute;tudes de droit constitutionnel</span> (1885), <span class="italic">Le d&eacute;veloppement de la constitution et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; politique en Angleterre</span> (1887), <span class="italic">Essai d'une psychologie politique du peuple anglais au XIXe si&egrave;cle</span> (1901), <span class="italic">&Eacute;l&eacute;ments d'une psychologie politique du peuple am&eacute;ricain</span> (1902). Boutmy, who was almost blind, married the daughter of an eminent protestant pastor, Eug&egrave;ne Bersier, in 1882. He died in Paris on 25 January 1906.<br>
<br>The approach at Sciences Po to the study of the social sciences was empirical and historical rather than abstract and theoretical; it was also comparative, and was orientated towards comparisons with &#145;Anglo-Saxon&#146; political systems. This was the setting in which Boutmy wrote his own works on English history, constitutional law, and political psychology. A strong Anglophile, he (like his friend H. A. Taine) wrote on England without thinking it necessary to spend much time there. He visited the country only four or five times, and for short periods. His most notable work, the <span class="italic">Psychologie politique du peuple anglais</span>, was composed at a time when collective psychology was a fashionable intellectual pursuit, and it was as a contribution to that genre that it was enthusiastically reviewed in France, by such authorities as the philosopher Gaston Richard and the Durkheimian sociologist C&eacute;lestin Bougl&eacute;. In England, where Boutmy's constitutional writings had been praised by such authorities as Dicey, his venture into collective psychology was less highly regarded: reviewers in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> were unimpressed, though his work was used by the pioneering social psychologist William McDougall.<br>
<br>Boutmy's emphasis was on the formation of national character through the interaction of the primitive characteristics of the race with its physical and human environment. The English were an active people, not given to abstraction or generalization; an energetic people endowed with foresight and self-control. They were also unsociable: the vigorous associative life of the English, prized by previous French observers such as Taine, was valued by Boutmy too, but he saw it as indicative not of a tendency to sociability, but rather of the individualism and self-reliance of the English. Hence &#145;the English, though profoundly individual, are nevertheless peculiarly qualified for collective operations; they have a superior power of coalition and ability to work collectively which is unknown among races who are less active and more absurdly vain&#146;  (E. G. Boutmy, ed., <span class="italic">The English People: a Study of their Political Psychology</span>, 1904, 116&#150;7). Like F. Le Play, but unlike Taine, Boutmy emphasized the survival of the patriarchal family in England. He also differed from Taine in playing down the importance of Anglicanism, which he thought merely &#145;a combination of statesmen&#146;  (ibid., 52). It was the dissenters, he thought, who represented &#145;the heart of the nation&#146;  (ibid., 52).<br>
