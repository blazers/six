<span class="headword">Bradford,  Samuel</span>  (1652&#150;1731), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, was born on 20 December 1652 in St Ann Blackfriars. He was the son of William Bradford, a citizen of London and parish officer during the plague. He was educated at St Paul's School, and then, when that school closed owing to the plague and the fire of London, he went to Charterhouse. He was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1669. He matriculated on 27 March 1672; however, owing to some scruples concerning subscriptions, declarations, and oaths, he did not take the BA. On leaving university he returned home and began to study medicine and then religion. After &#145;a free conversation with some of the best and ablest divines in London&#146; and with the encouragement of Dr Benjamin Whichcote  (Lamb, 215), Bradford reconciled his initial scruples and decided to take orders but, as he was too old to return to university, Archbishop Sancroft admitted him to the degree of MA in 1680 by royal mandate. He subsequently became a private tutor in the families of a number of gentlemen. Following the revolution of 1688, Bradford went to London and was ordained deacon on 15 June 1690, and then priest on 5 October the same year by Bishop Compton. At the beginning of 1691, on the recommendation of William Lloyd, John Tillotson, Edward Stillingfleet, Richard Kidder, John Williams, and Thomas Tenison, Bradford was elected as minister of St Thomas's, Southwark, by the governors of St Thomas's Hospital.<br>
<br>Soon after, Bradford was made lecturer of St Mary-le-Bow, Southwark, and was employed at Carlisle House, Lambeth, by Archbishop Tillotson as the tutor to his two grandsons. Following the death of the incumbent of St Mary's, the parishioners, without Bradford's knowledge, attempted to persuade the archbishop to give the rectory to Bradford. Tillotson did so, although he was not happy at the parishioners' attempt to influence his decision. Bradford was installed as rector of St Mary-le-Bow in November 1693, at which time he resigned his cure of St Thomas's and his lectureship, against the wishes of his parishioners. Bradford was friendly with William Whiston. Whiston reported that as rector of St Mary-le-Bow, Bradford, with the assistance of Whiston, refused communion to Lady Caverly, as she was cohabiting with Sir John Hubern. However, as Hubern refused to marry the lady even after Bradford and Whiston had entreated him to do so, Bradford relented and allowed Lady Caverly to receive communion in the future, despite Whiston's advice to the contrary. Similarly, Bradford refused communion to Sir Charles Duncomb, as Duncomb was reported to be keeping a prostitute in his home. Bradford maintained this ban when Duncomb failed to rectify the situation.<br>
<br>Soon after his appointment to St Mary-le-Bow, Bradford took up the lectureship of All Hallows, Bread Street. On 13 July 1697 Bradford was incorporated at Oxford. At some point Bradford married Jane Ellis, the daughter of Captain Ellis of Medbourne in Leicestershire. Together they had one surviving son, William (<i>c</i>.1696&#150;1728), who became archdeacon of Rochester and vicar of Newcastle upon Tyne. They also had two daughters, Jane, who married Reuben Clarke, archdeacon of Essex, and Susanna, who married John Denne, vicar of St Leonard, Shoreditch.<br>
<br>Bradford appears to have been a low-churchman. He was close friends with a number of prominent low-church divines, to whom he owed much of his career advancement. It was probably for his low-church views that he gained the favour of William III, who had a preference for moderate churchmanship. William was so impressed by a sermon which Bradford preached in front of him on 30 January 1698 that he ordered that it should be published and in March made Bradford royal chaplain-in-ordinary, a position he continued to hold under Queen Anne. Bradford continued to preach on many public occasions, often choosing to speak on the importance of Christian unity and charity.<br>
<br>Whiston, a radical low-churchman and Arian, went so far as to imply in his memoirs that Bradford was sympathetic to Arianism. However, his sermons, a number of which were published, do not indicate such views and the eighteenth-century historian John Lamb records that Bradford wrote to Whiston to deny this claim, asserting &#145;I can as freely and honestly declare myself no Arian as you do that you are one&#146;  (Lamb, 228). Bradford's low-church connection can also be seen in his appointment as Boyle lecturer in 1699. The Boyle lectures had been set up in 1691 by the latitudinarian Robert Boyle and were financially supported by the low-church archbishop, John Tenison. Their aim was to defend Christianity from attack through the reconciliation of divine revelation and reason and, as both the historians Margaret Jacob and John Gascoigne have shown, the appointment of lecturers was subject to a strong low-church influence. As lecturer Bradford preached eight sermons on &#145;The credibility of the Christian revelation, from its intrinsick evidence&#146;, which were later published in 1739 in a collection of Boyle lectures. Bradford was also a whig, as well as a low-churchman, committed to both the revolution and the protestant succession. It is probably for this reason that Thomas Hearne described him as &#145;a most sad, dull, vile wretch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.126).<br>
<br>Bradford was created DD by Queen Anne when she visited Cambridge University on 16 April 1705, and he later received the prebend of Westminster, into which position he was installed on 23 February 1707. However, Anne's reign witnessed a revival of high-church influence in both the political and ecclesiastical establishment and Bradford's religious and political views hindered his career advancement. This was particularly true of 1710, when partisan animosity was at its height. At the beginning of 1710 Queen Anne offered Bradford the bishopric of St David's. As this was a poor bishopric, Bradford accepted on the proviso that he should be able to hold his prebend of Westminster in commendam. Following the Sacheverell trial and the subsequent growth of tory influence in the government, however, Bradford's request was refused and so he was forced to decline the offer of the bishopric. A little later he was again hindered by the tory party when he lost the position of vice-chancellor of Cambridge University to the tory Dr Gooch, by ninety-five votes to fifty-one.<br>
<br>Bradford's career prospects improved with the whig ascendancy following the accession of George I. On 20 May 1716 he was elected master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, a position he continued to hold until 1724. In April 1718 Bradford was offered the bishopric of Carlisle following the translation of William Nicolson to the Irish diocese of Derry. He was consecrated by William Wake on 1 June 1718. On 19 July 1723 he was translated to the bishopric of Rochester, where he replaced the high churchman and tory Francis Atterbury, who had been deprived and exiled for his involvement with a Jacobite plot. Atterbury, a former dean of Carlisle (1704&#150;11), had quarrelled regularly with William Nicolson when he had been bishop. In the same year that he became bishop of Rochester, Bradford was made dean of Westminster. Bradford also held the position of dean of the honourable Order of the Bath and was a member of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Bradford died on 17 May 1731 and was buried, as he had requested in his will, in the north cross aisle of Westminster Abbey. His wife survived him.<br>
