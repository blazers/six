<span class="headword">Parsons,  Laurence</span>, fourth earl of Rosse  (1840&#150;1908), <span class="occ">astronomer and engineer</span>, was born on 17 November 1840 at Birr Castle, Parsonstown (Birr), King's county, Ireland, the eldest of the four surviving sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21481/', "William Parsons, third earl of Rosse (1800&#150;1867)")</script>, astronomer, engineer, and politician, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Field (1813&#150;1885) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54028/', "Parsons, Mary, countess of Rosse")</script>], daughter of John Wilmer Field of Heaton Hall, Yorkshire. His youngest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35396/', "Sir Charles Algernon Parsons")</script>, invented the marine steam turbine. Known in his youth by the courtesy title of Lord Oxmantown, Laurence was educated at home by tutors and under the close supervision of his parents. His father achieved fame by completing in 1845 the great 6 foot reflecting telescope which was to remain the largest in the world for seventy years. The countess of Rosse combined the roles of loving mother, architect, and pioneering photographer. Laurence and his brothers enjoyed a healthy though severe regime at Birr which combined an open-air life with practical work in their father's well-equipped workshops. They had opportunities to meet many of his distinguished friends at Birr or in London. Laurence graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1864 as a non-resident student.<br>
<br>Oxmantown's first scientific paper, entitled &#145;Description of an equatoreal clock&#146;, appeared in the <span class="italic">Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</span> in 1866 and described a hydraulic device to drive a telescope at a constant rate; his propensity for such ingenious inventions never left him. There followed a memoir which appeared in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span> giving an account of observations of the Orion nebula made at Birr from 1848 to 1867. The work collated drawings made over seven seasons with the 3 foot and 6 foot telescopes by several assistant observers (B. B. Stoney, S. Hunter, and R. S. Ball) and by Oxmantown himself. The centrepiece of the paper was a detailed engraving which was judged by J. L. E. Dreyer as being &#145;always of value as a faithful representation of the appearance of the Orion nebula in the largest telescope of the nineteenth century&#146;  (Dreyer, 251). The advent of photography soon rendered such painstaking work unnecessary.<br>
<br>The third earl died in October 1867 and Oxmantown succeeded to the title and the estates. That same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and of the Royal Astronomical Society; he was also appointed high sheriff of King's county. In 1868 he became a representative peer for Ireland. On 1 September 1870 he married Frances Cassandra Harvey-Hawke (1851&#150;1921), only child of the fourth Baron Hawke and his second wife, Frances Fetherstonhaugh. They had three children: William Edward, who inherited as fifth earl and died of war wounds in 1918, Geoffrey, and Muriel.<br>
<br>The fourth earl is best remembered for his work on the radiant heat of the moon which he started in 1868 and continued more or less for the rest of his life, although much of the later work was carried out by his observing assistant, Dr Otto Boeddicker. Lord Rosse was the first to make infra-red measurements of any astronomical body other than the sun and he recognized the importance of compensating for heat emitted by the telescope and by the sky. He detected the radiant heat with a pair of thermocouples at the focus of the 3 foot reflector. He studied how the radiant heat varied with the phase of the moon, and measured how the atmospheric attenuation increased with the distance of the moon from the zenith. He was the first to use an infra-red filter which took the form of a glass plate; by placing the plate in front of the detector he was able to block radiation with wavelengths longer than eight microns. He estimated the temperature of the lunar surface by comparing filtered and unfiltered temperature rises from the moon, the sun, and a blackened reference source of heat. An account of the lunar investigations was delivered to the Royal Society in the Bakerian lecture of March 1873, and he continued to improve his techniques. His initial estimate of 500 &deg;F (260 &deg;C) was revised to 247 &deg;F (119 &deg;C) and later to 197 &deg;F (91.7 &deg;C). A reanalysis of the data by W. M. Sinton in 1958 gave a value of 158 &deg;F (70 &deg;C), in excellent agreement with later observations. Boeddicker remarked that &#145;the results of these investigations were treated with considerable coolness by the scientific world&#146; and that the lack of recognition &#145;was a life-long disappointment to him&#146;  (Boeddicker, 375).<br>
<br>Lord Rosse was a gifted inventor and never happier than when he was busy in his own workshops. As commercial thermocouples were not sensitive enough for the lunar heat observations he made his own and with infinite patience gradually refined their design. In 1869 he fitted a clock drive to the massive 6 foot telescope which allowed it to be used more efficiently. In 1874 the old wooden mounting of the 3 foot telescope was replaced by an equatorial mounting of metal, designed in consultation with B. B. Stoney and W. G. Strype and built by W. Spence of Dublin. Other unpublished work at Birr included observations with a heavy Browning spectroscope, and photography of the Orion nebula and the Milky Way.<br>
<br>Lord Rosse took a keen interest in the development of the steam turbine which was invented by his brother Charles and he served as chairman and director of both the Marine Steam Turbine Company formed in 1894 and the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company formed in 1897. He seldom missed a meeting, often crossing from Ireland specially for the occasion. Charles frequently sought his advice on both technical and business matters. In recognition of his services he was made an associate of the Institution of Naval Architects in 1899.<br>
<br>Lord Rosse was elected chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1885 and remained in office until his death. In 1903 he played a key role in persuading Lord Iveagh to donate a capital sum to provide new buildings and equipment for the departments of experimental physics and botany. Apart from contributing generously to the building fund himself, he made a bequest to the scientific departments in the university. The fourth earl was made a knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1890 and was lord lieutenant of King's county from 1892. He served as president of the Royal Dublin Society (1887&#150;92) and of the Royal Irish Academy (1896&#150;1901). The University of Oxford conferred the honorary degree of DCL in 1870 and Dublin and Cambridge universities that of LLD in 1879 and 1900 respectively. He was made an honorary member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1888.<br>
<br>Insight into Lord Rosse's character comes from the testimony of Boeddicker who was his assistant for twenty-eight years. He attributed &#145;a strong reticence and shyness&#146;  (Boeddicker, 374) to his relatively sheltered childhood. Lord Rosse himself occasionally mentioned &#145;the effort it cost him to mix in public life, and especially to preside and speak at public meetings&#146;  (ibid., 375). On the other hand Boeddicker described him as &#145;a man of extraordinary tenacity of purpose, whom no failure could turn away from a project he once considered feasible&#146;  (ibid.) and added &#145;he was a man of absolute rectitude, with a strong sense of duty, a true friend, a sound and conscientious adviser&#146;  (ibid., 376). After a decline in health lasting two years, the fourth earl died at Birr Castle on 29 August 1908 and was buried in the old churchyard of Birr on 2 September.<br>
