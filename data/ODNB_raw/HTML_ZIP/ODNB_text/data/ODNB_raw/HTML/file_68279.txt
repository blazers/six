<span class="headword">Hinchliffe,  William</span>  (1691&#150;1742), <span class="occ">poet and bookseller</span>, was born on 12 May 1691 and baptized on 24 May at St Olave, Southwark, the son of Edward Hinchliffe, a tradesman, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurt. He was educated at a private grammar school in Reigate, Surrey, alongside his friend Henry Needler. He then served an apprenticeship to Arthur Bettesworth, a bookseller on London Bridge, &#145;and afterwards followed that business himself near thirty years&#146;  (Cibber, 5.24). In 1718 he married Jane Leigh, daughter of a prominent London citizen.<br>
<br>Hinchliffe's first poems were complimentary addresses to Harley on the peace (1713) and to George I on his arrival at Greenwich (1714): the latter is also the earliest traced work of which he was the publisher. He also wrote and published a <span class="italic">History</span> (1716) of the 1715 rising, dedicated to the duke of Argyll. Most occurrences of his name in later imprints are as one of a &#145;conger&#146; (an alliance of booksellers) for joint publication of substantial (often scholarly) works, such as Joseph Trapp's <span class="italic">Virgil</span> (1731&#150;5) or the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions Abridged</span> (1734). His last traced publication is <span class="italic">The Turkish Spy</span>, eleventh edition, eight volumes (1741), in a conger of twenty-two booksellers. His business address was at Dryden's Head, under the Royal Exchange.<br>
<br>In 1718 Hinchliffe published his own <span class="italic">Poems, Amorous, Moral, and Divine</span>, a collection of imitations and translations from Latin, pastorals, complimentary poems, and so on, dedicated to his friend Henry Needler. Some modern scholars think that &#145;The Seasons&#146; in this volume gave hints to James Thomson. Hinchliffe later mastered French and published in 1734 his translation of <span class="italic">La vie de Mahomet</span> (1730) by the freethinker Henri de Boulainviller. The translation was dedicated to his &#145;old Companion&#146; William Duncombe, and carried a preface in which Hinchliffe expresses admiration for Muhammad and denounces popish corruption. At his death he left in manuscript a translation of the first nine books of F&eacute;nelon's <span class="italic">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span>. Hinchliffe died on 29 September 1742 and was buried in the parish church of St Margaret Lothbury. His wife, three daughters, and a son were already dead; he was survived only by his son William.<br>
