<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Humphrey</span>  (1610&#150;1689), <span class="occ">bishop of Bangor</span>, was born in July or August 1610 at Bod-y-fudden in the parish of Trawsfynydd, Merioneth, the third son of Richard Lloyd DD (1573/4&#150;1647?), vicar of Ruabon, Denbighshire, and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. in or after 1648), daughter of Rhydderch Hughes, another cleric. He matriculated from Jesus College, Oxford, on 25 January 1628, but it was from Oriel College that he graduated BA on 23 January 1630. In 1631 he became a fellow of Oriel, where he remained a tutor for many years, and proceeded MA on 12 May 1635.<br>
<br>When parliament's lord lieutenant of Oxfordshire, Lord Saye, visited Oxford in September 1642 Lloyd was &#145;kept as a prisoner at <i>the Starre</i>, for some words uttered by him to this effect that &#147;if he was able he had rather lend the king a thousand pound than one penny to the parliament&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.62). Lloyd was chaplain to John Williams, archbishop of York, who, on 9 April 1644, presented him to the prebend of Ampleforth, but his installation was prevented by the advance of the Scottish army. On 10 June 1647 the House of Lords ordered that he be installed as vicar of Ruabon following the death of the previous incumbent, possibly his father, &#145;he taking the National League and Covenant&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 9.252). Presumably Lloyd did not in the event take the covenant because he either did not take possession of Ruabon or else he was deprived of it soon afterwards.<br>
<br>At some point following the death of Edward Brereton in 1644, and before 1650 or 1651 when a son was born, Lloyd married his widow, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1689), daughter of John Griffith of Cefnamwlch, Caernarvonshire. They had at least three sons, John, Francis, and Richard. His stepson was Edward Brereton, MP for Denbigh Boroughs between 1689 and 1705. Following the Restoration Lloyd returned to Ruabon. In a petition of 1660 he sought confirmation for his prebend at York and also for the archdeaconry of Nottingham. He was presented by the king to the prebend of Ampleforth on 30 July 1660, and installed on 22 September. In another petition of 1660 he enlisted the support of Gilbert Sheldon to ask for the deanery of Bangor, which was not in fact vacant. On 12 September 1661 Lloyd was created DD. In the same year he became vicar of Northop, Flintshire (which he resigned in December 1664) and cursal canon of St Asaph. He was collated dean of St Asaph on 14 December 1663.<br>
<br>In 1673 Lloyd left Ruabon to succeed his brother, Samuel, at Gresford, Denbighshire. On 10 September 1673 a warrant for a <i>cong&eacute; d'&eacute;lire</i> was issued to elect Lloyd bishop of Bangor. On 23 October he was granted permission to hold the archdeaconries of Bangor and Anglesey, the vicarage of Gresford, and the prebend of Ampleforth together with his bishopric. He was enthroned by proxy on 5 January 1674, and the following day a writ was issued summoning him to sit in the House of Lords. He voted by proxy on 20 November 1675 against addressing the king to dissolve parliament. In 1676 he became a canon of Bangor.<br>
<br>In 1685 Lloyd procured the archdeaconries of Bangor and Anglesey and the sinecure of Llanraeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch, Denbighshire, to be annexed to the bishopric. Lloyd's episcopate was marked by his firm maintenance of the rights of the Church of England and his unbending hostility to dissent. He distrusted the missionary activities in Wales of the presbyterian Thomas Gouge, whose attempts to dispel popular ignorance and spread the protestant word in the dark corners of the land were supported by both nonconformists and moderate Anglicans, and who had sought Lloyd's support for his Welsh edition of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. To Lloyd Gouge was using his preaching tours to sow sedition and religious disaffection in the minds of the gentry and of the &#145;credulous common people&#146;  (Jenkins, 184). Lloyd made his will, &#145;sick and weake in body&#146;, on 22 December 1686, adding a codicil on 9 January 1689. He died on 18 January 1689 and was buried in Bangor Cathedral.<br>
