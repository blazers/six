<span class="headword">Willett,  Ralph</span>  (1719&#150;1795), <span class="occ">book collector and connoisseur</span>, was born on 8 August 1719, probably on St Kitts in the West Indies, the elder child of Henry Willett (<i>c</i>.1680&#150;1740), plantation owner on the island, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1691&#150;1724), daughter of Colonel John Stanley of Nevis. The Willett family originated in Gloucestershire, but their fortunes, which had been ruined by their royalist sympathies, were repaired by Willett's grandfather Ralph Willett (<i>c</i>.1652&#150;1694), who migrated to the West Indies about 1671. In 1729 Willett was sent to England with his brother Henry (1721&#150;1733). He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 23 June 1736 but did not take a degree, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 4 January 1739. On the death of his father the following year Willett became immensely rich. Samuel Baker's map of 1753 records him as owning five plantations on St Kitts. In 1751 he acquired an estate at Merly in the parish of Great Canford in Dorset where, from 1752 to 1760, he oversaw the building of a grand house notable for its splendid interior. A view was engraved at Willett's expense for John Hutchins's <span class="italic">Dorset</span> (1774). Willett was pricked sheriff of Dorset on 1 February 1760. He was elected FSA on 15 December 1763 and FRS on 21 June 1764.<br>
<br>Willett's wealth allowed him to indulge an interest in early typography. He visited the Imperial Library in Vienna, took lessons in typefounding, and presented two papers to the Society of Antiquaries in support of Mainz as the birthplace of printing. The first (<span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, 8.239&#150;50), read on 26 May 1785, was addressed to Owen Salusbury Brereton, and the second (ibid., 11. 267&#150;316) to John Topham. A third paper, on British naval architecture (ibid., 11. 154&#150;99), drew on manuscript material in Willett's possession. Willett's library of over 8000 volumes contained more than 80 incunabula, including seven Caxtons and four block books. Most of the books were in fine bindings, and many on vellum and large paper. A large room was built to house the library in a wing added to the south-east of Merly in 1772. The books were placed in huge ornately carved mahogany bookcases topped by a total of twenty-four busts of eminent men. Executed in plaster on the coved ceiling by the modeller William Collins were elaborate designs by which Willett, assisted by Joseph Banks and James &#145;Athenian&#146; Stuart, traced the rise and progress of knowledge. Above the doors were paintings by Richard Wilson and Solomon Delane representing Athens in its flourishing and ruined states. In 1776 Willett printed for presents 200 copies of an octavo pamphlet describing the room. He also produced a French translation, and in 1785 reprinted both versions in a folio with twenty-five engravings. In 1790 he printed a classed catalogue of the library in octavo.<br>
<br>Willett was twice married, on both occasions by special licence at the town house in Dean Street, Soho, London, which he occupied from 1760. Although he married his first wife, Annabella Robinson (<i>c</i>.1718&#150;1779), on the day before her death on 10 December 1779, a joint tablet erected by Willett in the chancel of the parish church at Great Canford records forty years spent by the couple in mutual happiness. His second wife, whom he married on 15 May 1786, was Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Locke (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1815), the widow of Samuel Strutt, an assistant clerk in parliament. Willett died at Merly on 13 January 1795 and was buried at Great Canford parish church twelve days later. His lengthy will with seven codicils contains generous bequests to various relations, including the MPs John Stanley, John Willett Payne, and Sir Ralph Payne. Willett's heir was his second cousin John Willett Adye (1745&#150;1815), MP for New Romney (1796&#150;1806), whom he had adopted from his infancy. By the terms of the will Adye changed his name to John Willett Willett.<br>
<br>With the depreciation of West Indian property in the early years of the nineteenth century Willett's collections were dispersed, and the two pairs of balancing wings he had added to Merly, including the library building, were torn down. The bulk of his extensive collections of prints and drawings was sold by Thomas Philipe in eight sales between June 1808 and May 1814. Many of the drawings were the work of the botanical artist George Dionysius Ehret, whose friendship Willett enjoyed for over twenty years, and for whom he acted as executor. A large part of the engravings had been purchased by Willett at the Mariette sale of 1775, and the finest examples were acquired by William Beckford. Willett's paintings, from the Orleans Gallery and other fine collections, were auctioned by Peter Coxe over three days commencing on 31 May 1813. Although a number of the 128 lots were bought in, the sale realized over &pound;7000. The Merly library was auctioned by Leigh and Sotheby over seventeen days between 6 and 24 December 1813, the 2720 lots of books fetching &pound;13,223 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The sale excited great interest, and many of the choicer items found their way into the Spencer, Grenville, Devonshire, and White Knights collections. Thomas Frognall Dibdin helped compile the catalogue, and it was while examining the block books at his house in Kensington that William Young Ottley's interest in the origin of printing was first aroused.<br>
