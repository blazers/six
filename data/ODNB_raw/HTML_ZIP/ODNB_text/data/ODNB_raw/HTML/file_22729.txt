<span class="headword">Preston, Sir  Simon, of Preston and Craigmillar</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1575), <span class="occ">administrator and provost of Edinburgh</span>, was the eldest son of George Preston of Preston and his wife, Isabel Hoppringle. His family had possessed the lands of Preston, Midlothian, since the reign of William the Lion, and the lands and castle of Craigmillar, just outside Edinburgh, since 1374. There was a long association between the Prestons and the burgh of Edinburgh. From 1434 members of the family frequently acted as sheriff and lord provost and were among the patrons of the burgh church of St Giles, which had a Preston aisle founded within it in 1455, next to the existing family tomb in the Lady Aisle. The precious relic of the arm bone of St Giles, centrepiece of the annual St Giles's day procession, was presented by the family about 1450.<br>
<br>Simon Preston is mentioned as a bailie of Edinburgh on 24 August 1538. He served as lord provost between 1538 and 1543 and again in 1544&#150;5. In 1538 he was one of the twelve who formed the official reception for Mary of Guise's arrival in Edinburgh. On 25 August 1540 he had a grant from the town of the office of common clerk for life, which was confirmed by a letter of privy seal two days later. On 5 June 1543 he and his second wife, Janet Beaton, a relative of Cardinal David Beaton, were granted the lands of Balgawy in Forfarshire and those of Craigmillar and Preston. In May 1544, when an English army under the earl of Hertford attacked Leith and Edinburgh, Craigmillar Castle was surrendered to the invaders, seemingly to avoid damage to it. The valuables placed in it by Edinburgh inhabitants for safe keeping were plundered, and Preston himself was taken to London as a prisoner. No details survive of his imprisonment and release, and little is known of his activities between then and the summer of 1560, when he travelled via London to France, in order, according to William Maitland of Lethington, who claimed to be a &#145;near relative&#146;, to recover debts owed to him by Mary of Guise  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 1.250). In January 1561 he was appointed by Queen Mary as one of the four commissioners to convey the news of the death of her husband, Fran&ccedil;ois II, to the Scottish privy council.<br>
<br>After her return to Scotland in August 1561 Mary was an occasional visitor to Craigmillar Castle, which lay barely 2 miles to the south of the royal palace of Holyroodhouse. The closeness of the link between her and Preston may be exaggerated: though he was perhaps in an inner circle of trusted friends of the queen, most of whom were minor lords or lairds, few of the royal visits to Craigmillar were of any length, and it was not until 1565 that Preston, now advanced in years, experienced direct royal patronage. On 23 August 1565, against the background of the failed rebellion by Moray, and after a series of brushes with hardline protestants in the capital the queen dismissed the provost, Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie, who had held office continuously since the Reformation crisis of 1559&#150;60, and replaced him with Preston. At the time of the burgh's annual election five weeks later, the queen imposed a leet on the burgh. Knox's description of those on it as &#145;a number of papists, the rest not worthy&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, 2.171) was jaundiced and inaccurate. It did include some Roman Catholics, excluded from office since 1560, but it was made up mostly of substantial merchants who were moderate-minded protestants. The effect was that protestant activists were removed from office until after Mary was deposed in 1567.<br>
<br>The role of Preston of Craigmillar in the leet and after was ambiguous. His religious stance is also hard to pin down. It is no surprise that the patron of the burgh's cult of St Giles before the Reformation should have been regarded with suspicion by Knox, who condemned him as a &#145;right epicurean&#146; for his loyalty to the queen after the Riccio murder. In the earlier crisis which followed the Darnley marriage and Moray conspiracy of 1565, however, Knox admitted that Preston had &#145;showed himself most willing to set forward religion, to punish vice and to maintain the commonwealth&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, 2.113, 171). Yet Preston also had a number of Roman Catholic connections, and in April 1568 he conferred a free burgess-ship on his kinsman, David Hoppringle, even though two years earlier Hoppringle had fallen foul of the authorities for his marriage by Roman Catholic rites to the daughter of the royal macer Thomas Crichton.<br>
<br>Preston was Catholic in sympathies but probably a nominal protestant, and his concerns, like those of the bulk of the merchant and legal establishment in the capital, were conservative, eirenic, and consensual. As such he served the burgh well, occasionally defending it against heavy-handed action by Mary's administration. Against a background of growing resentment among the burgh's merchants at the crown's spiralling fiscal demands, in September 1565 Preston negotiated the purchase of the superiority of Leith for the burgh, in return for a loan of 10,000 merks to the queen. This was a turning point for the capital in its long efforts to secure control of its port. When the town clerk, Alexander Guthrie, was forfeited for his involvement in the Riccio murder in March 1566, Preston, sensitive to the threat to burgh privilege, opposed his replacement by a royal nominee. His actions during the attempted take-over of the burgh by Moray on 31 August 1565, and again on the night of the Riccio murder on 9 March 1566, showed a concern for order and authority which appealed to the conservative-minded burgh establishment as well as to the queen. Although Preston understandably failed to raise the town to resist Moray's forces entering the burgh, the rebels found little support and retreated on hearing of the approach of the royal army. In 1566 his actions were more decisive: according to Knox, Preston led about five hundred townspeople &#145;in warlike manner&#146; down the High Street to Holyrood to defend the queen, but retreated on the order of Darnley  (<span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, 2.180).<br>
<br>The balancing act continued afterwards. Although Preston continued as provost in October 1566 by means of another royal leet, which was seen as a further example of undesirable interference by the crown in burgh affairs, Preston survived the crisis which brought about the deposing of the queen in July 1567. He remained provost almost to the end of the Moray regency, until replaced by the more overtly Marian figure of William Kirkcaldy of Grange in September 1569. In November 1567 he arranged the gift to the town of the collegiate church of Trinity College, which was intended as a hospital. In the meantime his crucial role in providing stability in the capital as its provost had not prevented his entering royal service. He was appointed to the privy council on 5 November 1565, one of the lesser or professional men who lay behind its reorganization in 1565&#150;6; his attendance was fairly regular. This brought him into association with Bothwell. He was also made keeper of the royal castle at Dunbar, where much of the Royal Artillery was housed, and appointed to a commission to oversee the royal ordnance.<br>
<br>It was during Mary's two-week stay at Craigmillar from 20 November 1566, recuperating from the sudden illness which had struck her at Jedburgh, that plans were discussed among key members of the privy council, including Lethington, Moray, and Argyll, for separating Darnley from the queen. Preston's role in the crisis which brought about the downfall of the queen in June 1567 was largely passive, though he was a party to the bond of 10 June seeking her deliverance from Bothwell. When she was brought into the capital by the confederate lords after Carberry, she was briefly lodged in his house on the north side of the High Street. Preston did not emerge into the open, either before or after Mary's forced imprisonment, as a queen's man. Six days after Mary's escape from Lochleven he entered into a bond with Kirkcaldy of Grange to maintain the cause of the infant king and the regent Moray. By the time Kirkcaldy took over the office of provost of Edinburgh from him in September 1569, Preston was ready to bow out of active politics. In June that year he had arranged formally to resign the lands and barony of Craigmillar to his heir apparent, David, the son of his first marriage, to Elizabeth, daughter of William Menteith of Kerse, Stirlingshire. By 12 June 1570 Preston was in Paris, from where he wrote to Sir William Cecil, informing him of a proposal made by Charles IX on behalf of Queen Mary. After that he fades from the record. He died some time before 8 March 1575.<br>
