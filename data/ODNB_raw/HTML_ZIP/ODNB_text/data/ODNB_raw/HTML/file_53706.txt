<span class="headword">Marie,  Nathaniel</span>  (1577&#150;1642), <span class="occ">Reformed minister</span>, was born in Beaumont, in Leicestershire, the son of Jean Marie (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1589&times;93), minister of the protestant church at Lion-sur-Mer in Normandy, France, and of the French and Walloon refugee congregation in Norwich, and his wife, Marie le Noble (<i>d</i>. 1620). By 1593 the French and Walloon refugee churches in England were raising money to have Nathaniel educated for the ministry and in July 1595 he signed a formal agreement promising his services to the churches. He entered the University of Leiden to study theology in October 1597, and in August 1601 he was inducted as a third pastor of the French church of London, joining Robert le Ma&ccedil;on de la Fontaine and Aaron Cappel. Shortly thereafter, on 10 November 1603, he married Ester or Esther Delaune, daughter of the physician and minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7452/', "William Delaune (c.1530&#150;1611)")</script> (who appointed him a co-executor in his will) and sister of the physicians <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7449/', "Gideon Delaune")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7450/', "Paul Delaune")</script> and of Peter Delaune, minister of the French church at Norwich. Over the succeeding several years they had ten children.<br>
<br>Marie's career does not appear to have been exceptional outside of the normal performance of his pastoral duties. Indeed Isaac Casaubon, for one, does not appear to have thought highly of Marie's theology or preaching ability  (Casaubon, 854, 965). However, as a minister of the presbyterian French church in London, he was at the heart of the movement for Calvinist reform in England and of English support for the European Calvinist churches. He maintained constant contact with leading English puritans, Scottish presbyterians, and representatives of the Calvinist churches on the continent. All the events surrounding the stranger churches in England in the early Stuart period directly involved him, and in particular he played a leading role in the churches' defence of their ecclesiastical liberties and separate status in the face of Archbishop Laud's attack on them between 1634 and 1636. He appears also to have written extensively on theology, although without ever publishing his works, for in his will of 25 May 1639 he bequeaths to his son John &#145;my seven hand written bookes in folio guilt upon the leafes&#146; and exhorts him &#145;to show them unto learned men to see if any of them bee worthy of printing&#146;  (Guildhall Library, 9171/28, fol. 404<i>v</i>); nothing is known of the fate of these manuscripts.<br>
<br>Marie died on 3 or 4 August 1642, and was buried at St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, on 5 August. He was survived by his second wife, Esther le Fevre, whom he had married on 16 April 1637, and by many of his children.<br>
