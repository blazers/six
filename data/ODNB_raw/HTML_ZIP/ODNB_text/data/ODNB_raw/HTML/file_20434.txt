<span class="headword">Oasland <span class="st"> [Osland]</span>,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1625, <em>d.</em> 1703), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Lower Snead Farm, Rock, near Bewdley, in Worcestershire, the second son of &#145;Edward Osland and Elizabeth his wife&#146;, and he was baptized in Rock church on 22 May 1625. His father, a substantial yeoman, owned Lower Snead Farm. Henry was educated at Bewdley grammar school and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was greatly influenced by the master, Thomas Hill. Oasland had a conversion experience while attending the sermons of Samuel Hammond, fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge. After conversion Oasland, as his manuscript autobiography records, felt contrition for the time he had spent in his youth in dancing, archery, and stage plays. He was admitted a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 27 April 1646, and graduated BA in 1650 and MA in 1653.<br>
<br>On new year's day 1650 Oasland attended the famous disputation on infant baptism between Richard Baxter and the anti-paedobaptist John Tombes, held in Bewdley Chapel. For a brief period Oasland officiated at Sheriffhales in Shropshire, in the absence of the incumbent, and later in 1650, having refused the post twice already, he accepted the position of curate at Bewdley Chapel, where he remained until his ejection in 1662. He was ordained in 1651 at St Bartholomew by the Exchange in London.<br>
<br>There can be no doubt that the dominant influence on Henry Oasland during his Bewdley ministry was Richard Baxter, the minister in nearby Kidderminster. After the inception of the Worcestershire Association of ministers in 1652 Oasland was one of Baxter's chief supporters and helpers. Baxter thought him &#145;the most lively, fervent, moving Preacher in all the County&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.91). In 1653 Oasland was able to alert Baxter to the need to write about the contribution that magistrates could make to clerical discipline, a topic that Baxter discussed at length in the years 1656&#150;9.<br>
<br>Oasland's letters to Baxter, together with other evidence, reveal the problems that he faced in Bewdley: the interference of John Boraston, rector of Ribbesford (his ecclesiastical superior) and the attitude of the Bewdley Baptists, to whom he wrote two letters in 1652 urging them to recognize his authority. He wanted to institute church discipline and pastoral oversight on the pattern of what Baxter was doing in Kidderminster, but felt that his opportunities at Bewdley were severely limited, though he does seem to have achieved a considerable measure of success. At one point he wanted to form a &#145;private&#146; church out of his congregation, an idea that Baxter opposed&#151;successfully, it seems  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Richard Baxter</span> 1.121). Calamy says that Oasland catechized the children of Bewdley on Thursdays, and if he was late in coming from Baxter's lecture, they would go and meet him and bring him to the town &#145;in a sort of triumphant manner&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 2.886).<br>
<br>On 24 July 1660 Oasland married Mary Bradley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Henzey (<i>d</i>. 1706), at Old Swinford church. A widow, she was the daughter of the Stourbridge glass maker Joshua Henzey. In November 1661 Oasland was arrested because of his alleged involvement in the so-called Packington plot, an alleged presbyterian rising. He remained a prisoner until April 1662. On Bartholomew day, 24 August, he preached his farewell sermon. After his ejection he lived both in Stourbridge and in Bewdley. He continued, says Baxter, &#145;Preaching up and down privately where he can have opportunity, with Zeal and Diligence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.91), and Calamy recorded that &#145;He has often preach'd to a numerous Congregation of Nailors and Colliers, &amp;c., in a Place surrounded by a Mud-wall, and he stood under a Tree&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 2.890). He preached in most of the midland counties.<br>
<br>The sufferings of the nonconformists at this period led Oasland, like many others, to become impatient of the non-separating nonconformity favoured by Richard Baxter. In 1670 the differences between the two friends widened into an at least temporary breach, in which Oasland wrote to a friend about Baxter, &#145;No man hath so lost himself&#146;, and Baxter wrote to Oasland accusing him of &#145;servility and people-pleasing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Richard Baxter</span> 2.92, 93). Under the declaration of indulgence of 1672 Oasland's houses at Bewdley and Oaken in Codsall, Staffordshire, were licensed for presbyterian worship. The declaration was withdrawn in 1673, but the situation of nonconformists was eventually to improve after the passing of the <span class="roman">Act of Toleration</span> in 1689. Oasland continued preaching until about a fortnight before his death, at Wordsley, Kingswinford, in Staffordshire, on 19 October 1703. When he was buried in Kingswinford church, no fewer than twelve funeral sermons were preached for him.<br>
<br>Henry Oasland died intestate, but there is an inventory of his goods (totalling nearly &pound;38), taken on 1 November 1703, at the record office in Lichfield. In the parlour chamber are &#145;some old books&#146;, valued at &pound;5 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. The most interesting item is &#145;the decedent's Interest in the Coal Works&#146;, worth &pound;18 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The &#145;Coal Works&#146; in question were probably at Wordsley in Kingswinford, where Oasland was living at the time of his death. Henry Oasland has perhaps two main claims to our attention. He was a key member of the Worcestershire Association of ministers in the 1650s, and he was, after 1662, a nonconformist preacher in the heroic mould. In addition, his spiritual autobiography (which deserves to be far better known) offers a remarkable insight into the mentality of a seventeenth-century puritan.<br>
