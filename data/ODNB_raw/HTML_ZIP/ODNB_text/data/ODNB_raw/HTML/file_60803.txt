<span class="headword">Hall,  William</span>  (1800&#150;1847), <span class="occ">bookseller and publisher</span>, was born on 19 October 1800 in London, where he was batpized at St Lawrence Jewry on 24 November 1801, the son of John Hall and his wife, Elizabeth. He emerged from an obscure past to become a partner with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47460/', "Edward Chapman (1804&#150;1880)")</script> in 1830 in a bookselling and publishing business housed in narrow premises at 186 Strand, London. Chapman and Hall's first enterprises, usually joint ventures with other firms, were, in the words of John Forster, &#145;ingenious rather than important&#146;  (Forster, 1.87), being modest periodicals and factual compendia. By 1835 they were expanding into illustrated fiction and magazines issued weekly or monthly; such periodicity encouraged customers to return to the shop on a regular basis and recycled the firm's capital often. In December 1835 the comic artist Robert Seymour, who was doing other work for Chapman and Hall, proposed to them a monthly serial spoofing Cockney sportsmen. He had prepared some initial drawings and needed a writer to produce accompanying letterpress. A few weeks later Charles Whitehead, just hired to edit a monthly, <span class="italic">Library of Fiction</span>, which the firm launched in April 1836, was asked by the proprietors if he knew the real name of Boz, who had recently contributed lively sketches to the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> for which Whitehead had formerly worked. He did; it was Charles Dickens. William Hall then paid a visit to Dickens in his Furnival's Inn chambers on 10 February 1836. Dickens immediately recognized him as &#145;the person from whose hands&#146; he had bought in December 1833 a copy of his first story, just published in the <span class="italic">Monthly</span>. Both hailed this as &#145;a good omen&#146;  (preface to the <span class="roman">Cheap Edition</span>, <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span>). Dickens listened to Hall's proposal and agreed to it in principle, though in fact he made many alterations from the first, and after Seymour's suicide in April took control of the venture. The result, <span class="italic">Pickwick Papers</span>, grew into an unprecedented success, both because of its exuberant humour and sympathy and because its serial issue at 1<i>s</i>. per month put upwards of 40,000 copies into circulation, some &pound;2000 into Dickens's pockets, and made about &pound;14,000 for his publishers.<br>
<br>Hall, a brisk businessman who inspired respectful awe in the clerks, paid most attention to the commercial aspects of the firm. It proved most generous to Dickens, buying out competitors who could not keep up with his accelerating popularity and price, and capitalizing on the mode of serialization both in monthly parts (reissuing the previously published <span class="italic">Sketches by Boz</span> in twenty 1<i>s</i>. parts from November 1837 to June 1839 and the newly composed <span class="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</span> in the same format from April 1838 to October 1839) and, at Dickens's request, in weekly numbers (<span class="italic">Master Humphrey's Clock</span>, containing <span class="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</span> and <span class="italic">Barnaby Rudge</span>, from 4 April 1840 to 4 December 1841). During these heady days &#145;the best of booksellers past, present, or to come&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 1.601&#150;2) gave many celebratory dinners and gifts. Dickens attended Hall's marriage, an event he fictionalized for <span class="italic">Sketches of Young Couples</span> which Chapman and Hall published in 1840. There Mr Chirrup (Hall) is described as having the smartness and &#145;the brisk, quick manner of a small bird&#146;  (Waugh, 6). The Halls resided at Norwood, where they hosted pleasant, playful evenings. Hall's younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11988/', "Spencer Hall (1805&#150;1875)")</script>, a skilled bibliographer and librarian of the Athenaeum from 1833 until his death, took a &#145;kind interest&#146; in Dickens's election to the club in 1838  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 1.399, n.5).<br>
<br>Dickens's friend the lawyer John Forster became literary adviser to Chapman and Hall by 1837. In addition to supervising Dickens's publication arrangements, he edited the <span class="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</span> after the firm bought it late in 1841, and he brought other authors to the Strand, notably Thomas Carlyle. But in the early 1840s the firm was still largely dependent on Dickens, so when in August 1841 Dickens asked for a year's retirement, with advances to be set against future works, Hall and Chapman were troubled. They agreed reluctantly: Chapman was &#145;very manly&#146;, Dickens judged, while Hall, &#145;with his pocketfull of figures and estimates&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 2.366) seemed feeble though well-intentioned. However, instead of taking the rest he said he required, Dickens took off for America on a lecture tour. At his return he wrote up his travel notes and letters into <span class="italic">American Notes</span> (October 1842). Though the book went through four editions before the end of the year, it was not considered by Dickens or his publishers notably successful. The serial novel that Dickens commenced immediately afterwards, <span class="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</span> (January 1843&#150;July 1844), fell victim both to a downturn in the economy and to the four-year hiatus since Dickens's last monthly. When it became clear that the profits from <span class="italic">Chuzzlewit</span> would not pay off the advances, in June 1843 Hall hinted that it might be necessary to invoke a clause in the agreement of 7 September 1841 reducing by &pound;50 the &pound;200 monthly stipend Dickens received for writing each instalment. Dickens was so irritated he could not write. &#145;I am bent upon paying Chapman and Hall <i>down</i>&#146;, he told Forster. &#145;And when I have done that, Mr. Hall shall have a piece of my mind&#146;  (ibid., 3.517). First he tried to work off the balance by publishing a short holiday gift, <span class="italic">A Christmas Carol</span> (19 December 1843). He insisted that Chapman and Hall take nothing but a commission on sales, but then he spent so much on binding and hand-coloured illustrations that, at the retail price of 5<i>s</i>. he specified, there was very little in the way of profit to divide in spring 1844. Dickens severed relations. However, he believed that Chapman and Hall understood the business of serial publishing better than the printers, Bradbury and Evans, whom he asked to be his new publishers. Moreover, Chapman and Hall owned a share in most of his copyrights. Consequently Dickens continued to receive accounts from, and plan republications with, the firm, which co-published <span class="italic">The Chimes</span> (16 December 1844) and was considered though not chosen by a nervous Dickens as publisher for <span class="italic">Dombey and Son</span> (October 1846&#150;April 1848).<br>
<br>Hall fell ill suddenly and died at the firm's office at 186 Strand, London, on Sunday, 7 March 1847, aged forty-six. Dickens, having ascertained from Chapman that his presence at the funeral would be acceptable, attended the burial at Highgate cemetery &#145;to pay that last mark of respect&#146;. Hall &#145;had a good little wife, if ever a man had,&#146; he wrote afterwards to H. K. Browne, who did not attend; the &#145;accounts of her tending of him at the last, are deeply affecting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Charles Dickens</span>, 5.36).<br>
