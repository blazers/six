<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dexter,  John Henry</span>  (1925&#150;1990), <span class="occ">theatre director</span>, was born on 2 August 1925 in Derby, the only child of Harry Dexter, plumber, and his wife, Rosanne Smith. There were music, painting, and home theatricals in the family, but Dexter's only formal education was at the local elementary school (Reginald Street), which he left at the age of fourteen. He then took a factory job before joining the army as a national serviceman. Not having attended a university was a source of lifelong regret, particularly as his entry into the professional theatre coincided with the rise of the graduate director. For the same reason he developed into a compulsive autodidact, a passionate scholar of stage history who never undertook a classical text without exhaustive research. His career began at the Derby Playhouse, in a company that also included John Osborne. Osborne recommended Dexter to the English Stage Company's artistic director, George Devine, who engaged him in 1957 as an associate director. Dexter had no previous directing experience, but he rapidly gained it at the Royal Court Theatre in London, which he subsequently described as his university; there he forged relationships with working-class writers, notably Michael Hastings and Arnold Wesker. At the same time he formed his long alliance with the designer Jocelyn Herbert, crucially in the 1959 production of Wesker's <span class="italic">The Kitchen</span>, an elaborately choreographed show on a defiantly undecorated stage, where even the lighting rig was exposed to the audience. This marked the beginning of the text-centred, visually austere style which was to become his trademark.<br>
<br>At the Royal Court, Dexter gained a double reputation: as an electrifying animator of spectacle and crowd movement, and as a &#145;playwright's director&#146; who could spot not only the defects of a script but also the hidden potential, and coax the writer into achieving it. The success of his subsequent partnership with Peter Shaffer (<span class="italic">The Royal Hunt of the Sun</span>, 1964; <span class="italic">Black Comedy</span>, 1966; <span class="italic">Equus</span>, 1973) depended as much on pre-rehearsal textual analysis as on the physical staging.<br>
<br>In 1963 Dexter left the Royal Court to become assistant director to Laurence Olivier at the National Theatre when it was in its honeymoon phase. He began widening his range with productions of <span class="italic">Saint Joan</span> (1963), <span class="italic">Hobson's Choice</span> (1964), and Olivier's <span class="italic">Othello</span> (1964), shows that went lastingly into public memory. He also began another fertile partnership with the poet Tony Harrison, whose versions of Moli&egrave;re and Racine (<span class="italic">The Misanthrope</span>, 1973, and <span class="italic">Phaedra Britannica</span>, 1975) set a dazzling new standard for creative translation.<br>
<br>By the late 1960s Dexter was building a parallel career as a director of opera&#151;a natural move, given his flair as an animator and his innate musicality (coupled with his temporary withdrawal from the National Theatre following disagreements with Olivier). His first venture, Berlioz's <span class="italic">Benvenuto Cellini</span> at Covent Garden (1966), was untypically ornate; but with Verdi's <span class="italic">I vespri siciliani</span> at the Hamburg State Opera three years later he declared himself in a production of characteristically austere magnificence. Staged on Josef Svoboda's gigantic staircase between two vast watch-towers, the production carried his name round the world as a new force on the operatic scene; and although he maintained his connection with Hamburg until 1973 (his production of Verdi's <span class="italic">Un ballo in maschera</span>), the main focus of his work during the 1970s was at New York's Metropolitan Opera House, where he was appointed director of productions in 1974. Dexter saw the Metropolitan as a Babylonian anachronism, and he made it his mission to drag it into the twentieth century through simplified staging, technical reform, and enlargement of repertory. Against the odds he won over the conservative public with a series of non-standard works, from Meyerbeer's <span class="italic">Le proph&egrave;te</span> and Poulenc's <span class="italic">Les dialogues des Carm&eacute;lites</span> (both 1977) to <span class="italic">Parade</span> (1981), a French triptych which he assembled from Satie, Poulenc, and Ravel. By this time, however, his relationship had soured with the Metropolitan's administration and its musical director, James Levine, and during the early 1980s he returned to freelance work.<br>
<br>Dexter continued to direct major productions in London and New York, but he never achieved his ambition of running a house and company of his own; and his final attempt to do so&#151;with a classically based West End troupe&#151;fell apart after its opening production of T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Cocktail Party</span> (Phoenix Theatre, 1986).<br>
<br>Dexter was a stocky figure of medium height, with chubby features and a domed head that became increasingly prominent as he lost his hair. He had a biting tongue which could wound actors and alienate patrons; he also suffered from declining health, due to diabetes and the aftermath of youthful polio, before his final heart attack. He was a homosexual and suffered a brief term of imprisonment for homosexuality in the 1950s. A collection of his writings, <span class="italic">The Honourable Beast: a Posthumous Autobiography</span>, was published by his friend Riggs O'Hara in 1993. Dexter died on 23 March 1990 in London, following a heart operation.<br>
