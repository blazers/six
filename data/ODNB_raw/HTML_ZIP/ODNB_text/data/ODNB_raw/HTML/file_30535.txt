<span class="headword">Bain, Sir  Frederick William</span>  (1889&#150;1950), <span class="occ">chemist and industrialist</span>, was born on 22 March 1889 at Macduff, Banffshire, the son of James Bain, agent for the Macduff Commercial Company, and his wife, Isabella Strachan. Educated at the Banff Academy, he was only seventeen when the death of his father put an end to his hopes of a university career. He moved with his mother and younger sister to Aberdeen, where he worked for a company distributing fertilizers and in his spare time attended chemistry classes at the university. In 1915 he went to Flanders as company quartermaster sergeant in the 4th (territorial) battalion of Gordon Highlanders, which he had joined in 1908.<br>
<br>He soon received his commission, was mentioned in dispatches, and awarded the MC for gallantry, but on Christmas day 1915 he was severely wounded and lost his left arm in a bomb accident. Upon his recovery he entered the Ministry of Munitions, and soon became deputy director in the section of the trench warfare supply department which was responsible for the supply of materials for chemical warfare.<br>
<br>When the war ended Bain found himself without a job and handicapped by illness. By chance he met Christopher Clayton of the United Alkali Company and he went with him to Liverpool as his personal assistant. He was soon a director of the company and on the formation of Imperial Chemical Industries in 1926 he entered the new combine with enthusiasm, becoming vice-chairman, in 1931, and later chairman, of the general chemicals group. He became an executive manager of ICI in 1939, a director in 1940, and a deputy chairman in 1945, an appointment which he held until his death.<br>
<br>Between 1941 and 1944 Bain was seconded to the Ministry of Supply as chairman of the Chemical Control Board, and he was also chairman of the chemical planning committee of the Ministry of Production (1942&#150;4). For these services he was knighted in 1945. After the war he was one of the most active presidents (1947&#150;9) the Federation of British Industries has ever known. He was a member of innumerable committees and councils, including that of the Society of Chemical Industry, and one of his particular interests was the Association of British Chemical Manufacturers, of which he was for several years vice-chairman and of which he was made an honorary member and honorary vice-president shortly before he died.<br>
<br>Although Bain had studied chemistry he made no claim to be a chemist. The knowledge he had acquired was nevertheless invaluable to him in the career which he made for himself. With typical courage, undaunted by his small beginnings and his physical misfortune, he seized his slender opportunity and turned it to success. Hard work and natural ability played their part, but they were informed and vitalized by a tremendous zest for life, which enabled him to bring a cheerful enthusiasm to everything he undertook. He played as hard as he worked, for he had many gifts and wide interests. He loved plays and poetry, and good talk of an evening with his friends, when he could always prove himself the master in any argument over Burns, Milton, or Shakespeare. Those friends were many, for &#145;Freddy's&#146; cheerful and generous personality was magnetic. Informal and eminently approachable, he had a remarkable memory for names and a gift for leadership, which was never more happily exercised than in his devoted work for Toc H, particularly in Lancashire where he was a pioneer of the movement. Social work, politics (he was always a staunch Liberal), and the repertory theatre also claimed his vigorous attention while he was in Liverpool. In later years he travelled widely on business and at the time of his death he was one of the joint chairmen of the Anglo-American Council of Productivity. He was everywhere welcome and respected, but he received no recognition which he valued more than the honorary LLD of the University of Aberdeen awarded in 1950.<br>
<br>On 4 October 1921 Bain married Isabel Margaret Adeline, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30332/', "J. G. Adami")</script>, vice-chancellor of the University of Liverpool. They had one son, after whose birth his wife unfortunately suffered almost continuously from ill health until her death in 1945.<br>
<br>Bain died in Westminster Hospital, London, on 23 November 1950, as the result of a fall on 14 November, which might have been insignificant had he not lacked an arm to save himself.<br>
