<span class="headword">Grissell,  Thomas</span>  (1801&#150;1874), <span class="occ">public works contractor</span>, was born on 4 October 1801 at Stockwell, Surrey, the eldest of the nine children of Thomas De la Garde Grissell (1778&#150;1847) of the East India Company's service, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1847), daughter of James Peto of Godalming, Surrey. He was educated at St Paul's School, London, with the intention of his entering the medical profession, but in 1815 Grissell was articled to his uncle Henry Peto, perhaps at that time the country's principal public works contractor (his partner having died the previous year). Ten years later, when the collapse of part of his work on the London custom house discredited Peto, Grissell was admitted partner. On his uncle's death in 1830 he succeeded to a half share in the business and estate, together with his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22042/', "Samuel Morton Peto")</script>, who married Grissell's sister Mary. In the highly competitive building world of the 1830s their business rapidly secured a position as the leading public works contractor. Grissell's business ethos was summed up in his motto &#145;Press forward&#146;.<br>
<br>Grissell and Peto ran a vertically integrated business, controlling all operations from stone quarrying to the provision of fittings for their buildings, and employing a highly disciplined workforce under capable foremen; this enabled them to exploit the advantages of the system of lump-sum contracting then coming into vogue. Grissell claimed to have introduced important innovations in building technique also, such as the use of the &#145;whole timber&#146; scaffolding, braced and bolted, that could support a travelling crane powered by a steam engine. The partners obtained the commission for Charles Barry's Birmingham grammar school (1833&#150;5), and then in London that for Hungerford market at &pound;42,400, which proved very remunerative. Nelson's Column, the Reform, Conservative, and Oxford and Cambridge clubs, and Clerkenwell Prison followed, as well as a number of churches. They built the Lyceum Theatre in sixteen weeks, and the St James's in ten. The large breweries and fire offices provided regular work, and the partners netted an average &pound;11,000&#150;&pound;12,000 per annum on a capital of &pound;50,000.<br>
<br>They also engaged in the new field of railway construction, undertaking part of the Great Western Railway, including the Hanwell Viaduct, much of the South Eastern Railway, and extensive works under Robert Stephenson, as well as improvements in the Severn navigation under the civil engineer William Cubitt. However, according to Peto, Grissell &#145;did not like the risks involved in the large railway undertakings, which needed large capital&#146;, so when the partnership was dissolved on 2 March 1846 he took over &#145;the building business, saw-mills, and premises&#146;, and the Severn contract, a stock-in-trade and plant that Peto calculated at &pound;150,000, &#145;including houses built and building for the firm&#146; (presumably on a speculative basis), &#145;and, besides, he will have a large and <i>abundant</i> capital in money&#146;  (Peto, 13, 16).<br>
<br>Most notably, however, the firm had won successive contracts for the new Houses of Parliament between 1839 and 1850, work supervised entirely by Grissell, and from 1846 in his sole name. The first two contracts, for the river front, were lump-sum, but subsequently the architect, Charles Barry, recommended that further contracts should be based on a schedule of prices. Grissell leased quarries for Cornish granite and for the Anston stone employed for the facing, and successfully contended with a serious masons' strike in 1841, caused by the relentless regime of his foreman. But in 1845, with more than a thousand of his men on site, he sought to terminate his contract for woodwork because it was financially unsatisfactory: Barry calculated that an upward revision of prices would still yield only eight or nine per cent profit. Signature of the revised contract was to be long delayed because Grissell was unwilling to accept responsibility for fire risk&#151;a serious consideration since work was being pressed on by candlelight&#151;and objected to the architect's attempt to control the subcontracting habitual in the traditional craft organization of the industry. (Even Grissell's highly integrated building service could not embrace trades of which he seldom had need, ironwork in particular being subcontracted to his nephew at the Regent's Canal ironworks.) By the end of 1851, Grissell found his prices barely remunerative for the &#145;most unusual and elaborate work&#146;, with its &#145;extraordinary quality of the workmanship&#146;  (TNA: PRO, WORK 11/6/5, fol. 91), but the office of works none the less believed it might be executed more cheaply (and secured a 30 per cent reduction from a new contractor), so that to Grissell's disappointment he was unable to complete the Houses of Parliament. As associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1843 (when he was also elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries), Grissell served on its council in 1845, and in 1846 constructed at cost a lecture room for the institution to T. H. Wyatt's designs.<br>
<br>Few of the architects who employed him could live on the scale achieved by Grissell. From about 1847 he lived at 19 Kensington Palace Gardens, one of a pair of mansions designed in Barry's office and built by Grissell's own firm using surplus stone from the Houses of Parliament; he employed a domestic staff of nine, including two footmen. In 1850 he bought Norbury Park, a Georgian estate in Surrey (which he was to entail on his descendants), and commenced life as a country gentleman and county magistrate, becoming high sheriff in 1854. He also held a directorate of the Western Life Office.<br>
<br>Grissell's first wife, Sarah Bensley, whom he married on 8 May 1825, died in childbirth in 1829, leaving two sons surviving; two years later, on 2 April 1831, he married Eliza (1798&#150;1863), daughter of John Marklow and widow of John Sheen, with whom he had four more sons, two of whom died young: Hartwell (1839&#150;1907) became a Roman Catholic and chamberlain of honour to the Pope. Grissell, a keen upholder of his family connections, bequeathed as heirlooms for Norbury Park a number of paintings and sculptures by Italian and English masters, including his own portrait by Henry William Pickersgill. In his last years he altered bequests to some of his children in no fewer than eight codicils to his will. He died at Norbury Park on 26 May 1874 and was buried in Mickleham, Surrey. Among his legacies were &pound;5000 to his nephew Henry Peto (son of his late partner), &pound;1000 for a new Anglican church nearby at West Humble and &pound;250 to the Institute of British Architects to fund a medal for the best set of drawings in constructive architecture by a young architect.<br>
