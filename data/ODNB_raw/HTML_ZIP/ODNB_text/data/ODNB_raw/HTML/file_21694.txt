<span class="headword">Peard,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1594, <em>d.</em> 1644/5), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was baptized on 28 July 1594, eldest child of John Peard (<i>bap</i>. 1565, <i>d</i>. 1631), mayor of Barnstaple, and his wife, Julian (<i>d</i>. 1642), daughter of Roger Beaple, merchant of Barnstaple. He had four brothers and six sisters. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 23 June 1613 and called to the bar on 30 June 1620. Barnstaple retained him as one of its counsel from 1628 and he practised in both Devon and London. He was unmarried and lived with his mother when he was in Barnstaple, where both of them refused to pay ship money in 1639.<br>
<br>Peard was appointed deputy recorder of Barnstaple in 1640 and represented the town in parliament. He attended almost daily in the Short Parliament and spoke frequently, especially against ship money, which he termed an abomination. He traced the historical background of the principle of no taxation without representation and argued that the judges overstepped their function in their decisions on it. In the Long Parliament he continued his attacks on ship money and the judges, especially Lord Keeper Finch, and was commissioned by the Commons to examine whether pressure had been put upon the judges by the crown. Over religious affairs he was outspoken against the recent canons, especially the etcetera oath, and was on the Commons committee to prepare the charges against Archbishop Laud. He was one of Pym's close supporters and moved to have the charges brought against Strafford, a motion Pym seconded. Later he was chairman of the grand committee of the house for the bill of attainder against Strafford when, with the doors locked, he reported on the result of the division. Peard was among the originators of the protestation and in December 1641 proposed the printing of the grand remonstrance.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of civil war Peard received the permission of the Commons to remain in Barnstaple, where he organized the fortifications and contributed to their cost. He was on the town's council of war, meeting daily in the guildhall, and had become the recorder by 30 May 1643. After the royalist success at Stratton some citizens of the besieged city of Exeter opened negotiations with the commissioners of the royal army and these were extended to include Barnstaple. Propositions were sent to the council of war at Barnstaple but suppressed on Peard's advice. When news of this leaked out thirty-six leading citizens wrote to the mayor and council of war to demand a town meeting to consider them. This was rejected on Peard's motion and the letter burned by the hangman. Now some members of the corporation sought terms and reassurances from Prince Maurice and only &#145;the petulancy of Master Peard (that prudent, learned and comely Gentleman)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Aulicus</span>, 29 Aug 1643) delayed Barnstaple's surrender, which was agreed on 2 September. Peard still advised resistance and fomented opposition, which led to his arrest and imprisonment in Exeter. He became very ill and died in Barnstaple some time between 9 June 1644, when he added a codicil to his will, and 15 March 1645, when Richard Beaple's will was proved. He was buried in St Peter's, Barnstaple.<br>
