<span class="headword">Wilkes,  Richard</span>  (1691&#150;1760), <span class="occ">physician and antiquary</span>, the eldest of the three sons of Richard Wilkes (1666&#150;1740/41), and Lucretia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Astley (<i>c</i>.1670&#150;1717), of Wood Eaton, Staffordshire, was born at Willenhall, Staffordshire, on 16 March 1691. The family, originally from Hertfordshire, had lived in Staffordshire for three centuries. Wilkes was educated at Trentham and at Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, and entered St John's College, Cambridge, on 13 March 1710, gaining a BA in January 1714 and an MA three years later. He was elected a fellow of St John's on 21 January 1717; he resigned on 23 March 1723. At Cambridge he attended the mathematics lectures of Nicholas Saunderson, to whose <span class="italic">Algebra</span> he contributed a memoir in 1740. In 1718 Wilkes was chosen as Linacre lecturer at the college. Briefly in deacon's orders at Stow by Chartley, Staffordshire, he failed to secure a living and began practising medicine at Wolverhampton on 12 February 1720. There is no evidence of his having an MD degree.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1725 Wilkes married an heiress, Rachel (1695&#150;1756), the eldest daughter of Rowland Manlove of Abbots Bromley, and moved to the Wilkes family estate of some 450 acres at Willenhall. His father had built their house, the Old Hall, on the Walsall Road; it was demolished in 1934. Wilkes's younger brother John was already practising there as a surgeon; his sister Anne committed suicide in 1744. As a physician, Wilkes kept detailed patient case notes; he also wrote a diary, too personal to have been intended for publication, of which the first and second volumes have survived, although the county antiquarian, Stebbing Shaw, referred to a third volume, now apparently lost. Wilkes was actively involved in founding a chapel of ease at Willenhall in 1748, and was chapel warden there until his death; he was also a trustee of the town's workhouse. He owned the Wolverhampton waterworks, and in 1750 actively promoted the healing qualities of the springs at Willenhall, long reputed for eye and skin conditions, having already carried out his own experiments on the mineral waters.<br>
<br>Rachel Wilkes died in May 1756 and on 9 October Wilkes remarried; his second bride was Frances (1711&#150;1798), widow of Heigham Bendish (1680&#150;1723), a former Essex physician, and sister of the Revd Sir Richard Wrottesley, head of the leading local family. Wilkes was said to live in considerable state after this second marriage. Apart from his diaries, Wilkes wrote <span class="italic">A Treaty on Dropsy</span> (1730), <span class="italic">A letter to the gentlemen &hellip; of Staffordshire on the treatment of the distemper now prevalent among horned cattle</span> (1743), and <span class="italic">An Essay on the Smallpox</span> (1747). He is credited with creating an epitaph in Wolverhampton church for Claudius Phillips (<i>d</i>. 1732), a musician. He had wide antiquarian interests and wrote part of a history of Staffordshire, which Shaw incorporated in his own <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Staffordshire</span> (1798&#150;1802). Wilkes was also planning a new edition of Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>. When seriously ill in 1747 he wrote his own epitaph in eighteen rhyming couplets:<blockquote>
<div>Here, reader, stand awhile, and know<br>
</div>
<div>Whose carcase 'tis that rots below.<br>
</div>
<div>A Man's, who walk'd by Reason's rule,<br>
</div>
<div>Yet sometimes err'd and play'd the fool;<br>
</div>
<div>A Man's, sincere in all his ways,<br>
</div>
<div>And full of the Creator's praise;<br>
</div>
<div>Who laugh'd at Priestcraft, pride, and strife,<br>
</div>
<div>And all the little tricks of life.<br>
</div>
<div>He lov'd his king, his country more,<br>
</div>
<div>And dreadful party-rage forebore:<br>
</div>
<div>He told nobility the truth,<br>
</div>
<div>And wink'd at hasty slips of youth.<br>
</div>
<div>The honest poor man's steady friend,<br>
</div>
<div>The villain's scourge in hopes to mend.<br>
</div>
<div>His father, mother, children, wife,<br>
</div>
<div>His riches, honours, length of life,<br>
</div>
<div>Concern not thee. Observe what's here.<br>
</div>
<div>He rests in hope, and not in fear.<br>
</div> (S. Shaw, <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of Staffordshire</span>, 2.148)</blockquote>Wilkes's journals describe many of his experiments, as well as showing his considerable scientific and antiquarian interests. They are of particular value, however, as a record of his patients, therapies, and professional acquaintances across the midlands. His patients ranged from the local gentry (the Vernons of Sudbury, the Leveson-Gowers of Trentham) to the poorest, whom he treated for the medical interest of their symptoms, many described in great detail. One patient criticized him as &#145;little lamented but for his judgment in physick. He was without doubt a good physician but no charity&#146;  (Wyndham, 1.170), and he twice refused to attend William Shenstone's dying brother.<br>
<br>Wilkes had been visiting patients in Wolverhampton on the day he died, 6 March 1760, in Willenhall, apparently from &#145;a Return of the Gout in his Stomach&#146;  (<span class="italic">Aris's Birmingham Gazette</span>, 10 March 1760), and was buried on 20 March at St Giles, Willenhall, where a monument was erected in 1800. He died a very wealthy man. Both marriages were childless and by his will, made on 22 February 1759, the estate was to pass eventually after his wife's death to his cousin, the Revd Thomas Unett (1732&#150;1785) of Stafford. Frances Wilkes made her will in 1784, having won a chancery lawsuit with Thomas Unett over the estate. She died at Froxfield, Hampshire, on 24 December 1798.<br>
