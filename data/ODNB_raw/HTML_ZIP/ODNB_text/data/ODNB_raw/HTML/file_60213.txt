<span class="headword">McLellan,  Robert</span>  (1907&#150;1985), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born at Kirkfieldbank in Lanarkshire on 28 January 1907, the son of John McLellan, a compositor, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hannah. His maternal grandparents had a fruit farm in the Clyde valley, where he spent many childhood holidays and which provided the background for the short stories collected under the title <span class="italic">Linmill</span> (1977). McLellan attended secondary school in Bearsden, a well-to-do suburb to the north of Glasgow, but his university studies in philosophy were cut short by a bout of ill health, and he never completed his degree.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1938 McLellan married Kathleen Heys (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), whom he had met while leading summer climbs in the Lake District, and settled with her in a cottage at High Corrie on the island of Arran in the Firth of Clyde, where he remained for the rest of his life. They had two children, Kathleen and John. From the time that he moved to Arran, McLellan supported himself by his writing, something which has proved very difficult in Scotland unless the individual concerned has been able to achieve success beyond his or her native land. As to the apparent remoteness of his home, and its distance from professional theatrical activity, McLellan commented in a magazine article: &#145;I can never be quite sure where the centre of things is &hellip; more often than not, though I keep the feeling to myself for fear of ridicule, it seems to be in High Corrie.&#146; He also felt that too close an involvement in the theatre &#145;can lead to a restricted view of human nature. Actors are, in no unkind sense of the word, a peculiar people&#146;  (McLellan, 35&#150;6).<br>
<br>The development of a Scottish dramatic tradition in the twentieth century was somewhat erratic. In the latter part of the nineteenth century the native element in the theatre north of the border consisted largely of adaptations of the novels of Walter Scott, of original pieces on other well-worn historical themes, and of music-hall sketches. But in the first years of the twentieth century the Glasgow Repertory Company (1909&#150;14), an organization funded by subscribing citizens of the city, offered apprentice Scottish dramatists the chance to expand their artistic horizons and to see their work alongside a range of contemporary playwrights. Several availed themselves of the opportunity, but by the time McLellan came to write the principal outlets for the indigenous dramatist in Scotland were a number of amateur companies, such as the Scottish National Players and the Curtain Theatre. From 1933 to 1940 the Curtain offered programmes, principally of new plays, in a converted drawing-room in the west end of Glasgow, and then in the small Lyric Theatre. In January 1934 it presented as one of a triple bill of one-act pieces McLellan's <span class="italic">Jeddart Justice</span>. This was followed by several other one-act plays and a number of full-length ones, including <span class="italic">Toom Byres</span> (1936) and <span class="italic">Jamie the Saxt</span> (1937). This latter piece is generally regarded as McLellan's finest work; the title role was originally played by Duncan Macrae, a Scottish actor of distinction who, like so many of his generation, came into the professional theatre via the amateur one. Nevertheless, McLellan always had reservations about Macrae's approach to the part, reservations which were heightened when the piece was revived in 1956 as part of a season of mainly Scottish plays in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and the actor cut speeches wholesale in order to secure the comic effects at which he had become so adept.<br>
<br>The founding of professional repertory theatres in Scotland during and after the Second World War provided McLellan and others of his generation with opportunities that had not been available to them in their native land until that point. Unlike O. H. Mavor (James Bridie), whose wit and urbanity suited audiences outside Scotland, McLellan wrote in a form of lowland Scots that does not travel very well, and so the West End route which Bridie pursued with alacrity was not open to him. McLellan was adamant throughout his career that the Scots he employed had none of the artifice of the Lallans found in the poetry of C. M. Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid), but stemmed from the variety of the language he had heard as a child growing up on the edge of rural lowland Scotland. Ruefully McLellan recalled that whenever he had a success on the stage he was encouraged to write in English, something he did not wish to do. Indeed, it is striking that, when he does employ both languages, for instance in plays such as <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span> or <span class="italic">Young Auchinleck</span>, the passages in Scots move with vivacity, while the English ones tend to limp along. Given McLellan's linguistic position, the appearance in his own country of a number of theatres which were actively seeking plays by indigenous writers was absolutely crucial to the later development of his writing. Indeed, he was associated with most of the important companies in Scotland in the period immediately after the war: Glasgow Unity Theatre premi&egrave;red <span class="italic">Torwatletie</span> in 1946 and <span class="italic">The Flouers o' Edinburgh</span> in 1948, the Glasgow Citizens' staged <span class="italic">Mary Stewart</span> in 1951, and Edinburgh Gateway gave <span class="italic">Young Auchinleck</span> its first performance in 1962. McLellan continued to work as a dramatist until 1967, when <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span> was presented by the Royal Lyceum Company in Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Of McLellan's plays the two which have been most frequently revived are <span class="italic">Jamie the Saxt</span> and <span class="italic">The Flouers o' Edinburgh</span>. The continued popularity of these pieces is easy to explain. One presents a most appealing picture of James VI as a very canny individual, who skilfully outwits those who seek to undermine his position at the Scottish court, then reaps his reward in the shape of the prospect of the throne in England. The other explores the issue of Scottish identity through a dramatization of the controversy which arose in the post-Union Edinburgh of the eighteenth century as to whether people with serious social aspirations should abandon their &#145;barbarous&#146; native tongue in favour of English; this issue and related aspects of national consciousness are hardy perennials in the Scottish context.<br>
<br>Most of McLellan's plays are historical dramas, and his few forays into the modern world&#151;such as the early <span class="italic">Portrait of an Artist</span> (the Curtain, 1939), which is set in &#145;bohemian&#146; Glasgow, and <span class="italic">The Road to the Isles</span> (Glasgow Citizens', 1954), which tries to engage with the problem of highland regeneration&#151;are not successful. McLellan is at his happiest and most effective when he is recreating Scotland's past: he once offered the view that he was, in a sense, writing some of the plays which would have been written if Scotland had continued to have a vigorous drama after the departure of the court for London in 1603, and if the depredations visited on the theatre by the Presbyterian reformers had never taken place. For the most part McLellan's view of Scotland's past is devoid of the sentimentality and nostalgia which have permeated Scottish culture: even in comedy, violence and sudden death are never very far away. McLellan's great strength, however, is in the creation of lively action and of character. He was particularly concerned, as he saw it, to &#145;fix&#146; in dramatic form aspects of the Scottish character which he considered to be important, and in this he is often very successful.<br>
<br>McLellan's skilled use of the Scots language to create character on the stage is paralleled by its employment to suggest particular place and circumstance in much of his occasional verse, but particularly in the stories republished as <span class="italic">Linmill</span>, many of which were originally written to be broadcast on BBC radio. McLellan also produced a popular guide to his adopted home, <span class="italic">The Isle of Arran</span> (1976). He took an active part in the affairs of the community: he was a member of Arran district council for a number of years and became chairman of the Association of District Councils of Scotland, the body which represented these second-tier authorities prior to local government reorganization in 1975. He was made an OBE in 1978. McLellan died at his home in Arran on 27 January 1985 of a cerebral haemorrhage, and was buried in Sannox cemetery on the island on 30 January.<br>
<br>There is a certain heroism about McLellan's dogged pursuit of what he saw as his proper path as a dramatist, despite the meagre financial returns and the limited number of productions of his work. It is perfectly understandable that he chose to do what he knew he could do best, but it is none the less a matter of regret that in his writing his engagement with the modern world is oblique rather than direct.<br>
