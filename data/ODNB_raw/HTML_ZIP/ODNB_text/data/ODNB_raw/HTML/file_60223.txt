<span class="headword">Alexander,  Walter</span>  (1879&#150;1959), <span class="occ">bus operator</span>, was born on 2 May 1879 at Bonnybridge, Falkirk, son of Robert Alexander, a carter, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stirling. In 1902 the family opened a general store at Camelon, near Falkirk, which also sold, hired, and repaired bicycles. In 1913 Walter bought a chain-driven Belhaven lorry, which was used in the cartage business during the week and, by substituting a charabanc body, carried passengers at the weekend. A second Belhaven was acquired in 1916.<br>
<br>Alexander married Isabella Daly in 1898 at Falkirk. They had at least one son, also called Walter. <a name="cosubject_60223"></a><span class="headword">Walter Alexander</span>  (1902&#150;1979) was born at Bonnybridge on 16 February 1902, left school at fourteen and joined his father in the business. When their first bus was obtained in 1919 he drove it on an extension of the Falkirk&#150;Bonnybridge route to Kilsyth. Tours were advertised, and a private party was taken on an extended tour to John o' Groats in 1920; probably this was the first time a charabanc had made the journey.<br>
<br>The family shop was sold in 1921, and by the time the business was incorporated in 1924 the two men were in full partnership. They were more like brothers than father and son. By 1928 the fleet had grown to more than 100 vehicles, and services reached Glasgow and Aberdeen, with a co-ordination agreement with the Scottish Motor Traction company (SMT) between Perth and Dundee. A coach building works was established at Stirling (removed to Falkirk in 1959).<br>
<br>After the main-line railway companies obtained road powers in 1928 a considerable consolidation of bus company ownership took place in Scotland. The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), invested in SMT, which, while remaining an operator, became a holding company, among its interests being a two-thirds share in W. Alexander &amp; Sons Ltd. In the more settled market of the 1930s the Alexanders were able to expand further (taking over some SMT services in the process), and when the SMT group was sold to the British Transport Commission in January 1949 roughly half its fleet of more than 5000 vehicles were in Alexander's &#145;Bluebird&#146; livery; a famous emblem in Scotland, still to be seen there.<br>
<br>Father and son Alexander continued to serve on the board of Scottish Omnibuses Ltd, the state-owned holding company, the older man until his death. His son joined the board of the successor Scottish Transport Group in 1969, and retired in 1971. They were not alone among the founders of the Scottish bus industry in making this transition to public ownership while remaining in control. They bought out the coach building side of the business in 1948, and formed Walter Alexander &amp; Co. (Coachbuilders) Ltd, which became one of the largest bodybuilding firms in the UK.<br>
<br>Walter Alexander, senior, was a JP, and a football enthusiast, becoming chairman of Falkirk FC in 1951. After the death of his first wife he married on 2 October 1936 Clarissa May Brookes and thirdly, on 12 December 1953, Anne Cooper Elder, or Strachan, who survived him. He died of heart failure at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 19 June 1959. His son, who had married Katherine Mary Turnbull, died after a stroke at the family home, Solsgirth House, near Dollar, on 5 March 1979. There is no doubt that the contribution of the two men, through what remained almost a family business for so long, was of outstanding value to travellers in Scotland, from the midlands to Inverness.<br>
