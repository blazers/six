<span class="headword">Fragson,  Harry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>L&eacute;on Philippe Pot]</span>  (1869&#150;1913), <span class="occ">singer and songwriter</span>, was born at 4 Old Compton Street, London, on 2 July 1869, the son of Victor Pot (<i>c</i>.1832&#150;1914), a French hotel-keeper, and his Belgian cook, L&eacute;ontine Winand (<i>d</i>. 1907). During the 1870s his father took up the business of yeast merchant, seemingly dividing his time between London and Antwerp, Belgium, while young Philippe was educated at a board school in England. Inspired by the visit of French music-hall singer Paulus to London in 1889, he sought to launch a career of his own, by singing to his piano accompaniment, at the Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane. The reception was inauspicious, and instead he sought better luck in Paris with an English persona and the name Harry Fragson&#151;the surname derived with thin disguise from &#145;Frog's son&#146;<br>
<br>With much use of Parisian slang and inimitable facial distortions, he gradually built up success. Soon known in France by the single name Fragson, he secured engagements at the Cabaret de la Butte (later the Cabaret des Quat'z'Arts), as well as other Montmartre night-spots such as the music hall La Cigale and the Chat-Noir. He toured France and in time gained engagements at all the major Paris music halls, as well as in many of the finest drawing rooms. From 1902 he was also engaged at the Folies Berg&egrave;re in annual editions of the <span class="italic">Revue des Folies Berg&egrave;re</span>, which required him to extend his performances to encompass character parts. Then, in 1904, he was seen by Arthur Collins, manager of London's Drury Lane Theatre, and invited to appear in the following year's Christmas pantomime. As a Frenchified servant Dandigny in <span class="italic">Cinderella</span>, and performing some of his own song compositions, he created a sensation. For the next few years he was able to divide his time between England and France, earning the description &#145;L'Entente cordiale comedian&#146;.<br>
<br>From 1902 to 1906 Fragson made recordings of many of his French songs for issue on cylinders and discs. Most were of his own composition, notably the waltzes &#145;Les blondes&#146; and &#145;Les jaloux&#146;, simple melodies providing context for his comic patter. In 1909, 1912, and 1913 he added recordings of many of his English songs too, some little more than verbal patter to vamped accompaniment, and some of them English versions of French originals. The original English-language compositions include such titles as &#145;The Employment Agency&#146; (1908), &#145;Billy Brown&#146; (1908), &#145;The Other Department, Please!&#146; (1910), and &#145;The Music Hall Shakespeare&#146; (1912). Most significant of his later French creations was &#145;Reviens!&#146; (&#145;Come Back to Me!&#146;; 1910), which has an intensity of passion quite missing elsewhere, and which has survived as a standard number for French entertainers. In 1912 he also appeared with Max Linder in a fourteen-minute comedy film, <span class="italic">Max et l'entente cordiale</span>.<br>
<br>Most important of Fragson's English compositions is, however, &#145;Hello! Hello! Who's Your Lady Friend?&#146;, a chorus song designed for audience participation. He recorded it around October 1913, also introducing it to audiences while on tour in Sheffield. After then performing it at the Finsbury Park Empire and London Coliseum in November 1913, he returned to Paris for what would prove the last time.<br>
<br>Following L&eacute;ontine Winand's death in 1907, Fragson and his father had lived together in an apartment at 56 rue Lafayette, Paris. Fragson himself never married but seemingly had many sexual liaisons, notably with singing actresses &Egrave;ve Lavalli&egrave;re and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40922/', "Alice Delysia (1889&#150;1979)")</script>, the latter of whom was presented to London in 1912 as Mrs Fragson. They were followed in 1913 by a Marseille girl, Paulette Franck, in a relationship that caused much friction between father and son, aggravated by suggestions that the aged father should enter a home while Fragson toured Britain. After dining on 30 December 1913, Fragson returned home around 8.30 p.m. prior to appearing at the Alhambra Music Hall. On arrival at his apartment he was shot in the head by his father. He was rushed to the Lariboisi&egrave;re Hospital, but died there shortly before midnight. The funeral on 3 January 1914, before his burial in Montmartre cemetery, reduced much of Paris to a standstill. Victor Pot was arrested and detained but, suffering from diabetes, died on 17 February 1914 before he could be tried.<br>
<br>Even if Fragson's public profile was heightened by the circumstances of his death, he was in his own right a top-ranked performer&#151;for only eight years in Britain, but for over twenty in France. Musically self-taught, he had an impeccable musical memory. His audiences appreciated his natural ability at the piano allied to a rich, mellow high-baritone voice, clear enunciation and a highly eccentric personality, with a great gift for mimicry and a strong sense of the ridiculous. He left enduring songs in the popular repertory of both countries in which he starred.<br>
