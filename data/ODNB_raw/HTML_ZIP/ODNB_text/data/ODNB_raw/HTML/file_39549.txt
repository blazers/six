<span class="headword">White,  Beatrice Mary Irene</span>  (1902&#150;1986), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, was born on 6 July 1902 at 20 Staff Houses, Ely, Cambridgeshire, the youngest of the three children of Robert Joseph White (1867&#150;1951) and Beatrice Mary Louisa Barnard (1872&#150;1949). At the time of her birth her father was a sergeant-major serving with the 4th Suffolk regiment, and the family was living in army accommodation.<br>
<br>Beatrice White entered King's College, London, in 1919 and was awarded a BA in English with first-class honours in 1923. She remained at King's College and in 1926 gained her MA (with distinction) for a thesis entitled &#145;A study of the <i>Eclogues</i>, life, and literary activities of Alexander Barclay&#146;. This research was conducted under the supervision of Professor A. W. Reed, to whom Beatrice dedicated her subsequent edition of Barclay's <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> (1928). She spent 1929&#150;31 in America, having been awarded a fellowship from the Commonwealth Fund to study at Stanford University and at the Henry E. Huntington Library in California.<br>
<br>On her return to London, White undertook editorial work for the Early English Text Society and the Shakespeare Association. In this early part of her scholarly career she published a number of works which established her reputation in the field of early Renaissance literature. For the Early English Text Society she edited Barclay's <span class="italic">Eclogues</span> (1928) and prepared <span class="italic">The vulgaria of John Stanbridge and the vulgaria of Robert Whittinton</span> (1932), an edition of two of the numerous school books which preceded Lily's Latin grammar. She also completed Florence Warren's edition of Lydgate's <span class="italic">The Dance of Death</span> (1931), work which had been disrupted by the First World War and Warren's death in 1917. In addition to these editorial achievements Beatrice White produced a study entitled <span class="italic">Mary Tudor</span> (1935), which sympathetically situated the queen's tragedy in the context of Mary's fidelity to outmoded loyalties. This attempt to correct the warped historical judgement of &#145;Bloody&#146; Mary was underpinned by an examination of contemporary documents and state papers, an approach which also characterized her slightly earlier volume <span class="italic">Royal Nonesuch: a Tudor Tapestry</span> (1933). These were White's principal publications, but she also wrote many articles on a range of medieval and early modern topics, and reviewed extensively in this area for journals such as <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span> and <span class="italic">Review of English Studies</span>. She described herself as a Tudor specialist who had been drawn into medieval literature by the obligation to teach it, but this modest self-assessment significantly downplays her contribution to medieval studies.<br>
<br>In 1936 White became a recognized teacher of the University of London, and in the same year she was appointed as a lecturer in English language and literature at Queen Mary College. In 1939 she took up a lectureship in the same subject at Westfield College, London, and it was here that she spent the rest of her professional career. Her appointment coincided with the college's temporary removal from London during the war (it was billeted at St Peter's, Oxford). Her links with the English Association also seem to have originated during this time. From 1940 to 1943 she covered the chapter on Restoration literature for <span class="italic">The Year's Work in English Studies</span> after the previous contributor was called away to a government post. Subsequently she took responsibility for the sections on nineteenth-century literature and (briefly) the chapter on Chaucer, before pressure of other work made her relinquish these contributions.<br>
<br>White was acting head of the English department at Westfield from 1944 to 1946, and in 1945 she was promoted to a readership. Other academic distinctions include the award of a DLitt from the University of London in 1947 on the strength of her publications, and election to fellowships of the Royal Society of Literature (1945), the Royal Historical Society (1947), and the Society of Antiquaries of London (1952). Her service to her discipline extended far beyond her own department. She was a member of several learned societies, including the Philological Society, the Viking Society, and the Folklore Society. She was president of the Medieval Society of the University of London from 1950 to 1954, and was chair of the board of examiners for the BA in English for the university from 1953 to 1956. She gave public lectures at universities in England and Germany, and at the conference of university professors of English in Paris in 1953. Most prestigiously, in 1956 she was the first woman to lecture to the Medieval Academy of America at Harvard University. She also served as external examiner for several British universities, and in 1956&#150;7 was visiting professor at Connecticut College for Women (USA). From 1961 to 1964 she was vice-principal of Westfield College, and in 1967 she became professor of English language and literature by conferment of title. She became emeritus professor following her retirement in 1969, and in 1976 was appointed an honorary fellow of the college.<br>
<br>In terms of research, the early modern court remained a source of fascination to White, as may be seen from her book <span class="italic">Cast of Ravens: the Strange Case of Sir Thomas Overbury</span> (1965), which reconstructed the events of an early seventeenth-century scandal at the court of James I, involving Overbury's death, apparently by poisoning, and the subsequent trial of the earl and countess of Somerset for his murder. Beatrice White also enjoyed a long career in the English Association. Most significantly she was the co-editor for four years, and the editor for ten, of its major annual bibliography, <span class="italic">The Year's Work in English Studies</span>. She became co-editor with Frederick S. Boas in 1952 (responsible for volumes 31&#150;4 for 1950&#150;53), and from 1956 she was its sole editor (volumes 35&#150;44 for 1954&#150;63), though benefiting from the assistance of T. S. Dorsch, who succeeded her as editor. In the preface to the 1964 volume Dorsch wrote of the expansion of <span class="italic">The Year's Work in English Studies</span> that occurred under White's editorship, and her response to its growth in size and scope: &#145;Dr White's scholarship has been equal to all the exacting demands made on it, and all who have worked with her have felt the benefit of her wise and benevolent guidance&#146;. She was also the collector of two issues of <span class="italic">Essays and Studies</span> (1962 and 1983), and a contributor to five other volumes; her own Festschrift, edited by T. S. Dorsch, appeared as part of this series in 1972. In addition she served on the association's executive council and on its publications committee, and was a trustee from about 1970.<br>
<br>Beatrice White never married, but surrounded herself with friends of all ages and from many different parts of the world. As a teacher she took a personal interest in her students, concerning herself with both their academic and their social welfare. She delighted in entertaining students and colleagues as well as friends, and enjoyed a reputation as a generous and vivacious hostess during her tenure at Westfield. After her retirement she made her home in Eastbourne, Sussex, occupying herself with interests which included reading, music, and painting; she also remained active as a scholar, continuing to publish academic essays until the mid-1980s. She died at 4 Abbotsrood, 1 Milnthorpe Road, Eastbourne, on 30 March 1986 after a long struggle with cancer and was buried in Hailsham, Sussex, on Monday 7 April.<br>
<br>After White's death the next published volume of <span class="italic">The Year's Work in English Studies</span> (actually no. 65 for 1984, published 1987), was dedicated to her. The English Association further honoured her memory by instituting an annual prize in her name, awarded for work in the field of English literature written before 1590. White's encouragement of more junior colleagues informed the remit of the prize as &#145;outstanding articles by, whenever possible, younger scholars&#146;.<br>
