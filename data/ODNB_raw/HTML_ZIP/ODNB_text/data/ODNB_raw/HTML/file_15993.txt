<span class="headword">Lane,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1600&#150;1630), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is of unknown parentage, though he may have been born in Somerset as this is the residence of at least three of his friends: Matthew Jefferies, master of choristers at Wells Cathedral, George Hancocke, and Sir Thomas Wyndham of Kentsford. Further, in <span class="italic">Tritons Trumpet</span> (1621) Lane contrasts his &#145;western <i>Poetrie</i>&#146; to &#145;eastern <i>Tussers</i> husbandry &hellip; as drewe fro <i>Somerset</i>, us to his queere&#146;. In the dedication to his 1616 continuation of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Squire's Tale</span> he relates that he has had no university education.<br>
<br>The earliest date for Lane is given in an aside by Anthony Wood in his note on a John Lane who died in 1578, where Wood adds that &#145;there was one John Lane, a poet, about this time&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.189). This would seem to place Lane as early as the 1570s, if Wood's secondhand recollection can be trusted. William Riley Parker discusses a number of John Lanes living during the first half of the seventeenth century  (Parker, 2.716), but there is no way to determine which is the subject of this article. In an entry in the Stationers' register, dated 23 June 1591, the title &#145;Tom Tell Trothe&#146; is included among a list of some ninety works granted to Thomas Orwyn which formerly belonged to Thomas Marshe, deceased. This could be Lane's book although the plain-speaking figure of Tom Tell-Truth appears throughout the Renaissance and the 1600 edition does not mention Orwyn. The first definite record of Lane is the book in question: <span class="italic">Tom Tell-Troths message and his pens complaint: a worke not unpleasant to be read, nor unprofitable to be followed</span> (1600). This work, which Lane calls &#145;the first fruites of my barren braine&#146;, is dedicated to George Dowse and consists of 120 six-line stanzas which enumerate the vices of England and lament the sorry state of the two universities.<br>
<br>The only other poem Lane published during his lifetime was <span class="italic">An Elegie upon the Death of the High and Renowned Princesse, our Late Soveraigne Elizabeth</span>, published in 1603. This work is listed in an April 1603 entry in the Stationers' register, with the provision that the bookseller John Deane &#145;gett Aucthoritie for yt&#146; before printing  (Arber, <span class="italic">Regs. Stationers</span>, 3.36). No further record of Lane appears until 2 March 1615, which is the date of an imprimatur by John Taverner in Lane's continuation of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Squire's Tale</span>  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Douce 170), one of three works Lane left in manuscript. The manuscript is dated 1616 in the title and includes a short poem by John Milton sen., a close friend of Lane, among its dedicatory poems; interestingly, it is mistitled &#145;Spencers Squiers Tale&#146;, an error Lane corrects in his 1630 revised continuation  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 53).<br>
<br>Lane's next work, &#145;Tritons Trumpet to the Twelve Monethes Husbanded and Moralized by John Lane &hellip; 1621&#146;, is a long pastoral modelled after the calendar structure of Spenser's <span class="italic">Shepheardes Calender</span>. It exists in two manuscripts, both in Lane's hand  (BL, Royal MS 17 B.xv and Trinity College, Cambridge, MS O.2.68). Lane begins each month with a husbandry section, modelled on Thomas Tusser, and then follows with a moral tale. In the November section Lane celebrates the elder Milton's musical ability. His &#145;Corrected historie of Sir Gwy, earle of Warwick &hellip; begun by Dan Lidgate &hellip; but now diligentlie exquired from all antiquitie&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 5243) is prefaced with a commendatory sonnet by the elder Milton. Although it bears an imprimatur by John Taverner, dated 13 July 1617, the <span class="italic">Guy of Warwick</span> manuscript is dated 1621 in its title. The prose introduction to this work is printed in <span class="italic">Bishop Percy's Folio Manuscript</span>  (Hales and Furnivall, 2.521&#150;5).<br>
<br>On 25 May 1621 Lane and John Milton sen. bought some property at the north end of Gray's Inn Lane from a Dr Leonard Poe, which they sold on 22 April 1622 to James Kent. On 9 February 1622 Milton lent &pound;50 to Edwarde Raymonde, who listed James Ayloffe as the surety for his debt, which was to be paid with interest in six months' time. A bond for &pound;100 was made out to John Lane&#151;the extra being to cover potential costs if Lane were forced to go to court to collect the debt&#151;and throughout future legal writs on the loan Milton and Lane were usually named together. The whole matter ended in a series of lawsuits, during which time Raymonde died and Milton and Lane were forced to take Ayloffe to court to collect what remained of the debt. Ayloffe, of course, accused Milton and Lane of acting in collusion with Raymonde, and sued the two himself in a 1 May 1624 chancery bill, which Milton answered on 10 May of that year. What finally came of all of this is unknown, but it appears that throughout the course of legal wrangling Lane was a subsidiary figure.<br>
<br>The next record of Lane is the 1630 revision of his earlier continuation of Chaucer's <span class="italic">Squire's Tale</span>: &#145;Chaucers piller, beinge his master-peece, called the squiers tale; wch hath binn given lost, for allmost thease three hundred yeares: but now fownd out, and brought to light by John Lane&#146;. This revised manuscript, dedicated to &#145;the virtuous Queene Marie&#146;, omits most of the commendatory poems from the 1616 manuscript but adds a short poem, titled &#145;The Muse to the Fowre Windes&#146;, wherein Lane lists his works. He mentions &#145;more <i>Poetick Visions</i>&#146;, alluding to a two-part work which Edward Phillips lists in his 1675 <span class="italic">Theatrum poetarum</span> but of which nothing is known, and his <span class="italic">Alarum to Poets</span>, which was finally printed in quarto in 1648. The <span class="italic">Alarum to Poets</span> is Lane's final publication and is dedicated &#145;to the most ingenious classis laureat wheresoever&#146;. Although the <span class="italic">Alarum</span> was probably printed posthumously Lane must have lived for some time beyond 1630, the year in which Edward Phillips was born, since Phillips claims that Lane &#145;was living within my remembrance&#146;  (Phillips, 111).<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Theatrum poetarum</span> Phillips writes a glowing tribute to Lane, describing him as &#145;a fine old Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> Gentleman&#146; and asserting that, had his longer works been published, they &#145;might possibly have gain'd him a name not much inferiour, if not equal to <i>Drayton</i>, and others of the next rank to <i>Spencer</i>&#146;  (Phillips, 111&#150;12). Lane in fact self-consciously modelled his career on Spenser's; when listing his works at the end of the <span class="italic">Alarum</span> (and elsewhere) he arranges them to suggest a move from pastoral to epic. His career, however, never blossomed, and he has had little if any influence on subsequent generations.<br>
