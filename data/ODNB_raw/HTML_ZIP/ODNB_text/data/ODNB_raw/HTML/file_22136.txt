<span class="headword">Phillimore,  John George</span>  (1808&#150;1865), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22137/', "Joseph Phillimore (1775&#150;1855)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1859), daughter of the Revd Walter Bagot, was born at 62 Gower Street, London, on 5 January 1808. He was educated at Westminster School between 1817 and 1824, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was faculty student from 1824 until his marriage in 1839. He graduated BA in 1828, having taken a second class in the classical schools, and MA in 1831.<br>
<br>From 1827 to 1832 Phillimore held a clerkship in the Board of Control for India. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 5 February 1828, and was called to the bar on 24 November 1832. He practised on the Oxford circuit for a number of years, and was appointed a revising barrister in 1837. On 1 August 1839 he married Rosalind Margaret, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3738/', "James Lewis Knight Bruce")</script>, the future lord justice. In July 1851 he attained the rank of queen's counsel, and on 3 November of the same year he was elected a bencher of his inn. In January 1851 he was appointed reader in civil law and jurisprudence at the Middle Temple, and in June the following year he became reader in constitutional law and history to the inns of court.<br>
<br>In his legal writings Phillimore was a consistent and determined opponent of the archaic forms of the common law, and had a particular detestation of special pleading. For him the great intellectual blemish of the English was their incapacity to abandon empirical detail in favour of generalizing principle, a blemish he claimed was found most abundantly (but not exclusively) among the practitioners of common law. He looked to Roman law and to continental systems as reservoirs of principle and rationality. He was a strong advocate of law reform, and supported the ideas of codification, the fusion of law and equity, the creation of a separate court of appeal, and a system of public prosecution. He set out his views in a number of pamphlets on law reform, including his <span class="italic">Letter to the Lord Chancellor on the Reform of the Law</span> (1847) and <span class="italic">Thoughts on Law Reform</span> (1847).<br>
<br>As a result of his lecturing, Phillimore published a number of works on Roman law and jurisprudence, as well as on canon law, including <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Study and History of the Roman Law</span> (1848), <span class="italic">Private Law among the Romans</span> (1863), and <span class="italic">Principles and Maxims of Jurisprudence</span> (1856). He also published the first volume of <span class="italic">A History of England during the Reign of George the Third</span> (1863). While these works displayed an extensive and varied range of reading, they were also vehicles for strong invective against contemporary English law and lawyers; hence Phillimore's writings were not popular among the profession. He was a regular contributor on constitutional and jurisprudential questions to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> and to the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>, for whom he wrote the article &#145;English jurisprudence&#146; in 1857.<br>
<br>A whig and an admirer of Lord John Russell, Phillimore's greatest ambition was to obtain a seat in parliament. In 1852 he was elected as MP for Leominster as a Liberal. In parliament he supported law reform (being on the select committee on the bill for the appointment of public prosecutors), the extension of the franchise, vote by ballot, and the abolition of church rates. However, just as he antagonized the profession, so he antagonized his party, and in 1857 the Liberal chief whip, Sir William Hayter, told Phillimore's election agents that the government preferred to have a tory to so &#145;inconvenient&#146; a member as Phillimore. Conservative candidates were thus returned unopposed for Leominster in 1857. Phillimore died at his home, Shiplake House, Shiplake, near Henley, Oxfordshire, on 27 April 1865, and was survived by his wife. Their only son, Egerton Grenville Bagot Phillimore, was born in 1857.<br>
