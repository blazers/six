<span class="headword">Richardson, Sir  Michael John de Rougemont</span>  (1925&#150;2003), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 9 April 1925 at 13 Pitt Street, Kensington, London, the eldest of three sons of Arthur Wray Richardson, a City insurance broker, and his wife, Audrey, <i>n&eacute;e</i> de Rougemont. Educated at Harrow School before being evacuated to Kent School, Connecticut, during the Second World War, he joined the Irish Guards in 1943. Seriously wounded at Nijmegen, he served in Palestine before leaving the army as a captain in 1949. After a few weeks at Cambridge he left to join the Drayton Group, run by the controversial financier Harley Drayton, where he worked in the investment trust business. On 16 July 1949 he married Octavia Joyce (Paddy) Mayhew (<i>d</i>. 1999), a 23-year-old games mistress and daughter of Arthur Joyce Mayhew, mining engineer. They had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Richardson joined Panmure Gordon &amp; Co. as a junior partner in 1952, and remained there for almost twenty years, until 1971, when he joined Cazenove &amp; Co. Disappointed not to get the top job there in 1981, he accepted an invitation to join N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd as managing director. From 1990 to 1994 he was vice-chairman of Rothschilds and chairman of Smith New Court plc, the securities trading house in which Rothschilds had a stake. In 1995 he became vice-chairman of JO Hambro Magan, remaining with its successor, Hawkpoint Partners, from 1996 to 1999. Although he was the ultimate insider, his career was defined by dealmaking for those outside the charmed circle, identifying a new breed of entrepreneurs challenging the financial establishment&#151;James Hanson, Gordon White, and John King, all ultimately ennobled, but notoriously also Asil Nadir, who fled beyond the reach of extradition after the collapse of his Polly Peck business, and Robert Maxwell, who plundered Mirror Group Newspapers.<br>
<br>Richardson began to make his reputation in the 1950s with a series of successful transactions. He was involved on the winning side of one of the earliest contested takeovers, of British Aluminium, in 1958, a bid publicly resisted &#145;in the national interest&#146; by many blue-chip institutions. He became a key financier for many high-profile takeover battles as the City turned more aggressive. He was a close adviser of James Hanson as the latter built up an empire acquiring underperforming companies. When, later, he rescued Hanson's floundering 1985 rights issue, Hanson took down a prized racehorse painting from behind his desk and sent it round to Richardson. Later still, he would covertly buy shares for Hanson for the unsuccessful assault on ICI, then the UK's largest manufacturing company.<br>
<br>Richardson's association with Robert Maxwell began in 1964 when he acted on Maxwell's behalf in the flotation of Pergamon Press. Later he bought shares in Pergamon to inflate the price when Maxwell tried to buy the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>, and stayed close even when a government report found Maxwell not to be relied on &#145;to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly-quoted company&#146;  (T. Bower, <span class="italic">Maxwell the Outsider</span>, 1988, 222). He made a glowing speech at Maxwell's sixty-fifth birthday party, was involved in the controversial flotation of the Mirror Group in 1991 when its finances were already seriously compromised, and was the man Maxwell's sons phoned for advice when their father went missing at sea later that year. After Maxwell's misdeeds began to come to light Richardson famously remarked &#145;Bob was squeaky clean to me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 16 May 2003).<br>
<br>Richardson was an early supporter and became a personal friend of Margaret Thatcher, another outsider, encountered when their sons played cricket together at Harrow. Eyebrows were raised when he became the only City adviser to the small Treasury group which laid plans for privatization under her government, and then earned millions in fees for Rothschilds as the major beneficiary of the programme he had helped construct. Dubbed a &#145;privateer of privatisation&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 20 May 2003), he even devised an audacious plan to sell Powergen&#151;half the nationalized electricity industry&#151;to his old friend Hanson. The plan failed after a leak, but the price rose. Richardson however met his match in Nigel Lawson, over the sale of the government's residual stake in BP in 1987. When the stockmarket crashed between pricing and closing, Richardson backed the underwriters' calls for the flotation to be pulled. Lawson refused, settling instead for a buy-back offer at a lower price (at a cost of many millions to the underwriting banks).<br>
<br>Richardson was knighted under the Conservative government in 1990; his brand of suave ruthlessness was ideally suited to the times. Known for his charm and remembering the names even of minor players, he used his regular table at the River Room at the Savoy to spread his web. In his pomp he was ubiquitous. When one grateful client murmured appreciation of a typically sage but brief appearance, an assistant was heard to wonder aloud, &#145;But does he have any idea which bid this is?&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>Richardson's career paralleled the post-war progression of the City of London from gentlemen's club to eager partner in the controversial practices of transatlantic dealmaking. He became the most consummate City fixer of the 1980s and 1990s, and the Conservative government's principal adviser on privatization. He was memorably described by Nigel Lawson as &#145;at first sight too suave and smooth to be true &hellip; his unfailing charm, courtesy and good manners disarmed all who came into contact with him &hellip; he owed his success to manipulating people rather than money&#146;  (Lawson, 758). Others saw a more sinister side, and insouciance about his clients finally betrayed him when in 2001 he was banned from doing business in the City &#145;in any capacity&#146; after writing letters confirming credit for a client twice declared bankrupt. Bemused by the new climate of regulation, he called it &#145;a very harsh view of a small error&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>).<br>
<br>Richardson was a keen small boat sailor and huntsman (serving as joint master of the Crawley and Horsham hunt; he lived at Butterstocks, Shipley, near Horsham). He was also a prominent freemason but claimed that he &#145;never combined Masonry with business in any way&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 5 Feb 1995). His last years were spent under the shadow both of his ban from the City and of oesophageal cancer. He died at the London Clinic, 20 Devonshire Place, Westminster, on 12 May 2003, of pneumonia, and was survived by his three children, his wife, Paddy, having predeceased him.<br>
