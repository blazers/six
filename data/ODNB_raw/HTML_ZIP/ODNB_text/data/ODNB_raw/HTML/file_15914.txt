<span class="headword">Lamb,  Frederick James</span>, Baron Beauvale and third Viscount Melbourne  (1782&#150;1853), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 17 April 1782, the third son and third of six surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47307/', "Elizabeth Lamb, n&#233;e Milbanke, Viscountess Melbourne (d. 1818)")</script>. It seems probable that his father was not her husband, Peniston Lamb, first Viscount Melbourne (1745&#150;1828), but <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30141/', "George O'Brien Wyndham, third earl of Egremont (1751&#150;1837)")</script>. His elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15920/', "William Lamb, second Viscount Melbourne")</script>, was to be prime minister, and his sister Emily [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40959/', "Temple, Emily Mary, Viscountess Palmerston")</script>] was to be the wife of another. They were to be separated for much of their lives, but Fred remained close to William and Emily, and they carried on a voluminous correspondence.<br>
<br>Fred Lamb was educated with William at Eton College, at Glasgow University under Professor John Millar, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took his MA in 1803. He initially joined the army, as a cornet in the Horse Guards (1803), but in 1811 joined the diplomatic service as secretary of legation to Naples, moving in the same capacity in 1813 to Vienna. The prince regent (who was probably the father of at least one of the other Lamb children) took an interest in launching his career. In 1815 he went as minister-plenipotentiary to Munich, remaining there for five years. He was sworn of the privy council in 1822, in which year he went to Frankfurt as minister. From 1825 to 1827 he was minister in Madrid, and in the latter year was appointed GCB.<br>
<br>In December 1827 Sir Frederick was sent to Lisbon as ambassador to Portugal, where Dom Miguel, the uncle of the queen, was attempting to usurp the throne. A British force previously sent to support the constitutionalist queen was due to leave Portugal, but Lamb detained them on his own responsibility, in an unsuccessful attempt to frustrate Dom Miguel's plan. Although the Wellington ministry endorsed his actions, the troops were nevertheless recalled; in England the following August, Lamb made no secret of the fact that he thought the government had acted &#145;very ill and foolishly in first encouraging and then abandoning the wretched constitutionalists to their fate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Greville Memoirs</span>, 1.141). On 13 May 1831 Lamb was appointed ambassador at the court of Vienna, and remained there until the whigs fell from office in 1841. A &#145;hard-headed reactionary&#146;  (Bourne, 461), Lamb bombarded his brother (as home secretary and then prime minister) with warnings against the radicals in the whig government, and his conservatism in foreign policy brought him into conflict with the foreign secretary, Palmerston. Lamb was, however, more at home in Metternich's Vienna than he would have been in Paris (to which his seniority and skill probably entitled him); there his differences with Palmerston could scarcely have been contained. Lamb was created Baron Beauvale in 1839, and succeeded his brother as third Viscount Melbourne in 1848.<br>
<br>Fred Lamb was a thorough whig (despite his political conservatism), by upbringing and position. A product of the eccentric social, political, and moral <i>milieu</i> of the Melbourne and Devonshire House set, he tended to see &#145;life in the most degrading light, and he simplifies the thing by thinking all men rogues and all women [whores]&#146;  (Lady Granville, cited in Mitchell, 10). He had a constant succession of mistresses, both amateur and professional (including Harriette Wilson, who gave him a friendly write-up in her notorious <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>), until his very late marriage on 25 February 1841. His wife, the Countess Alexandrina Julia Theresa Wilhelmina Sophia (Adine) von Maltzahn (1818&#150;1894), daughter of the Prussian minister at Vienna, was some thirty-five years his junior, but the marriage was successful (if childless), and Lady Beauvale was devoted to her ageing, increasingly valetudinarian husband. Frederick's relationship with his brother Melbourne resumed the closeness of their youth in the 1840s, and the Beauvales took the burden of responsibility for Melbourne in his final years. Frederick retained his liking for political gossip, and his letters continued unabated: his sister remained his most important correspondent, but he also remained in touch with the Russian Princess Lieven. He died, the third and last Viscount Melbourne, at his home, Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, on 29 January 1853, having suffered terribly with gout for some time. His young widow was genuinely prostrated with grief, but eventually recovered and in 1856 married John George, second Baron Forester. The Lamb estates passed to his sister, Emily Palmerston.<br>
