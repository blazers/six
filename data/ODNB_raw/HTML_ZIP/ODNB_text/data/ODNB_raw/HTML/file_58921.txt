<span class="headword">Mortimer,  Francis James</span>  (1874&#150;1944), <span class="occ">photographer, writer, and editor</span>, was born at 9 Ordnance Row, Portsea, Portsmouth, on 27 November 1874, the only son and second of the two children of Francis Charles Mortimer (1849&#150;1909), a dental surgeon of Scilly Isles descent, and his wife, Clara Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyer (1853&#150;1909). A frail tubercular child, Mortimer only began his formal education aged ten at Portsmouth grammar school and later took evening classes at the local art school. One of his many prizes in children's art exhibitions was a box camera and in 1888 he became a junior member of the Portsmouth Photographic Society (of which his father was one of the founders). Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a fellow member. Mortimer later became the society's secretary and president. He also played the banjo and, later, the pianola, regarding it as the &#145;camera of music&#146;. There were strong theatrical, journalistic, and collecting urges on both sides of the family. His father wrote for theatrical publications and collected books, medals, china, and coins. His mother's father, a surgical instrument maker by trade, wrote pantomimes for Portsmouth Theatre Royal and started the first amateur dramatic society in Portsmouth.<br>
<br>In 1891 Mortimer became an articled clerk to the solicitor Albert Besant, the brother of the novelist and historian Sir Walter Besant, and passed his Law Society exams in 1895. He preferred his journalism, design, and photography to his day job, so when his firm went bankrupt, he decided that photography, rather than the legal profession, would be his future. From 1895 to 1899, working as a freelancer, he had cartoons published in <span class="italic">The Idler</span> and <span class="italic">Photographic News</span> and photographs in a variety of publications. In 1899 and 1900 he won silver and bronze medals in the All England Crystal Palace poster competition and exhibition and in 1901, <span class="italic">The Poster</span> magazine awarded him first prize for a three-colour poster design. He began to design professionally, joined the Poster Academy, and contributed to the magazine. He also amassed a large collection of Japanese woodblock prints by Hokusai and Hiroshige, used as wrapping paper for Japanese imports, which he exhibited at the Camera Club in London in 1913. His large collection of posters was also exhibited at the Camera Club in London in 1915.<br>
<br>In 1901 Mortimer spent time with relatives on the Scilly Islands, rediscovering his Scillonian roots and experimenting with photographing the sea. With a lifeline tied around him, he would go &#145;big wave-hunting&#146; often losing his camera apparatus in the crashing waves. Marine photography always fascinated him and he became its best-known exponent. One of his most famous marine photographs was the <span class="italic">Wreck of the Arden Craig</span>, taken off the Scilly Isles in January 1911.<br>
<br>In 1902 Mortimer moved to London to pursue his journalistic and photographic careers, having been invited by Alfred Horsley Hinton, editor of <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span>, to write illustrated articles for the publication and also to submit photographs for <span class="italic">Photograms of the Year</span>. In 1904 he became assistant editor at the <span class="italic">British Journal of Photography</span>, moving to edit <span class="italic">Photographic News</span>, 1906&#150;8. On 19 December 1905, at Clapham parish church, he married Lavinia or Queenie (1878&#150;1930), the youngest child of a Polish engineer, Benjamin Romer, of Portsea. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>On Hinton's death in February 1908 Mortimer became editor of the merged <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span> and <span class="italic">Photographic News</span>, a position he retained until his death. His opening issue (12 May 1908) featured the magazine's first pictorial cover. He also took over editorship of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Photography</span> and wrote, revised, and edited books including <span class="italic">Magnesium Light Photography</span> (1906), <span class="italic">Oil and Bromoil Process</span> (1909), <span class="italic">Photography for the Press and Photography for Profit</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">Kodak Bromide Pictures by Someone who Makes Them</span> (1917). From 1912 to 1944 he was editor of <span class="italic">Photograms of the Year</span> in succession to Henry Snowden Ward. He contributed the entry &#145;Photographic Art&#146; for the fourteenth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1929).<br>
<br>Mortimer had joined the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) in 1904, was made a fellow in 1905, a council member in 1908, and an honorary fellow in 1918 before finally becoming president (1940&#150;42) while also president of the rival organization, the Camera Club (1938&#150;44). He was awarded the society's silver progress medal, its highest honour, in March 1944 a few months before his death. He had more one-man exhibitions at the RPS than any other photographer.<br>
<br>On 20 May 1908 Mortimer became a member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood, a secession group of photographers who had resigned from the RPS in 1892 and formed their own organization, henceforth exhibiting annually at their own very successful photographic salon. Mortimer's pseudonym within the Linked Ring was Bromoiler, given his expertise in the bromoil process. The photographic salon of 1908, featuring a preponderance of supposedly avant-garde work by American members of the Linked Ring, caused widespread dissatisfaction among the more pictorially inclined British Links whose work had been rejected. Mortimer quickly organized a salon des refus&eacute;s, held at the Little Gallery in the offices of the <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span> at 52 Long Acre in Covent Garden, showing the 128 rejected exhibits by the fifty-three more conventional British photographers.<br>
<br>This set off a chain of events which caused, with much antagonism and vituperation, the break up of the Linked Ring in 1910 after all the American members, led by Alfred Stieglitz, resigned and the remaining British members, led by Mortimer, reformed as the London Salon and exhibited from 1910, with Mortimer as honorary secretary. A vitriolic and abusive correspondence, printed in the British photographic press, ensued between Stieglitz, the undisputed leader of American photography, and Mortimer, who was rapidly becoming the unchallenged British leader. After this date American and British photography veered widely apart as Stieglitz took his inspiration from contemporary fine art, straight photography, and modernism while British photography settled back into the embrace of a more conventional and patriotic pictorialism.<br>
<br>Too old for active service, Mortimer worked during the First World War as a photographic intelligence officer and special constable. He sold 1000 copies of his naval photograph <span class="italic">The Empire's Watchdogs</span> for 1 shilling each, the proceeds going to the prince of Wales's National Relief Fund, and wrote famously stirring and patriotic editorials in <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span>. He photographed a much reproduced series on women's war work and his famous 1917 photograph, <span class="italic">The Gate of Goodbye</span>, a combination print from several negatives made at Victoria Station, became a classic image of the First World War and was eventually hung in the newly founded Imperial War Museum.<br>
<br>Mortimer worked tirelessly as an editor, writer, photographer, exhibitor, and judge, establishing photography's credentials not only in Britain but also around the world. He was awarded over 400 medals for his own photography and sat on a wide variety of committees. From 1926 to his death he made many radio broadcasts on photography, reproduced in <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, and ventured into television from 1939 to 1943. Always photographing, he also worked under the pseudonyms of Francis Jay and Margaret Le Gallienne, producing rather fey images of nude nymphs. Following the death of his first wife, he married, on 24 June 1931, Lucy Embling 
    (Gloria; <i>b</i>. 1896)
  , widow of Charles E. Dawson and only daughter of James Embling Dart (1872&#150;1938), a retired civil servant.<br>
<br>In 1942 Mortimer was made a CBE for his contribution to the role of photography during the Second World War. He was struck in the explosion of a flying bomb while travelling to his office at 9.30 a.m. on 23 June 1944. He continued to the office, finished editing that week's issue of <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span> and then collapsed. Despite apparently making a promising recovery he died a month later on 27 July 1944 at the London Clinic nursing home, 20 Devonshire Place, London. An obituary summarized him, slightly gracelessly, as &#145;The most potent force in British photography since the death of Alfred Horsley Hinton in 1908&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 July 1944).<br>
