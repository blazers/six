<span class="headword">Magennis <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>McGinnes]</span>,  James Joseph</span>  (1919&#150;1986), <span class="occ">submariner</span>, was born on 27 October 1919 at 4 Majorca Street, west Belfast, the second son and third of the five children of William McGinnes and his wife, Mary Jane Murphy. His father was a Scottish-born itinerant musician who soon abandoned his wife and children, leaving Mary to survive on a series of temporary sewing jobs. James attended St Finian's School, Falls Road, Belfast, until 1935, when he enlisted in the Royal Navy, at which point he adopted the surname Magennis. From 1936, as a first-class boy seaman and later ordinary seaman, he served on several warships before being posted to the destroyer HMS <i>Kandahar</i> in October 1939. In May 1940 he saw action in the North Sea when the sister-ship HMS <i>Kelly</i>, commanded by Lord Louis Mountbatten, was disabled by German torpedoes. He later served in the Mediterranean, and in December 1941, when <i>Kandahar</i> struck a mine and sank off Tripoli, he had to swim to safety.<br>
<br>In December 1942 Magennis was drafted into the Submarine Service, and in March 1943 volunteered for special service in X-class &#145;midget&#146; submarines. He trained as a diver, and in September 1943 took part in the first major use of the X-craft. Two submarines penetrated Kaafjord, north Norway, and disabled the German battleship <i>Tirpitz</i>. For his part Magennis was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>In 1944 Magennis was promoted to leading seaman and began training on a new class of XE submarines designed for use in tropical waters. Early in 1945 his unit was sent out to Australia and trained to cut enemy undersea telegraph cables. In July 1945 they were deployed to attack two Japanese cruisers, <i>Myoko</i> and <i>Takao</i>, moored in the Johore Strait. Magennis's submarine, XE3, was given the <i>Takao</i> as target, and on 31 July Magennis attached limpet mines to the vessel under particularly difficult circumstances. He first had to squeeze through a partly open diving hatch directly below the target and then, handicapped by leaking breathing apparatus, scrape barnacles from the surface of the ship. Having returned exhausted to the submarine he volunteered to go outside again to release a limpet mine carrier that had failed to jettison correctly. For their part in the operation Magennis and the commander of the submarine, Lieutenant Ian Fraser, were each awarded the Victoria Cross.<br>
<br>Magennis's award led to a period of great celebrity just after the war, but the ultimately shabby way in which he, Northern Ireland's only holder of the VC in the Second World War, was treated by his home city formed a painful coda to his story. Although he was given a civic reception in December 1945 and the &pound;3000 proceeds of a public subscription, the Belfast city fathers, perhaps believing that such an honour could not be bestowed on a working-class Catholic from the inner-city slums, refused to grant him the freedom of the city. In 1946 Magennis married Edna Skidmore, with whom he had four sons. He left the navy in 1949 and returned to Belfast, where he found it hard to make a living and at some point sold his Victoria Cross. In 1955 he moved to Yorkshire, where he worked as an electrician. His final years were marred by chronic ill health, and on 11 February 1986 he died of lung cancer in the Royal Halifax Infirmary.<br>
<br>Magennis was commemorated by a memorial in his adopted home of Bradford. In October 1999, following a lengthy local campaign, a 6 foot-high Portland stone and bronze memorial to him was unveiled in the grounds of Belfast city hall.<br>
