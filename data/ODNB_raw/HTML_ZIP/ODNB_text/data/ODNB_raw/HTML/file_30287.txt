<span class="headword">Younge,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1636&#150;1673), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, was a member of the Young family who held land in Roxwell in Essex; otherwise nothing more is known of his family background and parentage. He moved to London and settled first in Moorgate, then moved out east to Stratford in Essex and finally south of the river to Newington Causeway. In one work he described himself as &#145;gentleman&#146;  (Younge, <span class="italic">Englands Unthankfulness</span>, 1653, title page) but in 1646 George Thomason thought he was a grocer (it is not clear whether by this he meant Younge's occupation or his livery company).<br>
<br>Younge devoted much of his time to writing short moralistic and evangelical tracts and publishing them, often at his own expense. He was moderately well versed in the classics, and had read in the fathers as well as many current works, and was able to imitate a variety of literary genres, such as dialogues, &#145;characters&#146;, open letters, allegories, commonplaces, and devotional verse, as well as write short treatises and compose prayers. He sometimes called himself R. Junius, probably a play on his surname, or Florilegus, referring to his technique of picking the best flowers from &#145;the choicest authors ancient and modern&#146; and arranging them in attractive &#145;nosegays&#146; to catch readers' attention (<span class="italic">A Soveraigne Antidote Against All Griefe</span>, 1647, title page; <span class="italic">A Christian Library</span>, 1655, sig. 2<i>r</i>). He was regarded as sufficiently orthodox to receive the imprimatur of both the episcopalian authorities in the late 1630s and the 1660s, and the parliamentarian and Commonwealth authorities in the 1640s and 1650s. Some of his works also bear flattering epistles from a variety of leading clergy of the day, such as Daniel Featley, Thomas Goodwin, Edmund Calamy, and Richard Baxter. By the Restoration, Younge was hostile to the sects but loyal to Charles II, and it was for &#145;the common good&#146; of all unregenerate people that he posed as the &#145;impartial monitor&#146; warning of the penalties of sin and the need to repent at once (<span class="italic">The Cure of Misprision</span>, 1646, title page; <span class="italic">The Peoples Impartiall and Compassionate Monitor</span>, 1659, title page).<br>
<br>Younge wrote and published over fifty works between 1636 and 1673: the exact number is hard to pin down since he reworked the content or changed the titles of many of his earlier works. He admitted frankly that he published as fast as the material came from his pen, with little planning. If a work was too long he persuaded the printer to cram text onto the final page in smaller typeface, or promised to complete his argument in a later work; if it was too short he provided a filler from his own or others' work. The contents of his composite works were also rarely as promised in the contents, and vary from copy to copy.<br>
<br>To maximize the impact of his works, especially among those with limited literacy and funds, Younge opted for simple messages and colourful language, long print runs, and constantly referred to where his other publications could be obtained. His habit of selling works at below cost price, or lending copies (on deposit of 2<i>d</i>.), or even giving them away, did not endear him to regular booksellers, and to circulate his works he had to use his own house, or inns, or the premises of friendly members of the trade, such as James Crump, a bookbinder in Well Yard, St Bartholomew by the Exchange. Several works were sufficiently popular to be reprinted more than once, and of his <span class="italic">Serious and Pathetical Description of Heaven and Hell</span> (1658) Younge claimed that a hundred copies a day were being &#145;fetcht&#146;  (p. 37). Copies were also sent to America, and his <span class="italic">Short and Sure Way to Grace and Salvation</span> was translated into German in 1704.<br>
<br>About a quarter of Younge's works were indictments of drinking, swearing, keeping evil company, covetousness, and ambition, and the evil consequences these had for England. <span class="italic">Englands Unthankfulness Striving with Gods Goodness</span> was said to have reached its fourth edition by 1643; <span class="italic">A Hopefull Way to Cure that Horrid Sinne of Swearing</span> was his best-selling title between about 1643 and 1659; <span class="italic">The Blemish of Government</span>, written on behalf of &#145;the sober party in three nations&#146; contained an appeal to stamp out drunkenness directed in 1655 to the protector and in 1664 to Charles II (<span class="italic">The Blemish of Government</span>, 1656, title page; <span class="italic">A Sovereign Antidote</span>, 1664, 7). He returned to similar material in <span class="italic">An Account of the Four Late Judgements</span> on England in the years 1665&#150;7. Other works stressed the importance of hearing good sermons, the need for knowledge of God's word, and for the rich to help the poor, but a higher proportion was devoted to spiritual matters, often reflecting high Calvinist emphases. Early works on the benefits of affliction such as <span class="italic">The Victory of Patience</span> (1636) and <span class="italic">A Counterpoyson, or, Soverain Antidote Against All Griefe</span> (1641) gave way to later emphases on the need for introspective &#145;trying&#146; of the heart and conversion, as in three works first published in 1658: <span class="italic">A Short and Sure Way to Grace and Salvation</span>, <span class="italic">An Experimental Index of the Heart</span>, and <span class="italic">Preparation to Conversion</span>.<br>
<br>In the 1660s, when the cost of paper and printing rose, Younge was forced to admit that his works could &#145;no longer be given or sold to loss&#146;, and he was becoming tired and disillusioned. If men did not think his books &#145;worth penny a sheet, I shall not think them worth my labour&#146;, and so &#145;farewell printing, welcome rest, and a retired life&#146;  (R. Younge, <span class="italic">An Account of the Four Late Judgements</span>, 1667, sig. D2<i>r</i>). But the response must have encouraged him to carry on, and by 1671 copies were again being given away &#145;to many that desire but will not buy&#146;  (R. Younge, <span class="italic">A Sparke of Divine Light</span>, 1671, 24). The limited number of repeat editions after 1673, and reference in a 1674 reprint to the &#145;late&#146; author, suggest that by then death had finally removed Younge's drive to publish.<br>
<br>It is striking that new editions of three of Younge's later works were taken up and &#145;printed at the charge of Christs-Hospital&#146; on at least six occasions between 1674 and 1776, presumably for distribution among its residents. Younge had successfully anticipated the tactics of the charitable societies and evangelical organizations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but a full study of his life and works is awaited.<br>
