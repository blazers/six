<span class="headword">Fielding,  Una Lucy</span>  (1888&#150;1969), <span class="occ">neuroanatomist</span>, was born on 2 May 1888 in Wellington, New South Wales, Australia. She was the eldest of five surviving children of the Revd Sydney Glanville Fielding, Anglican clergyman and author, and Lucy Frances Johnson. In 1893 the family moved to Windsor, near Sydney, where Una attended a small private school, transferring to St Catherine's Clergy Daughters' School in Waverley, New South Wales, in 1900. In 1907 Fielding won a scholarship to the University of Sydney, where she graduated BA in English and French in 1910. For six years she taught as a governess and in secondary schools in New South Wales, until, fulfilling a lifelong ambition to study medicine, she returned to the University of Sydney, earning the degree of BSc in 1919 and graduating MB ChM in 1922, one of only ten women in a class of over one hundred students.<br>
<br>After a short time as a demonstrator at the University of Sydney in 1923, Fielding left Australia for University College, London, where her compatriot, Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, was head of the department of anatomy. At first Fielding earned so little as a demonstrator that she had to trim hats in the evening in order to support herself. Elliot Smith encouraged her to study the <i>monotremes</i>, the lowest form of mammals. In 1925, she presented her first paper on the brain of <i>notoryctes</i>, the marsupial mole, to the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, which she had joined in 1923.<br>
<br>In 1927 Fielding spent a term as a demonstrator in neurology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and in 1928&#150;9 was seconded as acting professor of histology and nervous anatomy to the American University of Beirut, where she helped to set up the department of anatomy. During this period Fielding collaborated with A. Parkes and F. W. R. Brambell in several publications on the ovary. She produced her most important work, however, upon her return from Beirut, when, based on her observations of <i>notoryctes</i>, she and Gregor T. Popa, professor of anatomy at the University of Jassy (Romania) and Rockefeller research fellow at University College, discovered the vascular link between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland; their joint findings were published in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal of Anatomy</span> between 1930 and 1932.<br>
<br>In 1928 Fielding was appointed lecturer in anatomy at University College, where she taught physiology undergraduates, pre-clinical medical students, and helped supervise postgraduates. Possessing a lifelong interest in anthropology Fielding also taught elementary physical anthropology to students in University College's department of archaeology and Egyptology. Meanwhile she continued her own research on the brain of the marsupial mole, publishing several papers independently in the 1930s. In 1935 Fielding was promoted to reader in neurological anatomy (known from 1937 as neuroanatomy) at University College. During this period Fielding started work on a textbook of neuroanatomy, of which her encyclopaedic knowledge and clear presentation made her an ideal author. She was interrupted, however, by the sudden death in January 1939 of H. H. Woollard, Elliot Smith's successor, and by the outbreak of war, during which all the notes for her book were destroyed by enemy action. From 1939 she served as acting head of the department of anatomy, initially overseeing the evacuation of the women medical students to Sheffield, and later the removal of the whole medical school to a manor house near Leatherhead, Surrey. Colleagues recall her tenure as a unique period in which men and women students and staff members found themselves living and working together under the same roof in one of the first truly co-educational medical school environments in England. Indeed, some colleagues felt that Fielding, who was particularly supportive of the women students, was never fully recognized for her role in holding the medical school together during the war years.<br>
<br>Fielding remained as acting head of the department until the appointment of Professor J. Z. Young in 1945. In 1947, feeling that she needed a change, she resigned from University College to take a position organizing the anatomy department at the new Farouk 1st University in Alexandria, Egypt. Although she enjoyed the challenges of her work in Egypt, Fielding had to resign her position in December 1951 because of a radical shift in government policy which prohibited foreigners from holding office. She left Egypt in February 1952, forced to leave behind her valuable collection of books, papers, and drawings.<br>
<br>After returning to England Una Fielding taught as a visiting lecturer at St Mary's, St Thomas's, and Middlesex Hospital medical schools, and tried once again to write her textbook. In 1965 she was appointed to the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England to reorganize and summarize the catalogue of brain specimens originally prepared by her mentor, Elliot Smith, in 1902. She produced a small book illustrated by line drawings which summarized the main points of each entry for students.<br>
<br>Never in good health, Una Fielding became seriously ill in late 1968, and died on 11 August 1969 at St Pancras Hospital, London. In addition to her command of anatomy, Fielding was knowledgeable about literature, the arts, and architecture. She was active for many years in the British Federation of University Women, in fact living in its headquarters and residence, Crosby Hall, in Chelsea. Her colleagues described her as small in stature, with dark hair and eyes, usually wearing dark clothing and a hat. Although modest and self-effacing, she had a strong sense of justice and a reputed complete disregard for appearances in pursuing her beliefs.<br>
