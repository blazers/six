<span class="headword">Mapletoft,  John</span>  (1631&#150;1721), <span class="occ">physician and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 15 June 1631 at Margaretting, Essex, the second of the three children of Joshua Mapletoft (1594&#150;1635), vicar of Margaretting and rector of Wickford, and his wife, Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of John Collett of North Thoresby, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, Susanna. After his father's death his mother married James Chedley and Mapletoft was brought up with his brother and sister at Little Gidding in the well-known, if small, religious community established there by his great-uncle and godfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9356/', "Nicholas Ferrar")</script>. In 1645 he was sent to Westminster School by his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18019/', "Robert Mapletoft")</script>, later master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and dean of Ely. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 20 May 1648, and graduated BA in January 1652 and MA in 1655. In May 1652 he was admitted a student of Gray's Inn, but he does not appear to have remained there long, as in October 1653 he was elected a fellow of Trinity College, where he later supported Isaac Barrow's scheme for building a library.<br>
<br>On leaving Cambridge in 1658 Mapletoft became tutor to Joceline, son of the earl of Northumberland. Two years later he travelled abroad to France and Rome, where he lived in the household of Algernon Sidney, in order to study physic. By early 1664 he had rejoined the earl's family at Petworth. He took his MD in 1667 at Cambridge, and incorporated the degree at Oxford in 1669.<br>
<br>Mapletoft established a successful practice as a physician in London, numbering several aristocratic families among his patients. He attended Lord Essex on his embassy to Denmark in 1670, and the dowager countess of Northumberland in France in 1672 and again in 1676. Against stiff competition, he succeeded Jonathan Goddard as Gresham professor of physic in 1675. Mapletoft lived in the college for the next three years until he resigned in order to marry, on 18 November 1679, Rebecca, daughter of Lucy Knightley of Hackney, a Hamburg merchant, with whom, as he told his friend Robert Nelson, he learned the vanity &#145;of believing myselfe as happy as any man, either single or married&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 45511, fol. 1). Together they had two sons, Robert (1684&#150;1716) and John (1687&#150;1763), and a daughter, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1761). Rebecca Mapletoft died in November 1693, on the fourteenth anniversary of their marriage.<br>
<br>Through his distant relation Thomas Firmin, Mapletoft became part of an extensive circle including noted natural philosophers such as Robert Hooke, physicians such as Thomas Sydenham, and clergy, particularly latitudinarians such as John Tillotson. Mapletoft was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in February 1676 and was a member of its council in 1677, 1679, 1690, and 1692, during which time he took part in discussions and experiments. He had been at school with John Locke, and they remained on close terms for many years, corresponding regularly when either of them was abroad and consulting each other over difficult patients. Together they became involved with Sydenham's medical researches, acting as secretaries and examining cases. Mapletoft translated several of Sydenham's works into Latin for publication, most notably much of <span class="italic">Observationes medicae</span> (1676), which was dedicated to him, and other texts published in 1683. The extent and details of his role are uncertain, although it seems likely that the idiomatic flavour and classical references in <span class="italic">Observationes</span> reflect his rather florid style.<br>
<br>Mapletoft had always had an inclination towards theology, and following his marriage he gave up physic to prepare himself for ordination. Although he had some scruples about subscribing to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, seeking advice from Simon Patrick about the matter (see Patrick's letter of 8 February 1683 in BL, Add. MS 5878, fol. 151), he took deacon's and priest's orders on 3 March 1683. He had already been presented as (non-resident) rector of Braybrooke, Northamptonshire, and in January 1685 became lecturer at Ipswich, and later that year lecturer at St Christopher's, London. In January 1686, with the support of several prominent city figures, he was selected as vicar of the united parishes of St Lawrence Jewry and St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, London, the parish in which he had been married, where he succeeded the prominent latitudinarian and former provost of King's College, Cambridge, Benjamin Whichcote. He remained vicar there until his death, preaching until he was over eighty years old. In 1690 he graduated DD at Cambridge. Mapletoft was an early member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, joining in 1699, and of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. He was also active in Sion College, an institution designed as a guild of the clergy of the City of London and its suburbs, serving as assistant in 1688 and 1689, senior dean in 1694, and president in 1707, and was involved with Greenwich and St Thomas's hospitals. During his time at St Lawrence Jewry he published a number of sermons, minor works on theology, and collections of proverbs and classical extracts, several of which were republished on a number of occasions. His writings were deeply concerned with the everyday faith of his parishioners, and he distributed copies of his <span class="italic">Principles and Duties of the Christian Religion</span> (1710), a &#145;True, Plain and Useful&#146; account of religion, to each household in his parish.<br>
<br>For most of the last decade of his life Mapletoft lived in Oxford and Westminster with his daughter, who had married Francis Gastrell, canon of Christ Church, Oxford, and bishop of Chester. Mapletoft died in Westminster on 10 November 1721 and was buried under the communion table of St Lawrence Jewry in the same tomb as Benjamin Calamy on 15 November.<br>
