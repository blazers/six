<span class="headword">Stackhouse,  Emily</span>  (1811&#150;1870), <span class="occ">botanical artist</span>, was born at Modbury vicarage, Devon, on 15 July 1811, the fifth of six children (five girls, one boy) of William Stackhouse (1772&#150;1861), vicar of Modbury, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith (1774&#150;1845). The Stackhouse daughters were educated at home (the only son died of cholera at Eton in 1824) within a well-travelled, artistic, and scholarly family circle. Their family was linked by marriage to the Rashleigh family of Menabilly, and were part of a group of distinguished friends and relatives, many of whom were naturalists and parsons. William Stackhouse's uncle was the botanist and classical scholar John Stackhouse. The naturalists John Hawkins and his wife, Mary Sibthorpe Hawkins, of Trewithen, Probus, were neighbours and close friends.<br>
<br>In 1834 the family moved from Modbury to Trehane, Probus, in Cornwall, a 4000 acre estate with a Queen Anne mansion, which William Stackhouse had inherited in 1830. Emily Stackhouse was twenty-three at the time of the move. Her eldest sister, Sarah, had married the Revd William James Pinwill. In future years the Pinwill children also lived at Trehane, alongside their three spinster aunts, Charlotte, Louisa, and Emily. Emily's primary focus was Trehane and its administration, with virtually all the entries in farm ledgers from 1834 to 1861 appearing in her hand.<br>
<br>Emily Stackhouse developed her botanical and artistic interests in the countryside near her home. From about 1830 she produced over 600 watercolours of plants, painted from nature and based on meticulous pencilled sketches. On the reverse of each she inscribed a Linnaean taxonomy in her careful script. Several of her earliest known works as a watercolourist (1834&#150;6) were completed in and around Norwich, where she was staying with Dawson Turner and his family. She painted from nature and travelled widely throughout Britain and Ireland to gather material for her botanical collections and to make drawings. Four albums of her &#145;beautiful botanical drawings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Royal Cornwall Gazette</span>) were displayed at the fourteenth annual Royal Cornwall Polytechnic exhibition at Falmouth in 1846, where they received a bronze medal in the natural history section. The judges stated doubts about their placement, thinking they belonged for judgment in the amateur artist category. In her mind, however, her work in its true light was identification and classification with scientific description and her 1853 exhibition at the polytechnic was entered similarly, with the same results and glowing reviews.<br>
<br>Within Cornish botanical circles Stackhouse made significant friendships with the algologist Elizabeth Andrew Warren (1786&#150;1864), the phycologist Isabella Gifford (<i>c</i>.1823&#150;1891), and the popular author Charles Alexander Johns. They all contributed to the county's <i>hortus siccus</i>, and many herbariums throughout the county. In Johns and his &#145;little books&#146; she found the most important vehicle for her art: she provided several hundred illustrations for his works, including <span class="italic">A Week at the Lizard</span> (1848) and <span class="italic">Forest Trees of Britain</span> (1847). Most notably she has been identified as the artist responsible for most of the illustrations that appeared (anonymously) in Johns's hugely popular compendium for amateur botanists, <span class="italic">Flowers of the Field</span>, first published in 1851 and going through numerous editions thereafter. All were published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, which reproduced the woodcuts used in these books in further countryside and botanical books by later authors. Stackhouse's illustrations appear in at least fifteen and perhaps over thirty publications from 1870 to 1890, after the deaths of both of the original partners in the work.<br>
<br>Stackhouse's own writings were largely unattributed (from &#145;a lady&#146;) contributions to the newsletters and journals of the Royal Institution of Cornwall, but in two articles, &#145;List of the musci natives of Cornwall&#146; (<span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall</span>, April 1865) and &#145;Rare plants in the neighbourhood of Truro&#146; (ibid. 1866&#150;7), she established her credentials as a recognized writer and scientific investigator. She also assembled a herbarium containing her collections of grasses and mosses.<br>
<br>Emily Stackhouse and her sister Louisa moved to Truro after their father's death in 1861, when the Trehane estate passed to William Stackhouse Church Pinwill (1831&#150;1926) of the Indian army, himself a distinguished horticulturist who won the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria medal of honour in 1914. She died at her Truro home, in Strangways Terrace, on 1 March 1870, having been incapacitated by a stroke in the previous year, and was buried in the churchyard at Probus. She left bequests to the Royal Institution of Cornwall, the Royal Infirmary of Cornwall, and the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, and a legacy of unknown proportion to the world of botanical illustration.<br>
