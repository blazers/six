<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walter,  John</span>  (1739?&#150;1812), <span class="occ">printer and newspaper proprietor</span>, was born in London, the third son of Richard Walter (1704?&#150;1755?), coal merchant, and his wife, Esther. The couple had two other sons: Robert (1731?&#150;1785) and Richard (1733&#150;1773). John Walter began in the coal business at about the age of sixteen, immediately after the death of his father. He married Frances Landen (<i>d</i>. 1798) on 31 May 1759, with whom he had four daughters and two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28637/', "John Walter (1776&#150;1847)")</script>, later proprietor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He also had an illegitimate child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29696/', "Walter Wilson (1781&#150;1847)")</script>, with Catherine Wilson. He traded as a coal merchant for twelve years and became head of the firm of Walter, Bradley, and Sage and chairman of the coal market. Although he was initially successful and made a great deal of money, in later years Walter began to find the business less profitable, and decided instead to concentrate on insurance underwriting; he joined Lloyds in 1781. However, a combination of American privateers, French men-of-war, and a hurricane off Jamaica forced him into bankruptcy the following year. Walter had to leave a house in Battersea Rise, Clapham, which he had owned for ten years, but was allowed to keep most of the contents of his residence in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, except for his valuable library, which was sold. He appears to have been determined to clear his debts, and this he seems to have managed by 1790.<br>
<br>After this financial disaster, Walter relied on his friends to secure him a government post, but the dismissal of North's administration in 1782 ruined his chances. He then decided to turn his attention to another type of career altogether, and specifically to developing a new method of typographical composition. This had been invented by the London printer Henry Johnson for use in the making of lottery blanks, which Walter hoped to extend to the general letterpress. This method used &#145;logotypes&#146; or founts composed of complete words instead of separate letters, which was supposed to speed up composition and cut down on printing errors. In 1782 Walter bought the patent to the logographic system and worked with Johnson on developing it further. Two years later, and supposedly with money given to him by his creditors on the settlement of his bankruptcy, he purchased the former King's Printing House in Blackfriars and reopened it as the Logographic Press on 1 June 1784. From the start, Walter appears to have obtained the job of printing &#145;Lloyd's list&#146;, the daily shipping news, presumably because of his earlier connections. In the following year Walter began to print a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Daily Universal Register</span>, using his logographic method. In 1789 he changed the title of the paper to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Although the paper was to become relatively successful in Walter's lifetime, it was not until the early nineteenth century, under the leadership of his son John, that it became the best-selling and most influential newspaper in the country. Walter's own input to the content of <span class="italic">The Times</span> before then appears to have been limited. The paper's politics were almost certainly decided by an editor, and were not particularly distinctive. Under Walter, <span class="italic">The Times</span> was overshadowed by more opinionated and successful newspapers such as the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>.<br>
<br>In addition to his newspaper, Walter also published books and pamphlets at his Logographic Press, as well as undertaking some official printing work for the government. He failed in his attempt to become printer to the Stationery Office, but in 1787 he secured the position of printer to the customs office. A connection with John Trusler of the Literary Society also ensured a steady supply of new works, which included the infamous <span class="italic">Apology for the Life of George Anne Bellamy</span>. Despite Walter's attempts to improve the quality of printing, his publications were often attacked for their frequent typographical errors. Undeterred, in 1789 he opened a bookshop in the West End. However, the book publishing side of his business does not appear to have flourished. The word &#145;logographic&#146; disappeared from the heading of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1792 and the whole experiment seems to have come to an end. Walter later wrote somewhat disingenuously that the failure was due to a lack of patronage and resistance from journeymen printers:<blockquote>I was advised to get a number of nobility and men of letters &hellip; to patronise the plan, to which his majesty was to have been the patron. But happening unfortunately, as it turned out, to correspond with Dr. Franklin, then ambassador at Paris, whose opinion I wished for, his name was among my list of subscribers &hellip; Thus ended royal patronage; and when it [the invention] was used by me in business, the journeymen cabaled and refused to work at the invention without I paid the prices as paid in the common way. Thus all the expense and labour I had been at for some years fell to the ground. (Walter to Lord Kenyon, 6 July 1799, <span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 552)</blockquote>With the failure of the logographic method, the newspaper side of his business increasingly predominated, and was the source of most of his profits. From 1788 <span class="italic">The Times</span> was edited by William Finey, and the paper appears to have enjoyed a period of success, claiming sales of almost 3000 per day in 1792 and 4000 in the following year. In 1790 Walter also began an evening paper, the <span class="italic">Evening Mail</span>. However, his success was not without its problems. On 15 March 1786, for example, Walter was fined &pound;50 for a libel in <span class="italic">The Times</span> on Lord Loughborough. Much greater trouble was to come. Like other newspaper proprietors of the period, Walter received money from the Treasury to ensure a degree of favourable coverage. During the later 1780s and 1790s this amounted to &pound;300 a year. Part of the agreement required Walter to publish certain paragraphs approved by the government. However, this turned out to be a disastrous bargain for Walter, since on 21 February 1789 he printed articles from Thomas Steele, the joint secretary of the Treasury, which accused the royal dukes of insincerity in celebrating the king's recovery from illness and of conducting an opposition party. Steele's articles were declared by the courts to be libels on the royal dukes. Walter was sentenced in November to a &pound;50 fine and a year's imprisonment for his attack on the duke of York. While still in prison, Walter was further tried for libels on the prince of Wales and the duke of Clarence, and sentenced to an additional &pound;200 in fines and a further year in prison.<br>
<br>Walter complained bitterly of his sentence. In a letter written from Newgate to Bland Burges he railed:<blockquote>Little did I ever expect ever to be an inhabitant of this vile receptacle or that any political sin would doom me to so severe a sentence. I am the more astonished when I daily read in the Opposition prints the most atrocious libels and treasonable paragraphs against those who gave birth to my prosecutors and yet without notice. (<span class="italic">Letters and Correspondence</span>, 157)</blockquote>Some years later, Walter noted that &#145;Had I disclosed the authors and their employers, I might have escaped prosecution myself, and proved it on others&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 552), but instead he remained silent. One of Walter's daughters, Mary Knox, appealed to the prince of Wales. This, in addition to Walter's letters of complaint to various politicians, appears to have had some effect; he was released on 9 March 1791 and &pound;250 was given to him from the Treasury, apparently as a form of compensation.<br>
<br>In 1795 Walter retired from active involvement in his printing business and moved to a house in Teddington. He claimed in 1799 that his earlier imprisonment had &#145;produced a corpulence of habit, and I was frequently attacked by fits of the gout&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kenyon MSS</span>, 552). His wife, Frances, died at Printing House Square on 30 January 1798. His elder son, William Walter, took over from his father for a time, although he was not a success and two years later was joined by his brother, John Walter, who took over completely in 1802. Walter's government subsidy was stopped abruptly in 1799 following the publication in July of a paragraph criticizing the administration, and his position of printer to the customs board was also ended. The same year also saw him convicted of a libel on Lord Cowper. In 1800 Grenville declared <span class="italic">The Times</span> to be &#145;a paper which, under cover of a pretended support of Government, is in decided hostility to it&#146;  (Lord Grenville to the earl of Carysfort, 16 Dec 1800, <span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 6.409).<br>
<br>Walter died on 16 November 1812 at Teddington. It has been suggested that he may have fallen out with his son John at some point, since his will failed to leave him a majority share in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, which the son had effectively saved from failure after 1795. Instead John Walter's daughters, Anna, Catherine, Fanny, and Mary, were left one-sixteenth share each, as was his illegitimate son, Walter Wilson, and his nephew, also John Walter, who had already been given three shares in 1801, 1806, and 1810. The pattern of ownership that resulted from Walter's will produced lengthy and costly litigation which continued for many years.<br>
