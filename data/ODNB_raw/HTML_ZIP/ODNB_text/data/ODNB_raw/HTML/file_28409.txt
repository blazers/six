</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wake,  William</span>  (1657&#150;1737), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born on 26 January 1657 at Blandford Forum, Dorset, the son of Colonel William Wake (1628&#150;1705), a royalist army officer, and his wife, Amie, the daughter of Edward Cutler. The Wake family was staunchly royalist: William's father, who was involved in John Penruddock's uprising, his grandfather, and his uncle were all imprisoned on numerous occasions for their loyalty to Charles I and Charles II. Just before his sixth birthday the young William entered Blandford Free School under Mr Welstead. On Welstead's resignation he moved to a private school which was opened at Iwerne by Mr Curgenven, the former usher of the free school, returning to Blandford when Curgenven was appointed headmaster. From Blandford he went to Oxford, where he matriculated as a commoner at Christ Church on 28 February 1673. Securing the favour of John Fell, the influential dean, Wake was admitted as a student (an equivalent post to fellow in other colleges) on 12 July 1675, before proceeding BA on 26 October 1676 and MA on 29 June 1679. Despite the wishes of his father that he return to Dorset and become a farmer, he was ordained deacon by Fell, at that time bishop of Oxford, on 25 September 1681 and was priested on 12 March the following year. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the four lecturers at St Martin's Church, Carfax, Oxford.<h2>
<a name="ParisandLondon"></a>Paris and London</h2>Fell influenced Wake's career decisively once more, recommending him to Richard Graham, Viscount Preston, as chaplain for his embassy to France. Wake served in Paris from June 1682 until September 1685, cultivating a wide acquaintance among both the French Catholic clergy and the Huguenots. There were elements of Catholicism that appealed to him&#151;their &#145;Monastic way of living &hellip; The beauty and Ornaments of their Churches; The solemnity of their Service; Their Care and decency in the performance of it&#146;. At the same time life in France confirmed him in many of the common protestant objections to that religion&#151;its &#145;plain, and notorious Idolatry&#146;, its denial of the right of private judgement, Latin services, &#145;Halfe Communion&#146;, the papal supremacy, and its &#145;narrow and uncharitable Spirit, in Confining Salvation only to their Own Church &amp; Party&#146;  (Christ Church, MS 541A, pp. 10&#150;11). Wake's personal experiences of Catholicism led him to compose his first major publication, <span class="italic">An Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of England</span>, which was a reply to Bishop Bossuet's <span class="italic">Exposition de la doctrine de l'&eacute;glise catholique</span>. This engagement with the leading French controversialist won Wake applause from many leading churchmen. At the core of the pamphlet was a defence of the doctrine of the Church of England on those points where it differed from the Church of Rome. He dealt first with the adoration of saints and images and the doctrine of justification, before devoting long sections to the sacraments and to the authority of scripture, tradition, and the church. He summarized the position of the Church of England as one based on the twin principles of scripture and the practice of the primitive church, arguing that, while he and Bossuet were agreed on &#145;what is <i>most necessary</i>&#146;&#151;belief in God, in Christ, and in the same creeds&#151;they were separated by the innovations of the Church of Rome  (<span class="italic">Exposition</span>, 87).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Exposition</span> was written in France, but it was published only after Wake's return to England, in 1686, the year after James II's accession. Inevitably, its appearance propelled him to the forefront of the Catholic controversy generated by the new king's policies. Over the next two years he produced a sequence of polemical pamphlets, all of which concentrated on the theological differences between the Church of England and the Church of Rome&#151;<span class="italic">A Discourse of the Holy Eucharist</span> (1687), <span class="italic">Two Discourses of Purgatory and Prayers for the Dead</span> (1687), and <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Nature of Idolatry</span> (1688)&#151;and also two catalogues of the tracts produced during the controversy. Gilbert Burnet, indeed, saw Wake as the most important of the many clergymen who rallied to the church's defence in these years  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 3.105). During this time Wake secured the friendship of a number of prominent London clergy, including Thomas Tenison and William Clagett. The recommendation of the former gained him appointment as afternoon lecturer at St Anne's, Soho, while, on the death of the latter in March 1688, the benchers of Gray's Inn elected him as their preacher, despite the opposition of the court. In the summer of 1688 he acted as secretary to the commission established by Archbishop Sancroft to consider liturgical revision as a means of comprehending moderate dissenters within the Church of England. On 1 October 1688 he married Ethelreda (<i>d</i>. 1731), the daughter of Sir William Hovell of Hillington Hall, near Lynn, Norfolk. Ethelreda was the maternal aunt of the antiquary and natural philosopher Martin Folkes. The marriage was performed by another friend, Thomas Sharp, the future archbishop of York, emphasizing the extent to which Wake was at the centre of the powerful group of London clergy co-ordinating the clerical opposition to James II's policies.<br>
<br>Wake's prominence during James II's reign surely entitled him to major preferment after the revolution. That he did not receive it might be explained by Thomas Hearne's claim that &#145;he was of nonjuring Principles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 8.287). In fact, he had no problems in accepting the government of William and Mary, and at the beginning of their reign he was rewarded with a royal chaplaincy, the deputy clerkship of the closet, and a canonry of Christ Church. But the position he adopted at the revolution was a moderate one: unlike many, he had no doubts about the legitimacy of James Francis Edward, prince of Wales, and, while he took the oaths himself, he disliked their imposition on others. Consequently, he took no part in the nonjuring controversy and refused to accept any preferments vacated by the deprivation of nonjurors. Thus he declined the deanery of Worcester, the bishopric of Bath and Wells, and the bishopric of Norwich, while simultaneously feeling piqued at not being offered the deanery of St Paul's or the deanery of Canterbury. His <i>nolo episcopari</i> created &#145;an intire Coldnesse&#146;  (Christ Church, MS 541 A, p. 43) between him and Archbishop John Tillotson and prevented further offers.<br>
<br>Before his death William Clagett had tried to moderate Wake's polemical inclinations, warning him that such work &#145;took us off from other, and better, thoughts&#146;  (Christ Church, MS 541A, p. 20). It was advice that Wake took to heart. Over the next few years he avoided participation not only in the nonjuring controversy but also in the allegiance and trinitarian controversies. He had already established a reputation as a &#145;pious &amp; excellent Preacher&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 4.543), but, from this time, his published sermons, apart from a few delivered on special occasions such as fast days, concentrated on pastoral topics. The piety which they revealed was &#145;unemotional and rational&#146;, emphasizing the &#145;truth and reasonableness of Christian belief and &hellip; the prudential wisdom of its practice&#146;  (Sykes, 1.54). Wake also threw himself into practical pastoral work as the rector of St James's, Westminster, to which he was appointed in 1695, having declined an offer of the same living in 1692 on the grounds of ill health. He established a weekly catechism and increased the frequency of daily prayers to four times in the parish church and twice in King Street Chapel. The most concrete outcome of his ministry at St James's was his catechetical treatise, first published in 1699 under the title <span class="italic">The Principles of the Christian Religion Explained</span>. This quickly established itself as one of the most popular of the longer catechisms, intended for the instruction of more advanced pupils, and it continued to be used through the eighteenth century. Alongside his commitment to pastoral work, Wake hankered after a life of scholarly retreat. During a period of convalescence after illness he produced a translation of the <span class="italic">Genuine Epistles of the Apostolic Fathers</span>, which was published in 1693. Although reprinted twice, this was not a work of original scholarship but of popularization, making available to English readers texts which helped to demonstrate that the Church of England &#145;in all respects comes the nearest up to the <i>primitive pattern</i> of any Christian Church at this Day in the World&#146;  (<span class="italic">Genuine Epistles</span>, vi).<br>
<br>The appearance of Francis Atterbury's <span class="italic">Letter to a Convocation Man</span> in 1697 once more drew Wake into controversy. Prompted to investigate further the history of convocation, Wake was then encouraged by Archbishop Tenison to publish his findings. The central point of his <span class="italic">Authority of Christian Princes</span>, which appeared at the end of 1697, was that Atterbury had failed to recognize the crucial distinction between a parliamentary convocation and an ecclesiastical synod. By controverting Atterbury's parallel between parliament and convocation, Wake was able to undermine the case for restoring a sitting convocation, a conclusion which brought down on him the fury of the tory clergy. This criticism prompted him to publish the <span class="italic">Appeal to All True Members of the Church of England</span> (1698), in which he defended what he saw as the traditional Anglican doctrine of the royal supremacy. Ironically, given his dislike of controversy, this pamphlet was written in a tone of which even some of his friends disapproved, Edmund Gibson lamenting &#145;the provocation given&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Ballard MS 6, fol. 13) to the clergy desiring a convocation. Atterbury's reply, <span class="italic">The Rights, Powers and Privileges of an English Convocation</span> (1700), attacked Wake's scholarship and knowledge of the constitution. Wake's response was magisterial, a folio volume of over 860 pages entitled <span class="italic">The State of the Church and Clergy of England</span>. Based on exhaustive historical research, it quickly established itself as the definitive account of the history of English synods since Anglo-Saxon times and is recognized as a &#145;complete demolition&#146; of Atterbury's work  (Sykes, 1.115). By the time <span class="italic">The State of the Church and Clergy</span> appeared in 1703, however, the ministry had conceded a sitting convocation and the debate had moved on. Wake played no further role in the convocation controversy, but his exchange with Atterbury had established him as the hero of the whig clergy.<br>
<br>It was, therefore, no surprise that the commissioners for ecclesiastical preferments offered Wake the bishopric of Bristol in April 1700. Once more he refused, professing himself content with his life as rector of St James's and bridling at hints from Bishop Burnet that he could expect no further offers of preferment. Archbishop Tenison was angered by Wake's behaviour, clearly feeling that he was putting his own interests before &#145;his duty to the Church&#146;  (Christ Church, MS 541A, p. 50). But a breach between the two was avoided, and in November 1701 Wake accepted nomination to the deanery of Exeter, though he was again irritated by the court's insistence that he resign his canonry of Christ Church. Over the next four years, however, it appears that he continued to devote most of his energies to his parish. He resided little in Exeter, and he certainly did not play the active part in the proceedings of convocation which might have been expected of one of the leading whig clergy in the lower house.<h2>
<a name="BishopofLincoln"></a>Bishop of Lincoln</h2>In 1705 the whig interest at court was again strengthening after a period of tory dominance, and shortly after the death of James Gardiner, bishop of Lincoln, Tenison approached Wake with the offer of the bishopric of Oxford. On this occasion Wake accepted, as he did a week later when he was offered Lincoln instead. According to his own account he had two reasons for this change of mind. First, he received the consent of his dying father, and, second, he was concerned that, if he refused, political manoeuvrings at court might force Tenison to accept the nomination of someone &#145;very unacceptable, if not unfit&#146;  (Jones, 124). As it was, lobbying by other factions, both whig and tory, delayed Wake's promotion until the summer. He was nominated on 16 July and consecrated on 21 October, and he took up residence at the episcopal palace at Buckden, Lincolnshire. Throughout the next decade he was constantly at the centre of the influential group of whig clerics around Tenison, and he met regularly with leading whig politicians such as John, Baron Somers, and Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland. He attended both the House of Lords and convocation regularly, and he made a powerful and effective speech defending toleration during the trial of Henry Sacheverell in 1710; he also used his influence within the diocese of Lincoln to support whig candidates in parliamentary elections. None the less, despite the highly charged atmosphere of the latter years of Anne's reign, Wake avoided the kind of polemical pamphleteering on behalf of the whig cause that had characterized his involvement in the convocation controversy.<br>
<br>If Wake performed the political duties of his new office conscientiously, he was no less energetic in his oversight of his diocese, which was the largest in the country, stretching from the Humber to the Thames and containing more than a thousand parishes. Indeed, he was a model of the new breed of post-revolutionary bishops, who were adapting to problems facing the Church of England in the conditions of <i>de facto</i> religious pluralism brought about by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689. Like many of his colleagues, he placed fresh emphasis on effective episcopal oversight and the diligent performance of their pastoral responsibilities by bishops and clergy alike. He conducted ordinations regularly at least four times a year, he carefully supervised the examination of ordinands, he held regular triennial visitations (though his last, in 1715, was carried out by commissioners), and he confirmed vast numbers of people, more than 18,000 during the 1712 visitation tour alone. It was in the conduct of visitations that Wake revealed himself at his most innovative, shifting the emphasis away from the judicial towards the pastoral. At each of his visitations he circulated a series of written queries to all the parish clergy, which supplemented the traditional articles sent to churchwardens. The aim of these queries was to give the bishop a variety of information about the parish and its people, the provision of services, and the state of charities. The answers were extracted into a <i>speculum</i>, or diocese book, which provided the bishop with a manual for his administration of the diocese. Wake's practice was continued by his successor at Lincoln, Edmund Gibson, and rapidly spread through the church to become the model for eighteenth-century episcopal visitations.<br>
<br>The same commitment to pastoral work was demonstrated by Wake after his confirmation as archbishop of Canterbury on 16 January 1716. Visitations were conducted regularly, in 1716, 1720, 1724, and 1728, following the practice developed at Lincoln. After 1719 Wake himself ordained clergy intending to serve within the diocese, in contrast to most seventeenth-century archbishops who had asked other bishops to ordain them on letters dimissory. Moreover, he continued the efforts of his predecessors to reform standards of clerical practice within the province. In 1716 he issued a circular letter containing instructions for bishops and clergy to tighten up on the admission of ministers to the church and to ensure that curates had an adequate maintenance. In 1724 he issued similar directions to ensure the decency of the administration of the rite of confirmation, and in addition he secured a royal letter to enforce the residence of royal chaplains who were also cathedral prebendaries.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>Wake's appointment as archbishop was warmly welcomed by many clerical whigs, who saw him as the natural successor to Tenison. Gibson commented that &#145;his intire interest in the prince and Princess, with his free Access to the King, and the benefit of speaking French fluently, seem to bid fair for a speedy establishm[en]t of all things upon the right foot&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. A. 269, p. 52). In fact, Wake was a less natural ally for the whigs than was apparent at the beginning of George I's reign. The bitterness of the convocation controversy had pushed him into the whig camp, and during the last years of Anne's reign he firmly believed that the protestant succession, and thus the church itself, was being threatened by the policies of her tory ministry. But he was still the same man who had refused to accept preferments vacated by nonjurors, and even at the time of the Jacobite rising in 1715 he found himself at a loss how to reassure clergy who believed that the church was in danger under the whig administration. The first public evidence of tension occurred in June 1716 when the <span class="roman">Select Vestries Bill</span> came before the House of Lords. This bill, intended to reform the abuses of close vestries in London, reflected the inclinations of anti-clerical whigs by including provisions which would have removed clergymen from participation in parish government and excluded churchwardens from the new vestries. Wake launched such a powerful attack on this measure that he persuaded Lord Chancellor Cowper to admit that &#145;there was not one Sound part in its whole Composition&#146; and to abandon his support of it, thereby ensuring its defeat  (Christ Church, Arch. W.Epist. 7, fol. 125). At least as significant as his triumph in the Lords, however, were the facts that Wake had been forced to oppose a government-sponsored measure publicly rather than privately and that his efforts won him the applause of many tory clergy.<br>
<br>The appointment in April 1717 of the Sunderland&#150;Stanhope ministry, which was committed to a more liberal religious policy, highlighted the gulf that was developing between Wake and the government. In the same month Benjamin Hoadly's sermon, <span class="italic">The Kingdom of Christ</span>, appeared, provoking a storm of controversy about his extreme latitudinarian views, which seemed to call into question not merely the authority of, but even the need for, a visible church. Privately, Wake was incensed by the actions of the bishop of Bangor and his allies, and he denounced those &#145;pastors, bishops, who destroy with their own hands the Church in which they minister&#146;. In particular, he singled out the threat from &#145;a set of Latitudinarian writers&#146; who attacked clerical subscription as a form of ecclesiastical tyranny and were &#145;enemies &hellip; to the most fundamental articles&#146; of the faith  (Sykes, 2.150). But he found that he had little support from the new ministry, which, on 8 May, informed the primate that convocation was to be prorogued in order to shield Hoadly from the threat of synodical censure. Wake was left fuming about the way in which ministers put &#145;their politicall interests&#146; above the &#145;Service of God, &amp; his Church&#146;  (TCD, MS 1995&#150;2008/1815).<br>
<br>Some of Wake's clerical allies, who liked to describe themselves as &#145;Church Whigs&#146;, blamed the archbishop for a lack of leadership. Gibson urged him to attend court more often, reminding him of Tenison's advice that &#145;tho' he could do noe great good &hellip; yet he could hinder mischief&#146;  (Christ Church, Arch. W.Epist. 20, fol. 437). But there was probably little Wake could have done to influence the religious policy of the ministry, which was committed to legislating in favour of the protestant dissenters. Over the next eighteen months debate focused on the issue of the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. Wake, like all the moderate whig bishops, was resolutely opposed to such a measure, regarding the act as an essential bulwark of the constitutional position of the Church of England and a necessary accompaniment to the toleration. By the end of 1717, however, divisions were opening up between Wake and some of his former allies, notably bishops Edmund Gibson, John Hough, and Lancelot Blackburne. The latter group came to accept the ministry's arguments that some concession had to be made to dissent for political reasons, and they were prepared to support the repeal of the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span>. This group was also becoming concerned about Wake's growing contacts with tory bishops such as George Smalridge and Thomas Manningham, and they feared that he was abandoning the &#145;clear <i>Church whig</i> bottom&#146; adopted by his predecessor  (University of St Andrews Library, MS 5219).<br>
<br>Wake, however, would not countenance even this more limited measure. What is puzzling is why. After all, throughout Anne's reign both clerical and lay whigs had generally opposed tory attempts to outlaw the practice of occasional conformity, and Wake himself had entered his protest against the passage of the <span class="roman">Schism Act</span> in 1714. The key to his behaviour seems to lie in changing circumstances. Whereas before 1714 the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts</span> were seen as paving the way for further erosion of the freedoms granted to dissenters by the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689, by 1717 Wake regarded their repeal as a prelude to further concessions to dissent by a ministry hostile to the established church. Thus, when the legislation finally came before the House of Lords in December 1718, the archbishop again found himself leading the opposition to a piece of ministerial legislation which he denounced as an assault on one of the &#145;Outworks&#146; of the ecclesiastical constitution  (Christ Church, Arch. W. Epist., 8/87). This debate, however, revealed the gulf dividing Wake from the ministry and the court much more starkly than the <span class="roman">Select Vestries Bill</span>. Not only was his opposition ineffective, but he also found that his support on the bench of bishops came primarily from the tories, and he was deeply hurt by what he saw as the desertion of his former whig allies, bitterly denouncing them as &#145;betrayers of the Church&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., Add. MS A. 269, pp. 73&#150;4).<br>
<br>Policy differences lay at the heart of Wake's exclusion from government counsels at the end of the 1710s, but they do not entirely explain it. First, his character made him an awkward colleague. There was, at times, an imperiousness about his utterances and a sensitivity to criticism which inclined him to treat differences of opinion as personal slights. Second, his only close confidant among the whig leadership was Earl Cowper, himself a slightly marginal figure who resigned in April 1718. The ministers most involved in ecclesiastical affairs, lords Townshend and Sunderland, knew Bishop Charles Trimnell far better and were often inclined to turn for advice to him and, increasingly, to Edmund Gibson, the young and politically astute bishop of Lincoln. Third, Wake became embroiled in the split at court between George I and the prince of Wales (afterwards George II). He had always been close to the prince and, especially, the princess (afterwards Queen Caroline), the latter of whom was widely credited with securing the archbishopric for him. When the prince of Wales was instructed to leave St James's in November 1717, Wake continued to wait on the prince and princess at Leicester House, in defiance of the king's instructions. It was hardly a course of action calculated to increase his influence at court.<br>
<br>From 1719 Wake was &#145;pretty much in disgrace&#146;  (Herts. ALS, D/EP F62, fols. 90&#150;91) at court and politically marginalized. There were occasional bursts of activity, but these served merely to emphasize how little influence he possessed. In 1721 he was involved in attempts to pass the <span class="roman">Blasphemy Bill</span>, a misleadingly named attempt to combat Arianism by reinforcing the provisions for clerical subscription. In the following year, supported only by John Potter among the whig bishops, he opposed the passage of the <span class="roman">Quaker Affirmation Act</span>. In 1724 he did at least find support from most of his episcopal colleagues in a protest against masquerades. But by this time, as one observer noted, he was playing almost no part in &#145;Eccl[esiastical] affairs&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 1018, fol. 9). In 1727 the archbishop did have some hopes that his influence would revive when George I died and Caroline, his old patron, became queen. However, within a few weeks it became clear that both Robert Walpole and his &#145;pope&#146;, Bishop Gibson, had survived the change of regime, and Wake retired once more to Lambeth.<h2>
<a name="Thechurchesabroad"></a>The churches abroad</h2>Wake stands out among eighteenth-century archbishops of Canterbury for his commitment to correspondence and engagement with the churches in Europe. Like many whig churchmen of the post-revolutionary era he expressed a strong commitment to the ideal of protestant union, both at home and with the reformed churches abroad. In large part this was an expression of his fear of the threat from Catholicism&#151;even after the flight of James II, he continued to interpret events such as the Nine Years' War as a struggle to defend &#145;the <i>Protestant Religion</i>&#146; against Louis XIV's efforts &#145;to root out the very memory of it from off the Earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermon Preached in the Parish Church</span>, 13). Importantly, he believed that protestants were already united &#145;in a <i>common profession of the same Faith</i>&#146;, that what separated them were only differences over inessentials, and he thus saw no reason why they &#145;should not also be united in the same <i>common Worship</i> of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Exhortation to Mutual Charity and Union</span>, 26).<br>
<br>The elevation of Wake to the primacy was warmly welcomed by many foreign protestants, including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in Hanover, Daniel Ernst Jablonski in Berlin, Jean Le Clerc in Amsterdam, and Samuel Turrettini in Geneva. The new archbishop sought to build on these contacts, and he developed an extensive correspondence with leading protestants throughout Europe. Among the more important initiatives that resulted were the formal authorization of intercommunion with the church in Z&uuml;rich and a series of interventions attempting to reconcile differences among the Swiss churches. Most notable, however, was his involvement, along with Jablonski, whom he had first met at Oxford in 1680, in efforts to bring about a union between the Lutheran and Calvinist churches in Germany. Jablonski, the religious counsellor to Frederick William I of Prussia, believed that the Church of England could act as a formal mediator in negotiations, and Wake responded positively to the suggestion, beginning a correspondence that lasted from 1717 to 1725. Ultimately, the initiative came to nothing, undermined as much as anything by inertia and political differences between the courts of Hanover and Prussia. But confessional distinctions were also a powerful force impeding moves towards union, a fact revealed clearly even by Wake himself, who, despite his belief that differences in inessentials were no barrier to union, could still complain to a foreign correspondent that &#145;there is no dogma more inimical to piety&#146; than the Calvinist doctrine of predestination  (Sykes, 2.59).<br>
<br>Wake was unusual among eighteenth-century Anglicans in his commitment to engagement with foreign protestants; even more remarkable were his contacts with French Catholics. In February 1718 he responded favourably to overtures from Ellies Du Pin, a theologian of Jansenist sympathies at the Sorbonne, about a possible union between the Church of England and the Gallican church. However, what emerges clearly from the ensuing correspondence, much of which was carried on through William Beauvoir, the chaplain in Paris, is that Wake did not envisage a full union, but merely some form of intercommunion. Moreover, any agreement would have to be preceded by a breach between the Gallican church and the papacy. In retrospect, even this aim was clearly unrealistic. Both Wake and Du Pin were looking for doctrinal concessions, which the other party was unlikely to make. Wake, indeed, does not seem to have grasped that the differences between Gallican clergy and the papacy did not imply any dissatisfaction with those points of Catholic doctrine, such as transubstantiation, which were so offensive to protestants. In fact, no formal negotiations ever took place. Wake was nettled by the refusal of Cardinal de Noailles, the archbishop of Paris, to become involved, but Noailles's behaviour emphasizes the fact that Du Pin's initiative was essentially a personal one, on behalf of himself and a few professors at the Sorbonne, which had no support from either the French government or the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Finally, early in 1719, an abrupt end was put to the exchanges when the French secretary of state seized Du Pin's papers.<br>
<br>None the less, Wake did continue to correspond regularly with two other French clergymen, Piers de Girardin, another professor at the Sorbonne, and Pierre Le Courayer. The correspondence with Le Courayer, which began in 1721, is of particular note, as it reveals that Wake gave considerable assistance to Le Courayer in the preparation of his <span class="italic">Dissertation sur la validit&eacute; des ordinations des Anglois</span> and then in the defence of that work after its publication in 1723. Wake clearly remained committed to the ideal of intercommunion, and he believed that could be advanced by convincing Gallicans that the Church of England enjoyed an unbroken episcopal succession. Significantly, however, he offered little help to Le Courayer in defending his discussion of the sacrificial character of the mass and in his attempts to reconcile the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> and <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> to Roman teaching. On these issues, his attitude was that the Gallican church had to accept the position of the Church of England. Yet that was not going to happen&#151;these were precisely the issues which led to episcopal censures of Le Courayer in August 1727 and prompted his flight to England.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>Politically marginalized after 1719, Wake lived in semi-retirement at Lambeth and focused his attentions increasingly on preparation for the next life. He himself called his existence &#145;almost a monastic life&#146;  (Thomson, 2.85), which was not an inappropriate description of a regime which included divine service four times a day within his household. He continued to discharge the business of his diocese, he corresponded actively with his foreign friends, and he roused himself to organize the order of service for the coronation of George II and Queen Caroline in 1727, but he had been prone to illness throughout his life, and there is little doubt that his strength was declining. He performed his last visitation of his diocese in 1728 and carried out his last ordination in person in September 1730. That year he suffered a serious illness, prompting satires about the race to succeed him as archbishop, and on 15 April 1731 his wife died. In the following year he was experiencing severe difficulties in writing and he consecrated his last bishop&#151;thereafter all consecrations were carried out by commission. By this time Wake was relying heavily on his son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63758/', "John Lynch (1697&#150;1760)")</script> in the administration of his diocese and as secretary. Lynch had married Mary, the sixth and youngest of Wake's daughters. As the only clergyman among the archbishop's immediate family&#151;the elder five daughters, Amy, Etheldred, Hester, Dorothy, and Magdalen, had all married gentlemen&#151;he accumulated some of the best preferments in his gift. Even in an age that accepted the responsibility of public figures to provide for their families, Lynch's extensive pluralism became a subject of some scandal in Wake's declining years; the most vivid of numerous attacks was a satire depicting him as an ass loaded with preferments. Wake died at Lambeth on 24 January 1737 and was buried on 9 February alongside his wife in the south chancel of Croydon parish church. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> estimated that he left &#145;upwards of &pound;100,000&#146;, and among his bequests were &pound;1000 for the charity school in his native Blandford  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 7, 1737, 61).<br>
<br>Wake was a distinguished historian. His <span class="italic">State of the Church and Clergy of England</span> was widely regarded as the definitive account of English synods well into the twentieth century, while his researches enabled Le Courayer to provide an account of the consecrations of Archbishop Parker and Bishop Barlow, a crucial episode in the defence of the validity of Anglican orders, to which modern historians have been able to add little. He was also an innovative, reforming bishop, who established the model for eighteenth-century episcopal visitations. To contemporaries, however, he was probably most admired for that part of his career which he valued least, namely his work as a controversialist, first against popery in James II's reign and later in the convocation controversy. His role in the convocation controversy, and the attacks upon him by the &#145;high flying&#146; clergy who supported Atterbury, ensured that he became identified with the whigs and the church party around Archbishop Tenison. Other things also drew Wake to the whigs and their low-church allies during the reigns of William and Anne. He was a strong supporter of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689, he adopted an eirenic approach to foreign protestants, he condemned those clergy who denounced lay baptism as invalid, and, in characteristically low-church fashion, he believed that the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> were framed so that &#145;they may, without an equivocation, have more senses that one fairly put upon them&#146;  (Sykes, 2.32&#150;3). But the party labels of this period tend to obscure rather than reveal Wake's churchmanship, as other elements of his thought were more characteristic of high-churchmen. He was attracted to the beauty and solemnity of Catholic worship, he could appreciate the religious value of monasteries and nunneries, he could sympathize with the stand taken by the nonjurors, he placed considerable emphasis on the value of antiquity and tradition in elucidating Christian doctrine, and, despite his commitment to the principle of toleration, he could still regard English dissenters as &#145;a buisy, indefatigable generation&#146;  (TCD, MSS 1995&#150;2008/1929). It is not surprising that he was an uncomfortable ally for whig ministries after the Hanoverian succession.<br>
<br>Since Wake's death it is probably the enterprise that was closest to his own heart, his work for church union, that has attracted most attention. In the eighteenth century his correspondence with the Gallican church was seen as treading &#145;upon the heels of Popery&#146; by latitudinarians such as Francis Blackburne, who believed that there had been &#145;few such renegadoes to&#146; the principles of protestantism  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.12). Wake did not lack defenders, but from the mid-nineteenth century assessments have become more consistently positive as Anglican interest in dialogue with other churches has increased. Norman Sykes is typical of modern opinion in regarding his ecumenical work as &#145;the most outstanding of his achievements&#146;  (Sykes, 2.267). But the fact that he was accorded a two-volume biography by the leading twentieth-century scholar of the eighteenth-century church, the only Georgian bishop to be so honoured, tells us at least as much about the priorities of the modern Church of England as about its history in the decades after the revolution of 1688. Ultimately the singling out of Wake's foreign correspondence for special attention&#151;it occupies one-third of Sykes's biography&#151;is unconvincing. As W. R. Ward has suggested, it is necessary to locate that correspondence in the context of Wake's other concerns in the years after the Hanoverian succession. The search for church union should not be regarded as a precursor of the ecumenical movement of the twentieth century. Rather, it was another means of shoring up the church's defences in response to the threats from Arianism and Socinianism, from latitudinarianism among the clergy and from the liberal religious policies of some whig politicians.<br>
