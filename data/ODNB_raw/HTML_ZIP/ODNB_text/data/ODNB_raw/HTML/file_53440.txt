</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White, Sir  Dick Goldsmith</span>  (1906&#150;1993), <span class="occ">intelligence officer</span>, was born on 20 December 1906 at 119 High Street, Tonbridge, Kent, the youngest of three children of Percy Hall White, an ironmonger and agricultural engineer, and his wife, Gertrude (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Farthing), of Edenbridge. White's early childhood was comfortable, but his father was over-ambitious in business and careless with money, and in 1913 the family endured a financial crash. White never forgot the shock of the sudden collapse into near penury. In 1917 he was sent to Bishop's Stortford College. Although he was initially seen as a rather quiet and self-contained schoolboy, his potential gradually became clear, and in his final year he was captain of cricket, rugby, and athletics, at the last of which he excelled. In 1925, having applied unsuccessfully to join the Royal Navy, he went to Christ Church, Oxford, to read history. There he came under the influence of the history don J. C. Masterman, who was to be a mentor, friend, and wartime colleague. White, tall, slim, fair-haired, and blue-eyed, made his mark on college and university life as a man at once unassuming and accomplished. A good though not outstanding student, congenial rather than gregarious, he won a blue as a middle-distance runner. Although he narrowly missed a first in his finals, he secured a two-year Commonwealth Fund fellowship to study American history in the United States. White enrolled at the University of Michigan, a useful choice outside the Ivy League which brought him into America's heartland. During his two years in America he travelled widely and for a time studied in California, although without completing any substantial piece of work. He returned home in 1930 uncertain what he should do with his life, although he hankered after the world of letters. He sought an opening in journalism, spent some weeks in Florence learning Italian, and briefly took up and then abandoned a postgraduate exhibition at Christ Church. After an inconsequential and unsettled year he drifted into teaching, initially by supervising a group of public schoolboys visiting Australia and New Zealand under a Dominions Office travel scheme. Early in 1932 he was appointed a schoolmaster at Whitgift School in Croydon. There, it appeared, White had finally found his niche. He quickly made his mark both in the classroom and on the playing field as a gifted and compassionate teacher and an inspiring coach, and he seemed set fair for a career in education; his lifelong friend Denis Greenhill believed that, had he remained in teaching, he would have become &#145;a great headmaster&#146;.<h2>
<a name="RecruitedtoMI5"></a>Recruited to MI5</h2>That White swapped Whitgift for Whitehall was completely a matter of chance. While taking part in a British public school tour of Australia and New Zealand White had met Lieutenant-Colonel Malcolm Cumming, who subsequently joined the security service in 1934. Cumming had been impressed by White, and duly recommended him to his MI5 superiors for appointment. A few months later White was approached by Guy Liddell of MI5 and was invited to join the service. The decision to accept cannot have been easy for White: he enjoyed teaching, and the job he was being offered in a small and shadowy Whitehall agency staffed mainly by superannuated army officers promised neither a decent salary nor eventual public rank and esteem. But he thought that a war was coming and he could see the value of the work to be done, so after consulting Masterman and deliberating for a time he took the plunge in January 1936.<br>
<br>White was the first recruit to join the Security Service as a graduate, and almost its first without previous military or police experience. His first role was appropriate to someone of his academic background and experience: he was sent in the guise of an advanced student on a nine-month tour of Germany. His task was to observe and to learn rather than to recruit agents or to spy. He perfected his German, and he obtained a valuable insight into the nature of the Nazi regime, while also experiencing the vicissitudes of operating under cover.<br>
<br>On his return to London, White was assigned to counter-espionage, concentrating on the activities of German diplomats in Britain. Modest, willing to learn from others, and incisive, he quickly won acceptance in a service which, despite its hidebound image&#151;particularly as afterwards portrayed by academic imports into wartime Whitehall&#151;had by 1937 succeeded in penetrating the German embassy as well as making contacts with other anti-Nazi Germans, and White dealt with some of these ideologically motivated sources. By the time war was declared, MI5 had enjoyed some success against individual German intelligence operations, although it did not then have a clear view of the overall threat. Officers were successfully running the important double agent Snow, and through him and other sources had obtained a good deal of information on German plans for espionage and sabotage in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Careful management of Snow and of other spies caught in 1939&#150;40 saw the elaboration of the practice whereby captured agents were induced to feed back false and misleading information to Germany and to claim that they had built up networks of sub-agents and informers. In January 1941 an inter-services group, the Twenty (or double-cross) Committee, was established to identify genuine material which could safely be provided for these controlled agents to send back to Germany. This was the genesis of the double-cross system. It soon became clear that almost all enemy agents operating in the United Kingdom were already under British control, a conclusion supported by intercepted German intelligence radio traffic. Within MI5 White, along with other officers including the highly experienced T. A. (Tar) Robertson, played a crucial role in the subtle development of double-cross from a highly successful counter-intelligence operation into an instrument of strategic deception under the overall direction of the chiefs of staff. This work brought White into an interdepartmental milieu for which he was well suited: in partnership with Masterman, who was one of a number of academics and lawyers brought into MI5 during the war and who became secretary of the Twenty Committee, he was able to represent MI5's viewpoint firmly but without creating friction.<br>
<br>White brought to the management of double agents an insight into character, a sureness of touch, and an ability to command the confidence of those with whom he dealt. These were attributes also to characterize his post-war career: even in the poisonous and sometimes paranoid world of secret intelligence, people who met him respected and trusted him. His ability to inspire confidence and to bring people along with him was reflected not only in his standing within the service. In 1943 White was drawn into the planning of counter-intelligence organization and operations in support of the invasion of France, and from then until 1945 he was largely occupied with European security affairs. He worked closely with Eisenhower's staff, including Walter Beddell Smith, a future head of the Central Intelligence Agency. At the very end of the war, by then holding the military rank of brigadier, he was involved in the inter-allied investigation which concluded that Hitler had indeed died in his Berlin bunker. In 1945 he was honoured with the award of the French Croix de Guerre and appointment to the American Legion of Merit. On 28 November that year he married Kathleen (Kate) Somers Tomkinson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bellamy (b. 1911/12), who already had a daughter by a previous marriage; they had two sons. White's family life was close-knit, and he was never happier than when at home.<br>
<br>The evolution of double-cross saw a parallel&#151;though not commensurate&#151;rise in MI5's standing within Whitehall. By 1945 there were hopes that its success in developing and managing double-cross, in the face of difficulties which sometimes lay as much in Whitehall as in Berlin, would secure the service a central role in strategic deception in any future military conflict. In the event, the advent of the cold war brought such a weight of security problems, in addition to those arising from pressures for decolonization throughout the empire, that this planned dimension of MI5's post-war activities never took shape.<br>
<br>In 1945&#150;6 White toured the Commonwealth and colonies, both to review and advise on local intelligence and security arrangements and to trawl for talent for MI5. This experience gave him an insight into the range of overseas problems which Britain was to face over the next twenty years as decolonization gathered pace and as the pressures of the cold war grew in Asia and Africa. Within the service he was already seen as a future chief, though he wore the mantle of the coming man lightly and he avoided office intrigues.<h2>
<a name="Postwaractivities"></a>Post-war activities</h2>In 1945 the director-general of MI5, Sir David Petrie, retired, and Percy Sillitoe, a former chief constable, was appointed to succeed him. This was not a happy choice: Sillitoe brought to MI5 the outlook and management style of a tough provincial policeman, and he had no experience of intelligence affairs. Furthermore, he was unable to adapt to the ways of Whitehall, and this was to cost MI5 dearly when the first post-war security crises broke. White and other senior officers, while uneasy with Sillitoe, kept the show on the road, and the service prospered modestly as a result of its wartime successes. It recruited able and experienced officers from the armed services and from colonial administrations, and it maintained a network of former officers, friends, and contacts within Whitehall and the academic and legal worlds. Furthermore, the very close intelligence and security links with the United States built up during the war were assiduously developed. Here White's personal standing was crucial: his friend Denis Greenhill wrote that &#145;Dick was not one of those Englishmen who thought that the fact that our secret service could trace its ancestry back to Queen Elizabeth I assured its superiority for all time&#146;, and even in the darkest days of the interlinked crises of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, and of Kim Philby, the Americans never lost confidence in him personally. The security services of other friendly states inside and outside the Commonwealth held him in equally high regard: in 1981 an ailing former director of Irish military intelligence particularly asked a mutual acquaintance to tell White that &#145;he's a great man&#146;.<br>
<br>The decade after 1945 saw the revelation, through a series of spy scandals centred first on the Anglo-American atomic weapons programme and second on the Foreign Office and the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), of considerable long-term Soviet penetration of the British establishment. Although the machinations of the Comintern and the activities of the Communist Party of Great Britain had been among MI5's principal inter-war concerns until the mid-1930s, in contrast to its first pre-war successes against German espionage, which had helped to lay the foundations for its spectacular wartime achievements, its surveillance of known communist groups and front organizations had left it completely unaware of the parallel but more sophisticated subversive activities of Soviet agents operating independently to recruit Englishmen as long-term agents. The result was that during the war a coterie of very able traitors had worked their way into key positions, including Donald Maclean in the Foreign Office, Anthony Blunt in MI5, and especially Kim Philby in SIS. Even when the reality of Soviet penetration of the atomic bomb project was brought to light with the detection of the scientist traitors Alan Nunn May and Klaus Fuchs, and despite warnings from Soviet defectors, Whitehall and in particular the Foreign Office failed to appreciate that the same techniques of ideological seduction could well have been used against other officials.<br>
<br>In the public furore and the Whitehall storm that followed the disappearance of Burgess and Maclean, MI5 emerged in an unfavourable light. Sillitoe was out of his depth, and it fell to White and other senior officers to defend the service externally, to initiate a thorough trawl for other Soviet agents, and to begin to repair relations with the American intelligence agencies. This work was greatly complicated by the fact that within Whitehall opinion was bitterly divided about Philby, under suspicion as a result of the tip-off to Maclean. Investigation and interrogation of this most able of dissimulators proved inconclusive, although White and other MI5 officers concluded that he was a traitor. But many in SIS thought Philby innocent, and after his career officially ended in 1951 he was publicly exonerated by the foreign secretary in 1955.<br>
<br>In 1953 Sillitoe retired from MI5, to the great relief of the service. White was selected to succeed him. This was widely welcomed within MI5 on account of his record, his personality, his high standing with the Americans, his good relations with Commonwealth intelligence services, and his understanding of Whitehall. He brought calm where there had been chaos, he secured the service's flank against attack from other departments, he was incisive and persuasive on paper and in person, and he commanded the confidence of ministers. He instituted a radical reorganization of MI5, including the creation of a separate personnel and recruitment division. He also secured Treasury approval for the long-overdue introduction of a proper career structure along civil-service lines. This enabled the service systematically to recruit and to retain good personnel. White's greatest difficulties during his years as director-general of MI5 arose not in managing internal change or in coping with external criticism of the service's failure to detect Soviet penetration, but in overseeing the necessary post mortems and in supervising the hunt for other Soviet agents within the establishment. In retrospect it is clear that more might have been done earlier to ascertain the extent and persistence of infection; at the time, however, MI5 had to strike a delicate balance between prudence and paranoia.<h2>
<a name="InSISandCabinetOffice"></a>In SIS and Cabinet Office</h2>After three years at the helm in MI5 White was abruptly transplanted to the very different world of SIS. This unexpected move was a consequence of the Commander Crabbe imbroglio, a freelance SIS operation against a Soviet cruiser visiting Portsmouth which went disastrously and publicly wrong. The head of SIS, Sir John Sinclair, was pushed out, and White was offered his post. He accepted out of duty, not ambition: he liked running MI5, and must have been apprehensive about the reaction he would encounter in the rather different world of 54 Broadway. In truth his appointment came more as a relief than a joy to SIS. While he was well known and generally liked, like his reviled predecessor Sinclair he came from outside the service. He had no personal experience of foreign intelligence gathering&#151;he once ruefully remarked to a subordinate that he wished that he had run agents in the field, as he felt that he would then have had a better grasp of the human pressures under which SIS officers worked&#151;but he had vast knowledge of counter-intelligence, he understood Whitehall, he had excellent international contacts, and he could manage. As head of SIS his approach, once he had imposed a necessary reorganization, was to concentrate on the service's external relations with Whitehall and the wider world and to let his directors get on with their jobs, a style which contributed to a perception among some field officers that he was aloof and out of touch.<br>
<br>White's achievements as head of SIS are hard to estimate. He undoubtedly succeeded in restoring morale and in improving relations with the Foreign Office and the Cabinet Office. But secret intelligence operations of their nature are not intended to become public knowledge for a very long time, if ever, and it is uncertain what the organization did or failed to do under White's direction in cold war and other spheres of activity. The biggest known success was the recruitment of the Soviet agent Oleg Penkovsky, who provided an astonishing stream of technical intelligence on Soviet missile technology, crucial during the Cuban missile crisis, until his arrest and execution in 1963; the greatest public disaster was the treachery of the SIS officer George Blake. Philby's betrayal still cast a long shadow, but the Penkovsky success, together with White's presence as head of SIS, went far towards repairing Britain's standing with the American intelligence community.<br>
<br>When the time came for White to retire in 1968, the selection of a successor proved difficult. In the event White was succeeded not by the outstanding internal candidate Maurice Oldfield but by Sir John Rennie, widely regarded as a Foreign Office cast-off beset by serious family problems. His performance was to vindicate his critics. Some felt that White should have tried to prevent that appointment, but the outgoing head of a department has no right of veto on his successor and to oppose the Foreign Office might have been to make enduring trouble for SIS.<br>
<br>On his retirement from SIS, White was appointed to the newly created post of co-ordinator of intelligence in the Cabinet Office. This innovation was seen as the brainchild of the cabinet secretary, his one-time Whitgift pupil Sir Burke Trend, who took a keen interest in intelligence matters and who particularly valued White's unrivalled experience of the secret world and his advice on international and security affairs. The appointment of White to this novel position was not without its critics, and it is fair to say that only a man of his standing, tact, and judgement could have made a success of it without provoking monumental rows. White eschewed any temptation to turn the post into an overlordship of the various intelligence agencies or otherwise to throw his weight around, and instead concentrated on giving advice when asked. Some argue that this approach was tantamount to doing nothing at all, but there is no doubt that White's personal contribution was valued in the Cabinet Office. His influence was crucial in securing government approval for the preparation under F. H. Hinsley of the multi-volume official history, <span class="italic">British Intelligence in the Second World War: its Influence on Strategy and Operations</span>, an enterprise that demonstrated the extent of MI5's wartime successes both in counter-espionage and in strategic deception as well as the achievements of Britain's code-breakers. In 1972, feeling rather worn out, he retired from Whitehall for good.<br>
<br>In retirement White spent most of his time gardening and reading&#151;his literary streak remained strong, and some of his poetry was circulated among former colleagues. In 1981 he was elected an honorary student of Christ Church, a distinction of which he was very proud. He became as accessible to researchers and journalists as a man could safely be who knew so many state and private secrets, and in 1981 he wrote to <span class="italic">The Times</span> to deprecate the claim that Roger Hollis had been a traitor. Some in Whitehall faulted his judgement in retirement in making himself so accessible, arguing that he was ignoring rules and procedures which he had enjoined on others when in office. He was on particularly close terms with the journalist Andrew Boyle, whose book <span class="italic">The Climate of Treason</span> (1979) led to the exposure of Anthony Blunt; he later granted interviews to the BBC producer Tom Bower, whose rather inappropriately titled <span class="italic">The Perfect English Spy: Sir Dick White and the Secret War, 1935&#150;90</span> appeared in 1995. Dick White was not a spy at all, but an able, patriotic, and humane leader of men who, exceptionally for one who headed successively the two most secret arms of government, commanded enduring trust across Whitehall and Westminster. White was appointed OBE in 1942, CBE in 1950, KBE in 1955, and KCMG in 1960. He died after a long illness at his home, The Leat, Burpham, near Arundel, Sussex, on 21 February 1993; his wife, Kate, survived him.<br>
