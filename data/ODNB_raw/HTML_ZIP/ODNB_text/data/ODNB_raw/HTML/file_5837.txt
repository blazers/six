<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colby,  Thomas Frederick</span>  (1784&#150;1852), <span class="occ">surveyor and army officer</span>, was the eldest child of Major Thomas Colby (<i>d</i>. 1813), Royal Marines, and his wife, Cornelia Hadden, sister of Major-General John Murray Hadden, Royal Artillery, surveyor-general of the ordnance. He was born in the parish of St Margaret, Rochester, on 1 September 1784, brought up by his father's sisters at the family home, Rhos-y-gilwen, near Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, and educated at school in Northfleet, Kent, and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. At sixteen he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, in which he was to serve for the rest of his life. As a cadet Colby attracted the notice of William Mudge, superintendent of the Ordnance Survey, who in 1802 asked that Colby be attached permanently to the survey. This granted, Mudge came increasingly to rely on Colby, whose work he admired and whom he found sympathetic.<br>
<br>Colby's first duties were to help Mudge measure an arc of the meridian between Dunnose, Isle of Wight, and Clifton, south Yorkshire. In December 1803, when on duty at Liskeard, Colby was badly wounded when an overloaded pistol accidentally went off. His left hand had to be amputated at the wrist, his face was very badly scarred, and fragments lodged in his skull. Helped by youth, the care of friends, and the surgeons' reluctance to attempt further operations, Colby recovered and was able to return to active duties. As was normal, he divided his time between fieldwork in the summer and computing results and superintending the construction and engraving of maps in the Tower of London in the winter. He and Mudge published an account of their progress in <span class="italic">An Account of the Trigonometrical Survey &hellip; 1800&#150;1809</span> (1811). In July 1809 Mudge was appointed lieutenant-governor of the Woolwich Academy and Colby became chief executive officer of the survey.<br>
<br>From 1813 to 1817 Colby was engaged in extending the measurement of the meridional line between Dunnose and Clifton into Scotland, in combination with a geological survey under John McCulloch. Colby was helped by James Gardner, but carried out much work himself. Because of Mudge's ill health Colby took charge of a visit to Shetland by Jean-Baptiste Biot who had been deputed by the Bureau des Longitudes to make pendulum and other observations there in connection with the extension of the arc of the meridian from the Balearic Islands, through France, and thence through England to Shetland. However, Biot's and Colby's intense mutual dislike resulted in British observations being made on Balta and French on Unst; this defeated the political and scientific objectives of the enterprise which were to demonstrate Anglo-French co-operation and compare results obtained using the Ramsden zenith sector with those obtained using the French repeating circle. Colby, however, afterwards accompanied Mudge and his son to Dunkirk and took part in the observations made, in conjunction with Biot and J. F. D. Arago, with Ramsden's sector, which was set up in Dunkirk arsenal. Colby was again in Scotland in 1819, when his extraordinary activity is evident from his having covered on foot more than 1000 miles in mountainous terrain in forty-five days.<br>
<br>In 1820 Mudge died and Colby took the unusual step of writing to the duke of Wellington, then master-general of the ordnance, to press his case for appointment as superintendent of the survey. He was successful and was appointed that year. He immediately set about addressing problems: he instituted changes that led to an increase in sales of previously very slow-selling maps and, by ruthlessly rejecting sub-standard work and that done by unauthorized assistants, raised standards appreciably. In 1820 he was appointed to the board of longitude, on which he served until its dissolution in 1828. In 1821 he was again employed in Scotland and in 1821&#150;3 was deputed by the Royal Society, with Captain Henry Kater, to work with the astronomers Arago and Matthieu of the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences to verify observations made forty years earlier connecting the triangulations of England and France. For cross-channel observations, Fresnel lamps with compound lenses 3 feet in diameter were used, and Colby's description of them influenced Robert Stevenson to adopt them in British lighthouses.<br>
<br>In 1824 a survey of Ireland at a scale of 6 inches to the mile was ordered, to allow the valuation of property so that the inequitable system of land taxation could be reformed. Colby was put in charge of the survey while continuing to be responsible for work on the British mainland. A comprehensive system of primary, secondary, and minor triangulation was necessary for the precise fixing of property boundaries. Colby determined to put the work under direct official supervision, instead of contracting the work out to civil surveyors as was often done in England. He obtained approval for raising three companies of sappers and miners to be trained in survey duties. The Irish survey was begun with a small party of sappers on Divis Mountain near Belfast in 1825. As the work progressed Colby perfected a system of checks which allowed the employment of Irish labourers on routine tasks. Dissatisfied with previously used instruments, Colby designed and perfected through experiment his compensation bar, using which a base-line 8 miles long was measured under his supervision in 1827&#150;8 and later described in <span class="italic">An Account of the Measurement of the Lough Foyle Base</span> (1847). Colby was helped by Thomas Drummond, whose family claimed that the invention was his. Two of Colby's 3 foot compensation bars were used by the parliamentary committee to redefine the yard after the original was destroyed by fire in 1834. Colby held the view (later widely accepted) that national survey research could be extended to produce memoirs on the place names, geology, natural history, antiquities, and other features of the country. Sadly his ideas were overruled by financial considerations after the publication of one Irish memoir. Lack of trained men slowed progress in Ireland but Colby managed to resist attempts to make him adopt quicker but less accurate methods.<br>
<br>In 1828 Colby married Elizabeth Hester Boyd, second daughter of Archibald Boyd of Londonderry, treasurer of that county; they had four sons and three daughters. After their marriage Colby and his wife moved from London to Dublin, but the family returned to London in 1838 and then went to Southampton when the Ordnance Survey moved there in 1842.<br>
<br>Under Colby's superintendence in May 1833 the first Irish county map&#151;Londonderry, in fifty sheets&#151;was published. Other maps were published in quick succession with 2 or 3 million acres being published annually, until by completion in 1847 nearly 2000 sheets had been published of maps whose detail, accuracy, and pleasing appearance represented a cartographic achievement of world importance. The work had employed thousands of people and cost &pound;720,000. Colby consistently and considerably exceeded his annual budget so as to maintain progress, for some time forgoing his salary, which he was unable later to recover. His insistence on rigorous if expensive methods meant that the resultant maps could be used to draw boundaries for poor-law assessment and valuation as well as for general valuation, the compilation of annual agricultural returns, the census, the sale of property, land improvement, and general engineering works. In addition a full series of tidal observations, later commended by the astronomer royal, were made under Colby's direction at stations around Ireland. In Ireland Colby built up from virtually nothing an unrivalled topographical corpus. He and Thomas Larcom also introduced electrotyping (whereby maps can be reproduced from duplicate plates without wearing out the original) and contour lines.<br>
<br>In 1833, while the Irish survey was still in progress, Colby was ordered to work with Henry De la Beche to prepare a geological map of the west of England. The Ordnance Survey was to finance the project and engrave the maps and De la Beche to supply geological information&#151;an arrangement which continued until 1845. Colby moved to the mainland in 1838, leaving the Irish survey in the hands of Thomas Larcom, and became involved in the &#145;battle of the scales&#146;. In 1840, after various scientific bodies in England and Scotland had pointed to the advantages of a 6 inch survey on the Irish pattern, the government agreed that the six unsurveyed counties in the north of England and the whole of Scotland should be surveyed and mapped at the scale of 6 inches to the mile, while the 1 inch map was published for the rest of England. As men involved on the Irish survey completed their work, they were transferred to England and some thence to Scotland. The work was moving very slowly when, in November 1846, Colby was promoted major-general; in accordance with the rules of the service he retired from his survey post the following April.<br>
<br>In retirement Colby devoted himself to the education of his sons, living for some time in Bonn. He died unexpectedly at New Brighton, near Birkenhead, on 9 October 1852. His widow was awarded a life pension by the government. Colby was a knight of Denmark (a distinction conferred in recognition of help given by the Ordnance Survey to Danish geodesists under Heinrich Schumacher), a fellow of the Royal societies of Edinburgh and London, LLD of the University of Aberdeen, and a member of various learned societies. Living in London and having some private means he took a keen interest in science. In appearance Colby was short and the best likeness of him is said to be the bust in the Ordnance Survey office in Southampton. He was extremely dexterous in using instruments, despite having lost one hand. He could be difficult to work with and fell out with several colleagues, one of whom, his biographer, Portlock, none the less described him as &#145;gentle and kind as a father&#146;. He was an energetic and active participant in all the work he supervised and the high standards on which he insisted make his superintendence of the survey a noteworthy period in its history.<br>
