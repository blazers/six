<span class="headword">Holland,  Richard</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Sir Richard Holland]</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1483), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and poet</span>, is best remembered as the author of the alliterative verse <span class="italic">The Buke of the Howlat</span>. Of his background, education, and early career little is known. The records generally style him &#145;priest of Caithness&#146;&#151;probably a reference to the diocese in which he was ordained&#151;and he may have been a native of Orkney, where he would later spend some ten years. It was his status as a priest which led to his being usually referred to as Sir Richard Holland. By 1444 he was in possession of the prebend of Kirkmichael in the diocese of Ross. He subsequently sought to exchange this for the archdeaconry of Caithness (1445), a move that led to an acrimonious three-year dispute with Alexander Sutherland, which he seems eventually to have lost. Holland was described as the rector of Halkirk, near Thurso, in 1450 and of Abriacher in the diocese of Moray in 1451. In 1452 he was provided to the canonry and prebend of Croy and a year later he was presented to the precentorship of Moray, another disputed benefice. His career was closely associated with the fortunes of the powerful Black Douglas family, in particular those of Archibald Douglas, earl of Moray, who in a charter of 1450 referred to Holland as his secretary. This charter was one of several witnessed and drawn up by Holland in his capacity as a notary public, which he had become no later than 1441. Although the exact circumstances surrounding the connection between Holland and his patron are unknown (it may have originated in the service of the earl's wife), he was clearly suited to this type of office.<br>
<br>Indeed, Holland's skills went beyond the secretarial, and some time about the year 1448 he composed <span class="italic">The Buke of the Howlat</span>, written, according to the final stanza, at Darnaway Castle and dedicated to the countess of Moray, Elizabeth Dunbar. Recognized as the earliest major poem of the Scottish alliterative revival, its 1001 lines are arranged in 13-line alliterative stanzas with wheel, a form which was to remain in use in Scotland throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Holland's work offers a novel and amusing twist on the bird-assembly poems popularized in the fourteenth century, most notably Chaucer's <span class="italic">Parliament of Fowls</span>. The tale centres on a howlat (owl), who, lamenting his ugliness, is given a feather by each of his fellow birds. His overweening pride in his new appearance causes him to be stripped of his apparel, underlining the well-worn adage:<blockquote>
<div>That pryde never yit left<br>
</div>
<div>His feir but a fall.<br>
</div> (Amours, 80)</blockquote>As well as acting as moral exemplum, the poem is distinguished by the richness of its description, particularly of the two bird courts (papal and imperial), and provides vivid glimpses of contemporary opinion of clerical standards and of the life of a fifteenth-century aristocratic household.The poem, its dating, and its possible allegorical significance have all been the subject of considerable debate. Internal evidence has led late twentieth-century critics to suggest dates of 1446, 1448, and 1450, while attempts to decode a hidden warning in the work have seen the unfortunate owl as James II, the powerful Livingston family, or the Douglases themselves. On balance, however, the poem seems less a warning to the Douglases than a passionate validation of the dynasty, celebrating its well-established tradition of loyal military service and glossing over the family rivalries of recent years. Certainly, if the poem was written in the summer of 1448, then it would have formed part of a programme of Douglas activity, of which the concluding event, a lavish tournament staged at Stirling Castle in 1449, also acted as a reminder of the family's carefully cultivated reputation as the &#145;wer wall&#146;, or rampart, of Scotland.<br>
<br>It was a message little appreciated by James II. He launched an aggressive campaign to destroy Douglas power in Scotland that culminated in royal victory at the battle of Arkinholm on 1 May 1455, when Moray was killed and his brothers forced into exile. Immediately following this Holland was at Darnaway, named among the countess's men placed under the protection of the earl of Huntly. The changed political climate of the late 1450s clearly rendered him uneasy, and by 1457 he had retreated to Kirkwall to serve as vicar of Ronaldsay and canon of Kirkwall Cathedral. A deed of collation dated 3 June 1467 refers to his demission of this benefice and it was probably then that he left for England, where he was apparently active in the Douglas cause. In 1480 a Richard Holland, clerk, was sent to Scotland by Edward IV, and the continuing support he gave his erstwhile patrons presumably explains his exclusion from an act of parliament of 1482 offering remission to all those who forsook the traitor James Douglas. Holland seems to have spent the rest of his life in political exile in England and in 1483 was placed under official royal protection. Thereafter he disappears from the records, and it is not known when he died. His literary reputation, however, survived. Praised by William Dunbar in his &#145;Lament for the Makaris&#146; (between 1505 and 1508) and David Lindsay in <span class="italic">The Testament and Complaynt of our Souerane Lordis Papyngo</span> (1530), Holland's verse was preserved in the two great sixteenth-century manuscript collections Asloan (between 1513 and 1530) and Bannatyne (1565&#150;8), and was also among the first works published by Scotland's nascent printing industry about 1508.<br>
