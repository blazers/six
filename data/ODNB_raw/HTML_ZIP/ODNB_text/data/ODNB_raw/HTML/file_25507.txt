<span class="headword">Sibthorp,  Charles de Laet Waldo</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Colonel Sibthorp]</span>  (1783&#150;1855), <span class="occ">politician</span>, the second of five sons of Colonel Humphry Waldo Sibthorp (1744&#150;1815) and his wife, Susannah, daughter of Richard Ellison of Thorne in Yorkshire and Sudbrooke Holme in Lincolnshire, was born on 14 February 1783 at North Mimms, Hertfordshire. The Sibthorps were a long-established gentry family which had close connections with Lincoln. The Oxford professor of botany Dr Humphrey Sibthorp (1713?&#150;1797) was Charles's grandfather; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25509/', "John Sibthorp")</script>, the botanist, was his uncle, and the clergyman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25510/', "Richard Waldo Sibthorp")</script> was his youngest brother.<br>
<br>Sibthorp attended a school in Chiswick and matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1801, but did not graduate. He was commissioned in the Scots Greys in 1803 and subsequently served in the Peninsular War as a captain in the 4th dragoon guards. In later life he always saw himself as a military man. He married on 21 February 1812 Maria, daughter of Ponsonby Tottenham, from co. Wexford, Ireland. They had four sons, but she was estranged from him in later years, although reconciled before his death.<br>
<br>On the death of his elder brother Coningsby in 1822, Sibthorp succeeded to the family estates. He left the army, and was elected, in 1826, member of parliament for Lincoln, a borough which had previously been represented by his brother, his father, his great-uncle, and his great-grandfather. He also followed in a family succession as colonel of the South Lincoln militia, and was a deputy lieutenant and magistrate for the county. Except for a brief interval in 1833 and 1834, when Sir Edward Bulwer ousted him by a small majority, Colonel Sibthorp continued until his death to be re-elected for Lincoln, on personal rather than on political grounds, and often unopposed.<br>
<br>Sibthorp was an industrious parliamentarian and a very active participant in debate. He tenaciously adhered to ultra-tory and ultra-protestant views and defied fashionable and progressive trends. Partly by his uncompromising opinions, partly by his blunt expressions, and partly by an eccentricity that did less than justice to his real abilities, he made himself for many years rather a notorious than a respected figure in political life. His moustachioed and bewhiskered face and colourful style of dress were frequently caricatured. Charles Dickens considered him &#145;the most amusing person in the House&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sketches by Boz</span>, 1837, 233). His speeches were sometimes witty and polished, but they were too often personal and offensive. He opposed in all their stages the <span class="roman">Catholic Emancipation Bill</span> and the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, considering the latter worse than the cholera morbus because it undermined the ancient constitution  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 14.1285). Sibthorp claimed that the &#145;Chandos&#146; clause of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, which gave the vote to &pound;50 tenants at will in the counties, had originally been his own idea  (ibid., 9.811). The provision in the act to make better provision for the residence of the clergy (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 106, section 36), which enabled widows of deceased incumbents to retain possession of the parsonage house for two months after the incumbent's death, also was strongly supported by him.<br>
<br>Sibthorp opposed the ministerial proposal for a grant of &pound;50,000 per annum to Prince Albert on 27 January 1840, largely from suspicion of foreign influences, and it was his amendment for its reduction to &pound;30,000 which, with the support of Peel, was eventually carried. He was a die-hard opponent of free trade, savagely denouncing Peel's &#145;betrayal&#146; of the country in 1846 and adhering to the tory rump who censured Lord Derby for abandoning protection in 1852. His denunciation of the 1851 Great Exhibition arose in large measure from his associated anxiety to protect British industry from foreign competition. His xenophobia had religious as well as economic roots: he was staunchly protestant (but not evangelical) and was unflagging in his opposition to the expansion of the Roman Catholic church in England. His feelings on this subject were no doubt intensified by the conversion of his brother Richard Waldo to the Church of Rome in 1841. He was also inveterately hostile to railways, particularly because of their encroachments on private property, and was instrumental in preventing Lincoln from being served by a main line.<br>
<br>Sibthorp died at his house in Eaton Square, London, on 14 December 1855, after a long illness, and was buried at Canwick church, near Lincoln. His eldest son, Gervaise Tottenham Waldo Sibthorp (1815&#150;1861), succeeded him as MP for Lincoln.<br>
