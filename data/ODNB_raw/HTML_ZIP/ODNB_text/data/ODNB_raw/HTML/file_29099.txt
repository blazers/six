<span class="headword">West,  Thomas</span>, eighth Baron West and ninth Baron de la Warr  (1472&#150;1554), <span class="occ">soldier and courtier</span>, was the son and heir of Thomas West, seventh Baron West and eighth Baron de la Warr (1448&#150;1525), and his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh Mortimer of Mortimer's Hall, Hampshire, where West was probably born. The younger Thomas was made a knight of the Bath on 29 November 1489, the occasion of the creation of Henry VII's son Arthur as prince of Wales, and in 1492 he may have been admitted to Gray's Inn. By August 1494 he had married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1474), daughter of Sir John Bonville of Halnaker, Sussex. It was through her that West inherited Halnaker in 1498, which was to be his seat for forty years.<br>
<br>West attended the funeral of Henry VII and was a server at the coronation of Henry VIII, and for the first twenty years of the new reign he fulfilled all the duties of the eldest son of a provincial lord. He undertook administrative duties as a JP in Sussex and Hampshire, and was sheriff of Sussex in 1524&#150;5. He fought in the French wars of 1513&#150;14, where he was knighted, and served again in France in 1522&#150;5. He was present at the wedding of the king's sister Mary to Louis XII of France in August 1514, the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520, and the meeting with the emperor Charles V in 1522. He was appointed a carver at court in 1521, and witnessed the creation of the king's bastard son Henry Fitzroy as duke of Richmond in June 1525. In October that year his father died, and West inherited the de la Warr barony. Consequently his duties increased, although he was usually able to appoint a proxy for parliament, pleading poverty. He did, though, sit on the panels of peers summoned to condemn Anne Boleyn and her brother in 1536, and lords Darcy and Hussey in 1537. He also carried out ceremonial duties by uncovering the basins for the presiding bishop at Prince Edward's baptism in October 1537, and by carrying the canopy for the funeral of the queen in the following month.<br>
<br>During the 1530s, however, de la Warr became increasingly dissatisfied with the regime. He was close friends with Viscount Lisle, the marquess of Exeter, and Robert Sherburne, bishop of Chichester, all ageing conservatives who were unhappy with the reforms of the 1530s. De la Warr's intimate friend George Crofts, a prebendary of Chichester, said that he had never found de la Warr wavering from his conservative opinions regarding the intercession of the saints, pilgrimages, purgatory, free will, and justification, and Anthony Wayte, Bishop Sherburne's servant, told Lady Lisle that de la Warr was &#145;the whole stay of our corner of Sussex, for if we lacked him we might well say to have lost the greatest part of wealth and catholics, for he is surely a good lord and just&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lisle Letters</span>, 2.265).<br>
<br>None the less, de la Warr was prepared to conform, and he was made a commissioner of oaths for the royal supremacy in Sussex in 1534. Given his own beliefs, and the friends that he kept, this was undoubtedly an act of policy by the government. When Crofts told his friend that he was planning to flee the kingdom, de la Warr persuaded him to conform, and Crofts, too, took the oath of supremacy.<br>
<br>De la Warr's conservative conformity is best seen in the dissolution of Boxgrove Priory. As owner of Halnaker, de la Warr also inherited the rights of the priory's founder, and in the early 1530s he established a chantry there. However, when the prospect of dissolution arose in 1536, he immediately wrote to Thomas Cromwell in the house's defence. He pleaded for Boxgrove's survival as a priory, but if it were to be dissolved he asked that he might have the farm. He reiterated this request a few months later, asking also if he might buy the ornaments, and that the church of the priory might remain as a parish church. De la Warr can be seen as sincerely wishing to preserve the priory, but eventually conforming, and by doing so making the best of a bad lot, both for himself materially, and spiritually for the locality. Following its dissolution de la Warr was granted a lease of the priory, and the commissioners reported back to Cromwell that &#145;the King, by the vigilance and diligence of lord Lawarre, has more profit there than in any other house dissolved in Sussex&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 12/1, no. 747).<br>
<br>Yet despite his conformity de la Warr nearly came unstuck in 1538 through what has become known as the Courtenay conspiracy. During 1537 and 1538 Henry VIII's cousin Cardinal Pole was trying to raise Catholic Europe in a crusade against schismatic England. Towards the end of 1538 Pole's brothers, mother, and close friends were suddenly arrested, allegedly on the discovery of a plot against the king. It is now generally accepted that no such plot existed, although it is not clear whether Henry was making a pre-emptive strike, or whether it was simply a useful time to remove the last of the Plantagenet line.<br>
<br>Several of de la Warr's intimate friends were arrested, including the marquess of Exeter, Sir Geoffrey Pole, and George Crofts. De la Warr feared that he too would be arrested, shouting up to Bishop Sampson of Chichester from the pavement outside his palace that he must defend him if he were attacked. The bemused bishop carefully responded that if de la Warr was innocent there would be no need. But de la Warr was right to be worried, for throughout October and November 1538 the interrogations of the accused, and depositions of others, show that the regime was becoming increasingly interested in him. Sir Geoffrey Pole told his interrogators that de la Warr had grumbled against the regime throughout the 1530s, discussing a better world with Pole, although he was less interested in Pole's opinions after the king had stayed at Halnaker during his progress through Sussex in 1536. Crofts told them that in his opinion de la Warr had never wavered in his traditional beliefs, and that de la Warr had persuaded him to conform and take the oath of supremacy against his conscience. He also told them that although de la Warr had condemned the Pilgrimage of Grace, he had said that the peers had only been prepared to condemn Lord Darcy because they had been led to believe that he would receive a royal pardon. Most worrying was the evidence of de la Warr's own brother-in-law, Sir Henry Owen, who stated that he had heard de la Warr openly criticizing acts of parliament, and saying that God would punish the dissolution of the monasteries and the reading of new English books.<br>
<br>On 1 December 1538 de la Warr was examined by seven prominent members of the privy council. They wrote to the king saying that they could find no sufficient ground for sending him to the Tower, though they had placed him under house arrest. However, the next day he was transferred to the Tower. It is not clear exactly what accusation was made against de la Warr. His examination took place on the day before the trials of his friends, and in the light of his comments about the trial of Lord Darcy it might be that he refused to serve on the panel of peers trying them. Otherwise, the worst that could be laid against him was that he had known of Crofts's objections to the supremacy and had not reported them. However, de la Warr was not perceived as a threat like Exeter or Montagu, and was a useful magnate in Sussex, so he was released on 21 December, undertaking with a bond of &pound;3000 to appear before the council when summoned. This was not to be his only punishment, however, for early in 1539 the king, who had taken a liking to Halnaker, suggested an exchange of land. De la Warr's forgiveness was clearly dependent on this, and he agreed to exchange his home of forty years for the nunnery of Wherwell in Hampshire. At the same time his bond was discharged. From 1539 de la Warr lived at Offington, Sussex, where his father had lived before him.<br>
<br>De la Warr continued to act as an important provincial lord after his release from the Tower. As early as February 1539 he was being trusted to defend the Sussex coast, suggesting that he had never seriously been suspected of conspiracy, and he was made vice-admiral for Sussex in 1543. He attended the reception of Anne of Cleves in January 1540, and in March 1542 he held the mantle for the creation of John Dudley as Viscount Lisle. The latter had been a ward of de la Warr's brother-in-law, Sir Edward Guildford, and his mother had married de la Warr's friend Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle. This connection gave the conservative de la Warr protection under Edward VI, and was no doubt influential in gaining him the Garter in December 1549. He continued to be a leading agent for the government in Sussex, serving on the commission to collect church plate from 1552, and as lord lieutenant of Sussex from 1551. Dudley's support must have been particularly helpful in 1549 when de la Warr placed a private bill before parliament to disinherit his nephew <a name="cosubject_29103"></a><span class="headword">William West</span>, first Baron De La Warr  (<em>c.</em>1519&#150;1595)<span class="occ"></span>. The latter was the son of the ninth baron's half-brother Sir George West of Warbleton (<i>d</i>. 1538) and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Morton of Lechlade, Gloucestershire. His uncle was childless, and had at some time adopted William as his heir. However, West tried to gain the de la Warr estate early by poisoning his uncle. The attempt was unsuccessful and he was in the Tower by October 1548. He was disinherited by an act of parliament in 1550, although he had been reinstated as heir by the time of his uncle's death.<br>
<br>Despite his links with Dudley, de la Warr did not help him in his attempt to place Jane Grey on the throne; indeed, he was given an annuity by Queen Mary for his assistance against the duke. He was admitted to the privy council on 17 August 1553, but seems to have attended only two meetings. He died at home at Offington on 25 September 1554 and was buried on 10 October, with his father in the church at Broadwater, Sussex. Henry Machyn, in reporting his funeral, gave him the epitaph of the &#145;best howsse-keper in Sussex&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Henry Machyn</span>, 71).<br>
<br>Now reinstated as his uncle's heir, William West was unable to inherit the barony owing to the act of parliament. Some time previously he had married Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Strange of Chesterton, Gloucestershire; after her death he married Anne, widow of Thomas Oliver and daughter of Henry Swift of Andover, Hampshire, who survived him. Involved in the Dudley conspiracy, West was arraigned in the Guildhall on 30 June 1556. He insisted on answering the charge as William, Lord de la Warr, forcing the heralds to prove that he had no right to the title. He was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. The punishment was not carried out, however, and he was pardoned in 1557, shortly before fighting for the queen at St Quentin. In 1563 he was restored in blood by Elizabeth I, and on 5 February 1570 he was knighted and created Baron De La Warr. This was regarded as a new creation, and in his lifetime he sat in the House of Lords as junior baron. Like his uncle before him he was the government's agent in Sussex, serving at times as lord lieutenant. Unlike his uncle he was a protestant and was particularly active in the prosecution of recusants. No doubt for that reason he took part in the trials for treason of the duke of Norfolk in 1572 and the earl of Arundel in 1589. He died at Wherwell, Hampshire, on 30 December 1595, and his son Thomas succeeded to the barony, successfully claiming the precedency within the peerage that had belonged to his title before his father forfeited it.<br>
