<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sidgwick,  Henry</span>  (1838&#150;1900), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was born at Skipton in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 31 May 1838, the elder brother of the classical scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48597/', "Arthur Sidgwick")</script> and fourth of the six children of the Revd William Sidgwick, headmaster of Skipton grammar school, and his wife, Mary Crofts, whose family came from the East Riding of Yorkshire. William Sidgwick graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1829, and was appointed to his headmastership in 1836. He died on 22 May 1841; his wife survived him until 17 January 1879.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>After being educated privately, Henry Sidgwick was sent to a school run by the Revd H. Dale at Blackheath in 1850, and then in September 1852 to Rugby, where his mother took a house the following year. Edward White Benson, a cousin of the family, took up a teaching post at the school at the same time, and soon came to exercise a strong intellectual and moral influence over Sidgwick. In 1859 he married Sidgwick's younger sister Mary and he went on to follow a distinguished career in the Church of England, becoming archbishop of Canterbury in 1882. Sidgwick was a precocious and bookish boy, not given to the usual energetic sports and outdoor activities; at the age of seventeen he was urged to apply for a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, the great prize for outstanding boys from the school, but, wanting to follow in Benson's footsteps, he chose to go to Trinity College, Cambridge, which he entered in October 1855. From this date until his death forty-five years later Sidgwick was to spend only one term away from Cambridge.<br>
<br>Sidgwick's undergraduate career was one of great distinction: he won the Bell and Craven scholarships in his first two years, was elected a scholar of Trinity, and in 1859 he graduated with a &#145;double first&#146;, top of the list in the classical tripos and thirty-third wrangler in mathematics; he was also awarded the chancellor's medal. In the same year he was elected a fellow of Trinity and appointed assistant tutor in classics. But at least as important as his conventional studies during this period was his membership of &#145;the Apostles&#146;, the highly selective (and secretive) discussion society that had been founded in the 1820s. What Sidgwick so valued about these weekly meetings was the complete frankness and intellectual sincerity with which the society's members were required to express their views, no matter how fundamental or controversial the topic under discussion. It was these gatherings rather than his formal education that revealed to Sidgwick his true vocation, which he later characterized simply as &#145;thought exercised on the central problems of human life&#146;  (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 35).<br>
<br>Inevitably, the central problem for an intellectually serious young man in the 1860s was the problem of &#145;belief&#146;, the problem of the intellectual status of the &#145;truths&#146; of Christianity. Sidgwick, a clergyman's son whose attitudes had been deeply shaped by Benson's practical piety, had begun to have serious doubts about his inherited Anglicanism while still an undergraduate, and in the course of the 1860s he moved, unsteadily and with considerable anguish, towards a more sceptical position, while always hoping that historical research or philosophical reasoning might yet ground the central claims of revealed religion on a more credible footing. He was drawn by turns to the relentless empiricism of John Stuart Mill and the sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, but his was too honest and fastidious a mind ever to subscribe without reserve to any of the great intellectual systems of his age. In the early 1860s he began to learn Hebrew and Arabic in the hope that a study of the historical and textual origins of Christianity might make it possible to winnow the grains of spiritual truth from the chaff of superstitious accretion, but in the course of the decade he moved more and more towards purely philosophical investigations. From this point on, his personal quest and his intellectual career coincided very closely. In 1865 he examined for the moral sciences tripos for the first time, and in 1867 he began lecturing on &#145;mental and moral philosophy&#146;. During the next three decades Sidgwick's was to be the guiding influence in the teaching and administration of the &#145;moral sciences&#146; in Cambridge, studies which at the time included a good deal of psychology, politics, and economics as well as all the main branches of philosophy.<br>
<br>His increasing religious scepticism, together with the public campaign against the restriction of college fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge to members of the Church of England, led the always scrupulous Sidgwick to conclude that he could no longer in good conscience hold an appointment that required formal subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, and so in 1869 he resigned his fellowship and tutorship. The college indicated its regard for his worth, and for his evident sincerity, by immediately electing him to a lectureship (without a fellowship), which allowed him to carry on his teaching as before. Sidgwick's example greatly boosted the campaign to abolish such religious &#145;tests&#146;, a measure eventually carried in 1871. For him the episode was also a pressing example of the kinds of dilemmas faced in practical moral reasoning, an experience that drove him to deeper enquiries into the nature of ethical first principles.<h2>
<a name="TheMethodsofEthics"></a>The Methods of Ethics</h2>It was at about this time that Sidgwick began work on what was to be his major intellectual achievement, <span class="italic">The Methods of Ethics</span>, first published in 1874 and several times revised (the 6th edition was published in 1901). This book has frequently been seen as a defence of utilitarianism, the ethical position associated above all with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, which claims that the ultimate criterion for the rightness or wrongness of actions is to be found in their consequences for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Recent scholarship, however, has convincingly established the work's more systematic and less partisan aspirations. Essentially, Sidgwick was enquiring whether the human mind could establish any principled basis for rationally determining how one ought to act. One of the distinguishing features of the book (in which it is closer to Aristotle than to most modern ethical theory) is the serious attention which it gives to the &#145;morality of common sense&#146; as a defensible guide to action, a feature that has been taken to give the book an ethically conservative colouring. But after much careful analysis Sidgwick concludes that the rules underlying common sense morality can only be given a coherent form and made to yield consistent practical guidance if they are in turn derived from implicitly utilitarian premises. However, he conceded that the axiom of utilitarianism could not be justified within the terms of utilitarianism itself; it required a rationally groundable intuition of the kind that lay at the heart of the rival nineteenth-century ethical doctrine of intuitionism. Moreover, he concluded that there was no rational way to overcome what he called &#145;the dualism of practical reason&#146;, that is, no demonstrable ground for asserting the superiority of rational altruism over rational egoism. The consistent pursuit of one's own interest provided a no less coherent and justifiable principle of action than did the consistent pursuit of the welfare of others, and the first edition of the <span class="italic">Methods</span> notoriously ended with the admission that without some notion of a divine system of reward in the hereafter, this conflict is irresolvable; hence, &#145;the Cosmos of Duty is thus really reduced to a Chaos; and the prolonged effort of the human intellect to frame a perfect ideal of rational conduct is seen to have been foredoomed to inevitable failure&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Methods of Ethics</span>, 1874, 473); the passage was softened and revised in a more optimistic direction in later editions.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Methods of Ethics</span> has been recognized as one of the few indisputable classics in the history of moral philosophy; it was described by the later Cambridge philosopher C. D. Broad as &#145;on the whole, the best treatise on moral theory that has ever been written&#146;  (Broad, 143). Its stature partly derives from its sustained architectonic conception: partial or intermediate conclusions are allowed no rest until they have been chased down to first principles that form part of rational human understanding as such. But much of the book's force also comes from its painstaking analysis of the unobvious subtlety of &#145;common-sense morality&#146; and from its patient demonstration of the adaptability and capaciousness of utilitarian moral reasoning. Its density and restraint meant that it was unlikely to attain the cachet among non-philosophers briefly enjoyed by, for example, the <span class="italic">Principia ethica</span> (1903) of Sidgwick's former pupil G. E. Moore, but it exercised considerable influence over Anglo-American moral philosophy in the twentieth century. The American moral philosopher John Rawls has awarded the book the dubious accolade of being &#145;the first truly academic work in moral philosophy&#146;  (Schultz, 49), while late twentieth-century critical estimation placed it in the company of the ethical treatises of Aristotle, Hume, and Kant.<h2>
<a name="Reformerandprofessor"></a>Reformer and professor</h2>On 4 April 1876 Sidgwick married Eleanor Mildred (Nora) Balfour (1845&#150;1936), who, as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36086/', "Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick")</script>, was a significant promoter of university education for women. She was a sister of the Tory politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30553/', "Arthur Balfour")</script> (a former pupil of Sidgwick's). They had no children. For some years after their marriage, the Sidgwicks lived at Hillside, Chesterton Road. From 1893 they lived in Newnham College. Sidgwick had long been sympathetic to the cause of women's education. In 1869 he helped to initiate a scheme of lectures for women at Cambridge and in 1871 set up, at his own expense, a house for these students, inviting Ann Jemima Clough, sister of the poet Arthur Hugh Clough, to become its superintendent. In 1875 the Newnham Hall Company was formed, supported by public subscription, to finance the first building of what became Newnham's established site, leading to the foundation of Newnham College in 1880, with Eleanor Sidgwick as vice-principal. She succeeded Ann Jemima Clough as principal in 1892 and was one of the college's principal benefactors in her own right. Sidgwick later helped the new college acquire the freehold of its site; in his honour, a road built to replace one occupied by college buildings was named Sidgwick Avenue. He successfully campaigned for the admission of women to university examinations in 1881, and freely gave his time, money, and increasing reputation to further the cause of women's education in other ways.<br>
<br>In 1872 Sidgwick had unsuccessfully applied for the Knightbridge chair of moral philosophy following the death of its holder, F. D. Maurice. At this point he did not have any substantial philosophical publications to his name, and he was passed over in favour of a prominent evangelical clergyman, T. R. Birks. However, when the post next fell vacant following Birks's death, Sidgwick's claims were unrivalled, and he was elected to the chair in 1883. By inclination as well as appointment, his was a thoroughly academic career, and he was one of the earliest figures to have been recognized as a fully professional philosopher. In this spirit, he was a frequent contributor to (and financial supporter of) <span class="italic">Mind</span>, the first specialist journal of philosophy in Britain, founded in 1876. He constantly referred to the obligations of his academic position, and the title &#145;professor&#146; became as constitutive a part of his public identity as the name of his diocese is of a bishop's. In 1881 he was awarded an honorary LLD by Glasgow University and made an honorary fellow of Trinity College. He received further honorary degrees from St Andrews and Edinburgh in 1884, from Oxford in 1890, and from Budapest in 1896.<br>
<br>A cause peculiarly dear to Sidgwick's heart was that Cambridge University should deploy its considerable resources and reputation to enrich the national culture and further international scholarship. He involved himself in numerous schemes of reform designed to move the obstructive federation of sinecure-ridden colleges a little further along the path of becoming a university seriously committed to education and research. In 1877 a commission was established by act of parliament to determine new statutes for Cambridge University and its colleges. When these came into effect in 1882, Sidgwick became a member of the newly constituted general board, the body largely responsible for the academic policy of the university; he retained this position until 1899. In addition, he served from 1890 to 1898 as a member of the council of the senate, as well as being on several other special boards and syndicates, where he devoted countless hours to the numbing minutiae of academic administration. On all these bodies he took a leading part, and there is abundant testimony not just to his grasp of detail and his procedural fertility, but also to the persuasiveness exercised by a personality in which the passion to find the least bad outcome carried the force of disinterested reason. Inevitably, he came to be regarded in some of the more conservative quarters of the university as a troublesome meddler, and occasionally his schemes would fail as a result of their excessive ingenuity and complication, as in an abortive scheme to extend the taxation of the colleges for university purposes. He also supported several new academic ventures with his own money, financing professorships and readerships, helping to sustain an arrangement for the education of future members of the Indian Civil Service, making a substantial donation towards the costs of a building for the department of physiology, and so on. As one obituarist observed: &#145;His truest monument is &hellip; the difference between Cambridge as it is now and the Cambridge of forty years ago&#146;  (Schultz, 364).<br>
<br>As a teacher, Sidgwick was too cautious and too thorough (and, as a lecturer, too boring) ever to attract a large undergraduate following, but he won the unstinted devotion of a small number of able pupils. He was wryly self-conscious about the contrast between his own lack of popularity and the crowded lecture-halls that hung upon the not notably clear words of his Oxford counterpart, the neo-Hegelian philosopher T. H. Green. His ingrained scepticism debarred him from imparting a doctrine or message; it was rather the example of his unceasingly probing analytic method that impressed itself on his admirers, most of whom, such as the historian F. W. Maitland, were not destined to be professional philosophers. As his one-time pupil and eventual successor W. R. Sorley put it, &#145;his teaching was a training in the philosophic temper&#151;in candour, self-criticism, and regard for truth&#146;  (Schultz, 2).<h2>
<a name="Politicalphilosophy"></a>Political philosophy</h2>This analytical method&#151;&#145;i.e. the method of reflection on the thought we all share, by the aid of the symbolism we all share, language&#146;  (H. Sidgwick, <span class="italic">Philosophy: its Scope and Relations</span>, 1902, 49)&#151;was deployed with particularly telling effect in the two treatises that represented Sidgwick's attempt to bring professorial rigour and detachment to bear upon the major questions of policy and legislation. <span class="italic">The Principles of Political Economy</span> (1883) was an intellectually conservative work in two ways: first, its analytical or deductive method signalled its adherence to the style of classical political economy, rather than adopting the more historical or more mathematical approaches then in vogue; and second, it included within the scope of the subject not just the &#145;science&#146; of economic analysis, but also the &#145;art&#146; of political economy, that is, an examination of the (limited) role of state action in economic life. Implicitly, the work attempted to fend off the twin challenges to the status of traditional political economy posed by the late nineteenth-century enthusiasm for socialism and sociology. Sidgwick accepted the criticism of the historical school to the extent of acknowledging that the premises of political economy were not timeless truths, but he maintained that they did &#145;correspond broadly to the facts of modern societies&#146;  (p. 36). Moreover, his focus was upon matters of policy, on how to decide what to do under present conditions&#151;a task, he argued, for which the fashionable emphasis on historical and cultural diversity was of only limited value. The book was regarded respectfully by the increasingly professionalized economists of the next generation, but Sidgwick was, as John Maynard Keynes later observed, one of the last of those who &#145;could take [economics] in his stride&#146; as &#145;one Moral Science out of several&#146;  (Collini and others, 309).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Elements of Politics</span> (1891) was informed by a similarly practical purpose. As Sidgwick explained, in characteristic terms:<blockquote>The primary aim of the political theory that is here to be expounded is not to supply an entirely new method of obtaining reasoned answers to political questions; but rather, by careful reflection, to introduce greater clearness and consistency into the kind of thought and reasoning with which we are all more or less familiar. (p. 1)</blockquote>In this vein, the book addressed itself to institutional and procedural matters as well as to more purely theoretical issues, attempting to show how analytical reasoning based on &#145;certain propositions as to human motives and tendencies which are derived primarily from the ordinary experience of civilized life&#146;  (ibid., 11) issued in broadly utilitarian conclusions. But as one reviewer noted, &#145;If this is Benthamism, it is Benthamism grown tame and sleek&#146;  (Collini and others, 291), and Sidgwick's practical concentration on the kinds of consideration which were at the heart of policy-making by the late-Victorian governing &eacute;lite meant that the work displayed none of Bentham's strong critical antagonism to the political institutions of his time. Though <span class="italic">The Elements of Politics</span>, like Sidgwick's other treatises, never achieved any popular success, for some years it enjoyed considerable academic standing (a 4th edition was published in 1919), but it was thereafter largely neglected by historians of political theory.<br>
<br>In his early years Sidgwick had been a frequent contributor to the periodicals of general culture, writing essays on a range of literary, historical, and cultural subjects (some of which were included in the posthumously published <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Essays and Addresses</span>, 1904), but from the 1870s onwards he increasingly concentrated upon his work in moral and political philosophy. His later treatises had usually first been sketched in courses of lectures, and his occasional pieces were now predominantly published in the recently established specialist journals. At the time of his death he had been preparing <span class="italic">The Development of European Polity</span> (1903) for publication, and a further three volumes deriving from his professorial lectures were published posthumously: <span class="italic">Philosophy: its Scope and Relations</span> (1902), <span class="italic">Lectures on the Ethics of T. H. Green, H. Spencer, and J. Martineau</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant and other Philosophical Lectures and Essays</span> (1905). His little handbook <span class="italic">Outlines of the History of Ethics for English Readers</span>, which had first appeared in 1886, was published in its fifth edition in 1902, and continued to be used for teaching purposes for many years.<h2>
<a name="Otheractivities"></a>Other activities</h2>A major expression of Sidgwick's open-minded search for truth about the &#145;ultimate questions of human life&#146; (especially, in this case, the possibility of an afterlife) was his interest in psychical research. Throughout his adult years, Sidgwick eagerly collected reports and conducted experiments concerning various alleged manifestations of psychic phenomena, from hypnotism and hallucinations through thought transference to &#145;table-rapping&#146; and other supposed communications from the dead. He was active in the founding of the Society for Psychical Research in 1882, serving as its first president, and he and his wife took leading parts in the society's efforts to secure intellectual respectability for its proceedings. In conducting these investigations Sidgwick was far from credulous, always sought corroborated and verifiable evidence, and participated in the exposure of several fraudulent mediums or spiritualists. But he continued to devote much time, energy, and money to these enquiries, combining a never entirely stilled scepticism with a never entirely abandoned hope.<br>
<br>Another aspect of Sidgwick's constant efforts to expand the range of shared truths about fundamental questions was his membership of discussion societies made up of distinguished individuals who held very divergent religious and philosophical beliefs. He was a founder member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/45584', "Metaphysical Society")</script> (1869&#150;80) and later of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96304', "Synthetic Society")</script> (1896&#150;1900), as well as a member of several groups confined to Cambridge. Characteristically, he observed of the first of these societies that its aim was to attain &#145;not agreement, which was of course beyond hope, but a diminution of mutual misunderstanding&#146;  (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 221). In such discussions, as in his contribution to more public debates, he steered a middle course between the aggressive positivism of the agnostic scientists and the convinced transcendentalism of the orthodox churchmen. The subsequent reminiscences of participants in these discussions concur in reporting how Sidgwick's dialectical ingenuity and resourcefulness, combined with the evident sincerity of his desire to learn from others, soon earned him a commanding position in their company despite a manner that could appear hesitant and even self-effacing.<br>
<br>Politically one of the young &#145;lights of Liberalism&#146; in the 1860s, Sidgwick was on the side of &#145;reform&#146; in both national and academic politics. But his social and economic views reflected the individualism typical of the mid-Victorian intellectual, leaving him increasingly at odds with the more &#145;collectivist&#146; ideas of the 1880s and 1890s, and his cautious and sceptical temperament meant he was bound to be resistant to the various forms of organized enthusiasm in politics. Intellectually, he was an apprehensive political traveller, nervously rehearsing the potential mishaps of any journey and made edgy by the uncertainty of the destination: the longer he studied the brochures for utopia, the more he warmed to the idea of staying at home. Nor was this simply timidity or unimaginativeness, though Sidgwick had his share of those qualities; it sprang, rather, from a kind of unshowy moral seriousness about the temptations to self-deception offered by political excitement, and an intellectual conviction that only immediate consequences could be calculated with any reasonable reliability. After the home-rule split of 1886, he (like many of the other former &#145;academic liberals&#146; of the 1860s) became a Liberal Unionist, a political home that at first appeared to suit his combination of intellectual principle and cautious prudence. However, he greatly distrusted Chamberlain's imperialist adventures, and at the end of his life his deep-rooted liberalism manifested itself in his distaste for the militarism and jingoism expressed in Britain's prosecution of the South African War.<h2>
<a name="Lastyearsandreputation"></a>Last years and reputation</h2>In Sidgwick's last years there was no diminution in the range of his activities. He was president of the second international congress of psychologists in 1892, and a member of the Gresham commission on the University of London from 1892 to 1894; he submitted a memorandum to the royal commission on the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland in 1895 and one to the royal commission on local taxation in 1899; he was prominent in the (unsuccessful) campaign for women to be granted degrees at Cambridge; and he published a collection of his addresses, as <span class="italic">Practical Ethics</span> (1898). At the close of the century he was also the prime mover in establishing a learned body that might represent scholarship in the humanities as the Royal Society did for the sciences, though he died shortly before its official recognition as the British Academy.<br>
<br>Sidgwick's personality seems to have attracted exceptionally wide respect and affection. As one obituarist recorded: &#145;It was impossible to know him without feeling that incomparably the most impressive thing about him was his character. &hellip; There was in him an extraordinary simplicity and goodness&#146;  (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 591). His speech was marked by a slight stammer, which added to his air of sincerity without detracting from his gentle wit. Partly because his tastes inclined to the ascetic, his income easily exceeded his needs, enabling him to be a generous supporter of academic, philanthropic, and personal causes. There has been speculation that Sidgwick was impotent  (Rothblatt, 135). Several of his closest friends, such as Roden Noel and H. Graham Dakyns, as well as his brother Arthur (a master at Rugby and later fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford), were practising homosexuals, but there is no evidence that sexual desire of any kind played a significant part in Sidgwick's life. The surviving likenesses portray the gravity characteristic of widely admired members of the Victorian professional &eacute;lite, while also catching something of the philosopher's partly abstracted liveliness of mind.<br>
<br>In the decades immediately following his death, Sidgwick's reputation suffered as part of the general reaction against &#145;Victorianism&#146;: on reading the <span class="italic">Memoir</span>, the young John Maynard Keynes hyperbolized: &#145;He never did anything but wonder whether Christianity was true and prove that it wasn't and hope that it was&#146;  (Harrod, 135). He was also overshadowed philosophically by the great impact of G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell in the early part of the twentieth century, and subsequently by that of Ludwig Wittgenstein. But the later decades of the twentieth century saw a strong revival of interest in utilitarianism among moral philosophers, and <span class="italic">The Methods of Ethics</span> was widely regarded as a more careful and philosophically more interesting presentation of the utilitarian position than may be found in the work of the leading representatives of that school, such as Bentham and Mill. In addition, the more nuanced and discriminating understanding of Victorian cultural history that has been achieved by recent scholarship has made clear Sidgwick's central role in many aspects of late nineteenth-century British intellectual life.<br>
<br>Sidgwick died of cancer on 28 August 1900 at Terling Place, Terling, near Witham, Essex, the home of his brother-in-law the distinguished physicist J. W. Strutt, third Baron Rayleigh. He is buried in Terling churchyard. Had the Anglican service not been used, his preference was to have the following sentences delivered at his graveside: &#145;Let us commend to the love of God with silent prayer the soul of a sinful man who partly tried to do his duty. It is by his wish that I say over his grave these words and no more&#146;  (Sidgwick and Sidgwick, 599).<br>
